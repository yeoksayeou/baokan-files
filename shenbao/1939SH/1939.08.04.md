### British Ambassador Insists on Two Demands, Tokyo Negotiations Stalled, Japan Sends Major General Mutō to Visit Britain as an Unofficial Envoy, London News: Japanese Army Discouraged by the Trend of Arms Embargo

(Tokyo) Regarding the Anglo-Japanese talks, the Japanese side has not yet received any notification from the British side, so the stalemate had to continue on the 3rd. At 9:45 a.m., Major General Mutō and Major Miyamoto held a two-hour meeting with Minister Katō at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After discussing comprehensive countermeasures on the Japanese side, they visited Major General Beckett at the Kai Kōsha and stated that if the United Kingdom sincerely expressed concrete application methods for general principles, Japan could also seriously consider the United Kingdom's position, and urged that understanding of this proposal be promoted.

(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese negotiations regarding the Tianjin Incident have stalled. The police subcommittee meeting could not be held, and the economic subcommittee also made no progress yesterday. British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie and Katō, the leader of the Japanese delegation at the Round Table Conference, held a private meeting yesterday in Tokyo for a little over an hour. According to Japanese sources, the meeting aimed to prepare the ground for the next plenary session. The plenary session has not been held since July 28. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

(Tokyo) The economic issues that have become problematic in the Anglo-Japanese local negotiations have not been able to continue to this day because the British side has not yet received instructions from its own country. In the afternoon of the 2nd, British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie visited Minister Katō at the Tokyo Club, where Minister Katō pointed out that Japan's demands regarding economic issues were extremely appropriate, that the British side should seriously consider them, and that he hoped the United Kingdom would conduct negotiations with a truly sincere attitude. (3rd Allied Press Dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to the Asahi Shimbun, when British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie met with Katō, the chief Japanese representative, last night, he proposed that economic issues should not be included on the agenda. He also proposed that the Round Table Conference should handle issues of peace and order on the basis of stopping the Tianjin blockade after both sides reached a compromise. It is reported that Katō rejected both of the above proposals. The newspaper also stated that after Katō consulted with Foreign Minister Arita, he immediately met with the British Ambassador at the Tokyo General Meeting last night. Katō immediately reiterated that the Japanese government could not accept these proposals, and expressed the Japanese view that this conference would not be completed smoothly unless the British delegation fully accepted the Japanese demands. Neither the subcommittee nor the Round Table Conference met today, but the British ambassador may meet with Katō again. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

(Tokyo) A semi-official Japanese news agency today published an authoritative statement expressing Japan's attitude toward the anti-British movement in North China and Japan, as well as the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. It said that although Tokyo newspapers carry pessimistic news, believing that the Anglo-Japanese conference has reached a stalemate, the current situation is not so hopeless. The Japanese representative insists on the current procedures adopted for the Anglo-Japanese conference, arguing that economic and police issues cannot be analyzed separately and that agreement cannot be sought solely on the police aspect. Any attempt to separate these two issues contradicts the Arita-Craigie Agreement. As for the anti-British movement in Japan, it is an automatic expression of national sentiment. The popular movement in North China is caused by Britain's pro-Chiang policy. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

(Washington) U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the State Department had sent special instructions to the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, Dooman, instructing him to protest to the Japanese government about the dangers of the anti-foreign movement in the Japanese occupied areas. Welles explained that Dooman had made the protest to Japan on Tuesday in a private conversation, pointing out that the current anti-British movement in the Japanese occupied areas had become a widespread anti-foreign movement. The U.S. government is extremely concerned about this and holds Japan responsible for the current anti-foreign movement. Regarding unofficial reports in the Japanese press that the Japanese government intends to recall the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Welles said that he did not see that the Japanese government would do so. Regarding the compilation of statistics by U.S. consuls in China on disputes between the United States and Japan since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Welles said that U.S. consuls in China may have compiled these statistics based on standing instructions. Although he does not know the exact number of incidents, according to reports received, there have been more than 600 such disputes. Regarding the anti-British movement expanding into an anti-American movement, Welles said that the State Department is closely monitoring infringements on the interests of the American people. The U.S. government habitually pays attention only to the interests of its own people and intends to continue to adopt an independent policy. (3rd Associated Press Dispatch)

(London) A British government spokesman told reporters yesterday that the anti-British movement promoted by Japan in the occupied areas has undermined the Arita-Craigie Agreement. As for whether the Japanese side deliberately undermined this Anglo-Japanese plan or was unable to fulfill the conditions of understanding, it is still difficult to know for the time being. Japanese Foreign Ministry officials may be willing to fulfill their obligations under the agreement, but it is also possible that the Japanese military authorities in China will still pursue their independent policy and intensify anti-British activities. The authorities of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are still exchanging views on the Far East issue. Britain's attitude towards the Tianjin silver issue is becoming more rigid, and it firmly rejects Japan's demands for legal tender. It is said that the British cabinet considered whether Britain should abolish the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation if the current Tokyo negotiations fail. Britain is now planning to extend the period of the Tokyo negotiations as much as possible. It is also heard that the British cabinet was quite encouraged by Canada's support for abolishing the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, but Australia and India are not enthusiastic about abolishing it due to the large amount of cotton and woolen textiles they export to Japan. At the same time, the British government received reliable information that Japanese military leaders were greatly discouraged by the instability of the situation in China and the possibility of a joint Anglo-American ban on the export of arms to Japan. (3rd Associated Press Dispatch)

(London) Lord Snell, leader of the opposition in the House of Lords, today, at the beginning of the foreign policy debate, asked Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax to explain the Tokyo plan and to guarantee that the government would not change its policy toward China and would continue to support Chinese legal tender. Lord Snell declared that Prime Minister Chamberlain seemed to be irritated and impatient with members who were seeking information. Members of Parliament were working somewhat in the dark, and had to read the newspapers to know everything, except for the meager news they received from the government, which was close to being obnoxious.

Editorial

### On Natural Thrift

To still lavishly discuss enjoyment today is, in terms of insight, truly on par with "Why not eat meat porridge?". If we consider the July price increases alone, the number of businesses that have published notices of price increases has already reached 152, and the number that have followed the general market trend without public announcement is unknown. The number of advertisements for price increases on August 1 alone exceeded ten, and the upward trend is still in full swing. As a result, Shanghai residents fear that food will not be available, and are burdened by the "seven necessities of life". With the exception of a very small number of wealthy people who are well-off and those who have become rich through speculation, most feel pain and are deeply concerned that the future is long, prices will rise endlessly, and they will not be able to bear the burden of supporting their elders and raising their young. However, observing their living conditions, they are still accustomed to extravagance and compete in luxury, disregarding the value of thrift and simplicity, and only worrying about high prices and the difficulty of making a living. This is quite contradictory!

The national crisis has reached this point, it is extremely serious. Life has reached this point, it is extremely difficult. Encountering national crisis and hardship in life is certainly reasonable and what we should expect, because national affairs are much more important than life. Moreover, the so-called difficulties today do not yet mean going hungry and not having clothes to cover the body. During the European War, Germany's supplies were cut off, and bread was distributed based on head count, calculated to the last gram. Those with large appetites had barely enough to eat. Furthermore, due to the scarcity of cotton, all cotton bedding and clothing were requisitioned by the government to make ammunition, and paper products were used as substitutes. Other daily necessities were impossible to purchase, yet the people remained calm. This was due to the war, but in peacetime, during the Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan, food was also distributed based on head count. Apart from what was necessary for life, all other items for enjoyment were used for export to obtain cash. The people suffered hardships but ultimately built up the country. If Shanghai residents think of this, they will find comfort in their current difficulties. Moreover, war is a calamitous event, as the ancients clearly taught. Therefore, a country does not lightly resort to arms unless absolutely necessary. China's resistance war was forced upon it. Victory would wipe out years of national humiliation and establish the foundation for rejuvenation, and the future happiness of the people would be boundless. Defeat would plunge future generations into an irrecoverable abyss, let alone personal property. Now that final victory is assured, what is there to worry about with temporary difficulties?

Even in terms of common sense, hardship can build a nation, while ease and comfort can destroy it. Wealth is not to be relied upon. Kou Zhun's achievements were brilliant and surpassed his contemporaries, but his descendants were impoverished because he lived lavishly. This serves as a warning. Therefore, the world's cycles of wealth and poverty, with the rich becoming poor and the poor becoming rich, are like nature evening out wealth and poverty, and adjusting fullness and emptiness. Yet, people do not understand that this is the inevitable consequence of arrogance and extravagance versus diligence and thrift. Now prices have risen again and again. Most people in Shanghai will be forced to move towards thrift. This forced thrift can also be said to be the result of natural thrift, not because they have realized the impropriety of arrogance, extravagance, and licentiousness. Those who are rich continue to spend as usual, so their consumption is even greater. Those in the middle class do not change their lifestyle, so their financial difficulties are even deeper. In order to continue their lives, they have no choice but to do so. Because of this, their thrift is difficult to sustain, and old habits return once the situation passes. We do not expect everyone to practice thrift strictly. It is commendable to keep to one's place and not go too far. In today's world, those who aspire to the Way and are not ashamed of wearing coarse clothes and eating simple meals will be seen as pedantic. Therefore, there are those who are unwilling to humble themselves for the sake of life and claim to be wise men of the times. From this, we can see the evils of luxury. Becoming accustomed to wrong and turning it into right, accumulating dirt and filth, destroying reason, obscuring it with private desires, not caring about ourselves, let alone our descendants, how can we still love our family and country?

However, Confucius said, "Wealth and rank are what men desire, but if they cannot be obtained in the right way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike, but if they cannot be avoided in the right way, they should not be abandoned." It can be seen that the ancients still had a sense of proportion in their choices between poverty, wealth, rank, and lowliness. This natural measure of proportion lies within the mind! We are unfortunate to live in this time of great tribulation, but we are also fortunate to have tasted suffering and experienced the world, so that our will is strengthened and our actions are more outstanding. This is an opportunity given to us by Heaven to temper ourselves. How can we forget our responsibilities, indulge in pleasure, and wallow in wine and women, thinking that life is for enjoyment? The individual's enjoyment should indeed be like this. Recently, Shanghai's foreign exchange has plummeted and prices have soared. Tracing the cause, it may not be unrelated to the extravagance of Shanghai people. What is the blame of legal tender? If Shanghai people can understand the difficulties of the country, abandon extravagance, and practice thrift, then today's life may not necessarily be so difficult.

Heaven helps those who help themselves. Those who hope to get help from others should also do their best to help themselves. Otherwise, people will see us as a nation of laziness, indolence, and pleasure-seeking, without perseverance and determination. How can we survive in the world? Therefore, simplicity can clarify one's ambition, and tranquility can lead to distance. If we can practice thrift and restore the inherent virtue of thrift of the Chinese nation, I cannot help but look forward to it!

### The Issue of Legal Tender Stability: Britain Proposes Revised Measures, All Banks Are Willing to Replenish Funds, But Only to the Extent of Balancing Imports and Exports

(London) British banks previously involved in the organization of the £10 million Chinese currency equalization fund have not yet been contacted by the government regarding the continued supply of funds, but it is heard that the banks are very willing to do so, provided that the Treasury continues to provide guarantees. The current status of the original equalization fund is extremely difficult to estimate, but it is said that a great deal has already been used. According to London sources, if the equalization fund is replenished, its methods must be modified somewhat. It is heard that some have used the equalization fund as a means of facilitating the escape of Chinese funds, and this must be stopped. Hereafter, the fund should only be used to maintain an appropriate average of imports and exports. This matter may be in progress, and any negotiations regarding replenishing the equalization fund are not within the scope of the banks. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

(London) The newspapers here are still paying close attention to the situation in the Far East. The intensity of the anti-British movement in the Japanese-occupied areas of China and the currency issue that has caused the Tokyo conference to stall are all regarded as extremely important by the newspapers. The House of Commons China Affairs Committee met last night and is said to have discussed the Chinese currency issue and the situation in North China in detail. It is heard that members of the House of Commons recently met with Prime Minister Chamberlain in a private capacity to state the absolute necessity of dealing with Japanese demands with a firm attitude. The Daily Telegraph today carried an article entitled "Japan's Strategy of Inducing Chinese Legal Tender to Commit Suicide," saying that Japan has failed to kill Chinese legal tender by its own methods and now has no choice but to hire others to do it. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

(London) The Financial News recently commented on the issue of Chinese legal tender, saying that Prime Minister Chamberlain's assurance that Britain's policy toward China will not change is encouraging, but it is still appropriate for the government to continue to take concrete actions to maintain Chinese legal tender. The stability of legal tender is not only appropriate for justice, but also related to British prestige, and is extremely important to our country's economic interests, which is undeniable. If we allow Japan to plunge China's currency system into collapse and forcibly establish a monetary fortress in China, attracting the country to join the Japanese yen group, then our country's trade with China will inevitably suffer a setback. Therefore, our country has sufficient reasons to maintain Chinese legal tender, but the price should not be too high. Judging from the current situation, the price may not be very high. What needs to be decided is what is the most advantageous way to protect it. This issue is quite complex. For the government, it only needs to grant China a huge amount of credit to alleviate the pressure on Chinese legal tender. In addition, Japan's demand for the transfer of silver deposits in Tianjin should be firmly rejected, and Japan should not be assisted in driving legal tender out of North China, because helping Japan establish a puppet currency system is tantamount to suicide.

### Inside Japan, People's Livelihoods Are Hard, and Income Tax Must Be Increased

(Tokyo) In order to increase income tax by 500 million yen annually, the Japanese government has submitted a new income tax plan to the Tax Reform Administration Council, proposing to levy income tax according to the following four categories: (1) real estate and dividends, (2) commerce and profession, (3) earned income, salary and pension, (4) group income. Fixed deductions will be given according to the number of family members, but only those with income below 500 yen will be exempt from income tax. The standard rate of the new tax is 10% for the first category, 8.5% for the second category, 6% for the third category, and 8% for the fourth category. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers today continued to attack the U.S. government for abolishing the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun claimed that "not only must the cunning British be taught a lesson, but also countries that cause damage and are reckless must be taught the same lesson." The Miyako Shimbun said that "the U.S. must bear the responsibility for the current U.S.-Japan relations. The U.S. abolition of the 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has terminated the friendly relations between the U.S. and Japan. President Roosevelt has completely destroyed 28 years of U.S.-Japan friendship. If the U.S. insists on refusing to recognize the new order in Asia, we should regard the U.S. as our enemy." Japanese newspapers insisted that Japan could resist the U.S. ban on exporting war materials to Japan, and hinted that Japan was unwilling to test Japan's capabilities in this regard. At the same time, Japanese newspapers continued their fierce anti-British movement, blaming the unrest in China over the past two years mostly on Britain, saying that last year's attempt to assassinate senior officials of the "Provisional Government" in Peiping also originated in the British Concession in Tianjin.

### U.S. and Britain Protest to Japan Simultaneously, British Newspapers Say It Is Another Warning, Members of Parliament Question Again in the House of Commons, Navigation Issue in the Hongkou Concession

(London) The Daily Mail today published an editorial entitled "Another Warning," which stated that the U.S. and Britain now have a closer alliance to counter Japan's arrogant strategy in China. If it is hoped that the Tokyo Conference will continue to be effective, they must stop this strategy. Harsh words may impress Japanese politicians, but if Japanese military leaders in China are to understand, there may need to be further indications. It should be known that we and the U.S. both hold powerful economic weapons. In the first three months of 1939, Britain purchased nearly £2.5 million worth of Japanese goods, while selling only £300,000 worth to Japan. We have a great possibility of reversing this difference and putting Japan at a great disadvantage. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

(London) British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie protested to the Japanese government yesterday regarding the anti-British demonstrations in North China, and U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Japan Dooman also made representations regarding the anti-American incidents that have occurred recently in the Japanese occupied areas of China. This matter was recently commented on by the Daily Express, saying, "It is gratifying to see that the British government is following in the footsteps of the U.S. government by protesting to the Japanese government at the same time. Since our country has the same interests as the U.S. in the Far East, and our views are also the same, we should follow the same path as that country and use its methods and goals as a model." (2nd Havas Dispatch)

(London) Conservative Member of Parliament Morley asked in the House of Commons today about the outcome of discussions between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the local Japanese authorities regarding the recovery of the administrative rights over the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas. Prime Minister Hastings has prepared to contact the Japanese government on this matter. Undersecretary Butler replied that the discussions between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the authorities are still in progress and are said to have reached a compromise on certain measures. It seems that there is no need for the British government to take any action at this time. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Conservative Member of Parliament Major General Knox raised a question, saying that the government had instructed Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie on June 6 to make representations regarding Japan's restrictions on British commerce along the Yangtze River in China. It is not known whether any answer has been received. Foreign Office official Butler replied immediately. Knox then said, "Eight weeks have passed since the representations were made. Even if the Japanese government is habitually slow to respond, an answer should have been given within this period." Undersecretary Butler then replied again, "Eight weeks is ample time, and the nature of the issue is quite urgent. This is why the government has ordered Ambassador Craigie to continue to urge the Japanese government to give a reply immediately." At this point, Liberal Member of Parliament Mander also asked, "How much time did it take for the U.S. to protest to Japan and receive an answer?" Undersecretary Butler did not answer. (2nd Havas Dispatch)

(London) Conservative Member of Parliament Graham asked Colonial Secretary MacDonald in the House of Commons today whether the Japanese authorities' cutting off food supplies from various small ports on the mainland to Hong Kong had come to his attention. MacDonald replied that the Hong Kong government is closely monitoring the local food situation, and so far there is no need to take special steps to obtain supplies. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

### Japan Suffers Repeated Setbacks, Considers New Alliance with Germany and Italy, Army Authorities Met Yesterday to Discuss European Policy

(Tokyo) Yesterday afternoon, the Ministry of the Army and the General Staff held a joint meeting to discuss the intensification of anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States, the conflict on the Manchurian border, and the current situation of the Anglo-Japanese Round Table Conference. The Ministry of the Army's organ newspaper, Chishin Shimbun, claimed that the above events are all inseparably linked to Japan's European policy. It is now hoped that the Japanese government will quickly implement the previously established foundation. It is heard that yesterday afternoon's meeting decided that the Ministry of the Army should advocate further resolutions regarding Japan's European policy. This afternoon, the three giants of the Army, namely Chief of General Staff Prince Kan'in, Minister of the Army Itagaki, and Inspector General of Military Education Nishio, held a meeting. Chief of Staff Nakajima and Director of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau Machijiri also attended. The purpose of this meeting was to decide on the Army's attitude towards the new situation in Europe. If necessary, the Supreme Military Council will be convened. It is heard that today's afternoon meeting intends to allow the Army to state the wishes of the Army when the five cabinet members meet tomorrow to discuss Japan's European policy. Judging from the news that Ambassador to Italy Shiratori and Ambassador to Germany Oshima are currently meeting in Italy regarding this matter, the issue of Japan concluding a military alliance with Germany and Italy seems to be urged forward again. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

(Rome) Today's meeting of the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, the Ambassador to Germany, and their military attachés is considered to be of great significance by political circles. According to Italian sources familiar with the matter, the issue discussed by the two ambassadors is whether Japan should join the German-Italian military alliance, or how to use the results of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations to ask Italy and Germany to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. (3rd Associated Press Dispatch)

### Japanese Authorities in Tanggu Declare Protection of Foreign Lives and Property

(Peiping) Several examples have been found of direct intimidation of Chinese employees of British people in this city after a group believed to be an anti-British corps organised by the Japanese issued letters to said Chinese employees. Most of the Chinese people remain harmonious as usual, or are not concerned, this dispute is started by a small group of people who have the full support of Japanese newspapers, and most Chinese believe that the instigators are supported by the Japanese military authorities, so it is easy to form a serious situation, the British authorities are negotiating with the Japanese embassy because of the new anti-British demonstration actions, and urging the Japanese authorities not to forget their responsibility to maintain law and order in the joint control area, today Tianjin News said that the Japanese military commander in Tanggu announced that although the army will not interfere with the march and demonstration movement, it will protect the lives and property of foreigners, and the anti-British movement in the area has been slightly quelled. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

(Peiping) According to news here today, the Japanese-controlled Chinese newspapers have unanimously intensified their anti-British activities, and British residents in Shanxi are also being forced to leave the country. However, due to the disruption of railway traffic, some British missionaries are now gathering in Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan, waiting for trains to Peiping. At the same time, many Chinese servants employed in British homes here have also left. (3rd Associated Press Dispatch)

### Important Figure in Canada Advocates Severing Economic Ties with Japan; U.S. Senator Requests Hull to Advise Munitions Merchants Not to Support Japan

Ottawa, Canada - The leader of the New Democratic Party, and former envoy to the U.S., Mr. He Li-zhi, recently issued a declaration, urging the government to immediately sever economic ties with Japan, stating roughly: "No democratic nation has any reason to maintain friendly relations with fascist Japan in any way. The United States has already acknowledged this by abolishing the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. For Canada's sake, and for the sake of our duty to the British Empire and neighboring United States, we should also sever economic ties with Japan. Since Canada and the United States share a common border, we should adopt a common policy towards Japan with the United States." (2nd Reuters dispatch from Ottawa)

(Washington) - Senator Schwellenbach, a Democrat from Washington State, recently stated in a speech to the Senate, "I have requested Secretary of State Hull to advise our nation's munitions exporters to no longer support Japan. Japan's needs for copper, steel, iron, and machinery are almost entirely supplied by the United States. Secretary of State Hull made a similar request to aircraft manufacturers last June, which proved effective. If this request is adopted, the shipment of U.S. munitions to Japan could be reduced by half or even two-thirds. When the Sino-Japanese war first began, I introduced a bill advocating for the prohibition of scrap iron shipments to Japan. Unexpectedly, parties involved in the scrap iron export industry protested vehemently. Now, these same parties no longer oppose the same bill." (2nd Havas dispatch)

### British Celebrated Author H.G. Wells Predicts Japanese Crisis Similar to Russia in 1918; Defeated Troops Returning Home Will Disadvantage Aristocrats and Wealthy Gentry

(London) - The celebrated author H.G. Wells published an article in the Daily Herald, predicting the future of the Far East, stating that Japan currently possesses the same factors as Russia in 1918, namely the factor of brutal rebellion. Nothing poses a greater threat to the government than the return of defeated troops. Aristocrats, wealthy gentry, and monks will all be disadvantaged. Japan will reshape its social and economic life, though its starting point may be lower than Russia's. The main forces in China today are communism and the New Life Movement. These two can resist external humiliation, but may not truly merge. Once China is liberated, it will become a battleground for the world's idealists. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

### Kunming Begins Controlling Prices

Kunming - Kunming began implementing a price control system this week in an effort to curb illegal profiteering. The provincial government has ordered shopkeepers to prepare price lists for inspection by police officers, who must be satisfied that the prices are reasonable. The provincial government's implementation of this measure has already led to a slight drop in the value of major commodities in recent days. For example, the current price of rice is 30 yuan per stone, compared to 33 yuan a few days ago. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Nationalist Chinese troops have been placed on high alert. (3rd dispatch)

(Luoyang) - The situation in Southern Henan is most intense on the western front of Xinyang. The Japanese troops in Huaihedian (east of Yuehedian) have been actively forcing laborers to repair roads in recent days. On the 1st, Nationalist Chinese troops ambushed from the front and both sides of the north, resulting in heavy Japanese casualties and a collapse. The Japanese troops retreated towards Xiaolindian (east of Huaihedian) and Tianhekou City, and Nationalist Chinese troops are pursuing them. Nationalist Chinese troops advancing on Minggang, on the 2nd, advanced to the vicinity of Minggang Station and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese. One part of the Japanese army retreated to the south, while the other part continued to stubbornly resist. Nationalist Chinese troops are vigorously attacking the Japanese. (3rd dispatch)

(Luoyang) - According to people who arrived from the front, the Japanese troops in Yangcheng were bombed by the Nationalist Chinese air force, and there are rumors that the Japanese commander, Lieutenant General Ushijima Kietsu, was killed in the bombing. Furthermore, continuous torrential rains have caused flooding in Yangcheng, resulting in heavy losses for the Japanese and widespread panic. (3rd dispatch)

(Xi'an) - Military intelligence indicates that the Japanese troops in Huaihedian, east of Tongbai, were severely attacked by Nationalist Chinese troops, resulting in heavy casualties. On the morning of the 1st, they collapsed and retreated in two directions: one towards Tianhekou (south of Tongbai) and the other towards Xiaolindian (east of Huaihedian). Nationalist Chinese cavalry immediately recovered the area and are currently pursuing the retreating Japanese. (3rd dispatch)

(Chongqing) - The Nationalist Chinese frontline military intelligence reports the following battle situation: Nationalist Chinese troops in Hubei are currently attacking Qianjiang on the southwest bank of the Han River. Nationalist Chinese troops in northern Hubei are blocking the Japanese troops advancing south of Tongbai amidst severe flooding.

On the morning of the 31st, Japanese troops from Luohan Temple used over ten mountain guns to continuously bombard the area between Shayang and Caobali, but without success. (3rd dispatch)

(Chongqing) - According to Chinese military experts today, the Japanese army's five-pronged attack on the Taihang Mountains in Shanxi last month is destined to fail. At present, the strength of the attacking Japanese troops has been almost completely exhausted. Although the outer strongholds of Nationalist Chinese forces in the Taihang Mountains were temporarily abandoned under the fierce attack of the Japanese army, once the Japanese army penetrated slightly deeper, the Nationalist Chinese forces immediately used extremely swift actions to attack their weak flanks. In the recent counter-offensive by the Nationalist Chinese forces in the area, ten important locations that had been lost previously have been recaptured, such as Yushe, Heshun, Yangcheng, Dongfeng, and Qinshui. At the same time, the Japanese troops in the Taihang Mountains area have become isolated units, lacking contact with each other. They have been feeling great difficulty in terms of military replenishment and the supply of food and military fire, because their communication lines to the north and west have now been cut off by the Nationalist Chinese forces. At the same time, the sudden rise of Qinshui and the floods in other parts of North China have also greatly hindered the Japanese military operations and reinforcement supplements.

### Rumors of Japanese Intention to Open the Pearl River

(Tokyo) - Rear Admiral Kanazawa, Director of the Information Bureau of the Japanese Navy, stated today that the Japanese government is planning to abandon the blockade of the Pearl River and allow foreign vessels to navigate the Pearl River again. According to Kanazawa, the Japanese army's declaration of the blockade of the Pearl River was originally for military operations. This operation has now been implemented according to plan, so it is possible to open it. There are two conditions that must be attached. First, foreign vessels can only transport necessities for foreigners for the use of foreigners living in Guangdong. Second, if there are new military operations, the military will be able to redeclare the blockade at any time. (3rd Haidong News Agency dispatch)

### Ministry of Education Dispatches Personnel to Inspect the Southwest

### Chongqing Attacked Again at Night; Nationalist Chinese Planes Take to the Air to Respond

(Chongqing) - Multiple Japanese planes invaded in several batches. Bombs mostly fell in desolate suburbs with little damage. Two batches of Japanese planes, totaling eighteen, attacked Chongqing again on the night of the 2nd. The first batch of nine planes infiltrated the city's airspace, but under close surveillance by Nationalist Chinese air defense forces, the Japanese planes were unable to aim accurately and blindly dropped bombs from high altitude before escaping eastward. The second batch of nine planes infiltrated the eastern suburbs of the city and escaped after dropping bombs. According to post-incident investigations, the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes in various places mostly fell in the desolate suburbs, and there was little loss on the Chinese side. (3rd dispatch)

(Chongqing) - Japanese bombers bombed Chongqing again last night. Because the moonlight was clear, the Japanese planes, in batches of nine, concentrated on bombing the western suburbs, but according to the investigation, the damage was extremely minor. (3rd Haidong News Agency dispatch)

(Chongqing) - When twenty-seven Japanese planes came to bomb last night, they were unable to wreak havoc due to the proper use of searchlights and the fierce firepower of the anti-aircraft guns. When the Japanese planes came, although they were divided into three teams, with nine planes in each team, they were unable to drop bombs in any of the teams and escaped immediately. Only the Chengdu Highway was slightly damaged. In addition to the fierce bombardment of the anti-aircraft guns, six Nationalist Chinese planes took to the air to intercept the Japanese planes. The moon was bright and clear when the Japanese planes attacked, and the targets of the anti-aircraft guns were extremely clear, so they could exert great power. The Japanese planes could only fly in the air. The first batch of nine Japanese planes appeared at 11:10 p.m., but they did not reach the air above the city and hurriedly dropped several bombs in the northern suburbs before escaping. The second team of nine planes appeared at 11:25 p.m. After dropping several bombs in the western suburbs, they circled the city and flew north. At that time, they were chased by Chinese fighter planes. The third team of nine planes appeared at 11:50 p.m. and dropped more than 30 bombs in the Jialing River and Yangtze River areas in the northern suburbs, but did not hit any important targets, so the Chinese side suffered almost no losses in the three air raids. Also, the Japanese air raid was first infiltrated by reconnaissance planes, the purpose of which was to attract Chinese fighter planes away, so that their bombing would not be hindered by Chinese fighter planes, and they could calmly engage in bombing. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)

(Chongqing) - During the Japanese air raid on Chongqing last night, more than 100 villagers on the mountainside north of the Yangtze River and in the western suburbs were killed or injured. The Japanese planes came in two waves. The first wave totaled 18 or more planes and appeared over Chongqing at 11:30 p.m. The anti-aircraft artillery did not open fire to allow Nationalist Chinese planes to intercept freely. An hour later, a second batch of nine Japanese planes attacked, but did not fly over Chongqing, heavily bombing the commercial airfield 25 miles downstream of Chongqing on the south bank of the Yangtze River before flying back downstream. The sound of the explosions was faintly audible here. The airfield is currently used by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Eurasia Aviation Corporation. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

(Chongqing) - A team of Japanese bombers, estimated by Chinese officials to number 18 or more, attacked last night, appearing in the sky at 11:30 p.m. and dropping bombs on the western suburbs. According to Chinese reports, there was no damage or fire. It was reported that Japanese planes dropped bombs along the Chongqing-Chengdu Highway, but most of them fell to the side. A part of the Japanese planes bombed a point 25 miles downstream of Chongqing. The sound of the explosions was slightly audible here. Nationalist Chinese fighter planes repeatedly attacked Japanese planes. Anti-aircraft guns did not open fire to allow Nationalist Chinese fighter planes to intercept freely. The all-clear was sounded at 12:30 a.m. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

(Hong Kong) - According to reports from Chongqing, Japanese air force bombed Chongqing again on the night of the 2nd. In total, this air raid was the eleventh. Taking advantage of the bright moonlight, they divided into two large teams and dropped huge amounts of bombs amidst Nationalist Chinese artillery fire. (3rd Allied Press dispatch)

### Residents of Tianjin Concessions Suffer Greatly

Tightened Blockade Makes Finding Food Difficult; Continuous Heavy Rain Causes Flood Worries

(Tianjin) - Restrictions on passage in the Tianjin concessions have been tightened since yesterday afternoon, especially regarding various foods. Milk shops have been notified that the amount of milk they can bring into the concession each day must not exceed 100 bottles. Since the blockade of the concessions, some foreigners have braved the long journey to purchase goods in the Special District 1 due to the lower prices there, but now each person is only allowed to bring a very small amount of food back into the concession. The restrictions are so strict that they are often insufficient for the daily needs of a family of several people, and all packages must be thoroughly inspected, which takes a long time. The stalls in the British concession's vegetable market are suddenly empty, and the few remaining vegetables are rotten. The stallholders are all pessimistic about the future. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

(Tianjin) - Tianjin residents have already suffered greatly due to the hot weather and the blockade of the concessions, and now there is the threat of flooding. This is because there have been continuous heavy rains in the suburbs of Tianjin, and there are several breaches in the Yongding River, causing the flow of the Hai River to become a torrent. Currently, the water level of the Hai River downstream of the British concession is three feet from the shore, and the situation in the Special District 3 is similar. It is hoped that the heavy rains will stop so that Tianjin can avoid another flood. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

(Tianjin) - The supply of vegetables to the British and French concessions here is almost zero today. One reason is the restrictions on import by the Japanese, and the other is that the rising waters of the Hai River have flooded many farmlands. Therefore, very few vegetables can be transported to Tianjin. Also, several White Russians carrying a large amount of food attempted to bring it into the British concession today, but were blocked by the Japanese and were unable to enter the concession.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Zhangzhou

(Xiamen) - An unspecified number of Japanese naval aircraft bombed Nationalist Chinese military positions in Zhangzhou, west of Xiamen, from the morning to the afternoon of the 2nd. (2nd Allied dispatch)

Shaoguan - Eighteen Japanese planes, in two batches, invaded Guangdong Province at 9 a.m. on the 3rd. Twelve planes reconnoitered in the area of Yingde and Wengyuan, and six planes broke into Shaoguan, dropping over a hundred bombs in a certain village in the suburbs. Because a Japanese plane had circled and reconnoitered over the village on the 2nd, the villagers had all moved away the previous morning, so only a dozen houses were burned down. (3rd dispatch)

### Japanese Again Claim Chinese Soldiers Borrow Foreign Flags

(Tokyo) - A Navy spokesman declared today that Japanese pilots have now discovered another case of Chinese soldiers misusing foreign flags. On July 30, Japanese aircraft saw many Chinese trucks carrying military fire traveling between Nanning and Binyang. The Japanese aircraft did not attack because they saw British flags on the trucks. According to the pilot's report, the Chinese soldiers apparently used British flags to avoid Japanese aircraft attacks. If this is the case, the Japanese Navy aircraft will not be responsible for any unfortunate incidents that may occur in the future. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

### Large Increase in Japanese Troops in Inner Mongolia; Military Vehicles on PingSui Line Continuously Heading West; Also Moving Towards Dolonnur

(Beiping) - According to the Associated Press, reliable sources have learned that the Japanese army in Inner Mongolia is now greatly increasing. Before the PingSui line was blocked by floods, military vehicles carrying troops and weapons would head west every day. The garrison in Baotou has also seen a large increase. At the same time, the Japanese army on this line and the Inner Mongolian army driven by the Japanese army also appear to be moving towards Dolonnur, which is located in the border area between Inner and Outer Mongolia. This action by the Japanese is a preventive measure to prevent the escalation of conflicts on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia border. At the same time, the Japanese are also building a railway north of Dolonnur. However, it is not known for sure whether the Japanese troops transferred there are fresh troops dispatched by Japan or exhausted troops transferred from China. Also, according to a Japanese army spokesman, near Baoding, the Japanese army attacked 100 Chinese guerrillas, forcing them to retreat. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)

### Chongqing Public Organizations Telegraph British Ambassador, Requesting a Halt to Negotiations with Japan, Claiming a Difficult Result

(Chongqing) - Representatives from the Chongqing City Council Chairman, Chamber of Commerce Chairman, Chongqing University President, Chongqing Trade Union Chairman, and Chongqing Women's Association, jointly telegraphed British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr today, expressing the Chinese public's disappointment with the UK-Japan settlement, and requesting him to convey to the British government a suspension of the Tokyo negotiations. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

(Chongqing) - Representatives from the local Chamber of Commerce, Municipal Advisory Committee, Trade Union, Women's Association, and Youth Association have all telegraphed British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. The telegram expresses disappointment with the initial UK-Japan agreement, and then requests that the UK end the UK-Japan Tokyo negotiations, because further negotiations will only further damage Britain's international prestige and have no benefit. Moreover, China's current war of resistance is not only for itself, but also for the dignity of international treaties, such as the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations Covenant. Since the UK is a signatory to these two treaties, it should do its best to assist China. In addition, Japan has never been sincere in negotiations. What will be the result of many negotiations? Therefore, the UK should not be deceived by Japan and should quickly stop the negotiations. The telegram concludes by stating that the Chinese people firmly believe that the UK will maintain its traditional policy of friendship with China, and China will also be grateful for the UK's friendly assistance. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)

(Chongqing) - The Chongqing United Daily News editorial today expressed confidence that the British government would not change its policy in China, and expressed appreciation for the general British public opinion expressed in newspaper commentaries and House of Commons questions which expressed support for assisting China and adopting a strong Far East policy. It stated that what we hope for is that the British government can find a way to stop Japan's aggression and assist China. As for what action the British government will take, or whether the UK will take the same action with other countries, it is not something we want to interfere with. We only want to see the UK act in accordance with its words. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

### Optimistic Outlook on British, French, and Soviet Negotiations; Substantial Progress Made on the Definition of "Indirect Aggression"

Soviet Union Insists on Simultaneous Establishment of Two Agreements

(London) - Regarding the progress of the British, French, and Soviet negotiations, sources close to the government here recently stated that after today's talks between the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and the British and French ambassadors, substantial progress has been made on the definition of "indirect aggression." Regarding this, the British plan, while avoiding interference in the internal affairs of the Baltic states, has made appropriate arrangements to deal with the crisis posed by the formation of National Socialist governments in those countries. This plan is under discussion and the outlook is very optimistic. It is hoped that Prime Minister Chamberlain will report on the progress of the Moscow negotiations before the adjournment of Parliament on the 4th of this month. However, Soviet sources here are very reserved, still insisting that the military agreement and the political agreement should be established simultaneously. If the talks between the British, French, and Soviet staff officers have been delayed for four or five weeks, then the tripartite political agreement may be delayed for several weeks before it can be established. (2nd Havas dispatch)

(3rd Havas dispatch)

(Paris) - The French military commission to Moscow for staff talks will depart on Friday, first going to London to meet with the British military commission. The two delegations plan to travel together to Moscow on Saturday. The British delegation includes Major General C.

### British Foreign Secretary Meets with Polish Ambassador to Discuss Polish-German Relations; German Suggestion of Eastern European Pact Denied Firmly by British Officials

(London) - Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Polish Ambassador Raczyński this afternoon to discuss relations between Poland and Germany, as well as the general situation in Europe. Regarding the issue of the Free City of Danzig, it was rumored here yesterday afternoon that Germany had issued a note advocating that Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Poland hold a meeting to decide to merge the city into Germany, and then conclude an Eastern European Locarno Pact to stabilize the situation in Eastern Europe. People in the Congress heard about it and discussed it. The official side firmly denied it, saying that this was Germany's strategy, intending to test the reactions of Britain and Poland. However, Britain has an obligation to guarantee Poland, and once Poland believes that its vital interests are threatened, it should come out to assist without hesitation. On the Polish side, it was said that the rumor that the Polish government intended to give up the city of Danzig and use the division of Slovakia with Germany as an exchange condition was all unfounded. What Germany covets is named the city of Danzig, but in reality, it is the Polish Corridor and Silesia Province, which is also well known to Poland. (2nd Havas dispatch)

### German Navy Holds Demonstration in Danzig

Danzig: The German Naval Association held a demonstration rally here last night. The leader of the Danzig branch of the German Naval Association, Rossger, gave a speech first, stating that the plan for this rally had been planned for a long time and was not a counter-demonstration against Poland's recent "Navy Day". He continued that the president of the German Naval Association, namely the former Chief of Staff of the German High Seas Fleet, has no political significance. Subsequently, Mr. Te delivered a speech, saying, "Anyone who discusses the strength of the German Navy must mention Danzig, because Danzig is the birthplace of the Prussian and German Navies." (Haitong Telegram, 3rd)

### Poland Closely Monitoring the Situation in Danzig

Warsaw: Polish authorities are currently closely monitoring the movement in Danzig to use economic methods to incorporate the Free City into Germany. It is generally believed that the uproar caused by Poland's withdrawal of customs inspectors from the butter factory and restrictions on fish imports into Danzig are of great significance. Polish sources pointed out that any attempt to open the customs border adjacent to East Prussia, which some parties in Danzig have already threatened, is a unilateral change in the status of the Free City and is unacceptable to Poland. Local newspapers declared that retaliation is unnecessary, as Poland took action because of Danzig's treatment of Polish customs officials. The newspapers also emphasized that repeated protests have been in vain. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)

### Italy Hopes Danzig Problem Will Be Resolved Peacefully

(Rome) The relevant authorities here expect the European situation to become serious in early September, at which time the Danzig Free City problem will have reached maturity. The German National Socialist Party will inevitably discuss it at the annual conference in Nuremberg. In this way, the European situation will be similar to the tension surrounding the Czech problem in September last year, but it will not lead to war. It is also possible to establish a compromise solution to the Danzig problem, so that Germany's self-esteem is satisfied and the status quo is maintained for a certain period of time. Although this is a temporary measure, it allows Germany and Italy to wait for a better opportunity to satisfy all their wishes and should not be immediately taken as consolation. The Italian side is able to consider the recent developments in the international situation, and obviously does not want to act rashly, such as Germany's resurgence of national power, the close cooperation between Britain and France to resist aggression, the active expansion of armaments by Britain and France, Poland's determination to safeguard its vital rights, the close relationship between Turkey, Greece, Romania, and various democracies, and the Egyptian government's decision to add air force bases to prevent attacks by Italian Libyan troops, and the dispatch of military delegations by Britain and France to Moscow. In view of this situation, the Italian government has agreed to establish a compromise solution for the Danzig issue, while waiting for a good opportunity for Germany and Italy to carry out the entire plan together.

### British House of Commons Passes Motion to Adjourn After Heated Debate

—Adjourned from August 4th to September 3rd—

Opposition Labour Party Proposes Amendment; British Prime Minister Considers it Disguised No-Confidence

(London) The government today moved that the House of Commons should adjourn from August 4th to September 3rd. Opposition Labour Party leader Greenwood immediately proposed an amendment, arguing that Parliament should reconvene on August 21st. Liberal Party leader Sinclair and Conservative Party leader Churchill both spoke in support of the amendment, but the amendment was ultimately defeated by 250 votes to 132, while the government motion proposed by Prime Minister Chamberlain was passed by 245 votes to 129. The Prime Minister pointed out that the opposition party's amendment was a disguised no-confidence vote, but the Prime Minister promised to convene Parliament if there was a sudden change in the European situation.

Chamberlain Explains Reasons for Motion

When the Prime Minister put forward the motion to adjourn, he declared that the date of this adjournment was shorter than usual, because the normal business of this session was delayed by urgent legislation. He meant that Parliament had dealt with all the necessary legislation for the time being, so the House of Commons could ensure that the country was now prepared to deal with sudden changes. Now there are at least two reasons why the government can reconvene Parliament during the adjournment if it feels necessary: ​​one is that if the government feels it is necessary, it must ask the House of Commons to pass the legislation currently being discussed; the other is that if the government wants to ask the House of Commons to pass the plans it has taken or will take to deal with unexpected situations. The adjournment motion also contains a clause stipulating that if the Speaker considers it in the public interest to reconvene early, it can be done.

Opposition Party Worries About Second Munich

After the Prime Minister finished speaking, Labour Party leader Greenwood put forward an amendment, arguing that the House of Commons should reconvene on August 21st, because of the dangerous international situation. Greenwood also said that in addition to this feeling of fear, he also suspected that once the House of Commons adjourns, the government may make a wrong turn. If the people know that the National Assembly will reconvene in three weeks, their spirits will be greatly boosted and their confidence will be strengthened. Now, if a German is shot in Danzig, the world will enter a great war within 24 hours. In addition, the issue of the alliance between France, the Soviet Union, and Britain has not yet been resolved. After the adjournment of the National Assembly, how can we know that the government will not slack off on this matter? Here, he did not mean that the government had this intention, but that the government might inevitably take this path. As for the situation in the Far East, how can the opposition party know that it will not create a second Munich? Greenwood said urgently that the House of Commons should convene until the Moscow agreement is in hand. Greenwood also asked, if Hitler focuses on Yugoslavia, how will we deal with it? According to the information he has obtained, the situation in Yugoslavia may easily become another crisis in Europe.

Sinclair Supports Greenwood's Motion

Sir Sinclair spoke in support of Greenwood's motion, adjusting the Prime Minister's recent guarantee that the government will not make a major departure from its announced policies. However, his words have not been implemented in one place. May I ask if the meeting in Berchtesgaden has ever deviated from the announced policy? The decision there led Hitler to Prague. Now what I want to know is whether the House of Commons will have the opportunity to discuss publicly before the government makes major decisions such as Berchtesgaden?

Churchill Points Out Seriousness of Situation

Churchill then spoke to discuss the government's motion, saying that the government is safer when the House of Commons is in session. It would be regrettable if the situation became more serious and the House of Commons could not do anything. Churchill asked if anyone doubted that the highest test of determination will be made from now on, even if the highest test of force is not made. The House of Commons is currently an effective factor. It is harmful, pathetic, and shameful to act casually now. He firmly believes in the Prime Minister's loyalty, but his decisions may be different from others. Reconvening Parliament will indicate the extreme urgency of the situation, because the entire fleet has now been mobilized. This can also show that something important is happening and make Britain make a serious resolution to resist. He believes that the situation in Europe at this time is more critical than at this time last year, which can be seen from the fact that Germany now has a large number of soldiers waiting with their weapons. The German army has gathered heavily along the Polish border and has made various preparations for a rapid advance. All of this should be paid attention to.

Chamberlain Refutes the Opposition's Arguments

When the Prime Minister spoke to refute this amendment, he mentioned that the Labour Party spokesperson suggested that Parliament should continue to convene for three weeks, at which time Britain could reach a compromise with the Soviet Union, saying that there were several warning phrases in the communique issued by Moscow. In the opinion of the government, it is best not to be too optimistic about ending these negotiations in a very short period of time. As for the arguments put forward by Churchill, they are all based on the serious nature of the situation. These arguments must inevitably lead people to the conclusion that the House of Commons should never adjourn. The Prime Minister then answered the argument that the danger of war could be reduced when the House of Commons was in session, recalling that the House of Commons was in session when the Austrian atrocity occurred, but it was still unable to find a way to stop it. On March 15th, when the German army began to advance towards Prague, the House of Commons held a debate in the afternoon, but there was no way to stop it. The Prime Minister said that the opposition party's amendment was self-contradictory, lacked a logical basis, and was a disguised no-confidence vote. He hoped that the House of Commons would reject it. Several members asked the Prime Minister to make some concessions for the sake of national unity. The Prime Minister then indicated in response to a certain question that Parliament would be reconvened if there was a sudden change in the European situation. As a result, the Labour Party's amendment was put to a vote and rejected by the public. The government's motion to adjourn was passed by a majority. The Prime Minister once considered this a vote of confidence in the government.

Many Conservative Party Members Abstain

(London) When the motion to adjourn Parliament was put to a vote in the House of Commons yesterday, more than 40 Conservative Party members of the government faction actually abstained. The political circles were shocked after hearing the news. Before the vote, Prime Minister Chamberlain had asked the government faction to support each member, saying, "If the House of Commons opposes the government's motion, it is a vote of no confidence in the government." The implication was, "Any member who does not vote in favor will be considered an opposition." However, in addition to the 25 far-rightists led by Churchill, more than a dozen Conservative Party members still abstained. Among them, Sir Roger Conant and Mr. Emery were the most well-known. Emery once served as Minister of the Colonies and was quite powerful in the party. Sir Roger Conant previously served as Prime Minister Chamberlain's private secretary from 1931 to 1936, and the Prime Minister was very dissatisfied with this. He has entrusted the leader of the government party to conduct an investigation to find out the reasons for these people's violation of party discipline and abstention. Regarding this level, political circles all said, "The government intends to re-elect the House of Commons in mid-November this year. It is worth noting that 40 Conservative Party members have expressed their opposition to the government at this time." (Havas Telegram, 3rd)

### Mussolini Inspects by Plane

Milan: Mussolini today flew his own plane to observe the start of the 150,000-strong Italian army participating in the exercise from the air. Mussolini then met with King Emmanuel near the exercise headquarters in Novara, Camarino Province. Then Mussolini flew back to Rimini, and the King inspected the line for a week. Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaeta, wrote an article in the Italian daily criticizing the exercise, saying that it boasted of defense and gap security across the Alps. Italy, like Germany, does not have such illusions and will find a way for its troops to break through them and restore freedom of military action. The exercises in the Po River basin are based on this possibility. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)

### Declaration Issued Praising German Strength

Today is the 25th anniversary of the outbreak of the European War. Commander-in-Chief of the Army General Walther von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Erich Raeder, and Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force General Hermann Göring have all issued declarations praising that today's Germany has extremely powerful military strength, which is more than that of 1914. General von Brauchitsch said, "If other countries order our country to resort to war, our country's army will deal with it with determination and courage, just like in 1914. To this day, Germany's strength has doubled compared to 1914. Based on the experience gained after the Great War, we deeply know that the enemy's resentment is very deep. We must strengthen ourselves to avoid being bullied. Führer Hitler has determined the political goals for which we must fight. Our country's political and military command has been unified. As a result, the military strength of our country's 80 million people will fight together in wartime, and we will obtain a guarantee for this." General Göring said, "The strength of the German Air Force is the best in the world and is prepared to carry out Führer Hitler's orders with lightning speed and unexpected power."

### Chinese Firecrackers Continue to Be Exported to the United States

(Washington Aviation Communication) The Bureau of Domestic and Foreign Trade recently issued statistics stating that last year, the United States imported firecrackers worth US$645,000, of which US$532,000 were imported from China. In 1937, the total import value was US$824,000, of which US$596,000 were imported from China. The comparison between the two shows that China's exports of firecrackers to the United States have not been seriously affected by the war. In 1937, there were 50 firecracker manufacturing factories in the United States, and their total output was worth US$3,160,000. It can be seen that imports from abroad only account for a very small part. These firecrackers are mostly set off on July 4th, the American Independence Day. (Havas News Agency)

### Anglo-Polish Relations and the Danzig Question

— Uncle Di

London Dispatch

British Prime Minister Chamberlain's diplomatic path and the methods of implementing it, to a purely objective person, seem disgusting, and if one were more relaxed, he might let out a cold laugh. But when we think that this concerns the future destiny of the whole world, and we are in it, then, for the most part, it will feel uncomfortable, and therefore feel that we must further endeavor from our own positions. In fact, even from the standpoint of pure British imperialist interests, Chamberlain's path and methods are still very dangerous. He is pushing the future of the British Empire step by step towards the edge of a cliff, seemingly unwilling to give up until he reaches his goal. This point is now felt by even those so-called "die-hard" figures in the British Conservative Party who are a little more clear-headed, and they have raised objections; and since opposition has been ineffective, they have given up on improving Chamberlain's policies. I have done a statistical analysis that, while not very precise, is generally accurate, and the results show that among the very few people in Britain who still support Chamberlain's policies, those who usually don't pay attention to international politics and are unclear-headed account for more than 80 percent; of the remaining two percent or so, the elderly (seventy years old is the minimum) account for half, and the other half are those with ulterior motives.

Everyone agrees that Britain currently has only three paths to take in order to maintain the survival of her future empire; one is that Britain, the United States, and France unite and stand on one line to form an alliance; if this is not possible, then the second is to bring the Soviet Union and all the small, safe, and threatened countries together to form a united front; if they are unwilling to take this path either, then there is only one second path left, which is to strengthen the ties between Britain, France, and those countries bordering the Soviet Union. That way, in the event of a conflict with Germany and Italy, it would make it completely impossible for the Soviet Union to stand idly by.

The reason why the establishment of the Anglo-Polish and Anglo-Turkish pacts successively caused Germany and Italy to be greatly surprised lies in this. Therefore, when Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck came to London during the Anglo-Polish pact negotiations, his arrogance can truly be described as "unparalleled." And in my opinion, the importance that the British side attached to his visit was not even exceeded by the "state visit" of the French President last year. Beck repeatedly and publicly said that the establishment of the Anglo-Polish pact was insignificant to Poland; its greatest benefit was to Britain. Later, when Halifax turned the British unilateral guarantee of Poland's security into a mutual assistance pact, it can truly be said that he expended great effort. The price paid, including loans, etc., although already considerably high, in the final analysis, is still considered a major diplomatic gain for Britain. Any observer would agree with this, right?

Then, should the current and future relationship between Britain and Poland be able to proceed completely smoothly? But in fact, it is not so.

Currently, there are two negotiations being held between Britain and Poland in order to further consolidate the alliance: one is the negotiation between the British and Polish General Staffs in Warsaw; the other is the loan negotiation being held in London. And the focus of the dispute between Britain and Poland, which makes it difficult for the above two meetings to achieve satisfactory results, is the so-called Danzig question.

Danzig is indeed a big problem at the moment. But it is only an international problem, not a problem between Germany and Poland over the dispute over Danzig itself. In other words, if Germany and Poland were to negotiate this issue directly, then a solution might be found immediately. But once it is placed in the international arena, its complexity immediately increases countless times.

Everyone knows that Strang, who is still stranded in Moscow, playing a key role for Britain in the Anglo-French-Soviet triangular negotiations, was in Warsaw more than a month ago, negotiating the Danzig issue with the Polish authorities. At that time, his task was to represent the British government and advise the Polish authorities to "peacefully" give up Danzig through British "mediation." This proposal was immediately rejected by Beck, and later, he even refused to discuss the Danzig issue with Strang again. In such a stalemate, Strang was suddenly recalled to his country, and then suddenly embarked on another journey to undertake a major task, flying to Moscow. Thus, the negotiations between Britain and Poland over Danzig were temporarily suspended.

Not long after this negotiation ended, a large number of German Nazis openly entered the Free City of Danzig, carrying artillery and machine guns. At the same time, a large number of German troops gathered on the border of German East Prussia. Indeed, according to various reliable news and symbolic inferences at the time, the purpose of this move by Germany was only to test the international reaction; its conspiracy to seize Danzig should have been no earlier than August, and the preparations at the time were not yet mature. Then, the Polish army also gathered, and its authorities declared that in the event that Germany seized Danzig, whether by "internal seizure" or "external aggression," Poland was prepared to immediately send troops into Danzig. At the same time, Poland notified Britain of this attitude.

As a result, Prime Minister Chamberlain really panicked for a moment; in a short period of time, the clouds of war in Europe seemed to have filled the entire space. Chamberlain was very afraid that Poland would really fight with Germany, dragging Britain and France into it. So he quickly sought Poland's opinion to see if there was still a way to reconcile. Poland's answer was a categorical "no!" Her authorities told the British authorities that if Germany occupied Danzig, Poland would consider that the situation had reached a point where there was absolutely no compromise or concession, that it had harmed "Poland's major interests" and affected "Poland's independence and survival," and that she believed that it was worth fighting for.

We must remember; Hitler's gamble on Danzig was based on the assumption that Britain would not care, that Britain would not be willing to fight for Danzig. Therefore, he calculated that by making such a show of force, either Poland would succumb under British pressure; or Britain, out of fear of being implicated, would alienate Poland, in this way, a big crack would appear in the Anglo-Polish mutual assistance pact.

At that time, people inside Britain fully understood Hitler's customary diplomatic tactics. So everyone unanimously pressured Prime Minister Chamberlain to quickly express Britain's attitude. But in fact, Prime Minister Chamberlain had already expressed his attitude more than once, that Britain was not only unwilling to fight for the Danzig issue, but also that if Hitler could compromise on other issues, Britain could even be confident of pressuring Poland to give up Danzig. Then, what else could be expressed? However, the pressure from the British public at the time was really too great, and even a stubborn person like Prime Minister Chamberlain could not but give in. However, on the eve of issuing the statement, he still finally advised Poland to consider: sending the original draft of the statement to Poland first to see. At this time, Poland's attitude was extremely stubborn, and she said to Britain; whether to issue a statement or not is Britain's own business, issue it or not, Poland leaves it to Britain to consider; but Poland wants to firmly tell Britain that if Germany occupies Danzig, Poland will definitely start military action, even if Britain and France stand idly by, Poland will not care.

What is said here is the famous declaration that Prime Minister Chamberlain finally issued, that Britain would do its utmost to support Poland's position on the Danzig issue. As soon as this declaration was issued, the clouds of war over Danzig immediately dispersed.

Here, we should note a very important point, which is; what Chamberlain feared most was, of course, that Germany and Poland would really fight, drawing Britain and France into the vortex; but what he feared even more severely was that Germany and Poland would completely collude with each other, keeping the Soviet Union out, and then Germany, Italy, and Poland would join together to demand that Britain and France divide the colonies equally.

This spring, Hitler said to Beck in person; Poland today is already a "first-class power," but like Germany and Italy, it lacks colonies, so it should also be listed among the "powers without colonies" and has the right to demand colonies and "living space" from Britain and France, but there is one big prerequisite, which is: first let Danzig merge into Germany.

Although the negotiations at that time did not achieve concrete results, the possibility of Germany and Poland reaching a compromise over Danzig always existed. Even after the establishment of the Anglo-Polish pact, Poland's diplomacy on the Danzig issue always had a dual nature. To Britain, Poland said that she would never give up Danzig, and was prepared to fight if necessary, with no room for discussion; but between Germany and Poland, negotiations to find a compromise solution to the Danzig issue never stopped for a day. What do these facts show? It shows that even if Poland were to give up Danzig, she would do so voluntarily in order to obtain a price, and would not allow Britain and France to do a favor and offer it to Germany; Poland, in view of the precedent of the Munich Conference, did not want to repeat the mistakes of Czechoslovakia.

This so-called Danzig issue, if it continues to ferment like this, will of course cause a "crisis" again. And Germany plans, in any case, to present it as one of this year's victorious gains at the Nuremberg Nazi Party Congress in September. Therefore, the period during which it can be stretched and maneuvered is really very short. Therefore, Britain and Poland quickly began negotiations between the General Staffs as soon as possible, and Anglo-Polish loan negotiations. These two negotiations were originally stipulated in the Anglo-Polish pact.

Regarding the former negotiation, the British military authorities strongly advocated an early result; but Poland's attitude was very cold, and she insisted on completing the loan negotiation first. However, British Prime Minister Chamberlain used the completion of the loan negotiation as a tool to force Poland to first agree to Britain's solution to the Danzig issue. Of course, Chamberlain still wanted to start negotiations with Germany again recently; then, the Danzig issue is again a great bargaining chip. However, so far, Poland still insists on absolutely rejecting Britain's intervention in the Danzig issue. Therefore, these two negotiations, which are being conducted at the same time, have both fallen into a semi-dead state.

Most people in Britain today oppose Chamberlain's approach. The major premise is that they believe that appeasement with Germany is getting worse and worse, and that if things continue like this, it will inevitably lead to war. The second is that they believe that Poland would rather fail to secure a loan than have Britain interfere in Danzig. Therefore, if the Anglo-Polish negotiations fail and Germany and Poland turn to approach each other successfully, then Britain's great disaster at that time will be unimaginable. France's attitude is also the same, so she not only urges Britain to complete the loan negotiations as soon as possible, but she is willing to fully fulfill her promise to Poland and lend 600 million francs to Poland first.

These days, Prime Minister Chamberlain has accomplished nothing and has been blamed by domestic and foreign sources, presenting a very annoyed state. He placed all the responsibility for the failure on the parliament and public opinion institutions. He said that if it were not for the constant questioning in the British Parliament and the extensive publication in newspapers and magazines, his secret diplomacy and special path could have been successful. Therefore, he is already planning what methods he can use to clamp down on public opinion, and he also plans to order cabinet members to avoid discussing international events as much as possible when answering questions in Parliament. But in a country like Britain with such a strong democratic atmosphere, all of this will of course be in vain and will instead become a laughing stock.

Soon, the period of the parliament's regular recess will arrive again. It is said that during this period, Chamberlain, holding great hope, plans to take the opportunity to try his great diplomatic strokes again. Let's wait and see. (July 21)

### A True Record of a Trip to the Southwest (Continued)

The passengers who traveled by ship from Hong Kong to Haiphong could get along well after two days of ephemeral life. Although they could not help each other much, they could still take care of each other. Therefore, before the ship arrived, everyone decided to form a small group to take care of each other when they encountered an inspection. After the scattered luggage was unloaded, the large luggage was handed over to the travel agency (because the Haiphong hotels were doing too well and there were no people soliciting customers on the ship). Firstly, the travel agency was more familiar with customs inspection procedures when picking up passengers, and most of them were Cantonese, so they could barely communicate in language. Secondly, having more people to take care of things would also help with sorting during the inspection. It is said that pickpockets are most numerous in the section from the ship to the customs warehouse (i.e., the place waiting for inspection). Therefore, after handing the luggage to the travel agency, the individual must still follow it. According to the previous rules, after the luggage and passengers entered the customs warehouse, the doors and windows were all closed, waiting quietly for the customs officers to inspect. Sometimes it did take more than one or two hours. If it was a hot day and you were locked in a house where you couldn't see your fingers, the suffering was really unbearable. Now the method has been changed so that the luggage of ships arriving in the morning is inspected after 2 p.m., and those arriving in the afternoon are inspected the next day. During the waiting period, the luggage is locked in the customs warehouse, and the passengers can move freely outside. During the inspection, there are many people and hands, and the situation is extremely chaotic. If one or two people are carrying many pieces of luggage, it is indeed not easy to take care of them, because each piece of luggage must be placed on the inspection table and opened. After opening, it is slightly turned over (most of them will not turn it over completely unless they intentionally want to make things difficult for you), and then you must leave the inspection table and move it out of the door. There is absolutely no time to sort it out calmly. At the same time, the shouts and urging make the passengers' emotions extremely chaotic, and the crooks take the opportunity to act. At this time, it is best to completely open the locks on all the luggage in the group, leave a part of the people to guard and wait for the inspection, and the rest of the people are divided into two groups, one group is responsible for transporting the scattered luggage to the outside of the customs warehouse, and the other group selects an open space outside the gate to be responsible for keeping the scattered luggage that is sent out. After everyone's luggage has been completely inspected, then start sorting it out. Generally, new goods that are not large in quantity (two or three pieces) will not be taxed. Matches are monopolized by the French government in Vietnam, so it is best not to bring them. If you bring them, they will at most be confiscated. Previously, there were occasional occurrences of fining one dollar for each match, but now they mostly just throw them into their specially prepared small drawers and that's it. If you encounter new goods that are large in quantity, the customs officer will put them aside. At this time, the people guarding and waiting for the inspection should pay special attention to the number of items and the location where they are placed, so that there is room for negotiation and return later. The chances of getting them back are high, but you must be good at explaining.

Finally, I would like to mention the situation of taxation. If you bring a dozen or a large quantity of new goods, it is still best to submit a declaration and pay taxes. According to the regulations of the Vietnamese Customs, national goods are subject to a transit tax of 1%, and Western goods are subject to 4%. However, if they are not directly transported from Chinese territory, they are all subject to a tax of 4%. At the same time, the items that passengers carry with them are now also allowed to be taxed at a uniform rate of only 1%. Previously, the Haiphong Chinese Consulate had a passenger guidance center that also acted as an agent for reporting customs affairs, but it has now been closed. Therefore, if you are carrying a large quantity of goods in transit, it is best to contact the visa office in Hong Kong first to avoid delaying your days in Haiphong. (To be continued)

### Chen Dongyuan, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, Talks About How to Choose Departments and Schools (Continued 4) Experience and Environment as Selection Criteria Are Indispensable Conditions, It Is Very Reasonable to Go to School and Find a Job According to Personal Interests

(2) Personal interests, because of individual differences, each person's interests in worldly things, whether academic or non-academic, are often not the same. It is certainly very reasonable to use interest as a standard for choosing university departments and lifelong careers. This so-called interest is not purely based on learning interest. If you are interested in a certain subject in middle school, you cannot determine that it can be a lifelong career. The first section of this article discusses the principle of being good at subjects, and this has already been explained, so interests in other things besides subjects are also important references. For example, students like to be the president of the student union, like to give speeches, like to appreciate nature, like to contribute to newspapers and magazines, like to do experiments in the laboratory, like to read books in the library, and other trivial interests, etc., are all related to going to school and choosing departments and lifelong careers, and must not be ignored. Darwin liked to play with insects when he was young, Edison liked to collect old machine parts when he was young, and the Prime Minister liked to fight injustice when he was young. These are all manifestations of interest, that is, expressions of what is close to nature. Successful people are like this, and ordinary people are also like this. In my personal experience, when I was young, I liked to invite neighborhood children to my home to open a school. Looking back, I still feel interested now. You just need to think back to when you were young, you must have had your own interesting things to play with. If you can't think of anything, it's mostly because you didn't pay attention, of course, there are also those who didn't have the opportunity to express themselves, and therefore haven't been discovered. Legend has it that Wang Xizhi's family had a maid who was extremely clumsy in doing things and was not liked by the family. One day, Wang Xizhi went out to meet guests, and there was a piece of calligraphy in the study that had not been finished. The maid suddenly touched her spirit and continued writing a few words. When Xizhi returned to the room and saw it, he was very pleased, so he taught her to practice writing and no longer looked down on her. Therefore, later generations said that in Wang Xizhi's family, there was no one who couldn't write. There are endless careers in the world, and there are always things that are close to your temperament. The same is true for major departments. If you have found that you are interested in a certain thing, you sometimes cannot simply determine which subject is close to your nature. For example, when you are in school, you like to be the president of the student union. On the surface, it is easy to think that you are suitable for studying politics. In fact, people who like to be responsible in small groups are suitable for politics, but also suitable for studying personnel management, suitable for operating industry and commerce, and suitable for being the head of a school or institution. Therefore, there are many manifestations of interest that must be analyzed and referenced with other conditions before you can determine which subject is close to your nature.

(3) Experience and environment, wisdom and talent, must be enlightened before they can be discovered. Therefore, experience and environment are indispensable conditions for choosing a department. The so-called experience refers to the things that an individual has learned, done, or been exposed to in the past. Those with more experience in literature are suitable for studying literature, and those with more experience in science are suitable for studying science. Mr. Liang Rengong had read many Chinese books in Wanmu Caotang before he was twenty years old, and he was very fond of history books, so later his contribution to historiography was particularly great. Mr. Hu Shi especially liked to read novels when he was young, so later he advocated the vernacular literature movement. A person, when young, has more contact with a certain aspect of knowledge due to a certain opportunity, and unconsciously, his emotions are affected by it, and later he will go that way. Therefore, young people who aspire to go to school must experience their personal past experience. If they have more materials in a certain subject, it can be used as an important reference for choosing a department. In terms of environment, the family background and the community where they are located are of great importance. In the past, China had so-called "scholarly families" and "farming and reading families." In the former society where "those who excel in learning become officials," reading and becoming an official were linked. Reading was a preparation for becoming an official, and becoming an official was the result of reading. The father became an official, the son read books, and the son wanted to become an official after reading books. This sentence "scholarly family" is not wrong at all. The books that were read at that time were simple and did not require many facilities and experiments, so reading and farming were also very easy to link together. Although society has changed now, the family's occupational background is still very related to the future of the children going to school. Although everyone has a share in studying, and reading is no longer the specialty of scholarly families, it is best for the children of a commercial family not to choose the departments of literature, history, philosophy, education, or politics, because the mind and spirit required to study these subjects cannot be cultivated by a business family. If you force yourself to learn, you will not be able to achieve good results. Young people from business families can study commerce, law, economics, and medicine. The family background and the subjects they study should always have a considerable match, just like brightly colored clothes that are not suitable for every woman to wear. The colors that are suitable for people with fair skin are not suitable for people with dark skin. If you force yourself to wear them, you will inevitably "follow suit." The relationship between family background and subjects is not only about inherent habits. The future way out is also related. In a certain family, you can learn certain similar departments, and the opportunity to work in the future will naturally be easier. My opinion is not to say that "the son of a scholar will always be a scholar" and "the son of a worker will always be a worker." Guanzi's disciple Zhi had such a proposition in one article. In today's era, I don't think so. However, I think it is quite correct that an individual's subject should not be too far from the family's occupation. Furthermore, the social environment in which an individual is located is also very important. It is difficult for a person who grows up in an urban society to study agriculture to achieve better results than a person who studies agriculture in a rural society. What they have seen and heard in the society where they grew up is richer, and after graduation, the problems they encounter and the things they should do will naturally still be in the society where they are located. Therefore, choosing a department cannot be too far away from your own society.

The various public championships organized by the Shanghai Amateur Swimming Association were originally scheduled to hold three preliminary rounds at the French Chamber of Commerce pool the night before last. However, due to the withdrawal of Jofrelo and Famao, the 100-yard freestyle and 220-yard junior freestyle were not held. Chinese athletes Wen Jingling and Mu Shungen were both automatically selected. The preliminary round has now been completed, and the first day of the finals will begin at 9:15 PM tomorrow night at the French Chamber of Commerce swimming pool. The program includes five events. In addition to the above two events, there are also the women's 50-yard prone swim, fancy diving, and the men's 150-yard backstroke.

### Guerrillas Active Along Transportation Lines; Destroyed Seven Highway Bridges; Wreckage of Henglin Train Lies on the Roadside; Missing Japanese Sentries: Two Killed, One Injured; Witnessed by Returning Shanghai Passengers

Dalu Bao reports that, according to travelers returning to Shanghai after passing through large portions of Jiangsu guerrilla areas, Japanese authorities have implemented special precautions along the railway line connecting to the concessions here to counter the guerrillas' activity. Despite the Japanese precautions, guerrillas remained very active last week, destroying bridges, disrupting traffic, and blowing up trains and vehicles. A certain foreigner arriving from eastern Jiangsu Province claimed that the number of Japanese armed guards along the Jinghu Road and Sujia Road areas, which are frequently attacked by guerrillas, has greatly increased. He traveled by bus from Changshu to Suzhou and saw seven bridges along the road that had been completely or partially destroyed by guerrillas. Temporary wooden bridges had been erected where repairs were incomplete. This shows how active the guerrillas are, because Suzhou is only 30 miles from Changshu, and the Japanese and puppet troops must have been carefully defending it. However, the guerrillas were able to burn or blow up bridges at will, causing major traffic disruptions. Another foreigner described the circumstances of the train from Shanghai to Suzhou being bombed by guerrillas last Saturday. He said that he originally wanted to take the train that departed from Shanghai early on Saturday morning, but he arrived at the station too early and the ticket purchase was delayed. He had to take the train the next morning, but this rescheduling may have saved his life. He took the train the next morning and arrived at Henglin near Suzhou, where he saw the wreckage of the train that had departed the previous day lying on the roadside. The stations along the way, where Japanese troops were not seen even two or three weeks ago, are now fully guarded. When the train arrived in Suzhou, many passengers were questioned and some were searched. Another traveler arriving from towns west of Shanghai spoke of Japanese soldiers burning many farmhouses in the outskirts. Reportedly, after three Japanese sentries went missing on July 29, Japanese soldiers immediately set fire to the houses. They later found that two of the three sentries had been killed, and the other was lying on the roadside with severe gunshot wounds. A team of Japanese soldiers was ordered to search the area, allegedly to search for the guerrillas who had ambushed the Japanese sentries, but they found nothing except three people who were strong and healthy and recognized by others as ordinary farmers. Gunfire has erupted frequently in the suburbs of Shanghai and the towns west of Shanghai recently.

### Our Newspaper's Repair of Electrical Wiring Accidental Triggering of Alarm

At around 2:30 PM yesterday, the electrical equipment of this newspaper experienced a minor breakdown. Workers were promptly instructed to repair it. Unexpectedly, the workers mistakenly identified the circuit and triggered the alarm bell. As a result, the police department, thinking that an accident had occurred, immediately dispatched patrol cars and armed detectives to investigate. At the same time, this newspaper also automatically discovered the situation and sent an apology to the police department.

### Western Woman's Legal Tender Confiscated; Japanese Side Fabricates Pretext; Claims Limit of 500 in Cash Applies to All Travelers

Zi Lin Bao reports that the Japanese side received news reporters yesterday (the 2nd), asking about a Western woman who had been searched when she left Tianjin and whose legal tender had been confiscated. The embassy spokesperson said that searching foreign travelers entering and exiting Qingdao or any other North China port can be considered a legitimate procedure, and the responsible military officer determines the outcome. Travelers are allowed to bring 500 Japanese yen in cash into North China ports. If the limit is exceeded, a draft must be obtained. This rule has been in effect since May and applies to all travelers, not just British expatriates.

### Japanese Side, Together with Police, Arrests Two Chinese

She Wen She reports that at around 2:00 PM one day, plainclothes Japanese personnel again went to the Public Concession and, together with personnel from the police department, rushed to a certain number in Fuxin Lane, Lane 920, Xinzha Road (i.e., Fukang Lane), and arrested two residents. It is reported that the arrested were postal workers. The reason for the arrest is unknown.

### Four Banks Ordered to Form Committee to Manage Domestic Remittances; Aimed at Preventing Outflow of Funds from the Interior; At the Same Time Encouraging the Transfer of Funds from Shanghai to the Interior; Whether a Branch Will Be Established in Shanghai Is Undecided

In order to control domestic remittance business, prevent the outflow of legal tender from the interior, and encourage the inflow of funds to the interior, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China to organize a domestic remittance management committee to prevent the outflow of funds from the interior and encourage the transfer of funds from Shanghai to the interior. The details are as follows:

Forward and Reverse Remittances Have Different Characteristics

Remittance is the clearing of debts between two places, without the transfer of cash, but using one party's claim to repay the other party's debt. Domestic remittance is divided into "forward remittance" and "reverse remittance." In forward remittance, the debtor pays the money to the remitting bank and entrusts the remitting bank to transfer it to its agent bank in another location to pay the money to the creditor to clear the debt. Therefore, the initiative of the remittance comes from the debtor. In reverse remittance, the creditor issues a draft to the debtor, ordering the debtor to pay the money to the remitting bank's agent bank in another location. The creditor first sells the draft to the remitting bank to obtain cash and recover his claim. The initiative of the remittance comes from the creditor.

National Banks and Money Shops Handle Remittances

The prerequisite for banks and money shops to undertake this kind of remittance is that they must have branch offices established in domestic locations. Ordinary remittance locations are limited to the location where branch offices are located. However, banks can also enter into remittance contracts with peer banks in other locations, such as Zhejiang Local Bank, Jiangsu Farmers Bank, Jiangxi Yumin Bank, etc., which have all entered into contracts with each other to handle remittances. However, domestic remittances of various banks and money shops all use "forward remittance" and are divided into "mail transfer," "telegraphic transfer," "electronic transfer," "bill of exchange," "current account remittance," and "traveler's checks." As for "reverse remittance," it is mostly used when drawing bills. Drawing bills is also one of the businesses of banks and money shops.

Establish Committee to Manage Remittances

The Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China have been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to organize a domestic remittance management committee to implement the management of domestic remittance business. The committee is located in the headquarters of the four banks in Chongqing. Branches are established throughout the country, attached to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China. Remittances from the interior to the occupied areas of the coast, such as Shanghai, are limited to the purchase of daily necessities and should first apply to the remittance management committee, stating the purpose, amount, location of remittance, and supporting documents from the merchant, in order to prevent the outflow of funds from the interior.

Encourage Funds to Flow into the Interior

In addition, the inflow of funds to the interior is encouraged. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China provide various conveniences for remittances from Shanghai to the interior. It is stipulated that remittances to the interior, regardless of location, are exempt from remittance fees and only charged a handling fee of one yuan per thousand national currency, and can be paid with Shanghai-general remittance instruments. The interior can receive the full amount of cash. If entrust the Bank of Communications to remit the banknotes of Tianjin, Shandong, Hubei to the interior, in addition to being free of charge, no handling fee will be charged. Since the implementation, remittances from Shanghai to the interior have surged.

Strictly Restrict Remittances from the Interior to Shanghai

A reporter from New Sound News learned from banking circles yesterday that Shanghai is one of the occupied areas, so there is no need to set up a domestic remittance management committee. As for remittances from the interior to Shanghai, in the current situation, about 1,400 yuan in cash in Kunming, Chongqing, and other places is equivalent to 1,000 yuan in Shanghai. Remittances from the interior are cash, and the recipients in Shanghai are remittances. After the establishment of the domestic remittance management committee, remittances from the interior to Shanghai cannot be entrusted to banks, money shops, or post offices for remittance without the review and approval of the domestic remittance management committee. Remittances to Shanghai are particularly strict.

Shanghai Branch Only Provides Inquiries

According to banking circles, the headquarters of the management committee will begin work within the week. As for the Shanghai side, according to inquiries from the reporter of this newspaper to the person in charge of banking circles last night, it is learned that the Shanghai four banks have not yet received a formal order from the headquarters, so it is not yet certain whether a branch will be established in Shanghai. According to the person in charge's observation of the nature of this measure, its main purpose is to prevent the outflow of funds from the interior. Therefore, strict management is imposed on remittances from Chongqing and other places to Shanghai. In other words, all those who have been approved by the general and branch committees of domestic remittances in Chongqing and other interior areas to remit funds to Shanghai, the Shanghai branch will naturally pay accordingly. Therefore, the examination and approval of whether to remit or not is purely in the hands of the general and branch committees in the interior. The Shanghai side only provides inquiries for the general and branch committees. The Shanghai four banks are waiting for orders from the headquarters before complying. The person in charge also said that the government is still very convenient in terms of procedures for transferring funds from Shanghai to the interior and developing production in the interior.

### Cattle Barred from Entering Shanghai

Cattle from the suburbs being transported into the concessions are now being blocked by the puppet regime. The day before yesterday, more than ten head of cattle were being slaughtered on Dongchang Road in Pudong, intending to cross the river and be transported into the isolated island, but they were blocked and sent back. Yesterday morning, eight head of cattle were being slaughtered at South Wharf, intending to cross the river, but they were detained by the puppet "water police team" and the people and cattle were escorted to the puppet "judicial branch." They were not released until late.

### Terrorists in Western Shanghai Disarmed by Italian Defense Forces; Tense Situation Yesterday Morning; Almost a Conflict; But Subdued by Italian Troops; 26 People Detained

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the situation was tense at the Wujiaochang on Bailinan Road this morning (the 3rd) because armed terrorists, reportedly members of the "Special Task Force" supporting Wang Jingwei, almost clashed with the Italian Marines outside the house at 1081 Jisfeier Road. The house was formerly the headquarters of the Chinese contingent of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and Cao Yi Primary School is now located there. According to unofficial sources, there were 40 or 50 terrorists. These people openly resisted the Italian defense forces against the wall of the house, but eventually succumbed and were disarmed and loaded into an Italian military truck and taken to the Italian military headquarters. Official sources said that a total of 26 people were detained and military Mauser pistols and a large number of weapons were seized. Eyewitnesses also said that there was a rickshaw loaded with a large number of hand grenades, which was being escorted to the Italian military headquarters. It is reported that the terrorists were dispatched from the headquarters at 76 Jisfeier Road, the former residence of Chen Diaoyuan, and the headquarters was recently located in a house on Yidingpan Road and recently moved to 76 Jisfeier Road. It is generally believed that these terrorists are the thugs who recently committed violence in the China-America Daily and the Da Evening News. Just after 9:00 this morning, 40 or 50 people suddenly appeared outside 1081 Jisfeier Road, some wearing long robes and others wearing Western suits, all holding sharp knives, military Mauser pistols, and hand grenades. One of them entered Cao Yi Primary School and said that they would change this house into a headquarters and ordered the school to move out within nine days. According to eyewitnesses, the "Avenue" police were very respectful to these terrorists. Everyone saw them.

The Italian military authorities received the news and dispatched Italian Marines to rush to the scene. Some said that there were as many as 200 Italian soldiers, while officials said that there were 50, surrounding the house and ordering the terrorists to surrender. The terrorists refused and demonstrated with military Mauser pistols against the wall. The two sides were deadlocked until 11:37, when the terrorists finally succumbed. At that time, the situation was tense and nearby shops were closed in a hurry. There were few pedestrians on the road except for a few curious onlookers.

It was also learned that a total of 16 people were detained by the Italian soldiers. After investigation, it was found that they were officials of the "Avenue" municipal government and were all released at around 4:00 PM yesterday.

### Vigorous Market Chips, Bank Deposits Surge, Promising Results from the Remittance System, and Substantial Outstanding Discounts Handled by the Four Banks

Shanghai's Financial Market Remains Stable

After the Joint Bank Reserve Committee handled interbank remittances, all banks and firms provided assets to apply for withdrawals from the committee. The committee assessed the value of the collateral based on the actual needs of each bank and firm, allowing them to withdraw remittances up to 70% of the assessed value. Member Qian Zhuang of the Money Trade Association collectively recognized withdrawals of 10 million yuan, which has been reviewed and completed by the association and submitted the recognized amounts for each firm to the Bank Reserve Committee. The recognized amounts for each commercial bank have also been assumed. Due to the conversion of principal and interest payments of unified public bonds into remittances by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, the circulation of remittance instruments has surged. The payment institutions for these remittances have all been centralized in the Bank Reserve Committee.

Market Increase in Cash Chips

In order to regulate the funds of the same industry and facilitate the payment of legal tender deposits below 500 yuan, the Silver and Money Trade Associations consulted with the Central, China, and Communications Banks to convert the 22 million yuan of remittance funds deposited by each bank and firm in the Silver and Money Trade Association's reserve at the end of June into legal tender in twelve weekly installments for turnover. Since the implementation on July 4th, five installments have been released every week until August 1st, totaling 9 million yuan of legal tender, meaning that the legal tender chips in the market have increased by 9 million yuan. All banks and firms are following the previously agreed-upon method to withdraw legal tender from the reserve. It is reported that the sixth installment is scheduled for payment on August 8th.

The Four Banks Continue to Handle Discounts

In order to promote the circulation of capital for domestic financial, agricultural, mining, industrial, and commercial sectors, the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks established a Joint Discount Committee in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's order. The scope of discounts is divided into (1) mortgage, (2) re-mortgage, (3) discount, and (4) loan. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. The Shanghai Discount Committee continues to handle discount work. As of the end of last month, the outstanding loan balance was reported to be 14 million yuan. However, future discounts will be handled by the Silver and Money Trade Associations. The association's announced (1) discount rate of 7.5% and (2) loan interest of 2.5% have remained unchanged, which is sufficient proof of the stability of Shanghai's financial market.

Financial Markets Have Stabilized

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the banking sector yesterday that Shanghai's financial market has stabilized. For example, the black market exchange rate has eased, gold prices have fallen, the securities black market has surged, remittance spreads have narrowed, and the interbank lending rates and various interest rates of the Bank Reserve Committee have remained largely unchanged. The deposit and withdrawal frenzy at various banks and firms has completely subsided. Since this week, bank and firm deposits have increased. Although Ma Dian stipulated deposit and withdrawal methods, withdrawals by depositors have greatly decreased. After consideration, various banks and firms have decided on methods for using excess funds. Recently, remittances to the interior have surged, and speculative transactions have decreased compared to before. This is truly a good phenomenon for the Shanghai market.

Good Suggestions for Managing Foreign Exchange

According to a financial magnate yesterday, there are two reasons for the impact of foreign exchange: (1) Foreign banks should no longer provide foreign exchange when the exchange rate is shortened, which is commonly known as "having a price but no market." (2) The black market is restless and deliberately creates mystery in an attempt to speculate, giving the Japanese an opportunity to take advantage. However, in my opinion, the central government has established a sound plan. Before implementation, it should adopt public opinion as much as possible as a supplementary measure. The best approach is that Shanghai no longer provides foreign exchange to various industries and instead, the head offices of the Central, China, and Communications Banks in Chongqing should carefully provide it. Chongqing is the governing body, and the Hong Kong branches of the three banks are the external liaison offices. All approved quotas should be subject to the instructions of the Chongqing head office. If this method is implemented, no matter what conspiracies villains may devise, they will have no chance to succeed.

### It is Reported That the Zhejiang Authorities Have Approved the Opening of Aojiang

However, the River is Shallow and Narrow, and Large Vessels Cannot Enter

The original shipping routes to Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, in eastern Zhejiang, included the Oujiang, Aojiang, Chumen, and Pingyang Rivers. Before the war, they were all operated by domestic ships. Since August 13th, the authorities have strengthened defense, so Aojiang Estuary and others are still absolutely prohibited. It is reported that a flexible approach has been approved to open Aojiang Estuary, which is more than a hundred miles away from Oujiang Estuary, allowing foreign ships to navigate. From there, it can reach Pingyang, Chumen, and Wenzhou. However, the waterway at the estuary is shallow and narrow, and only ships under 1,500 tons, such as Baoli and Haifu, can navigate. It is reported that shipping companies are currently completing registration procedures to operate.

Shanghai Ships Stalled in Zhenhai

The Far East Hana ship left Shanghai for Zhenhai on the morning of the 2nd. The Sino-Italian De Ping ship left for Zhenhai yesterday morning. Currently, ships remaining in Zhenhai include Baoli (Yi Hua Foreign Company), Du Guo Zhu (Li He Shipping Department), and four others.

Zhenhai Lighterage

Currently, the Ningbo Defense Department no longer restricts the exit of women and children. Able-bodied men who can provide a 2,000 yuan shop guarantee and return to Ningbo within two weeks are also allowed to exit. There are no restrictions on those traveling from Shanghai to Ningbo. As a result, the number of passengers entering and leaving has suddenly increased. For example, the Shang Ban Mou Fu ship came to Shanghai with more than 2,000 passengers. As a result, lighterage vessels are in short supply, and ships are delayed in Zhenhai.

### Following Smedley, a Beautiful Woman Writer Goes to the Front Lines

Praising the Work of 50,000 Students in Jin and Shaanxi Provinces, Engaged in Political Organization and Guerrilla Tactics

According to the Mainland News, the American female writer Ms. He Mo came to Shanghai last November and transferred to the Chinese mainland. After a period of nine months, Ms. He is the first female writer to go to the front lines in China after Smedley. She has recently returned to Shanghai. Yesterday (the 6th), she told reporters that she followed Dr. Bai Lang of the Wuhu Church and entered the mainland via Wenzhou, passed through Nanchang to Guilin, encountered a major bombing, and then arrived in Chongqing. She traveled with Dr. Luo Ai of Jinling University by truck via Xi'an to Yan'an. She heard that the situation of refugees in Zhengzhou was not good, so she traveled along the Longhai Road on the banks of the Yellow River from Xi'an. Japanese planes bombed between Luoyang and Zhengzhou, but there were many people along the way.

Traveling East

She did not even glance at the shells whistling past and exploding one or two miles away. Ms. He enthusiastically talked about her trip to the secret headquarters of General Yan Xishan near the east bank of the Yellow River in Jin Province. According to her, it is a joke to say that Chinese students are doing nothing. There are now 50,000 students in Jin and Shaanxi provinces who are studying political organization and guerrilla tactics. Their training program is similar to the Red Army School in Yan'an, but without the radical thinking of the students in Yan'an.

More Practical

Engaged in excellent work, these students have endured all kinds of hardships from all over China. They are very distressed when they arrive, but soon resume a vigorous life. Many people in Jin and Shaanxi provinces live in caves. The countryside is vast, the hills undulate, and villages are rare, but the population is large, agricultural production is scarce, and food is not in short supply. Yan's subordinates have ample food for mountain warfare. Travelers on the road need not worry about shortages of necessities, but the area urgently needs relief funds, medical personnel, and medicine. Farmers organize stretcher teams to carry the wounded. Hospitals are set up in mountain caves, but lack surgical equipment. There is no road to southwestern Jin Province. The Japanese army's well-equipped transportation facilities have been completely destroyed. A certain medical school in Linfen has established its headquarters on the west bank of the Yellow River, with 200 students working to the best of their ability. Nearby military hospitals benefit from this. The most amazing place Ms. He saw in Jin Province was Jixian, which had been lost, burned, recovered, and then rebuilt twice.

When she arrived in Jixian, the Japanese army was twenty miles away, and the county was already in its third reconstruction. In June, Ms. He arrived in Yan'an, originally planning to go to Beiping, but then gave up. The Eighth Route Army provided a truck to send her to Xi'an. On the way to Chongqing, she passed many model villages built by the New Life Movement for the homeless. The villagers are all self-reliant. While staying in Chongqing, she saw American relief organizations using funds raised in the United States to provide relief to orphans and refugees. A day or two after arriving in Chongqing, she received news of a night raid and witnessed intense air combat. She then flew to Hong Kong and transferred to Shanghai.

### Overseas Chinese Remittances for Disaster Relief

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens Group Solicitation Committee received a letter yesterday from Mr. Geng Jiatuo, an overseas Chinese in France: "Dear Sirs, I have received your letter of April 6th, along with the receipt and five refugee adoption certificates, which have been duly received. I am now enclosing a check for 300 francs for the second half of this year, July, August, September, October, November, and December, for my personal relief of four refugees, as well as funds raised from friends, including 300 francs from Mrs. Liu Qiaosheng of the Spanish Embassy, and 144 francs each from Mr. Wang Zhennan and his wife, totaling 1,176 francs. Please check and acknowledge receipt, and please send the receipts directly to each donor. If there are any subsequent donations, they will be sent at any time. Furthermore, donors here pay the donations in full at the time of adoption, so refugee adoption certificates do not seem necessary. I have cut off the last page with the solicitation of refugee adoption methods and sent it to friends to encourage donations. I am now returning the original five certificates in a separate envelope. Please check accordingly."

### Affected by Rising Raw Material Prices, Industrial Recovery Suffers Another Setback

Production Decreases in Industries Relying on Imported Raw Materials, Rising Prices Affect Sales, It is Better to Sell Existing Materials. The Industry Department of the Public Works Department reported in July that the peak of industrial recovery in the city seems to have passed. On the one hand, due to seasonal factors, the output of certain industries has decreased. On the other hand, restrictions on withdrawals, foreign exchange shortages, lack of raw materials, and the blockade of seaports all affect factory production. Factories north of the Suzhou River are less affected because their products are sold to various parts of the lower Yangtze River. However, the biggest difficulty faced by the industry as a whole is the rising price of raw materials. Factories manufacturing daily necessities whose raw materials come from abroad, such as rubber shoe factories (three-quarters of raw materials purchased from abroad), enamel factories (seven-tenths of raw materials purchased from other ports), cigarette factories, thermos factories, and glass factories, have seen their production decrease. Since the initial tightening of foreign exchange, factories once raised the prices of their goods by 10% to 15%, but later, realizing that a further price increase would inevitably affect sales, they had to implement reduced working hours or shutdowns. Some manufacturers who purchased raw materials before the foreign exchange shrinkage are unwilling to manufacture goods and would rather sell the raw materials for profit, which will inevitably add to the unemployed workers.

Sawmills

Due to the inability to purchase timber in Wenzhou and other ports in eastern Zhejiang, coupled with the high cost of imported timber, the bleak prospects for their business are not difficult to imagine. Flour mills can maintain production because of the current sufficient wheat reserves. Seasoning powder factories are doing well because their products are sold overseas. There are currently 46 silk reeling factories in the city. They started work once before the cocoon season, but many have no intention of resuming operations. Fresh cocoons are scarce and expensive. Those who beat reeling silk to supply local demand suffer more losses, but those who are equipped with new silk reeling equipment and whose raw silk is sold on foreign markets have a better grasp of their business. Last month, the Industry Department sent personnel to conduct preliminary inspections of a total of 58 factories, most of which are located in the eastern district.

Collective Training

The seventh boiler operator training class for factories in the northern district ended on July 14th. Sixty-four students passed the examination and were given certificates. On the 12th of last month, the Shanghai Water and Electricity Company demonstrated the proper use of the "Bunsen" lamp to ten owners of small light bulb factories. On the 14th of the same month, the owners of thermos factories also held a meeting, during which the Industry Department taught them the use of spray paint. On the 26th of the same month, the Industry Department convened 14 boiler factory owners and informed them of the registration procedures that should be handled.

Steam Machines

A total of 48 boilers were registered for registration and numbering. A total of 29 installation verification certificates were issued. Last month, experts certified and supervised a total of 107 steam machines. One inspector had stamped the official numbers compiled by the Industry Department on 125 boilers in the past two months. This procedure allows all owners of the boilers to understand the importance of maintaining their boilers. One boiler installed in a certain factory was certified by two engineers as dangerous, and the Public Works Department prohibited its use, causing the factory to temporarily shut down. Last month, two boiler manufacturing factories applied for registration, and six factories were approved for registration.

Accidents

A total of 170 occupational and industrial accidents were reported last month, including 12 fatal accidents, one female death, and 12 injuries. The causes of 146 accidents have been confirmed, and 51 accidents have been investigated in detail. According to the classification of causes, accidents caused by electrical machinery were the most common, with 42 cases, including 4 fatalities. Nine workers were injured and four died from electricity. Eight workers were injured and four died from molten, hot, or corrosive substances. According to the classification of industries, the most accidents occurred in the textile industry. There were 18 fires in factories, fortunately with no deaths or injuries.

Labor Disputes

The Industry Department paid attention to six labor disputes, one each in the printing and battery industries. They were resolved without the mediation of the Industry Department. A rubber factory announced its closure, and its 270 workers wrote to the Public Works Department for relief. The factory then agreed to pay funds to the Refugee Relief Association for the association to house and provide for the workers and their families. Another dispute occurred in a cigarette factory, where the factory dismissed 100 female workers, causing a dispute. As a result, the factory paid severance pay. The Industry Department plans to send these workers to work in yarn factories after receiving preliminary training. Bookbinding workers and flour mill porters went on strike once each, demanding increased wages.

Worker Treatment

Several yarn factories, seeing the difficulties in the lives of workers, have increased their wages. Several factories located in the western district determine the amount of wage increase based on the rise and fall of rice prices. Several factories also issue fixed amounts of subsidies.

Cost of Living Index

The cost of living index for July increased again, nearly doubling compared to 1936, or 193 points. Comparing the various indices for June and July, the food category increased by 9.56%, the rent category increased by 4.67%, the fuel category increased by 5.58%, and the miscellaneous category increased by 0.46%. However, the clothing category decreased slightly.

### Compulsory Sale of Rice Imminent, Sufficient Flour Reserves, Rice Merchants Request Measures to Transport Anhui Rice, Authorities Increase Secret Agents to Investigate the Rice Market

According to the Public Works Department's investigation results, the city has sufficient flour reserves, totaling more than 3,910,000 bags. The current daily sales volume is 8,000 bags. Based on this calculation, the total reserves are sufficient for more than 16 months. This shows that the city's food supply is not at risk of shortage.

Black Market Transactions

Since the authorities of the two concessions strictly enforced price limits and punished rice merchants who raised prices, the market situation was stable for a time. It is feared that general speculative hoarders and unscrupulous merchants, disregarding the people's food, are actually doing a lot of black market transactions. Because the market is closely monitored by police detectives, fearing that secrets will be leaked, they only negotiate the quantity of transactions, and the price is directly agreed upon by the buyer and seller, without going through the market. According to reports from Daguan News Agency, the market price made in the black market in recent days has reached more than 23 yuan at the highest. Yesterday, it rose again by four or five cents. Other guest husks, such as those on various roads, were originally priced at a maximum of 16 yuan, but now they have exceeded between 18 yuan and 19 yuan. This situation is clearly manipulated, and it is hoped that the authorities will decisively deal with it to maintain the food supply for the five million people in Shanghai.

Increase Secret Agents to Investigate Openly and Secretly

The Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the Gong Department of the French Concession have recently increased the number of detectives disguised as merchants to infiltrate the market, and patrol around the trading platforms of more than 100 rice shops to investigate openly and secretly. If transactions exceeding the limit are discovered, they will be investigated. It is heard that once a price-gouging rice merchant is arrested, in addition to revoking the business license, the masterminds of both the buyer and seller will be severely punished according to the law, without leniency.

Compulsory Sale at Fair Prices, Rewards for Reporting

The Daguan News Agency learned that, in order to thoroughly understand the total amount of rice stored in various warehouses in Shanghai and the names of the owners, the authorities issued a notice last week, ordering the warehouses to fill in the quantity of rice stored in detail for verification. The procedure for investigating rice storage has been completed, and will be actively implemented in accordance with the methods decided upon in the consultation. When necessary, the owners will be notified to sell at a compulsory fair price. On the one hand, citizens will be encouraged to report private hoarding of rice and transactions exceeding the limit. On the other hand, another announcement will be issued in the next day or two, advising rice merchants not to raise rice prices in order to maintain the food supply. According to reports, rice industry groups have requested the Public Works Department to find ways to transport Anhui rice to Shanghai for relief, due to the scarcity of rice arriving in Shanghai and the thinning of reserves.

### Japanese Conspiracy to Pay Taxes with Counterfeit Money, But Legal Tender Cannot Be Destroyed, It is also Impossible to Obtain Foreign Exchange

According to the Mainland News, a financial expert in this city stated yesterday (2nd) when meeting with a reporter that the Japanese plan to completely eliminate the circulation of legal tender in the Shanghai area and gradually replace it with "Hua Xing" currency is the starting point for Japan's struggle to win financial hegemony here. The announcement on Sunday that six major Japanese banks in this city would exchange "Hua Xing" currency at an official rate of six pence is the latest step in the Japanese plan to squeeze legal tender out of the market. It was previously rumored that Japanese commercial firms here would issue this counterfeit currency to employees in the future, and it was recently announced that rents, taxes, and officials in the Japanese-controlled areas of the city would be paid in "Hua Xing" currency, which further confirms that the Japanese have begun their deep-seated plan to undermine legal tender. Furthermore, the amount of "Hua Xing" currency in circulation was close to one million yuan on July 16th, and on July 31st, the bank announced that it had reached 1.4 million yuan. As far as the Japanese government is concerned, the current policy of the Japanese army seems to be unilateral. Shortly after the devaluation of legal tender on July 14th, it was heard that the Japanese Asia Development Board, which controls "Hua Xing Bank," and the Japanese Ministry of Finance had a conflict over the future of the counterfeit bank. The Ministry of Finance wanted to use "Hong Kou currency" only as a

Way to Obtain Foreign Exchange

Stating that although the exchange rate of legal tender has fallen, it is still used as "internal currency" and is widely used. The Asia Development Board opposes this, advocating the forced circulation of "Hua Xing" currency and immediately severing all relations with legal tender. However, both sides agreed to fix the price of "Hua Xing" currency at six pence, making the counterfeit currency another step in dominating power here. In some aspects, Japanese people advocate the forced use of "Hua Xing" currency to pay all customs duties, but Tokyo has already added its recognition to this. Regarding the possibility that the Japanese army will imitate Tianjin and block Shanghai when it is no longer possible, yesterday

Opinions Diverged

Some pointed out that the harsh methods of the Japanese army in North China are not enough to drive legal tender out of the foreign concessions, but this decision includes the recognition of "the needs of the Japanese in occupied areas arising from special circumstances" in the Anglo-Japanese compromise, and its power may be applied to the situation in this city. The Yokohama Specie Bank replied to an inquiry from a foreign bank in this city yesterday as to whether it would purchase "Hua Xing" currency at the prescribed price, stating that it was unaware of the matter.

### The Lower Yangtze River Shipping Business is Not Easy, Foreign Ships Continue to Navigate, Sacrifices are Inevitable

Since the Sino-Japanese War, the Yangtze River has been blockaded at Jiangyin, the navigation route has been cut off, shipping has been suspended, Chinese merchants have stopped operating, and foreign merchants have switched to the lower reaches, namely Xin Port, Xinsheng Port, Zhang Huang Port, and Dongjie Port in Jingjiang County, Tiansheng Port and Yao Port in Nantong County, and the ports of Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, etc. In

The Past Six Months

Shipping on this route has been unusually prosperous, and northern Jiangsu has relied on it to open up. Therefore, at the peak of this period, there were as many as twenty or thirty ships sailing to the above-mentioned ports. However, the organizations of these companies were mostly outsiders. At that time, because inland goods were concentrated in the above-mentioned ports, customers only sought to ship the goods out and did not care about the freight, so business was very easy and profitable. From this year

June 1st

The Japanese army, citing military times, restricted navigation and obstructed foreign ships, and the shipping industry gradually declined. The ships sailing to Xin Port, Xinsheng Port, Zhang Huang Port, and Dongjie Port have successively suspended navigation, and Japanese merchants have added ships to navigate. Although British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire sent Tong He and Wu Lin ships to maintain navigation rights, there were no goods to and from, and passengers were only departing from Shanghai, slightly more than dozens or hundreds. Those returning to Shanghai from Xin Port, etc.

There Was Not A Single Person

The two companies continued to navigate at the cost of sacrifices, but the schedule was sometimes slightly extended. Tong He ship returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. It was originally scheduled to export this morning, but due to boiler repairs, it has now been changed to next Tuesday (8th) morning to New Port. Butterfield & Swire Wu Lin ship can arrive this afternoon, and will continue to New Port at 6 am tomorrow. German merchants also have only a few ships such as Ke Si Deng, Hai Kang, and Lu An, etc. The cargo transportation is very bleak, and there are slightly more passengers than British ships. It is heard that

The Japanese Ship Business

Is Also Very Average. The biggest reason for this is that the inland guerrillas do not allow the export of goods, and the Japanese cannot do anything about it. The Chongming route is completely occupied by Japanese merchants, and only the Nissin Company dispatches Zhejiang and Qing Ning ships to sail alone. These two ships were converted from the ferries of the former city ferry. The Haimen-Qidong line has fewer Japanese ships sailing, and the cargo transportation is slightly better. Because there are more ships, if you want to make a profit,

It May Be Very Difficult

Jardine Matheson's Yi He ship has been sailing on the Qi Hai route for a long time. It was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai yesterday, but it is heard that there are still goods waiting to be loaded in the northern sand area, so it has been changed to return to Shanghai today, and will continue to Qinglong and Sanhe Port tomorrow morning.

### Japanese Sealing Off of the North Jiangxi Road Seems to Be Temporary, The Epidemic Prevention Office Removed and Stopped Issuing Passes, But the Future Situation is Still Quite Speculative

The stores, residents, and alleyways on the North Jiangxi Road, which runs from the north end of the Waterworks Bridge in the south to the east end of the Old Bazhi Road in the north, have been suddenly blocked by the Japanese army with wooden poles and barbed wire since the 29th of last month. Although the Japanese soldiers' sentry post at the blocked gap has been removed, the relocation situation has not ended. The open-air epidemic prevention office set up by the Japanese on the eastern section of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road has been removed since yesterday and no longer injects residents living in the newly blocked area with epidemic prevention injections. The passes exchanged for epidemic prevention certificates have also been suspended. It is heard that the passes issued by the Japanese to the residents of the area a few days ago are only valid for two months, which is clearly temporary and different from the long-term passes issued to the residents of Hongkou. Therefore, whether the sealing off of the area is temporary or of the same nature as the Hongkou area is quite speculative.

### Strengthening Management of Ship Traffic at Zhenhai Estuary; Adapting to the Zhenhai Blockade; Reporting Customs Required for Entry and Exit Between Ningbo and Zhenhai

Special Announcement from the Zhejiang Customs Tax Office: This Customs Office is now implementing temporary regulations to adapt to the special circumstances of the Zhenhai Estuary blockade and to strengthen customs management of steamships, tugboats, and gasoline-powered vessels. The regulations are as follows: (1) Passenger steamships and other vessels traveling in the Fenghua River and Yuyao River area shall continue to report entry at the Jiangdong Tax Collection Office of this Customs Office, as per usual practice, and complete customs clearance procedures upon departure. (2) Steamships and other vessels traveling between Ningbo and Zhenhai shall, until further notice, complete import and export customs declaration procedures at the Jiangdong Tax Collection Office if traveling between 5:00 PM and 7:00 AM the next morning. If traveling between 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM, they shall complete import and export customs declaration procedures at the customs wharf. (3) When passing the customs wharf between Ningbo and Zhenhai, all steamships and other vessels must stop, regardless of whether they are entering or leaving, and proceed only after completing customs declaration procedures. (4) Steamships and other vessels towing vessels to transport goods from ships outside the Zhenhai Estuary need not complete import and export procedures at the Zhenhai Branch Station. However, these procedures must be completed with the customs officer stationed on the ship. The above measures shall be implemented from today. This announcement is hereby issued for all shipping merchants to take note of.

### In Addition to Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou, Banknotes from All Other Regions are Valid; Holders Can Exchange for Shanghai Currency at Banks; All Businesses Should Accept Them Without Doubt

To prevent speculators from taking advantage and to encourage the flow of funds into the interior, the China &amp; Communications Banks have stipulated regulations for the exchange of banknotes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou, which have been well-received and supported by banknote holders. However, some people in the market, unaware of the true situation, have refused to accept banknotes from regions other than Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou, as well as subsidiary currency notes from Jiangsu Farmers Bank and Zhejiang Local Bank. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with banking circles again yesterday and learned that banknotes from all banks (including commercial banks) other than those in Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou are fully valid and should no longer be refused. All banknote holders can exchange them for Shanghai-denominated banknotes at designated banks. Subsidiary currency notes issued by Jiangsu Farmers Bank and Zhejiang Local Bank are also fully valid, as these subsidiary currency notes were issued with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Furthermore, the subsidiary currency notes of the Xuzhou Pingshi Official Money Bureau are circulated in the same way as those of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank. However, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank has been trying to recall these subsidiary currency notes, and the number circulating in the market is small. All banknote holders can exchange them at the Jiangsu Farmers Bank.

### A Raging Fire in Datuan Town, Pudong; Burning for Sixteen Hours; Traitorous Police in Tuolin Revolt

Previous reports have detailed the demolition and subsequent burning of houses in Datuan Town by the Japanese army. According to sources who arrived in Shanghai from Pudong yesterday, the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army has been besieging the Japanese army in Datuan, Xinchang, Huicheng, Zhoupu, and other places for three days and nights. The Japanese army is unable to move except to defend their fortifications. When the Loyal Righteous Army first decided to besiege the area, the merchants and residents of Datuan competed to donate food and other items. Enraged, the Japanese army set a large fire on the morning of the 29th. The entire town of Datuan burned from 3:00 AM to around 7:00 AM, with flames soaring high. The people evacuated, leaving the famous and wealthy town of Pudong in ruins. While the Loyal Righteous Army was attacking the Japanese army in various places, a unit under Gu Shouxin secretly attacked Tuolin. The traitorous police chief Liu and his men, numbering over forty, seized the opportunity to revolt, taking with them one machine gun, twenty-eight rifles, and three Mauser pistols. A Japanese instructor named Ogawa and a traitorous police inspector were killed, and two pistols were captured. Liu's unit has now been incorporated into Gu's unit to serve the country.

### White Russian Anti-Communist Association Takes Action; Active in the Hongkou Area; Actions Highly Secretive

The Continental News reports: "The 'Shanghai White Russian Anti-Communist Association,' following the actions of similar groups established after the Japanese army's occupation of Shandong and North China, officially declared its existence yesterday (the 2nd). Members were sent to the homes of White Russian immigrants residing in the Hongkou, Huishan, and Yangshupu areas to distribute what the group calls a 'Questionnaire.'" All White Russian immigrants over the age of eighteen must answer fifteen questions and attach a photograph. The questionnaire bears the name "Shanghai White Russian Anti-Communist Association" but does not state the address of the group's headquarters or other branches. Those who visited White Russian immigrants only told them that they needed to fill out the form and that it would be collected later. In addition to the usual questions found on general application forms, such as name, age, and place of birth, the anti-communist questionnaire also asks for details of the person's stay in China, past and present political affiliations, and a complete military service record. The name of the head of the new organization, the Shanghai White Russian Anti-Communist Association, is not mentioned on the form.

### Lawsuit over Eviction from the Metropolitan; Hengye Company Loses; Having Increased the Rent, They Suddenly Demanded Eviction; Appeal Against Land Rights Dismissed

The land where the Metropolitan Garden Ballroom at 56 Gordon Road is located was originally leased from Puyi Real Estate Company for 700 yuan per month, with no fixed term. After the lease, the Metropolitan invested more than 100,000 yuan to build the ballroom and arrange the garden. Three years after the lease, in April of last year, the land was transferred from Puyi Company to the British-owned Hengye Real Estate Company for management.

After Hengye took over the management,

they notified the Metropolitan on the first of this month that the rent would be increased to 850 yuan per month from January 1 of this year. The Metropolitan, fearing the risk of being subjected to rent increases, negotiated with Hengye for a fixed-term contract of three years. Just as the negotiations were about to conclude, Hengye suddenly announced the termination of negotiations and further notified the Metropolitan that it must demolish the buildings on the leased land, restore it to its original state, and terminate the lease from April 5 of this year. In addition to complying with the rent increase

and paying the rent,

the Metropolitan expressed disagreement with the termination of the lease. Hengye then filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against the Metropolitan Ballroom for the termination of the lease. Jiang Yaozhang, the manager of the Metropolitan, appointed lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend, arguing that since the plaintiff had notified the rent increase first and the defendant had complied, the plaintiff now suddenly demanding the demolition of the buildings and restoration to the original state showed that there was another purpose. Although the contract signed by the nominal parties appeared to be a lease, what the defendant actually leased was an empty piece of land, and the Metropolitan invested in building the

building on the land.

Therefore, it was actually a land rights relationship under civil law. According to the regulations on land rights, the contract can only be terminated if the rent is in arrears for more than two years. The Metropolitan does not owe any rent at all, so how can the contract be terminated? Therefore, the court was requested to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit. After the trial, the court ruled to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit. Hengye, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. However, during the appeal process, the Metropolitan obtained an important piece of evidence: a letter from Hengye Company to Dai Zuwen, a former shareholder of the Metropolitan (who had withdrawn his shares),

demanding payment of land rent

of 1,600 yuan, which was for the land where the Metropolitan is now located. The letter stated that the land rent was based on the contract signed on January 24 of this year. This shows that Hengye's lawsuit was based on

Hengye's plan to gain several hundred yuan per month in rent

and sacrificing the interests of others. Therefore, at the hearing of the appeal, lawyer Chen Tingrui presented this evidence to prove that the appellant's purpose in the litigation was contrary to the principles of good faith and credit in transactions. Hengye Company's actions

were obviously inappropriate.

Therefore, the appeal should be dismissed, and the appellant should bear the costs of the second-instance litigation. The case has been heard by the Second Branch of the High Court and a judgment has been announced, dismissing Hengye Company's appeal and ordering the appellant to bear the costs of the litigation.

### A Three-Year-Old Child Scalded to Death by Boiling Water

Yuan Huichuan, a 32-year-old Shaoxing native residing at 671 Rue Massenet in the French Concession, is a merchant dealing in foreign goods. He has a three-year-old son named Shunfa. One day at 3:00 PM, Yuan's wife, feeling hot and stuffy, took a kettle out to fetch hot water and poured it into a bathtub, intending to give the child a bath. Unexpectedly, her son Shunfa, being young and unaware, approached the water and tripped, falling into the hot water. He was scalded on his abdomen and other areas. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but due to the toxins attacking his heart, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 3:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd.

### The Owner of the Yilun Factory in Wuxi Was Abducted and Murdered; Two Robbers Arrested in Shanghai; The Deceased's Wife Ran into Them in Shanghai and They Were Detained for Investigation

Xue Ashun, a 36-year-old man from Wuxi, operated a small silk factory called Yilun in his hometown of Butterfly Village and had accumulated some savings. On May 4 of last year, his home was invaded by more than ten robbers, who stole 780 yuan in cash. Then, on March 25 of this year, the local tyrant Hou Genxiang and his gang kidnapped Xue Ashun and demanded a ransom of 1,900 yuan. Xue's wife, Dai, went to negotiate with Hou, but when they could not agree on a price, Hou detained her and shot her in the head twice, causing injuries. He then shot Xue Ashun, killing him. The ruthlessness of the act was unprecedented. After being detained, Dai was guarded by an old bandit. The bandit, seeing her dire situation, secretly released her. Dai, terrified, fled to Shanghai to work and make a living. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd, while walking past the Liangxi Hotel at 144 Hubei Road, she suddenly saw Hou Genxiang enter.

Upon seeing her enemy, her eyes turned red. She followed him in and learned that Hou was staying in room 20 of the hotel. She asked the hotel staff for assistance, and the hotel reported the matter to the Lao Zha Police Station by telephone. Chief Detective You Agen led detectives Wang Jiaju and Qin Boliang to the scene. By then, Hou had gone to the Aiyou Barber Shop next door at 118 for a haircut. He was taken back to the police station.

According to Hou's defense during interrogation, he was a member of the Self-Defense Corps supported by the Japanese in Wuxi. He reported Xue to the Japanese army as a bandit, and the Japanese army arrested and executed him. As for Xue's wife, Dai, he admitted to punching her in the head, but he denied shooting her. However, the detectives observed that the scars on Dai's head were clearly from a gunshot wound, not from punches. Hou and his accomplice, Pan, were then detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao presented the case and requested temporary detention for investigation. The crime took place in Wuxi, but after the prosecution, he would request the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court to designate jurisdiction. Judge Pan Shide approved the request and ordered Hou and Pan to be strictly detained for further investigation.

### Two Apprentices Squandered Funds; Chen Guanlun's Bad Behavior; Chen Chunzhi Was Greatly Deceived

Chen Chunzhi, an apprentice at the Hesheng Pawnshop at 235 North Henan Road, was a Chaozhou native and had familial ties to the owner, Chen Songyan. He was well-trusted. Although only nineteen years old, he was responsible for managing money. Chen Guanlun, a Jiangyin native and employee of a cigarette paper shop at 247 next door, became acquainted with Chunzhi, and they became very close over time. Recently, Guanlun was dismissed by his employer. He then used deceptive words to

induce Chunzhi to embezzle 500 yuan to go to the interior to do business together. Once they made a great profit, they would no longer have to depend on others. Chunzhi, deceived by his words, stole 550 yuan in banknotes from the pawnshop on the first of last month, abandoned his job, and fled with Guanlun to Caojiadu Town in western Shanghai. They squandered the money at an inn. After about a week, Guanlun took advantage of Chunzhi's absence and stole 200 yuan and a gold ring and silk pants from his suitcase and fled. Since then, Chunzhi lived alone in that place. By the 18th of last month, the money had been spent, and the innkeeper ordered him to leave. With nowhere to go, he returned to the pawnshop

and confessed his previous mistakes to his master, Chen Songyan. Chen then tolerated his behavior without exposing it and continued to employ him while secretly investigating Chen Guanlun's whereabouts. The day before yesterday morning, he saw Guanlun return to the cigarette paper shop and immediately reported it to the Public Concession Police Station. The police chief sent detective Cao Jinbiao to the scene, who arrested Guanlun and brought him and Chunzhi to the police station for interrogation. Both Chen confessed without reservation, but the stolen money had been spent and nothing remained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First District Local Court for investigation. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the case, and Chen Songyan recounted the events. Judge Zhan then interrogated the two defendants. According to Chen Chunzhi's confession, it was Chen Guanlun who started the idea, so Guanlun used or stole all the stolen money, a total of 320 yuan. The remaining money was spent on food and lodging. Chen Guanlun only confessed that the 200 yuan in the suitcase was taken by him privately, that the remaining money was spent together, and denied starting the idea. After the court hearing, both defendants were ordered to be detained for sentencing next Wednesday.

### Fraudulent Schemes Emerge One After Another; Itinerant Magicians Are Rampant; A Foolish Salesman Is Deceived and Fired; An Abominable Magician Cannot Escape the Law

Xu Yushu, the manager of the Yishenghang Wool Shop at 64 Rue Vouille in the French Concession, sent Wei Kuisheng, a salesman from the shop (21 years old, from Shaoxing, promoted from apprentice to salesman), to Taiping Bridge, Ximen Road on the morning of the 14th of last month to collect debts. Unexpectedly, Wei collected 1,000 yuan and met an itinerant magician while walking past Nanyang Bridge. The magician told Wei that he had good fortune and that he could help him with magic, turning ten yuan into much more money in an instant. Wei was young and inexperienced, and greed blinded him. He went with the itinerant magician to a nearby hotel in Nanyang and opened a room. The magician ordered Wei to hand over the 1,000 yuan and put it into a small blue cloth bag, telling Wei to pinch the cloth bag, close his eyes tightly, and wait for the god of wealth to descend. After three hours, he could turn it into 10,000 yuan. Wei believed it was true and pinched the cloth bag tightly with both hands, closing his eyes tightly. The magician stood by his side chanting scriptures. From 12:00 noon to 3:00 PM, Wei heard the magician stop chanting. He opened his eyes and looked at the cloth bag, and the 1,000 yuan in banknotes had turned into waste paper. He tried to find the magician, but he was nowhere to be found. Wei became anxious and reported to the police station, saying that he had encountered a thief between Baxianqiao and Songshan Road who stole 1,000 yuan in banknotes. After investigation by the detectives, the whole story became clear. Wei was detained and sent to the First Special District Court for prosecution. After the trial, Wei was sentenced to 15 days of detention for falsely reporting theft, with a two-year suspended sentence. Xu Yushu, the manager of Yishenghang, had already reconciled with Wei and did not pursue the matter further, only suspending Wei to show a warning. After his job was broken, Wei ran around looking for work for days. The day before yesterday, while walking past the Dadong Tea Room on Nanjing Road, he ran into Yang Dongsheng (28 years old, from Suzhou), the itinerant magician who had previously swindled him out of banknotes. He then shouted for the police and dragged Yang to the Lao Zha Police Station. After questioning, it was learned that the incident occurred in the French Concession, so it was transferred to the French Police Station for investigation. According to Yang's confession, he also had accomplices Zhou Rongfei (24 years old, from Ningbo) and a Yuan, who lived at 5 Ziyang Lane, Lalingde Road. The police chief sent detective Kang Hui to the address and arrested only Zhou Rongfei. Yuan had escaped, and a suitcase containing tools used for magic and conjuring was found under the bed. They were taken back to the police station together. Yesterday, they were sent to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer requested detention for investigation and to arrest the accomplices at large. After Judge Huang Yan interrogated the defendants, he approved the request to detain the defendants for further investigation on another date.

### Overseas Chinese Chen Chang Arrested for Fraud

Chen Hailun (also known as Chen Chang), an overseas Chinese residing in Hong Kong, came to Shanghai from Hong Kong in June and purchased typewriters, radios, and other items from Huang Weirao, an employee of the American-owned Shenchang Foreign Firm. Huang was deceived, and the total price of the goods, 2,030 yuan in legal currency, was never paid. Chen Chang then disappeared. It was not until the day before yesterday that he was arrested by detective Guan Huchen of the Jing'an Temple Police Station. He was sent to the First District Local Court yesterday, where he was brought before Judge Zhan for interrogation. After police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the case, the court questioned the plaintiff and defendant separately and ordered the defendant to be detained for further hearing next Wednesday.

### Residents of Renjili, Ximen Road Oppose a 30% Rent Increase; Representatives Negotiate

Amidst the rising prices of all goods, the landlord of Renjili, Ximen Road, China Construction Real Estate Company, recently notified tenants that rents would be increased by 30% across the board from September 1 (i.e., next month). There are about 70 shops and residences in the lane. After the "August 13th" incident, rents had already been increased by 10%, and tenants were also responsible for water bills. The tenants felt that the landlord's latest notice of a 30% rent increase was too much of a burden. They have now elected a Mr. Zhang as their representative and decided to negotiate with the landlord to withdraw the rent increase.

### High Tide and Rapid Current Yesterday Morning; Water Level Rose Again and Receded Only at Dawn

The high tide of the Huangpu River continued to rise yesterday morning. The Bund shoreline was getting closer to the water level. The tide occurred at about 1:00 AM yesterday morning and receded only at dawn. The current reached a speed of 1.8 nautical miles per hour during high tide, which was very rapid. There will be another high tide tomorrow.

### Concubine Accuses First Wife of Theft

Dai Shoufan, a 62-year-old Fujian native and traditional Chinese doctor, has a small fortune and owns one wife and two concubines. His wife, Qiu (61 years old, Fujian native), lives at 21 Lane 280, Rue Sapey. His concubine, Zhou (46 years old, Fujian native), lives at 5 Leshi Lane, Leshi Road. His second concubine, Li (43 years old, Beijing native), lives at 12 Tingyun Lane, Avenue Lafayette. On the 12th of last month, Dai died of illness at Li's residence. A sutra was recited for Dai at Li's residence the day before yesterday. Li suddenly reported to the French Concession Police Station, accusing Dai's first wife, Qiu, and his concubine, Zhou, of taking the opportunity to steal suitcases and other items. The French Police Station ordered detectives to arrest Dai Qiu and Dai Zhou and sent them to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special District Court yesterday, requesting detention for investigation. Judge Huang interrogated them briefly. The defendant Dai Qiu and others appointed lawyer Ge Zhitan to appear in court, stating that the case concerned family affairs and that there was no theft. After reviewing the statement, the court approved Dai Qiu's release on a 300-yuan shop guarantee and temporarily detained Dai Zhou for further hearing on August 10.

### Traitorous Police Pursue Refugees, Causing a Serious Situation

Yesterday afternoon at about 5:00 PM, several refugees left the refugee camp on Hongqiao Road. The traitorous police of Jiaotong University found out and rushed to chase them back to the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Haig Road. The French police at the intersection stopped them and did not allow them to cross the border. Dozens of traitorous police officers chased after them, and misunderstandings arose, leading to arguments. After the French police learned of the situation, they sent a large number of Chinese, Western, and Russian officers to maintain order, and the traffic was temporarily blocked. The situation was serious, but fortunately, no incident occurred. The police then withdrew.

### Residents of Haigeri Oppose Rent Increase

The tenants of Haigeri Road, Xujiahui, have recently received a letter from the property management office of Ma Dunhou Tang, the landlord of Haigeri, stating that the municipal council is increasing the land tax year by year and repair costs have also increased due to high prices. Therefore, the rent must be increased slightly to compensate. From August 1, each building will increase by four yuan. All tenants oppose the increase and demand that the decision be withdrawn and the increase postponed.

### The Death of Mr. Wu Bogeng in Songjiang

Wu Qianmei, also known as Bogeng, a respected elder in Songjiang, aged 72, was enthusiastic about local public welfare. He served as a director of the Songjiang Charity Board for more than 30 years. During the Jiazi Rebellion, he took the lead in sheltering refugees. Together with the late Shanghai philanthropist Lu Bohong, he founded the Red Cross Hospital in Songjiang City. He experienced major disasters and wars, and no disaster went unaddressed. In 1927, he served as the magistrate of Jiading County, Jiangsu Province, where he had outstanding political achievements. Later, he retired to his hometown due to illness and engaged in charitable activities. When the August 13th Incident occurred, he worked with the Red Cross Society to shelter refugees and benefit his hometown. Recently, his wind illness worsened and was not cured. He passed away suddenly yesterday (the 3rd) at 6:00 AM at his residence in Shanghai on Weihaiwei Road. The funeral will be held at the White Palace Funeral Home at noon on the 5th. At that time, the avenue on Great West Road will be filled with mourning vehicles and white horses.

### Bund Park Concert

The fire was extinguished after the fire brigade drove a pumper truck to the scene to put out the fire. Two buildings were burned down.

### Letter

To the Editor of Shenbao Newspaper,

I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Bao Ruichen, manager of Tianyuanxiang Firm, who informed me that he read a news item in the "Local News" section of Shenbao Newspaper yesterday titled "Thugs Smashed Showcase," which stated, "Last month, the firm was reorganized, and the bookkeeper, Mr. Lu, was publicly elected as manager. Bao was very dissatisfied and lingered, refusing to hand over the job, leading to disputes between the old and new factions." After investigation, Ruichen has been the manager of the firm since its establishment, and there has never been a reorganization or a public election of a bookkeeper named Lu as manager. Furthermore, there is no one named Lu in the firm. This is clearly inconsistent with the facts, affects Ruichen's reputation, and may cause confusion. Please correct the matter on behalf of my client to protect my client's reputation. I would be very grateful.

Sincerely,

Lawyer Wang Shuxun

To the Editor of Shenbao Newspaper,

I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Wang Shaochang, who stated that he read a news item in the news section of Shenbao Newspaper on the 3rd of this month titled "The Anti-Smoking Bureau Abuses the Issuance of Stamps," which stated that the client was implied by Mr. Zhu to help facilitate the matter. I am very surprised. I have never heard of or been involved in the soil business in Shanghai, and I do not know Mr. Zhu at all. How can I facilitate the matter? This is clearly a false rumor. The matter concerns my reputation. I would like to ask your lawyer to send a letter to Shenbao to quickly correct the matter to avoid confusion and mishearing. Accordingly, I am sending this letter to you to check and make corrections. I would be very grateful.

Sincerely,

Lawyers Xue Du, Chen Tingrui, August 3

To the Editor of Shenbao Newspaper,

The "Local News" in your newspaper on the 3rd of this month published an article titled "The Ministry of Finance Holds Domestic Exchange Control," which stated that the Chamber of Commerce used to handle the application for foreign exchange purchases for various industries, which would continue to work as usual. After investigation, this association has never handled the application for foreign exchange purchases, and this association is the Shanghai Commercial French Association. The so-called Shanghai Business Association Shanghai Office is a non-existent title. I hope you will correct it immediately.

Sincerely,

Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce

### The Most Difficult to Treat Ringworm, the Most Famous Sweet Dew, Millions of People's Faith is an Iron Guarantee

A customer asked: I use "Sweet Dew" and never feel any pain. Moreover, once applied, it can stop itching for twenty-four hours, providing coolness, comfort, moisture, and smoothness, which is incomparable to other medicines that cause stinging pain. And the speed at which the affected area recovers often exceeds expectations. What is the reason for this? I said: Ah! This is why Sweet Dew is Sweet Dew. It is the unique aspect of "Sweet Dew." The perfection of the "Sweet Dew" prescription is unmatched at the moment. The main functions of "Sweet Dew" are to kill bacteria, stop itching, remove dampness, and reduce inflammation, and it can also moisturize the skin and prevent pain. Ringworm medicine often loses its moisturizing properties, causing redness, swelling, stinging pain, cracking, and bleeding when applied to the skin. Moreover, the condition remains the same after several peels. This is because the prescription is incomplete. As for "Sweet Dew," it has absolutely no such drawbacks because it contains rich skin moisturizers and sufficient painkillers. Therefore, the value of the raw materials used is extremely high. May I ask, can cheap ringworm medicines imitate this? Sweet Dew has been the most famous remedy for ringworm, eczema, scabies, itching, rashes, and other conditions for more than ten years. It holds the Central Health Administration Drug Permit No. 363 and is one of the famous medicines produced by Shanghai Tongren Western Medicine Company. All major pharmacies and Western medicine departments of major companies nationwide sell it.

### Calm in Financial and Foreign Exchange Markets

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC listing showed no gains or losses. The unofficial British and American exchange market was somewhat loose due to the Bank of Japan's performance and profit-taking. In addition, advantageous actions by the Bank of England (acting on behalf of Tianjin banks) and the Bank of China also contributed to short selling, resulting in a relatively loose initial underlying trend. The British pound once rose to 4 shillings and 5 pence, and the US dollar also fell to 8.75 yuan. Later, because HSBC Bank had unlimited appetite for buying British pounds at 4 shillings and 5 pence, it was hindered. Afterwards, the Yokohama Specie Bank suddenly increased its buying activity, so the market gradually softened. As a result, the price barely changed. It was heard that around 3 o'clock, both the British and American exchange rates returned to the previous day's closing price. At first, the futures for this month were dull due to foreign banks' appetite for buying, so the situation was even looser. The British pound once rose to 4 shillings and 3.75 pence, and the US dollar also briefly recovered to 8.4375 yuan. Later, because Western merchant Sassoon and China merchant seized the opportunity to buy at low prices, the situation recovered slightly. In the end, the British pound barely rose by 0.0625, and the US dollar also barely rose by 0.125. As a result, the swap spread became even narrower. According to the evening closing, the British pound difference was 0.171875, and the US dollar difference was 0.375, which roughly equals a monthly interest rate of slightly over 4.5% after deducting commissions. In reality, arbitrageurs mostly only paid an additional 0.25 US dollars, which roughly equals a monthly interest rate of only about 3% after deducting commissions. Therefore, arbitrage transactions were subdued, while other transactions were still active.

Heavy Selling in the Morning Market

In the early morning, the near and far-term rates of the London big bar (silver bullion) both decreased by 0.125. The New York silver price was stable. The London raw gold price remained unchanged. The British-to-US exchange rate was stable. The British-to-Shanghai rate increased by 0.0625. The British-to-French rate increased by 0.01 franc. The US-to-British rate did not change. The US-to-Shanghai rate increased by 0.1 yuan. The US-to-French rate remained flat. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' morning opening spot selling prices were: British pound at 4 shillings and 0.0625 pence, US dollar at 8.59375 yuan, with no gains or losses compared to the previous closing. After the opening, selling pressure from the Japanese banking sector and advantageous British banks was heavy, and the Bank of China also did not stop selling, so the market trend gradually strengthened. It is estimated that the Japanese banks, advantageous banks, and the Bank of China successively sold spot British pounds at 4 shillings 4.375 pence and 4.6875 pence to foreign bank X (Dutch). Then, the Bank of China and the Japanese bank sold spot US dollars at 8.625 yuan and 8.6875 yuan to Andatsu Transport and Communications Dutch. Until the HSBC listing was announced, there were no changes, and the balance tax on silver was still exempted. After this, advantageous actions again sold spot British pounds at 4 shillings and 5 pence to HSBC. At the same time, the US dollar also rose to 8.75 yuan. At that time, the Bank of China also sold off this month's British pounds, from 4 shillings and 3.125 pence to 3.75 pence. At the same time, foreign banks also briefly recovered this month's US dollar to 8.4375 yuan. Near noon, the British merchant Sassoon suddenly seized the opportunity to buy at low prices, settling this month's US dollar for 8.375 yuan with a foreign bank, so the situation recovered slightly. At that time, the selling price of spot exchange by foreign banks was about 30.05 yuan, which seemed slightly firm. Extending to the noon closing, the banks' spot selling prices were: British pound at 4 shillings and 4.6875 pence, US dollar at 8.6875 yuan, this month's British pound at 4 shillings and 2.5 pence, US dollar at 8.28125 yuan.

Barely Changed

In the afternoon, the market softened again due to the sudden increase in buying activity by the Japanese bank. It is estimated that the Yokohama Specie Bank settled spot British pounds at 4 shillings and 4.375 pence and spot US dollars at 8.65625 yuan with a foreign bank. Afterwards, a Chinese merchant bought this month's US dollars at 8.25 yuan with a foreign bank. Extending to the evening closing, the banks' spot selling prices were: British pound at 4 shillings and 4.21875 pence, US dollar at 8.625 yuan (it was heard that after 3 o'clock, the British pound softened again to 4 shillings and 0.0625 pence, and the US dollar also tightened to 8.59375 yuan), this month's British pound at 4 shillings and 2.5 pence, US dollar at 8.25 yuan. As a result, the spot British pound was slightly firmer by 0.015625 and the US dollar was slightly looser by 0.03125 compared to the previous day. This month's British pound was cheaper by 0.0625, and the US dollar was firmer by 0.25.

Stable Hong Kong Exchange Market

Hong Kong, 3rd. Today's exchange market opened mixed. The British and American exchange rates were unchanged. The Chinese exchange rate decreased by 3 yuan to 317 yuan. Until the later closing, there were no gains or losses.

Stable Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rate

Tianjin, 3rd. Today's exchange market opened weak. The rate against the US dollar loosened by 0.375 to 3 pence and 0.875 yuan. The rate against the US dollar increased by 0.5 yuan to 7.5625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate was stable, remaining at 110 yuan. The unofficial price of "Joint Currency" was cheaper by 1.5 yuan, at 103 yuan.

### Cash Prices Fluctuated Before Stabilizing

Yesterday's unofficial cash market trend was erratic, generally falling sharply first and then rising sharply, ultimately showing no gains or losses, entirely dependent on the tightness or looseness of foreign exchange and shifts in buying and selling pressure. At the initial opening, due to the firmness of foreign exchange and the eagerness of securities firms to sell, coupled with hesitant buyers, there was a lack of support, and the price briefly fell to a low of 3,530 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange stopped loosening and recovered slightly, buying interest arose, and general scalpers rushed to absorb, so the price recovered to 3,585 yuan. At noon, as those who had profited that day cashed out at high prices, the price fell again, hovering around the 3,550 yuan mark. Afterwards, as foreign exchange returned to stability, buying interest revived, and a certain gold shop, acting on behalf of a South China group, absorbed quite a bit. In addition, speculators who had sold off returned to buy, and the market strengthened suddenly. By the evening closing, the price had recovered to as high as 3,600 yuan. The total volume of transactions throughout the day was small, about 700 to 800 taels. The price of jewelry gold in silver shops also initially fell and then recovered to flat. The prices of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable as before.

No Change in Raw Gold

Since the early morning opening of the first bar (10 taels), due to the firmness of foreign exchange and increased anxiety, buyers were cautious. At the opening, the price was sharply lowered by 40 yuan. A certain gold shop sold 10 taels to silver shop firms at 3,560 yuan. After the opening, securities firms vigorously sold off dozens of taels. Due to a lack of buyers, the price continued to weaken. At one point, the price even plummeted by 30 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to silver shop firms at 3,530 yuan, the lowest price of the day. At that time, a certain cash shop and a certain gold shop (acting on behalf of speculators) seized the opportunity to absorb at low prices, recovering the price by 30 yuan. A certain cash shop bought 30 taels from a money exchange business at 3,560 yuan. After this, as foreign exchange stopped loosening and recovered slightly, and securities firms also came to absorb, the price rose again by 25 yuan. A certain gold shop bought 10 taels from a money exchange business at 3,585 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop (acting on behalf of speculators) suddenly stopped buying, cashed out profits, and the money exchange business also came to sell off, so the market picture weakened again, falling by 35 yuan. Securities firms sold 20 taels to a money exchange business, priced at 3,550 yuan. At noon, securities firms again sold 20 taels to a certain silver shop for 3,552 yuan as the noon closing price. In the early afternoon, the market was still flat. First, a cash shop sold 10 taels to a money exchange business at 3,550 yuan. Then, securities firms sold 10 taels to a certain silver shop at 3,550 yuan. After this, a dramatic rising trend suddenly occurred, because the foreign exchange situation softened, and a certain gold shop, acting on behalf of a South China group, vigorously absorbed non-stop. In addition, the Jia Yi Gold Shop, acting on behalf of speculators, and securities firms also resumed buying interest, soaring by 55 yuan. Silver shop firms sold 50 taels to gold shops at 3,600 yuan as the evening closing price. It was heard that after the closing, there were buyers but no sellers at 3,605 yuan. As a result, there was no change compared to the previous day. The price difference throughout the day was 70 yuan. The selling price of cash shops' standard gold was 10 yuan higher based on raw gold prices. The current bidding gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there were few open transactions.

Jewelry Gold Initially Fell Slightly Before Recovering

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops: Initially, the Da Tong Hang still quoted 365 yuan. At 9:37, the price was lowered by 5 yuan. At 2:45 PM, the price recovered by 5 yuan. As a result, there was no change. The Da Tong Hang still quoted 365 yuan. The Xin Tong Hang quoted 363 yuan. The buying and selling prices were generally higher or lower by several yuan to ten yuan.

### Strong Demand for British and American Gold Tickets

Yesterday, foreign currency, British and American gold pounds, were in short supply, and the market was stable. Demand for gold tickets was very strong, and prices also rose. Hong Kong tickets were in short supply, and market prices rose slightly. Canadian and Philippine silver tickets were in strong demand, and inventories were scarce. Moreover, US dollar tickets were strong, following the uptrend. Japanese gold tickets resumed their downward trend, with the evening price at 1.05 yuan. Korean tickets were priced at 0.878 yuan in the evening market. Public Association transactions were very active. Rentai sold 1,500 yuan of Hong Kong tickets to Xiang Kang, and also sold 200 yuan of US dollar tickets to Qin Tai. Changtai also sold 200 yuan of US dollar tickets to Jin Tai. Yongfeng sold 200 yuan of US dollar tickets to Jin Da, and also sold 300 yuan of US dollar tickets to Qin Tai. Mao Feng sold 300 yuan of US dollar tickets to Chang Tai. Yesterday's market prices: British gold tickets rose by 0.3 yuan, US dollar tickets rose by 0.15 yuan, Hong Kong tickets rose by 0.01 yuan, Canadian tickets rose by 0.4 yuan, Philippine tickets rose by 0.3 yuan. The prices of other currencies remained unchanged.

### Fluctuations in Exchange and Discount Rates

Yesterday's exchange and discount rates for bills of exchange recovered and fell again. The rate initially broke through 200 yuan per thousand, hovering around 190 yuan. It then became unsustainable, falling to 175 yuan. At noon, it recovered again to 190 yuan. The afternoon trend was flat, eventually retreating slightly to 185 yuan, falling by 25 yuan compared to the previous day's final price. The interest rates of the Money Exchange Association remained unchanged, quoted at 0.2 yuan for both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Temporary Respite in the Rising Trend of Securities and Domestic Debt

Yesterday's unofficial securities market situation was high and then low. After rising for five consecutive days, the trend finally seemed to ease slightly. In terms of buying and selling, buyers initially continued to absorb, with Da Feng buying the most of Class A shares. Yi Zhong and Song Mao also had strong appetites. Class C shares were raised to 44 yuan, and Da Feng then sold off Class C shares. Issues No. 20, 35, and 64 were supplied extremely heavily. The prices of Class B and C shares plummeted by almost 1 yuan. At that time, there were very few buyers. Retail investors made slight compensations, while Fu Chun continued to sell off. There was no excitement at the closing, and the trend was likely to change. The market prices ultimately showed slight improvements of 0.2 to 0.4 yuan, except for Class B shares, which improved slightly by 0.015 yuan. The total volume of transactions was estimated to be about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below (London foreign debt market prices unchanged).

40 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded, priced at 8.35 yuan.

London British Far East Company Stock Market Prices on the 2nd of this month (Wednesday): HSBC Bank, London-registered shares fell by 0.5 pound, priced at 74 pounds; Hong Kong-registered shares rose by 0.5 pound, priced at 77 pounds; the rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Japanese Yarn Falls, Speculative Buying Subsides

The rising trend in the yarn market has subsided. Because the foundation of foreign exchange has become increasingly stable, speculative buying in the market has gradually subsided. However, the mindset of hoarders is still strong. If prices fall, they will still come to absorb and accumulate. As for actual demand, Chinese fabric buyers continue to purchase relentlessly. Given the current situation, unless there are unexpected changes, the yarn market may linger for a while. However, the Japanese yarn market has also turned downwards.

The spot yarn market opened flat this morning. Customers were also not urgently buying goods. In addition, the atmosphere was calm, and general trading activity decreased. Therefore, the opening prices were not much different from the previous day. 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods were priced at 587 yuan, and warehouse receipts were priced at 571 yuan. Soon, Hong Kong firms took some purchasing action, and the price of 20-count Special Golden City was still 690 yuan. The market was tight. Double Horse foreign warehouse goods were priced at 590 yuan, and warehouse receipts were priced at 574 yuan. Prices recovered slightly by 1 to 2 yuan at the closing. Yong'an Factory opened 80 bales of 20-count Special Golden City for 690 yuan and 10 bales of 10-count Special Golden City for 640 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 1,325 bales were traded, compared to 200 bales traded the previous day. Prices: 20-count Double Horse fell by 2 yuan, Shepherd fell by 1 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged. The amounts bought by various firms are listed on the left: Hong Kong 555, Fellow Traders 600, Mainland 170, Total 1325.

The Japanese yarn market has entered a flat and weak trend. Because of the consecutive days of rapid increases, there is a slight sign of reaction. This is also to be expected. The price of 20-count Yueqin for next month is 460 yuan, also falling quickly.

### Indian Cotton Firms Sell at Low Prices, Trading is Exceptionally Active

Transactions of native cotton are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Only Yuan Yihao bought 120 pieces. However, the Indian cotton business is developing more and more. Chinese merchants at Yong'an Factory are actively purchasing, totaling 1,600 pieces, all sold in cash by fellow traders. Xinsheng Yarn Factory also has an appetite. Mutual buying and selling among other fellow traders is still active, with most of the cotton being delivered to Japanese factories. Cotton prices are unusually firm and showing an upward trend. Market prices are more than 10 yuan cheaper than the prices directly ordered overseas from foreign firms. The firms are also seeking to sell at low prices due to cash flow and position reasons. There are only 65 bales of Tonghua cotton from northern Jiangsu. The current situation of spot cotton is recorded on the left.

A large batch of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai today. The British Company's "Jeypore" ship, loaded with 3,211 tons of cotton from Mumbai, about 10,000+ bales, is scheduled to arrive at the port at 7:00 AM today, scheduled to moor at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.

Another message: Although the trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has slightly improved recently, this raw cotton is limited to the goods in the hands of fellow traders, because their prices are still more than 20 yuan cheaper than the prices quoted by foreign firms. The main buyers recently are still Japanese manufacturers. Due to cash flow issues, the payment terms are all two weeks after delivery. Their inventory is low. It is said that the existing cotton is not enough for three or four weeks. If such transactions can be maintained for one week, all the goods in the hands of fellow traders will be absorbed. Then, the fellow traders will order from foreign firms at high prices. Therefore, according to this situation, there is still a day of prosperity for foreign cotton trading.

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market prices were more fatigued yesterday. The opening was still firm, but the reports from the cotton-growing regions suddenly reported well, and there was a lack of major buyers in the market. Washington Street selling was also very strong. Spot transactions in the South were quiet. Many long positions were cashed out by the traders, and it finally closed at the lowest price. As a result, it fell 8 to 10 points compared to the previous day. India also showed fatigue. Yesterday, including forecasts, it fell 1.5 rupees. Egypt rose 3 to 5 points.

### Cloth: Chinese Factories Busy Rushing to Deliver Orders

Yesterday, the situation was slightly more peaceful. Factories are gradually selling spot and this month's white cloth, totaling nearly 1,000 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth. Shenxin Factory's Fugui fine cloth opened at a price of 18.5 yuan. Thread tweed, serge, flannel, and grey cloth previously scheduled to be shipped are now being listed with higher prices. Shipping activities, factories are busy rushing to deliver orders. Dyeing factories have also resumed work one after another. Sales are most prosperous in Southeast Asia, Siam, Singapore and other places, purchasing over 10,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, floral cloth, and hemp yarn. Guangdong firms purchased over 4,000 bolts of colored serge and thread tweed. Many inexpensive orders are still being placed in this street. New goods are being sold at high prices, and buying interest has turned weak. However, dyeing factories purchased over 200 bales of colored cloth, colored twill, and cotton poplin grey cloth.

East Cloth: Yesterday, the white cloth market was really quiet, and selling prices returned to fatigue. The Longtou fine cloth was actively speculated, rising and falling suddenly. The highest price for this month was 16.89 yuan per bolt, and the low price fell to 16.5 yuan. The after-market rose again to 16.75 yuan. The futures price for next month is 17.2 yuan. Other fine cloths such as Yanghe, Wufu, and Laba Tong all fell uniformly by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan. The fine twill was relatively stable. Tianjin firms slightly sold some forward fine cloth. Dyeing factories in this street did not buy much, relying only on the minds of fellow traders to make a business. 600-700 pieces were traded, but the firm's opening price was still more expensive than the market price. Yi Shu ordered one hundred and several dozens of Longtou fine cloth for September, priced at 17.5 yuan.

### Food: Illicit Buying and Selling of Rice is Exceptionally Rampant, Transactions Reach More Than Double the Quantity of Rice in the Pot; Thick Rice, 23 Yuan

Du Rice: Because the store has been empty for a long time, purchases continue. However, to avoid price controls, there is no trading in the market. It is heard that there are many transactions outside the market, with thick rice priced at over 23 yuan and high-quality rice priced at 19 yuan. There have been no arrivals from below yesterday. 1,300-1,400 bags of wheeled buns came from Fengjing. People's hearts are high, and the market continues to rise. Where will it end? As for the transactions within the market, it is estimated that 16 yuan was charged for special quality rice, 16 yuan for rice, 22.5 yuan for variable rice, and 13 yuan for Hong Kong glutinous rice, totaling over 2,000 bags. The transactions outside the market are more than three times that of the market.

Ke Xian Rice: Yesterday's market was even more chaotic. The selling price of high-quality Ke Xian rice must exceed the limit by 2-3 yuan, and the price of medium and second-class rice increased by 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, or 0.8 yuan. High-quality rice must also exceed the limit by 0.4 or 0.5 yuan. Only second-class rice and brown rice are priced within 16 yuan. However, buying interest in this street is still greedy. The 17 yuan second-class Xian rice has been bought up in one go. The large market rice at 23 yuan is particularly active. The suppliers are unwilling to sell all the orders.

Flour: Retail transactions are active. Customer firms repeatedly requested factory prices based on exchange rates, but the factory refused to open exchange rate unified prices except for once offering a special price of 6 yuan for exchange rate, and the exchange rate increased or decreased, resulting in approximately 30,000+ bags being traded. The second plant's disk still required 5 yuan in cash, the difference between the goods and the factory's board was low by five cents to one cent.

Wheat: New wheat is arriving from the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways at a rate of 20-30 carts per day. Both China and Japan factories are thinking of taking it, but the purchasing power is very harsh. Yesterday, both Fuxin and Fufeng factories and hoarders were purchasing. The market tightened by a few cents to a few jiao. The factory purchased old Hunan, Luhe, Puzhen, and Wuxi wheat totaling 6-7 carts, priced at 6.6-6.7 yuan. In addition, hoarders purchased Nanjing, Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, Yongguan Dian, and other wheat totaling 11 carts, priced at 6.63-7.08 yuan.

### Sugar Market Cart White is Slightly Lower

Yesterday, according to London electricity, the sugar market fell again, with December at 6 shillings, March next year at 6 shillings 1 pence, and June at 6 shillings 1 pence 25. The city's association plan also saw a continued soft price, and the spot 24 crude white was slightly lower at 1 to 2 cent, the local warehouse was at 32.3 yuan, the foreign warehouse was at 32.1 yuan, the transit cargo was 500 bags, 24 yuan, and the old cargo was 23.7 yuan, 100 bags.

The local cotton white was slightly lower by half, the Zhenji No. 1 was at 32.5 yuan, and the No. 2, 3, and 4 were retired. The national sugar was still lacking continuous opening.

### Market News Roundup

Oil Market: Actual sales are stagnant, and the market has slightly reduced by 3-4 cents. 120 barrels of Dalian oil were opened throughout the day, and 160 barrels of Dalian oil and 10 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil arrived from Kobe. As for peanut oil, only a transit cargo of 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil was made.

Dried Lily Flower: Due to the inconvenience of transportation, Huaibei vegetables have been lacking in Shanghai for a long time. A customer tried dozens of bags that have arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, Ziji Dingzhuang vegetables were sold, priced at 50 yuan.

Hardware: Yesterday, Tianjin Yan and Qingdao Gang jointly searched for 500-600 bundles of plain white iron, so the standard market price returned high 0.4-0.5 yuan, such as the current sale price of 2.7 yuan per 36-foot sheet, and 3.25 yuan for 37-foot sheets.

Coal: Indian coal is again beneficial to Shanghai. The "Harlingen" managed by Jardine Matheson has transported 8,085 tons of coal from Calcutta, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon, moored at floats 33 and 34, waiting for unloading and transshipment. As for the Wen coal market, the price has risen to 5 yuan per load due to the lack of continued arrivals, and the firm will handle it themselves.

Camel Wool: Weilun Tiger picture is sold at 3.9 yuan per yard, Weiyi Shuanglu plain color is sold at 2.4 yuan for No. 1, 2.1 yuan for No. 2, striped No. 1 is 2.4 yuan, No. 2 is 1.85 yuan, and Fine Arts is 3.25 yuan, and all groups are making purchase.

### The Impossible "One Currency Plan"

— Xie Juhui

Because of the repeated decline in the foreign exchange black market and the increasingly severe fluctuations in the exchange market, the "One Currency Plan" editorial appeared in the North-China Daily News on July 22nd. It is said that many parties believe that now is the time for the Shanghai Municipal Council to start investigating ways to issue its own currency. The most noteworthy proposal is that the Shanghai Municipal Council should peg its currency to the British pound or the US dollar, using a small amount of circulation with the most complete management, as Hong Kong and Singapore are good examples. Although the exact level to which it should be pegged is still to be determined through broad consultation, the majority advocates that it should be pegged at a level higher than the current exchange rate, believing it should be set between eight pence and eight and a half pence. A currency committee should be organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the committee would be responsible to the Shanghai Municipal Council for managing the issuance of banknotes. Each yuan of banknotes must be backed by a 100% reserve of British gold or US dollars. For example, if issued at eight and a half pence, if a bank applies to the committee for 500,000 yuan in banknotes, it must deposit 17,708 pounds, 6 shillings, and 8 pence in British gold. If the market later feels that the supply of this banknote exceeds demand, the committee should redeem these 500,000 banknotes at eight pence, using 16,666 pounds, 13 shillings, and 4 pence in British gold. According to this method, this banknote has its own reserves, and most of the reserves can be freed up for investment, only needing to retain the usual reserve amount to cope with withdrawals. The conclusion is that if this move can get on track, it will benefit all parties for various reasons.

After this article was published, it immediately aroused the response of foreigners in Shanghai. English and French newspapers in the city have commented on it every day. A few days ago, the North-China Daily News further detailed the desire and welcome of all parties for this move in a prominent position. Some believe that it may be inconvenient for the Shanghai Municipal Council to do this, and it may be better for bankers to step in instead, and claim that if the Chinese government and others do not object, a major foreign bank in the city is prepared to consider issuing it. Therefore, this proposal is gradually tending towards implementation.

Therefore, from the standpoint of the citizens of Shanghai, we naturally cannot remain silent about this, and dare to write our opinions below.

First, we dare to say that the motivation for this proposal is only for the Shanghai Municipal Council and foreign firms to maintain a balance of payments, which does not seem to be worth making such a fuss about. Because in the same way that the burden on taxpayers or citizens is increased, why not be straightforward and quick, and imitate shipping companies in using Hong Kong dollars or other subsidiary coins to calculate taxes and utility costs, which is simpler. If it is really for the happiness of all Shanghai citizens, then the result of this move is probably the opposite of what is expected. It should be known that the current sharp contraction and chaos in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, the stagnation of the market, and the instability of social life are entirely due to the cessation of the supply of foreign exchange by the equalization fund, and various rumors have taken advantage of the opportunity, causing the public to doubt the legal tender. In that case, in order to seek the stability of the people's lives and the vitality of the market, the municipal authorities should be doing their best to maintain the credit of the legal tender, how can they add insult to injury and create a new currency to disrupt the market? More than two years have passed since the outbreak of the war, and the Chinese legal tender has not shown any signs of malicious expansion, which is an ironclad fact recognized by both Chinese and foreigners. Although the Chongqing side announced the other day that the recent issuance of the Central Agricultural Bank of China totaled 260 billion yuan, an increase of about 120 billion yuan compared with before the war, its gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves still accounted for 44%, which is still higher than other countries. Moreover, these newly issued legal tender are mostly circulating in the southwestern and northwestern provinces, replacing the provincial banknotes of the past, which is different from malicious expansion. As for the amount of legal tender circulating in Shanghai and other places, it is even more limited; and the implementation of the remittance system has further helped to tighten the legal tender. At the same time, if the decline in the foreign exchange black market is calculated according to the current market price, then the value of the gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves under the name of the legal tender is of course far more than 44%. All these facts show that the German mark and ruble during the European War cannot be used to compare with the Chinese legal tender. And the reason why the legal tender has reached the current state is entirely due to the imbalance of supply and demand, and the situation caused by the war. Not only because of the huge import surplus, but also for various other reasons, such as the successive issuance of "Joint Reserve Notes" and "Huaxing Notes", and the control of export trade in the occupied areas, and the interception of customs revenue, all of which have caused significant blows to the legal tender. If everyone can recognize this point, they will not doubt the legal tender!

Putting aside whether the Shanghai Municipal Council enjoys the right to issue currency under the land regulations, and whether this move violates the China policy of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries and undermines Chinese national law, judging from the effect of the Shanghai Municipal Council issuing banknotes alone, it is probably only equal to zero. Even if this banknote is backed by 100% foreign exchange reserves, if the holder cannot freely exchange it for foreign exchange, then what is the difference between the "Joint Reserve Notes", which nominally stand at one shilling and two pence, and the "Huaxing Notes" at six pence? At this time of market volatility, the Shanghai Municipal Council suddenly issuing a new currency should not imply to the citizens that the future of the legal tender is unpredictable, which will inevitably accelerate the flight of citizens' funds, and at the same time, the new currency will be calculated. The result of this move is that since it cannot be freely exchanged for foreign exchange, it will certainly not gain the trust of the citizens. As a result, the legal tender will suffer another blow, and the value of the new currency will not necessarily be stronger than the legal tender, only making the market more chaotic and the economy more devastated! Conversely, if this new currency is determined to be freely convertible to foreign exchange at a price of eight and a half pence, then in the current situation of rumors, the people's welcome of foreign exchange will certainly be greater than that of the new currency guaranteed by foreign exchange. Looking at the work of the equalization fund in the past few months, a capital of 10 million pounds is not enough to fill the insatiable desires of speculators and capital flighters, and how can the Shanghai Municipal Council's meager foreign exchange fund maintain this unchanged for a long time, who would believe this?

Taking a step back, assuming that this new currency is fully prepared, has a stable value, and is welcomed by all sectors of the city, then according to Gresham's law, it will immediately be absorbed and hoarded by all parties, and they will not be willing to use it. If the only currency circulating in the Shanghai market is still the legal tender, which is regarded as having "unstable value", then wouldn't the Shanghai Municipal Council be doing something unnecessary and wasting their time?

Some may say that the Hong Kong banknotes are stable at one shilling and three pence, and have stood firm until now, why can't the Shanghai Municipal Council do it? It should be known that the position of Hong Kong is different from that of Shanghai. First, its monetary system was established when the Chinese monetary system was stable; second, Hong Kong can be divided into an economic unit and isolated from China, while Shanghai is a major port of China, connected with the mainland, and even now, it is impossible to form an economic unit alone. Moreover, the Shanghai Municipal Council is only a municipal institution, and has no power to control or control customs, judiciary, administration, and finance, so how can it make its branch banknotes circulate unimpeded?

Therefore, our conclusion is that this is an impossible "one currency plan"!

### 400,000 Yuan of Stamps

— (Xin Meng)

How to Dispose of Fen Coins After Issuance

There is Already a Surplus in the Market, Small Vendors and Merchants Suffer Losses

Since copper fen coins disappeared from the Shanghai market, stamps have been used as a substitute in the absence of other options. Initially, various stamps such as one-fen, two-fen, and five-fen stamps were circulating in the market, and there was still a shortage, which made general merchants feel inconvenienced. However, soon the number of stamps circulating in the market increased day by day. After a short two months, not only was there no shortage, but stamps were everywhere, and there was already a surplus.

According to the statement released by the post office, there are currently 400,000 yuan of stamps circulating in the Shanghai market. We know that fen coins are being rushed into printing and will soon be circulating in the market. When fen coins are circulated, the discontinuation of stamps is inevitable, but how to dispose of these 400,000 yuan of stamps has become a major problem.

The author recently visited several stores in the neighborhood, both large and small, and they all said that they had accumulated a lot of stamps, a few yuan for small stores and dozens of yuan for large stores. Because of the increasing amount of stamps coming in and the small amount going out, most stores have adopted another method: stamps can be used for purchases under five fen, but for purchases over six fen, you must use jiao (ten-fen) notes, which is an expedient measure to remedy the excessive inflow of stamps.

At the same time, several stores, because they have accumulated a lot of stamps and have no way to get rid of them, and they are still coming in every day, have come up with another method: hanging a sign at the door saying "This store sells stamps at 105 fen per yuan". One yuan is 5 fen cheaper, although it can attract some owners and housewives who know how to calculate to exchange stamps, but the effect is not great, and it still cannot clear out the stamps. Therefore, some people are even willing to discount the stamps further, selling one yuan for 110 fen, and I heard that some even sell for 120 fen.

The small vendors in the vegetable market and the children selling newspapers, which one doesn't have a handful of loose stamps in their hands? These small vendors and small merchants do not accept stamps when buying rice, firewood, or wholesale goods. So when you go to buy newspapers or things, you will often be begged by people to give them jiao notes to change, and not to give them stamps.

Extending this to the small vendors in the alleyways and the handicraft workers, there is not one who does not have a matchbox full of stamps. They don't want to use them when they are dirty, and they are worthless when they are torn. Everyone feels a kind of pain and inconvenience with stamps, but if you don't accept stamps, you won't have any business, which is also inevitable.

Based on the above, the surplus of stamps in the cloth is an ironclad fact. How to dispose of 400,000 yuan of stamps in the market after the fen coins are circulated in the future, whether the post office will be accommodating and take them back, is indeed a question. Stamps are originally good for sending letters, but if they are used for sending letters, they cannot be used up in a short time; and some are dirty and will be rejected. Larger stores can still handle a few yuan of stamps without causing major problems, but small merchants and vendors, who earn money one day and spend it the next, cannot afford to have one yuan or a few jiao of stamps stuck in their hands, and maybe they won't even have capital left and can't do business anymore, so this problem is serious!

### Small Teacher's Cooperative

— Yi

Let's Cultivate This Little Life Together!

I would like to report on the general situation of the Small Teacher's Cooperative in this city after Mr. Langlang introduced the Silver and Money Industry Cooperative.

The Small Teacher's Cooperative was established seven months ago. It has more than 500 members and has a fairly tight organization. The articles of association stipulate that each share is one yuan of national currency, and each member can subscribe to a maximum of 20 shares. Moreover, regardless of the number of shares, each member has only one vote when electing. This can avoid the manipulation of large shareholders, which is very reasonable.

Because the members and business scope are limited to elementary schools, the society has set up a branch station in several central locations of the school in addition to setting up a general office. Each station has a station manager responsible for receiving and sending delivery orders and goods, and each district also has a main station for receiving and sending delivery orders and goods from each branch station. The general office has one staff member and several workers who are responsible for purchasing and distributing. In this way, although the delivery cannot be too quick due to the lack of staff, the workers of the general office will ride a bicycle to deliver the goods to you no later than 24 hours after the goods order is submitted.

So far, the Small Teacher's Cooperative has contacted more than 50 manufacturers or merchants and can get special treatment. Companies such as Gong Sheng Rice Shop, Guohua Coal Ball Company, China Chemical Industry Society, Family Industry Society, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Sino-French Pharmacy, China National Goods Company, and sweat shirt factories such as Zhenfeng, Wuhe, and Guohua have all expressed their sympathy and given special discounts. However, because the number of members is not enough and the financial resources are insufficient, all aspects have certainly not yet reached the ideal goal. From now on, on the one hand, we will rely on the efforts of the original members, and on the other hand, we will rely on the sympathy and assistance of people from all walks of life to cultivate this little life well.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 14: Fireworks Show Hometown Village Cooperation, Billowing Waves and Myriad Miles of Yinghai Aviation

It flies directly between Chongqing, China, and Alameda, carrying passengers and mail. Later, the Xinjiang region of China gradually prospered, and flights to Gansu, Chengdu, Shaanxi and other places became more frequent and connected with the Soviet Union. As for Central Asia, it is all high mountains and sandy plains, and China has no time to reach it for a while, so it has to let the Soviet Union develop air routes. Moreover, those long-range aircraft, in the first ten years, with a load of 100 tons and carrying 100 passengers, using six engines, everyone already felt very surprised. Who knew that in the past few years, aircraft with a load of 500 tons and carrying hundreds of passengers have been regarded as commonplace. Today, I will not talk about world aviation, but let’s talk about why He Liyu thought that starting this silk weaving factory must go to the United States. It is most important to investigate the fashion of foreign silk fabrics, and it is best to buy machines with someone who is knowledgeable. Moreover, she took the Pan American Pacific aircraft to go there. After the investigation in the United States, she can take the Atlantic aircraft from the United States to Europe. After traveling freely in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and other countries, she turned back to Paris, France, and took the China-France Airlines aircraft to return to Shanghai. It can take one month at most, or two weeks at least, and everything can be done comfortably. However, this matter, of course, must also be reported to her father. The third thing is about the start-up expenses for starting this silk weaving factory. With money, then you can do things, build houses, buy machines, rent land, recruit workers, everything needs money. Is this money still transferred from the north? Or is it drawn from the bank nearby? As far as Mr. He is concerned, his financial aspects are very active. There are several banks in Shanghai that have dealings with Mr. He. He also serves as a director of several private banks, such as Guangdong Bank and Overseas Chinese Bank. The people in the bank who know Mr. He also know his twin daughters. Moreover, when Mr. He left, he signed his checkbook and handed it to his two daughters. When they needed money, they just wrote the amount and went to the bank to withdraw it. But if these two daughters used a few thousand yuan, they could withdraw it without first informing their father. If they used tens of thousands of yuan, they must first ask for their father's instructions. Moreover, this silk weaving factory is a joint-stock company, and there are several shareholder uncles. How are their shares to be delivered? Or which bank will transfer them from? Will the shares be paid in full at once? Or will they be paid a certain amount first? All of this must be reported to their father. During the preparation period, it is best to hire an accountant. (167)

### A Public Letter to All Newspaper Readers

Dear Readers:

Our Association has been publishing articles in Shen Bao and other newspapers for a long time, and you must have seen them. Many people have written to ask questions, which shows that you are all paying attention! However, because of the limited space in the newspapers, the articles are always brief and not detailed enough. I am afraid that you do not understand them very well. Now there is a better opportunity, that is, starting from August 3rd in the Gregorian calendar, a sermon meeting will be held simultaneously in all large and small Christian churches in this city, starting at 7:30 every night. Anyone can go to listen. Please bring your relatives and friends to the nearest church to listen to the gospel of Jesus saving the world. If you have any questions to ask? You can ask the preachers face to face so that they can answer them at that time. This is a rare opportunity, so don't miss it. Text Evangelism Association, Postal Box 1227

### A Living Budget Table

— TC

The prices in Shanghai are soaring every day, which makes ordinary office workers cry out in pain. Not only do they have to maintain the lives of their families, but they also have to bear the education expenses of their children, the exchange of gifts, the addition of clothes..., it is really too hard to cope with. Therefore, recently, many people have taken risks because they cannot cope with life, and the weak, although gritting their teeth and using all their strength to struggle to barely maintain, are also at the end of their rope, a clever woman cannot cook without rice.

I have a relative who has a family of four: a husband and wife and two children. He is an office worker in a large company on Nanjing Road, with a monthly salary of 50 yuan; his wife is an elementary school teacher in a small school, with a monthly salary of 15 yuan. Their total income is 65 yuan per month. However, in Shanghai, where prices are soaring, it is not easy to support a family of four and bear all miscellaneous expenses with this, so they often feel the pain of not being able to make ends meet. In recent months, they have made a living budget table, and every month's expenses are paid according to the budget table, and they dare not neglect it at all. Now their family's life is not only stable, but also has a little surplus. It can be seen that the budget table is of great help to small office workers who are struggling to make ends meet. Now I will copy it below and introduce it to all the small office workers who feel that life is difficult. I hope that you will also make a budget table from today and pay according to it, and also get a happy life.

Income:

65 yuan

Expenditure:

Rent (room in a lane): 15 yuan

Food (two meals): 17 yuan (Editor's note: If it is two meals, lunch and dinner, it is definitely not so cheap; if it is one meal, how to solve the other meal?)

Other expenses: about 4 yuan.

Prepare for gifts: 4 yuan (surplus is accumulated to prepare for special circumstances).

Central Savings Society (quarterly subscription): 3 yuan (if you win a small or medium prize or the last number, it will be used to buy clothes and utensils, etc.)

Buy clothes (accumulated monthly): 7 yuan

Education expenses (accumulated monthly): 3 yuan

Movies (once a week, ticket price is between 15 and 33 fen)

Transportation expenses: about 4 yuan.

Total expenditure is 60 yuan, total income is 65 yuan

There is still 5 yuan left each month to make up for special circumstances.

### Beautiful Grasses and Ladies

Bai Hua

"The Lady's From Kentucky"

Produced by Paramount Pictures, Showing at Nanjing Grand Theater

Recently, I have seen many movies with horse racing as the theme. The motivation for making these types of movies, I guess, has the following points:

(1) In the vast horse farm, there are strong horses galloping. Due to the excellent photography conditions, very beautiful exterior scenes can be filmed. If color films such as "Fragrant Colt and Precious Horse" can be filmed, they will naturally be even more beautiful.

(2) The romance between men and women is the key to the victory or defeat of the final horse race, giving the audience stimulation in a tense atmosphere.

But the production skills of this "Beautiful Grasses and Ladies" are really too mediocre. There is neither a clear theme nor a tortuous and bizarre story. Even the romance that runs through this story is very forced.

The director's skills are also poor. It is not worth spending so much film to introduce Marty Black's appearance. The progress of the whole film is plain and dull. For example, Black secretly ordered his friend Moss to take "Reminson" (horse name) to participate in the competition. Although "Reminson" won the championship, he was young and extremely tired, and Penny hated Black for this. This is the most important key to this film, like a transition in writing an article, but the director also lightly let it go. The insertion of these two comical roles of Hub Herbert and Chai Su Xuci is also very stiff. In short, the director has only done his job of introducing the story.

George Rafford's Marty Black and Alan Qulu are average, because there is no acting to do.

### Mr. Xia Jingguan's Recent Works

### Poverty

— Xue Xin

Most "poor boys" are proud and arrogant, but those who talk about sorrow and bitterness are singing a high tune, a disgrace to poverty.

"Poor but not poor in ambition" is backbone, "poor in virtue and also poor in ambition" is boneless. "Poor to the extreme" and not writing "boring articles" of major and special works is ambitious and has personality.

If "exhausted and exposed ugliness", it is better to "pretend to be poor and protect oneself".

"Poor and fierce" and "poor and think hard" are "poor and indiscriminate".

"Poor though poor, there are still three loads of copper", not poor but making a fuss about poverty is "the stupidity of today".

"Poor but should be stronger" is "poor in people" not "poor in virtue", "old but should be stronger" is "encouraging old age" not "relying on old age".

"Poverty desires solidity", can you not consider its virtue. "Old horses turn back into young colts", can you not consider their future.

Compatriots, the plan of "do not pursue the poor enemy", except for those who abandon virtue, all can be pursued.

Random Notes on Artists

### Anecdotes and Reflections on My Film Career (Part 1)

— Recorded by Leng Fang

——A Conversation with Ms. Tan Ying

Editor's Note: Tan Ying has been in the film industry for many years and has a profound history. Her style is known for its romanticism, earning her the reputation of the "Oriental Garbo." In recent years, she has devoted herself to the arts, achieving even greater success. By reviewing her past experiences in the film industry, we can see that every successful actor has their own reasons for success. Her cinematic perspective, "Art is eternal," is also very practical and highly admirable.

I am also a standard film narrator; thinking about things from eight years ago is quite amusing.

During my school days, after finishing my homework every day, I was eager to go to the movies. I watched films at least twice a week. I was born somewhat neurotic, and my sensitivity seemed unusually keen. After watching each film, I would always quietly think and imitate the various expressions of Lillian Gish, Greta Garbo, and others. Sometimes, I would even wail to the sky, and tears would stream down my face. The next day at school, I would eagerly recount and act out the film I had seen the day before in front of many classmates, crying and laughing to my heart's content. Everyone watched with great interest and often said, "Ah Tan's expressions are really good; she will definitely be a movie star in the future." Who knew that I would actually end up making a living in the film industry? I find it extremely amusing!

Initially, at the age of seventeen, I happened to visit Mr. Dan Duyu's Shanghai Film Company to watch Ms. Ruan Lingyu filming "Yu Tang Chun." Mr. Dan saw me wearing a set of blue cloth children's clothes, jumping around, and said, "Wonderful! This big kid is so much fun!" Then he asked me, "Do you like making movies?" I said, "Making movies is what I like to do the most." The next day, I went to have photos taken and audition various poses and expressions. As a result, Mr. Dan was very satisfied. Soon after, he assigned me to star in a film called "A Lost Footing." Although it was my first time, the various expressions that seemed to come naturally, as if "without a teacher, self-taught," did not feel difficult at all. They praised me, saying that I had a great talent for acting. In reality, it was nothing more than a long-accumulated passion that I took the opportunity to unleash boldly. Looking back, it was really quite comical.

### Sun Yukun Strives to Improve

— Yan Yan

Indeed, Sun Yukun's decline is a great loss to the Wusheng (martial male) actors. He has an excellent foundation, and if he could strive for artistic achievement, his future would be limitless. It is a pity that he does not cherish himself and has gradually declined, which is why people feel sorry for him. He is the nephew of Yu Zhenting, the son of veteran actor Sun Dixiang, and a student of renowned teacher Fan Futai. Born into a Peking Opera family, he initially followed his uncle Yu Zhenting, hence the name "Little Zhenting." Later, he diligently studied Yang Xiaolou and became the most lifelike imitator of Yang Xiaolou among the rising stars. Some even praised him with the words "Sun Yukun is the successor to Yang Xiaolou's art." Logically, he should strive to improve, but his laziness is deeper than anyone else's, and he has gradually become disliked. Up until now, after experiencing many difficulties, he has realized his past mistakes. Therefore, he has given up all bad habits and is working hard every day. I heard that he is practicing martial arts in his private residence, preparing to strive to improve and form his own troupe after autumn. I hope he can realize his mistakes and turn back, as it is not too late to restore his former reputation. Otherwise, his life will indeed be over, and the Peking Opera world will lose a useful talent, which would be a pity.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden (Opera World)

Differences Between Inviting Actors Then and Now

There is another point: according to the rules of the past, anyone who was severely beaten for secretly luring away actors, resulting in serious injuries, would be at a disadvantage even if they went to court. And if things went badly, they might even be convicted of a crime and deported back to their hometown by the local government. Logically speaking, if someone secretly lures away the pillar of the troupe while the business is doing well and the opera is being performed successfully, the troupe would have to close down immediately. At that time, transportation was inconvenient, and it was usually too late to invite a new actor. However, the food and expenses for dozens of people backstage had to be provided as usual every day. Wouldn't the owner suffer a great loss? Therefore, at least the person who lured away the actor would be convicted of disrupting other people's business in an unruly and illegal manner. Moreover, the local magistrate would undoubtedly favor the people within his jurisdiction. Once he caught someone doing something wrong, he would definitely punish them severely. That is why I said earlier that anyone who came to lure away an actor had to be a tough guy, or it would be completely useless.

Given that luring away actors was so difficult as described above, how could it often happen that good actors eloped? It turns out that each industry has its own special means. Even if the owner takes strict precautions, as long as they are determined to lure someone away, they will eventually achieve their goal. It is impossible to guard against everything. When the person luring the actor first arrives, they still pretend to be a merchant. If they feel that their abilities are slightly lacking, they sometimes bring one or two helpers. After arriving at the destination, it is better to stay at the home of a local acquaintance if possible. Otherwise, they have to stay in a hotel. During the day, when there is nothing to do, they will find some buyers on the street for the inexpensive local products they brought with them, in order to conceal their intentions from the people in the hotel. In the afternoon or evening, when there is nothing to do, they will go to the theater to take a walk.
