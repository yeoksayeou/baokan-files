### Torrential Rains Cause Disaster, Turning Land into a Watery Realm; Japanese Offensive in Southeastern Shanxi Greatly Frustrated; Maintaining Transportation Lines Extremely Difficult for Japanese Mechanized Units; Chinese Forces in Southern Shanxi Fiercely Attack Xia County, Surrounding the County Seat

(Beiping) According to travelers arriving here from Shanxi, the Japanese offensive aimed at "purging" the entire southeastern region of Shanxi has been entirely submerged due to unusually heavy rainfall. At least two divisions of a certain Japanese army, using mechanized units to maintain transportation routes, are now finding it extremely difficult to maintain these routes, as the countryside has become a vast quagmire. The rain is continuing to fall, and guerrilla forces in the area are extremely active. It is widely believed that the Japanese army will suffer terrible losses or face the risk of running out of supplies. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Fancheng: In the area south of Tongbai and north of Sui County, heavy losses have resulted from days of chaotic fighting. The Japanese strategy of "divide and conquer," deploying units of three to five hundred infantry, artillery, and cavalry to encircle and attack the Chinese from multiple directions, has been met with fierce resistance from the resolute and brave Chinese defenders, resulting in numerous casualties. The Japanese army in Sui County even launched an offensive against the Chinese Lishan position with mechanized units, constantly bombing Chinese positions. The Chinese army, considering the positions of Gaocheng, Jiangjiahe, and Lishan completely destroyed and no longer defensible, withdrew yesterday afternoon to the new defense line of Huantan Town, Tangxianbo, and Wu'an, waiting for an opportunity to intercept the enemy. Currently, the Yaji River has been recaptured by the Chinese army, which is advancing south to flank the Japanese forces in the Jiangjiahe and Liujiahe areas. Chinese forces in the Dabie Mountains have established contact with the guerrillas in the Tongbai Mountains, launching a pincer attack against the Japanese. The Japanese army, venturing deep into the Wanshan Valley, will likely repeat the disaster of the Suizao campaign in May. (Dispatch, 6th)

(Chongqing) According to reports from Hubei reaching here, the Han River, one of the main tributaries of the Yangtze River, has recently experienced high water levels, greatly disadvantaging the Japanese. The Japanese army has been forced to build dikes in the areas of Duobaowan and Kongjiachang (transliteration). Two attempts by the Japanese to cross the river have reportedly failed. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)

Tongguan: Three to four thousand Japanese soldiers attacking from eastern Xia County have suffered heavy casualties from continuous attacks by the Chinese army. The Chinese army fought fiercely for a full day and night the day before yesterday, completely routing the Japanese. The majority of the Japanese forces fled towards Wenxi Anyun, while a portion retreated into Xia County. Xia County has now been surrounded by the Chinese and is under intense attack. (Dispatch, 6th)

Fancheng: The Japanese army reinforced with over a thousand soldiers on the 4th, attacking north of Huayangzi. The Chinese forces withdrew from Changshou Town, awaiting an opportunity to attack. (Dispatch, 5th)

Fengcheng: On the evening of the 4th, a small unit of a certain Chinese division launched an attack against the Japanese at Tianwangdu on the west bank of the Fu River. The Japanese were extremely panicked and, from the evening of the 4th to dawn on the 5th, blindly fired over two hundred artillery shells at the east bank of the Fu River, while simultaneously spraying machine-gun fire. By noon, the Chinese army had safely withdrawn to the east bank. Gunfire could still be heard from the west bank, demonstrating the extent of the Japanese fear of the Chinese. (Dispatch, 5th)

### Active Chinese Forces on the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Routes

Jinhua: The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have been repeatedly sabotaged by the Chinese, posing a great threat to the Japanese.

This is the second failed Japanese air raid on Kunming in the past two days, as a squadron of Japanese aircraft also came to attack the day before yesterday, but failed to achieve its objective due to adverse weather. Although Kunming is making every effort to evacuate residents, the population continues to increase. The pre-war population was 120,000, but it has now increased to 200,000. Last month, Kunming evacuated 2,033 residents, but 5,421 arrived, including 69 foreigners. The authorities anticipate that Kunming will be at risk of being bombed after the end of the two seasons at the end of September, and therefore plan to launch an evacuation campaign starting next week, encouraging residents to leave voluntarily. Catholic groups have already opened a first-aid hospital this week to prepare for future air raids. The hospital can accommodate 100 people and is currently serving as a clinic for the poor. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

(Fuzhou) At around 7:00 AM this morning, three Japanese aircraft flew into northern Fujian from Jiangxi, dropping six bombs on Jianyang, destroying over ten civilian houses.

All technical equipment has been moved to safe areas outside the city. On the day that the various newspapers resume publication, the "Chongqing United Daily" will cease publication. However, due to the high price of imported paper, all newspapers will no longer use newsprint but will instead use domestically produced earthen paper. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)

### University Presidents Appeal to Britain and America for Active Assistance to China; Request Suspension of Anglo-Japanese Tokyo Negotiations; Support for Chinese Legal Tender

(Chongqing) Chinese university presidents today jointly telegraphed the President of Oxford University in the United Kingdom, requesting that he forward the appeal to leaders and the public of the British education community, urging the British government to suspend the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo and to provide all possible assistance to China, including support for Chinese legal tender. Furthermore, the Lanzhou branch of the International Peace Movement today also telegraphed Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, making the same appeal. However, this telegram also urged the British government to abolish trade with Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

(Chongqing) The presidents of sixteen major Chinese universities yesterday jointly telegraphed Nicholas Murray Butler, the President of Columbia University in the United States, requesting that the United States take more concrete measures, such as prohibiting the supply of military materials to Japan and providing active financial or other assistance to China. At the same time, the university presidents also telegraphed the President of Oxford University in the United Kingdom, requesting that he advise the British government to abandon the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. In addition to being sent to the presidents of Columbia University in the United States and Oxford University in the United Kingdom, these joint telegrams were also sent to the presidents of other universities in the United Kingdom and the United States through the presidents of the two universities. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)

(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily published an editorial this morning urging Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to conclude an anti-aggression pact as soon as possible, stating that although the negotiations in Moscow will directly affect the situation in Europe, they will also have an important indirect impact on the situation in the Far East. If the three-nation anti-aggression pact is completed soon, the European situation will be temporarily eased, and Britain and France will be able to shift their focus to the Far East. At the same time, Japan will no longer be able to use the pressure of Germany and Italy in Europe to coerce Britain and France in China. The newspaper also stated that even if the content of the three-nation pact does not include the Far East, the spirit of cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will inevitably extend to the Far East, and collective security in the Pacific will be rapidly realized as a result. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

(Chongqing) According to well-informed Chinese sources here, the general public in China is quite skeptical about the possibility of Japan joining the German-Italian military alliance. They believe that the announcement made by Japan after the recent meeting between the German and Italian ambassadors is merely a form of threat intended to exert pressure on democratic countries, particularly Britain. Since the United States announced the abolition of the treaty, the attitude of the United Kingdom at the Tokyo conference has gradually become firmer, and military representatives from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will soon hold staff talks in Moscow. Therefore, Japan now wants to use the possibility of joining the Axis military alliance to force Britain to make concessions and adopt a more conciliatory attitude at the Tokyo conference. Japan is already experiencing considerable difficulties in the war against China and is unwilling to attempt to become involved in a European conflict in which it has no interest.

Editorial

### Islam and the War of Resistance

A Reuters dispatch recently reported that the China Islamic National Salvation Association held its annual meeting in Chongqing. President Chiang Kai-shek personally attended and delivered a speech, praising Islam's love of justice and the great fearless spirit of defending the truth. This is certainly welcome news to Muslims. Unfortunately, the report was not detailed enough, so I would like to add a few words.

Islam has been transmitted to China for over a thousand years, and there are about 50 million converts. Throughout the generations, there have been many outstanding figures who have made many contributions to politics and culture. Even just considering the correction of the calendar, its contributions are everlasting, but few know that this is due to Islam. This is because the Islamic spirit values sincerity and modesty and does not like to publicize itself. Therefore, its history is said not to be short. The number of believers is not said to be small, but few outside the religion understand it. They only know that it prohibits pork. Islam is indeed one of the great religions of the world. If its teachings were only about this simple prohibition, with no special spirit to maintain it, it would not be so great and could not make people sincerely turn to it and make it last so long! President Chiang's praise has its basis and is not accidental. The spirit of resistance in China today is consistent with Islamic teachings.

The name "Islam" only exists in China. Everywhere else in the world, it is called "Islam." "Islam" means the religion of peace; the original meaning of the word is peace, the way to peace. The teachings of "Islam" are to completely obey the commands of God and not to offend people, so as to achieve peace. Therefore, in the Islamic "Quran," God is called the Lord of Peace: its main purpose is to encourage believers to develop their noble and beautiful abilities and to maintain peace in the world. According to Islamic classics, God revealed to the Holy Prophet Muhammad, who transmitted it to the believers; the goal is to correct the mind, cultivate the body, and save the world. The active aspects include doing all kinds of good deeds, and the passive aspects include refraining from all kinds of evil. Belief must be firm, and practice must be firm, without sloppiness or pretense, in order to nip evil in the bud; therefore, even if non-Muslims prepare food other than pork, it is not touched. Its rules are strict and do not allow for any deviation, such as not marrying outside the religion, praying five times a day from morning to evening, fasting for one month every year, and making a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca once in a lifetime. After death, one must be buried within three days, without clothes or coffins, wrapped in plain silk and covered with a bottomless outer coffin, so that the body is in direct contact with the earth, so as to seek quick decay. All of this is a glimpse of the Islamic spirit, which must be followed by believers, but the special spirit of Islam lies elsewhere.

What is the special spirit of Islam? It is that all believers are of one heart, forgetting their own interests because of their strong faith in God. Muslims recognize that there is a great power in the universe that created heaven and earth, nurtured all things, and is great in benevolence and compassion, perfect in virtue and omnipotence, without form or place, called "Allah" (in Arabic), which translates as God. Man's destiny is predetermined by Him, and man's good and evil are judged and rewarded by Him. Life on earth is for serving this one and only God. Therefore, our bodies and lives are not our own, but are given by God to those who practice the Great Way. Our assets are also not our own, but are given by God to those who relieve the poor and benefit others. We must do our best to fulfill what God has revealed to us; even if we lose our bodies, our lives, or our assets, we will not regret it. Belief and practice must be united. Belief without practice is just a formality. It must be reflected in action to be true belief. Thomas Carlyle, a famous British historian, once called this "refusing self" and "annihilating self" in the chapter on "Islam" in his book "Heroes and Hero Worship."

Since Muslims sacrifice "self," they see all mankind as equal under God's rule and should be treated fairly. Even slaves should not be subjected to violence or unreasonableness. For this reason, Muslims view aggression and bullying as the public enemy of mankind, as not allowed by religious teachings, and regard stopping violence as an obligation to God. Aggression and violence violate the essence of "Islam." If they are allowed to run rampant without being punished, God's Great Way will be destroyed, and people's lives will be disturbed. Believers must not cherish their own lives and money in order to eliminate violence and maintain peace, but must all go to the great righteousness in order to achieve great integrity. President Chiang's praise of Islam for its love of justice and its great fearless spirit of defending the truth is the ultimate statement of understanding of Islam. In the "Quran," there is a warning to its believers:

"Do not say that those who die in the cause of God are dead, but they are alive, but you do not perceive it."

"Fight against those who fight you in order to defend the Great Way; do not transgress. Indeed, God does not love transgressors. Kill the enemy whenever you encounter them, and drive them out to restore your former residence. The poison of persecution is worse than being killed. Under the forbidden court (the Heavenly Gate of Mecca), do not fight unless the enemy strikes first; if they fight you, then you may kill them; that is the retribution of the rebels. If they stop, then stop. God is most forgiving and most merciful. Fight the enemy until persecution ceases and the Way returns to truth. Once they have stopped, do not hate them, but only hate those who abuse them... Recreate as they created you!"

"Spend your wealth to defend the Great Way, and do not bring about your own destruction with your own hands."

"Fight in the cause of God, knowing that God is all-hearing and all-knowing. Whoever makes a good contribution to God, God will reward him richly, and God will receive him greatly."

"Why do you not fight in the cause of God and to save the weak men, women, and children!"

"Even if you are wounded in battle, the enemy will not be spared from injury... God will only distinguish His Muslims (those who believe in the Way) in order to reward those who have contributed to martyrdom; if you encounter danger on the expedition, do not be discouraged, do not be afraid, do not submit, and God will surely reward those who can endure!"

There are many more such admonitions in the "Quran," which need not be listed exhaustively. This kind of spirit is impossible to find in other religions. If everyone could adhere to these precepts and put them into practice, there would be no one in the world who would dare to rely on strength to bully the weak in order to satisfy their ambitions; there would be no one who would be willing to endure humiliation and live as a slave; how could peace and order not be maintained! From this, we know that in the past, Muhammad fought hard with his bare hands, and in less than twenty years, he created an unprecedented great cause in the world. He and his followers had this great fearless spirit, which was the basis of his success. After the end of the European War, Turkey was in a slump, and strong enemies were pressing in, almost leading to its demise; then General Kemal Atatürk raised his arms and called out, and the whole country responded. Not only did he preserve the devastated land, but he has now regained his status as a powerful nation in the world. He is indeed an Islamic country. In today's China, General Bai Chongxi is indeed an outstanding example of this spirit.

The world's commentators often criticize Islam for this; they also say that Muhammad preached with "the Quran in his left hand and the sword in his right." But this is not a fault, the fault lies in seeing the sword but not the Quran. Some also belittle Islam because of its rituals and customs, but their views are truly shallow; however, the friction between Muslims and non-Muslims caused by this belittling must be guided and eliminated, and cannot be ignored because of its shallowness. People like Carlyle, with the torch-like eyes of a historian, saw through the truth of Islam and praised it without the slightest disparagement; and like the Japanese Kato Jibuchi, in his book "History of World Religions," praised Islam as a religion suitable for modern times; this kind of view is not only beneficial to Islam.

China has 50 million Muslims, and they are distributed in the southwest, mostly, and in the northwest, densely. The southwest and northwest are the basis for China's war of resistance. With 50 million people upholding Islam, the contribution to the war of resistance will be immeasurably great, which we firmly believe. It should be known that the powerful also know what to fear, using names and rituals to deceive, building churches, and enticing believers, trying to control them and make them do their bidding; there have been frequent reports of this kind of news recently. This is not allowed by religious teachings, but it can also be used to prove the greatness of Islam, which is feared and coveted. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the believers will be able to promote their teachings in a timely manner, that those outside the religion will respect their teachings, and that they will be as harmonious as water and milk, moving forward hand in hand on the road of resistance and reconstruction, so that Islam's contribution to the country will not be just the strength of 50 million people.

### Britain and America Consider Dispatching Fleets to the Far East, Concentrating in Hawaii and Singapore Respectively, to Jointly Blockade Japan When Necessary

(Washington) According to reports, President Roosevelt has decided to dispatch all or part of the U.S. fleet to the Hawaiian Islands as a warning to Japan. Reliable sources believe that this move will not be implemented immediately, but it is sufficient to indicate that President Roosevelt intends to take a stronger policy toward Japan during the congressional recess. The State Department stated that it had no comment on the President's plan to dispatch the fleet to the Hawaiian Islands. The early return of the fleet from various ports in the Atlantic to the Pacific was regarded as a warning from the United States to Japan, indicating that the United States was closely watching Japan's rights and interests in the Far East. Observers said that since that time, the situation in China has not improved, and there have been countless incidents of American people being insulted and attacked by Japanese troops. The State Department has repeatedly expressed concern about the situation in China in the past week. The United States has protested to Japan in Tokyo and China against Japan's instigation of an anti-British movement, fearing that it may expand to include an anti-American movement. Thirty-five American churches have been destroyed by Japanese aircraft in the past five months. Although the news of dispatching the fleet to the Hawaiian Islands has not been confirmed, military experts believe that the United States has been making military preparations in strategically important locations along the Pacific coast in recent months. President Roosevelt's plan to dispatch all or part of the fleet to Hawaii was reported after British Prime Minister Chamberlain warned Japan that it was not impossible for Britain to dispatch a fleet to the Far East that was superior to the Japanese navy. Some believe that if Britain decides to dispatch a fleet to the Far East, President Roosevelt will take parallel action, at least dispatching the U.S. fleet to the Hawaiian Islands. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)

(Washington) The forceful circles here were deeply moved by British Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement to the House of Commons on Friday that Britain intends to take naval action to deal with Japan's intimidation. It is widely believed that Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech indicated the depth of British resentment against Japan and that Britain will adopt a stronger attitude toward Japan. This trend is influenced by Washington's abolition of the 1911 U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty. Some were shocked that Britain made a threat to dispatch a fleet to the Far East at a time when the situation in Europe was tense. Naval experts said that the German navy only accounted for one-third of the British navy's strength, while the French navy was on par with Italy's, so it was no problem for Britain to dispatch most of its fleet to the Far East if necessary. Military circles said that Britain had long studied the action of the British fleet using Singapore as a base and the U.S. fleet using Hawaii as a base to jointly blockade Japan. This action may not require war and could immediately cut off Japan's main supplies, causing Japan to change its policies. Some observers believe that Prime Minister Chamberlain's threat that Britain was considering dispatching the navy to the Far East already contained this meaning, and that President Roosevelt's decision to dispatch all or part of the U.S. fleet to Hawaii was viewed in the same way. Japan's continued insults have caused not only the abolition of the treaty, but also the U.S. public is ready to take stronger action, or jointly blockade Japan with Britain. Currently, the general view is to impose an arms embargo on Japan to determine whether this action can cause Japan to change its current policies. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)

### Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces Announce Downing of Multiple Japanese Aircraft; Japanese-Manchukuoan Forces Repeatedly Repelled in Attacks; Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces Remain East of the Khalkhin Gol River

(Moscow) The General Staff of the Soviet-Mongolian forces in Outer Mongolia recently issued a communiqué stating that from July 26th to August 4th, the Japanese-Manchukuoan forces launched repeated attacks, all of which were heavily damaged and repelled by the Soviet-Mongolian forces using artillery and machine guns. They maintained their original positions on the east bank of the Khalkhin Gol River. During the same period, multiple air battles occurred, resulting in the destruction of sixty-seven Japanese-Manchukuoan aircraft, while the Soviet-Mongolian side only lost six. (1) On July 28th, five Japanese-Manchukuoan aircraft were shot down, with no losses on the Soviet-Mongolian side. (2) On July 29th, several air battles took place over Outer Mongolian territory, resulting in thirty-two Japanese-Manchukuoan aircraft being shot down, while the Soviet-Mongolian side only lost four. (3) On July 31st, five Japanese-Manchukuoan fighter planes were shot down, with the Soviet-Mongolian air force losing one. (4) On August 1st, Japanese-Manchukuoan bombers invaded Outer Mongolian airspace. The Soviet-Mongolian forces immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns and dispatched fighter planes to engage. The Japanese-Manchukuoan side lost two aircraft, with the rest fleeing. One Soviet-Mongolian air force pilot sustained minor injuries. In the afternoon of the same day, Japanese-Manchukuoan bombers attempted to bomb Soviet-Mongolian positions again, but were repelled by anti-aircraft artillery and fighter planes. (5) At 8:00 PM on August 2nd, several Soviet-Mongolian bombers flew to the enemy side and bombed their airfield, safely returning to their base after destroying three enemy aircraft. (6) On August 3rd, Japanese-Manchukuoan bombers, under fighter escort, attempted to drop bombs on the Soviet-Mongolian forces, but were repelled by the Soviet-Mongolian air force, which destroyed two of their bombers. (7) On August 4th, two more air battles occurred over Outer Mongolian territory, resulting in ten Japanese-Manchukuoan aircraft being shot down, while the Soviet-Mongolian side only lost one.

### Anglo-Japanese Negotiations Stalled for Several Days; Japan Issues Threatening Statement; Saying Further Delays Will Lead to Intensified Anti-British Movement; London Times Explains Ground for British Warning to Japan

(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers today prominently published Chamberlain's speech, but without any criticism so far. It is reported that representatives of the Tianjin Japanese authorities participating in the Tokyo conference have developed "an unpleasant impression" regarding Halifax's speech in the House of Lords. According to them, the British Foreign Secretary's speech showed British infidelity and slandered the spirit of compromise between Arita and Craigie. The British representatives have not received instructions from their government, so the Anglo-Japanese conference has been stalled for four days, with no immediate prospect of resumption. Britain is deliberately delaying for its own convenience, which shows its infidelity. If Britain continues with this delaying tactic, the Japanese military authorities will inevitably take countermeasures to deal with the new situation two days later. Halifax's statement that banning the anti-British movement in North China has become an important factor in the progress of the Tokyo conference, and that the Japanese military is responsible for suppressing the anti-British movement in North China, is completely contrary to the facts. Because Britain has always adhered to a pro-Chiang policy, refusing to hand over Chinese-owned silver deposits, refusing to ban the circulation of legal tender in the British concession in Tianjin, and disturbing the peaceful order and economic situation of the people in North China, and actions that harm the interests of the people of North China, it should bear all the responsibility for the anti-British movement that is now spreading in North China. If Britain abandons its policy of hostility towards the people of North China and corrects its attitude towards the police and economic problems in North China, the anti-British clamor in North China will naturally disappear. Therefore, Britain should bear full responsibility for the current anti-British movement in North China. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

(London) After Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, issuing a warning to Japan, The Sunday Times recently published an editorial commenting on it, saying, "At this moment, the most pressing diplomatic issue is the problem constituted by Japan. Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons before the adjournment is focused on this, and its nature is a clear warning, not a threat to Japan. Even a politician as moderate and cautious in his speech as Chamberlain has stated that the insults suffered by British nationals at the hands of Japanese soldiers have made his blood boil, and that while the British naval fleet in the Far East is not as powerful as Japan's, it may be possible to send the fleet to the Far East under certain circumstances. Japanese politicians who still know how to weigh the pros and cons must listen, otherwise it is unwise. What is regrettable is that the Japanese military in China are too excited, not only are they not controlled by the Tokyo government, but their momentum is enough to control the moderates, and even the moderates are in constant fear of being assassinated by the extremists. This situation is unique to Japan, which shows that the country's foreign policy is at risk of going off the rails at any time." (Havas dispatch, 5th)

### Demonstrators in Anti-British Movement Chant Anti-American Slogans; Denouncing U.S. President's Abolition of Trade Treaty; Anti-British Slogans Fill Streets of Beiping

(Beiping) News received here today indicates that the anti-British movement in North China has now turned against the Americans. During demonstrations in Shijiazhuang, anti-American slogans were chanted and anti-American speeches were delivered. The demonstrators denounced U.S. President Roosevelt's action of abolishing the U.S.-Japan trade treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

(Beiping) The anti-British movement in Beiping has become rampant again. New slogans denouncing Britain have been posted in the city. Slogans have been found in all public places, such as public organizations, and in Chang'an Street there are many. Even on the trunks of trees and telephone poles in the Dongjiaominxiang area, hundreds of these slogans have been pasted. Some are written in English, such as "Oppose Britain" and "Exclude Britain," while those written in Chinese have a stronger literary flavor, such as "Down with Britain's malicious aggression," "Down with Britain's malicious imperialist policy," "To liberate the Chinese nation, we must first overthrow Britain," "Asia is for Asians," and "Aspiring yellow people will not be British slaves," etc. However, the general public is not very interested in these slogans. Some slogans have been torn down. According to those who have traveled to Beidaihe, there is no real progress in the anti-British movement there. The committee organizing the movement went to various shops in the town and forced them to send one representative to participate in the mass anti-British rally. Otherwise, they would pay one yuan. Most shops paid it, and the committee used the money to hire people to participate in the rally. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

(Beiping) According to an American businessman who arrived here from Shijiazhuang, British expatriates in Shijiazhuang said that after U.S. President Roosevelt announced the abolition of the trade treaty with Japan, an anti-American movement broke out there. However, there were no Americans in Shijiazhuang at the time, so no unfortunate incidents occurred. Not many people participated in the anti-American movement, and they all carried various flags with anti-American slogans. According to the traveler, in the middle of July, the anti-British demonstrations in Shijiazhuang were even more serious than the anti-American movement. The children of the British clergyman Outremon were almost innocently injured. According to people from Taiyuan, the British expatriates who were planning to retreat are still staying there, apparently because railway traffic is blocked by floods, so they have to delay slightly. Also, it is reported that 260 Chinese parishioners of the Taiyuan Baptist Church were arrested by the Japanese. Of these, the Japanese accused 16 of organizing anti-Japanese activities and detained them, while the others have been released. Also, under the instigation of the Japanese, the Beiping "Municipal Government" is now planning to eradicate British educational influence in North China and is warning Chinese parents to withdraw their children from schools run by the British. However, there is a severe lack of schools outside, so it is extremely difficult. At the same time, British clergymen here have now received warnings to stop their missionary work. Those who continue to work in churches or church schools have also received warnings not to take actions that hinder the peace of North China. Police officers still visit the servants in British homes every day, urging them to leave as soon as possible. According to a Japanese military spokesman, there are at least 35,000 Chinese guerrillas linked to the British. Of these, 1,000 were killed and 100 captured by the Japanese in July after being swept away. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)

### Northern Route慰勞團 [Comfort Mission] Performs Flag Presentation Ceremony

A certain place in Northern Hubei. The Northern Route Comfort Mission held a flag presentation ceremony to all the officers and soldiers of the 某 War Zone by the Han River at 5:00 PM this afternoon. More than 3,000 representatives from all walks of life, including Commander-in-Chief 口, attended.

### Heavy Rains in North China; Disaster Signs Already Formed

(Beiping) According to news here today, the floods caused by the recent heavy rains in North China have destroyed most of the crops. It is estimated that the flooded area covers 60 counties in Hebei, 15 counties in Henan, 6 counties in Shandong, and 10 counties in Chahar. The number of lives lost is quite large. The recently repaired northern section of the Pinghan Railway is again threatened by the collapse of twelve sections of the Yongding River embankment. The water depth in Changxindian reaches 20 feet. Many residents in many places have been forced to flee to higher ground, but they have not brought enough food, and some have brought no food at all, so they are in danger of starving to death. At the same time, the incidence of epidemics is increasing day by day. In Tongzhou, 500 of the 2,600 refugees have malaria, and food is extremely scarce. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)

### Tianjin's Food Situation Worsens

(Tianjin) The food situation here is getting worse. This morning, the British Concession菜市 [Vegetable Market] only had a few dried slices of sweet potato, some cabbages that seemed to be rotten, and some leftover food. The asking price is almost unimaginable. No fish or meat is for sale. According to the vendors, the source has been cut off and they have to close their businesses. Milk and other牧場 [pasture] products are extremely rare. Lodging houses and small private restaurants have notified their customers that they can no longer provide meals. The supply of flour and rice in the British Concession is still sufficient. The situation in the French Concession菜市 is better because they have agreed with the Japanese authorities to allow five trucks to transport vegetables in every day. However, due to the butcher's strike, no meat is available. Some plan to buy food in the former German Concession, but it is extremely difficult to bring a small amount into the British Concession, so most people do not consider it. The British Concession currently has some canned food, but this comes from abroad and is very expensive due to foreign exchange, so it is not affordable for ordinary families.

### Germany Unwilling to Rush into Conflict; Danzig Situation Temporarily Eases; Regarding the Treatment of Polish Customs Officers; City Council Makes Concessions to Polish Government

Warsaw. Regarding the issue of the treatment of Polish customs officials in the free city of Danzig, the Polish government instructed its High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, last night to lodge a protest with the city council, demanding the revocation of the decree. The wording was extremely strong, and a reply was demanded within today. Sources here claim that the city council agreed to comply this morning and will submit a detailed reply next week. The Polish government replied that it hoped that the city council could satisfy Poland's demands. Authoritative observers here commented that the Danzig city council was fortunate to have made concessions, otherwise an armed conflict between Poland and Germany would have been almost inevitable. The details of the issue and the Polish government's 美教書 [ultimatum] are as follows:

Customs Officer Treatment Issue

Negotiation Process

On the 4th of this month, the Danzig City Council declared that it would only recognize the Polish customs officials belonging to the Polish Ministry of Finance and allow them to exercise their functions, while all those belonging to the Polish military authorities would be regarded as "border customs officials" and ordered to cease serving from noon on August 6th. If they resisted, they would be expelled and force would be used if necessary. Upon hearing this news, the Polish government instructed Chodacki to submit a note to the chairman of the city council, Greiser, last night. The main points were three: (1) Demand the revocation of the decree. (2) Demand a reply within today. (3) Declare that all Polish customs officials belonging to the military authorities have been instructed that if they are obstructed in the performance of their duties, they may use weapons. This morning, Greiser submitted a verbal reply to Chodacki, stating that the measures intended to be taken against the Polish customs officials were decided by lower-level officials and that the Free City authorities did not intend to implement them. Therefore, the service of all Polish customs officials would still be treated equally and not hindered. A detailed report will be submitted next Sunday, explaining the views of the Free City authorities on the general issues constituted by the customs officials. The crisis was thus temporarily calmed. People in political circles said that Poland is determined to maintain its right to manage the Danzig customs by all means. Although the city authorities have made concessions, the crisis has not disappeared. Germany is determined to have its way on the Danzig issue, the only question is when. Poland is determined to defend its rights and will not allow Danzig to be annexed by Germany. However, various friendly solutions that can be accepted by both sides are also prepared for discussion. It can be seen that the positions of both sides have not changed. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Britain Will Not Sit Idly By

German Violent Actions

(London) The Danzig issue and Germany's military preparations have been commented on by various newspapers, all saying that Britain will not sit idly by and watch Germany take any violent action. The Observer newspaper published a dispatch from its Warsaw correspondent, stating that [the Danzig issue has gradually become tense since last week, causing panic in Warsaw today. It is believed that the situation is approaching a breaking point. Diplomats from various countries have also canceled their vacations and stayed in Warsaw. This morning, it was also heard that German National Socialists in Danzig planned to kidnap several Polish customs officials at the border between the city and East Prussia. However, after receiving orders from Berlin and consulting with the leader of the National Socialists in Danzig and the German military commander, they did not take any action. The city council also made concessions to Poland. However, spokespersons for the Polish government believe that the statement issued by London is "overly optimistic" in content. In fact, the crisis has not been eliminated. The Polish military authorities have taken various measures to prepare for the worst.] (Havas dispatch, 5th)

(London) British Foreign Office personnel were busy all day yesterday due to the dispute between Poland and Danzig. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax, although on vacation, never stopped talking on the phone. News came in the afternoon that the situation had eased, and many believed that the crisis had been temporarily avoided. It is widely believed that Danzig's retreat was purely because Germany did not want to start a conflict this week, as mobilization has not yet been completed. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)

German Mechanized Forces

To Hold Large-Scale Maneuvers

(Berlin) South of Berlin along the Elbe River, unprecedented large-scale maneuvers of mechanized forces will begin next week. Although its detailed deployment is still kept secret, its preparations show that this is a trial mobilization of mechanized forces. The requisition of cars and the lack of gasoline are now causing residents anxiety, as it is feared that car fuel will be entirely controlled by government officials. As Germany's military strength has approached its highest level of preparedness, anti-Polish propaganda has suddenly been moved to the front pages of newspapers. Important positions in each newspaper are filled with news of Poland's abuse of the German minority. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Polish Government Denies

Issuing Army Mobilization Order

Warsaw. The semi-official agency, Pat, has been authorized by the government to deny the rumor that the Polish army has been mobilized by the government, saying that the Polish army has not continued to mobilize since the partial mobilization in March this year. All rumors are unfounded. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Warsaw. In view of the German army's assembly outside of southern and western Poland, Poland is still mobilizing, with new recruits being called up every few days. Mobilization will reach its highest level in the second half of this month. According to Polish newspapers, Germany's military preparations are actively underway on a large scale, and the situation is tense. Therefore, Poland urged its allies not to slacken their vigilance. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

It is said that a fire broke out at the time, but it was extinguished by the fire brigade and did not burn down. The German side claimed that this was done by Poles, but the Polish side denied it.

### Polish Restoration Anniversary: Army Inspector-General's Speech: Respond to Violence with Violence, Determined Not to Abandon International Obligations, Swearing an Oath to Struggle for National Prestige

Krakow, Poland - Previously, at the beginning of the European War in 1914, the Polish national hero, the late Minister of Military Affairs, General Piłsudski, organized volunteer troops to join the Austrian army and fight against Russia, and in return, the two countries of Germany and Austria recognized Polish independence. Later, after the end of the European War, the plan for the restoration of the country was completed. Today is the 25th anniversary of the departure of the first group of volunteers from this city. Army Inspector-General, General Śmigły-Rydz, personally presided over the ceremony and delivered an important speech, the main points of which are as follows: 1. Respond to violence with violence. 2. Poland has no intention of aggression, but all aggressions, whether direct or indirect, must be resisted. 3. The Free City of Danzig is the economic lifeline of Poland and must be safeguarded. The gist of his speech is recorded as follows: "August 6th is the starting point of our country's independence, and also a new page in our country's history. Without this day, our country would still be in darkness. Anyone who uses violence against our motherland must rise up and resist. It is absolutely impossible to seek help from other countries. In short, respond to violence with violence. Our country maintains peace and is determined to resist aggression. If it is said that country A has the right to demand and take, and country B only has the obligation to give everything away, no force can force us to obey this kind of statement. Our country has no intention of encroaching on any country. If other countries want to harm our rights and interests and infringe upon our country's dignity, whether direct or indirect, they must be resisted. "Our attitude can be understood by all friendly countries, and they have clearly expressed their own attitudes, which I am happy to state. ] At this point, General Śmigły-Rydz clenched his fist and struck the table, saying, "The Free City of Danzig has been linked to our country for centuries and is the lifeline of our economic structure. I hereby clearly state that our country will never unilaterally abandon its international obligations. What our country does in the Free City of Danzig is to respond to the other party's actions and has no other purpose." After General Śmigły-Rydz finished his speech, the audience applauded enthusiastically and raised their hands to take an oath, roughly saying, "We solemnly swear that we are willing to fight for the permanent power of Poland in wartime until victory is achieved. In peacetime, we are willing to unite the strength of all citizens and cooperate sincerely." After hearing about General Śmigły-Rydz's speech, political figures here were very satisfied and said that Poland's attitude has now been clearly explained. The importance of this public's resolute expression in the capacity of the leader of the army is self-evident. (Havas dispatch on the 6th)

### Göring Inspects the Junkers Factory, Convenes Workers for a Speech, Exaggerating Air Force Strength

(Berlin) Air Minister General Göring went to Dessau City today to inspect the Junkers aircraft manufacturing plant and immediately convened all the workers to deliver a speech, in which he said: "We are now actively expanding our military power so that when other countries force us to go to war, we can calmly respond and achieve victory. Looking back to last September, the reason why we were able to restore the freedom of the Germans in the Sudetenland was simply because we possessed a new and powerful air force that other countries did not have. Now, the same remarks as last year have been issued from across the English Channel, threatening the German nation. It has become customary for Britain to interfere in the interests of other countries without any reason, which is actually the reason for the war. For us, although we do not want to threaten Britain, if that country hinders our progress everywhere, the consequences will endanger world peace, and the responsibility should be borne by Britain. At present, our air force is strong and the amount of wheat stored is abundant, and we are no longer afraid of foreign blockades, but we do not want war either, because I know the meaning of war deeply. The responsibility that any politician can bear is the most important responsibility for war, but if we are forced to fight, we will surely win. In short, we will never allow anyone to deny the interests of our country's survival, neither by force nor by sweet words." (Havas dispatch on the 5th)

### A German Submarine Fleet Arrives in Sweden

### British and French Representatives Go to the Soviet Union to Participate in the Three-Nation Military Talks: Important Points of Contention Have Been Resolved: Strang Flew Back to London Yesterday

(London) The British and French military delegations set off from here this afternoon to Moscow to hold staff talks with the Soviet military authorities. This group is composed of senior staff officers of the British and French naval, land, and air forces. The special ship Exeter City will sail abroad, with the Soviet red flag hoisted. It will not follow the usual route through the Kiel Canal, but will bypass the Baltic Sea, which is about two days longer than the usual commercial route. After landing in Leningrad, they will take the train directly to Moscow to begin talks with the Soviet representatives, led by General Voroshilov. This talk is a preliminary contact before the establishment of the British, French, and Soviet tripartite agreement. The Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, personally went to the station to see them off today, shaking hands with the British and French representatives one by one and talking happily. The British chief representative, Admiral Plunkett, told roadside interviewers that he had no right to speak, but perhaps he could report something when he returned home. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)

(Moscow) It is reported that Strang, the British Foreign Office's special envoy to attend the British, French, and Soviet conference in order to establish a tripartite agreement, will fly back to London today. After that, British Ambassador Seeds, French Ambassador Naggiar, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will continue negotiations. According to reliable sources, important differences in opinion have now been resolved, but the definition of the term "indirect aggression" is still a matter for further discussion. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin met with the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union today to discuss the procedures for receiving the British and French military delegations. It is expected that the British, French, and Soviet negotiations may not have any development until Strang personally reports the situation to London. Approximately, the military talks will temporarily become more prominent than the political talks. Without considerable progress in the military talks, the British, French, and Soviet convention is unlikely to have a substantial decision. (Reuters dispatch on the 6th)

(London) Staff members of the British, French, and Soviet general staff departments will hold talks in Moscow. The British and French military delegations boarded a ship at Tilbury Port this afternoon and went to the Soviet Union. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)

### Why Isn't My Wife as Passionate as Before?

Please examine yourself for any morbid conditions before complaining about your wife!

Why is it that "other people's wives are always better"? If his wife is also thinking, "other people's husbands are always better"! What should we do? Let us use a fair perspective to criticize: If a wife has children, because she is a housewife and also holds the position of mother, she will inevitably be a little more trivial. At this time, as a husband, he should be considerate. In addition, there are also husbands who like the new and are tired of the old. Because they are always with their wives every day, even if their wives are still as beautiful and passionate as before, they will also feel bored. So they begin to seek pleasure outside. How can a domestic flower be as fragrant as a wild flower? However, this kind of man will eventually reap the bitter fruit. Before long, the new acquaintance also feels bored, and true and eternal love abandons him because indulgence hurts his body, causing him to sink into the sea of ​​suffering from illness! A devoted woman for a heartless man. Women's love is always more focused than men's. Unless a woman does not marry him, once she marries him, she will be wholeheartedly devoted to him. To use physiological lust as an example: the virgin period is often very light, but after marriage, after the husband's teasing, it gradually continues to grow higher and higher. This is a natural physiological phenomenon. Therefore, for a husband who is energetic and satisfied by his wife, love after marriage will definitely progress with the times, reaching a state of joy and harmony, and happiness without end! But if a man has committed self-pollution and seminal emission in his early years, or early marriage with multiple wives, and indulges in lust, consuming too much of his reproductive gland fluid, then he will inevitably have depleted essence and blood, and a hundred diseases will arise. The most difficult to avoid are kidney weakness, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, neurasthenia, and scattered energy. Therefore, even if the wife is passionate, how can the husband bear to enjoy it? His body and mind are affected, resulting in the wife's lack of feeling and infertility, etc., which are too numerous to mention. Is this the wife's fault, or the husband's fault, for the wife's sexual indifference? According to Dr. Wamallesing, a famous German doctor, in several cases published in the German Medical Journal, he said: "The husband's premature ejaculation is cured, and the wife's hysteria is also suddenly cured." Because marital life is so beneficial to the body and mind, otherwise both parties will suffer unspeakably! Regarding the treatment methods for the above symptoms, according to Dr. Wang and my years of experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproduction Hormone" is the most effective. Because this agent is a special agent for supplementing the reproductive glands. The quality is precious, the efficacy is certain, and there is probably no match in the world. It can produce sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate the blood, and nourish the nerves the next day and night after taking it. Continuing to take it for half a month can also help growth and adjust metabolism. The above symptoms can be completely cured. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Himitotto's Semen-Stabilizing Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop the leakage, then the root cause and symptoms can be treated at the same time, and the effect is even faster.

### Seminal Emission and Neurasthenia
— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Doctor Zhan Nianceng

Young people's semen is well hidden in the seminal vesicles with tightly closed sperm gates. Why is there seminal emission? According to the opinions of most doctors: it is believed that seminal emission must be caused by neurasthenia, which weakens the function of the sexual nerves that control the sperm gates, resulting in a relaxation phenomenon. Therefore, even when slightly stimulated by a dream or seeing a woman and causing the penis to erect, semen will involuntarily leak out. We only need to see that someone who has committed self-pollution and indulgence will inevitably develop seminal emission. This kind of activity is most likely to cause neurasthenia.

In physiological terms, semen is the reproductive gland fluid and is the source of our life. A man who never commits self-pollution and indulgence and cherishes his reproductive gland fluid will definitely be physically strong, think cleverly, and have abundant energy. This kind of young man will have unlimited prospects in academics and career and is a treasure of society and a promising talent for the nation and the country. At the same time, he is also sought after by women of the times. Once he marries a healthy and beautiful woman, he will surely have lively love, a sweet life, and raise sons and daughters, and there will be no end to happiness. However, a young man who does not know how to love himself, having committed self-pollution, indulgence, or early marriage and licentiousness, weakens his sexual nerves, resulting in seminal emission; and then allows the seminal emission to continue to be untreated, causing the symptoms to worsen, increasing the number of seminal emissions, or even developing the terrible spermatorrhea and sperm leakage, then because too much reproductive gland fluid is lost, the sexual, brain, and spinal cord nerves, which have mutual connections, will become weaker and weaker. Therefore, symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, and scattered energy will entangle endlessly, which will trap you in a city of sorrow and a sea of ​​suffering. Not only will there be no hope for the future, but also the happiness of married life will be completely lost!

Regarding seminal emission methods, Chinese and foreign doctors admire "Himitotto's Semen-Stabilizing Tablets" as the most effective holy medicine for treating the symptoms. Because this medicine can strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves after taking it, it can often achieve the magical effect of sleeping peacefully and stopping seminal emission that night. If the above symptoms are caused by seminal emission for too long or early marriage and indulgence, then the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproduction Hormone" must also be taken to nourish the brain and kidneys and nourish the nerves. Continuing to take it for half a month can also help growth and adjust new metabolism. The above symptoms can be completely cured. Regular consumption in all seasons can also prolong life and rejuvenate!

### Breast Atrophy and Frigidity - The Devils that Destroy Love!
— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Losing a clear curve and a posture without sensuality. Therefore, they are never liked by men of the times, and their common destiny is already very tragic, and the love of couples is already very weak. However, because of the atrophy of her breasts, the reproductive gland and ovarian function is unhealthy, and she will inevitably suffer from frigidity. Think about it: this kind of woman, usually the husband is not very satisfied with her, if she is indifferent to it when the man's sexual desire is high, without any enthusiastic expression, or even tired of it and refuses it, then the image she gives to the man is of course even worse. Because it is even worse, love decreases day by day, and bad feelings deepen, and eventually she is regarded as waste, and even disdained, or another golden house is built to hide a beauty. Isn't this a very common thing? According to medical judgment. A woman, to avoid this kind of misfortune, the first important thing is to develop her breasts. If a woman's breasts can be high and elastic, then her ovarian function is healthy, her metabolism is strong, and her hips must also be plump and her curves are fully exposed. In terms of beauty, she already has a sensual and moving posture. Moreover, these women have strong sex appeal, and the love between couples is deep and intense, and their happiness is naturally infinite. However, women with atrophied breasts don't have to be discouraged. With the progress of modern medicine, there is already an ovarian endocrine preparation for women [Reproduction Hormone] that can be saved. This agent has been proven by famous doctors from all over the world and is considered to have a peaceful medicinal property and great efficacy. If you continue to take it, not only can the atrophied breasts become higher day by day, but also can adjust menstruation, eliminate uterine diseases, promote pregnancy function, increase love between the sexes, strengthen the body and beautify the face. It is difficult to describe all the functions.

### Recovery from Gonorrheal Cystitis

Gonorrheal cystitis is inflammation caused by gonorrhea invading the bladder from the posterior urethra. Patients are mostly caused by missed treatment, mistreatment, and self-ignorance. Nowadays, most city doctors have backward knowledge and still believe that gonorrhea is a local disease in the urethra. They desperately use local surgery to wash the urethra. On the one hand, because during acute gonorrhea, the urethral mucosa is inflamed and swollen, there may even be ulcers. At this time, they are still unaware of the harm and recklessly use the method of washing the urethra to seek the expulsion of gonococci, which is tantamount to adding fuel to the fire, because it allows gonococci to take the opportunity to attack internally and escape to the bladder. Cystitis that could have been avoided is now caused by the misuse of this treatment method. In addition, this disease can also be caused by the abuse of over-the-counter drugs, prolonged neglect, or drinking and sexual activity. Patients have frequent urination, abdominal distension, and turbid urine. If examined with a bladder reflector, inflammatory swelling can be seen on the bladder head or bladder wall. If the leucoorrhea is examined under a microscope, other bacteria, such as pyogenic cocci, can still be seen.

The most direct bactericidal method in the treatment is the bladder lavage method, but it must be performed by skilled surgeons to avoid harm. On the one hand, the German Filtrin intravenous electrotherapy is used, and the latest chemical method of special medicine is taken internally. Considering all aspects, there is no need to worry about the poor prognosis of cystitis, but during the treatment period, it is necessary to avoid reckless actions to avoid losing all previous efforts. It must be remembered. Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, closed on Sunday afternoons.

### U.S. Congress Adjourns: Most of the President's Proposals Pass, Neutrality Act Amendment is Shelved

(Washington) The 76th Congress adjourned at 11:36 PM today (Greenwich time), and is scheduled to reconvene in January next year. (Havas dispatch on the 6th)

(Washington) This session of Congress adjourned last night. The intensity of the debate beforehand was unprecedented since President Roosevelt took office. The House of Representatives adjourned at 6:30 PM, and the Senate followed suit five minutes later. Regarding President Roosevelt's balanced budget bill, the Senate has stipulated that its funding is US$190 million, while the amount allocated by the House of Representatives is US$54 million. This session of Congress has lasted for seven months, and its most significant fact is to oppose President Roosevelt and greatly expand the amount of expenditure, the most important uses of which are 2 billion yuan for national defense, 1.77 billion yuan for relief, and 1.194 billion yuan for agricultural programs. Another major trend of this session of Congress is the formation of a strong group of Republicans and conservative Democrats, which rejected the President's loan bill and refused to amend the Neutrality Act. As for President Roosevelt's victory, it lies in the smooth passage of the stabilization fund and the extension of the right to devalue the currency. (Associated Press dispatch on the 6th)

(Washington) The Senate and House of Representatives adjourned late today. Although many of the proposals submitted by President Roosevelt have been rejected, many have been passed. Among them, most of the expenses in the budget proposal submitted by the President have been approved, such as US$1,734,000,000 for national defense and US$1,756,000,000 for unemployment relief. Other bills, such as the extension of the validity of the Currency and Finance Full Power Act and the administrative agency reform bill, have also been passed. On the other hand, the bill proposed by Democratic Senator Hatch that federal government employees should not participate in political activities was passed after a long period of discussion, regardless of the President's intentions. The Senate decided to postpone the discussion of the Neutrality Act amendment. All of this deserves general attention. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)

### Germany Opens a New Seaport in the Baltic Sea

(Berlin) Germany is building a new seaport in Stolpmünde in the Baltic Sea. After the port is completed, the journey from Berlin to Pillau Port in East Prussia can be shortened by eight hours. The trade and transportation that previously passed through the Swinemünde military port can be mostly rerouted to the new port. In the event of war, the losses of commerce can be reduced and the distraction of military operations can be avoided. Swinemünde Port is the third most important naval base in Germany. Germany's territory is obstructed by the Polish Corridor, and East Prussia is not connected to other parts of Germany. If you take the waterway from Swinemünde Port to Pillau Port, the distance is 390 kilometers. Previously, the journey from Berlin to Pillau Port took 21 hours. In the future, after the completion of Stolpmünde Port and the railway connecting the port to Berlin, the journey will be shortened and can be reached in only 13 hours. (Haitong dispatch on the 6th)

### Assassination Occurs During Mexican Election

Mexico City: The election campaign in the capital of Mexico, which had just begun a few days ago, suddenly saw a political assassination this afternoon.  Representative Sira, leader of the opposition Constitutional Civil Front Party (a party inclined toward fascism and with anti-Semitic tendencies) and also a colonel, was leaving the party headquarters when a group of thugs lying in wait shot at him with pistols. He was hit in the stomach and his survival is unlikely. After the incident, Colonel Sira's guards also returned fire, killing two of the thugs. According to police investigations, the mastermind behind this case is General Cárdenas (not to be confused with the Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas). He has already been arrested. This man supports General Dávila, the garrison commander of the capital, as a candidate for president, while Colonel Sira supports General Almazán as a candidate.  Although both factions are against the current government, they are as incompatible as fire and water. This is said to be the reason for the assassination. (Havas News Agency, 5th)

### Disastrous Torrential Rains in North China; Japanese Troops Assault American, Reap What They Sow

A dispatch from Peiping in the "North-China Daily News" of July 28 states:  Continuous heavy rains have inundated North China. Tungchow, east of Peiping, has been flooded for several days, and people can only travel by boat on the roads. The countryside west of Peiping is also submerged. Foreigners residing outside the racecourse area are trapped in small houses, and some have waded into the city. In some places, the water is waist-deep.  Most railway lines are impassable due to flooding. No trains have run south of Paoting on the Peiping-Hankow Railway for over two weeks, and recently even Paoting has been cut off.  The Peiping-Suiyuan Railway is interrupted in several places. The new railway through Kupeikou to Jehol is completely out of service. Temporary bridges built between here and Kupeikou have all been washed away.  The railway built by the Japanese, passing through the old Yellow River bed to connect the Peiping-Hankow Railway and Kaifeng, has been completely swept away by the water. Chinese people with thousands of years of experience with the Yellow River would never have made the mistake of building a railway across the old Yellow River channel. During the flooding, guerrilla forces have become active again, approaching quite close to the city. A night attack by guerrillas occurred outside Hsuanwu Gate, and thirty Chinese, including many police officers, along with their guns and uniforms, were taken away. The Tungchihmen police station was also attacked, and the guerrillas surrounded the station, seizing a large number of guns and ammunition, and also capturing police uniforms. They then infiltrated and ambushed Japanese sentry posts. When real police came to reinforce, they were also mistaken for guerrillas by the Japanese troops, who opened fire on them.  They were forced to abandon their weapons and only avoided being killed after lengthy explanations. A Japanese sentry post at a hot spring in the Western Hills was suddenly attacked by guerrillas from Mao Feng Mountain (transliteration), suffering heavy losses. The next morning, Japanese reinforcements arrived, and the attackers retreated.  The currency continues to fall, causing the general standard of living to rise. Japanese residents are also affected, just like everyone else. Today, Japanese shops, taverns, and entertainment venues have very few Japanese customers. Although the Japanese have placed huge announcements in the Chinese newspapers they control and posted English and Chinese slogans such as "Down with England" on telegraph poles and trees in a widespread propaganda effort, the anti-British movement in Peiping has not shown any signs of flourishing. According to Chinese sources, the heads of various guilds recently held a secret meeting and issued a private warning to Lian Jiaqi (transliteration), the main instigator of the anti-British movement, stating that if he did not stop this movement, he would suffer personal harm.  Due to currency chaos and import restrictions, trade is already very depressed and cannot bear the burden of false political disturbances. The news of the United States' abrogation of its commercial treaty with Japan came at a time when Japanese residents here were being incited and were very resentful of the British. This suddenly disheartened them and made them quite apprehensive. According to precedent, the Japanese should launch an anti-American movement in response to this move by the United States, but the sword of embargo hangs over their heads, and even Japanese soldiers can only endure it. It can now be safely predicted that from now on, they will treat American residents with much more caution and humility. British residents criticize the British government for not considering similar steps some time ago, which is truly regrettable. Only a few days before the American ultimatum, there was an incident where Japanese soldiers violently assaulted two American citizens from a local Christian university.  The incident occurred when the two Americans stopped their car in front of a Japanese sentry post at a hot spring.  Because there was no sentry outside the post, one of the Americans entered the barracks with a Japanese military pass to have it verified.  Unexpectedly, the Japanese soldiers loaded their rifles with live ammunition, as if they were about to open fire. Another Japanese soldier slapped the American in the face several times, presumably because he had entered their barracks without permission.  A Chinese policeman who led the American inside was also beaten and abused.  Another American entered the barracks to help his friend and was also beaten and humiliated.  Even the Chinese driver sitting in the car was beaten. When the incident was reported to the Japanese embassy, the embassy routinely apologized. However, the Japanese military did not take the assault seriously.  A Japanese military spokesman also defended himself with the same old clichés, saying that it must have been "due to a misunderstanding" and that "an investigation would be conducted, and anyone found guilty would be punished." However, this event is truly unfortunate for the Japanese. According to American sources here, this assault case is the most serious of similar incidents. American newspapers have published it with large headlines, which ultimately led Washington to make a surprising and sudden move. It is said that when the U.S. government handed the note to the Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Horinouchi, it clearly stated that there could be no more assaults on American citizens. According to those returning to Peiping from Peitaiho, trains from the three eastern provinces are full of wealthy Chinese seeking refuge. The three eastern provinces seem to be quite alarmed these days, fearing possible air raids by Soviet aircraft. Therefore, wealthy Chinese are seeking refuge in areas that they hope will be more beneficial to their health. It is said that Puyi has recently moved to Dalian.

### The Situation on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Becomes Tense: Chinese Troops Advance on Jiaxing; Japanese Forces Caught Off Guard Suffer Heavy Losses; Fighting Also Occurs in the Shanghai Suburbs of Zhenru and Longhua

In recent days, the regular, elite Chinese troops along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway have been very active. Since crossing the railway, they have advanced towards the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway line. A few days ago, they launched a trial attack on Jiaxing, catching the Japanese forces off guard and inflicting heavy losses. Yesterday, a person from Jiashan told our reporter that yesterday afternoon (the 5th), around 12:00 PM, the Japanese forces, seeking revenge, dispatched a heavy bomber, which flew to Xitang Town, Jiashan, and dropped two bombs on Xitang Hospital. One bomb landed on Wanfu Restaurant, killing and wounding forty to fifty civilians. Three bombs landed behind the church, one on Lion Bridge, one at the western end of the North Pond Bridge, and one on the Lu family stone workshop in Tawan, reportedly causing many deaths and injuries.

Chinese Troops Attack Jiaxing, Inflicting Heavy Losses on the Japanese

Recently, Japanese forces along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway have heightened their alert, suddenly becoming tense. It is reported that Chinese troops are now launching attacks on the Japanese forces between Hangzhou and Jiaxing with a large number of troops divided into several groups. It is rumored that Chinese troops launched a trial attack on Jiaxing a few days ago, catching the Japanese forces off guard and inflicting heavy losses. At the same time, Chinese troops have also been repeatedly sighted in the suburbs and within the city of Hangzhou, causing great panic among the Japanese forces.

Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Line: Japanese Build Trenches

Recently, a gentleman came to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Jiaxing Road and claimed that the Japanese forces are rushing to build trenches along the railway line. All major transportation routes have barbed wire set up. The Japanese forces' state of panic is evident in their expressions. They are extremely strict in checking passengers. Anyone even slightly suspected must undergo several hours of interrogation and search before being allowed to pass.

Villagers Eagerly Await the Arrival of Chinese Troops

In recent days, it has been widely rumored in the occupied areas that Chinese troops will recover major cities in the Eastern Theater before September 18th. The number of Japanese troops in the Jiaxing-Hangzhou area has indeed decreased compared to before. According to local farmers, it is currently the busy season for harvesting, and the new grain is about to be brought in. Farmers are often forcibly conscripted by the Japanese forces to serve as porters. At this time when agricultural work is becoming more urgent by the day, farmers eagerly await the arrival of Chinese troops to relieve their suffering.

Yang Guocai Sacrifices His Life for the Nation

Yang Guocai (also known as Yang Mao), under the command of Gu Fusheng of the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps stationed north of Qinghu Highway near Dujia Lane in western Shanghai, recently advanced eastward and moved to the Shenxiang and Shenjiatang areas, two kilometers northwest of Qibao Town. On the first day of this month, they held a military conference in Qibao Town at noon to discuss strategies for ambushing the Japanese forces stationed on Hongqiao Road. Unexpectedly, a Japanese spy discovered this and reported it to the Japanese army headquarters. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese forces secretly mobilized the garrison troops stationed at Hongqiao Airport that evening, carrying weapons such as machine guns and small cannons, and secretly rushed to Shenxiang overnight, surrounding Yang Guocai's troops from all directions. At dawn on the second day, they launched a fierce attack. Yang's troops were caught off guard while still asleep and scattered in all directions. When Yang Guocai heard the noise and rushed out, he was already surrounded. He had no choice but to fight back while retreating. Unfortunately, during the fierce battle, he was suddenly ambushed by Japanese forces hiding in a corner, who threw three hand grenades, destroying Yang's left hand and severely wounding his leg. He was covered in blood and sacrificed his life for the nation. In addition to Yang's heroic sacrifice, over thirty of his subordinates were killed or wounded. Furthermore, over twenty innocent villagers were killed by Japanese machine gun fire. Their bodies were abandoned along the road. When this reporter passed through Qibao on the third day, he saw a large number of villagers, filled with resentment and anger, purchasing coffins in the town to collect the bodies of those who had died unjustly.

Fierce Fighting in Zhenru and Longhua Yesterday

News from western Shanghai states that yesterday morning (the 6th) at dawn, dense gunfire was heard from Longhua Town in the Shanghai suburbs. Around 6:00 AM, the sound of planes roaring was heard in the sky, followed by two sudden explosions. According to general speculation, this was undoubtedly a fierce battle between Japanese and Chinese troops in the area. Furthermore, at 8:00 AM, a Japanese seaplane circled over Longhua for a long time, then flew over the concession and towards Zhabei along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. It is reported that regular Chinese troops are currently very active between the Zhenru and Longhua railways.

### Rice Industry Attempts to Raise Prices; Authorities in Both Concessions Firmly Maintain Price Controls; Determined to Suppress Manipulation and Maintain Security Within the Concessions

The period between harvests, when the supply and demand of rice are unbalanced, is an annual occurrence. Although the amount of rice stored in Shanghai's warehouses is not large, the authorities' investigation and announcement include the stock in rice shops, as well as the amount secretly stored elsewhere by rice merchants. Furthermore, the amount of flour in storage is sufficient for sixteen months, so there is absolutely no need to worry about the people's food supply. However, rice merchants see the current situation as an excellent opportunity for speculation and monopoly, and they refuse to let go, preferring to stop trading rather than compromise on the price controls. It is rumored that there are currently 100,000 piculs of rice stored in Pudong and along the Pu River. Although transporting it to Shanghai involves complicated procedures, there is still a small profit to be made. However, rice merchants are unwilling to purchase it. Flour merchants are also taking advantage of this opportunity to raise the price of flour along with the price of rice. If this continues, the authorities will inevitably have to take control of the sales.

Refusing to Deal Under the Table: Rice Market Stalls

In the past week, the chaotic situation in the rice market has reached a boiling point. A small number of rice merchants are only interested in profiting, ignoring the authorities' price controls and the guild's advice, leading to rampant trading under the table. The Rice Dealers' Guild believes that the rice shops are in a difficult situation, so they have stopped buying goods subject to price controls since the 5th. Hundreds of rice shops have jointly signed to comply, and the rice market has stalled.

Rice Shops' Attitude Turns Passive

The Rice Dealers' Guild's announcement advising members to comply with price controls has been published in the newspaper twice due to the rampant trading under the table. Their painstaking efforts to care for the people's food supply have long been appreciated by the citizens. However, in recent days, rice shops, except for old customers who can obtain high-quality rice for around twenty-two yuan, offer second-grade rice to new customers for twenty yuan. If one wants to buy good rice, they reply that the stock is sold out and there is no way to buy it. Their unified response makes it difficult to argue. Their passive attitude is evident.

Manipulating the Rice Market: Attempting to Lift Price Controls

Reporters from the Xin Xin News Agency have investigated various tactics used in the rice market, such as (1) storing rice in various locations to avoid investigation, (2) rice dealers refusing to show samples to deliberately disturb people's minds, and (3) rice shops using the excuse that there is no rice to import and deciding to sell out their remaining stock and then stop selling. Under this coordinated manipulation of transportation and sales, how can rice prices not rise, and how can trading under the table be eradicated? The facts prove that the goal is to attempt to lift the price controls. This kind of phenomenon occurring during this extraordinary period is truly regrettable.

Concession Authorities Remain Calm

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council of the French Concession originally set price controls on rice to maintain the food supply for millions of people in Shanghai and to protect social stability. Furthermore, when setting the price controls, they invited representatives from various rice industry groups to discuss and decide. The set price controls take into account both maintaining the people's food supply and the interests of the rice merchants. Therefore, they will continue to implement the price controls as usual. If there is any trading above the price controls, citizens can immediately report it.

Rice Dealers Discuss the Root of the Rice Market Problem

Recently, rice prices have risen, and there have been instances of trading under the table in the market that exceeds the price controls. The Rice Dealers' Guild believes that rice shops are generally in a difficult situation and have exhausted their responsibility to advise. However, whether or not there is coordinated manipulation of transportation and sales concerns the food supply of all citizens. It is hoped that people in the industry will rely on their conscience to create benefits for the public. Yesterday, a senior official of the Rice Dealers' Guild stated, "The rise and fall of rice market prices are determined by rice merchants at any time. Rice shops must listen to the broker's offer when buying rice on the market. Therefore, the brokers control the prices. If brokers can comply with price controls when showing samples and offering prices, rice shops will definitely not buy at high prices, causing difficulties in sales. Currently, shops are complying with price controls, and this guild has also repeatedly announced to all rice shops to strictly comply. From this, it can be seen that rice shops can indeed comply with price controls. This is proven by the facts. As for the higher prices under the table in the market, the root cause lies entirely with the selling brokers. Because member rice shops comply with price controls, there is nowhere to buy goods in the market. If they buy under the table and sell according to price controls, they will not only sacrifice their capital but also violate the law. Therefore, they have jointly and voluntarily signed to comply with price controls and not buy rice under the table as a passive response, while also reducing their own suffering. It is also rumored that a certain large rice factory on Mei Bai Ge Road has warehouses. The guild has also sent personnel to investigate and found that there was a misunderstanding. The market has rice milling on behalf of customers, and there are no goods in stock that exceed the price controls. In short, rice shops focus on retail. Since there is a standard for price controls, how can they sell goods purchased at high prices? This guild is currently conducting a close investigation. If there are any violations, they will be reported," and so on.

### Government's Determination to Stabilize the Currency System Remains Unchanged; Unscrupulous Merchants Seek Profit by Deliberately Spreading Rumors; Proving Them False Will Restore Public Confidence

Regarding the rumor that the Chinese government has commissioned British companies to print 10 billion new banknotes, Shanghai banks have not heard of it, so it cannot be verified. However, the Chinese government is determined to maintain the value of the legal tender and will not change it. The rumor that there will be inflation is absolutely false. If the value of the legal tender is not maintained, the people's faith in the government will be lost, and the losses will far outweigh the gains. It should be known that if the credibility of the legal tender cannot be maintained, how can the people believe that the war of resistance will be won and the nation will be built? The current strength of the war of resistance relies on the credibility of the legal tender. Today, the government consistently maintains the statutory foreign exchange rate and continues to provide as much as possible for legitimate needs. The Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China issue legal tender, which is inspected monthly by the Issuance Reserve Committee and announced monthly to demonstrate their integrity. The latest inspection report shows that although the issuance has increased, the cash reserve is still above 44%, which is higher than most countries' cash reserves. The above facts prove that China has not experienced inflation. Therefore, it is predicted that the financial market will stabilize starting today (Monday), proving the rumors to be false. However, the unscrupulous merchants' deliberate spreading of rumors is aimed at profiting, which is very disappointing.

### British Merchant Ship Haig Sails the Nanyang Route; Scheduled to Weigh Anchor Tomorrow Morning; Primarily for Loading Cargo

To maintain their shipping industry in China, foreign shipping companies, in addition to increasing ships sailing the Shanghai-Hong Kong route and the Hong Kong defense line, have also opened new Nanyang routes. Today, the British merchant ship Haig is scheduled to depart from Shanghai tomorrow morning for Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang, Yangon, etc., primarily for loading cargo. As for the Zhoushan Islands (i.e., Dinghai) in eastern Zhejiang, since their fall, some have contacted the Japanese to obtain travel permits and chartered ships to sail the Shanghai-Dinghai route, as well as Shenjiamen and Daishan. In addition, there is also the Xiamen route, which is under Japanese control and also barely operates.

### New Philippine Steamer to Sail to Shanghai; Named After Mrs. Quezon's Maiden Name

One of the three sister ships produced by the American Manila Teheran-Maru Shipping Company, the "Dona Aurora Quezon" light steamer, will leave the Italian shipyard there next month and arrive on the Chinese seas. The ship's name is the maiden name of the current Philippine President Quezon's wife. It has a deadweight of 9,500 tons. Future plans include scheduled voyages between New York, Manila, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. The maiden voyage is scheduled to go to New York via Karachi. The steamer has twelve passenger cabins and a cruising speed of fifteen nautical miles per hour.

Departing from Manila to Sail to America

The entire journey can be completed in forty days, and a short stay is planned in Los Angeles. The Teheran-Maru Shipping Company has a historical shipbuilding company. The other two sister steamers will leave the Italian shipyard after the "Dona Aurora Quezon" in the coming year, either in February or March or no later than May. It is generally hoped that when the steamer returns to Manila from New York, President Quezon will be asked to perform the naming ceremony.

### Unified Class A Public Bonds: Regular Lottery; Principal Repayment of 3.75 Million

After the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China discounted and paid for the matured principal and interest of the customs-guaranteed debts, the seventh principal repayment and interest payment of the Unified Public Bonds began on July 31. As for the eighth principal repayment lottery, the National Debt Fund Management Committee has scheduled it separately. The Unified Class A Public Bonds are scheduled to hold the lottery at 10:00 AM on August 10, drawing twenty-five winners, with a principal repayment of 3.75 million yuan. The payment date is January 31 of next year.

### Polish Envoy Weidenthal's Health Improves

Polish Envoy Weidenthal suddenly fell ill a few days ago. After being treated at the Hong'en Hospital, he has not yet fully recovered. It is reported that Weidenthal suffered from acute appendicitis. His condition is currently very good and he is expected to be discharged from the hospital in a few days.

### Attaché of the French Embassy, Briot, Arrives in Shanghai

The French-language Shanghai Daily reported on the 6th that Attaché Briot of the French Embassy in China, accompanied by his wife, has returned from a trip to Indochina and has now arrived in Shanghai.

### Non-Essential Goods Banned from Import: Trade Deficit Expected to Decrease Gradually; Goods Already Imported and Taxed Allowed to Be Re-Exported; Import Ports Limited to Central Government Control

After the Ministry of Finance announced the measures to ban the import of goods, it has issued orders to customs offices in various locations for implementation, aimed at reducing the trade deficit and stabilizing finance. Goods that have already been imported and taxed, with the import ports under the central government's control at the time of tax payment, are allowed to be re-exported. The details of the import of essential goods and the supply of statutory foreign exchange are described below:

Order Issued for Implementation: Imports Banned

The Ministry of Finance issued orders to customs offices in various locations, stating that to reduce the trade deficit and stabilize finance, it has specially formulated measures to ban the import of goods during extraordinary times and has published a table listing the tariff codes and goods. The implementation will begin immediately. These banned import goods are not allowed to be declared for re-export after the ban is issued. All imported or re-exported postal packages are also subject to the provisions of these measures. However, in special circumstances, the ministry may issue special purchase and transport licenses, allowing a certain amount to be imported. Regarding the re-export of these banned import goods, if a reliable certificate can be provided proving that the import tax payable was paid at the import port before the ban was implemented, and the import port was under central government control at the time of tax payment, re-export may also be allowed. You are hereby ordered to comply and implement accordingly. (The table is printed in the newspaper and is omitted here.)

Essential Goods: Supply of Foreign Exchange

All goods that are not banned from import and are necessary for the country are still allowed to be imported or re-exported, and they may apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase statutory foreign exchange according to the rules for applying for the purchase of foreign exchange for imported goods, designating the Central Bank of China and the Communications Bank of China to handle it. However, they must pay the balance fee for the difference between the statutory foreign exchange rate and the listed price of the Central Bank of China and the Communications Bank of China. Regarding the export of local goods, the foreign exchange received should be sold to the Central Bank of China and the Communications Bank of China, and they are allowed to receive the difference between the statutory foreign exchange rate and the listed price of the Central Bank of China and the Communications Bank of China. Therefore, the export of local goods will inevitably gradually increase, and the import of foreign goods, except for essential goods, will be strictly restricted. China's overall trade deficit is expected to decrease, and international trade will improve, allowing income and expenditure to be balanced.

### Australia Considers British Intentions: May Abolish Trade with Japan; Sino-Australian Trade Has Greatly Improved; Far East War Generally Sympathetic to China

The Continental News reports that the development of Far East trade in recent years has made the Australian Commonwealth extremely concerned about Pacific affairs and is in a position to agree that the British government may require the Commonwealth to abolish any subordinate trade with Japan, which is far superior to what it was before. Japan's purchases of goods from Australia (mainly wool) have fallen from nearly £18 million to around £6 million. Due to the surge in trade last year, Australia's imports from China (mostly wheat flour and wool) will be almost equal to Japan's annual purchases.

Australia's Exports to China Suddenly Increase

The reporter yesterday (5th) asked Mr. Bowden, the Australian government's commercial commissioner in China, about the Australian government's reaction to a possible British-Japanese trade break. He replied that Australia's exports to China have suddenly increased within a year, placing China and Japan on an equal footing in terms of purchasing Australian goods. According to the figures provided by Mr. Bowden, Japan has retreated to the status of the largest non-Australian customer, while Australia's trade with China has almost risen to pre-war levels. In terms of customs gold units, Australia's exports to China from January to June last year were 3,702,734, and the figure for the same period this year has reached 16,397,591.

Australian-Japanese Trade Suffers a Blow

In the year ending July 1936, Japan purchased goods worth £17,661,232 from Australia and exported £4,969,571 to Australia. In mid-1936, the Australian Federation implemented a licensing system aimed at promoting Australian production and assisting British products such as cotton, causing Australian-Japanese trade to suffer a blow. Japan immediately retaliated in the Australian wool market. In 1936, Japan ranked second in purchasing the most Australian wool, purchasing £14 million worth. By July 1937, Japan's imports from Australia had fallen from £17,661,232 to £9,705,738, and last year it fell again to £5,900,098, which is not much different from Australia's purchases from Japan of £5,349,086. Mr. Bowden talked about the increase in Sino-Australian trade, saying that it has greatly prospered. In one year of trade, wool imports have increased from 82,710 customs gold units to 605,800.

Australia's Position is the Same as Britain's

Yesterday, another important Australian told reporters that there is no doubt about what Australia will do if Chamberlain takes real action in the Far East. At that time, even if we sacrifice our wool trade with Japan, we will hear Australia's sincere opinions. Australia's response to the motherland's call last September has shown which side it sympathizes with in the Axis powers.

Japanese Loading of Scrap Iron Repeatedly Prevented

It should be remembered here that the Labor opposition party in the Australian government completely opposes Japan and its current international policies. If the Labor opposition party has a say in Australian policy, Australian-Japanese trade relations will be immediately severed. If the federal government had not used strong legal weapons to intervene, Japanese ships would often have been prevented from loading scrap iron. The frequency with which this happened is enough to give a full glimpse into what workers think of the Sino-Japanese war.

Japanese Experiment in Sheep Herding Clearly Fails

According to another Australian, no matter what happens in the future, Japan will only stop buying Australian wool if it lacks foreign exchange. The Japanese have tried to raise spiral-horned sheep in Manchuria, but failed because the climate there is humid and they have to put rubber covers on the sheep's feet to prevent them from getting sick. Some say that the Japanese will raise sheep all over Manchuria to compete with Australian wool in the market. In his personal opinion, if the Japanese transport more sheep there now, they will provide more delicious lamb meals to the guerrillas.

China Buys 500,000 Military Blankets

One day, it will be Australia's largest customer for wool and sheep. Every winter, the number of people using wool for official purposes is increasing. This year, the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives have ordered 500,000 military wool blankets. China's wool cannot meet domestic demand and must raise sheep soon, first operated by a government department and then extended to farmers in the mountainous areas of the southwest. Agricultural experts who have been working in western China for several years have recently been able to move into the animal husbandry institutes of various universities in the interior, and the government's concentrated promotion of scientific farming is very strong. Chinese farmers raising livestock are definitely not fools.

### Unprecedented Grand Event at the Metropolitan: Dozens of Dance Troupes Perform for Three Days

The Metropolitan Garden Ballroom at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Gordon Road in this city is scheduled to hold a three-day anniversary celebration and entertainment convention from the 9th to the 11th of this month. Preparations began more than a month ago. To promote Chinese art, dozens of local art and dance troupes have been rigorously selected. During these three days, the performances will run continuously from 4:00 PM until closing time. On the 10th at 11:00 PM, there will be a standard dance championship awards ceremony. The famous Kunqu opera performer, Ms. Wang Xichun, has been invited to present the awards. On this day, major Chinese and foreign manufacturers will be giving away excellent products at the hall. The hall has been busy decorating and preparing everything in recent days. It will be an unprecedented grand event in Shanghai. It is expected that it will cause a sensation at the time. It is also said that a special fourth-anniversary publication will be published. The content is very exciting and will be distributed to the guests on this day.

### Each Gap in North Jiangxi Road: Rumor Has It Will Be Blocked Periodically; That Section Does Not Connect to Hongkou; Rumors of Opening Three Places on Haining Road are Untrue

The area of shops, residences and alleys of North Jiangxi Road, which starts from the north side of the tap water bridge in the south, and ends at the east side of Old Bazai Road in the north, have been blocked by the Japanese with wooden poles and barbed wire since the 29th of last month, and have not yet been removed. Yesterday morning, it was claimed that there were

Japanese Soldier Sentry Posts

at the blocked gap on Haining Road. There are no Japanese sentries stationed at the Wenjianshi Road gap, but the Japanese have set up cloth sheds in the blocked area at the east end of the road to issue permits that are only valid for two months to residents living in the area. Residents living in the area speculate that the

Blocked Gap

that is currently retained will eventually be blocked on the 10th of this month. However, the gap in Haining Road is still expected to be opened at that time. However, at that time, entry and exit will be based on permits. Although entry into the newly blocked area is still free now, it is only from the east side of North Sichuan Road to the west side of North Jiangxi Road.

New Blocked Area

Near North Sichuan Road, there are other obstacles. Therefore, residents of Hongkou still have to use Sichuan Road Bridge and Chongming Road to enter and exit. It is a misunderstanding that the Japanese have opened three places, including Haining Road, to facilitate the entry and exit of residents living in the Hongkou area. Also, the Old Bazai Road gap is not open.

### Cereal Exchange: Access More Restricted Than Before; The Police Are Aiming to Maintain Order in the Vicinity; However, Family Members of the Members are Extremely Panicked and Request Flexibility

Since the French Concession's Mailan police station implemented emergency security measures at the Cereals and Oilseed Exchange at 15 Edward Road in this city, they have dispatched detectives to guard the exchange and have regulated the opening and closing times of the exchange's iron gate. The gate is opened at 8:00 AM, locked again at 11:00 AM at noon, reopened at 1:30 PM, and locked at 7:00 PM, cutting off passage. The detectives take the key. Entry and exit are based on the exchange certificate. If they do not have the exchange certificate, they will be rejected. This has caused more than 100 members and their families living in the exchange to be unable to move freely. The back door of the exchange has also been blocked for a long time, and only one large door is used to enter and exit. Now that it is blocked, if there is a fire or a sudden illness, they will inevitably sit and wait for death. Moreover, children's access to school, purchasing food, and emptying chamber pots are all hindered, causing great difficulties. They have jointly written to the French Concession Police Department and the Chinese Ratepayers Association, stating the reasons and requesting a change in the opening and closing times of the exchange gate, from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM, without locking it at noon, in order to facilitate entry and exit. The French Concession Police Department has not yet responded to the letter. The police are enforcing stricter restrictions on entry and exit than before. According to a gentleman from the exchange who spoke to the Daguang News Agency reporter yesterday, the police have announced that starting today, women and children will not be allowed to enter or exit. Therefore, more than 100 members and their families are quite panicked and are preparing to petition relevant public organizations today, requesting them to request flexibility on their behalf.

### Haikou Blockade Disrupts Transportation, Dyeing and Weaving Industry Suffers Stagnation, Over Two Hundred Businesses Concentrated in Western Shanghai Are Exerting Efforts to Dredge Sales Channels

Shanghai is the general hub of the international commercial arena. Commerce is prosperous. In recent years, the population of Shanghai has increased dramatically, and the demand for daily necessities has expanded. Leaders in the dyeing and weaving industry, in order to adapt to the times, have raised funds to establish factories, and the number of factories starting operations and shipping goods has sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. At that time, transportation was smooth and raw materials were cheap, and profits were quite high for a time. Expansion was rapid, and in order to protect the rights and interests of the industry, the Shanghai Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association was established.

Concentrated in Western Shanghai

With the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the factory areas of Hongkou, Yangshupu, Zhabei, Pudong, and Nanshi were designated as war zones. In addition to temporarily dismissing all workers and ceasing operations, the factories did not have time to move out all their machinery and assets. By the time the national army moved west and the city recovered, the machinery and assets had been destroyed. Therefore, the losses of the dyeing and weaving factories were enormous. Subsequently, because refugees from the suburbs and other places flocked to Shanghai, the population of Shanghai increased dramatically, and the cloth business flourished. Thereupon, the factories independently found ways to build factories and start operations in safe areas within the concession, such as the French Concession in western Shanghai, to meet market demand. Business was still decent, and although the price of raw materials trended upwards, profits were still high. According to a report from the industry association, as of now, there are still 190 national product dyeing and weaving factories that have joined the association, and more than 20 that have not joined, mostly concentrated in the western Shanghai area, with capital ranging from a maximum of two million yuan to a minimum of four or five thousand yuan.

Stagnation of Sales Channels

Because the war zone is expanding daily, the seaports in various places are being blockaded, transportation is obstructed, and shipping is suspended, resulting in stagnation of sales to out-of-town customers. Currently, except for Kunming and other places where large quantities are still being shipped, other places have been cut off. In addition, raw materials are blocked from being transported to Shanghai, and selling prices are trending upwards. The business of large and small dyeing and weaving factories has sharply declined, shortening working hours and reducing production. However, the leaders of the industry's factories have repeatedly tried to dredge up sales to out-of-town customers in an attempt to save the precarious situation. However, the sales channels of the local stores are unaffected, remaining the same as in the past. The products of national product dyeing and weaving factories are mostly twill fabrics, coarse and fine plain fabrics, "baoji," satin, and various cotton fabrics by the bolt, indanthrene cloth details, raw-color twill, standard color cloth, modern blue cloth, etc. The buyers of these types of cloth are mostly ordinary people, so those who buy whole bolts are quite few.

### Salt Reclamation Expert Jiang Zhiyuan Memorial Service

Jiang Zhiyuan of Wuyuan was a pioneer in the salt reclamation industry. He assisted Mr. Zhang Jian'an of Nantong in establishing the reclamation and animal husbandry company, reclaiming wasteland and developing it, with remarkable results. Recently, due to weakening health, he passed away in Shanghai on July 4th. Colleagues from various industrial companies in Nantong and various salt reclamation companies in Huainan, believing that Jiang's contributions benefited the people's livelihood, specially initiated a memorial service, scheduled for the morning of August 7th (Monday) at the Jade Buddha Temple on Binlang Road.

### Fire on Carter Road Kills Eight People, Big and Small; Film Catches Fire on First Floor, Uncontrollable, Burns Through Staircase, Tenants Upstairs Perish

Number 6, Renchang Lane, 214 Carter Road, Songshan Road, in the French Concession, is a three-story building with two side rooms. The second landlord, Zhang Bingsheng, a native of Huzhou, 40 years old, lived on the entire first floor and also ran the "Happy Forest Film Company" inside, with many old films piled up in the house, and had fire insurance. The upstairs living room was rented to the family of Zhang Baotang (号 Xunnan), a native of Fengxian who practiced law in Shanghai. The east side room was rented to a family surnamed Li, and the west side room was rented to Zhang Chuqing, a native of Ningbo (associate manager at the Ruifeng Lumber Company in Nanshi), and his son Zhang Wenbin. At a quarter past four in the afternoon the day before yesterday, the films piled up in the "Happy Forest Film Company" of the second landlord on the first floor suddenly caught fire. Because the weather has been dry recently, and the films were all made of rosin, the fire broke out at a touch and was uncontrollable, instantly bursting through the floorboards and out the roof. At that time, only the second landlord's entire family and the tenant surnamed Li in the east side room upstairs escaped. Zhang Wangshi (46 years old, native of Ningbo), wife of Zhang Chuqing in the west side room upstairs, and her daughter Xiu'e (12 years old), Xiao Mao (5 years old), and nephew Wang Zhongfu (6 years old), a family of four, and Zhang Zhu Surong (28 years old, native of Wuxi), wife of Zhang Baotang in the living room upstairs, her daughter Xiao Gou (2 years old), and wet nurse Li Cuiying (22 years old, native of Jiangwan), and another maid (name unknown, over 40 years old, native of Ningbo), a total of eight people, all died in the fire because the staircase was burned through and they were blocked by the thick flames and could not escape. Only Zhang Wenbin's wife, daughter-in-law of Zhang Chuqing, was pregnant and nearly due, and fortunately discovered the fire early and was able to escape, but her hands and feet were injured. The fire had spread to the residence of the landlord at Number 7 next door. The fire brigade rushed to put out the fire, and it was extinguished after an hour, destroying two houses. Later, eight bodies, large and small, were dug out, all charred, with incomplete limbs, a terrible sight. At 7:00 AM yesterday, the police station sent detectives to transport the bodies to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. Yesterday was a regular Sunday holiday, and they will report to the Second Special Court today to send personnel for inspection. Meanwhile, the police station will summon Zhang Bingsheng, the fire starter, to investigate the cause of the fire and handle it accordingly.

### Dispute Over Rental of Carter Theatre; Dong Zhaobin Leads Crowd to Question, Russian Doormen Beaten

The Carter Theatre on Carter Road was originally rented by Zhong Dingchen from the landlord. Later, Zhong subleased it to Dong Zhaobin for business, with a written lease agreement. It is now known that because the lease term has expired and Dong Zhaobin has not fully paid the rent, Zhong Dingchen locked the theatre and notified him to move out. Dong was unwilling to comply, and at 10:30 yesterday morning, he went with his friends to question Zhong. At that time, the crowd that gathered numbered nearly two or three hundred people. For a time, there were many people talking at once, and a few people entered the gate of the theatre. The two Russian doormen hired by the theatre were injured in the chaos, one with a head injury and one with a chest injury. Liang Heshang, the chauffeur of Zhong Dingchen, was also injured by the people sent by Dong, with two axe wounds on his arm and iron instrument injuries on his leg. The police station received the news and sent officers to the scene, and the people dispersed in all directions. The three injured people were sent to the police hospital for treatment.

### Robbery Gang Trial Concludes, Twenty-Three Cases, Sentencing Scheduled for the Eleventh

The Public Concession Police Department successively arrested a large number of robbers, kidnappers, and murderers, including Chen Yuansheng, Jiang Liansheng, Zhang Shaole, Sun Yaowu, Gao Yunwen, and Xiang Chenshi, seventeen people in total, and suspects Ren Maotou, Chuan Lishi, Wang Zhoushi, etc., twelve people in total, at the Wu Gong, Daxin, Dongfang, and Da Zhonghua hotels at the beginning of last month. They also seized five pistols, more than fifty rounds of ammunition, and two hand grenades, and took them all to the police station for detention and investigation. During the investigation, the defendant Chen Wusheng and others originally confessed that from May 2nd of this year to the date of their arrest, they had continuously committed seven crimes in the Public Concession. Yang Shunkang and Ming Shanxiang confessed that on the 2nd of last month, they were ordered by Xu Wen'an, captain of the bodyguard team of a mansion at Number 6, Lane 95, Dingpan Road, to fire shots at the Chinese and Western police on that road. Jiang Liansheng confessed to organizing a gang with the intention of kidnapping the three-year-old son of Zhou Baoqing, but failed. The defendants also admitted to more than ten robbery cases. Recently, the police department further ascertained that the defendant Chen Wusheng and others had committed six crimes. Regarding the twelve suspects, including Ren Mao and Li Chuan, they have been reported to the First Special Court for approval to be released. After filing a public prosecution against the seventeen defendants, Chen Wusheng, Xiang Chenshi, male and female, for crimes such as robbery and attempted kidnapping, Judge Jiang held a special court trial yesterday and concluded the case. All the defendants were returned to custody, and the sentencing is scheduled for the 11th of this month.

### Foreman Contracted to Repair the "Izumo" Warship Was Intimidated for Money; Two People Arrested Confess to Borrowing Military Funds

Tang Adong, who works as a foreman at a shipyard in Yangshupu, residing at Number 25, Huayuanfang, Jin Shenfu Road, was suddenly visited on the 12th of last month by Xie Ronggen (32 years old) and Wang Kechang (30 years old), both natives of Pudong who claimed to be members of the Pudong Guerrilla Force. They told Tang that they had been ordered by their superiors to come and borrow military funds, etc. Tang immediately reported to the police station, which sent detectives to arrest Xie and Wang and escort them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. The day before yesterday, Judge Liao held a court hearing for interrogation.顧守熙 Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Authority, filed a lawsuit on charges of intimidation and fraud, and stated that the plaintiff had previously received five or six threatening letters, all using the name of the guerrilla force, in an attempt to extort money. This defendant directly went to the plaintiff's home to extort money. He requested that the case be handled according to the law. When questioned, the two defendants, Xie and Wang, confessed that after the August 13th Incident, after the Japanese "Izumo" warship was damaged by the national army, the plaintiff independently contracted to repair it and made a lot of profit. Therefore, their captain, Qian Changgen, sent a letter to the plaintiff to discuss borrowing military funds. They were informed by the people, went privately to the plaintiff's home to report, and planned to get rewards. They did not dare to intimidate. The rest of their words were evasive. The court reviewed the confession and decided to postpone the hearing. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Jin Xingen Was Slashed in Front of the Da Zhonghua Hotel; Face Was Cut Three Times; Assailant Escaped

Jin Xingen, a local man, 40 years old, living in Xujiahui in the French Concession, usually occupied an evil force. Around 2:00 PM yesterday, Jin Xingen, wearing a Western suit, was walking near the Da Zhonghua Hotel at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Yu Qiaqing Road when he was suddenly attacked by three thugs who jumped out from the side of the road and slashed his face three times. Jin fell to the ground in pain. Seeing that they had achieved their goal, the assailants fled immediately. The nearby police officers at the intersection rushed over, but the assailants had already escaped. They quickly sent the injured person to Renji Hospital for treatment and reported back to the police station to pursue the assailants. It is learned that Jin Xingen has been very active in western Shanghai recently.

### Large Number of Decent Women Forced into Prostitution; Five Madams Arrested

Yang Laoer, Zhang Zhangshi, and others, women from Ningbo, were arrested for opening a brothel at Number 9, Lane 158, Yunnan Road, and inducing and abducting decent women to force them into prostitution. The Lao Zha Police Department detected this and ordered Chinese and Western detectives to arrest them at the address. In addition to the two women, Yang and Zhang, the accomplices Chen Wei'an, Chen Shenshi, and Wang Fanshi were also arrested. The victims, Li Jinnü (also known as Li Zhenmei, 18 years old, native of Tongzhou), Wang Yuezhen (23 years old, native of Changshu), Dong Xiao (also known as Chen Zhenbao, 16 years old, native of Suzhou), Dong Sannü (also known as Chen Jinnü, 16 years old, native of Suzhou), Gu Zhendi (also known as Chen Judi, 16 years old, native of Yangzhou), Chen Yuezhen (17 years old, native of Jiangyin), and Shen Yueying (also known as Ye Hongyang, 16 years old, native of Suzhou), seven people in total, were rescued. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the First Special Court, Criminal Division One, and prosecuted for the crime of harming public morals under Article 231 of the Criminal Law. After a brief interrogation by the judge, they were ordered to return the defendants to custody and await further verification at a later date. The victims, Li Jinnü, and others, were temporarily adopted by the Jiliang Institute.

### German Expatriate Kills Mistress Out of Love; Charged with Murder

Haimaina Lanya, a German expatriate, about 40 years old, killed his lover, 法桑 (transliteration), with a razor at Number 915, Avenue Joffre, last month after discovering that his lover had another lover. He attempted suicide but failed and was arrested by the French Concession Police Department. He was recently escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court and charged with murder. Judge Liao ascended the bench for interrogation. The defendant Haimaina Lanya confessed that because he discovered that 法桑 had another lover, he asked her to clearly state whether she would marry him in the future, but she did not give a specific answer. He bought suicide drugs and a razor, intending to commit suicide after killing her, but he later abandoned this plan and only wanted to warn her, or commit suicide himself, and had no intention of killing her. The court reviewed the confession and ordered the start of arguments.顧守熙, a lawyer representing the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated that the Concession Administrative Authority prosecuted the defendant for murder, and the defendant's criminal behavior was very obvious, and the defendant did not die. The defendant was jealous because of adultery, and because of jealousy, he committed murder. According to the law, the defendant should be held responsible for the crime of murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law and requested the presiding judge to sentence him according to the law. The defendant's defense lawyer then stated his opinion, saying that the victim's behavior was vile, which several people could prove, and requested the court to postpone the hearing and summon witnesses for cross-examination in order to understand the truth of the case. The court then approved the suspension of arguments and postponed the hearing to the 19th of this month to await the summoning of witnesses for further interrogation.

### Geng Yu Li and Along the Road

The houses in Geng Yu Li and along the road on Rue Poupard in the French Concession are owned by Song Ziqing, a Catholic. Last month, the Dehe Foreign Firm, the real estate agent for the lane, suddenly sent letters to the tenants, stating that from August, the rent for single-family houses would be increased by five yuan, and the rent for double-family houses would be increased by ten yuan, and each household would be required to install its own water meter, and all water fees and water meter deposits would also be borne by the tenants, etc. After receiving the notice, the tenants in the lane unanimously believed that at this extraordinary time, when prices of all goods were soaring, it was unbearable to be subjected to further residential oppression. They jointly sent a letter to the foreign firm, stating the tenants' difficulties and firmly refusing to increase the rent. They convened a general meeting, elected representatives, and sent letters to the Police Department of the French Municipal Council and the French Water and Electricity Company, etc., appealing for help. Meanwhile, they hired three lawyers, Li Ming, Zhang Yiping, and Xu Yin, to proceed according to the law. It is now learned that the rent for all households in the lane has been deposited in the Bank of China uniformly, and they will not stop until the goal of stopping the rent increase and abolishing the installation of water meters is achieved.

### Dutch Consulate Holds Banquet to Celebrate the Birth of the Princess's Daughter; Today at Noon at the Union Club on Xiejiao Road to Celebrate the Health of the Princess and Her Daughter

Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth to a daughter on the morning of the 5th at Soestdijk Palace, which greatly disappointed the Dutch people, who had hoped for a male heir for a century. The child was born at 1:09 PM, a very strong infant, weighing eight and a half pounds. The mother and daughter are now both healthy. The Dutch Consul in this city, 鲍赛汶 Bao Saiwen, decided to hold a banquet at the Union Club on Xiejiao Road, Jing'an Temple Road, at 12:00 noon today to celebrate the birth of the daughter and the health of the princess and her daughter.

### Muslims Commemorate Su Zixiang This Morning at Chunhua Restaurant

No less than 100,000 Muslims reside in this city, and most of them are poor. Their children mostly drop out of school. Recently, 陳經會 Chen Jinghui, 楊叔平 Yang Shuping, and others have initiated a scholarship fund for the poor, and have already raised a certain amount. Su Zixiang, one of the initiators, also generously donated 500 yuan. Unfortunately, he passed away recently. Because Mr. Su was enthusiastic about education, fellow Muslims decided to hold a memorial service at Chunhua Restaurant on Daxin Street at 10:00 AM today to commemorate him. They also asked Mr. Su's relatives and friends to convert all gifts into cash to supplement the fund so as to benefit the poor. The Isolated Battalion, from June 25th to July, received慰勞 condolence cash and goods, etc., a total of 20 cases. Cash慰勞 condolences included the Guangyu Association, which慰贈 presented a total of 124 yuan, and the Chinese police officers of the Putuo Road Police Department, who慰贈 presented 3 yuan and 6 jiao. Zhang Yingjie raised 20 yuan.

### Do Not Waste Extravagantly

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the National Government recently consulted the provincial governments of various provinces, saying that the Executive Committee of Meishan County, Sichuan Province, suggested that the price of paper has recently risen in various places, increasing daily, which has become a panic phenomenon. The reason for this is that the demand is vast and supply is insufficient, and also because of the lack of raw materials, which are difficult to supply. Even if everyone saves and specializes in cultural undertakings, it may not be enough to allocate. It has been found that people in various places are accustomed to old habits, and every year at the end of the year, New Year's, Qingming, and Qiban, they all use paper as a necessary item to commemorate their ancestors. Various religious associations and chanting sutras and reciting Buddha names also consider it an indispensable ritual to worship gods, using useful paper for useless consumption. If this continues, without thinking of ways to remedy the situation, the impact on the future of the War of Resistance will be far from insignificant. On the days of the end of the year, New Year's, Qingming, Qiban, and family anniversaries, the parents will convene a family meeting to commemorate (or name it the "Chasing Remembrance Festival"). After respectfully reading the party member's code of conduct, they will continue to explain that the ancestors' entrepreneurship was difficult and the descendants' preservation is not easy, imbuing the remembrance of ancestors with the intention of alerting future generations, neither wasting money nor consuming paper, and also making up for the paper shortage in various places, which is specially requested to be corrected. In addition, the raw materials for papermaking in various places are mostly taken from bamboo villages, and ordinary ignorant people, or greedy for temporary food, trying to gain small immediate benefits, often arbitrarily cut down new bamboo shoots. In the future, new bamboo shoots should also be advised not to be cut down indiscriminately.

### Leather Goods Workers Demand Wage Increase

Workers in the leather goods industry in this city, because the prices of everything in Shanghai have recently soared and the cost of living has risen, find it difficult to maintain a living with their original wages. Therefore, various industries have successively increased wages, but the employers in this industry have not yet expressed any intention. The industry association recently issued a public notice to raise prices by 30%. For this reason, they specially elected representatives Zhu Bingcai, Wu Yajun, Jiang Shanliang, and others to petition the association, requesting a 30% wage increase to maintain their livelihoods. The association promised to seek the opinions of its members before replying and advised the workers to wait patiently for a legal resolution.

### Thug Shot Dead

Cai Dehong, a thug from Ningbo nicknamed Lao Luan Adong, 27 years old, residing at Number 186, Gui'an Lane, North Chujia Bridge, Min體尼蔭 Road, was involved in a fight with others at Number 178, North End, 格洛克路 Glock Road, around 12:00 PM on the 5th, resulting in being shot in the stomach by the other party. The assailant immediately fled. Afterwards, Cai surrendered himself to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital reported to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. Cai died of his injuries at noon yesterday. The French police station transported the body to the autopsy room for reporting and autopsy.

### Mistakenly Swallows Poison; Dies

Inside Number 396, Rue Méquignon, there is a boy, Zhou Cunbao (11 years old), whose father makes pen nibs for a living. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the boy mistakenly swallowed the poisonous liquid used by his father to make pen nibs, and suddenly felt severe abdominal pain, fainted, and lost consciousness. His family hurriedly hired a car and sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but he died soon after due to severe poisoning.

### Woman Hangs Herself from Tree

On a large tree in the garden of a certain residence at Number 116, near康腦脫路 Connaught Road, on Avenue Joffre, at about 6:00 AM yesterday, the body of a woman, about 30 years old, wearing a short black muslin shirt and trousers, was found hanging herself. It was immediately taken down and sent to the Red Cross Hospital. After inspection by the doctor, the woman had been dead for a long time. The body was transferred to the autopsy room awaiting autopsy.

### Weather Report

Traffic and Transportation

### Procedures for Studying in the United States (Continued)

— 星

After Arriving in the United States

Taking a train from San Francisco or Seattle to the eastern United States, a coach seat is more economical, but there is no sleeper berth at night, and passengers sitting in coach seats must pay extra freight if their luggage exceeds 150 pounds. The calculation of freight is also very expensive. If there is too much luggage, it does not seem worth it. However, passengers traveling in tourist class can transport 350 pounds without extra charge (when buying a ticket and checking luggage, you must specify "Transpacific"). Coach seats are fine for short trips, but it takes two days and three nights from the west coast to Chicago. Without a sleeper berth, it is not very comfortable. There are no tourist sleeper cars east of Chicago. Ordinary sleeper cars are 50% more expensive than coach seats, and a sleeper berth fee must be added. However, this section is not a long distance, at most one day and night, and sitting in a coach seat will not feel too hard.

The things needed on the train are just changes of clothes, pajamas, and daily necessities. There is no need to bring a lot of luggage. Now, most new cars have air and temperature control, so it is not too cold or too hot. Heavy luggage can be delivered directly to the final destination by the railway company. It does not matter if you stop for a few days on the way. At most, there will be a slight baggage storage fee (usually, if it exceeds 24 hours, it is 15 cents a day for each large item). Shipping luggage is not very troublesome. You can deliver it to a transfer company at the wharf and have it sent to the train station. If the train is not scheduled, you can also hand it over to the transfer company for temporary storage, keep the receipt yourself, and call the transfer company to deliver the luggage to the station after you have purchased the ticket. Exchange it for a train baggage ticket when you arrive at the station. If the procedures are not very clear, you can ask the person in charge of the railway company or entrust him to handle it on your behalf. After arriving at the destination and finding a place to live, you can hand over the baggage ticket to the local transfer company (usually near the station) to deliver it to your residence. The transfer fee is priced based on the size of the city, usually from 25 cents to one dollar for a large item.

To eat on the train, you can go to the dining car. The prices vary by railway. It is cheaper to eat Platelunch, usually 30 to 50 cents. For à la carte dishes, you can choose one or two items from the dishes listed on the menu. Do not eat like you did on the ship, not only is the price too high, but it is not the way Americans usually eat. The waiter's tip in the dining car is 10% of the meal cost. Sometimes the food in the dining car is too expensive. Someone sells food on the car at each meal, which you can buy. The price is cheaper. Sandwiches, toast, milk, and coffee are the most common foods. Sometimes the train stops at a larger station, and you can get off the train to eat, but because of time constraints, you can only use sandwiches, etc. Of course, you can also eat ordinary meals when the train stops for a long time. Although you can also buy things and bring them on the train yourself, it is not very dignified. In any case, do not litter paper scraps, etc., to avoid being despised. Some students sometimes eat more expensive things because they are afraid of being looked down upon. In fact, Americans are not afraid of talking about being poor, but look down on those who waste money indiscriminately (Americans call them "Sucker"). There is a smoking room available. You cannot smoke at will on the car seat. Travelers must pay attention to this.

In addition to taking the train, you can also take a long-distance bus. These buses also have sleeper berths, air conditioning, and other equipment, but they are not as comfortable as trains. The fare from San Francisco to Chicago is only five or six yuan cheaper than a coach seat on the train, which is not very worthwhile. On the other hand, for short trips, usually within three or four hundred miles, which takes no more than ten hours, there is the advantage of enjoying the scenery. Also, the cities passed through are mostly on the main streets, and you can hardly see the city when taking the train. Unless you divide it into several sections, it is too hard to take a long-distance bus for a long trip.

Whether you take the train or the bus, if a friend is picking you up at your destination, you can send a telegram in advance. A night letter is delivered the morning after it is sent. Each letter can type 50 words (name and address not included), which is cheaper. This type of telegram can be sent at the station before the train leaves or when the train stops. If you are not familiar with it, you can ask the waiter on the train to handle it for you. For the first time going abroad, it can save a lot of trouble if someone takes care of everything when you arrive at your destination!

### Local Transportation Agencies Increase Fares

Since the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates and the increase in gasoline prices, transportation businesses in this city have felt significant losses. The Transportation Association convened a meeting of its members at the beginning of last month to discuss countermeasures. After deliberation, it was decided that all fares would be increased by 30% of the original price, effective immediately. However, with gasoline prices continuing to rise, it was still impossible to maintain costs, and transportation companies had no choice but to raise prices again to protect their capital. We have inquired with the China Travel Service and the Huafu Transportation Company, a long-established and large-scale local firm, about their price increases, and the details are recorded as follows: The original price for the China Travel Service's import and export luggage was 60 cents per piece, 55 cents per piece for 21 or more pieces, 50 cents per piece for 31 or more pieces, 45 cents per piece for 51 or more pieces, 40 cents per piece for 71 or more pieces, with a minimum freight charge of one dollar. Currently, only import luggage is still charged at the original price in order to alleviate difficulties for travelers and at the expense of their own capital. All export luggage, however, has had its price revised from August 1st, as follows: 70 cents per piece, with a minimum of two dollars. 65 cents per piece for 21 or more pieces; 55 cents per piece for 31 or more pieces; 50 cents per piece for 51 or more pieces; 45 cents per piece for 71 or more pieces up to 100 pieces. For large quantities of luggage, prices are negotiable. Observing the above prices, the freight increase per piece is less than 20% of the original price, which differs from other companies. Huafu Transportation Company had increased its prices by 20% of the original price at the beginning of July, but because it still could not maintain costs, it had to increase prices again by 20% after the middle of last month. Therefore, a truck that used to cost five dollars per hour is now seven dollars per hour. The transportation of cotton yarn, which was previously calculated at 35 cents per piece, has now increased to 40 cents per piece, an increase of less than 20%. It is reported that the freight increase for other companies is around 30%.

### Travel Q&A

(Answer) To Mr. Zhou Jigen: 1. The free baggage allowance on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is 30 kilograms. For each 100 kilograms of excess baggage, the charge is 32 Vietnamese piastres (approximately 16 piastres for fourth class). Baggage less than 100 kilograms will be charged proportionally. 2. It is advisable not to bring a camera when passing through Vietnam. 3. The fare for the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is 30.55 Vietnamese piastres per person for third class and 10.65 Vietnamese piastres for fourth class (one Vietnamese piastre is equivalent to approximately 3.40 national currency).

(Answer) To Mr. Qin En: 1. For a small package of newly purchased daily necessities, it is advisable to send it by mail if it is not carried with you. If the items are personal belongings and the quantity is not large, you will only need to pay taxes upon arrival in Vietnam and will not be penalized. Food items are tax-free. 2. The exchange rate between Hong Kong dollars and Vietnamese piastres is about the same locally as in Shanghai. It is better to exchange them in Shanghai in advance. 3. There will be no problem when disembarking in Haiphong, even if the smallpox vaccination you received did not take.

(Answer) To Mr. Shi Jiegeng: 1. A railway service certificate is used for identification purposes. 2. The best route from Hengyang to Guiyang is to take the Hunan-Guangxi Railway to Guilin (5.25 yuan for third class), then take the highway from Guilin to Liuzhou (10.90 yuan for the bus ticket), and then take the Southwest Highway to Guiyang (31.60 yuan for the ticket). It is said that the route via Changsha to Guiyang is currently not very smooth.

(Answer) To Mr. Wang Nianyuan: 1. There is no problem wearing Chinese clothing within Vietnam when traveling through Vietnam to the interior. Also, Vietnamese customs will waive taxes on newly purchased Chinese clothing in your luggage. 2. When requesting the French consulate to countersign a transit visa on your passport, you must provide a letter of guarantee issued by a reputable local business. If not, you must pay a cash deposit of 100 Vietnamese piastres as security. 3. A small amount of medication is subject to tax according to regulations, but it may be possible to make temporary arrangements. 4. The cabin fare from Shanghai to Fangfang is 82 yuan per person. The third-class train fare from Haiphong to Kunming is equivalent to 104 yuan in national currency per person. The airfare from Kunming to Chongqing is 270 yuan in national currency, including food and lodging along the way. Carrying 500 yuan in national currency for travel expenses may not be sufficient. 5. The China Travel Service has a reception desk at the Haiphong pier to assist travelers.

(Answer) To Mr. Zhang Qihua: 1. If the fare for taking the Italian-French postal ship from Shanghai to Singapore is too expensive, you can take a Swire Shipping Company ship instead, which is more economical. The steerage fare for this company is calculated in two sections. From Shanghai to Hong Kong is 24 yuan in national currency per person, and from Hong Kong to Singapore is 45 Hong Kong dollars per person (equivalent to over 150 yuan in national currency).

### Reply to Readers

— Deng Bingquan

After announcing the temporary suspension of publication last week, this publication originally intended to publish inland transportation news in this newspaper at any time, to ensure timeliness. However, we have received many letters of criticism from readers, some saying that the original articles have not yet been completed, others saying that the travel Q&A has not been fully completed, and at the very least, the existing manuscripts and letters should be brought to a conclusion. This company is grateful for the earnest supervision and guidance of readers and is even more aware of the regret of incomplete service. Therefore, we have discussed the public opinion with the Shen Bao authorities and requested a small amount of space for a short period of effort. Fortunately, the Shen Bao agreed and changed the publication to every Monday. This publication announced the suspension of publication last week, but today we meet with readers again. In fact, the week was never interrupted.

This company has agreed with the Shen Bao to publish six more issues. The unfinished articles will be published as much as possible, and the travel Q&A will also answer each of the existing letters one by one, to live up to the expectations of all parties. For those who have new travel questions to ask, please send them directly to this company, and we will reply at any time and no longer publish them in the newspaper. We respectfully announce this and ask for your understanding.

Economic Supplement

### The Future of the Japanese Economy (Continued)

— Translated by Ms. Feng Meiqi

Japan’s Economic Outlook, by T.A. Bisson, Foreign

Policy Reports, Vol. XV, No. 7 Jun. 15, 1939

Table (II) Government Bonds Held by the Bank of Japan (in thousands of yen)

As of the end of December 1938, in addition to government bonds of 14,934,733,000 yen, there were outstanding foreign debts of 1,287,994,000 yen (approximately 2,500 million yen after revaluation of debts) and government rice purchase bonds of 423,032,000 yen. Therefore, the government debt has reached 18,000 million yen, far exceeding the usual estimate of national income. If the national income of Japan in 1938 was 20,000 million yen, the figures for public debt and taxes will still be very large in its expenditure items.

The decision is the problem of paper currency circulation. Since 1931, the paper currency issued by the Bank of Japan has continued to increase, especially after 1936, as shown in Table (III). The figures are the actual amount of Bank of Japan paper currency in circulation. The tens of millions of yen in Bank of Japan paper currency held by the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Taiwan as currency reserves are not included. Since 1931, the increase in circulating currency has been synchronized with the recovery of production, but after 1938, the increase in currency issuance has far exceeded its industrial production.

In 1938, the increase in Japan's production has gradually slowed down. The increase was only 0.9%. The increase in the general index of production has been lower than the increase rate of the previous year. The divergence between production goods and consumer goods has become more and more obvious. The production goods side is still able to maintain the previous increase rate, but the consumer goods side has fallen by 8%. From this, it can be seen that it is not easy for Japan to increase production to meet the needs of the war.

Table (III) Circulating Currency and Industrial Production Amount of Bank of Japan Paper Currency Issued Index of Industrial Production Volume (millions of yen) (monthly average, 1931-1937 200)

In 1938, Japan's agricultural production decreased greatly, mainly due to the transfer of rural labor to military service. According to official estimates, the decrease in rice harvest is smaller than in other areas. The decrease in silkworm cocoon production was 1 million Kwan or 12.5%. The harvest of grains also decreased significantly. Wheat decreased from 9.4 million Kwan to 8.9 million; barley decreased from 6.9 million to 6.3 million; hulless barley decreased from 6.1 million to 5.1 million.

The above figures are sufficient to show the sharp reduction in the supply of consumer goods, and the reduction in the supply of agricultural production is also significant, but not as significant as the former. On the other hand, monetary wages have increased significantly. The index of factory employees in November of 1936, 1937, and 1938 was 105.5, 117.3, and 132.8. During the same period, the real wage index in factories was 91.8, 96.8, and 110.2. Although the harvest of grains was not good, due to the rise in prices, the net income of agricultural products increased slightly compared to the past. It is estimated that the income from agricultural products increased by 100 million yen compared to the previous year, from 3,654 in 1937 to 3,754 in 1938. However, at the same time, the supply of goods is becoming increasingly scarce. The Far Eastern Economic Review said: "Looking at the current situation, Japan will soon feel the shortage of daily necessities... Even if it does not create a serious situation, if the situation of supply falling short of demand continues to develop without a remedy to balance it, then the soaring of commodity prices will be expected."

In fact, prices have indeed risen higher than before. The average retail price index for 1936, 1937, and 1938 was 159, 174, and 191. In the same year, the average cost of living index was 185, 193, and 207. The registered index for both in December 1938 was 212, which shows that it is still increasing. The four items that increased the fastest were fuel, electricity, clothing, and food. Since July 1938, the prices of some commodities have been regulated by the government. At the same time, central and local governments also have committees to stipulate the statutory prices of some commodities and send thousands of "economic police" to be responsible for implementing them. However, the price index still rises afterwards, which proves that the official control capacity is not enough to resist the pressure of inflation.

The above various factors affect the standard of living of the people differently. Domestic large-scale commercial enterprises - especially munitions and heavy industry merchants - have made huge profits, some of which are over 20%; the dividends distributed are over 10%. On the other hand, some manufacturers of export industries have suffered serious blows. At the same time, the medium-sized manufacturing industries of domestic consumer goods have also been forced to reduce their scope. As a result, most of the laid-off workers have become unemployed because they do not have the skills to manufacture munitions. The official figure for the number of unemployed in March 1938 was 266,000; in fact, non-official estimates are three or four times higher. The wage rate of employed workers - especially heavy industry workers - is very high, but it is questionable whether the increase in their income can cope with the current high cost of living. Farmers have been greatly affected. It is estimated that the net income of agriculture in 1938 increased by only 100 million yen compared to the previous year, but this increase of 100 million cannot compensate for the general rise in prices. As a result, "a huge gap is created between the agricultural income index and the general price index." The agricultural income index was 101 in 1936, decreased to 93 in 1937, and is estimated to be 84 in 1938.

All of the above shows that every sector of the Japanese economy is becoming increasingly difficult. In today's complex economic system, we cannot determine its future, but what can be affirmed is that although the Japanese economy has not yet reached a serious crisis, there are signs of inflation, which is the result of the challenge to China. If the war zone is further expanded, the economic hardship in Japan will inevitably intensify.

International Economic Status

It is generally believed that Japan's external economic problems are more serious than its domestic economy. Japan's lack of natural resources is a major obstacle to industrial development. Raw materials such as cotton, wool, advanced machinery, and many important minerals must be imported from abroad. At present, during the war period, the demand for these raw materials is greater, so the import surplus of foreign trade is even greater.

From 1932 to 1936, Japan's trade once prospered. It is generally believed that the expansion of foreign trade at this time is sufficient to increase Japan's gold and foreign exchange reserves - this phenomenon occurred during the World War. In fact, although trade expanded from 1932 to 1936, the reserves did not increase. The annual import surplus was quite large - mainly due to Japan's military expansion plan and capital investment in "Manchukuo", as a result, the trade balance was not good.

In 1931, Japan's total foreign trade was 2,383 million yen, which was the lowest level since 1916. Since 1932 - as shown in Table (IV) - it began to rise, reaching its highest level in 1937, and then began to decline again. Now looking at the situation from 1932 to 1936: Japan's trade developed extremely significantly in these years. In 1934, it even exceeded the high level of 1929, and the total from 1935 to 1936 increased by 1 trillion yen. On the other hand, trade became a trade surplus in one year. However, the total import surplus in five years was 2,320 million yen.

Table (IV) Japan's Commodity Trade (millions of yen)

In addition to the trade deficit, Japan also exported huge amounts of capital, as shown in Table (V). During these years, Japan's capital investment abroad increased significantly. These two items are the two major items on Japan's expenditure account. On the income side, the main sources are the following three: public services, such as transportation, remittances, commercial and industrial profits; export of gold and silver; and the return of Japan's early investments abroad. The last item increased with the year. In 1935, the Japanese purchased silver privately exported from China at yen prices, which gave Japan huge unexpected benefits. There was no such income in 1936, but in that year, Japan's investment abroad reached 652.4 million yen. Gold has not been exported since it stopped being exported in 1933, but every effort has been made to recover foreign investment assets - reducing by 485 million yen in 1936.

Table (V) Net Difference in Japan's Balance of Payments (millions of yen)

From 1932 to 1936, Japan's national assets had an additional increase, and production efficiency also improved. On the other hand, Japan's international economic status declined day by day. The country's trade had a huge deficit, and a large amount of capital was also lost day by day. Most of this capital was invested in "Manchukuo", which was unprofitable or had no profits to be made recently, so the result was a significant loss.

By the beginning of 1937, Japan's foreign exchange and securities reserves gradually showed signs of depletion. On January 8, 1937, the Finance Minister proposed an approval system to control foreign exchange. Two months later, he began to export gold in large quantities. The trade deficit in the first half of the year was quite large, and then the Sino-Japanese War broke out suddenly in July and August, and the situation became even more serious. The authorities had no choice but to strengthen the control of imported goods and try to reduce the import of non-essential goods. In addition, they re-evaluated the gold reserves of the banks of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and proposed 1,548 million yen to maintain currency and adjust international accounts. Therefore, in 1937 and 1938, the war continued to expand, and the reason why the Japanese authorities were able to calmly cope with the needs of munitions was due to the effective control of foreign exchange and the effective use of gold.

In the past two years, Japan's commodity trade has also undergone great changes. As shown in Table (VI), trade in the Japanese Empire reached an unprecedented high level in 1937, but imports far exceeded exports, resulting in a trade deficit of 636 million yen. By 1938, imports were strictly restricted, and the import surplus was reduced by 1,119 million yen. Exports also decreased by 422 million yen due to the lack of raw material imports and the resistance from all over the world to Japan, resulting in a trade surplus of 600 million yen.

The above figures only refer to the foreign trade of Japan and its territories, and do not refer to the trade situation between Japan and its territories. The trade between Japan and its territories and "Manchukuo" has recently developed greatly. In 1937, the yen group included "Manchukuo" and its territories (Korea, Taiwan, and the South Seas Mandate), and in 1938, it also included parts of the Chinese coast and inland areas. Therefore, in the last year, the trade between China and Japan was also included in the yen group. From the "actual total" in Table (VI), it can be seen that the trade figures from 1937 to 1938 have been reorganized to make accurate estimates of the trade between Japan and the yen group, and the trade between Japan and countries with free exchange. In addition, there are also figures for 1936 to show the direction of changes in the two years.

Table (VI) Distribution of Japan's Trade (millions of yen)

(Note) (1) Foreign trade of Japan and its territories

(2) Trade between Japan and the world, Korea and Taiwan

From the above table, it can be seen that the development of Japan's trade within the yen group has slightly offset the trade deficit of Japan. The trade between Japan and countries with free exchange has a deficit of 329,926,574 million yen in the last three years. The deficit decreased by 352 million yen in 1938 alone. Exports to countries with free exchange decreased by 1,038 million (40.5%) in that year, and imports were forced to decrease by 1,390 million (39.8%), which shows the magnitude of the loss. In other words, the reduction of the 352 million yen deficit has resulted in the loss of two-fifths of Japan's trade with countries with free exchange (including imports and exports).

At the same time, Japan's trade situation within the yen group is also not good. In this aspect, Japan's imports from the yen group should exceed exports to make up for the shortage of Japan's production and reduce the import of foreign goods. In fact, it is the opposite. In 1938, the trade between Japan and the yen group had a surplus of 753 million yen. Among them, the main export was cotton textiles, which were made of imported raw cotton, so Japan's foreign exchange became even more strained. However, the import figures increased year by year, but the increase was slower; in 1938, its imports totaled 1,489 million yen, accounting for about one-third of Japan's total imports. The goods imported from the yen group countries to Japan are mostly food (rice, sugar, soybeans), followed by coal, iron, and a small amount of raw cotton wool. In addition, Japan needs to purchase machinery, oil, rubber, large quantities of metals, most of the raw cotton wool, and some semi-finished metal products from abroad. Since Japan's exports to countries with free exchange have gradually declined and its domestic gold reserves have gradually decreased, the import of these items has also become increasingly difficult.

The balance of Japan's international accounts in 1937 and 1938 depended on the export of coins and gold and silver bars. In recent years, the figures for Japan's invisible trade have been announced, and the number of gold and silver shipments is obtained from the statistics of the importing countries (mainly the United States). The export in 1937 was 892 million yen, and the export in 1938 was 634 million yen. And this export is roughly in line with Japan's import payments to countries with free exchange, with import payments of 926 million yen in 1937 and 574 million yen in 1938. Since Japan's imports are so large and must be paid for with gold exports, how long can Japan's gold reserves last?

Three-quarters of Japan's gold reserves were used to pay for foreign expenditures between 1937 and 1938. In total, Japan has had a total of 2.250 billion yen in gold in recent years, of which 1.550 billion yen was retained after the revaluation of gold, 400 million yen was stored abroad before the revaluation, and 300 million yen was produced within 18 months after the outbreak of the war. Its use was 1.450 billion yen shipped abroad, 300 million yen for import and export funds, and 500 million yen for the gold reserve of the Bank of Japan on January 1, 1939. As a result, Japan's net savings are only 500 million yen, and the estimated production amount for this year is 200 million yen. If Japan's trade with countries with free exchange cannot be improved, this 700 million yen of gold reserves will still be used to pay for international payments in 1939. Looking at the trade figures for the first few months of 1939, exports to countries with free exchange are still declining, and imports are maintaining the level of 1938, which shows that the trade balance has regressed and not progressed.

If the situation becomes more serious, Japan will undoubtedly seek help from other sources of foreign exchange. For example, imports from countries with free exchange can still be reduced; the raw materials needed for the war or export industries can be restricted more strictly; there are some items under foreign investment assets that can be used. Gold and silver jewelry in Japan have been forcibly collected, but they cannot exceed 50 or 60 million yen. Japan is currently unable to monopolize China's commerce. If the control of currency and foreign exchange in North China can be implemented, Japan can use the profits from foreign trade in that region to make up for its foreign exchange deficit. However, whether it will succeed is difficult to say. Since the Anglo-Japanese Agreement was signed, China's customs revenue has been transferred to the Yokohama Specie Bank. In 1938, Japan obtained 7.5 million yen in foreign exchange in this area. However, in the future, it is feared that the Japanese side will be paid in yen or local currency. Table (VI) shows that Japan's imports from mainland China were very small in 1938, accounting for less than 1%. The imports of raw cotton, coal, and iron have all declined greatly, and only salt is more important. At present, during the war period, China is not as much of an economic asset to Japan as "Manchukuo". And in 1938, Japan's exports to mainland China were several times its imports. Due to the chaotic currency situation, Japan's trade with China often causes its funds to escape to foreign concessions, and its accurate estimate is not available, but the amount must be small. (To be continued)

### Japanese Manpower Shortage

Japan needs a large army on the vast battlefields in China; under China's tactics of attrition warfare, the Japanese army has lost nearly a million men. The war zone is still expanding, but Japan's manpower is in a crisis of being unable to keep up. All the newspapers and magazines in Japan are full of discussions on countermeasures for the shortage of Japanese labor; factory owners do not hesitate to lure workers with high wages, and the government has to maintain the labor force of military factories with labor control; women workers bear the brunt in rural fishing and forestry due to the sharp reduction in labor; as a result, the sharp reduction in production is inevitable. More fatally, because most of the strong men have been forced to come to China and died one after another, most of the women in the country have become widows in disguise. The birth rate has been drastically reduced. At the same time, due to the extreme lack of domestic prices and the implementation of strict thrift, the health of the people has been greatly damaged, so the mortality rate is increasing instead. The following is the confession of his cabinet's statistics bureau.

### Finance: The Gold Market Was Not Open Yesterday, and the Mood of the Industry Turned Weary

Yesterday, the spot price of cash red chip trading was closed due to the weekly holiday, so there was no formal market price. However, according to the mood of the industry, it seemed to have turned slightly weary. It was heard that many positions were sold off-market, because it was reported that Britain, the United States, and France were about to cooperate to restrain Japan and aid China. Although it has not yet been implemented, it seems possible, and the situation in Germany and Poland is becoming increasingly tense, with a great sense of imminent danger, which inevitably dampened people's hearts slightly. It was heard that floating households commissioned money changers to sell at 3,840 yuan, but only a few buyers offered 3,820 yuan, so no transaction was heard. The exchange rate for gold jewelry in silver shops has not changed, with Da Tong Heng still quoting 390 yuan and Xin Tong Heng at 388 yuan, with a reduction of 20 yuan for purchases. Also, according to a London dispatch on the 5th, British pure gold was still at 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6.5 pence per ounce.

### Recent and Distant Silver Both Rise; Spot Silver Steady

London, 5th: The silver market saw Indian buying and short covering, keeping the market stable. Spot and forward silver both rose by 1.25. New York silver report: US spot prices remained steady. Bombay silver report: The Indian silver market was calm; spot prices continued to rise by four annas, while futures remained unchanged. A total of 100 contracts were traded, it is said.

### Sugar Market: Refined Sugar Strengthens

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to make progress. The guild marked up prices. Spot prices for No. 24 crude white sugar rose by 50 cents, to $33.50 at local godowns and $33.30 at foreign godowns. Re-export sugar rose by 22 cents, to $25.20. Taikoo granulated sugar rose by 45 cents, to $38.20 at East godowns and $38.45 at West godowns for B Mark, $38 for CW Mark, $37.70 for CX Mark, $37.40 at East godowns and 20 cents at West godowns for DY Mark, and $37.20 at West godowns for HX Mark. Dutch red sugar and red sugar remained unchanged. Local refined white sugar rose another 50 cents, to $33.50 for Zhenji No. 1, $33 for No. 2, $22.50 for No. 3, and $32 for No. 4. The state-owned sugar company only announced prices and did not make many changes, only offering 72 bags of Gao Banqing at $25.70.

### North-South Goods: New Haikou Lychee is on the Way

In previous years, Haikou dried lychees were the first new product to appear on the market. Due to transportation difficulties this year, they have been delayed. It is now reported that a small quantity has been shipped and is en route, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon, it is said.

### Both Branches and Lotus Seeds are Showing New Products

The first batch of new Lan Bamboo branches have some mold and need to be re-dried. The yield after drying is 95%, so the market price has been raised by $5 and is now selling for $85. It is also reported that a telegram was received from Zhangzhou stating that there may be a ban on exports. If this is not resolved, prices are expected to continue to rise.

New white lotus seeds from Lanxi have already arrived on the market. Five barrels have been transferred from Ningbo, but have not yet been released. They may be able to compete with Xiang lotus seeds.

### Sichuan Fungus Near $300

Sichuan fungus is currently experiencing a shortage of arrivals due to restrictions on exports, causing market prices to rise repeatedly. Yesterday, a batch was offered at a price of $290, an increase of more than $28. However, even if it were possible to import now, the cost of foreign exchange alone would require $180 in cash. Other expenses can be imagined. Therefore, the trend is expected to tighten further.

### Coal: Zhufeng Coal Sells Well; Uncertain that North China Coal Will be Shipped to Shanghai

Recently, there have been rumors in the market that a certain party will ship North China coal to Shanghai for dumping. However, after extensive inquiries by reporters, there is no evidence of this. Moreover, most of the coal stored in Pudong is supplied to the military by a certain party and is not for sale. Only a small amount of Zhufeng coal is being released by a certain foreign firm. The price of unified coal at Pudong godowns is $42 per ton, and lump coal is $46. Other high-quality coal, such as Pacific coal, is being held and is not expected to be sold, it is said.

### Seafood: Yellow Croaker Maw Soars

Yellow croaker maw has continued to be in demand recently. However, inventory is very low, spot prices are high, and selling prices are rising. The current market price for Ningbo hanging maw is $175, and local hanging maw is $200, a significant increase of $30 to $40 compared to previous prices.

### Hardware: New Angle Iron Sales are Not Strong

Due to high prices, business in hardware is unusually quiet. Sales of new angle iron yesterday were limited to the local market, with no purchases from other locations. However, prices continue to rise and show no signs of falling. Prices rose again by $2 to $3 yesterday. One-inch iron is selling for $29, two-inch iron for $17, and two-and-a-half-inch iron for $26. The asking price for three-inch iron is between $26 and $25.75 (unit: per market picul). Only 200 to 300 piculs were sold.

### Silk and Tea: New York's July Statistics Show Decline in Raw Silk Consumption; Prospects for Chinese Silk Sales to the US

According to Reuters, New York's raw silk situation in July shows that actual sales have generally been declining in recent months. Although the abolition of the US-Japan trade agreement will not take effect until next spring, US merchants' interest in purchasing Japanese silk seems to have gradually waned over the past ten months. New York's raw silk imports in July amounted to 32,681 bales, an increase of more than 10,000 bales compared to the previous month, but sales amounted to only 26,142 bales. Although this figure is only a decrease of 114 bales compared to the previous month, it is worth noting that since January of this year, the total monthly silk sales in the United States have been gradually declining from 41,599 bales to more than one-third. From this perspective, prospects for Chinese silk sales to the US seem to be improving. The attached statistics on US raw silk in July are provided for reference (unit: bales).

Fifteen shipments of raw silk were transported to Hong Kong on the 5th.

### Statistics: The Rising Cost of Living; Food and Housing Prices Increase Without End

The housing problem in this city is becoming increasingly serious. The second survey of rents this year was conducted in July. The rent index for this month was 282.41, an increase of 4.67% compared to the index from January to June of this year, and an increase of 9.37% compared to the index from June to December of last year. Rent increases varied for different types of housing. Rents for Western-style houses increased by 6.91%, shikumen houses by 6.69%, and bungalow rents increased the least, by 0.90%. Among the houses surveyed this month, 29.31% experienced rent increases, of which 17.24% were due to increased water charges, 6.90% were due to new tenants being charged higher rents after old tenants moved out, and 5.17% were due to discretionary rent increases. Since the outbreak of the war, rents for all types of housing in this city have been repeatedly increased. To protect the interests of tenants, the court has rejected rent increases exceeding 20% or repeated rent increases within a short period of time. As a result, many landlords have used the excuse of increased tenants and soaring water charges to increase water charges, and the amount increased often far exceeds the actual water consumption. This type of increase in water charges is actually a disguised form of rent increase.

After a sharp rise in rice prices in June, prices gradually declined at the beginning of this month, largely due to hot weather and distress selling by hoarders. On July 17th, after consultation between the Standing Bureaus of the two concessions and the Rice Merchants Association, a notice was issued again to suppress price limits. The maximum selling price for high-quality japonica rice was not allowed to exceed $20 per picul, and for guest indica rice, it was not allowed to exceed $16. As soon as the price limits were set, the exchange rate changed dramatically, and merchants hoarded goods and refused to sell, causing prices to rise. However, the authorities, prioritizing the people's food supply, insisted on maintaining the price limits. As a result, the market saw cases of selling goods at high prices against the rules, and high-quality goods almost disappeared. Later, the chaos intensified, and the market became nominal. Under-the-table transactions often exceeded the price limits, but they were mostly private transactions without formal receipts to avoid violating the price limits. By the end of the month, the authorities of the two concessions jointly investigated rice warehouses, and speculators eager to sell off their holdings, causing market prices to rebound slightly.

Retail prices generally trended upwards. Among food items, meat and vegetables saw the most significant increases. Salted meat rose by 59.78% compared to the previous month, fresh meat by 11.52%, green vegetables by 41.82%, radishes by 27.27%, and chives by 25.76%. Other fresh fish, duck eggs, white sugar, etc., also experienced strong price increases. Due to the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates, the price of coal briquettes rose, reaching as high as $2.60 to $2.80 per picul, with an average price of $2.08 for the whole month, an increase of 14.64% compared to the previous month. The index for this month, the previous month, and the same month last year are listed below for comparison (prices in 1936 are used as the base).

Clothing, Food, Housing and Transportation

### Air-Conditioned Environment

— Lu Lishi

In hot weather, wealthy people must ensure their homes have a suitable temperature. Of course, the most comfortable cool house is one equipped with air conditioning.

Air conditioning is manufactured using mechanical power. The transformation of "energy" in matter is not complicated in scientific principle. Nitrogen (a type of ammonia) is liquefied using high pressure, and then the pressure is reduced to return it to a gaseous state. This requires the supply of a large amount of heat, which is absorbed from every gap in the room. Therefore, the temperature in this room gradually drops. People who have been walking around in air above 90 degrees feel very cool when they enter a place with air conditioning. However, this type of air conditioning equipment costs a lot of money, so only a few large companies and entertainment venues in the city have this luxurious amenity.

Some people consider themselves to be physically weak, and are therefore afraid of air conditioning. They are often hesitant to enter air-conditioned rooms. This fear is unwarranted. If you enter an air-conditioned environment too quickly after sweating profusely, a weak person may not be able to resist the stimulus and may easily suffer from illnesses such as suppressed sweating or catching a cold. However, strong people are not affected at all. If you have not been sweating profusely, it is fine to work or be entertained in an air-conditioned environment without harming your physical or mental health. In general, a person's body needs to be trained to resist cold and heat. For example, people who are accustomed to taking cold showers will not get sick from the cold. Many elderly politicians in London and Washington work in air-conditioned environments all day long and do not completely lose their lives. However, it must be stated here that a truly luxurious air-conditioned environment is well-suited for people wearing suits. If necessary, just put on a "jacket"!

### Talking About Summer Clothes in Summer

— Shen Xishen

As soon as the weather gets hot, all cotton clothes and lined clothes make people feel disgusted, and all kinds of light shirts and cool clothes are now in season. The original summer fabrics of our country, such as pongee, cloud gauze, and summer cloth, are all exquisite and cool. Those who want to make summer clothes can find them among these fabrics, so why rely on imported goods and spend foreign exchange!

Pongee: Pongee is clean, white, soft, and the best of summer fabrics. "Real gold is not afraid of fire." Although artificial silk summer fabrics are being sold on the market in large quantities, pongee still maintains its highest position. When it comes to summer fabrics, nothing else compares! Whether making long clothes, short clothes, men's robes, or women's robes, Chinese or Western style, pongee is suitable for everything. The producing areas of pongee are in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, but Hangzhou's Hangzhou pongee and Shengze's Sheng pongee are the most famous.

Cloud Gauze: Cloud gauze is also called kao silk and is a specialty of Guangdong. The texture is extremely strong. A garment can often be worn for six or seven years before it tears. The selling price is not too high, and washing is very convenient, so it is most popular among the general public! It is also light, cool, and breathable. Wearing it in summer is very cool and comfortable. In recent years, it is common to see women using it to make cheongsams. Wearing it is not only beautiful, but also restores rights and interests (you can wear one less cheongsam made of imported raw materials). This is very worthwhile to promote.

Summer Cloth: Xia cloth from Wanzai, Jiangxi, is famous far and wide. There are coarse and fine varieties. Wearing it is cool and light. It was originally the most common summer clothing in our country. Unfortunately, in recent years, imported summer fabrics have been dumped at low prices, and summer cloth is gradually being eliminated! Just looking at the once-popular summer cloth long gowns, which are now as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, it is clear how much the sales of summer cloth have declined! In fact, summer cloth is both strong and washable, and wearing it feels generous. Compared with imported summer fabrics, it is no less good. So why should we abandon this for that!

### National Goods Feast Worth Promoting

— Yan

Since the City Chamber of Commerce advised all industries to stop using shark fins in banquets, although few people have implemented it, it cannot be said that there have been no results. However, "if you don't eat shark fins, you change to other precious delicacies, such as bird's nest, sea cucumber, abalone, etc., then it doesn't really fit the principle of thrift, and the path to reducing leakage is even more distant; and because of the soaring prices, the prices of banquets have increased. If we don't urgently seek a way to reform, the middle and lower-paid classes will be embarrassed by the face-social customs, and when they encounter necessary celebratory banquets, they really suffer from unbearable burdens. Therefore, I believe that promoting national goods banquets to reduce the prices of banquets is currently an urgent matter.

Below, I will try to open a menu of national goods banquets for reference:

(1) Four Main Dishes: Chicken Congee with Fish Maw, Clear Stewed Whole Duck, Golden and Silver Trotters, White Juice Mandarin Fish. (2) Six Hot Dishes: Stir-Fried Shrimp Meat, Carambola with White Fungus, Braised Chicken with Mushrooms, Braised Fish Maw, Yunnan Ham, Fried Twin Tails. (3) Two Desserts: Bean Paste Buns, Chicken Wonton. (4) Others: Four Combination Platters, Four-Color Fruits, Melon Seeds for Each Guest.

The price of the above menu is 10 to 11 yuan per table in larger restaurants, and 8 to 9 yuan or around 7 yuan in smaller restaurants and kitchens, which is 4 to 6 yuan lower than "shark fin dishes" or dishes with other precious delicacies (of course, this is still calculated based on the minimum shark fin dishes). This is much easier for middle and lower-class citizens to afford.

Regarding this, we hope that the society and various industry organizations will actively expand and promote it to break the system of face-saving and reduce the suffering of citizens. At the same time, the leisured and propertied classes are also worth emulating and promoting, because the money saved from these celebrations and banquets can be donated to the refugees in greater proportions.

(Short Message) Zhou Mengxian, the general manager of the China DeSoto Automobile Company at 167 Yu Qiaqing Road, who handles Chrysler DeSoto passenger cars and trucks known for their economy and durability, traveled to Hong Kong last spring to observe the automobile industry. Due to a large number of orders from the government, he remained in Hong Kong to establish an office and factory. He only took the time to return to Shanghai last week. Mr. Zhou is well-connected and has been entertaining relatives and friends every night, it is said.

### A Week's Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Summer is the most fashionable season for melons. Fruits such as watermelon, cantaloupe, and golden melon are indeed in full swing. Whether rich or poor, everyone wants to try them. Among vegetables, winter melon, cucumber, and loofah are holding the fort, and they occupy an important position as well. Winter melon and cucumber can be used in both meat and vegetarian dishes. Loofah is a mainstay in vegetarian dishes and is never used in meat dishes. Winter melon can be cooked in many ways. Ham winter melon soup is both fresh and clear, and it is the best soup dish to eat with rice. For white-stewed pork knuckle, which is usually cooked with radish, winter melon can now be used as a substitute. Further on, white-stewed chicken, white-stewed duck, etc., also need the cooperation of winter melon. As for vegetarian cooking methods, such as braised vegetarian winter melon and winter melon braised with tofu, they are also very delicious. Cucumber stir-fried with seasonal shrimp is the most common meat dish, but unfortunately, shrimp prices are too expensive, and we cannot eat it often. Other dishes, such as bean starch sheets mixed with cucumber and pickled cucumber, are also simple and flavorful. Loofah stir-fried with Wuxi gluten is naturally rich and delicious, and the red-braised vegetarian ten-scene dish cannot do without it.

Monday: Winter Melon Ham Soup, Braised Small White Fish, Cucumber Mixed with Bean Starch Sheets, Stir-Fried Green Vegetables with Bean Vermicelli.

Tuesday: Onion Beef Shreds, Sweet and Sour Yellow Croaker Slices, Stir-Fried Red Amaranth, Stewed Fermented Bean Curd.

Wednesday: Chives Stir-Fried with Pork Shreds, Cucumber Stir-Fried with Seasonal Shrimp, Red Braised Vegetarian Ten-Scene Dish, Chinese Toon Mixed with Tofu.

Thursday: Dried Vegetables Braised with Pork, Sweet and Sour Squid, Loofah and Bean Vermicelli Stir-Fried with Gluten, Vegetable Soybean Sprouts.

Friday: Curry Beef Slices, Pickled Mustard Greens Egg Drop Soup, Beijing Winter Vegetable Bean Starch Sheets, Braised Cabbage.

Saturday: Winter Melon White-Stewed Meat, Dry-Braised Ribbon Fish, Dried Tofu Shreds, Tea Soybean Sprouts, Stir-Fried Cabbage with Bean Curd Sheets.

Sunday: Minced Meat Fried with Sauce, Fish Soup, Braised Eggplant, Stir-Fried Celery.

### Using Science to Improve Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Yang Chunlv

Humans appeared on Earth 200,000 years ago. However, at that time, humans were covered in hair, had no clothes to wear, ate only animal meat and plant fruits, and lived in caves or forests, almost like animals. It was not until the last 5,000 years that humans conquered various beasts and gradually progressed.

It was not easy for humans to conquer beasts. We do not have the strong legs of a deer to run, nor the sharp claws of a tiger to defend ourselves, nor the hard armor to cover our entire body, nor the venom to kill enemies; yet humans finally triumphed. What did we rely on?

The biggest reason why humans were able to conquer beasts is that humans have brains to think and hands to do things that various animals cannot do. Humans relied on this innate power to use science to reduce their labor and improve their lives. After more than 3,000 years of research and improvement, our lives have reached their current state. Without science, how could we have reached this point? Therefore, science is the guiding light of human life, and a great history of science is the history of human life. Now, I will discuss the four aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation separately:

(1) Clothing: Raising silkworms to obtain silk is a method that has been popular in our country since ancient times. However, this rudimentary method is very troublesome. First, planting mulberry trees takes a lot of human effort. Then, feeding silkworms with mulberry leaves until they can spin silk and make cocoons also requires a lot of effort. Humans have used this troublesome method to obtain silk for almost 2,000 years. Scientists are people who do improvement work, and they certainly cannot easily ignore this matter, which has a significant relationship with human life. Therefore, since 1855, scientists have come up with simple methods to turn plant fibers into things like silk without the need to plant mulberry trees and raise silkworms. Around 1892, the rayon currently in use was invented. Silk turns yellow when it comes into contact with sweat, but rayon does not. Silk's reflectivity to light is not as good as rayon's, and rayon's strength and thickness can be made according to human will, which silk can never do. Therefore, the production and sales of rayon worldwide exceed those of silk.

(2) Food: Human dietary habits have a history of thousands of years. In the past, vegetarians did not want to eat meat, and meat-eaters were not accustomed to vegetarian food. Scientists have made a lot of effort to reconcile these two habits. The difference between vegetarian and meat food is only the different sources of fat. If it is possible to find a way to turn vegetable oil into animal oil, such "artificial fat" could be eaten by both vegetarians and meat-eaters. After research by many scientists, this ideal has finally been realized, so since 1900, artificial fat has gradually been sold on the market.

(3) Housing: Because people want to obtain comfort and happiness, human residences and utensils have gradually been invented. Since the number of humans on Earth is increasing year by year, to prevent panic in living spaces, it is necessary to change from occupying ground to occupying space. With the invention of steel and concrete construction methods, it is not difficult to build multi-story buildings. The 70-story buildings in New York City in the United States are undoubtedly very impressive. Scientists have put a lot of effort into creating utensils: using hot water fins to keep out the cold, using cold water fins to keep out the heat, using electric current to pass through metal wires to emit light, making electric lamps, so that when it gets dark at night, the light shines, almost like the sun.

(4) Transportation: The power that nature gives to humans is very weak. We cannot carry heavy things or walk long distances. Without fins, we cannot swim in the water. Without wings, we cannot fly in the air. People with superior brains and hands often want to break through these difficulties. After research by countless people and long-term improvement, using water power and wind power to work for humans has gradually become a reality. By the 11th century, scientists found steam and electricity that were greater than water power and wind power. It became very easy to transport heavy things to fast places. Swimming in the water or flying in the air has also become a reality. Bushnell made a submarine that can travel in the water, and the Wright brothers invented the airplane, allowing people to move freely in the water and in the air.

The above are some of the most significant facts about how science has improved human life. Since science, humans have gradually shed their barbaric lives. Various inventions that save labor and save time have gradually led humans to the road of culture, and we have obtained more peaceful and happy lives. Therefore, using science can create our new life.

Spring and Autumn

### Fear and Gratitude

— Yu Ling

News came from friends at the Shanghai Drama Society that the premiere of "Night Shanghai" is scheduled. Normally, as the playwright of this play, I myself would feel excited and happy. However, this time, replacing the excitement and happiness are fear and gratitude.

In the past, due to my love for theater, I studied playwriting, acting like a fearless newborn calf. Reality forced me to speak my mind. I did not seek playwriting skills, nor did I calculate success or failure. In the so-called playwriting drought of missing scripts, occasionally a play was staged, merely as a "filler." In the performances of "Women's Apartment" and "Tears on Flowers," although I received guidance from insightful theater critics and encouragement from enthusiastic theatergoers, every time I reflected, I felt more uneasy and dissatisfied. I almost made a private decision to never dare to act recklessly again, to bury myself in study for ten years, and then meet with those who love and expect from me.

Two and a half months ago, my lively and healthy eighteen-month-old child, unfortunately due to negligence in care, fell ill for two months and eventually died, without leaving a single photo, without even leaving a name. Outside the window, the moonlight was white, and the intermittent sounds came:

The crescent moon shines on the nine provinces,
Some families rejoice, some families grieve!
Some couples share the same embroidered bed?
Some drift and wander far away?

It sang so desolately that I couldn't sit still and rushed out the door. I saw F originally wanting to comfort me, but the scene turned into "speechless," bathed in the moonlight in a daze. Silence, instead, aroused her homesickness. So, from the scene of "raising my head to look at the bright moon, lowering my head to think of my hometown," she finally recited:

Years have passed since I visited Hejiang Garden,
Talking about the past breaks my heart!
Only the plum blossoms know this hatred,
Meeting under the moon, yet speechless.

Under this bright moon, she was again depressed and sad, as if weeping and complaining, stirring up my old and new hatreds. From this point, the encounter of the Mei family in "Night Shanghai" was conceived.

Suddenly taking up the pen, I impulsively forgot the failures of the past and rushed to finish a five-act play as messy as a pile of grass.

Thanks to the friends at the Shanghai Drama Society for not giving up and arranging for it to be the first play for the opening of the Xuan Palace Theater and the long-term performance of the Drama Society. For me, it is such a fearful and humbling thing! I am fearful that the Drama Society is taking a risk, and I have dared to act recklessly again.

I am grateful to Mr. Li Jianwu, Gu Zhongyi, Wu Renzhi, and Chen Ximu for giving me many valuable opinions. I am even more grateful to Mr. Zhu Duanjun, who calmly responded to the challenge. Not only was he willing to direct this script, which was rushed and had minor flaws, but he also carefully read each act after it was written, giving me many insightful and thoughtful instructions. Limited by censorship and performance time, Mr. Zhu painstakingly cut out some scenes and refined the essence during the directing process, making "Night Shanghai" more complete. I have always maintained that under the direction of a skilled director, the playwright only provides some materials for the play. A script is not much more valuable than a piece of triangular wood used to make scenery. In the performance of "Night Shanghai," I only contributed a piece of wood. If there is anything worth seeing, it is all thanks to Mr. Zhu's direction and the acting skills of the actors.

"Night Shanghai" bathed in the new Xuan Palace, premiered. In addition to fear, I sincerely thank you!

### Does the Soul Really Exist?

— Zhu

Regarding the question of whether the soul exists, many people have not yet resolved it. Some people say: Life in this world is about eating, drinking, and seeking pleasure. When you die, it's over. Why bother studying the soul? Others say: What you can see is real, what you can't see is fake. The soul is not seen anywhere. Still others say: When a person dies, it's like a lamp going out, returning to nothingness. What soul or no soul. Some also say: A person has three souls and six spirits. After death, one soul stays in the ancestral hall, one soul is in the grave, and one soul goes to be reincarnated. Even more people say: The three souls and six spirits are just scattered souls and lost spirits. When a person dies, the soul scatters and the spirit falls. These are the general people's views on the soul. Everyone, please think for yourselves, does the soul really exist? Do not parrot others, because this is very important! It concerns the eternal life of you and me. We must always think, go through deep consideration, what is reasonable is right, what is unreasonable is wrong, and we must not have preconceived notions. Now we will explain according to the truth, does the soul really exist? Spirit and soul are different! Limiting ourselves to just talking about the soul, I can also say that it is life. Minerals are called fixed substances, they have no life. Plants are said to have a kind of life, we can say that they grow, so plants can bloom and bear fruit, passing on seeds and generations, continuously. Animals are one level higher than plants. In addition to the soul of growth, they also have a soul of perception, so animals can feel pain, heat, hunger, and thirst, and also slightly know the relationships of closeness, love, and hate, etc. People are one level higher than animals. In addition to having the soul of growth and the soul of perception, they also have a precious soul. So people can not only grow and perceive, but also think about all kinds of things in the past and the future! Now I will describe the various reasons why people have souls below; (to be continued) Shanghai Christian Literature Evangelism Society, P.O. Box 1227

### Introducing Novel Technical Attempts

— Wu Renzhi

After the victory of the War of Resistance, Chinese drama must have a change. But the initial results will not be pure. Because the system is not established, it will inevitably be mixed. So those who are more conservative may criticize the entire form because they see the dregs in the middle. Those who are more progressive may blindly pursue novelty for the sake of partial success. Or it may even cause controversy, but significant progress may start from this.

The performance of drama in the inland areas, of course, takes the effectiveness of propaganda as the first priority, so it often tries to accommodate the audience as much as possible. The innovation of the performance style is actually also a way to cater to the audience's psychology. From the news sent by friends in the inland areas, we can know that their performance methods are changing with each passing day. It is a pity that they are working hard for the motherland and for the anti-aggression propaganda every day. There is not a moment to study the artistic position of various methods, and how to use them artistically. They are like pioneers in land reclamation. They don't have time to do geological analysis or planting research because there is still a lot of hard land reclamation work waiting for them. But not doing research is a defect, a regret. To make up for this defect and regret, it seems that only we who are left on the isolated island can do it. But this is ultimately a matter of trial and error, who will do it?

I remember that long before the War of Resistance, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian came back from his inspection in the Soviet Union and used two methods of the performance school in directing "Sunrise": one was a half-cut, top-through device, and the other was a mirror without a mirror surface. The former increased the realism of piling and building houses, and the latter completed close-up shots. At that time, it did attract people's attention, but later there was never any new continuation on the formal stage.

Now, we have to thank Mr. Yu Ling, who actually made a bold attempt in "Night Shanghai," trying two things: one is that there is no one on the bed, and the other is the use of shadow play. We should not speculate in advance about the effect. Now I want to give an introduction from a theoretical point of view:

Starting from Object Symbolism

When talking about "symbolism" in theatrical performances, we always think of Peking Opera, because Peking Opera is full of symbolic performances. For example, a horse whip, from the groom leading it to the rider getting on the horse, is completely treated as a horse. After getting on the horse, pointing it behind the back and waving it a few times, it is already being treated as a whip. After a few flourishes, the whip may become a short stick pointing here and there during the singing and recitation. Yes, this is called the performance of object symbolism. However, if you look at it from this perspective and want to understand the performance of symbolism, then it is really "climbing a tree to catch a fish." Using a whip for three purposes is only the surface of the symbolic performance. It has its own valuable artistic performance in other aspects.

Let's take an example: There is a scene in "Walking Maicheng" that is dedicated to depicting the situation of the mount being lost and unable to move forward. At that time, every posture can make you praise it. I believe that if it were really on horseback, there would be no such performance. Another example is Hua Shanshan going downstairs, and suddenly falling down halfway. Showing how delicate she is. You say, if it were really on the escalator, wouldn't it look so clumsy? This is to say that symbolic acting can have beauty that exceeds what realism depicts.

Furthermore, for example, in the "Sitting in the Palace" scene of "Stealing the Order," the child in the princess's hand can only be fake. But, even if it were possible, it is actually better not to hold a real one. Because the subject of that scene is the princess. For the sake of the child, it will take away the main component of the princess. Moreover, think about it, if the princess is holding a real child, how clumsy will the princess's posture be? This is to say that symbolic performances can sometimes especially strengthen the subject.

Now, in "Night Shanghai," Yun Gu's mother was originally sick in bed until she died, but now there is no one on the bed from beginning to end. This is the use of symbolic performance techniques: strengthening Yun Gu's main performance and giving Yun Gu the opportunity to perform the beauty of transcendence in description.

Starting from Intentional Symbolism

In terms of stage performance, if the scene being symbolized is outside the visible scene, we call it intentional symbolism. The use of shadow play is actually the use of the performance method of intentional symbolism.

I heard from friends that shadow play is used a lot in the inland areas, and because the lines are hard, it has a good effect. However, this is the first time that it has been formally adopted from an artistic point of view. In fact, this technique is often used in movies. When the plot develops to a certain point, it will come with a series of quick sketch shots. The current shadow play is equivalent to this type of shot.

Generally, people think that realism and symbolism are two completely irreconcilable methods, especially object symbolism. This experiment can solve part of this problem. In addition to introducing two new technical attempts, I would like to draw attention to one point in particular.

### I Fear Wu Ji

— Lan Lan

Under many oppressions and many scruples, the theater circle on the isolated island is feeling a script panic. We have seen Mr. Yu Ling's new work "Night Shanghai." How can it not make people excited?

I am honored to have played Pei Pei in "Women's Apartment" and Mi Mi in "Tears on Flowers," and now I am going to play Wu Ji in "Night Shanghai." It so happens that in the same period, I am filming "Women's Apartment," directing "Tears on Flowers," and performing "Night Shanghai." Among these three scripts, the role of Pei Pei is more annoying. She only knows how to compete for jealousy and intrigue all day long, planning how to win a better and more comfortable life to be a more outstanding parasite. Such a woman is too insulting to many outstanding women! Mi Mi is more pitiful. She wants to struggle, wants to go upwards. She is not guilty herself, but the road that society shows her is an abyss. Under the abuse of her stepmother, the oppression of society, and the seduction of men, she ends up taking the road of suicide. As for Wu Ji in "Night Shanghai," I think she is lovely and worthy of sympathy. The author has carved her so deeply and so prominently. She is not a special person. Among the four thousand or so dance girls in Shanghai, she is also one of them. Her life is like the one surrounding us, and it is also a typical example of the urban women's lives that we are familiar with. We can hear it, see it, and imagine it. Her life experience exceeds that of the four dance girls in "Tears on Flowers." She has encountered abuse, suffered bullying, and life may have forced her to commit suicide, to be dissolute, to be promiscuous, to be deceived; all the unfortunate dance girls have tried, and the tragic stories all appear in her life attitude in the play. The tragic experience has numbed her whole person. She only uses "dance" as her livelihood. In order to live, she advises Yun Gu—this lonely and helpless little girl—to become a prostitute for the sake of her mother's illness and to prevent her siblings from being driven out to sleep on the streets. She also teaches Feng Feng—this outstanding student of fine arts—to dance. Yes, she is doing this on purpose.

Dear audience, I don't want to deceive you. When I was rehearsing this role, under the detailed analysis and instructions of director Zhu Duanjun, I feared Wu Ji. I feared her so much that I felt cold. I wanted to shout silently, I wanted to cry without tears. I was dazed and silly. There was always a large and heavy object lying in my chest. This kind of "inner" role, this life in the superficial layer is too tragic.

Dear audience, I also want to tell you that our group, a group who loves theater, has decided on this long-term performance in order to unite more strongly and work more intensely. Our first meeting gift must not be bad, yes, we must not let it fail. Because in the past there were audiences who cared about us and friends who encouraged us, so we rely on this reliable strength, as the director said, we will study, think, work hard, and rehearse without sleep or food. But we also want to ask for more. Dear audience, dear friends, give us more and more serious love and criticism, let us join hands and spur on and alert the playwright and director's hard work, so that the stage can shine and drive away the darkness of society.
