Editorial

### Shanghai Rice Market After the Crackdown

The general social atmosphere within the Shanghai concessions has clearly become more stable in recent days. The joint announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council on the 10th of this month to crack down on unscrupulous merchants disrupting the rice market demonstrates the authority and determination of the authorities governing the concessions, providing a positive influence on rice prices directly, and a stern warning to those disrupting other industries indirectly. It has also allowed the general population to restore normal beliefs and correct abnormal psychological states. Therefore, the goal of the announcement was to curb the continued rise in rice prices, but the actual effect has been to lower rice prices and cause people to expect further declines. The way of governance is extremely subtle, and success or failure is not accidental.

This newspaper has repeatedly discussed the rice issue. Now, while delighted to see the authorities' determination and the decline in market prices, I still feel compelled to say one more thing: First, there have been several incidents of rice looting in the past two days, after the authorities' announcement. Some believe that the high price of rice has led to serious consequences that cannot be remedied by the authorities' determination to crack down, while others believe that the announcement does not provide protection, encouraging the desperate. These two views are based on a lack of understanding and are not fair. According to industry insiders, if the authorities had not taken this decisive action, rice prices would have already exceeded the 50-yuan mark yesterday and today. It can be seen that the decline in prices after the crackdown, on the surface, has curbed the continued rise and has achieved further results, and in reality, it has achieved even greater results compared to a sharp increase. The effect is clear and has already provided much relief. As for the serious consequences, although the turmoil and sharp price increases are serious issues, the causes are not limited to one aspect. One cannot expect that taking a single action to crack down on rice alone can achieve all the desired effects. The announcement's statement of not providing protection refers to those who disregard the announcement and persist in their evil ways. How can one take it out of context and falsely claim it as an implication to loot rice? Rice looters are either ignorant people whose actions are excusable, or they are ruffians whose crimes are unforgivable. It is up to the law enforcers to consider the circumstances and make a judgment. In any case, how can the announcement of not providing protection be used as a talisman? If someone criticizes the statement of not providing protection as a pretext to oppose the crackdown and attack the authorities, then this is a malicious misinterpretation deliberately made by unscrupulous merchants, a conspiracy to commit evil, and should be condemned ruthlessly by everyone.

Second, industry insiders have said that some rice shops closed early yesterday in light of the rice looting; others have said that some rice merchants were afraid of rice trucks being conspicuous in the market, or were worried about accidents, or were worried about violating the ban on hoarding, or were afraid of revealing their hoarding for profit, so they dared not release their goods; still others have said that some rice ships arrived at port, but because rice merchants were wary, and observing, no one made inquiries. The reporter has no way to confirm these events, but they are all very possible phenomena. Is this not the effect of shame and social sanctions, or is it excessive and an extreme case of worrying about gains and losses? This is nothing more than that those who failed to regulate themselves by common sense in the past have lost their self-confidence in their common sense. Otherwise, the rice business is a legitimate business, and pursuing a small profit of one-tenth of a percent, why should one be ashamed? In the past, those who were cautious and diligent in the industry followed the trend, and with the rising tide, enjoyed extremely high profits, and never advocated self-regulation for the public welfare. Those who were greedy and ruthless inside and outside the industry, with a loss of conscience, took advantage of the fire to rob, almost wanting to exhaust the sustenance of their children and grandchildren and pre-spend it in their own pockets in one moment. Then, those who are now fearful and hesitant, even if one says they are pitiful and not worthy of sympathy, what is wrong with that? However, there are also those who are anxious about this and believe that closing early is no different from a social strike; not releasing goods is no different from locking up the warehouses and closing the mouths and stomachs of society; and not making inquiries, how can one expect a continuous supply of rice? If the power of unscrupulous merchants is still more formidable than the authority and determination of the concession authorities, then it cannot be definitively said that the conspiracy to take revenge and to blackmail is entirely impossible. However, reality does not allow such unbridled, reckless actions. This is because the authority of the concession authorities is sufficient not only to crack down on disturbances and prevent unscrupulous merchants from arbitrarily raising prices, but also to dispose of inventory and prevent unscrupulous merchants from arbitrarily refusing to sell. If unscrupulous merchants do not know to restrain themselves, they will only prompt the authorities to implement confiscation, which will surely be sincerely supported and strongly defended by the residents. The key lies in the authorities maintaining their strong determination. Moreover, the rice business is a legitimate business, and there is no shortage of legitimate rice merchants. As long as there is a small profit, why would one attach oneself to unscrupulous merchants and destroy one's own foundation? Not only that, but all industries are based on supply and demand. If you destroy your own industry, who cannot operate this industry? People in the industry can operate it, and people outside the industry can also operate it; Chinese people can operate it, and Japanese people can also operate it. Therefore, worrying about unscrupulous merchants escalating their disruptive tactics is unnecessary.

Third, I would like to address those rice merchants and outside hoarders who possess rice, as well as the banks and money shops that provide loans for rice. To use rice as a target for speculation and monopoly, and to become wealthy through hoarding for profit, is truly outrageous and deserving of condemnation. This is not something to be dismissed as the whining of the poor, nor is it something to be envied by others. The truth is that there are few rich people and many poor people; the rich eat less rice, and the poor eat more rice. The rich spend perhaps only one or two percent of their living expenses on rice, while the poor spend eight or nine tenths of their living expenses on rice. Therefore, the result of raising rice prices is that people in the middle and lower classes suffer the most, and they account for eighteen or nineteen out of every twenty in society. Therefore, those who operate in the rice industry must respect the unique nature of this industry, different from other industries, and must not only seek profit. Speculation and monopoly are not the right path. Even in other commodities, it would not be cursed and hated by society, but it is unacceptable to hoard rice. Silver and money lenders earn limited interest on loans, but lending to rice hoarders makes them major accomplices in creating endless evil. How can one hope that those who possess rice or rice loans and understand the great righteousness will promptly conduct self-examination, and, in addition to legitimate profits, either take the lead in selling off goods at low prices, or pressure borrowers to sell off goods, as a guide to their peers? Once the virtuous reputation is spread, one will see that unscrupulous merchants can no longer commit their evil deeds, and rice prices will fall sharply. Then, among the five million residents, more than four million will be moved to tears of gratitude. One's own sacrifice is not much, but the blessings created are immense!

### German Pocket Battleship Heavily Damaged; Will Be Detained by Uruguay for the Duration of the War; Five British Warships Outside the Port Monitor Its Inability to Escape; The German Ship Had Previously Sunk Eight British Ships

Buenos Aires, Argentina: After a battle with three British cruisers, the German pocket battleship Spee hastily fled into the port of Montevideo last night, its decks littered with dead and wounded. According to Uruguayan officials, the ship's sailors were dejected after arriving in port. According to local newspaper reports, British Cruiser Commander Harwood issued Nelson's battle cry, "England expects that every man will do his duty today," before the battle. News reporters on small steamers who inspected the Spee found the ship's body riddled with gun marks. There was a large hole in the conning tower, a hole in the bow, and one of the aircraft it carried had lost its wings and tail, with the engine strewn across the deck. Viewed from the side, the upper part of the ship looked like an irregular mass of iron. Local people believe that the German supply ship Ussukuma has recently been sunk, while another supply ship, the Takoma, dares not sail to Montevideo because the British cruiser Achilles is nearby, leaving the Spee without supplies. The ship's captain decided to seize the food from the French ship Taiwan. Although he knew that the British cruiser Wincester was not far away, he could not care. While he was about to arrest Taiwan, the British cruiser Ajax suddenly appeared, opened fire on it, and at the same time notified Achilles and Exeter to come to help. Ajax was located between the German warship and the mouth of the Plate River, trying to avoid the German warship's artillery fire, so the war was suspended for a long time in the morning. Achilles and Exeter then joined the battle. When Ajax and Achilles were further away from the German warship, Exeter sailed in to engage in battle. The three British ships jointly bombarded the Spee, which was unable to resist, and fled to the coast. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

Montevideo, Uruguay: According to reliable sources, the British heavy cruiser Cumberland, weighing 10,000 tons and armed with eight 8-inch guns, sailed to the outside of Uruguay yesterday to monitor the German pocket battleship "Admiral Spee." The British cruisers "Achilles", "Ajax" and "Exeter" are still patrolling outside the port. Yesterday, one could see the British cruiser "Achilles" slowly sailing back and forth outside the Uruguayan waters. According to an Associated Press reporter's investigation, in the two days of fighting between the German warship and the British cruisers off the South American coast, two British shells penetrated the German warship's conning tower, piercing it from the port side to the starboard side. Two sections of thick steel plate on the front right side of the ship were destroyed, and there were several small shell wounds on the port side waterline. The tail of one of the two aircraft on the ship was destroyed. The German embassy sent a document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, requesting permission to bury 36 sailors killed on the ship. (Associated Press dispatch of the 15th)

New York: Two more British cruisers have sailed to the outside of the mouth of the Plate River in Uruguay, and there are now a total of five British cruisers. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

London: The British government yesterday formally sent a note to the Uruguayan government, requesting that Uruguay force the "Admiral Spee" to leave the port of Montevideo within 24 hours, or detain the ship for the duration of the European war. It was said that the German warship entered the port of Montevideo at full speed, which proved that the ship was still seaworthy. According to international law, unless the German warship was injured to the extent that it was unseaworthy, the ship could only stay in a neutral country's port for 14 hours without being detained. (Associated Press dispatch of the 15th)

Montevideo, Uruguay: The German 10,000-ton pocket battleship Spee will probably stay here at least until Sunday. At that time, it will accept the conditions of being detained for the duration of the war, rather than risk fighting the British ships waiting outside the mouth of the Plate River. The 92 British crew members captured by the ship have all landed today. The British ships sunk by the ship include Newton Beach (4,651 tons), Africa Shell (706 tons), Trevanon (5,299 tons), Huntsman (8,196 tons), Clement (5,051 tons), Dorec Star (10,086 tons), Ashili (4,222 tons), Strelshal (3,895 tons), and Terrorist (7,983 tons).

### Uruguayan Government Allows German Warship to Dock for 48 Hours; The Ship Can Request an Extension; South American Countries Will Protest to Britain and Germany

Washington: A State Department official recently told a Havas reporter that the sea area where the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" fought two British cruisers was within the American continental security zone designated by the "Panama Declaration" (i.e., the declaration issued by the Pan-American Conference in October of this year). The State Department is now studying various intelligence reports and exchanging views with other American countries, and may jointly issue a declaration. In addition, Secretary of State Hull also told reporters that according to international law, the ship can anchor in the port of Uruguay for 48 hours, and the ship's captain can request an extension of the berthing time from the Uruguayan government for repairs. As for the safe area designated by the Panama Declaration, all the belligerent countries in Europe have been notified in the past, and none of them have submitted a reply. This area was not intended to be defended by force, but now that it has been violated, the countries concerned should exchange views and discuss how to deal with it. (Havas dispatch of the 15th)

Washington: A certain important person claimed last night that the naval battle between the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" and three British cruisers had a great impact on the countries of the Americas, because this naval battle took place in the "safe zone" mentioned in the Panama Declaration. According to well-informed sources here, the government attaches great importance to this matter and may lodge a protest with both Britain and Germany, but the government is waiting for the South American countries to take the lead. The Argentine ambassador to the United States visited Deputy Secretary of State Welles yesterday, and other Latin American representatives said yesterday that South American countries may lodge protests with both Britain and Germany. (Associated Press dispatch of the 15th)

### French Reporter Witnesses Naval Battle

Three British cruisers and the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" engaged in a naval battle at the mouth of the River Plate. The head of the Havas News Agency's Uruguay branch, Mr. Le Grelle, witnessed the event while aboard the French steamer "Taiwan." In a telegram, he stated that the "Taiwan" left Le Havre, France on November 11th, initially escorted by French warships before sailing alone. Every night, the lights were extinguished. Yesterday morning, while sailing on the high seas, they intercepted a wireless message from the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee," notifying the British cruiser "Ajax" that it had sunk a British freighter and requesting assistance in rescuing the crew. Several minutes later, they received a wireless message from a neutral ship, revealing the location of the "Admiral Graf Spee," only fifty kilometers from the "Taiwan." The captain immediately increased speed, steering towards the Uruguayan coast to avoid it, keeping this information secret from the passengers to prevent panic. At one o'clock in the afternoon, they learned that the German ship was also heading towards the Uruguayan capital. At six o'clock, they saw the German ship firing upon another vessel, the name of which was unclear. Simultaneously, the German ship reduced speed, seemingly to monitor the "Taiwan." This lasted for about an hour. Unaware that it was a German warship, they paid little attention. Suddenly, a British cruiser appeared, speeding towards them unnoticed by the German ship. When it came within twenty kilometers of the German ship, it opened fire. The sound was deafening and exceptionally clear on board. The first shot missed, but the second hit the German ship's hull. The British ship immediately released a smokescreen for protection and gave chase at full speed. The German ship returned fire with four shots, none of which hit the British ship. By half-past eight, with dusk deepening, the German ship continued firing randomly. The British ship pursued in the darkness. This morning, the "Taiwan" arrived in the Uruguayan capital, where the German ship was anchored nearby. Crowds gathered on the shore, vying to see the damage inflicted on the ship by the British vessel. (Havas, 14th)

### Germany Plans to Build Two Battleships, Each of 35,000 Tons

The Reuters news agency in The Hague reports from Berlin that Hitler has ordered naval experts to expedite the completion of the 35,000-ton battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz, construction of which began earlier this year. Although the National Socialist Party claims the Graf Spee's engagement was a great victory for Germany, naval circles in Berlin recognize that the pocket battleship has no hope of operating effectively under the British naval blockade. Therefore, Hitler hopes to bring the Bismarck and Tirpitz into service in record time. (Reuters, 14th)

Naval sources in London, discussing the naval battle between three British cruisers and a German pocket battleship, stated that the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" is equipped with two 11-inch guns and is one of Germany's newest warships, possessing considerable firepower superior to that of the British cruisers "Exeter," "Ajax," and "Achilles." Furthermore, the weight of the shells fired by the German ship is three times that of the "Exeter" and seven times that of the "Ajax" and "Achilles." The fact that the ship still escaped into the River Plate in Uruguay demonstrates that the British cruisers were commanded by brave and skillful officers, capable of defeating a strong enemy. Naval experts have noted that the design of German pocket battleships often sacrifices armor thickness to accommodate powerful weaponry, thereby enhancing their offensive capabilities. This trade-off has been clearly demonstrated in this naval battle. (Havas, 14th)

Newspapers in New York refer to the engagement between the German pocket battleship Graf Spee and the British cruisers as the first major naval battle of the European war, generally hailing it as a British victory. A telegram from the Uruguayan capital reports that the Graf Spee's captain has requested the German minister to Uruguay to negotiate with the Uruguayan government for the internment of the ship until the end of the war, as the ship cannot complete the necessary repairs within the permitted time in port. Even if repaired, the ship would not be able to sail out again without being intercepted by British warships. (Reuters, 14th)

In London, Labour Party leader Clement Attlee praised the three British cruisers that engaged the German pocket battleship Graf Spee in the House of Commons last night. (Reuters, 15th)

Santiago, Chile: The German freighter "Dusseldorf," which sought refuge in Valparaiso, Chile, weeks ago, suddenly set sail this morning. Its destination is unknown. (Havas, 14th)

London: According to official reports from Cape Town, South Africa, when the German freighter "Lahnrecht" was intercepted by a British warship off the South African coast yesterday, the ship's crew scuttled the ship. (Havas, 15th)

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons that when a British submarine encountered the German mail steamer "Bremen" the other day, although it was within the submarine's torpedo range, the submarine, adhering to the laws of naval warfare, gave a warning, allowing it to escape. The only possible way for the submarine to intercept the "Bremen" at that time would have been to sink it with a torpedo. However, we are currently criticizing the enemy for precisely such methods and cannot imitate them. (Havas, 14th)

### German Ship Transfers Captives to the British

London: After the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" sought refuge in Montevideo, Uruguay, it transferred all the British prisoners on board—six shipmasters, nine engineers, twenty-five officers, and twenty-one sailors from the British ships it had sunk—to the local British consul. (Havas, 15th)

### Fierce Air Battle Over the North Sea; Germans Claim Eight British Planes Shot Down; British Planes Fly Over Germany to Reconnoiter Fortresses

Berlin: News received here last night states that British bombers and German fighter planes engaged in an aerial battle yesterday afternoon over the North Sea between Wangerooge and Spiekeroog. Twelve British bombers, equipped with the latest military aircraft, were intercepted by German planes, which shot down six British aircraft. The rest immediately fled. One German plane was damaged and forced to land at sea. (Haitong, 15th)

Berlin: The German High Command announced that, according to follow-up reports, the air forces of Britain and Germany engaged in aerial combat over Wangerooge and Spiekeroog, resulting in the downing of eight British aircraft. (Haitong, 15th)

London: Responsible sources here stated that several British aircraft actively searched a large area of the North Sea yesterday for German warships and submarines for two and a half hours. They discovered several warships in the distance, but upon approaching, realized they were a German pocket battleship, a cruiser, several destroyers, and a submarine, sailing south in formation. The German submarine fired first upon seeing our planes, then submerged. At that time, several fighters on board the enemy ships took off to engage. The ships also fired anti-aircraft guns at our planes. After the shelling stopped, enemy planes returned to engage, six times in total, lasting for half an hour. For the first fifteen minutes, neither side gained an advantage. Then, a Messerschmitt twin-engine fighter caught fire and crashed into the sea. Several minutes later, three more crashed into the sea. One of our planes was also shot down, and two went missing. In addition, a group of British planes made a reconnaissance flight over northwestern Germany, flying very low to photograph the German coastal fortifications, often crossing Heligoland at less than one hundred feet above ground. The German anti-aircraft guns were caught by surprise and unprepared. By the time they opened fire, our planes had completed their mission and flown into the clouds. Although enemy fighters took off to intercept, they were unable to engage effectively. All of our reconnaissance planes returned to base at dusk. (Havas, 15th)

### Soviet Troops Capture Several Locations in Northern Finland; Finnish Army Retreats, Adopting Scorched Earth Policy

Helsinki: According to information gathered here, Soviet troops have occupied the towns of Salmijärvi and Kolosjoki in the nickel mining region of northern Finland and advanced to North Petsamo, near the Norwegian border, by evening. Before retreating to new positions, Finnish troops burned down the villages, so the Soviet troops gained only scorched earth. According to military sources, when Soviet troops attacked Salmijärvi, they were supported by air power from Petsamo Bay, and a large number of tanks cleared the snow. However, Finnish troops attacked the flanks of the Soviet advance units with machine guns, which were not deterred by the light tanks. The Soviet troops advanced quickly, seemingly well-equipped. Salmijärvi caught fire last night and was still burning this morning. Kolosjoki, Tuuleva, and other places have also been burned down by Finnish troops. Kemihaara fell this morning. (Haitong, 15th)

Kirkenes, Norway: Soviet Red Army soldiers entered Salmijärvi at 4:50 PM yesterday. Fires broke out throughout the area. As Finnish troops retreated, they set fire to locations within the city and the three villages of Tuuleva, Korablevda, and Boris Gleb. Flames can also be seen within the territory of Ravijärvi. The northern front is relatively quiet. The Soviet offensive used lightly armed units and all-terrain vehicles and tanks to encircle Finnish troops in the snow, resulting in a major victory. According to neutral reports, Finnish troops recaptured Salla this morning after two days of bitter fighting, with thousands of Soviet casualties. (United Press, 15th)

### League of Nations Discusses Aid to Finland After Expelling Soviet Union; Will Send Representatives to Various Countries for Coordination; China and Egypt Elected Non-Permanent Council Members

Geneva: The League of Nations Assembly and Council yesterday passed resolutions declaring the Soviet Union's expulsion from the League. League Secretary-General Avenol notified the Soviet government this morning, stating that the country is no longer a member of the League. Regarding the provision in the Assembly resolution for providing material and humanitarian aid to Finland, the League's technical bodies will discuss the necessary measures with the utmost care to coordinate the assistance that member states can provide to Finland. Representatives will be dispatched to various national capitals within a short period to undertake coordination work. In addition, League Deputy Secretary-General Sakolin, a Soviet national, has announced that he will terminate his cooperation with the League. (Havas, 15th)

Geneva: The League Council held a meeting at 5:00 PM this afternoon and immediately passed a resolution declaring the Soviet Union's expulsion.

(Havas, 14th)

Geneva: The League Assembly elected China and Egypt as non-permanent members of the League Council yesterday afternoon. The two seats were up for re-election after China and Latvia completed their terms. China was re-elected, and Egypt succeeded Latvia as a non-permanent member. (Haitong, 15th)

Geneva: The League Council held a meeting at 5:00 PM this afternoon, chaired by the Bolivian representative, Costa du Rels. He delivered a speech welcoming the Chinese representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, on China's re-election to the Council, stating that China has always cooperated with the League and that Dr. Koo has always handled difficult situations with skill and intelligence, which is admirable. He then presented the resolution declaring the Soviet Union's expulsion, which condemned the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland and stated, based on the reasons listed by the League Assembly and the provisions of Article 16, Paragraph 4 of the League Covenant, that "the Soviet Union, having excluded itself from the League, can no longer participate in it." Representatives from various countries then expressed their views. Chinese representative Wellington Koo stated that he had not received instructions from his government and therefore abstained from voting. The Council unanimously (nine votes in favor, four abstentions) passed the resolution. (Havas, 14th)

Geneva: The League Council held a closed-door meeting today. Wellington Koo summarized the situation of China's resistance to Japanese aggression, stating that the Council should continue to address the issues raised by the Chinese government. (Haitong, 14th)

Geneva: The League Assembly passed the resolution proposed by the thirteen-nation committee today (i.e., the resolution to expel the Soviet Union and provide aid to Finland). Nine countries abstained. The Netherlands voted in favor of the first part of the resolution but abstained on the second part. The Polish representative voted in favor and spoke, attacking the Soviet Union as an aggressor and declaring Poland's loyalty to the Covenant. However, the news media here criticized the Polish representative's remarks, as Poland has repeatedly opposed resolutions to uphold peace and justice, preventing Article 11 of the Covenant from being fully invoked. For example, Poland adopted this attitude when the League discussed the Chinese dispute. Now, Poland claims to be upholding peace and justice, which is ridiculous. (Haitong, 14th)

### British Labour Leader Attacks Soviet Union

London: During a meeting in the House of Commons today, Opposition Labour Leader Major Attlee spoke after Prime Minister Chamberlain, stating, "We do not know how to excuse the Soviet Union's large-scale invasion of Finland. It is good that other countries are able to provide as much assistance as possible to the Finnish nation. However, one thing I cannot refrain from saying is that the League of Nations has handled the dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union with extreme speed, which is very different from its previous slow handling of other disputes. I believe that if the British government and the governments of other member states of the League of Nations had shown the same speed during the previous acts of aggression, this war might not have occurred." Opposition Liberal Leader Sir Archibald Sinclair spoke after him, expressing agreement with Chamberlain's speech today and strongly condemning the Soviet invasion. However, he regretted that the Prime Minister did not mention the Anglo-French financial agreement. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon had made a statement on this agreement yesterday, so he did not report on it again. However, this matter is significant and should not be taken lightly. He may explain it again at the next meeting of the House of Commons. (Havas, 14th)

### The British House of Commons' Closed-Door Meetings Facilitate Free Discussion, Not Suppress Public Opinion

London: According to a special commentator, closed-door meetings in the House of Commons are actually an expansion of the principle of free discussion, rather than a restriction of it, because they are a greater source of government power and efficiency, not a suppression of public opinion. The government, in response to requests from the opposition party, understands the need for public opinion to be expressed and deeply understands that all members of Parliament are urged by a sense of responsibility and want an opportunity to freely express their views without being exploited by Germany for propaganda. The reason for maintaining secrecy is not because there is any information that is unfavorable to disclosure, but because, during this time of war, candid discussions about supplies and services related to military operations would inevitably provide information to the Germans. The public and the press fully understand the reasons why the state does not allow them to listen, namely to ensure free discussion in wartime. According to British constitutional custom, there are many precedents for this. The earliest was in 1875, and during the last World War, the House of Commons held five closed-door meetings, while the House of Lords held one. (Reuters, 15th)

### Soviet Newspapers Discuss British and French Blockades Again

The Moscow Pravda recently published an article entitled "The Great War and Small Countries," stating that "Only a few months into the Western European war, Britain and France are attempting to expand their maritime blockade against Germany to include neutral foreign countries. British and French imperialists are now planning to use the blockade as a means of expanding the war, first placing the entire economic life and trade of neutral countries under their control, and then forcing them to join the Allied side in unified action. Therefore, if these countries want to maintain neutrality, they must follow British and French command in their diplomatic and trade policies. Recently, the economic warfare waged by Britain and France has intensified, and the difficulties of neutral countries have increased after the blockade of German exports. The so-called blockade of German exports is actually tantamount to waging war on neutral small countries, and this kind of blockade and trade control is not the only way to dominate these neutral small countries. Recently, Britain has purchased raw materials in bulk to prevent them from being imported into neutral countries. On the part of neutral countries, although the ruling class does not object to joining the war in order to speculate and make profits, they cannot but consider the desire of their people to maintain peace, preserve independence, and maintain neutrality. Therefore, although the pressure from Britain and France on small countries is increasing, the result is that the trend of small countries striving for peace and opposing war is rising."

### Coal Shortage in Germany

Berlin: According to news last night, due to transportation difficulties and a shortage of trains, Berlin has experienced a severe coal shortage during these recent cold days. National Socialist officials have instructed coal merchants to be careful when selling coal, only selling to households that actually need it. (United Press, 15th)

### German Submarine Warfare Still Serious

(Paris Air Communication) A naval expert recently spoke to a Havas News Agency interviewer, comparing the severity of submarine warfare since the outbreak of this war with that of the previous European war. He admitted that despite repeated sinkings of German submarines, they still have the capacity to replenish them with new ones. However, he forcefully asserted that it would not be difficult for Britain and France to adopt new measures to deal with them. He said, "The Germans often say that the reason the unrestricted submarine warfare failed in the last European war was that it was launched too late. If submarine warfare had been started in August 1914, Germany could have defeated the Allies by 1916. After the outbreak of this war, what Hitler has devoted all his efforts to is a quick victory. Therefore, on the first day of the war, the German naval department used submarines to sink the British mail ship 'Athenia.' The German intention was clearly to inflict a fatal blow on Britain and France in the early stages of the war. They believe that the efficiency of submarine warfare remains undiminished from that of the past, and that it can achieve great success. However, they do not know that Britain and France did not consider this last time, and were therefore caught somewhat unprepared. In this war, they are well aware that Germany will definitely repeat its old tricks, so they have long been prepared for the worst. As far as is generally known, at the beginning of September, the German fleet had a total of 55 submarines, including 20 submarines of 250 tons, and 25 submarines of 500 to 750 tons. Compared to the large French submarines, whose displacement is mostly between 600 and 1,000 tons, they are far inferior. Moreover, the total tonnage of German submarines is roughly the same as in April 1916 (when there were 38 submarines). In terms of manufacturing, they are more robust, and the weapons they are equipped with are also more sophisticated, but judging from the war record, they are still insignificant. In the past three months, apart from sinking the British battleship 'Royal Oak,' they have not achieved any major accomplishments. Furthermore, the average number of ships sunk per month is not much different from that of 1916, but it is not as good as in 1917, the first year that Germany launched submarine warfare in the last European war. Not only that, but the total number of German submarines sunk in the past two months of September and October this year is the same as the total losses for the entire year of 1916. In other words, more than half of the submarines the German fleet had at the start of the war have been sunk or severely damaged by British and French warships. It can be seen that, to this day, submarine warfare has already suffered a serious blow. However, on the other hand, German shipyards are working hard to manufacture submarines, day and night without stopping. The new submarines being manufactured all have extremely long endurance, and it is expected that they will be ready for service in a few months. The quality of these submarines is superior to those we are currently dealing with, and they can operate far from the coast. Therefore, all our small patrol aircraft and torpedo boats with short endurance will be insufficient to deal with them. However, after every offensive weapon is invented, there must be a defensive method that arises along with it. This is an immutable rule. Therefore, in order to defend against Germany's new submarines, Britain and France should utilize new types of destroyers and torpedo boats, giant submarines, and giant seaplanes to counter them. In conclusion, in the last European war, Germany manufactured a total of 768 submarines from 1914 to 1918, which shows that the country's shipyards definitely have the ability to manufacture large quantities of submarines. Judging from the past, the country's current manufacturing capabilities should not be ignored. However, we dare to assert that Germany's submarine warfare will ultimately fail, because the country's economic and financial strength is weaker than that of Britain and France. Whatever that country can do, Britain and France can do twice as much." (Havas News Agency)

### British Soldiers Killed in Action: A Total of 2,200 Since the Start of the War Three Months Ago

London During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Chamberlain, in a written reply to a certain member of parliament, stated that from the start of the war at the beginning of September this year to the end of November, a total of 2,200 British officers and soldiers were killed in action. Compared with the number of deaths in the same period after the outbreak of the last European war, this represents a decrease of 10,300. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)

### German-Polish Diplomatic Conversation Records: The German Government Discloses the Contents

Swiss Borderland The German government yesterday published a White Paper, disclosing various relevant documents from previous negotiations between the German and Polish governments, including a record of a conversation between Führer Hitler and former Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck on January 5 this year. The content is extremely interesting. At that time, Hitler forcefully stated that he remained committed to the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, but that "the Free City of Danzig must sooner or later return to Germany." At the same time, he proposed that the city should become German territory politically and Polish territory economically. Regarding the Polish Corridor issue, he only stated in vague terms that it should be resolved in a "completely novel way," but refused to explain the nature of this way. Hitler also told Colonel Beck face-to-face that if the Danzig Free City and the Polish Corridor issues could be resolved according to German wishes, then the borders of Poland would be guaranteed by Germany.

### Japan Believes the Time is Not Ripe for Opening the Yangtze River; Aims to Exclude the Interests of Third Countries; The American Public is Firm in its Opposition to Japan

Tokyo A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry declared today that the issue of opening the Yangtze River had not been discussed between Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura and American Ambassador to Japan Grew. The Yangtze River is still blockaded due to military necessity, and the time is not yet ripe to open it to the ships of third countries. This statement by the Japanese spokesman was in response to inquiries made to the Foreign Ministry by foreign journalists after seeing a report in the Japanese "Kokumin Shimbun" stating that the Yangtze River might be opened in the near future. The opening of the Yangtze River was originally advocated by Kiheiji Izabuchi, a member of the Japanese House of Peers. Yesterday, the "Kokumin Shimbun" speculated on Izabuchi's proposal, believing that signs of ripeness were approaching, but at the same time attached criticisms, stating roughly that the general public in Japan are resolutely opposed to the opening of the Yangtze River and that allowing ships from various countries to freely navigate China's inland waterways would not only destroy China's administrative integrity, but would also contradict the basic principles and customs of international law. Furthermore, this extreme navigation would naturally greatly benefit third countries economically, but would cause great losses to China politically and militarily. Moreover, unconditional opening would cause all the efforts Japan has made since the Sino-Japanese War to flow eastward and all its accomplishments to be abandoned. Therefore, in order to establish a "New Order in East Asia," the inland waterways of China should never be allowed to be navigated by third countries, because once opened, the Yangtze River shipping industry will inevitably be regained by the British. (United Press dispatch of the 15th)

Washington Democratic Congressman and member of the Foreign Affairs Committee Isaacs returned here yesterday from California. He said that the people of the West Coast are firmly advocating the implementation of "punitive measures" against Japan. Isaacs predicted that the next Congress would implement a ban on the export of munitions and raw materials to Japan. He said, "I feel that Japan must withdraw its troops from China." He believes that the future Soviet-Japanese commercial negotiations are an attempt by Tokyo to put pressure on the United States, but "this will not be effective, because the United States is not concerned about Soviet-Japanese talks." Isaacs continued, "The abolition of the 1911 US-Japan commercial treaty was a 'good thing.' I advocate passing strict legislation, but if Japan can change its ways, then apart from the abolition of the commercial treaty, there is 'no need for further sanctions against Japan.'"

### The Japanese Army in Southern Shanxi is Showing Signs of Unsteadiness; The Plan to Invade the Zhongtiao Mountains Has Failed Again; Reinforcements Have Not Arrived, and the Offensive Has Been Greatly Thwarted

Xingji The entire Japanese army in southern Shanxi is showing signs of unsteadiness. The so-called reinforcements have not arrived, and the offensive in recent days has been greatly thwarted. The war situation is also gradually becoming quiet. (Dispatch of the 14th)

Luoyang The great battle in southern Shanxi has come to an end. Over a thousand remaining Japanese troops are currently rushing to build fortifications in places such as Dayugou, Shijiacun, and Zihuayita (southeast of Wenxi). The Chinese army is actively mopping up. (Dispatch of the 14th)

Xingji The war results in southern Shanxi in the past week have shown that the attempt to invade the Zhongtiao Mountains tomorrow has failed again. Because the Zhongtiao Mountains are the Chinese army's base for attacks, every battle in southern Shanxi is aimed at "sweeping" the Zhongtiao Mountains. So far, there have been ten invasions, and every battle has ended in defeat. After the Chinese army greatly defeated the Japanese army on the 6th, they divided their troops at the foot of the Zhongtiao Mountains to carry out a rapid annihilation campaign against various Japanese units. In recent days, there have been fierce battles for every stronghold on the road from Xia County eastward to Quwo. Three to four hundred Japanese troops occupying the high ground northwest of Qingshan Village east of Xia County were completely annihilated by the Chinese army. The counteroffensive against various strongholds east of Jiang County began on the morning of the 10th. The Japanese defense line at Ershili Ridge was broken through by the Chinese army. The main force of the Japanese army has been dispersed, and individual battles are currently underway. (14th)

Xingji After the collapse of the main force of the Japanese army on the line from Majiamiao to Daling, the morale of the Chinese army greatly increased.

### Supervisor Zheng Lusheng Passed Away the Day Before Yesterday

Chongqing Zheng Lusheng, a supervisor of the Control Yuan, passed away in Ipoh, Malaya, on the morning of the 14th of this month, at the age of 73. His courtesy name was Jicheng, and he was from Tong'an, Fujian. In his early years, he followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen, devoted himself to the revolution, raised huge sums of money, and assisted Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the uprising, which was followed by the overseas Chinese community in Malaya. In 1931, he served as a member of the Control Yuan, bravely taking on responsibilities and making outstanding contributions. After the fall of Nanjing, he disguised himself and traveled to Shanghai via a secret route, then went to Malaya.

### Military Tensions in Northeastern Guangdong: Japanese Attempt to Open Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Fails, Chinese Troops in Beijiang Recover Numerous Strongholds

Hong Kong Dispatch: Amidst Japanese encroachment in Guangxi, military tensions in the northeastern Guangdong provinces have also sharply increased, likely due to mutual constraint of troop strengths. The following is a record of the battle situation:

Eastern Guangdong Front: On the southern bank of the Dongjiang River, on the 17th, Japanese troops reinforced Shenzhen in Bao'an County with over a thousand soldiers. On the 18th, guided by Chinese traitors, they secretly moved out of Longgang Pinghu in two routes, launching a pincer attack on the central section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. At that time, Chinese troops stationed in Tiantangwei, Liangduhe, Pinghu, and other locations in the central section of the railway retreated to Qingxi, Tangtouxia, and Lincun. In the afternoon, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched an attack, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese. On the 19th, as dawn broke, Japanese planes arrived to assist in the battle. The Japanese troops' ferocity surged again, and they continued to assault Chinese positions, reigniting fierce fighting. The cavalry of the Chinese Independent 20th Brigade, near Tangtouxia, under artillery cover, launched a full-scale offensive, charging back and forth along the railway line amidst a hail of bullets, killing countless Japanese soldiers. In the afternoon, fighting continued in a chaotic manner. Chinese troops also concealed landmines along the railway line, killing a large number of Japanese soldiers. Chinese troops in the mountainous areas near Lincun also completely annihilated a Japanese cavalry unit of about a hundred men. According to statistics, on the 18th and 19th, five hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. Due to the bravery of Chinese officers and soldiers, there were also some sacrifices on the Chinese side. After suffering fierce attacks, although the Japanese suffered heavy casualties, their ambition remained undiminished. On the 19th, in addition to continuing to attack Chinese positions, more than ten Japanese aircraft continuously rotated, bombing Chinese troops throughout the day. Their targets were concentrated in Qingxi, Shima, and Zhangmutou, so the losses in these areas were particularly heavy. On that day, Japanese aircraft were spotted in Dongguan, Bao'an, and Huiyang, conducting reconnaissance flights. Zhenlong in Huizhou and the highways along Huizhou-Dan and Huizhou-Zhang were all ravaged, with the aim of containing Chinese troops and threatening the Chinese military and civilian spirit of resistance. In Zhangmutou, Shima, and other places, over a hundred houses were bombed and destroyed, and dozens of civilians were killed or injured. Due to transportation difficulties, it is currently difficult to ascertain the situation in other areas.

Furthermore, on the 15th, Chinese military authorities received reports that over two hundred Japanese troops stationed in Shilong Town and approximately five hundred Japanese and puppet troops from Xihu, Wangjiashan, and Shiwan retreated along the Wanlong Highway in the afternoon, joining the Makino unit of the Japanese army in Wancheng, and then disembarked at Humen to reinforce Bao'an. Knowing that they must have ulterior motives, orders were issued to hold the Chinese troops stationed around Shilong at Hengli, Xiatan, Chalan, and Baimawai to attack Shilong. On the evening of the 16th, the Chen Shi Ni regiment of Chinese troops on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway front launched an attack on the southern suburbs of Shilong, engaging in fierce fighting with Japanese troops in the Chashan, Jingshan area on both sides of the railway for four or five hours, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. The Chinese plainclothes team once rushed to Jinshui Bridge at the Wanlong Highway station, destroying Japanese fortifications. On the 17th, there were still fierce clashes around Shilong. Also, the Liu Fayu unit of the Fourth District Guerrilla Force, active in the suburbs of Wancheng, attacked Wancheng on the evening of the 15th, engaging in nighttime skirmishes with Japanese troops at Xinhai, Zhushidi, Guanyin Temple, and other locations outside the North Gate, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers.

When Japanese troops from Shenzhen launched a northern offensive on the central section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway on the morning of the 18th, approximately five hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry from Shilong, with several artillery pieces, crossed the Jinshui River and advanced along the railway, joining the puppet troops from Chashan and Nanshe to attack the Chinese positions at Hengli Tutang. The Chen regiment, Zhang regiment of the security team, Liu unit of the guerrillas, and other regular Chinese troops stationed in the area resolutely resisted. The Japanese first bombarded the Chinese positions with artillery, and then advanced infantry under cavalry cover. The Chinese troops braced themselves and calmly responded to the Japanese heavy artillery fire and aerial bombardment. The Japanese launched several assaults, but were unable to break through the Chinese defense line. In the evening, the Japanese, suffering heavy casualties, were forced to retreat to Chashan and Jingshan. The Chinese troops took advantage of the situation to pursue them. On the morning of the 19th, the Japanese, realizing that they could not succeed, fled back to Shilong in large numbers. The Chinese troops searched for remnants in Chashan, Nanshe, and other places, and established new positions to prevent the Japanese from launching another attack. In this battle, the Japanese suffered over two hundred casualties, leaving behind more than fifty corpses. The Chinese side captured a large number of spoils of war.

Japanese troops who advanced north from Shenzhen along the Sha-Shen and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railways were met with fierce resistance from the Yu brigade, Yun Chunlin, Chen Shi, Ni Dingyuan, and other units of the Chinese army on the 18th and 19th, engaging in bloody battles in Tiantangwei, Duhe, and other places. The Japanese suffered four to five hundred casualties. On the afternoon of the 19th, large Chinese forces from Xitangxia, Longgang, and other locations joined the battle and launched a counterattack against the Japanese. The Japanese were unable to resist. By nightfall, Japanese troops near Hengkang had fled back to Shawan, and Japanese troops on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway front had also crossed the Duhe River from Tiantangwei and retreated to Pinghu and Buji. The Yu brigade Yun regiment of the Chinese army took advantage of the situation to advance that night, with the vanguard once crossing Pinghu and engaging in nighttime skirmishes with over a hundred Japanese soldiers. Later, due to strategic considerations, they retreated to their original positions. On the morning of the 20th, as dawn broke, four Japanese aircraft flew in from the Dachan Sea to cover the retreat of Japanese troops in Pinghu, Shawan, and other areas to Shenzhen. The Japanese aircraft then flew reconnaissance missions along the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Sha-Shen, and Ping-Dan lines, and dropped bombs on Tangxia, Qingxi, Lincun, and Hengli, but the extent of the Chinese losses is unknown.

After capturing Nantou and Shenzhen, the Japanese have repeatedly attempted to open the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and occupy Shayuchong, Kuiyong, Yantian, and other places to cut off the Chinese Dongjiang's external transportation links. The Chinese military authorities, aware of the Japanese plot, have been continuously transferring large forces to reinforce the defense of Dong, Bao, and Hui counties over the past month. In order to strengthen the military strength of Dongbao and tighten control over the Japanese, they have telegraphed the Fourth War Zone authorities to transfer a certain large force to reinforce the defense of various places, and have reorganized the offensive and defensive positions along the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Sha-Shen, Hui-Zhang, and Ping-Long lines, with the aim of being able to attack and encircle and annihilate the Japanese, and to consolidate the defense of the southern bank of the Dongjiang.

Beijiang Front: Chinese troops in northern Guangdong have been attacking Japanese troops along the Yue-Han and Guang-Hua lines for several days. On the 17th and 18th, fierce battles took place in Xinjie and Hengtan. Chinese troops made smooth progress and recovered many strongholds near Xinjie. On the evening of the 17th, Chinese troops on the Yue-Han Railway front attacked various strongholds northwest of Xinjie. Around 8 p.m., the Wang Battalion charged to Sanhua Store. The Japanese stubbornly defended their fortifications. Then, the Chinese artillery unit occupied the mountains near the railway and launched a dense artillery barrage, destroying more than a dozen Japanese fortifications. The Japanese soldiers, without any support, were forced to rush out to fight back. The Chinese troops seized the opportunity to charge and kill, capturing many spoils of war. Another unit simultaneously breached the Japanese position at Xiaobu. The Japanese troops in Xinjie, upon hearing the news, sent a team to reinforce, and the battle intensified. The Liang regiment of the Chinese army launched a full-scale assault, holding out all night. The Japanese troops in Sanhua Store and Xiaobu were eventually unable to hold on and retreated in disarray to Xinjie and Xinminbu on the morning of the 18th. The Chinese forces recovered these strongholds. In this battle, over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and many guns and bullets were captured. The Japanese were constantly attacked by Chinese troops, so they concentrated their forces to defend their positions and sent troops to harass various places south of Conghua. After the Japanese troops who crossed the river from Hejiapu to attack Mumianyai and Lanchaikan on the 15th were repelled by Chinese troops, they were still unwilling to give up. On the 15th, over two hundred Japanese troops on the Guang-Cong line arrived at Changyaoling and Baitiangang. In the evening, they suddenly bombarded the Jiekou Zhushan area with sixty or seventy shells to probe the Chinese military's strength. On the morning of the 16th, approximately four hundred Japanese troops from Shengang harassed Mumianyai again. The Liang division of the Chinese army on that line retreated to the northwestern highlands in order to lure and annihilate the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops continued to advance, and were ambushed by Chinese troops south of Conghua City. The Japanese troops were blocked from the front and rear, and struggled desperately. By noon, all of them were unable to hold on and collapsed southward. The Chinese troops tracked and annihilated them, killing nearly a hundred Japanese soldiers, and recovered strongholds such as Mumianyai.

### Japanese Troops in Wuxi Reduced, Robberies Frequently Heard Inside and Outside the City

Wuxi Dispatch: The Japanese troops stationed here have suddenly decreased in the past two months. It is said that they have been transferred to other places to fight. There is only one guard at each city gate. The three Shuiguan gates in the north, south, and west have therefore stipulated opening and closing times. Ships carrying food and fuel are inconvenienced, and prices have risen as a result, causing suffering to the residents. Robberies are frequently heard inside and outside the city, and many occur in busy downtown areas during the day, leaving merchants and residents uneasy day and night. In the past two months, many Japanese soldiers outside the city have been killed by guerrillas, including some lower-ranking officers. Therefore, a guard post was also set up on the Tonghui Bridge outside the North Gate at the beginning of this month to check pedestrians.

Yongkang Region: Avg. 304.02, Med. 304.09, S.D. 84.64, Skew. (Negative) 0.002. Enshi Region: Avg. 157.99, Med. 156.90, S.D. 60.88, Skew. 0.050. Shanghai Region: Avg. 225.47, Med. 222.26, S.D. 75.54, Skew. 0.130. Kunming Region: Avg. 243.67, Med. 240.48, S.D. 92.98, Skew. 0.100. Qujiang Region: Avg. 202.79, Med. 204.35, S.D. 54.30, Skew. (Negative) 0.090. Nanzheng Region: Avg. 184.74, Med. 181.41, S.D. 59.58, Skew. 0.170. Lanzhou Region: Avg. 158.20, Med. 154.00, S.D. 55.86, Skew. 0.220.

(Negative) 0.001. Lantian Region: Avg. 215.35, Med. 211.79, S.D. 65.38, Skew. 0.160.

From the table above, we can see the leniency or strictness of the scores in each region. Although the test questions were unified this year, the leniency or strictness of the scores due to the grading in each region is unavoidable. Therefore, the method of adjustment must be used. The overall median score for each region in the table above is 196.98, so the median score of 196 will be used to adjust the scores in each region. However, it must be stated here that the overall median score of 196 is calculated based on the results from twelve regions, including Chongqing, Chenxi (including the Suo-li scores), Kunming, Guiyang, Guilin, Yanping, Yongkang, Enshi, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Qujiang. Because the results from each region arrived at different times, after the results from these twelve regions arrived, the results from other regions had not yet arrived, and at this time, due to time constraints, they had to be published urgently, so it was necessary to use the overall median score of the twelve regions that had arrived as the standard. In fact, the twelve regions accounted for the majority, and it is reasonable to use their overall median score as the standard. Secondly, it should be explained that although Hong Kong belongs to the Kunming region, due to the large number of people, and although Lantian belongs to the Chenxi region, the results had not yet arrived when it was first published, so they are listed separately as a unit, totaling seventeen units. The adjustments in each region are now listed below:

Marks to be Added for Chongqing Region (hereinafter referred to as "Add"): 35, Nanzheng Region: Add 16, Marks to be Subtracted for Kunming Region (hereinafter referred to as "Subtract"): 44, Guiyang Region: Subtract 35, Chenxi Region: Subtract 66, Guilin Region: Subtract 25, Yanping Region: Subtract 6, Shanghai Region: Subtract 25, Hong Kong Region: Add 39, Enshi Region: Add 40, Yongkang Region: Subtract 107, Qujiang Region: Subtract 7, Taihe Region: Subtract 18, Zhenping Region: Add 21, Chengdu Region: Add 56, Lanzhou Region: Add 43, Lantian Region: Subtract 5.

(2) Admission Standards: The distribution and adjustment of scores have been described above. So, how are admissions determined? The admission standards are now described in detail as follows: (a) Applicants whose total score for the written examination subjects, after adjustment, is 130 or above, and whose scores for Chinese, Foreign Language, and Mathematics are all non-zero, will be admitted after review. (b) Applicants who have optional examination subjects will have the scores of the optional examination subjects used to replace and included in the total score, and will then be processed in accordance with the preceding paragraph. (c) The admission of applicants with equivalent academic qualifications must be handled in accordance with Article 12 of the Outline of Methods (i.e., 10%, and limited to the top half of the overall ranking in each district and county). (d) Applicants applying for the Physical Education Department and the Physical Education and Military Specialist Course whose total score for the seven written examination subjects, after adjustment, is 140 or above, with a non-zero score in Chinese and a practical examination score that meets the prescribed standards, will be admitted after review.

### Xiqing Basketball: Xu Wenkui's Shooting Divinely Inspired, Qianghua vs. McKelvie Officer, Tied at 22 in the First Half, Resulting in 54 to 45, At Ease A-Kui Scored 42 Points Alone

Last night, in the Xiqing basketball Group A match between Qianghua and the McKelvie Officer, both sides were evenly matched and the competition was fierce. Xu Wenkui of Qianghua's strange shots were at ease, as if divinely inspired, scoring 41 points alone with 17 throws and 8 free throws, 32 points in the second half. Except for Bao Qing's one free throw and Shao Qing's one throw, he was responsible for all the rest. Truly a miracle! After the initial contact, Qianghua immediately scored six points and took the lead at 13 to 6. The officer quickly attacked, forcing the score to 13-13. Xu and Chen fired from the left and right, surpassing the score by four points. Wang Erde and Bryce scored three consecutive goals, coming from behind. At the end of the first half, the score was tied at 22-22. After switching sides, Wang Erde first scored one point from a free throw. Wen Kui suddenly increased the score by five points. After that, Wen Kui's wonderful shots continued, as if entering a no-man's land. At 33 to 27, Wang Erde was called out on fouls, and Qianghua took a remote lead of 12 points twice, at 41 to 29 and 45 to 33. McKelvie also announced his rejection, and the qi did not show in the form, and he made up to 43 to 48, and 45 to 50, only five points behind.

The veteran Ma Shaner is also expected to play today, so the Portuguese merchants' defense line is clearly not as weak as before. It is expected that the atmosphere at today's game will not be as calm as usual. Today's schedule is as follows:

### The Authorities Protect Law-Abiding Rice Merchants and Maintain Security in the Two Concessions; Those Attempting to Raise Rice Prices Have Been Warned; Various Industries Plan to Form a Civil Food Regulation Association; Common People in Western Shanghai Rise Up to Seize Rice

On the tenth of this month, the authorities of the two concessions jointly issued a notice stating, "It has been found that some individuals, greedy for personal gain and disregarding the suffering of the common people, are hoarding, speculating, and monopolizing rice (omission)... Regardless of who commits the aforementioned acts, the two concessions will not protect them." It is clarified that the aforementioned notice refers specifically to a small number of speculative elements manipulating the rice market and has nothing to do with legitimate rice merchants. To avoid misunderstandings among the citizens, the authorities of the two concessions have instructed the police to give special protection to all law-abiding rice merchants in order to maintain security. This matter has been communicated by the Public Works Department to the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, so that all members of the association can operate their businesses with peace of mind.

The letter from the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to the Rice Merchants Association reads: "In response, the notice posted by this Bureau on the thirteenth of this month was not specifically directed at your association's legitimate business members but was actually issued to curb hoarding and manipulation. Furthermore, this Bureau has already consulted the Police Department to do its utmost to protect and allow all rice shops to operate as usual without disturbance."

Six Chinese individuals (not rice industry leaders) had manipulated the market before the authorities of the two concessions issued the above notice, intending to raise rice prices. They were summoned by the Public Works Department police on the afternoon of the fourteenth of this month and given a stern warning. At the time, a representative from the French Concession police was also present. All of the Chinese individuals have promised not to engage in such activities again.

### Citywide Commercial Organizations Gather for Discussion

Yesterday at noon, various commercial organizations in the city gathered to discuss the food supply problem. Representatives from over thirty associations and guilds, including those from the banking, money exchange, shipping, insurance, timber, bookselling, hotel, silk and satin, restaurant, new medicine, transshipment and customs clearance, pharmaceutical factory, Chinese cigarette, currency exchange, rubber products, and rice industries, as well as Xu Jileng, Ma Jiliang, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Pan Yangyao, Wei Bozhen, Li Wenjie, Wang Haifan, and others representing the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association, and the Accountants Association, attended. Hua Dong Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, and Guo Shun were also invited to participate. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jileng, Lu Wenshao, and others expressed their opinions. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to designate Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jileng, Gui Yanfang, Zhang Jiguang, Wang Yuqing, Guo Shun, and others (eleven in total) to initiate the establishment of the Shanghai Civil Food Regulation Association to jointly discuss issues such as raising funds and ordering foreign rice.

### Management Committee Resolves on Measures

Yesterday afternoon, the Rice Market Management Committee held its 57th meeting at the Qinglian Pavilion public sample office on Fuzhou Road. Those present were Shi Shengbu, Lu Zhaozhen, Wu Wenbin, Cai Shengming, Yang Shaoyuan, Zhong Xusheng, Zhang Lizhong, Zheng Shengyun, Yin Fuxiang, Fu Qianheng, Gu Yisheng, Zhou Zhizhen, Zhang Yinnan, and Xu Yesun. Chairman Fu Qianheng reported that rice prices have fortunately fallen recently, but the rice-snatching trend is very strong, and the shops have suffered losses. It would be better to establish a public exchange to openly buy and sell rice, which could reduce the responsibility of fellow traders. The following resolutions were then made: (1) The organization method for the all-sector balanced food committee proposed by Committee Member Zhang Lizhong is as follows: (a) Handle the registration procedures for rice stored in warehouses and other registration certificate matters; (b) Set a deadline for the sale of stored rice; (c) Solicit donations for the price stabilization fund and handle loan advances. The above measures will be formulated into opinions, submitted to the main rice industry organizations for review, and then reported to the authorities of the two concessions, inviting important organizations throughout the city to jointly organize them. (2) Request the authorities of the two concessions to protect the rice transportation of legitimate business establishments.

Emergency Meeting of the Bean and Rice Industry: The association dispatched representatives Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Fu Qianheng, Zhou Zhizhen, and others to visit Deputy Director General He of the Public Works Department yesterday afternoon to explain the notice issued by the authorities of the two concessions on the tenth of this month and to present information regarding the six Chinese individuals who had been summoned. According to a report from a New Voice News Agency reporter who inquired at the Rice Exchange yesterday, the Bean and Rice Industry Association will hold an emergency joint meeting of supervisors and directors at 4 p.m. today regarding the notice from the authorities of the two concessions and the matter of the six Chinese individuals who were summoned.

Probation Granted for First-Time Rice-Snatching Offense: Recently, due to unprecedented rice prices, the lives of poor common people have become extremely difficult, reaching the point of near starvation. At 5:10 p.m. on the fourteenth, poor people from Jiangbei in the area of Rue Robert stormed into Ren Tai Rice Shop at No. 789 and snatched dozens of bags of white rice worth 1,665 yuan, fleeing in different directions. The police station on Putuo Road received a report and dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate, apprehending the perpetrators Zhang Wanhe, Ma Dongyu, Huang Youkuang, and Han Xiaoerzi, all from Jiangbei, and recovering eleven bags of rice. They were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted them for theft, explaining the situation and stating that current rice prices are unprecedented and that it is difficult for poor residents to make a living, but that such behavior violates criminal law and requesting a verdict. Liu Jianquan, the manager of Ren Tai Rice Shop, then gave an account of the situation at the time. The four defendants stammered in their confessions and begged for leniency. Judge Huang Risheng sentenced Huang Youkuang to three months in prison as a warning, and Zhang Wanhe, Ma Dongyu, and Han Xiaoerzi were each sentenced to three months in prison with a three-year suspended sentence. The eleven bags of stolen rice were returned to the original owner.

Pitiful Situation of Common People Resorting to Desperate Measures: Wanxing Rice Shop at No. 1954 Jing'an Temple Road (west of Zhaofeng Road) has only been open in the morning and closed in the afternoon in recent days to prevent rice snatching. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 p.m. yesterday, about a hundred poor people, carrying rice containers such as washbasins, cloth bags, and tin cans, gathered on the sidewalk in front of the shop, claiming to buy rice. They pried off two doors of the shop. Just as the poor people were about to start snatching rice, the Jing'an Temple police station received a report and dispatched over ten Chinese and foreign detectives by car. The poor people, though startled, stopped snatching rice but remained gathered and threw stones at the shop. The owner of the shop sneaked out to report to the Jing'an Temple Road pseudo-police substation. After fifteen minutes, about twenty pseudo-police arrived and raised their gun butts, indiscriminately striking the poor people, who cried out in pain and scattered. Onlookers were saddened by the scene.

Therefore, the rice shops in western Shanghai all announced that they were closed from 2 p.m. yesterday. A reporter from the Chinese News Agency inquired with Sun Laijun, a prominent figure in the western Shanghai rice industry. According to him, the rice shops in western Shanghai now plan to set the price of indica rice at 32 to 36 yuan per shi and domestic rice at 37 to 38 yuan per shi. They will reopen for business as usual tomorrow (i.e., today), but to prevent unexpected incidents, they have requested the Public Concession Police Department and the "Great Way Municipal Government" to send police to protect each rice shop.

A Person Beaten to Death on Pinlang Road

At about 5 p.m. yesterday, a rice shop located at No. 1309 Pinlang Road near Machi Road in western Shanghai was suddenly stormed by one hundred and several tens of male and female impoverished commoners who swarmed into the shop and the place where rice was stacked, and began to snatch rice. At the time, all the poor people were holding different things such as bamboo baskets, bamboo crates, cloth bags, wooden boxes, and even metal pots, and began to snatch rice the moment they saw it, regardless of the circumstances. The younger and stronger people led the way. There was snatching and grabbing, and the situation was chaotic. There was loud shouting and noise, and the atmosphere was in complete disarray. The old cashier and the shop assistants of the rice shop, seeing the violent scene, urgently tried to block them, but they were outnumbered and there was no way to stop them. Therefore, they picked up bamboo sticks and wooden clubs and used them as temporary weapons, and started hitting the heads of the impoverished commoners in turns. Therefore, it became a situation of mutual beatings. The order was extremely chaotic, and screams and cries shook the heavens and the earth. As a result, there were many people who were injured and bleeding, and many who had broken bones and broken skin, and the scene was shocking. Fortunately, the detectives and police officers rushed to the scene after hearing the news and tried their best to control the situation, so it gradually subsided. As a result, although the rice shop suffered considerable losses, one of the women among the impoverished commoners died on the spot after being fatally wounded by a stick. In addition, there were six men who also suffered similar injuries, and their condition was serious. The situation was extremely tragic. The detectives and police officers had already taken them to the Labor Hospital for treatment by patrol car and made arrangements for the aftermath. In addition, a rice shop located at No. 76 Singapore Road was also attacked by dozens of impoverished commoners at around 7:15 p.m. last night, and the shop lost about 20 dan of white rice. All the rice-snatchers were arrested by the detectives on the spot and taken to the police station for interrogation.

### Li Wenyuan's Troops Recapture Sanzao

On the seventh of this month, Li Wenyuan, the commander of the 4th Detachment of the Righteous and Patriotic National Salvation Army, personally led the 1st and 2nd Battalions from the border of Fengxian towards Sanzao Town in the 7th District of Nanhui. On the eighth, they arrived at Yijia Bridge, only five or six li from Sanzao. Wu Zhenhai, the commander of the 4th Battalion, led his troops directly to Sanzao. Commander Li led his directly subordinated 1st Battalion in a

Bypass Maneuver

and sent a letter to Lian Baisheng, the commander of the 2nd District Battalion of the National Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps, requesting him to lead his troops to advance westward and ambush near Yanqiao to provide support. They surrounded and intercepted the puppet troops of Chen Huanghe in Sanzao. The puppet troops initially resisted stubbornly based on the fortifications, but were then bravely attacked by the Chinese army, who swept them away like withered leaves. By the morning of the ninth, the

Puppet Troops Collapsed

and retreated, abandoning corpses all over the field. The puppet commander Chen Huanghe fled for his life, crossing several riverbanks to escape with his life. Afterwards, the Japanese and puppet troops from Xinchang and other areas rushed to reinforce them, and engaged in fierce battles with Li and Wu's troops. The Japanese army suffered fifteen or sixteen deaths and more than ten injuries. The puppet troops suffered countless casualties. The Chinese army also sustained

Considerable Damage

and are still in a stalemate. When Li Wenyuan advanced on Sanzao, he had agreed with Xu Chengde, the commander of the 5th Battalion of the National Salvation Army, to simultaneously intercept Situan Cang to form a flanking maneuver. On the morning of the tenth, Xu's troops were

Attacking Situan Cang

fiercely and were about to conquer it when they were unexpectedly outflanked by the Japanese and puppet troops from Zhuqiao. Due to the great disparity in numbers and lack of mutual support, Xu's troops fought bravely but were overwhelmed, resulting in the heroic sacrifice of more than ten soldiers.

### Yongan's Third Factory Resumed Work Yesterday; Four Demands to be Answered Today

The Yongan Textile Third Factory on Macgen Road, after Yu Qiaqing dispatched a representative to the factory along with Gu Bingyuan from the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department the day before yesterday to convene a reconciliation between labor and management, temporarily reached a resolution after a day of consultations, starting at 12:00 p.m. that night.

The worker representatives, based on the principle of cherishing the factory and for the sake of the health of more than 3,500 male and female workers, agreed to the two representatives' advice and ordered the workers who were originally doing day work to remain in the factory to prepare for resuming work yesterday morning, while the rest returned home to rest. Yesterday (the fifteenth) was the date for the factory to pay wages, but because the factory's funds were insufficient, it was decided to pay them this afternoon. After work resumed yesterday morning, the general workers did not feel tired due to being confined in the factory for two days, so they worked even more enthusiastically.

The Swatow, a regular liner of the Taikoo Company's northern line, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin at around 10 a.m. yesterday. At 11 a.m., when it arrived at the Bund outside the Garden Bridge, near the Lujiazui riverfront, a Japanese naval military police boat, with two Japanese military policemen and two Chinese detectives from the water police station, ordered the Swatow to anchor. The ship immediately stopped. The two Japanese soldiers and the Chinese detectives boarded the ship and wanted to detain the ship's Chinese clerk. The shipowner asked the Japanese soldiers what the clerk's crime was. They said he was involved in smuggling with Hankou. The shipowner asked to see the evidence, but the Japanese soldiers did not answer. The shipowner refused to allow the arrest. The Japanese soldiers, unable to get what they wanted, left in their small boat. The Swatow then weighed anchor and sailed south, mooring at the company's wharf on the Bund outside the concession at noon. The shipowner ordered the Chinese clerk to be monitored on board and reported the incident of the Japanese military police boarding the ship and arresting people without cause and the temporary detention of the Chinese clerk to the Shanghai office. After a thorough investigation of the Chinese clerk, the matter will be handled accordingly.

### Japanese Man Who Assaulted British Police Sergeant Released by Japanese Authorities; Police Authorities Express Deep Surprise

Senior officials of the Public Concession Police expressed great surprise last night at the statement issued by the Japanese Consulate Police Station that the four Japanese men who had a brawl with British Police Sergeant Kim on the evening of the thirteenth had been released by the Japanese police station after being warned the next day. According to this information, a Japanese news agency

Published Last Noon, the reporter from the English-language Da Mei Evening News had inquired with the police authorities, and they denied that this information was accurate, saying that the case must wait until Kim's injuries recovered before he could personally testify in the Japanese consulate court, and then the trial would be opened. However, the Information Section of the Japanese Consulate General denied the denial last night, and the reporter from the Renzhong News Agency then

Inquired with the Police Authorities, who expressed deep surprise at the statements made by the Japanese police station and the Information Section, because the Japanese authorities initially held a very serious view of this case. The case occurred at 7:30 p.m. on the thirteenth, at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road. At that time, British Police Sergeant Kim was driving away prostitutes when five Japanese men suddenly came forward to interfere, resulting in a

Conflict with Kim. Four of the Japanese men even punched and kicked Kim, injuring his abdomen. However, another Japanese man did not participate in the assault and tried to stop his companions' violent behavior, but to no effect. The four assaulting Japanese men then tried to drag Kim into

A car they had hired from Hongkou, which was parked on the side of the road, intending to drive him to north of the Suzhou Creek. Fortunately, passing British soldiers rushed to rescue him, and the police also dispatched a patrol car after hearing the news, arresting three of the assaulting Japanese men and one Japanese man who did not assault him. The latter was

Subsequently Released. The former three were handed over to the Japanese consulate police station the next morning. At that time, the information received was that they would be charged in the Japanese consulate court. However, last night, the Japanese police station announced that they had been released, and the announcement that four people had been released was actually incorrect.

### Mao Liying Dies Yesterday Due to Lack of Medical Treatment for Serious Injuries from Assassination; News of Her Death Grieves All Circles; Funeral to be Held at International Funeral Parlor Tomorrow

Ms. Mao Liying, chairperson of the Chinese Professional Women's Club on Nanjing Road, was suddenly attacked by two thugs at around 7:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the twelfth of this month while walking near the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road. Unable to dodge in time, she was shot in the abdomen and legs. The two thugs then fled northwest amid the chaotic situation.

Dies From Serious Injuries

After being shot, Ms. Mao immediately fell to the ground. Nearby police officers immediately pursued the perpetrators, while others took Ms. Mao to Renji Hospital for treatment. Although Ms. Mao lost a great deal of blood at the time, her condition improved once after the doctors exerted all their efforts to treat her, and her relatives and friends were relieved. However, due to the severity of the injuries, and Ms. Mao suffering from a stomach illness after the operation, her body was unable to support her. She died at 2:12 p.m. yesterday despite all efforts to save her.

Enthusiastic about Social Causes During Her Lifetime

Ms. Mao was from Hangzhou, 28 years old, and unmarried. She had worked at the Jianghai Customs for seven years. Two years ago, she resolutely resigned and went to work inland. After returning to Shanghai last winter due to her mother's death, she served as an English professor at Qixiu Girls' School. In her spare time, she engaged in social work, serving as the chairperson of the Chinese Professional Women's Club, making remarkable contributions to promoting women's careers. Ms. Mao's personality was open-minded and bold, and she was also willing to take responsibility. She was enthusiastic and hardworking in all social work, such as helping refugees. Her attitude towards people was amiable, and she was strict and self-disciplined. Therefore, people in society were all moved by her and admired her personality.

Organized Charity Sale to Help Refugees

After Ms. Mao took charge of the Chinese Professional Women's Club, she was responsible for organizing a charity sale of goods in July this year to raise funds for the summer hygiene of refugees, which was widely supported by all parties. Although she was disturbed by the conspiracies of traitors at the time, who intended to prevent her from doing so, and some people advised her to leave Shanghai immediately, saying that the traitors would be unfavorable to her, Ms. Mao did not pay attention because the charity sale was purely to help refugees and had no political meaning. She personally wrote the couplet "Born for charity sale, die for charity sale" and worked hard on it, achieving great success. Unexpectedly, not long afterwards, she was poisoned, and Ms. Mao's words during her lifetime became a prophecy.

News of Her Death Grieves All

Before she was assassinated and died, Ms. Mao said to her friends, "I ask myself that I am about to die, but I died because of saving refugees. I hope you will not be sad and continue to work hard on relief work." Her friends all felt that her personality was noble. After Ms. Mao was assassinated, friends from all over the world sent telegrams of condolence. Today, when the news of her death was announced, all parties were extremely saddened. Her relatives and friends in the area have formed a funeral committee to take care of the aftermath. A funeral will be held at 2:00 p.m. on the 17th of this month at the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road. It is said that Ms. Mao's relatives and friends in the area will all attend to express their condolences, and it is scheduled to be open to the public for viewing starting at 4:00 p.m. today.

Concession Authorities Investigate Perpetrators

After Ms. Mao was assassinated, the two thugs sped from Sichuan Road to Ningbo Road, took a black car that was pre-parked there, and fled west together. Ten minutes later, the car drove near the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route Hode, where it encountered a team of Chinese, Western, and Japanese patrol officers patrolling the road. The thugs, in desperation, fired at the patrol officers from the car, and one of the Japanese officers was hit by a bullet, barely escaping death. The car continued to flee west and drove into a house at a certain number on Route d'Ecuille in western Shanghai. The pistol used in this assassination case, after being inspected by the police's firearms expert, was found to have been issued to a certain Chinese man in western Shanghai. With the perpetrator having been identified, the Public Concession Police immediately notified the Japanese Military Police Western District Commander at No. 94 Route d'Ecuille, requesting assistance with the investigation. The Japanese Military Police Commander expressed his willingness to cooperate with the investigation, but there has been no progress to date.

### Two Detained Chinese Detectives to Be Released; The Puppet Regime Must Perform a Farce Before Releasing Them

Sun Peihe and Xu Jianbi, two Chinese detectives from the Public Concession, who were performing their duties at the intersection of Rue Robert and Penang Road last month on the 19th, were detained by the Japanese military police due to a conflict with a puppet official. They were once arbitrarily brought to the puppet "Shanghai West District Court" for trial, and were scheduled to be questioned again today. However, according to reliable sources, the Japanese military authorities have agreed to release the two Chinese detectives today. It is also learned that before the release, a farcical trial will still be staged at the puppet "court" on Avenue Road. At that time, the puppet prosecutor will charge Sun and Xu with "attempted assault" and "violence," and the puppet judge will sentence them, then announce that Sun and Xu have been detained for many days, as a set-off for the "prison term," and can be released, thus ending this major public case. The reason why the puppet regime wants to perform this double-dealing comedy is to end this public case of attempting to intimidate Chinese detectives performing their duties, while also wanting to preserve the "authority" and "face" of the puppet "court."

### The Japanese and Puppets Seize the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau; Li Jiannan, Puppet Customs Superintendent, Appointed Director; Japanese National Fujisawa Appointed Chief Engineer

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident in 1937, the Shanghai Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau has ceased operations due to the dredging vessels being seized by the Japanese army. This summer, after negotiations between the consuls of the relevant countries stationed in Shanghai and the Japanese Consul Miura Yoshiaki, an agreement was reached on December 1st to reorganize the internal structure. Li Jiannan, the puppet "Jianghai Customs Superintendent," was appointed as the director. The three members of the board of directors are Li Jiannan, Jianghai Customs Commissioner Robert, and the Japanese port director Sugiyama. It has been stipulated that the chief engineer will be replaced by a Japanese national, and the first appointee is Mr. Fujisawa. It is now learned that the bureau resumed operations yesterday.

Swire Charters Vessels to Dredge Wharf

The Continental Daily reports that Swire & Co. has chartered two dredgers and will soon begin dredging silt in front of the Swire Wharf in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River. This work will be carried out along the hundreds of feet long pontoon and wharf, and the last dredging of the wharf was two years ago, just before the outbreak of the Shanghai war. Yesterday (the 14th), a Swire & Co. official stated that although there is no urgent need for dredging now, this is a routine task that is carried out every two years. A Japanese spokesman recently stated that the resumption of work by the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau has nothing to do with Swire & Co.'s activities, as wharf dredging is always the responsibility of the wharf director, while the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau, which is managed by the Customs, only takes care of the main channels in the river.

The British Imperial Aircraft Detained at Weizhou Island Released; Australian Pilot Flew the Plane Off the Island and Arrived in Hong Kong on Wednesday

The North-China Daily News reports that a Japanese Navy spokesman announced yesterday (the 14th) that the British Imperial aircraft Dardanus, which had flown over Yanzhou Island in Tokyo Bay and was accused of violating Japanese military restrictions, forcing it to land on the island, had been released this Wednesday after 36 days. It was piloted by Australian pilot Wilson and flew from Weizhou Island to Hong Kong on Wednesday afternoon. On November 17th, a Japanese Navy plane flew to Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, carrying a replacement tire for the Dardanus back to Weizhou Island. The British pilot then also traveled by boat to the island.

### Hunan Steamer Carrying Gold, Silver, and Cash Seized by Customs; 35 Gold Bars Worth Over 100,000 Seized; Contraband Confiscated, Culprit Fled

The British Swire & Co.'s Hunan steamer, which arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong a few days ago, originally intended to sail to Tianjin. However, due to slight damage to the ship, repairs in Shanghai were ineffective, and it stopped sailing on the Beiyang line, changing to sail to Hong Kong for repairs. On the day before yesterday (the 14th), after loading cargo and passengers, it was scheduled to leave at 12:00 noon. Before weighing anchor, the customs patrol boarded the ship as usual to search for smuggled goods. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 a.m., the patrol found 35 privately carried gold bars, tens of thousands of silver coins, and tens of thousands of cash on the ship, totaling over 100,000, which were all taken to customs and confiscated. However, the smuggler had already escaped.

### Cousin Marries Cousin; Relationship Breaks Down; Wife Returns to Her Mother's Home in Anhui; Husband Sues for Cohabitation

Zhu Jiapu, a native of Anhui, is 27 years old this year. He studied police science in his youth and worked as a patrol officer in the Shanghai Municipal Police Department. His cousin, Cheng Zusuo, is 22 years old this year, beautiful, and has received considerable education. Because they are cousins, they visited each other frequently and married out of love three years ago. At first, the relationship between the two was very close, but after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Zhu Jiapu lost his job, and the couple's relationship gradually faded. Cheng Zusuo often returned to Anhui and did not return. On October 8th of this year, Zhu brought his wife, Cheng, from his wife's family to live together at No. 272 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. On the 20th of the same month, Cheng left again and did not return. Therefore, Zhu Jiapu filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting that Cheng Zusuo be ordered to return home and live together. The case was heard yesterday in the Seventh Civil Court by Judge Ma. The defendant, Cheng Zusuo, accompanied by Lawyer Yu Zhaolin, appeared in court and stated that the plaintiff, Zhu Jiapu, was violent and often abused the defendant, and even wanted to shoot the defendant to death with a gun, so she was determined not to live with the plaintiff. The plaintiff, Zhu Jiapu, testified in court that the defendant completely fabricated the facts and that the plaintiff had never abused the defendant. If the defendant often resides in her mother's home, there may be other changes in the future, so he requested the judge to order her to return home with him. The court persuaded the two parties for a long time, but because the two parties still insisted on their own arguments, the court announced that the case would be adjourned for further questioning.

### Fruit Store Owner Abuses His Wife; Wife Sues for Separation

Sun Jianhua, a native of Suzhou who lives at No. 9 Huasheng Fang, Diandang Street, Rue du Consulat, and owns the Heshun Fruit Store, was recently sued by his wife, Sun Gao (27 years old), from the same village, through a lawyer in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting mediation for separation. It is claimed that the plaintiff and the defendant were married in 1931. However, three days after the marriage, he stayed out all night. However, because she was a new bride, although she knew that he was having an affair, she did not inquire in detail. Later, because he was unemployed and had no income, he repeatedly forced her to borrow money from relatives and friends, totaling no less than 3,000 yuan. Now, eight years later, she has given birth to three children. Because of her efforts, in addition to setting up the Heshun Fruit Store, he is also a business shareholder in the Shenji Company. She privately comforted herself, thinking that the family situation could improve day by day. Unexpectedly, his old habits relapsed, and he gambled and whored again, seeing her as a thorn in his side. She suffered such a great shock and was so angry that she did not want to live. On August 29th of this year, she took sleeping pills to commit suicide. She was discovered by neighbors, who reported it to the French police, who sent her to the hospital for treatment. There is a record. After being discharged from the hospital, she returned to her mother's home and has been living there for several months, while he treats her as a stranger and never asks about her. Therefore, she had no choice but to request a mediation hearing, ordering the two parties to be allowed to separate and ordering him to pay the plaintiff and children's living expenses of 80 yuan in national currency per month, etc. After receiving the complaint, the court convened a mediation hearing yesterday, but neither party appeared in court.

### Shaoxing Wine Shop Robbed; One Bandit Shot and Captured; Sent to the Public Works Department Hospital for Treatment; The Other Two Bandits Escaped in the Confusion

At around 8:20 p.m. last night, three bandits suddenly rushed into Deng Futai Shaoxing Wine Shop at No. 4, Lane 104, Hubei Road (i.e., Yingchun Fang), and robbed it. At that time, one bandit with a gun threatened the old manager and accountant in the shop, forbidding them to make any noise or move. He then forced them to hand over the keys to the cash cabinet, which he searched. At this time, the cabinet happened to contain cash of

761 yuan, which all became the bandit's loot. However, the bandits were not satisfied. Two bandits unarmed groped and climbed to the mezzanine floor, and then forced the shop owner, Ye Zhenye, again, but Ye Zhenye did not have any money on him, only ten yuan in banknotes, which the bandits also robbed together. They went downstairs together and tried to escape through the door. The shop owner, etc.,

chased after them closely. When they reached the entrance of the lane, a patrol detective from the Old Zhabei Police Station happened to be coming towards them. When the pursuers saw him, they immediately ran up to inform him. Therefore, in a moment, detectives were all around and rushed to arrest them. The bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, fired their guns to resist arrest. The detectives also returned fire. After five or six shots were exchanged, the bandit with the gun

was shot down and captured. The other two bandits escaped in the confusion. The detectives immediately reported to the police station and sent a car to take the wounded bandit to the police station. After a brief interrogation, he claimed to be Sun Longyuan, 36 years old. He stammered about the rest of the details. At the same time, because his injuries were in the abdomen, the situation was very serious, so he was sent to the Public Works Department Hospital for treatment, and the search for accomplices was started to investigate together.

Later, Xia's family was notified and rushed to the scene, but the injuries were fatal, and he died soon after.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor,

I am writing to you in regards to a statement in the "Robbery and Shooting Case" section of the local news column on page eight of your newspaper on the fourteenth of this month which stated that my late husband, Yin Weijun, "used to run the Hanzhuang brothel and now sells piglets in Hongkou." Upon hearing this, I am extremely shocked. Before the war, my late husband was engaged in the gold standard business, and recently he was employed as an agent in the livestock market. These are both legitimate occupations. The wording in your newspaper is absurd and obviously based on false rumors. It concerns the reputation of the widow, so I urge you to correct the situation by publishing this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section in order to clarify the truth. This would be a great kindness. Sincerely, Yin Sun, December 14th Evening, No. 24, Lianzhu Lane, Avenue Edward VII.

### Hoarded Goods Gradually Emerge; Rice Prices Expected to Fall; Sources Still Controlled, Arrivals Dwindling; Rice Rush Spreads, Small Shops Suffer

The sources of rice, the goods blocked in Minhang, and over 100 boats of goods from Songjiang, Qingpu, Jinshan, and Nanqiao, 30 to 40 boats from Yangjiadu, and 260 to 270 cars of rice stored at various inland stations, all under control, with transportation permits not being issued, are all unable to carry out transportation. It is rumored that a certain party has transported all of them to Shanghai and Songjiang and transferred them to several large wheels parked there for export. Therefore, arrivals in this city are becoming scarcer.

As for the market, only the local rice market slightly moved yesterday, while general customers became more active again due to the recurrence of the rice rush. In view of the robbery of several rice shops such as the Rentai Company on Rue Robert, it was spread to Avenue Foch, Yanping Road, Avenue Road, Daxilu, Jingansi Road, and Avenue Edward VII. All rice shops closed early after hearing the alarm. As a result, rice shops have become lazy in importing rice, which also has an impact on the public's food supply. The rice shops are afraid of robbery and do not want to store too much rice. Among them, there are indeed some unscrupulous merchants, but this time the rice price has risen due to hoarding by speculators. General small rice shops sell as they import and do not have the power to manipulate the rice. First to suffer, it is only right to find a way to pacify the people's hearts. The authorities should adopt regulatory measures to suppress rice prices to enrich the people's food and strictly crack down on hoarding speculators while still protecting legitimate rice shops to facilitate circulation and maintain order.

Yesterday, sellers, whether merchants or speculators, were deeply afraid of punishment and sold off their goods in groups. The market's negotiable securities suddenly became abundant, and people's hearts softened. The sales market became more and more sluggish, forming a situation of only selling and not buying. The price of japonica rice and various high prices fell by more than one yuan compared to before. However, foreign rice is based on the exchange rate. Therefore, the owners are unwilling to sell lightly in order to take care of the whole body. However, its momentum has also weakened, and only 400 or 500 bags were traded. The closing market price was 35.23 yuan for round-grain Saigon and 35 yuan to 34.8 yuan for long-grain. Customer orders only opened at 33.5 yuan to 33 yuan, and rough rice was around 30 yuan.

Over 1,000 bags of customer orders continued to arrive from various ports in the Yangtze River yesterday, and the rice that was stored also sought to sell as soon as possible. As rice robberies have occurred in this city and the authorities have warned again, a large number of goods were sold back to the market, but there were few buyers. As a result, less than 1,000 bags were traded, and the price continued to fall by 1.5 yuan. Customer orders ranged from 34 yuan to 33 yuan.

Foreign rice orders continued to arrive, and the rear can still continue to arrive. The market showed weakness. Now Saigon No. 1 is 35 yuan and No. 2 is 33.12 yuan, which is more than one yuan less than before. However, because the price of land freight is not loose, the intention to sell has become firm. The early morning original bags also returned to 42.5 yuan, and remained small at 42 yuan in the afternoon.

### Flour Market Stabilized, Wheat Showing Signs of Looseness

Flour: Yesterday, the flour mill market price remained unchanged at $8.70. The market is also trending towards stability. Due to the high cost of wheat, flour mills, despite having raised flour prices, are still significantly below cost. Therefore, they can only supply local streets and restrict large wholesale sales. However, recently, actual sales to local customers have also decreased, making it difficult for the market to rise again. Second-hand goods are scarce, with selling prices two or three cents higher than the mill price. Green Cannon flour is priced at $9.00. Total market transactions amounted to over 30,000 bags. It is rumored that a northern merchant purchased 1,000-2,000 bags of Red God of Wealth flour at a price of $7.90. Transactions for Japanese flour were not significant. Phoenix flour for early December opened at $8.22 and quickly reached $8.17-8.18, while January flour was priced at $8.68-8.70.

Wheat: Yesterday's market was flat and weak, with mills maintaining good purchasing interest. Merchants were also actively seeking supplies. However, the situation seems unlikely to improve further, as mills are now emphasizing careful purchasing. Current wheat prices are too high, and flour prices are difficult to raise sufficiently, so they are unwilling to continue increasing prices for purchases. Total market sales opened at $15.00 for Changshu and Suzhou wheat, and $14.70 for Wuhu wheat. Fuxin Mill purchased 8,000 bags, and Fufeng Mill purchased 7,500 bags. Furthermore, the market saw transactions of six carts of Wuxi and Danyang wheat, priced at $14.85-$14.80.

### Finance: Hong Kong Again Dumps Foreign Exchange

The unofficial market for British and American exchange was mediocre, with slight tightening and loosening observed throughout the day, ultimately resulting in a slight loosening. The day began with flat openings. Subsequently, speculators and foreign firms entered, causing a slight weakening. However, Hong Kong telegraphed a dump first, followed by sales from Jewish merchants, an American firm, and exporters, causing the market to quickly harden. At that time, British gold loosened to 4 pence 59375, while the American exchange hardened to $7.5625. Due to cotton and wheat settlements, the market briefly softened. However, at noon, Hong Kong telegraphed another sale, and North China also offered some sales, so the noon closing was 4 pence 578125 and $7.53125. The afternoon began calmly, but later, Nissin and Yuli and others came in to purchase, causing a slight softening again. By the evening closing, British gold was 4 pence 5625, and the American exchange was $7.50, loosening by 0.015625 and hardening by 0.0625 compared to the previous day, respectively. The futures trend mirrored the spot market.

At the morning opening, banks' selling prices for spot exchange were 4 pence 546875 for British gold and $7.4375 for the American exchange, unchanged from the previous day. After the opening, speculators were the first to enter and purchase, and importers also followed suit. It is estimated that Chinese merchants purchased American exchange for January at $7.34375 from a certain firm, and a foreign firm also purchased American exchange for January at $7.3125. At that time, spot prices also softened to 4 pence 53125 and $7.40625. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced at 0.075. Afterward, Hong Kong telegraphed a sudden dump, and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhipu also sold, causing the market to loosen. It is estimated that spot British gold was sold to Macagri and other foreign firms at 4 pence 5625 and 59375. Later, Jewish merchants and exporters sold spot American exchange to foreign firms at $7.50 and 5625, and American exchange for January at $7.4375. At that time, Macagri resold American exchange for the current month to colleagues at $7.5625. Subsequently, Chinese merchants and foreign firms resumed purchasing, causing the situation to soften slightly. British gold reached 4 pence 5615, and the American exchange reached $7.50, but it was difficult to settle at these prices at that time. Near noon, Hong Kong telegraphed another dump. At that time, Chinese firms also sold slightly, so the market loosened again. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegraphed a sale of spot British gold to a certain firm at 4 pence 59375, followed by a Chinese firm selling American exchange for January to a foreign firm at $7.4375. By the noon closing, banks' selling prices for spot exchange were 4 pence 578125 for British gold and $7.53125 for the American exchange, slightly loosening by 0.03125 and slightly hardening by 0.09375 compared to the morning opening, respectively.

Settlements Were Strong But Ultimately Showed Looseness

The market opened calmly and steadily in the afternoon, with no changes. Around 3:00 PM, Nissin and foreign firm Yuli came to settle, causing the situation to soften slightly. It is estimated that Nissin and Yuli purchased spot British gold at 4 pence 5625 and American exchange for January at $7.40625 and 375 from foreign firms. Afterward, buyers were satisfied, and the market closed in a calm state. The evening closing prices for banks' spot exchange were 4 pence 5625 for British gold and $7.50 for the American exchange. British gold for the current month was 4 pence 546875, and the American exchange was $7.46875. British gold for January was 4 pence 53125, and the American exchange was $7.375.

### Gold Market Showed Little Change, Transactions of Several Thousand Taels

Yesterday's market for spot gold bullion saw the unofficial market, despite a slight loosening in the exchange market, gold prices rebound by $5, primarily due to frequent aggressive purchasing by Hong Kong interests. Regarding the day's activity, initially, the market atmosphere was tight due to the softening of the exchange market. With buying momentum, prices rose again by $15, opening at $4,190. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange market suddenly hardened, and gold dealers and securities firms began to sell. Simultaneously, those with long positions from the previous day also sought to profit, causing the situation to soften immediately, although Hong Kong interests entrusted a certain gold dealer to buy over 300 taels. However, supply and demand remained unbalanced, causing prices to decline to a low of $4,145. At noon, due to the exchange market softening again, the noon closing was only reported at $4,161. In the afternoon, initially, under selling pressure from currency exchange firms, prices dropped by another $11. Subsequently, the exchange market softened, and Hong Kong interests renewed their buying momentum, causing individual sellers to return and purchase. Therefore, by the evening closing, prices had risen to $4,180. Total transactions for the day were approximately several thousand taels. Silver jewelry prices remained unchanged throughout the day. Customs gold and other types remained flat.

Bullion Only Good for Five Dollars

Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially rose by $15 due to the softening of the exchange market and good sentiment, with currency exchange firms purchasing 20 taels from gold dealers at $4,190. Shortly after, the foreign exchange suddenly loosened, immediately causing selling pressure. A certain gold dealer, a certain securities firm, and individual investors sold, and prices quickly declined by $45. Currency exchange firms sold 10 taels to gold dealers at $4,145. At that time, Hong Kong interests suddenly entrusted a certain gold dealer to purchase over 300 taels, rebounding by $23. Currency exchange firms traded 20 taels among themselves at $4,168. Subsequently, Hong Kong interests' purchasing interest was satisfied, and the exchange market continued to soften, causing prices to decline. Currency exchange firms traded 10 taels among themselves, again falling to $4,145. Afterward, due to the exchange market rebounding, gold dealers and securities firms who had sold in the morning returned and purchased, rebounding by $30. Silver jewelry firms sold 20 taels to gold dealers at $4,175. At noon, the exchange market softened again, causing a renewed downward trend. Silver jewelry firms and a certain silver dealer sold, again declining to $4,155. Near closing, a certain silver jewelry firm purchased dozens of taels on behalf of a client, increasing the price by $6. A certain silver jewelry firm purchased ten taels from a gold dealer at $4,161, setting the noon closing price.

Other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Slightly Firm, Foreign Stocks Lacking Features, British Merchants Pay Dividends

Yesterday's securities market saw only types A and B relatively stable, because the ninth lottery round was the earliest. This shows that even when the market has been fluctuating without rising or falling for a long time, people still have not forgotten about public bonds and are waiting for an opportunity to act, which has become a common psychology. However, there are many future changes, so attention must be paid. Yesterday's trend was still patterned, floating between 5 cents and 1 dime. The reason why transactions have not stopped is that these are unofficial transactions and the securities firm does not charge commission. As a result, highs and lows alternated, with a difference of only about 1 dime. The number of transactions was still more than 300,000 dollars. A simple table is listed below.

Stock transactions: Ten shares of Ningshao Company stock were traded at a price of $8.10.

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce was unremarkable. Due to recent disputes involving several industrial companies, there is a possibility of a strike. Generally nervous people are afraid, which is why the Jardine Matheson stock is so popular. At the close, there were buyers at $74.50, and many shares were traded at $75 and above throughout the day. This kind of uneasy feeling was also felt by rubber stocks, causing buyers to hesitate. However, buyers became active again at the close, and various stocks had eager supporters.

The board of directors of Jardine Matheson and various yarn mills of British merchants in Shanghai decided to pay an interim dividend of one dollar per share of national currency for 1939, which is scheduled to be paid on January 17 next year.

The board of directors of Kaitak Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by Xiangmao Foreign Firm, decided to hold the 19th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on December 28 to report the accounts and business conditions for the one-year period ending September 1939, to distribute the final dividend, and to re-elect directors and supervisors. It is reported that the profit for this session is more than 190,000 yuan of national currency, plus the accumulated profit of the previous session totaling more than 211,000 yuan. In addition to the two interim dividends that have been paid, each share is counted as 1 dime of national currency each time, and the final dividend of 4 dimes of national currency per share will be paid again. The total dividend payment for the whole year is 6 dimes of national currency per share. Once the shareholders' meeting is over, the final dividend can be paid.

London, 14th: Today's listed prices of British merchants' Far East companies' stocks saw alternating increases and decreases. Macagri Bank shares rose by half a pound to 8.5 pounds. HSBC's London-registered shares fell by half a pound to 81.5 pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares remained unchanged at 85 pounds. Kulac Rubber shares fell back by 1.5 pence to 21 shillings and 9 pence. The rest was flat.

London, 14th: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable, and there were no changes in the upper and lower grades of public bonds.

### Yarn and Cotton: Foreign Cotton Fell, Little Impact on Yarn Market

The yarn market has entered a calm phase, the rise has stopped, and the momentum is still strong. After several days of soaring, American cotton has reacted and fallen, so some of the long positions have come out, and the market is slightly weak. Generally high-minded people took the opportunity to buy when they were tired, and it was said that although the market price of American cotton had fallen, the degree of gradual increase had been deep, and there should be this reaction, which is not worth considering, so the local yarn market was not greatly affected.

Due to the sharp drop of five, six, and ten pounds of American cotton in the morning, people's hearts were slightly floating, and the price once called out was chaotic. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse dropped by seven or eight yuan to $734. Shortly after, some speculators believed that the buying opportunity had arrived and took advantage of the trend to buy, and the market rebounded again, jumping up by ten yuan in an instant to $744. It was heard that the actual needs were still stagnant in the middle, and the market was flat and weak. According to the transaction statistics in half a day, 2,000 packages were traded, and the market price of 20-count Bianma was not much different from the previous day. Shuangdiqiu fell by one yuan, and Tiannv fell by two yuan. The amounts bought by various gangs are listed on the left. Colleagues 1,845 Hong Kong 155 Statistics 2,000 packages

### American Cotton Reacted, Tong Cotton Also Fell, Transactions Were Slightly Clear

The transaction of local cotton has been reduced because the American cotton, which has been soaring for days, has fallen sharply, and the enthusiasm of the public has been slightly affected. However, those who hold goods generally believe that although American cotton has fallen back, the calculation price is still expensive, and there is still no intention to get rid of the cheap price, and buyers are willing to get in at a low price, so the two sides have become deadlocked. The price of Tongzhou cotton has fallen by two yuan, and the source of northern Jiangsu is calculated as 1,997 packages of Tong cotton, 628 packages of Changyinsha, and 1,260 packages of Beisha. The current cotton situation is as follows:

Tong Cotton 168.50 168.00 Colleagues Purchased 200 Packages

Also 169.00 Again 200 Packages

Tong Packed Cotton 175.50 Again 400 Pieces

Fire Machine Cotton 155.00 Again 200 Packages

Also 156.00 Again 200 Packages

Also 157.00 Again 200 Packages

Also 158.00 Again 180 Packages

Wooden Frame Cotton 160.00 Again 100 Packages

Suzhou Cotton 236.00 Shen Er Factory Purchased 20 Pieces

Changyinsha 161.50 Colleagues Purchased 545 Packages

Brazilian Cotton 235.75 Again 200 Pieces

Also 37.50 Again 200 Pieces

Another News: The market price of foreign cotton and the New York cotton market were more intense than ever before. The long-awaited return wind began to be seen yesterday. The price of chicken cotton fell by as much as fifty or sixty pounds, but the general public was very good. According to a telegram from New York, the market situation fell by more than 20 pounds in the early morning due to speculative sales, and then fell again due to the sales of the New Orleans gang and the liquidation of long positions. As a result, the closing price fell by 40 to 60 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market is very firm and still rises by more than eight rupees. Egypt fell by more than 100 pounds, and Liverpool fell by more than 20 pence.

Shanghai foreign cotton, because people's hearts are so good, they all plan to buy slightly at this opportunity of the return wind, so the hand goods between the industry are very lively because they have all obtained huge profits and are willing to get rid of the goods and seek cash as soon as possible. Their selling price is more than ten yuan lower than that of foreign firms per dan, so the transaction is very lively. Those in the industry who add code to the futures of the American cotton exchange were very enthusiastic yesterday. The market price of American cotton yesterday, converted into a factory price with an American exchange rate of 7.4375, is as follows:

20 Count American Mitlin 241.65

Also Again Lower Grade 237.15

32 Count Again 248.80

Also Again Lower Grade 242.55

42 Count Again 252.40

Also Again Lower Grade 244.55

### Piece Goods: Factory Prices Rose Sharply, Inconsistent with Market Prices, Transactions Were Therefore Sluggish

The cloth market has been improving step by step due to the raw materials of yarn and cotton. However, the cloth price is under the pressure of shrinking actual sales, and the exchange rate is weak. However, the foundation is stable, and the hoarders are very strong. Yesterday's market goods price was flat, and the factory prices were reported to be higher. In particular, the products of British merchants Jardine Matheson and Lun Chang were even more so. Lun Chang goods rose by 1.5 yuan for printed cloth according to the initial price at the end of last month, 2.4 yuan for Keji silk, and 3 yuan for Yuchou Gongduan. There is a huge difference between the hand goods selling price in the market and the factory price. The factory prices of Chinese merchants' factories are also not commensurate with the market prices. Hoarders are full of appetite and are not only cheap to enter, and blood-holding goods are not willing to compromise beyond the standard except for floating accounts. Therefore, transactions are not prosperous. 300 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, fine cloth grey cloth, and 200 boxes of printed cloth, more than 1,000 pieces of various flannel, Zhe 4, Dian Kua, and inland areas only have a small amount of additions.

Due to the decline in foreign cotton in the morning market of Dongbu, people's hearts have declined, and the leading fine cloth of white goods has dropped to 21.35 yuan per piece. Later, colleagues saw that the dyeing sales and hoarder intake in this street were still not weak, and the transaction of fine cloth and fine twill futures was about 1,000 pieces, and the market atmosphere rebounded, and the closing situation was tight again. The leading fine cloth opened at 21.7 yuan, which was 1 dime higher than the previous mention. The smallest price of Sijunzi Serge has been reduced to 6.55 dimes per yard, and the evening market is calling for 6.625 dimes, and Zhigong 6.9 dimes. Therefore, those who observe the market situation silently say that the price of piece goods has become a situation that is easy to rise and difficult to fall.

### Sugar Market: 8,000 Packages of Red Sugar Opened

Yesterday's sugar market was uniformly stable and profitable. All the inventory of the United Enterprise Department has been opened as scheduled and will be temporarily closed. It is estimated that there are 5,020 packages of Dutch red, 44 yuan, Taikoo H Mark car, 3,000 packages of oil bags, 40 yuan, and the public association's planned spot 24 coarse white, 58.20 yuan in this station, up 2 dimes, 6 or 7 dimes in foreign stations, 59.70 yuan newly arrived, and 58.5 yuan at the bottom. Dutch red MP mark is 45.5 yuan, and Taikoo car white has not risen or fallen much. West station B mark is 58 yuan, East station is 57.5 yuan, OX mark West station is 56.7 yuan, East station is 56.2 yuan, DY mark West station is 56.5 yuan, East station is 56 yuan, HX mark West station is 56 yuan, H mark East red is 43.5 yuan, Benmian white has risen by 1 yuan, Zhenji No. 1 is 58 yuan, and No. 1 has risen by half a yuan to 68 yuan, Jingming ice is 69.5 yuan, Guotang is still rising, Chao Gang opened more than 200 packages of Huanggang Qing, 45.5 yuan to 45.2 yuan, up half a yuan, Mianchi rose similarly, a total of 59 packages of 46.3 yuan, more than 200 packages of 46 yuan to 45.5 yuan, Guang Gang opened more than 100 packages of Dongxiang red, 44 yuan, up 2 yuan, Xinghua Gang opened Gong Ge Yang 50 outer packages, the price is 45 yuan in cash.

### North-South Goods Top Zhuang Vegetables 50 Yuan

Daylily has recently been sold actively in various places, and the market price has risen. The top Zhuang vegetables are in short supply and will be sold to 49 yuan. Yesterday, it called for 50 yuan, and then retreated accordingly. However, it is heard that goods have been loaded on the way and will arrive soon. The number is large, and it may be slightly loose at that time.

### Language Small Stories

— Zhu Yu

Difficult, Difficult

Language is a difficult thing, especially for those with shallow knowledge. Let me tell a story to prove it. In Spain, there is a language called Basque (Bagque) that is extremely difficult to learn, so difficult that even the devil cannot learn it. God punished the devil for tempting Eve by sending him to the Basque region. Unless he learned their language, he could not come out. After many years, the devil learned it and wanted to ascend to heaven to report, but he forgot what to say just after crossing a border bridge and could not ascend to heaven.

People are not devils, but language is too difficult. Liberate language!

Closed Off

The closed off nature of dialects is one of the most painful phenomena in language and can almost represent the backwardness of language. It is said that in Colchis, Greece, there are 300 dialects, and the area is still called the "Mountain of Dialects." In the past, there were two villages in Switzerland, only an hour's walk apart, but one spoke northern French and the other spoke southern French, and they despised each other and did not intermarry. In many places in Myanmar, there are only 30 or 40 families, but the language of the mother's family is not understood even by the closest neighbors. The languages of Central American natives are most capable of producing dialects. A pastor compiled a dictionary for them, but when the pastor returned ten years later, he found that his dictionary was completely unusable. The languages of American natives change too much, so an old Passamaquoddy Indian said "yes" as Chew-dech-a-loh, but their sons have changed to a-ha. Dialects are an obstacle to language progress, how to eliminate them?

Buddhist Language

Buddhists believe that the Magadhi language spoken by the Buddha is the root of all languages. It is said that Indian children must sit on a chair and be taught language by their parents when they are young. If one of the parents is from a different place, the child chooses one. But if the child cannot hear any language, he will speak Magadhi. If someone is born in the wilderness and does not hear human language, he will naturally learn Magadhi. Magadhi is used in all realms: hell, animal, demon, human, and Buddhist realms. There are 18 languages in the world, and each language changes, but Magadhi never changes and will eventually unify. Therefore, the Buddhist grammarian Katyayana said: "There is a language that is the root of all languages; it was spoken by people of all levels at the beginning of the world; it was also spoken by the supreme Buddha: this is Magadhi."

The miracle of Magadhi tells us that language must be unified, otherwise people cannot use the advantages of language. We hope that in a few years, our Chinese language will tend to unify so that there can be a new building on the 5,000-year cultural foundation.

### "The First Lesson"

— Mara

The night was very dark, but our excited faces were illuminated red by the all-encompassing firelight. We watched sorrowfully as the tallest house in the neighboring village gradually collapsed under the assault of the fire. Our hearts beat faster with anger.

The wind howled triumphantly from all directions in the fields. It found a good partner. The flames, aided by it, boiled like blood within people's bodies. Even the air was ignited, making us feel greatly suffocated. Our breath was almost stopped by the oppressive, terrifying sight of the fire. Before our eyes was only a dazzling expanse of firelight, leaping and bounding across the dark sky. The wind and fire twisted into a torrent, forming a symphony. We seemed to hear faint, cruel laughter. I knew they were finding satisfaction in others' suffering. The desperate cries of many around me pierced my heart and my thoughts, making me feel especially panicked.

Is this the "mopping-up" by "them"? Alas! The "countryside" is about to be "mopped up" by "them" until not a thread remains. Suddenly, a cold, steady voice rang in my ear.

Like the Pegasus constellation that saved Macmillan during his Arctic expedition, this cold voice rescued me from boundless chaos and grief. I saw a glimmer of light shining in the boundless darkness, and my heart became resolute and calm again. I had the courage to say, "The final victory will certainly be ours." My transformation was not without cause. The speaker was the person we usually found most unsatisfactory. He doubted the government but held great hope for the approaching enemy. He never wanted to listen to us outsiders. Now, he himself spoke the words above. His hoped-for "masters" had finally come to teach him a lesson. This was the "first lesson," yet also the most realistic and ruthless one!

The "first lesson" made him say such words. Wouldn't subsequent lessons force him to explode those words into action? Who can guarantee that the resentment accumulating in his heart will not lead him to raise the banner of resistance in the future?

Moved, I patted his shoulder to comfort him (he was the owner of that tallest house). I also enthusiastically encouraged him. We looked at each other in the firelight and smiled happily.

### Small Winter Scenery

— Jin Mang

The freezing wind slants the half-closed-eyed sun, sending a yellow chrysanthemum, barely blooming from the neighboring rooftop, drifting in front of the window.

Breathing a puff, the white, misty vapor disappears in an instant, revealing the hard red hands again.

Covering myself with a high, thick collar, I shiver and clench my teeth as I walk out of the lane. The lane seems wider and taller. Dust is stirred up by the wind, only to settle back down immediately. Although the sunlight glitters brightly, it feels like just a yellowish haze.

Pedestrians on the street squint with eyes as red as their noses. A gust of wind blows, tangling their curls. They turn their heads and blindly hurry forward, revealing blackish-purple lips that seem to both smile and cry.

On the street corner, a White Russian, hunched over, raises his other hand, the one not holding a tattered cloth bundle, waving it wildly at passersby and giving a thumbs-up while mumbling. The white skin beneath his torn clothes jumps and jumps; he smiles and approaches a child, who runs away in fright. Then he jumps toward a mangy little dog...

Many shouts are added to the roadside scene. On one side, children in long coats form a circle, their coattails sweeping the ground behind the crouching child's backside. When the wind comes, the coattails are swept under their crotches. Their hands are reddish-purple, but they pick up spinning tops.

On the other side of the road, a circle of passersby have paused their journey. Bursts of wailing emerge from within.

At the used bookstore, a person is dozing off. Dusk shines down. A gust of wind comes and flips open the motionless pages. The person quickly jumps up again...

...Returning to the lane that resembles a tunnel, the lane becomes low again. Rubbing my eyelids with my cold hands, I realize that my hands are still cold. A trembling shadow trembles a voice:

"...Sir, si...sir...pity...pity!...

Turning my head, disheveled, flower-like hair trembles, covering my eyes.

Picking up the cold, hard palm-leaf fan, I start the cold coal stove. A foreign resident's cold, hard heart feels a trace of warmth from the hand waving the fan. I pick up an old letter sent from thousands of miles away. The stove glows blue in the cold wind.

Facing the blurred words on the paper, facing the disordered, unfinished dinner—perhaps smoke is rising in the distant mountains too?—I glimpse the remnant chrysanthemum in front of the window.

I jump up and throw away the remnant chrysanthemum.

### On Slave Philosophy

— Mu Chang

The nature of a slave is not innate; rather, the slave system is. When we first cry "Mama," we are innocent and only know happiness. Only after growing up do we realize that we are fundamentally born as slaves. But naturally, even the ancestors of humanity could not have dreamed of their ya-yo-ya-yo (even a squeezed sound) beyond the hang-yo-hang-yo. From this perspective, the descendants of slaves are certainly not to be considered self-made. What is an anomaly, however, is that the cousins or sisters of slaves often believe that they are truly a generation being trampled upon, and take exploitation as their duty or even happiness, making "great enlightenment" under the master's knife and shouting: "Thank you, master, for the sharpness of your blade!" However, even if it is voluntary, there will inevitably be some painful, wry smiles at first; even if the heart is so calm, the skin and flesh still have some feeling, even though it has been labeled black.

"Wry smiles" are not good for the master, and this is only reasonable. Therefore, the master wants them to practice shouting "Benevolent! Benevolent!" The slaves' expression thus becomes even more calm: the calm expression formed at first is somewhat dizzy, even a bit faint from the heat, but later it gradually becomes natural, and thus the "filial sons and obedient grandsons" suffer.

But by a certain generation, the hearts of the "filial sons and obedient grandsons" are truly "without bitterness," especially for "scholars" who are well-versed in genetics. They are even more "greatly enlightened." Therefore, they are even more calm and gentle, not as crude as those who, when unable to suppress their anger, utter a loud "Mama." In this way, the master must bestow upon him the title of "philosopher"! Throughout the ages, geniuses have emerged, and the most interesting of them, it seems, was a certain "Epi-Head-Knocker" in Rome, who would attend great banquets of geniuses. Needless to say, he led the group in the capacity of a slave. During the banquet, the master twisted his arm in front of the guests, and the sight seemed very violent. Later, he finally kindly warned: Bending it further will break it. The master indeed bent it again, and it really broke. And Mr. Ai thus calmly concluded: "Didn't I tell you so?"

Arms are born to be broken for the master. Mr. Gu Hongming has an example to prove: Knees are born to kneel, buttocks are born to be beaten... But can it be said that Mr. Gu is the most standard "philosopher"? Before the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Mr. Gu actually cut off his queue, but after the third year of Xuantong, he actually grew his queue back, sat in a rickshaw, and circled around Beijing, which, although also had some "philosophical" implications, seemed more like a joke, and was also quite rebellious. Some, however, will adopt its essence: thus advocating that queues lead to beheadings, ears lead to arrows being inserted, and collarbones lead to chains being threaded through; but queues have long since vanished, ears are still only used for wives to pull, and arrows have become antiques, using guns to shoot is not as easy to aim as a target. In fact, throughout history, ears in various societies seem to be even more changeable: drooping down, like basset hounds; opening up like Zhongshan wolves, but still not very developed even now. Therefore, some are worried about it and have abolished the inserting of arrows and beheadings; but "currently" beheadings are still prevalent, the reason being hair, so it seems that only monks and nuns can benefit from this. "Benevolent! Benevolent!": Inserting arrows is long in the past, but now the target is even larger; as for threading chains, all that is needed is a pat on the chest and a handcuff.

In fact, when Tian Shi of Qi held a great banquet for his guests, although his style was the same as that of ancient Rome, his words, when heard by "humanity," seemed to contain some truth: Old Man Heaven is truly good, creating grains, fish, and birds for humanity, which is naturally to humanity's advantage. From the Middle Ages to the present day, grains, fish, and birds are indeed still in the mouths and anuses of humans, although some "substantial" ones are still soil and bark; and for mosquitoes, tigers, and leopards, there are mosquito coils and cages.

The truth of humanity—the master laughs, and the slaves also laugh.

But humanity also has its strange aspects, in addition to the "rebellious" aspects mentioned above, they also want to "compete for fish like bear paws," and they also want to "swallow arsenic to treat tigers." The former is the achievement of the masters, which is not incomprehensible; the latter is still the foolishness of the slaves, who have no "status."

Is this why the masters who "have status" do not promote "burning the boats"?——There is no fish and bear paws to eat and they cannot "go abroad for investigation" anymore. When the slaves do not help them, they have to "hold a blade in their mouths," "be bound backward," "coffin together," and "beg for death," to earn the title of "Defiant Marquis." Later, their descendants gradually decline and gradually forget that their ancestors were masters.

Thus, a line is added to the philosophy of slaves: "Heaven's way is to requite." They (the slaves) also forget whose power it is.

### On "Confucius" on the Silver Screen - A Reply to Mr. Zefu

— Fei Mu

Yesterday's newspaper published "A Small Suggestion" written by Mr. Zefu regarding "Confucius" on the silver screen. I was deeply moved after reading it. What Mr. Zefu calls a "small suggestion" is actually not so "small." What he mentioned is exactly what those responsible for the production are painstakingly anxious about.

Since Minhua announced the filming of "Confucius," we have received letters from many "interested parties," giving many valuable instructions, which reveal that the concern of the public for Chinese films is far beyond the general imagination. Especially for those working on the filming of "Confucius," it is an immediate encouragement, at least it makes me personally grateful to the point of tears.

Generally, people who have read the classics of sages and philosophers may not necessarily be clear about Confucius' life story, as well as the history, geography, and figures of that time. I myself am even more ashamed, and only recently have I become somewhat clear. Therefore, in the future "Confucius" film, the first chapter, right at the beginning, must first clearly introduce the relationships between the figures and the historical environment at that time. As for the content of the film, it has been decided to depict the life of Confucius.

Regarding the "romance" section, I regret to say that it is indeed absent. I think we can use more noble "emotions" to compensate for this lack.

"It is better to have no book than to believe everything in it." When writing historical dramas, one must find materials in the spaces where there are no words. In terms of truth in the history of the "Confucius" film, we can write about his deeds; as for depicting his spirit and personality, we have no choice but to borrow some artistic techniques and seek poetic truth. Therefore, when depicting Confucius' life, there is no need to be meticulous about the years and dates.

I am ashamed of my shallow learning and fear that I do not have the ability to film this film to perfection. I am always ready to accept the instructions of enthusiastic friends, and even if the film is made and released to the public, I will not hesitate to make changes if there are mistakes, and will do my best. I thank Mr. Zefu and all those who have taken the trouble to teach me.

### Zhang Eyun's "Voice" and "Delivery"

— Bing Jiu

Zhang Eyun is Wang Yaoqing's favorite disciple, renowned in the pear garden for her Qingyi role in the Cheng school. Her artistry is exquisite. She is truly a rare talent among female performers, her voice and delivery different from all others. Here, I will describe its unique characteristics:

"Voice" - The voices of female performers are mostly sharp and piercing, this is due to the female vocal cords and cannot be forced. Xue Yanqin's high-pitched and bright pronunciation is considered a treasure by connoisseurs. In fact, Xue's voice is more than enough in terms of being vigorous, but not enough in terms of being rounded. Eyun is the opposite, with a soft, melodious, water-like sound. It is a pity that she cannot be as loud and clear as Xue Yanqin when going high (Xin Yanqiu's use of fast sound to compensate for insufficient high pitch is not a good method). Smooth movement is like pearls rolling on a plate, with ups and downs controlled by the singer. Although the key she hits is not high, her pronunciation is clear. Insiders call it a skillful voice.

"Delivery" - Eyun's delivery initially followed Shu Mei, then she apprenticed to Yaoqing. Finally, the Cheng style delivery was mostly obtained from the instrumentalist Mu Tiefen. Although Mu was an instrumentalist, Eyun always treated him as a teacher. Mu played techniques with the famous actress Cheng Yanqiu for many years, deeply mastering his secrets. After assisting Zhang, he taught her all his insights. Therefore, almost every sentence of the Cheng style delivery sung by Eyun has its origin. Small tunes are melodious and moving. The beat is steady, simple and pure. Each time she sings, the sound and rhythm unfold, full of emotion and melody, unlike those who imitate Cheng style today. Therefore, they suppress high and bright tones and tend to take the meandering, subtle and depressing paths, intentionally seeking to be similar, but instead leave traces. Eyun imitates Cheng, emulating its charm, not seeking to be exactly alike, taking its essence and discarding its dross. The ending tone is strong and firm, tending towards the delicate. At first hearing, it seems to be similar to Xiao Yun's style, but lacking in purity and beauty, and with a slightly poorer foundation. In terms of resembling Lanfang, it is somewhat similar. But the tenderness of the small tune and transition sounds even more possess Hui Sheng's style. In short, Eyun's singing draws on the strengths of many, not being bound by minor details. Her attainments are considerable.

Dance Troupe Sketches

### Magazines (II)

— Xiao Tian

The tea dance times vary greatly among the various dance halls. Generally, there are four dance sessions. Places like Dahua and Xinhua are scheduled from 5 PM to 8 PM. However, Dahua actually doesn't open until 6 PM, while Xinhua opens slightly earlier. However, Dahua's sessions usually end after 7:30 PM, while Xinhua's end by 7:30 PM. In the eastern section, places like Dadong and Yunshang Daxin open as early as 3 PM. By 7:30 PM, the tea servers are moving the chairs, which is tantamount to giving eviction notices. I usually go to Dahua for tea dances, mainly because the time is suitable, the dance floor is spacious, and I am familiar with the staff and dance partners. Also, they don't charge for tea, so it is more convenient in many ways. Recently, I occasionally went to Dadong. The music and dance partners were both satisfactory, and the rotational music was also novel. However, I don't like the many glass pillars. Arcadia has luxurious decorations, splendid arrangements, comfortable seating, and pleasant music. There are also seven short plays every day, which are quite wonderful. It is truly a great place to go with a companion. It is a pity that it doesn't open until after 10 PM, and midnight is the peak time. Yesterday, I happened to pass by, but it wasn't even midnight yet. Messages were already frequently sent on my pillow. A country bumpkin is ultimately not fit for all-night revelry. As I was about to leave, a friend mocked me, saying, "With your elegant demeanor and uneasy heart, the orders from home are stricter than military orders, and the lion's might is ultimately stronger than friendship. The excuse of messages sent on the pillow is actually thinking of going to London, England." My friend is homely but good at jesting, and everyone considers him to be Dongfang Shuo. I said, "Dongfang Shuo was nine feet three inches tall, with eyes like hanging pearls and teeth like arranged shells. How can you compare him to this painted face?" Everyone laughed. I have always said that it is not wrong for us to seek pleasure in our spare time after work, but we must remember the words "Work while you work, play while you play." Tea dances at 3 PM interfere with work, and all-night revelry interferes with sleep. Both are inappropriate.

Wang Yurong, the golden pillar, is proficient in dancing. At the Metropolis, there is an old dance patron, Uncle Wang, whose dancing skills were taught by Yurong many years ago, which shows how long she has been in the business. Recently, she has been performing full-length operas, each lasting fifteen or sixteen quarters, so she has no time to indulge in dancing anymore. Zhao Meili and Wu Feihong of the Metropolis have recently hired teachers to learn Peking opera. Feihong has just started to learn "Tan Mu," and can only sing a few opening lines. Meili has already performed "June Snow" on the big stage. I did not go to see it because it was a daytime performance that conflicted with office hours. However, I heard people say that the makeup was not yet beautiful and good. With Zhao Ji's appearance, she should be able to reach the realm of beauty. However, the reason for the lack of beauty is the poor makeup technique.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Several Bankers as Patrons of Opera

People in the world, if not for fame, then for profit. Speaking of fame, he has already achieved success and fame. Who doesn't say that he is now a giant in the banking industry and a successor of the Tan school of opera? Speaking of profit, his monthly bank deposit interest, including rent, totals two or three thousand yuan in income. Does he still worry about not having enough to spend for his family of four (husband and wife, two daughters)? Master Yan views fame and profit as nothing. Therefore, although this banking tycoon runs to his house every day, he does not consider it rare. People welcome the God of Wealth, but they cannot welcome him into their homes. He often chases the God of Wealth away. Speaking of it, Master Yan is also very bad, very tricky. He possesses unique skills, but he doesn't pass them on to others, especially insiders. If they ask him for instructions, he won't take out his "treasured secrets." Take Chen Shaolin, for example, who is his former wife's brother. When Chen was alive, she urged Shaolin to ask her brother-in-law to learn skills. But how much did Chen get? In short, if you are an insider, if you expect him to pass on some real skills to you in order to make a lot of money in the future, that is wishful thinking. Like a certain banker, with his position as general manager and his very rich assets, no matter what, he will never go into acting and use the skills that Master Yu taught him to earn a living. Therefore, Master Yan truly does not hide anything and indeed teaches him some good tunes and good movements. There is another reason that allows Master Yan to be even more at ease, which is that this gentleman's innate talent is too poor. His voice is simply as loud as the sound of a fly flying. If he occasionally appears on stage as a guest performer, let alone the first row not being able to hear him, even the drummer and instrumentalist can only put together a haphazard performance.
