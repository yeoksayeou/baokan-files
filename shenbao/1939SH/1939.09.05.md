The British side has decided to adopt a policy of containment to prevent them from going out and harming merchant ships. It is also reported that Germany has recently built thirty submarines of 500 to 700 tons, all capable of carrying out sabotage operations at long range. Currently, Germany possesses sixty submarines. (Associated Press dispatch, 4th)

San Francisco – According to a New York broadcast, the German large merchant ship "Bremen," weighing 51,731 tons, was sailing in the Atlantic Ocean when it was detained by the British Navy. The ship was en route from New York to Germany when it heard that Britain had declared war on Germany. It changed course and steamed at full speed, attempting to escape into neutral waters to avoid detention. However, the British cruiser "Berwick" pursued it closely. The German ship was ultimately unable to escape. It is not yet known whether it was captured by the "Berwick" or another British warship. As far as is known, this is the first German ship captured by the British Navy since the outbreak of war between Britain and Germany. The ship carried many German passengers who will be detained along with the German crew. The ship was built in 1939 and belongs to the North German Lloyd, being Germany's largest merchant ship.

London – The British merchant ship "Athenia" (13,465 tons), which departed from Liverpool for Montreal, Canada, on Saturday, was sunk in the Atlantic Ocean today by a German warship firing a torpedo. Only eight passengers died in the explosion, and the rest were rescued. Among those rescued, forty-eight were injured, some with minor injuries and others with severe injuries. The ship was built in Glasgow in 1923 and registered there. After being hit by the torpedo, it sank rapidly. A British destroyer, upon receiving the ship's distress signal, sailed to the scene, which was 200 miles west of the Hebrides Islands off the coast of Scotland. The ship was hit by the torpedo at 4 a.m., when most passengers were asleep and many of the crew were off duty. It is reported that the German warship did not issue a warning before firing, which violates international law during wartime. The shipping company has received a telegram from the captain reporting that the crew and passengers, except for the eight who died in the explosion, have all been rescued by various rescue ships. According to intelligence, among the 311 American passengers on board, 65 boarded in Belfast, 101 in Liverpool, and 145 in Glasgow. A notice posted outside the Glasgow shipping company reads, "The ship 'Athenia' has been torpedoed. The crew and passengers, except for those who died in the explosion, have all been rescued by various ships." Since early this morning, a large number of Americans have gathered outside the shipping company to inquire about news of relatives and friends. In addition, local residents are inquiring about whether any crew members have died. It is reported that among the American passengers on the ship were ten female university students who were shortening their vacations in Europe to return home early. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

### French Troops March to the Front; Many British Aircraft Fly into German Territory to Drop Leaflets; Britain Warns the German People Not to Be Deceived by Hitler

The Hague, Netherlands – According to reports from the border area, many British aircraft flew into German airspace today, dropping a large number of leaflets with the heading "British Warning to the German People." The content stated: "German people, the German government has deliberately opened hostilities with Britain, knowing that the consequences would plunge the world into a more terrible situation than in 1914. Hitler has provided assurances to the world, declaring his commitment to peace, but this is self-deception, just like the statement made last September after the annexation of the Sudetenland that 'we have no other territorial demands in Europe.' Looking at the governments of various countries around the world, it is unprecedented to recklessly drive their people to death. This decision is without justification. Germany's territory and rights have never been threatened. Previously, no one hindered Germany's reoccupation of the Rhineland, annexation of Austria, and occupation of the Sudetenland. In short, Britain and other countries never wanted to hinder Germany's development if Germany did not infringe upon the independence of other nations. As for the various demands made by Germany, if they are reasonable, they can be fulfilled. US President Roosevelt proposed an honorable peace to the German people, but the German government not only refused to accept it, but also drove its people to the slaughterhouse. Having suffered the hardships of war, what hope is there of victory? For many years, you have been unable to access the truth, which is no different from being detained in a concentration camp. Britain does not hate Germany, and Germany does not have the strength for a long-term war. It is only because the Nazi Party rigorously controls the news that you cannot know the truth. In fact, Germany is on the verge of bankruptcy. Britain and its allies have abundant resources, strong will, and are well-equipped with soldiers and supplies. They cannot be deterred by empty words. Being forced to this point, the war must be carried out with severe measures until the German government is exhausted. However, you have the right to demand peace at any time, and we also desire peace. We are ready to make peace with any German government that has sincerity for peace." (Havas dispatch, 4th)

Berlin – According to the German official news agency, British military aircraft flew at high altitude over the Netherlands last night, attempting to reach the German border. After scattering some leaflets, they were repelled by German anti-aircraft guns. The news agency strongly stated that this action by Britain proves that it has violated the neutrality of the Netherlands. (Haitong dispatch, 4th)

British Volunteers Enlist

Washington – The sinking of the British mail ship "Athenia" by a torpedo, with the fate of 292 American passengers unknown, has been confirmed by a report from Ambassador Kennedy in Britain to the State Department. The news has shocked the general public here, who are reminded of the sinking of the British ship "Lusitania" by a German submarine during World War I. (The "Lusitania" was sunk on May 7, 1915, killing 1,195 people, including 124 Americans. This was one of the reasons why the United States joined the war in 1917.) White House Secretary Early stated that President Roosevelt has received an official report confirming that the "Athenia" was carrying refugees from Glasgow, northern Scotland, via Liverpool to the Canadian Federation, indicating that the ship was not transporting munitions. The general public here also said that the German government used cruel warfare tactics against Americans before the United States entered the war, and it is possible that the current Nazi government will do the same. This incident is bound to have a significant impact. Official sources said that President Roosevelt will submit a message tomorrow or the day after, requesting Congress to hold an emergency session within a week (according to the Constitution, Congress should hold a meeting within eight days after the President submits a message) and announce the implementation of the current Neutrality Act. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

London – When the House of Commons met this afternoon, the new First Lord of the Admiralty, Churchill, attended for the first time. Members cheered and paid tribute to him for a long time. Churchill immediately reported to the House on the sinking of the mail ship "Athenia," stating that the shipowner, Mr. Lyttleton, telegraphed that there were about 1,400 passengers on board, including more than 300 American passengers. This ship was by no means comparable to a reserve cruiser, and it was sunk without any prior warning, which is hateful. Among the passengers were more than 30 refugees from Poland and Czechoslovakia, who boarded the "Athenia" in Liverpool to travel west. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

New York – The British luxury mail ship "Queen Mary" arrived here safely today, dispelling concerns that the ship would not arrive safely in New York. The largest French mail ship, "Normandie," is still docked here. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

### Daladier Tells the French People to Fulfill Their Sacred Responsibilities

Paris – Prime Minister Daladier delivered a broadcast speech this evening, stating, "French men and French women, Poland has been subjected to the most brutal invasion since dawn on the first of this month. The border has been violated, and cities have been bombed. Polish troops are fighting bravely. The key to peace was originally in the hands of Führer Hitler. He ultimately chose the path of war. Therefore, the responsibility for this bloodshed should be borne entirely by the Nazi government. Looking back at Britain and France, they have continuously strived to save peace. Even this morning, they made urgent representations to the German government, demanding a cessation of hostilities and peace negotiations, but were rejected. All people of conscience in the world have recently called for world peace, but Germany has ignored them. Now it has rejected the demands of Britain and France, with the intention of destroying Poland, then further dominating Europe, and enslaving France, which is already clear. Under these circumstances, we have no choice but to fulfill our promise to defend our country and freedom, and to resist the most terrible tyranny. However, in the past, we have worked tirelessly to avoid war, until the last minute. We can ask ourselves without shame. Defending the country is a sacred duty. Before today, we have fulfilled our responsibilities to the fullest extent. Now is the time for young soldiers to fulfill their duties. I hereby pay tribute to them with emotion and affection. Their leaders will surely follow the loyal and courageous alliance of their predecessors and lead France to victory. The cause that our France upholds is a just cause, and it is also the cause of peace-loving nations. Now that we are forced to war, we will surely win. We hope that the people of the country will do their best, unite in sincerity, and save the motherland. Long live France!" (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

Editorial

### Shanghai in the European War

With Britain and France declaring war on Germany, the prelude to the European War has finally begun. The impact extends far and wide, affecting the entire world, and Shanghai is no exception. Shanghai is a complex mix of Chinese and foreigners, and in the midst of the Sino-Japanese War, it constitutes a "special international area." Precisely because of its international nature, the general public has a deep concern and strong interest in the European War. What most people want to know is how this war will directly benefit or harm China and Shanghai.

The vicissitudes of history are difficult to grasp, and making light speculations is foolish or absurd. Therefore, we do not wish to give any arbitrary answers to the above question. However, what can be said is that in this time of global turmoil, the Shanghai concessions are a refuge for millions of Chinese and foreign citizens. Upon examining the reasons for this, it is because since its opening, Shanghai has encountered various Chinese and foreign incidents, and the constraints of all parties have appropriately created its neutrality, which has ultimately been respected and feared by all parties. This is a benefit shared by both Chinese and foreign residents. Considering the fact that the Shanghai concessions have repeatedly been spared from the ravages of war, it can be seen that this statement is not wrong. Although the impact of this European War will extend far and wide to Shanghai, it is very far from the central area of actual combat, so there is no need to worry about its impact. Furthermore, the desire of the participating countries to maintain the neutrality of the Shanghai concessions can be said to be not very different. However, there are also those who worry that although the range of European artillery fire may not reach Shanghai, is there not a crisis in Shanghai's small environment that will erupt with the European War as an opportunity? We cannot guarantee that such concerns will not come true. However, to observe the overall situation, the key lies in the stability of Shanghai itself, so as not to cause a crisis to erupt. Indeed, as Shanghai is a special international area, as a certain Chinese director of the Public Concession said yesterday, after the outbreak of the European War, the Public Concession can be expected to have no impact. The greatest strength is that the United States does not participate in the war, and Italy is also standing aside. This statement is credible. Those who want to change the current state of the Public Concession will not be tolerated by the United States, and the United States today holds a pivotal position in international relations in the Far East. Moreover, the Public Concession was originally a supra-political international settlement, and the French Concession is by no means French territory. We dare to believe that it will not be directly involved in the vortex of the European War based on reason and sentiment. This is evidenced by the frank admission of officials from various countries stationed in Shanghai that foreigners in Shanghai are better off than in their own countries after the outbreak of the war, and that the German僑 within the French Concession have no intention of withdrawing, which is even more credible.

What we would like to tell the Chinese and foreign residents of the concession is: do not be misled by unfounded rumors and alarm each other. Residents of belligerent countries are expected to maintain calm, not to be agitated by wartime patriotism and cause narrow and meaningless disputes. There may be small gains and losses in disputes, but they do not help the overall situation. Why hinder this international settlement worth cherishing together!

Furthermore, in the future, navigation between Europe and Asia should not be cut off, but it is difficult to avoid the impact on shipping. Due to the scarcity of sources, high freight rates, and increased insurance costs, foreign goods in Shanghai will inevitably skyrocket, and most of the local native goods are intercepted by the Japanese army, which is not enough to meet the needs of Shanghai, let alone exports. This situation is quite different from the abnormal prosperity that Shanghai suddenly showed during the previous European War. Therefore, as far as the lives of residents in Shanghai concessions are concerned in the future, they will not only suffer from the skyrocketing exchange rates, but also the prices of foreign goods in the future are likely to be manipulated by hoarders, and will be further increased, thus suffering from double oppression. Shanghai's economic environment will inevitably worsen with the development of the European War! What is hoped is that the Shanghai Concession authorities can plan ahead, strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from causing trouble and profiting, and find ways to dredge the sources of goods. It is also hoped that financial capitalists, in addition to their normal and great mission, will especially provide financial support to small and medium-sized production enterprises in Shanghai, and will not use funds to help the evils of unscrupulous merchants and lengthen the greed of unscrupulous merchants. It may be possible to make Shanghai stably pass through the difficult stage of the influence of the near and far wars. It is important to know that at this moment, losing one less point of vitality is to increase one point of strength for future revival. This is also what the Chinese and foreign residents of Shanghai should cherish.

### President Roosevelt Announces American Neutrality; To Be Implemented Within 24 Hours

Washington: President Roosevelt has announced neutrality and has set a deadline of twenty-four hours to implement the current neutrality law. (Havas, 4th)

Washington: President Roosevelt gave a broadcast address this afternoon, stating briefly, "The United States government is currently drafting a declaration of neutrality regarding the European war. "I will do everything in my power to maintain peace for our people. However, it is difficult to predict how the situation will evolve in the future." This speech was translated into French and German and broadcast to Europe and Latin America by three radio stations after much effort to prevent a second world war. "Now that war has broken out, but I believe that we still have the right and reason to uphold all sacred ethical principles and strive to restore peace. Looking back at the unfortunate events that have occurred frequently in recent years, they are due to certain countries threatening at every turn by relying on force." The President began by saying that he still held out hope for peace regarding the European situation until the very last minute. "Until this morning, since Britain and France had already declared a state of war with Germany, this hope has turned into a bubble. Considering that the war has just begun, the United States government believes that the United States should still do everything in its power to strive for peace. Americans may shrug their shoulders and say that events in Europe are thousands of miles away from the United States and the American continent, and will not affect the United States. We can simply turn a deaf ear and a blind eye. Little do they know that although the United States wishes to stay out of it, in reality, any words uttered by others, any wars that occur abroad, and even any ships sailing on the sea, will inevitably affect the future of the United States. As for the economic impact that the European war may have on our country, it is certainly not difficult to imagine. Especially morally speaking, no American citizen has the right to take the opportunity to exploit their compatriots, or to exploit the European men, women, and children living under war. In short, the United States government is currently drafting a declaration of neutrality. The people of the country must not rashly say that the government is sending troops to the European battlefield. We all hold a belief in the value of the human spirit. The spirit suggested by the saints, which is the spirit of opposing the use of force, is still regarded by us as the ultimate goal." (Havas, 3rd)

### Japan Declares Conservatively Neutral Position on European War

Tokyo: According to the official statement issued by Prime Minister Abe to the newspapers today, Japan has firmly maintained neutrality and will not interfere in the European war. Japan will concentrate its efforts to seek a resolution to the China Incident. (Reuters, 4th)

Tokyo: This morning, when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs entertained journalists, they raised various questions. The most important was the official attitude of Japan towards the European situation. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that the government would soon officially decide its attitude towards the European issue, and is currently closely monitoring the development of the situation. When asked about Japan's attitude towards the ships of belligerent countries, the spokesperson replied that it would be decided in accordance with the official announcement to be issued later. When asked whether Ambassador Oshima to Germany had been recalled, the spokesperson replied that there was currently no information about Oshima returning home. When asked about the election of Wang Jingwei as Chairman of the Central Executive Committee by the Sixth National Kuomintang Congress held in Shanghai, the spokesperson replied that there were rumors that a new central government of China would be established on Double Ten Day, but he did not know whether this was true. The spokesperson mentioned the Soviet-Manchu border conflict, saying that the border incident, including the Nomonhan conflict, could be resolved through diplomatic channels, depending entirely on the attitude of the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union was willing, diplomatic negotiations on this matter could begin. However, there is currently no sign of negotiations on this matter. (Reuters, 4th)

Tokyo: This morning, Japanese newspapers paid considerable attention to Britain's declaration of war on Germany. Asahi Shimbun predicted that this European war would develop into a decisive battle, and that all capable and democratic countries would do their best to gain an advantage. As for whether the responsibility for this war lies with Hitler or with the Treaty of Versailles, it is still difficult to say. Yomiuri Shimbun said that when Hitler took action against Poland, he did not expect Britain to join the war. Hitler believed that he had won victories without bloodshed during the Sudetenland and Czech disputes, so he believed that he could achieve the same success in this decision regarding Poland without provoking Britain and France to join the war.

### French-Italian Border De-Restricted; Mussolini Still Conducting Peace Movement Claim

Nice, France: The border between France and Italy, which had been locked down a few days ago, was reopened today, and Italians were able to re-enter Italian territory. (Havas, 3rd)

Berlin: According to sources from the National Socialist Party, even though Britain and France have declared a state of war with Germany, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is still continuing to make a final effort for peace, so that Europe can avoid war. The Italian Ambassador to Germany also expressed this during a half-hour meeting with Hitler last night. Mussolini yesterday again presented the proposal for a five-power conference to Hitler, including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union, but not Poland. German troops in Polish territory must cease operations, which is different from the proposal of Britain and France. The suggestion in the British and French proposal required the invading German troops in Poland to withdraw. The National Socialist Party said that it was absolutely impossible for German troops to withdraw. It is said that France has expressed support for Mussolini's suggestion, but Britain has rejected it. Reliable sources in the German government said that if Britain and France had not taken military action against Germany first, they would never have opened fire on Britain and France first. A spokesperson for the National Socialist Party said, "But if they attack Germany, we will of course doubt them, just as we have done to Poland." The German side said that although Britain and France have declared a "state of war," it has no impact on the legal issue of the German-Polish conflict. The German-Polish conflict has reached the third day, but Germany does not recognize that Germany and Poland have already started a war. (Associated Press, 4th)

### Within Poland, Czech and Slovak Ethnic Groups Form Foreign Legion; Former Czech President Beneš Cables Chamberlain, Stating Czech People Are Also at War with Germany

A recent official communiqué from Warsaw states that Czech and Slovak people will form a foreign legion within Poland. Czech or Slovak people coming to Poland from other countries, or Polish citizens belonging to the Czech or Slovak ethnic groups, can apply to join this foreign legion. After its establishment, it will be placed under the command of the Polish army, but will still maintain its ethnic identity. General Smigly-Ridz, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, also issued a letter to the Slavic peoples, listing Germany's crimes, and stated that after Germany brazenly occupied Czechoslovakia, it is now attacking Poland with barbarous methods. He hopes that the Slavic peoples will rise up together and resist. In addition, General Prochazka, a former important figure in the Czechoslovak army, has been residing in Poland since the fall of his homeland, and has begun to recruit compatriots to form a foreign legion. (Havas, 4th)

The British Ambassador Kennedy, his wife, their two children, and fifty embassy staff members, along with other Americans, also took refuge in the specially built air raid shelter in the embassy. (Associated Press, 4th)

The headlights of private and public vehicles were extremely dim. Police officers on the streets wore blue steel helmets and carried first-aid kits and gas masks in case of emergency. Their flashlights constantly illuminated the sandbags beside the streets. (Associated Press, 4th)

Molotov's Foreign Policy Report (Continued from yesterday): "Since 1926, the political basis of our relations with Germany has been the Treaty of Neutrality between the two countries. This treaty was extended by the current German government in 1933 and remains in effect to this day. The Soviet government has long recognized the need to find ways to improve political relations with Germany, but circumstances have made this possible only now. Of course, we are not referring to the problem of mutual assistance discussed in the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations, but only to the pact of non-aggression. However, under the present conditions, the international significance of this Soviet-German pact cannot be ignored. Our emphasis on the visit of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to the Soviet Union is due to this reason. The conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact on August 23, 1939, should be regarded as a day of very great historical significance, because this Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact is a turning point in European history, and is not limited to Europe. "A few days ago, German fascists were still adopting a policy of hostility towards us. A few days ago, the two countries were still enemies in diplomacy. Today, the situation has changed dramatically. We are no longer enemies. The art of politics, in diplomatic relations, is not to increase one's enemies, but on the contrary, to reduce enemies, and to turn yesterday's enemies into good neighbors who maintain peaceful relations today. History has long proven that the results of mutual hostility and war between our country and Germany have only caused deep harm to both countries. The most severely affected during the Great War of 1914 to 1918 were Russia and Germany. Therefore, the interests of the Soviet and German peoples are definitely not in mutual enmity. On the contrary, both sides need peaceful relations. The Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact has ended the mutual hostility between the two countries, which is in line with the interests of both countries. The differences in the worldviews and political systems of the two countries should not and cannot hinder the establishment of friendly political relations between the two countries, just as the same differences do not prevent the Soviet Union from maintaining friendly political relations with other non-Soviet capitalist countries. Only the enemies of the Soviet Union and Germany are trying to create hostility between the peoples of the two countries. We have always advocated that the peoples of the Soviet Union and Germany should be friendly to each other and should strive to promote and develop their friendship. (Warm and sustained applause). "The main and important significance of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact is that the two largest countries in Europe have agreed to end mutual hostility, eliminate the crisis of war, and coexist peacefully, thereby reducing the areas in Europe where armed conflict is possible. If armed conflict in Europe becomes inevitable, the scope of hostile actions will also be more limited. Only those who aim to provoke a pan-European war, only those who, under the guise of pacifism, are plotting to ignite a pan-European catastrophe, can be dissatisfied with this situation. "Since the establishment of the Soviet-German Pact, it has been heavily attacked by British, French, and American newspapers. Certain "socialist" newspapers, which are loyal to their own country's capitalism, have been particularly energetic in this regard for a substantial reward. It is impossible to expect truth from this group of gentlemen. They will try to spread lies, claiming that the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance pact negotiations broke down because of the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. This is absurd, as Voroshilov has already exposed in his talks. In fact, the opposite is true. One of the reasons for the conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact is that the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations encountered insurmountable disputes due to the faults of the British and French bourgeoisie and ultimately failed. "Furthermore, they also attacked us, saying that the pact should not fail to include a clause stating that the pact would be terminated in the event that one of the signatory countries was drawn into war under conditions that others could accuse of being aggressors. But they forget that such a reservation was not included in the Polish-German Non-Aggression Pact concluded in 1934, which was cancelled by Germany without Poland's consent in 1939, nor was it included in the Anglo-German Non-Aggression Declaration signed a few months ago. From this, we can ask why the Soviet Union cannot invoke the rights that Poland and Britain have already exercised. "Finally, there are even those who are self-proclaimed clever and speculate on various other things outside the clear statements of the pact (laughter). They create various speculations and insinuations, causing various countries to doubt the pact. This kind of trick only exposes the incompetence of those who are hostile to the pact, exposes them as enemies of the Soviet Union and Germany, and attempts to provoke war between the two countries. In the above points, Stalin's warning to us, that we should pay special attention to those who are good at taking advantage of others' misfortune to provoke war, has been proven again and again. We must be vigilant at all times, because they benefit from the hostility between Germany and the Soviet Union. They especially do not want Germany and the Soviet Union to maintain peaceful and good-neighborly relations. We can understand why the one hundred percent imperialists implement this policy, but we must not ignore the fact that some leaders of the socialist parties in the United States and France have recently been particularly energetic in this regard. These gentlemen have probably sold themselves completely (laughter). What's more, they categorically demand that the Soviet Union join the British side in fighting against Germany. Are they out of their minds? (Laughter) Can they really not recognize the purpose of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact, and that the Soviet Union, according to the pact, should neither help Britain fight against Germany, nor help Germany fight against Britain? Can they really not recognize that the Soviet Union has always only pursued its independent policy based on the interests of its own people in the past and will continue to do so forever? (Sustained applause) If these gentlemen must fight, they can fight themselves, why involve the Soviet Union? (Laughter and applause) We will quietly observe what kind of fighting material they are made of (laughter and applause). "From the perspective of all Soviet people, these enemies of peace are no different from all other war-mongers in Europe. Only those who expect a great massacre, those who expect a chaotic war between countries, are the ones who are trying to destroy the newly restored good-neighborly relations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Germany. "The Soviet Union signed this pact with Germany because it firmly believes that maintaining peace between the Soviet and German peoples is in line with the interests of all peoples who desire universal peace. Every true advocate of peace must recognize this truth. This pact is also in line with the fundamental interests of the Soviet working masses and will not weaken our vigilance in defending the interests of the masses. This pact has the firm confidence of our country's strength as its backing, and has the full readiness to resist any aggression against the Soviet Union as its backing (warm applause).

This pact (like the unsuccessful Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations) proves that no major international issues and Eastern European issues can be resolved without the active participation of the Soviet Union, and proves that any attempt to resolve such issues by bypassing the Soviet Union will never succeed (applause). "The Soviet-German pact has caused a new turn in the development of the situation in Europe, a turn in the improvement of relations between the two largest countries in Europe. This pact not only eliminates the crisis of war between the Soviet Union and Germany, reduces the areas in Europe where war may occur, thereby benefiting peace, but also opens up new possibilities for us, enhances our country's strength, consolidates our country's position, and increases the Soviet Union's influence on the development of the international situation. We do not need to discuss the articles of the pact one by one. The Council of People's Commissars has reason to believe that this pact, as an extremely important document for the Soviet Union, will be approved by everyone (applause). "The Council of People's Commissars now presents the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact to the Supreme Soviet and recommends that it be ratified." (Warm and sustained applause, everyone stands up) (TASS, 31st)

### Various Parts of the British Empire Unanimously Support War Against Germany; George VI Issues Message to the People, Urging Unity and Steadfastness to Meet Difficult Times

London: King George VI of England last night broadcast a message to the people of Britain and the British Empire, urging them to face this difficult period with a calm and steadfast attitude and a spirit of unity. He stated in part: "The current situation is extremely serious, almost the most important autumn in our history and in our destiny. At this time, I am sending this message to British homes at home and abroad. My feelings are as intimate as if I were personally visiting my people and talking to them face to face. Most of us have now encountered the second great war in our lives. We have repeatedly strived to find a peaceful way to resolve the difficulties between us and those who are now our enemies, but our efforts have been in vain. We have been forced into war, and we and our allies must respond to a challenge to a principle, because if this principle is victorious, then any civilized order in the world will be destroyed. What is this principle? It is allowing a country to regard power as the only thing that matters, disregarding treaties, disregarding good faith, and using force or threats to the detriment of the sovereignty and independence of other countries. This principle is, in reality, nothing more than the doctrine that might makes right. If this principle is established in a world, then our own mountains will be in danger. Not only this, but all the people in the world will be in a state of panic, and all hopes for peace, security, justice and freedom among countries will be extinguished. This is the greatest problem facing us now. In order to maintain what we hold dear, and in order to maintain world order and peace, we must respond to this challenge. I am now announcing to the people at home and abroad whose purpose is our purpose, to go to this noble purpose together. I urge them to face difficult times with a calm and steadfast attitude and a spirit of unity. Although the task to be undertaken will be very arduous, the days ahead may be bleak, and the war will not be limited to the battlefield, but what we take for granted, we can only do it and obey God. If we all firmly adhere to this righteousness, prepare for any service or sacrifice, then we will surely be victorious with God's help. May God bless us." (Reuters, 4th)

Chongqing: Thirty-six Japanese aircraft in large formations attacked Chongqing again in batches on the evening of the 3rd. In the night with faint stars and moon, an aerial battle took place over the city of Chongqing. Chinese Air Force cooperated with anti-aircraft artillery to launch fierce attacks together, and finally defeated the invading Japanese aircraft, which fled in defeat. According to a report from the Air Defense Command here today, many batches of Japanese aircraft, numbering thirty or forty, flew upstream along the Yangtze River to attack Chongqing. The Chinese Air Defense forces had made full preparations. About an hour after the emergency alarm, nine Japanese aircraft in formation sneaked in from the north of Chongqing. Chinese searchlights immediately concentrated their beams on them, and the Chinese Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery also launched fierce attacks. The Japanese aircraft were extremely panicked and dared not engage in prolonged combat. When they flew over the city, they dropped bombs in the suburbs and fled. About an hour later, the second batch of Japanese aircraft in formation was divided into three small batches, each of nine aircraft, also intruding from the north of Chongqing. When they passed over the city, Chinese searchlights illuminated them with strong beams, and the Japanese aircraft could not hide. Chinese anti-aircraft artillery also exerted its power, firing shells. At this time, the Chinese Air Force also charged towards the Japanese aircraft formation. The Japanese aircraft returned fire, and sparks flew across the sky, creating a spectacular sight. The reporter personally witnessed the Japanese aircraft being hit and was overwhelmed by the power of the Chinese artillery fire. The formation was scattered, and several aircraft seemed to be heavily damaged. Two other aircraft had their wings shaking violently, and they seemed about to fall. The remaining aircraft hurriedly dropped bombs in the city and suburbs and fled eastward. An air battle thus came to an end. Looking up at the sky, the Milky Way was high and bright, and the stars and moon were clear. The city of Chongqing returned to silence. According to investigation, although the Japanese aircraft dropped some bombs, there was no major loss on the Chinese side. (4th dispatch)

Three other teams arrived at 2:30 a.m. The alarm was lifted at 3:20 a.m. Chinese aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery units exerted unprecedented power, searchlights shone everywhere, and aircraft took off to meet the enemy. Three fires broke out, two of which were quickly extinguished. The other one was further away from the city, and the fire brigade rushed to put it out. This attack was the longest in history. Due to the cooling weather, air raid defenses here have improved. In February of the past, due to the extreme heat, people who took refuge in air raid shelters often fainted due to the unbearable heat and polluted air. (Associated Press, 4th)

Chongqing: Thirty-six Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing in two batches this morning. The first batch of nine aircraft appeared in the sky over Chongqing at 1:30 a.m., dropping bombs in the western suburbs. The second batch of twenty-seven bombers, in groups of nine, appeared at 3:00 a.m., again targeting the western suburbs. However, the bombs landed closer to the city area. Chinese fighter planes took off to intercept them, and the mountain anti-aircraft artillery was also very active. A fierce air battle then erupted, rarely seen in Chongqing. Although the sky was dark, there were indeed a large number of Chinese aircraft in the air, and the sound of their machine guns was very clear. The battle was extremely fierce. Witnesses said that several Japanese aircraft must have been shot down. Several fires broke out in the western suburbs after the bombing, and fire trucks rushed to put them out. According to an official announcement by the Chinese side, two Japanese bombers were shot down. According to a foreigner watching the battle on a mountain, he saw Chinese fighter planes intercepting the Japanese aircraft, and two bombers were hit by anti-aircraft fire. He also saw two Japanese aircraft with thick black smoke billowing out, quickly leaving the formation, whereabouts unknown. A Reuters reporter went to the bombed area in the western suburbs of Chongqing today and found that although many bombs had fallen, the damage was minimal. A small factory and a middle school were hit by bombs. One bomb fell into an empty courtyard of a university, and all the window glass was shattered. (Reuters, 4th)

### Outbreak of European War: Wartime Scenery in Hong Kong; British Troops Transferred from Singapore to Hong Kong for Reinforcement; German Nationals Ordered to Leave Hong Kong

Hong Kong Correspondence: Due to the increasingly urgent European situation, should a war break out, Hong Kong would inevitably be drawn into the vortex. Therefore, the Hong Kong government is actively preparing for war. The following is a record of the latest developments:

Hong Kong Authorities Promulgate Emergency Powers Ordinance

The Emergency Powers Act passed by the British Parliament on August 17 applies to all British colonies. The effect of the Act is the same as the old wartime defense law. The Hong Kong authorities promulgated implementation measures on the afternoon of the 28th. Under the Act, the local authorities may enact any legislation as they deem necessary for the purpose of ensuring public safety, local defense, maintaining order, and facilitating the conduct of the war. The Hong Kong authorities may (1) inquire, interrogate, and punish any person who violates such legislation, and detain any person if such detention is necessary; (2) confiscate or control any property or goods on behalf of the King; (3) acquire property other than land on behalf of the King; (4) amend any legislation or suspend the enforcement of any legislation; (5) enter and search any premises. The conscription powers stipulated in the Emergency Powers Act do not apply to Hong Kong, but the Hong Kong Financial Secretary has great power to control the economy and finance. The Hong Kong authorities may also control shipping and aircraft. After the Hong Kong authorities announced that the Emergency Powers Act applied to Hong Kong, they enacted legislation to control shipping under the Act, restricting the sale and mortgage of British merchant ships registered in Hong Kong. Shares in British merchant ships are also subject to the ban on sale and mortgage. Any unauthorized sale or mortgage is illegal, and the government authorities may bring prosecution and declare the legal effect of such sale or mortgage.

Land and Sea Defenses are Greatly Strengthened

According to sources, the aircraft carrier "    ", submarines, destroyers, etc., which were recently transferred from Hong Kong to Singapore to participate in Singapore's military exercises, were urgently transferred back to Hong Kong for joint defense due to the sudden tightening of Hong Kong's military situation, and will arrive in Hong Kong in the shortest possible time. Many main battleships stationed in the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea will also be transferred to Singapore for reinforcement. A large number of air force personnel and squadrons have secretly arrived in Hong Kong recently, greatly increasing air defense capabilities. As for the army transferred from Singapore to Hong Kong, there will be more than 10,000 British and Indian troops, and some are already being deployed. The military authorities have not acknowledged the rumor that 10,000 army troops will be transferred from Singapore to Hong Kong for reinforcement. However, in addition to the Indian troops transferred from India to Singapore for reinforcement earlier this month, the Singapore garrison has greatly increased. The original proposal to send two brigades to Hong Kong has been temporarily suspended due to the slight relaxation of the situation.

Furthermore, it is reported that the military authorities have long planned for active air defense, and anti-aircraft artillery positions are hidden in key areas that are not easily detected. According to military observers, Hong Kong's anti-aircraft artillery adopts a circular formation line of 25 miles around, which can be interwoven into a dense network of fire. The Army Headquarters announced on the 24th that anti-aircraft artillery exercises would be held from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on the 25th, with the firing range marked with a "G". As for the naval authorities, they set up obstacles in the waters of Cape Collinson at the entrance of Hong Kong on the 24th. Obstacles were also set up at the water gate in the western harbor. According to naval authorities, after the Lei Yue Mun port on the eastern side of Hong Kong is sealed off, consideration will be given to deploying obstacles in the waters of the Kap Shui Mun port on the four sides of Hong Kong, and implementing the closure after Lei Yue Mun, so that Hong Kong's maritime defenses will be further strengthened in times of emergency. Furthermore, according to those returning to Hong Kong from Macau, when the ship arrived at Kap Shui Mun port, they saw a Hong Kong naval engineering vessel anchored near the entrance to the port, apparently laying mines.

Currently, the British warships anchored in the port include the British cruiser HMS Birmingham, five submarines, the destroyers HMS Scott, HMS Dauntless, HMS Scarab, the transport ships HMS Eridanus, HMS Resource, HMS Bustler, and the American cruiser USS Mindanao. The original more than 20 naval vessels stationed in Hong Kong have a strong force. Under the current tense situation, most of the ships have been ordered to patrol the port, so only a few British ships remain in the port. The scene of naval and land soldiers rushing around in Wan Chai a few days ago is no longer visible in recent days.

Compulsory Service Ordinance Also Promulgated and Implemented

In view of the tense situation and to protect the safety and order of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong authorities, in addition to deploying additional troops to guard the border areas, have also ordered the Hong Kong Volunteer Defense Corps to prepare for mobilization to assist the defense forces in guarding the area. Currently, all members of the naval and land volunteer corps are not allowed to take leave to be summoned and assigned to service at any time when necessary. After the Hong Kong Compulsory Service Ordinance was promulgated and implemented, the Physical Examination Committee and the Military Service Committee were established one after another. The work of the Physical Examination Committee has recently been completed, and eligible British nationals have also been registered. The work of the Military Service Committee must begin. According to official sources, the Military Service Committee decided to hold its first public meeting at the Legislative Council at 2:30 p.m. on the 28th. After the meeting, another closed-door meeting will be held to discuss all arrangements and the distribution of work. It is heard that after the committee decides on the work plan, it will speed up the process so that Hong Kong can have a large number of service personnel in times of emergency.

German Nationals Have Left Hong Kong, Portuguese Nationals Are Also Preparing to Evacuate

Since Hong Kong announced the recommendation for British women and children to evacuate, nationals of various countries have also left Hong Kong one after another. For a time, rumors were rampant, and the Chinese community in Hong Kong also evacuated to Macau. The German Consul in Hong Kong formally notified all German nationals remaining in Hong Kong to evacuate on the morning of the 24th. It is found that there are more than 200 German nationals in Hong Kong, and more than 100 have evacuated in the past week, mostly to Shanghai and the Philippines. Among the German nationals in Macau are Dr. Baker, a famous doctor, and Colonel Paul. The staff and their families of other trading companies and the German Consulate General continue to work as usual. Also, the Dutch Consul in Hong Kong has notified the Dutch nationals here to register at the consulate in order to be notified when necessary to leave the country. It is learned that there is currently a Dutch ship anchored in Hong Kong waters, waiting to transport the Dutch from the country. As for the American nationals, according to the American Consul General, American nationals in Hong Kong have not yet been ordered to evacuate. The rumor that the American authorities in Hong Kong have prepared to use the American postal ship "President Cleveland" to transport American nationals in Hong Kong to the Philippines has been denied by the person in charge of the American Consulate. The ship, after arriving in Hong Kong from Manila yesterday, still decided to proceed to Shanghai according to the original schedule. Furthermore, the Portuguese Consul General in Hong Kong also advised the Portuguese nationals remaining in Hong Kong to prepare to evacuate when necessary and to prepare the necessary documents such as passports. The Governor of Macau, Barbosa, yesterday notified the Portuguese Consul in Hong Kong that those who plan to take refuge in Macau must first send a list of their names, ages, and genders to the Portuguese Consul.

Crowds of People Withdraw Money from Banks Every Day

Due to the tense situation, there have been crowds of people withdrawing money from banks every day to prepare for emergencies. There are many Chinese withdrawing money, and many foreigners are withdrawing money or exchanging for American gold dollars. Up to the 25th, the total amount of US dollars exchanged by various banks and money changers reached a huge 1.3 million yuan. Those who came later were still flocking in, and the place was impenetrable. The supply of US dollars was so urgent that the price of US dollars was completely sold out on the morning of the 20th. Because there were no significant imports of US dollars, it all depended on those in Hong Kong who specialized in storing US dollars. (Therefore, the exchange rate soared. Yesterday afternoon, the American ship "President Cleveland" carried a large number of US dollars to Hong Kong, and it is believed that the supply of US dollars will be sufficient.) Furthermore, there was a run on banks. On the 15th and 16th, the number of people withdrawing money from HSBC was huge. The building was already full, and there were 300 people standing outside the door waiting. By the 28th, the situation of the run was not as crowded as before. The police authorities, in order to prevent gangsters from taking advantage of the opportunity to be active, still sent Chinese and Indian police to the bank to maintain order. Those withdrawing money must enter through the main door in the middle of the line, line up in the lobby of the bank in a row of four, and go to the savings department in order. There were only a few people withdrawing money from the current deposit department.

### Bandits Arise in Dinghai; Director Ding Righteously Eliminates Disciples

Dinghai Correspondence: After the fall of Dinghai County, rogues and local bullies in various townships colluded with the Japanese and robbed and plundered everywhere, and the people of the townships suffered unspeakably. Wealthy families in the countryside, such as the Gao Xie family, the Gan family, the Zhou Zhiye family, and the Wang Chunshui family in Baiquan, were all robbed. Those who took refuge in the city from the countryside and had some savings were also coveted by these people, and they often openly pretended to be guerrillas to the various townships and demanded that the townships provide military pay. If they did not, they would rob and plunder. The people of the townships were all dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Recently, there was a rogue nicknamed Xiaojintuan who looted the homes of the people in the countryside, and the people of the townships could not bear it. They went together to a certain township to file a complaint with Ding Songsheng, the Chief of Staff of the County. Ding was greatly angered when he heard that he was responsible for maintaining the security of the four townships. Therefore, even though he had a teacher-student relationship with Xiaojintuan, he immediately ordered his staff to capture Xiaojintuan, tried him in court, and when the evidence of the crime was solid, he personally drew his gun and shot him to death to show the consequences. For a time, the people's hearts were greatly pleased.

Education News

### National Chongqing Merchant Marine Academy to be Established Soon; Preparations are Ready, Enrollment will Begin Soon; Three Departments to be Established: Navigation, Marine Engineering, and Shipbuilding

(Special Chongqing Dispatch) China's shipping industry has always been backward, and there is also a lack of talents in marine technology. Before the war, the Wusong Merchant Marine College was the only place in the country to train such specialized talents. The school was founded at the end of the Qing Dynasty. After the establishment of the new government in the first year of the Republic of China, it continued to run. Later, due to lack of funding, it was suspended in the fourth year of the Republic of China. After the alumni ran around planning, and with the perseverance of the Ministry of Communications, it was able to resume in the autumn of the 18th year of the Republic of China. It had two departments: Navigation and Marine Engineering. Graduates before and after numbered seven classes, more than 400 people. They all served in various maritime administrative agencies and served as navigators and marine engineers on Chinese and foreign merchant ships. The results were excellent and received good reputation. Since the August 13th Anti-Japanese War, the school was forced to suspend again due to the environment. The Ministry of Education, considering the vastness of China's shipping and the importance of marine education, based on the suggestions of the Education Committee of the Supreme National Defense Council, discussed with the Ministry of Communications, hired experts, and actively prepared to establish the National Chongqing Merchant Marine College. In addition to continuing to run the Navigation and Marine Engineering departments of the former Wusong Merchant Marine College, a Shipbuilding department was added to meet the needs. The school year limit for the Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering departments was changed to three years of academic study and one year of practical training, while the Navigation department was two years of academic study and two years of practical training. During the winter and summer vacations, students in each department should also go to designated shipyards for practical training. The school site has been surveyed, and the school building is being planned and built. Before the school building is completed, a giant Yangtze River wheel will be rented from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for temporary use to start school. All equipment such as instruments and books will be transferred from the former Wusong Merchant Marine College for application. It is heard that the school is now ready and will soon announce enrollment. (August 27th)

### Outbreak of European War: Difficult for Students Studying in the UK to Go Abroad

Scheduled Ships have been Requisitioned

The Board of Trustees for the British Boxer Indemnity Fund selected the seventh class of publicly funded students to study in the UK this year. A total of 24 qualified students in various fields such as physics were admitted. They were originally scheduled to gather in Hong Kong on the 16th of this month to collect their passports and clothing expenses and take the scheduled British ship to the UK. Unfortunately, the European war broke out in recent days, and military transportation was busy. The ship was requisitioned by a British military authority, and the issue of students studying in the UK arose again. It was necessary to postpone it appropriately. However, according to the reporter's inquiries with British shipping companies, it may not be easy for anyone to take foreign merchant ships abroad at present. Therefore, it is expected that it will be difficult for the publicly funded students studying in the UK this time to travel abroad in the short term.

### More than Sixty Free Night Schools for Refugee Children

Refugee Association is Also Planning to Establish

It is heard that the remaining schools have also decided to start school at the end of this month.

Furthermore, it is reported that the Refugee Association's education division, in order to cultivate refugee production skills, will plan to establish more than three production skills training classes and has decided to include automobile driving, machine bed tongs, sewing industry and other training classes. It is now waiting for the education division to finalize the plan, which will then be passed by the general assembly before starting to run it. It is heard that it can be implemented in October.

Prepare to Return Home for Military Service

Shipping Suspended, Postal Service Still Maintained

Currencies of All Countries Trend Lower Yesterday

German Tennis Association Destroyed by British Soldiers

The European war, due to Germany's refusal to respond on the evening of the 3rd, ultimately led to Britain and France declaring war on Germany. The European situation, which has been closely watched by people in Shanghai in recent days, is about to repeat the mistakes of the First World War 25 years ago, and its prelude was unveiled on the 3rd. The British residents in Shanghai were inspired after listening to the British King's speech yesterday morning and are quietly waiting to serve their country. The French and Polish residents are already preparing to return home for military service and are registering with their consulates. The French residents have complied with the general mobilization order and completed the mobilization procedures yesterday. As for the Chinese and foreign financial circles in Shanghai, they were affected by the news of the war. After the market opened yesterday morning, the situation became even more turbulent. Gold continued to plummet, foreign exchange continued to ease, and the Hong Kong dollar, British pound, and US dollar were all affected by the current situation and showed a soft trend. Due to shipping relations, the cargo transportation of importers and exporters in Shanghai is almost at a standstill. The situation is recorded in detail as follows:

The British Embassy in China, under the order of the government, issued a notice to British merchants yesterday, prohibiting trade and any commercial relations with enemy (i.e., German) merchants. This notice contains a warning and is of the same nature as the announcement issued by the British Ministry of Commerce in London yesterday.

British, French, and Polish Residents
Are All Ready and Waiting for Orders

British and French Residents
Enthusiastically Enlist

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that the French Consulate opened its doors at 7:00 am this morning (the 4th), and French residents went to register for enlistment due to general mobilization. Part of the French reserve troops have gathered in the French barracks for preliminary instructions. British residents are also complying with the conscription law passed by the British government two months ago and are enlisting with the British Consulate General.

According to the "Continental Daily News," the general mobilization of France was completed in Shanghai yesterday. French residents in Shanghai aged 20 to 49 registered with the French Consulate General yesterday morning to serve in the military. Part of the French reserve troops who have been called up will gather in the French barracks this morning (the 4th).

Polish Residents Await Orders
To Return Home to Fight

The new powder keg in Europe has exploded, and Poland has ultimately been invaded. The residents of various countries in Shanghai are deeply concerned about this. The actions of the Polish Minister to China and Consul General in Shanghai are receiving widespread attention. The Polish Legation is located at 83 Avenue Pichon in the French Concession, surrounded by lush trees. According to Consul General Bohomolski, Warsaw has been bombed, and the god of war has descended. There are about 400 Polish residents in Shanghai, many of whom have military status. Although they have not yet received any new orders from their government to return home, they are determined to return to the front lines as soon as the order arrives after hearing the news of their homeland's invasion. In addition, Polish Minister Weidenthal and his wife were ordered to take up new diplomatic positions in their country in late August. Minister Weidenthal and his wife boarded the Japanese Empress of the Changxing Company yesterday to prepare to leave Shanghai, but the ship had not yet left the port as of last night. His new ministerial position has been filled by Mr. Bades, appointed by the Polish government. Before Mr. Bades arrives, the Polish Consul General in Shanghai will temporarily take over the position.

Jewish Refugees
Petition to Serve

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that the number of German Jewish refugees who have applied to the British and French consulates in Shanghai to serve in the British and French armies is equal to the number of British and French residents who have registered. It is reported that a representative of the immigrants has applied to the British Consulate in Shanghai to form a Jewish legion as part of the British army. Although consulate officials cannot formally accept the application, they have reportedly recorded the names and addresses of the applicants and will notify them within a certain period.

British Residents in Shanghai Listen to
The King's Speech

Since British Prime Minister Chamberlain broadcast the government's decision to declare war on Germany to the people nationwide via wireless radio on the morning of the 3rd, people in both the East and West Hemispheres have been greatly shocked. The Second World War is being replayed today, and everyone is gripped by a sense of unease. All British residents in Shanghai are clearly more concerned about this. They intently listened to King George VI's broadcast speech to the nation from the palace via radio at 1:00 am yesterday morning. They were very inspired and expressed their determination to uphold all the points mentioned by the King and are quietly awaiting all the measures taken by the embassy and consulate regarding British residents fulfilling their responsibilities to the country. The British residents in Shanghai are sincerely concerned about their homeland and are worthy of respect.

Major General Mole
Hastily Returns to Shanghai

Major General Mole of the British Shanghai Garrison, the West Yorkshire Regiment, had just gone to South China a few days ago to discuss military affairs. Due to the outbreak of the European war, he took the Japanese Empress of the Changxing Company on the afternoon of the 1st to quickly respond to everything.

British and French Soldiers
Sing Military Songs

According to the "Continental Daily News," although German residents in Shanghai appear calm, they are shocked to hear that their country is at war with Britain and France. British residents are expressing joy at the culmination of the crisis. They are clearly welcoming the government's policy to some extent, as some British residents fear that Chamberlain may make further concessions to Germany. British soldiers, American sailors, and some French soldiers could be seen on Rue Chu Pao San singing "God Save the King," "Auld Lang Syne," "La Marseillaise," and military songs. Although the foreign residents are quite shaken, the concessions are as peaceful as ever.

Yesterday Morning's Situation Was
Uneasy and Unstable

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that the situation this morning (the 4th) was uneasy and unstable after Shanghai received the news that Britain, France, and Poland had declared war on Germany. Only the situation during the fierce Shanghai battle of the previous year could be compared to it. British passenger ships docked in Shanghai have been ordered to remain in port pending instructions from the British Navy. The commercial centers of the city have become abnormal, as British and French residents in foreign commercial firms are busy at the consulates deciding on their duties in the war situation. However, German business offices are mostly operating as usual, with only a few smaller exceptions. The German-Chinese Bank is busy dealing with a large number of withdrawals or account inquiries.

There Are No
Preparedness Plans in the Concessions

The "Continental Daily News" reported that foreign residents in Shanghai were concerned and sorrowful when they received the news yesterday (the 3rd) that Britain and France had declared war on Germany. The outbreak of war on the European front was not entirely unexpected, and the flow of war reports arriving in Shanghai via telegraph and radio has somewhat reduced the anxiety that has existed here for many days. Reporters interviewed officials of the Public Concession and the French Concession and learned that although the war has begun, no special preparedness plans have been adopted in the two concessions. According to a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, it is currently considered unnecessary to implement such a plan, nor is it intended to implement it in the future.

British Soldiers Destroy
German Association

The "Shanghai Times" reported that at 10:00 pm last night (the 3rd), several British soldiers broke into the German Tennis Association in the Racecourse and overturned tables and chairs, destroying it. The British soldiers came from the barracks next to the Racecourse Building. It is reported that these people have been paying special attention to the swastika flag hanging on the German Tennis Association during the tense situation this past week. Last night, after the British government announced a state of war, the British soldiers entered the association and destroyed it to vent their anger. No one was injured except for some slight damage to the association. At that time, there were no Germans inside. The chairman of the association and other German residents were at the German Association on Haig Road. After hearing the report, they went to the Racecourse. By the time they arrived, the disturbance had passed. British military police rushed to the scene to suppress the disturbance and arrested two British soldiers, reportedly the leaders of the incident, who will be punished by a military court. The police department then sent officers to protect the German Tennis Association.

All Shipping Suspended
Europe-Asia Postal Service Still Maintained

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that British ships on the Chinese coast have been ordered to immediately sail to the nearest port, and all shipping has been temporarily suspended. This measure was arranged before the outbreak of war. British ships will remain at various ports pending a decision from the British Navy on future actions. The Japanese Empress of the Changxing Company, the Tillesia of the Blue Funnel Line, and several other coastal ships originally scheduled to leave port tonight (the 4th) have been suspended due to this order. Foreign residents in Shanghai who are going on vacation elsewhere may have the opportunity to return to Shanghai when wartime shipping arrangements are implemented.

British Ships Concentrated
in Nearby Ports

After the outbreak of the European war, commercial ships of all related countries are under the command of their national navies. British shipping companies in Shanghai have received the above orders and are listening to naval commands. Yesterday, the Shanghai Taikoo Shipping Company telegraphed its ships, ordering them to stop at their current locations starting today and await orders. Ships sailing at sea must immediately sail to the nearest port to dock (for example, those sailing on the South China line near Xiamen should sail to Xiamen, and those near Shanghai should sail back to Shanghai, as should those sailing in Northern China) to await orders. Therefore, the "Shuntian" of the Taikoo Company, which was supposed to sail on the Northern China line yesterday, and the "Qiongzhou," which was scheduled to leave for Hong Kong and Singapore this afternoon, have been ordered to suspend their voyages. The cargo of the "Shuntian" has already been loaded, so it is still planned to depart today and is currently seeking instructions. The China Navigation Company, managed by the British Jardine Matheson, has also received the above orders. However, the "Yisheng," which is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong and Haiphong today, is reportedly still departing according to schedule. The "Tonghe," which sails on the Northern China line, returned to Shanghai yesterday, and its scheduled departure this morning has also been suspended. Although the ships of the two companies have not been ordered to concentrate in Hong Kong, all subsequent actions must be subject to naval command, so the schedule cannot be determined. Jardine Matheson has telegraphed its ships in various parts of Northern China, ordering them to return to Shanghai, as have the postal ships of the British Steam Navigation Company. As for the "Blue Funnel," "Xiangyang," "Baohe," and other British shipping companies, all will suspend voyages. The "Japanese Empress" postal ship of Changxing Company came to Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday afternoon and was scheduled to weigh anchor at 11:00 am yesterday to return to Vancouver. While weighing anchor, it suddenly received an order from the British naval authorities not to move until there was a departure order. Therefore, the ship is still docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou awaiting orders.

American Ships Consider
Increasing Flights

With the outbreak of the European war, all commercial ships of the belligerent countries of Britain, France, Germany, etc., operating in the Far East have received orders from their governments to return to their countries or concentrate to await orders. The number of commercial ships operating has suddenly decreased, and the Far East route will clearly decline. According to confirmed information obtained by reporters from various sources, the American President Lines and other companies are now considering this matter and will decide to increase the number of Far East flights at any time depending on the extent of the development of the European situation. It is also reported that Dutch commercial ships will also make a decision to increase the number of Far East flights.

French Postal Ships Ordered
to Return to Annam

The Qinlabao of the postal ship company was originally planned to stay in Saigon, but was later ordered by the head office to come to Shanghai. It departed from Hong Kong on the 1st of this month and was suddenly ordered to return to Annam while en route to Shanghai. The ship immediately turned around and returned to Saigon to stay and await orders. In addition, according to the company, the company's irregular ship "Yangtze" will still come to Shanghai as usual this morning.

An Italian Postal Ship
Suspends Voyages in Shanghai

The Rulianhai of the Italian postal ship company's Europe-Asia route came to Shanghai on the 28th of last month and was originally scheduled to return to Venice on the 30th. Due to the deterioration of the European situation, it has suspended voyages in Shanghai and is now moored at the Texaco Wharf. Italy is currently a neutral country, so the company asked the embassy yesterday whether it was feasible to return the ship to its country, but it did not receive a definite answer. Other ships flying the Italian flag are also watching.

German Ships Suspend Voyages,
Limited to Leaving the Coast

The ships of the German-owned Hengbao Company have stopped operating in the Far East. The postal ship "Xianghuosituo" of the North German Company is currently staying in Kobe, Japan, and it is feared that it will be difficult to come to Shanghai for the time being. In addition, the "Moufu," "Haifu," and "Far East" ships of the Lihe Foreign Company, which operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, have been notified by the German Consulate that they must not leave the coast by three nautical miles. Therefore, the three ships are now in Zhenhai Port, and the goods have not yet been completely unloaded. Whether they can return to Shanghai after unloading is another question. The "Kaisideng," "Lisha," "Haiyi," "Haikang," and "Luan," etc., ships of the German-owned Kaisideng, Lisha, Haiyi, and Haikang companies, which operate on the Yangtze River, can operate within three nautical miles of the river ports, so they are still operating as usual.

Neutral Country Ships
Sail as Usual

However, ships of neutral countries, such as Norway, Greece, and the Netherlands, can still sail. The Zhishadani of the Java Company arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 7th, passing through Hong Kong and various parts of Southeast Asia before returning to Batavia. The Greek ship "Haili," managed by Qiachang Shenxing at 12 Avenue Edward VII, is scheduled to sail directly to Hong Kong tomorrow (the 6th), as it can guarantee the safe transport of passengers and cargo to Hong Kong. Also, because Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships have suspended voyages, it will be determined this morning whether the British ship "Venimale," fully loaded with cargo, can go to Hong Kong today.

Europe-Asia Postal Service
Maintained as Much as Possible

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday that the bureau is doing its best to facilitate postal transport within its capabilities in order to facilitate the delivery of letters to foreign residents in China. As for parcels and remittances, they will continue to be accepted and sent as usual unless instructed otherwise by the head office. Therefore, the mail is very crowded. However, in fact, remittances to Europe have gradually decreased.

German and Italian Residents Quietly Await Developments, Industries in Shanghai Are Affected

German Residents Register,
Companies Change Their Names

The European war situation is developing rapidly, and the movements of German residents in Shanghai are particularly noteworthy. According to general opinion, German residents may not leave Shanghai to return to their country. In recent days, the number of German residents has increased due to the withdrawal of a small number of German residents from Hong Kong to Shanghai. It is rumored that German residents in Shanghai are only closely watching the development of the situation, and the German Consulate has not received an order from the government to call up reserve personnel of the army, navy, and air force for service. However, according to reliable information obtained by reporters, German residents in Shanghai went to the German Business Club on Jiangxi Road and Jiujiang Road yesterday morning to start registering in preparation for emergencies. It is reported that German business firms are now trying to change their signs, trying to change them to neutral country names. Some well-known German business firms in Shanghai have changed their names one after another.

Italian Embassy
Closed All Day

Personnel of the Italian Embassy in Shanghai have been leaving Shanghai for other places one after another. The Italian Embassy was closed all day yesterday. It is reported that more than a dozen military attachés and other officials have taken a ship to Japan. Whether they are transferring to Japan to return to their country is not yet known. Italian residents in Shanghai do not currently show signs of evacuation, as Italian postal ship companies can only refund tickets and not sell them.

Outbreak of European War
Dynamics of Various Industries

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency went to various industry markets in Shanghai yesterday morning to investigate the impact of the European war on various industries: (1) Most of the Western pigments come from Germany, followed by Britain, the United States, and other countries. Defu Foreign Company of Germany, Hengxin Foreign Company of the United States, and Bonemen Foreign Company of Britain all operate the transportation of pigments from their respective countries to Shanghai for sale. Due to the outbreak of the European war, the source has been interrupted. However, the pigment companies have sufficient inventory, but the current selling price of pigments has increased by 40% to 50% due to hoarders' reluctance to sell. (2) Hardware industries, such as hinges and door locks, mostly rely on foreign countries. Due to the previous sharp contraction of the black market foreign exchange, the selling price once increased. Due to the current tense European situation, all goods sold cannot be transported to Shanghai. It is reported that the industry association has scheduled a pricing committee meeting on the 10th of this month to discuss solutions. The entire construction industry in Shanghai has been greatly affected. (3) After the disappearance of domestic coal from the coal industry market, foreign coal took the opportunity to be sold in Shanghai. With the outbreak of the European war, foreign coal will inevitably decrease in Shanghai, giving Japanese coal the opportunity to be sold in Shanghai. Other industries, such as cosmetics raw materials, machinery dyeing and weaving, yarn mills, and cotton, are currently able to maintain their original state, but it is difficult to predict what will happen in the future.

Foreign Exchange Hits Unprecedented Low, Gold Prices Plunge Again

Foreign Exchange Eases Again, Legal Tender Rises

The Shanghai foreign exchange black market has been affected by the European war, and speculators have flocked to it, creating an unprecedented easing. Yesterday morning, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation quoted British exchange at 4 and a half points long, and American exchange at 7 yuan and 75 cents long. Other exchanges such as French, German, Hong Kong, and Japanese also all increased. The actual market price was 8 and a half yuan for American exchange and 4 and 75 cents for British exchange. The legal foreign exchange of the Central Bank remained stable and unchanged. The Foreign Exchange Examination Committee normally supplied foreign exchange for the import of necessities in accordance with the Central Exchange listing as much as possible. The current easing of the foreign exchange black market has instead increased the value of legal tender, and China's finances have become increasingly stable.

Securities Gray Market Trends Slightly More Stable

Due to the impact of the European war on the securities gray market, the market was panicked, leading to a sharp drop in prices. After the market opened yesterday morning, the price of the Unified Public Bonds tended to be slightly more stable because the value of China's legal tender increased and the government maintained its creditworthiness as always. The closing prices are recorded below: A Morning 50 yuan and 8 cents, Afternoon 51 yuan and 1 cent and 5 cents; B Morning 45 yuan and 1 cent, Afternoon 45 yuan and 2 cents; C Morning 42 yuan and 9 cents, No transaction in the afternoon; D Morning 42 yuan, Afternoon 43 yuan and 2 cents; E Morning 42 yuan and 3 cents, Afternoon 42 yuan and 9 cents

Gold Prices Continue to Plunge

After the gold gray market opened yesterday morning, the market was chaotic and panicked, partly because the black market foreign exchange was easing due to the European war, and partly because the government had issued a ban on the sale and purchase of gold. Gold prices plunged again: (1) The morning opening price was 3,100 yuan, the highest was 3,200 yuan, the lowest was 3,000 yuan, and the closing price was 3,090 yuan. (2) The afternoon opening price was 3,090 yuan, the highest was 3,100 yuan, the lowest was 3,050 yuan, and the closing price was 3,070 yuan. As for the listed prices of silverware shops, the morning price was 340 yuan, which was then reduced to 315 yuan.

Foreign Currencies Plummet, French and German Currencies Have No Market

The Tongdui Industry Association announced yesterday's inter-industry market prices: (1) British gold pound, buy 82 yuan, sell 86 yuan; (2) Gold note, buy 41 yuan and 5 cents, sell 42 yuan and 5 cents; (3) American gold pound, buy 84 yuan, sell 88 yuan; (4) American gold note, buy 12 yuan and 1 cent, sell 12 yuan and 3 cents; (5) Hong Kong note, buy 2 yuan and 5 cents, sell 2 yuan and 7 cents; (6) Canadian note, buy 10 yuan and 8 cents, sell 11 yuan and 1 cent. As for French franc notes and German gold notes, there were no transactions yesterday, so there was no market. In addition, the prices of British gold pounds and Hong Kong notes have fallen sharply compared to the previous.

China's Finances Remain Stable

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited Secretary-General Lin of the Banking Association yesterday. According to him, after the outbreak of the European war, the transportation of British, French, German, and other foreign goods to China was interrupted, and most hoarders were unwilling to sell, resulting in European goods in the Chinese market becoming stubbornly expensive, while the export of domestic goods was inevitably slightly affected by Britain, France, Germany, and other countries. However, fortunately, the export of goods to the United States and other countries was not obstructed. While European goods are stubbornly expensive, it is an opportunity for the rise of domestic goods. All Chinese people should replace imported goods with domestic goods. China's finances remain stable as always. The easing of the Shanghai foreign exchange black market has increased the value of legal tender, which is beneficial to China. In addition, reporters learned from the banking community that there was no word that the Ministry of Finance had instructed Shanghai to instruct finance.

The Commercial Press Operates as Usual

The staff of the Henan Road distribution office and the Jing'an Temple Xiafei Road branches of the Commercial Press have been on strike since September 1st, making it difficult for schools to purchase textbooks. It is now known that the library and the two branches operated as usual starting at 1:00 pm yesterday, and the schools were extremely crowded to add books.

Principal of Girls' Middle School
Wu Zhiqian Assassinated

Youth Enters School Under the Pretense of Registering

Wu Dies of Four Gunshot Wounds

Another extremely noteworthy assassination case occurred on Dagu Road in the Public Concession at around 8:40 am yesterday morning. The victim was a man of letters, Wu Zhiqian, the founder and principal of the Shanghai Girls' Middle School at 451 Dagu Road. The perpetrators were four men dressed in different Western clothing, but only one person acted when committing the crime, firing five or six shots in a row. Wu was caught off guard and was hit. As a result, the perpetrators escaped leisurely. Wu was sent to the hospital by the police but died of his injuries. The details are as follows:

Hit by Four Bullets

At 8:45 am yesterday morning, a young man dressed in a blue-gray suit suddenly came to the Girls' Middle School and entered the school under the pretense of registering. At the same time, there were three accomplices dressed in white silk shirts and pants guarding the school gate. When the young man walked to the entrance of the teaching rest area, he bumped into Wu and immediately fired at Wu, firing five or six shots in a row. Wu was hit by four bullets, two in the shoulder, one in the chest, and one in the abdomen, and immediately fell to the ground bleeding, unconscious. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the perpetrators leisurely left the school with their weapons and fled in different directions with the guards. When the shots were fired, the students in the school were extremely panicked and fled one after another, and the order was immediately chaotic.

Resuscitation Ineffective

After the incident, the Chengdu Road Patrol Room received a report and sent Chinese and Western detectives to the scene. The shooter had disappeared. The ambulance was immediately called to send Wu to the Shanghai Sanitarium and Health Hospital at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road for treatment. Due to injuries to vital parts, he died around 11:00 am. The investigation into the reason for the interrogation is still underway by the promotion department.

School Establishment Process

Wu Zhiqian is from Nantong and is 36 years old this year. He studied in Italy in his early years and entered the University of Rome. The Shanghai Girls' Middle School was founded by Wu before he went abroad. Its original location was at Xieqiao in Nanshi. After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, due to environmental reasons, it was moved to its current new location at 451 Dagu Road. Due to proper management, it has an outstanding reputation and has 700 to 800 students. In the spring of last year, Wu, in view of the destruction of schools in the inland and universities in the suburbs by the war, co-founded Shanghai Women's University to meet social needs, but the application procedures have not yet been completed. Wu himself and his family live in the school. Wu must go to the office to work at around 8:00 to 9:00 every morning and has never been late, which has become a habit.

Slaughter Stops, Meat Shops Close

After the fresh meat industry in the two concessions protested against the price increase of the "Livestock Market" and stopped trading yesterday, the slaughterhouse of the French Concession Engineering Bureau, the Suxi Slaughter Company, and the Xininghai Slaughter Company all stopped slaughtering pigs from the day before yesterday. Therefore, more than 2,000 fresh meat shops and stalls in the city had no fresh meat for sale yesterday, only the refrigerated goods that had not been sold before were on the market. Although the meat shops have been forced to close in order to maintain order in the concessions, they are not closed.

Request to Restore
Weighing by the Catty Method

At 10:00 am yesterday morning, the fresh meat industry sent six representatives (two each from the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Hongkou District) to Hongkou to contact the "Livestock Market" to request (1) the abolition of the auction system and the restoration of the original weighing method by the catty, and (2) the reduction of the selling price to maintain the meat supply in Shanghai. The manager of the "Market," Song Yuan, said that the auction system was modeled after the domestic method in Japan, and he agreed to submit a request to the "Asia Development Board" to abolish it. At the same time, he advised the meat industry to resume business immediately and scheduled the representatives to go to the Asia Development Board for a request on a regular basis.

Rice Market Stirred Up by Rumors,
Rice Prices Rebound Yesterday

The Foreign Rice Ordered Was Transported to Shanghai by the Norwegian Ship Haida

In the Future, It Will Still Be Loaded by Ships from Third Countries

After the rice market opened yesterday, the market was unusually chaotic, and speculators took the opportunity to spread rumors that although the first batch of 18,000 bags of foreign rice was on its way to Shanghai, it was loaded on a German ship. Now that the European war has broken out, large ships must be used for military transport, so the arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai will be postponed indefinitely. As a result, rice prices were firm when the market opened in the morning. By the time the market stabilized in the afternoon, the price had returned a small amount, but the average increase in all goods throughout the day still reached three yuan (details can be found in the economic news column of this newspaper).

Yesterday's Rice Arrivals
Reached 5,000 Piculs

Yesterday, a total of nine rice ships arrived in Shanghai, totaling 1,140 piculs, and the hoarders and dealers listed 2,546 bags, totaling 4,700 piculs. It is reported that 4,000 piculs of Taizhou rice were loaded and arrived in port yesterday, but the market is seeking 10.

First Batch of Tribute Rice
Transported to Shanghai Without Obstruction

A reporter from the Daguang News Agency, in view of the rumor in the rice market yesterday that the outbreak of the European war would make it impossible to transport the tribute rice to Shanghai, so some unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to raise prices, visited Mr. Yanfang to clarify the truth about the shipment of foreign rice. According to him, the 18,000 bags of tribute rice ordered in the first batch were loaded on the Norwegian commercial ship Haida of Hualun Zhixing in Saigon on the 29th of last month to be transported to Shanghai. Norway is a neutral country and is not affected by the European war. It has been reported that the shipowner telegraphed that the ship needed to be delayed until the 7th or 8th of this month due to loading coal in the middle. At that time, 10,000 bags were ordered by the Refugee Relief Association, and the remaining 8,000 bags would be processed at an equal price. As for the foreign rice ordered by various industries, the decision would continue to be carried out, and the ships from third countries would be loaded and transported. It was also learned that the number of people who continued to register at the Accountants Association yesterday was 50 bags for the American Kang Liquor Store and 50 bags for the Guangda Thermos Factory, for a total of 4,286 bags before. However, with the rice price rebounding in recent days, the requests for prices from various industries have been enthusiastic.

Zhu Xinggong's Coffin
Was Buried Yesterday

Sorrowed by All Parties

Telegrams of Condolences Arrived in Shanghai for Days

The coffin of Zhu Xinggong, the deputy editor of the supplements to the Greater American Evening Post, was moved from the Universal Funeral Home to the Hongqiao Cemetery at 9:45 am yesterday and buried at the E-hole there at 10:00 am. In addition to family members, many close friends went to the funeral. All parties mourned deeply for Zhu's service in the news industry, even to the point of sacrificing his life. Telegrams of condolences arrived in Shanghai for days. Yesterday, a certain gentleman in the Shanghai business community contacted the Great American Evening Post, willing to assume all primary school tuition fees for Zhu Zi Xiyong. Another gentleman, wishing to obtain a portrait of Zhu, specially presented the family with 400 yuan for funeral expenses.

Small Denomination Stamps
Tolerantly Accepted

Washing and Reusing
Should Be Investigated and Prosecuted

The Shanghai Postal Administration has ordered postal workers at various branches to tolerate the acceptance of small denomination stamps that are not too damaged on letters in order to take care of the convenience of foreign residents in China when delivering letters. According to Article 9 of the Postal Law, the procedures for damaged stamps should be handled. The Bureau's General Order No. 1204 was issued for compliance. It is now approved by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce that there are many stamps in the market for temporary use as change. In addition to the reply, it is hereby ordered to know that in the current situation, if small denomination stamps that are not too damaged and have not been washed and reused are affixed to letters, they may be accepted leniently. However, if any of the above-mentioned stamps are suspected of being washed and reused, they should be reported immediately for verification and handling. This order, Director Zha Pei Lin,

The Fake "Livestock Market" Increases Prices
The Fresh Meat Industry Implements a Shutdown Yesterday

Only Refrigerated Goods Are Available in Fresh Meat Shops and Stalls

The Meat Industry Demands the Abolition of the Auction System

The entire fresh meat industry in the Public Concession and the French Concession protested against the price increase of the fake "Livestock Market" and was forced to shut down yesterday morning. Yesterday morning, the representatives sent to contact the "Market" were unsuccessful and will request the fake "Asia Development Board." The details are recorded as follows.

Yih Ho Yarn Factory
Labor Dispute Resolved

Afraid of Being Used by Traitors
Reluctantly Accept Conditions

After the British-owned Yih Ho Yarn Factory dismissed more than 150 male and female workers in the new cloth weaving workshop of the Second Factory on the evening of the 30th of last month, the workers were deeply afraid of falling into the trap of traitors and reluctantly accepted the factory's settlement conditions yesterday. The content is as follows: (1) The workers who are dismissed will go to the factory every day to sign and receive a subsidy of three cents. (2) After the new workshop is opened, they can still resume work. It is said that the "Dakun Association" was unable to deal with this sudden settlement of the labor dispute.

The Sand and Gravel Industry
Suffers Another Misfortune

More Than a Dozen Sand Ships Sink
Sand and Gravel Arriving in Shanghai Is Detained Again

Since the yellow sand was controlled by the "Jiangnan Industrial Company," the sand and gravel industry and boat workers have been at a standstill for two months. A few days ago, the "Jiangnan Company" distributed procurement certificates to various boat owners and asked them to go to Sijiao Island and other places to collect and transport sand, totaling more than 60. The boat owners have been out of business for a long time and are forced to make a living. They exported for loading a few days ago, just in time for a hurricane. After the sand collecting boats were hit, more than a dozen of them were sunk. More than 20

The second session of the Hong Yi Cup Volleyball League, organized by Hong Yi Middle School at the intersection of Jing An Temple Road and Gordon Road, has now reached its final stage. The Group A match between Fang Kang and Fu Dan is scheduled for 9:15 tonight at the school's court to determine the championship. Fang Kang, with its three musketeers Zheng Yi-quan, Mai Bing-yao, and Guo Bing-kun, won the championship of the youth tournament. Its arrogance is high, and it believes that the championship of Shanghai is none other than itself. Fu Dan, however, has maintained the throne of Jiang Da for more than ten years. Its main player, Tan Yong-zhan, has been selected as a representative to the Far East Games. Skilled players such as Zhou Da-yun, Li Wen-jian, and Yuan Ze-jian are also still serving their alma mater. The lineup remains strong. The two sides are evenly matched, hence the saying "two difficulties on the sea." During the youth tournament final between the two teams, the stadium was completely full, and many people were turned away, showing the amazing attraction of the match. In the fierce battle, Fu Dan lost by a score of one to two, but the victory and defeat were only close in the last two points, so it is still too early to judge success or failure. In this Hong Yi Cup, Fang Kang has won five games out of five (with only one match against Pengbi remaining, which should not be a problem). Fu Dan has also won all six games. After the youth tournament, the two teams have once again reached a stalemate. Tonight, they will meet again in a narrow encounter, and Fu Dan will definitely go all out in the hope of avenging its defeat in the youth tournament. The battle between the dragon and the tiger will be more intense than the youth tournament final. Moreover, Da Yun is about to go to Yunnan, and his upcoming departure will surely attract people to watch. At that time, the Hong Yi stadium will be packed with people, and the scene will be unprecedented. In the same group, Hong Yi is expected to win against Lan Bai. In addition, there are three other matches: the women's match between Fu Dan and Xuan Lu, and two Group B matches. The competition will start at 5:30 PM. Tickets are four jiao. White complimentary tickets and player IDs will not be accepted.

### Hsu Cheng-wei Loses to Carson in a Hard-Fought Five-Set Match

Hsu Cheng-wei, the younger brother of Hsu Cheng-chi, has not been seen on the court since he came to Shanghai to study at Fu Dan last month. Yesterday evening, Hsu played against Carson, a veteran who has been playing for many years, in the first week of the delayed and undecided grass court senior singles match at the American Club. Hsu's style is very similar to that of his brother Cheng-chi. His serve is strong and sharp, his forehand and backhand are both good, and he seems to be better at long shots than short blocks. He fought hard for five sets, but in the final set, due to exhaustion and discouragement, and having just recovered from a recent illness, he suffered a narrow defeat of two to three. Carson won yesterday purely based on experience.

In the first week of the doubles match between Liang De-guang and Wang Wen-zheng against Pan Di-tuo and Ke Qi, Pan and Ke telegraphed Liang and Wang yesterday to announce their withdrawal, so Liang and Wang advanced to the second week without any effort.
