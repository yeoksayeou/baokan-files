(Hong Kong) The Chinese side has fully deployed military arrangements in the North River area and is now strengthening military operations in the West River and southern Guangdong to resist the Japanese army, adopting a large-scale encirclement strategy. Several divisions of the Guangdong army have been ordered to move to western Guangdong, also taking into account the southern route, commanded by two famous generals and under the overall command of Xia Wei. They are now arriving at their destinations one after another. Zhang Fakui also plans to convene a military conference at the end of the month with generals above the rank of army commander, including Wu Qiwai, Xia Wei, Yu Hanmou, Li Hanhun, Li Zhenqiu, Ye Zhao, Zhang Da, and Deng Longguang, to plan a counter-offensive.

However, the Chinese army has sufficient troop deployments and strong fortifications on all fronts, and if the Japanese dare to invade, they will certainly inflict heavy damage. According to Chinese sources, there are currently a total of 23 Japanese warships concentrated on Weizhou Island, opposite Beihai, including three aircraft carriers, five cruisers, and other destroyers and transport ships.

### A New Era in Southwest Transportation: Foreign Goods Arrive Directly in Kunming; Resistance Strength Will Increase from Now On

(Chongqing) According to a foreigner who recently traveled from Yangon to Kunming, it is now possible to travel by car from Yangon to Kunming via the new Burma Road. The cheapest way to transport goods into China is to transport them by water to Bhamo, a town in Burma 40 miles west of the Sino-British border, and then have them carried across the border by mules directly to Kunming. However, this method of transportation is not entirely suitable for all kinds of goods. Generally, merchants are very interested in this new road connecting Kunming and Yangon.

Editorial

### Spain and the Far East

A few days ago, the London Times correspondent in Tokyo made a comprehensive report on the Japanese reaction to the strong note from the United States, Britain, and France to Japan, respecting the Nine-Power Treaty. His words roughly stated: Japan will probably have to abandon some of its illusions; but with its many military victories in China, and in view of the actions of the omnipotent powers in Europe, it has not been without gains, and thus has something to aspire to. What the so-called "illusion that Japan is about to abandon" refers to, the original telegram did not detail; judging from the speeches made by Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arita in the Japanese parliament some time ago, this newspaper has criticized them as empty and superficial, with no new proposals; compared to the repeated expressions of determination by Japan before the note from the three countries, the persistence in its delusions can also be said to be a complete lack of new awareness; then to say that Japan has to abandon some kind of illusion is still not credible. This is further evidenced by recent information, which states that Japan is organizing a huge number of new troops in Taiyuan and Taiwan, giving them special training specifically for dealing with Chinese guerrilla warfare; and on the front lines of western Shanxi, western Hubei, and western Guangdong, after a long period of silence, the Japanese army has recently shown signs of preparing to launch another offensive; thus, looking at it, the three countries' diplomatic actions to deal with madness and aggression in the Far East will be no different from seeing a thief committing murder and arson in one's neighborhood, bullets flying and flames spreading, and demonstrating barehanded calisthenics. To say that this is overstating the case, the Spanish affair is a clear lesson.

The rise and fall of the Spanish Republican government and the National Army's forces directly affected Britain and France, as this newspaper's editorial yesterday discussed in detail. Even across the Atlantic, in the United States, an unusual threat was felt after the National Army's victory. The sentiments in the United States yesterday and the day before have revealed this without reservation. If the government forces' situation is deteriorating day by day, as it is now, then the "non-intervention" policy is weighing heavily on people's minds. So borders are closed, arms are embargoed, and a scorched-earth policy is adopted, waiting for the fire to spread. To say that the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States initially did not expect this is like seeing firewood but not a cartload, which is unbelievable. Not rescuing when rescue is needed, not rescuing when rescue is possible; now that there is a prospect of a rapid decline, how much longer can it be before it is too late to rescue! So they look at each other in dismay, discussing giving support, discussing lifting the embargo; clearly knowing that disaster is imminent, they are fearful that they will no longer be able to protect themselves alone, and haughtily say that they will definitely protect themselves. We have never heard of a strategy that allows the front lines to fall while only defending the door of the headquarters; but the policies of Britain, France, and the United States on the Spanish issue are like this strategy.

Are Britain, France, and the United States suddenly realizing the mistake of one-sided non-intervention? Are they terrified of the danger of close neighbors suffering the same fate, and supporting the Spanish Republican government? This cannot be foreseen. Even today, they are only using the lifting of the embargo as a way to aid Spain. Can they reverse the decline? It is difficult to predict. But a telegram from Berlin states that German newspapers believe that Spain's destiny has been decided! At the same time, what London and Paris are concerned about is Mussolini's promise to withdraw his troops after the victory and not station troops in the west or covet Spanish territory. The contrast between the two cannot help but make us shed tears of sympathy for Spain's "determined destiny"! Or perhaps we should not view it this way, as long as the countries of Britain, France, and the United States rise up to catch up, it is not difficult to reverse the situation. It is credible in theory, but probably impossible in practice. For supporting Spain now is the last opportunity, and it is also the worst situation; supporting it in the past would have been as easy as turning one's hand, but the opportunity has passed; supporting it now requires almost ten or a hundred times the strength of the past. Can those who sympathize with it bear this sacrifice and make this great vow? Because of this, we have nothing to pray for, only to pray that Mussolini will not keep his promise, to bless Britain, France, and the United States!

Regretting something that has already happened is the most lamentable. So we should take the Spanish issue as a warning and discuss the Far East. In the current situation in the Far East, there is only one dark shadow due to the Spanish affair; that is, as the Times correspondent said, Japan aspires to the fact that the omnipotent powers in Europe have not been without gains, and the possible misfortune of Spain is another gain for the omnipotent powers; will Japan not rejoice at this? Apart from this dark shadow, everything is bright. China has the advantage of time, terrain, and strategy; it has entered a favorable stage; and the morale and support of the people are being rekindled. Japan is exhausted, and is imposing an unprecedented budget of one hundred million yuan on the people; its troops are old and ineffective, its military morale is scattered, and it cannot advance or retreat. Internationally, sympathy for China has penetrated deep into the people, and hatred for Japan has reached a boiling point. Therefore, all circumstances are completely the opposite of the Spanish issue. In other words, restraining Japan now is taking advantage of the situation, like destroying rotten wood or pulling up weeds. Supporting China now is the best opportunity, and also the best situation. If this is not the case and we expect Japan to abandon its illusions, we can only expect the victory of China's resistance; but why should we let China bear the brunt of the responsibility for a long time!

### Imposing Economic Pressure by the Great Powers - Japan Deeply Alarmed - Hiranuma Declares He Has Countermeasures - The Eastern News Advocates Inviting British Cabinet Members to Visit Japan

(Tokyo) During yesterday's House of Representatives session, Prime Minister Hiranuma, in response to questions from Representative Yuya, firmly stated that Japan intends to implement an unswerving policy towards China and is prepared to counter the economic pressure exerted by the Great Powers with a plan of resistance.  The verbatim transcript of his response is as follows: The questioner asked whether Japan's policy toward Chinese affairs had changed since Konoe's declaration of December 22nd last year. I now especially announce that the declaration of December 22nd clarified Japan's unswerving policy. This policy has not changed or been revised because of that document. Japan must overcome all kinds of difficulties and implement its unswerving policy in any situation.  The questioner then asked whether the government feared the economic pressure exerted by third-party powers or whether the government would succumb to this pressure. I specifically announce that the government also has its own countermeasure plan to forcefully respond to the economic pressure from third-party powers.  I hope this situation never arises, but the government is determined to resolutely deal with such a possible situation. Regarding the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China, if a new government, namely the "Central Government of China," can be formed, the government intends to assist it and realize the objectives clarified in the December 22nd declaration.  Japan is prepared to relinquish extraterritorial rights in China. The government will proceed according to this policy, so that other foreign countries also relinquish their extraterritorial rights in China; this is a natural consequence. Hiranuma concluded by saying, "If a 'New Central Government of China' is formed, it is only natural for Japan to expand its assistance to this government." (Reuters, 24th)

(Tokyo) The close attention paid to the East Asian policies of Britain and the United States and the responses expressed in yesterday's Diet session can all be seen in this morning's newspapers. The Kokumin Shimbun anticipates that Foreign Minister Arita will invite British Prime Minister Chamberlain or Foreign Secretary Halifax to visit East Asia to gain a correct understanding of the current situation. The Miyako Shimbun stated that although Japan is now forced to resort to military force, it truly desires China to enjoy peace and prosperity. The countries guilty of invading China, namely Britain, the United States, and France, hope that they will eventually fully understand Japan's justice. The Kokumin Shimbun reviewed Chamberlain's flight to Munich, saying that Chamberlain or British Foreign Secretary Halifax's visit to East Asia would be very timely. Britain's supply of new loans to the Chiang Kai-shek government suggests a threatening policy toward Japan. Britain is clearly afraid that if the overall situation is allowed to continue as it is, Japan will ultimately control all of China. It should be understood that Japan's utmost resolve will not be shaken by the joint anti-Japanese action planned by Britain, France, and the United States. If British politicians are willing to travel to Japan, personally observe the reality of this part of the world, and have sincere discussions with Japanese leaders, their contribution to world pacifism will undoubtedly be significant.

### The Japanese Economy in Dire Straits - How to Raise Funds? - The Finance Minister's Answer Was Vague

(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese House of Representatives began its question-and-answer session on the 23rd. In addition to the questions from Constitutional Democratic Party member Toyota as reported yesterday, there were also questions from Seiyukai member Miyazawa. The main points were that reforming all government affairs, boosting morale, and establishing a wartime system are the urgent tasks of the new cabinet, but how to digest public bonds and revitalize foreign trade are prerequisites. Will the government compensate for the huge military expenditure in the past by increasing prices or taxes? What methods will be used to ensure the digestion of the huge amount of public bonds next year? Instead of restricting imports, how about revitalizing exports? What are the government's countermeasures? Finance Minister Ishiwata only replied that although the sale of public bonds has been hindered since October last year, it has gradually recovered this spring. Bank of Japan banknotes were issued to more than 2.85 billion yen at the end of the year, but this has now been reduced. He painted an optimistic picture of a bleak situation, while avoiding discussing the crucial points. Social Democratic Party leader Abe asked how the government intends to concentrate national strength for the so-called long-term construction. Hiranuma had no concrete plan to answer. Miura, a leader of the right-wing Toho Kai, asked why Arita's diplomacy was still compromise diplomacy and why the government did not adopt a proactive policy to deal with the "China Incident." Arita replied that there was an unswerving policy towards China, but there was no need to cause unnecessary friction with third countries. The first round of questioning in the House of Representatives thus came to an end. Judging from the questions from the various parties, their concerns about the future were clearly visible, while the responses from Hiranuma, Arita, and Ishiwata were still a set of clichés.

### The Japanese Military is Consuming Enormous Resources - Few Troops Available for Deployment at Home - Military Advocates Extending Military Service

(Tokyo) According to foreign sources, the Japanese government has no hope of ending military operations in China in the near future, but it feels it is very difficult to transfer new troops from the home country. Many of the soldiers in China are about to have their service terms expire, so their strength is increasingly lacking. It is now heard that the Japanese Army and Navy Ministries, in order to remedy the shortage of soldiers, have submitted a bill to this year's annual meeting to extend the national limit for first-line reserve soldiers. It is heard that the content of this new bill stipulates that the army's military service should be extended by three years, and the navy's military service should be extended by one to two years.

### Japanese Legislator Proposes Castration - Advocates Racial Eugenics - Considers it a Pressing Need

(Tokyo) Two members of the Constitutional Democratic Party criticized the Ministry of Health and Welfare for being too cautious and slow, resulting in a lack of satisfactory results in the near future. Therefore, they plan to submit a bill on castration to the Diet. They believe that this case is now an urgent matter. A member who initiated the case said that this term sounds frightening, but after the necessary surgery, men can return to work as soon as possible, and women only need to rest for two or three days. Japan recently raised the issue of castration for eugenics for public discussion. Opposition arose from all sides, and the momentum was very strong. Therefore, the Ministry of Health and Welfare did not dare to act rashly, decided to conduct a careful study of the issue, and did not promote this legal system. However, dissatisfied with this, two members of the Diet decided to directly promote this move in the Diet and named their bill the "Racial Eugenics Protection Act" and prepared to explain the reasons for its introduction in the Diet and vigorously defend it. Among other things, it stipulates that anyone can be subjected to surgery after being requested by a proper official, parent, or guardian, and approved by the Supervisory Committee. The rules of the committee will prevent the abuse of this principle so as not to adversely affect marital relations. (Reuters, 24th)

(Singapore) High-powered air raid alarm systems that can be heard two miles or more around are now being shipped from Britain to Singapore. The systems will be installed in six locations throughout the island as part of a comprehensive plan to protect Singapore. The authorities will take extensive precautions to protect hundreds of thousands of residents, mostly Chinese and Asians, who live in Chinatown, where eight to ten people are crowded into each small room. First-aid stations will also be widely set up in densely populated areas and elsewhere. Anti-gas operations will also begin shortly. (Reuters, 24th)

### Churches Protest Japanese Bombing of Chongqing

(Chongqing) The China Inland Mission, Friends Service Council, Methodist Church, National Bible Society, Seventh-day Adventist Church, and United Church of Canada sent a telegram to the League of Nations, protesting the Japanese aircraft bombing of Chinese civilians in Chongqing. The gist of the telegram is as follows: Our churches protest on behalf of the suffering non-combatants of Chongqing. The indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft on January 15th killed more than a hundred civilians. The bombed areas were not military targets. We request that the League of Nations arouse world public opinion to stop this barbaric behavior. (Associated Press, 24th)

### Japanese Troops Commit Atrocities and Massacred Overseas Chinese

(Fuzhou) Recently, more than 270 overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia boarded the British De Gillies Shipping Company's Haimen steamer in Rangoon to return to their home country. Unexpectedly, on the 14th, when the ship arrived outside Shantou, it was suddenly encountered by two submarines, which ordered it to stop. A large number of Japanese soldiers swarmed onto the ship, tied up all the passengers, and brutally murdered more than 200 Cantonese overseas Chinese. The ship was covered in blood and gore, a gruesome sight. Only more than 60 Fujianese overseas Chinese were able to survive and reach Fujian. The shipowner was also seriously injured, and the cargo was looted. This shows that the violence and cruelty of the Japanese army are increasing day by day. (24th dispatch)

### Japanese Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb Luoyang

(Luoyang) In the past week, Japanese aircraft have once again wreaked havoc in Henan Province. Tongguan, Shaanxian, Nanyang and other counties have been bombed one after another. Luoyang was bombed by nine Japanese aircraft this morning at 10:00 AM. After the Japanese aircraft invaded the city's airspace, they first strafed with machine guns, then bombed indiscriminately, dropping a total of more than 60 bombs. The four main streets of the city's commercial center, east, west, north, and south, and the Nanguan area were all ravaged. More than one hundred houses were destroyed, and the number of deaths and injuries already identified is fifty. In addition, the Swedish Christian Church on Beida Street, which had a clear Swedish national emblem, also had several houses destroyed by Japanese aircraft. This is another clear example of the Japanese disregarding foreign property. (24th dispatch)

Tongguan: Japanese aircraft harassed Tongguan three times today. The first time was around 9:00 AM, when one Japanese aircraft scouted over Tongguan for a week before fleeing northeast. The second time was around 10:00 AM, when seven Japanese aircraft were spotted by civilians and fled south. They passed through Zhaoyi and Huayin before reaching the airspace above Tongguan around 11:00 AM, dropping forty-two bombs in the city and the Dongguan and Beiguan areas, destroying twenty-two houses, and injuring only one civilian before fleeing. The third time was around 11:50 AM, when one aircraft circled over Tongguan several times before fleeing east. (24th dispatch)

Tongguan: At 2:00 PM today, a Japanese aircraft was spotted in the airspace above the Tiemen Railway Station between Xinan and Mianchi in Henan Province. Due to a mechanical failure, it crashed and burned near the station. The two pilots inside were both burned to death. (24th dispatch)

### Japanese Consul in Hanoi Denies Chongqing Claims are Pure Fabrications

(Chongqing) Today, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially stated that the rumors circulating in Shanghai that the Chinese authorities had escorted the Japanese Deputy Consul in Hanoi, who was arrested on the border of Guangxi Province, to Chongqing and that he is currently being interrogated are completely untrue. According to reports, this statement also spread widely in Chongqing three days ago. (Associated Press, 24th)

### The Japanese Side Uses Assassination as a False Flag Operation to Coerce the Tianjin Concessions

(Hong Kong) According to people from Tianjin, the recent assassinations in the French Concession in Tianjin, such as those of Liu Datong, Wang Zhulin, Jin Bitong, and Kawashima Yoshiko, were all carried out by the Japanese side themselves. It is said that the Japanese side intends to use this as a means to coerce the concession authorities, accusing them of harboring anti-Japanese elements, and demanding the inspection or blockade of the British and French Concessions.

### A Puppet Regime in Wuhan is Difficult to Establish

(Hankou) The Japanese in Hankou are attempting to form a "Special Municipal Government" for the three towns of Wuhan, but due to the difficulty in finding "talent," they have not yet succeeded. Moreover, the Japanese consider Wuhan to be close to Chongqing and an important forward base for the Japanese army, so it is difficult to feel at ease without the cooperation of powerful Chinese traitors. In Wuhan, water and electricity facilities are not fully functional, and Japanese military currency is flooding the market. Therefore, Chinese who have taken refuge in the countryside still dare not return to their former residences. In addition, there are frequent disputes between the Japanese and the French Concession authorities, and the people feel increasingly uneasy, making it even more difficult for a puppet regime in Wuhan to show its face.

### Miscellaneous News from Beijing and Tianjin

(Beijing) According to Chinese sources, Japanese engineers have recently been engaged in surveying the opening of a waterway between Tianjin and Shijiazhuang. The purpose of this is to connect the Ziya River, Hutuo River, and other rivers so that Tianjin and Shijiazhuang can be connected by navigation. This was one of many important events discussed by the Japanese side and the Hebei-Chahar authorities before the outbreak of the war. Building a railway from Tianjin to Shijiazhuang was also one of them, and now a waterway will be opened between the two places to replace the railway. (Reuters, 24th)

(Beijing) Chinese sources report that the Tianjin Bank of Communications will be reorganized as a branch of the so-called "Joint Reserve Bank." It has now closed its branches in Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Taiyuan and ordered its branches in Zhangjiakou, Suiyuan, and Baotou to continue operating in conjunction with the Mongolian-Tibetan Bank.

### A Blood Debt Owed to Fishermen of Guangdong: Nearly Ten Thousand Fishing Boats Burned, More Than One Hundred Thousand Fishermen Dead and Injured

Hong Kong Correspondent: Since the Japanese army invaded South China, the loss of life and property among civilians in Guangdong Province has been impossible to calculate. In addition to this, the brutal burning and killing of fishermen along the coast of Guangdong has been impossible to fully investigate for more than a year. The sheer size of the numbers and the cruelty of the situation are beyond general comprehension. The coastal areas of Guangdong Province are rich in marine resources, so the number of poor people who make a living by fishing, from Chaoshan to Southern Guangdong, should be over one million. Even in the areas near Hong Kong and Guangzhou, the number is around 300,000 to 400,000. The hardship of these fishermen's daily lives goes without saying. Since Japanese warships blockaded the Chinese coast, fishermen who went out to sea to fish were brutally killed by the Japanese army. To this day, the number of poor fishermen who have died unnatural deaths exceeds tens of thousands. This blood debt should also be one that the Chinese people will never forget.

Since the blockade of the Guangdong coast, ordinary fishermen, unaware of the dangers, still sailed out to sea to fish. Those who were lucky enough not to encounter Japanese warships were able to return as usual with a full load. Those who were unlucky enough to be encountered by Japanese warships were detained by the ships along with their boats and crew, insulted and beaten. The women and children on the ship were detained, and the men were forced to go ashore to buy food. Sometimes, the fishermen were also given contraband salt and sugar and asked to sell them ashore and use the money to buy food and vegetables to bring back. If they refused, the fishing boats were burned, and all the men, women, old, and young on board were killed. This continued for three months. The news was known to the people along the coast of Guangdong, and they all refused to sell food to suspicious fishermen. When the Japanese warships saw that their plan had failed, they left the men behind after detaining the fishing boats and forced the women to go ashore to buy food. This continued for several months. Fishermen along the coast generally dared not risk going out to sea again, or when they saw Japanese warships in the distance, they set sail and fled. The Japanese warships then opened fire or chased them with small motorboats. When they caught up, they raped the women, beat and humiliated the men, and plundered their belongings. By this time, most fishermen no longer dared to fish, and those who dared to risk going out to sea often never returned. This was the phenomenon in the early spring of last year.

As the spring turned into early summer, the activities of Japanese warships in the South China Sea became more frequent, and Japanese fishing boats came along to openly steal fish. At this time, ordinary fishermen, unable to make a living and with no one to turn to for help, could not sit and eat any longer. Driven by hunger, they had to risk their lives to go out to work. However, whenever they encountered Japanese warships or Japanese fishing boats, tragedy would strike. Everyone on board, regardless of age, gender, or sex, was brutally killed, and the boats were doused in kerosene and set on fire. Sometimes, the fishermen were tied up in the boats and then set on fire, burning them alive in horrific tragedies that occurred almost every day. Few were lucky enough to swim back to shore. According to unofficial statistics, since August 13th, nearly 10,000 fishing boats, large and small, have been burned in the Chaoshan and Southern Guangdong areas, and more than 100,000 fishermen have been killed or injured, with at least 10,000 to 20,000 dying at sea. Even in Hong Kong alone, Hong Kong fishermen who fished in nearby waters, their boats and people, were legally protected by Britain, but they were not spared from the disasters of burning and killing whenever they encountered Japanese warships. Sometimes, Japanese warships even invaded Hong Kong territorial waters to burn boats and kill people. According to a recent report from a Hong Kong fishermen's association, in the past fourteen months, a total of 1,092 Hong Kong fishermen have been killed, 628 fishing boats have been burned, and property losses are estimated at around 8 million. Hong Kong is a very small fishing area on the coast of South China and has British protection. The fact that so many fishing boats and fishermen have been brutally burned and killed is a testament to the horrific situation in other places, which is difficult to imagine.

After the Japanese army invaded South China, the devastation of fishermen in various places became even more severe. When the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, Japanese warships gathered in the waters of Daya Bay, Dapeng Bay, and the Pearl River Estuary. Hong Kong fishing boats, even when working within British territorial waters, had no guarantee of safety. Tragedies occurred every day, and thousands of fishing boats were docked in the port, with countless fishermen starving to death. At the same time, the source of fresh fish in the market was cut off, and prices soared. The severity of the problem was obvious. At this time, Hong Kong newspapers suddenly carried reports that the Hong Kong authorities had reached a "gentleman's agreement" with the Japanese army to rescue the fishermen. The agreement clearly stipulated that Japanese warships should not interfere with fishing boats registered with the Hong Kong government and fishermen native to Hong Kong who went out to sea to fish. However, the Hong Kong authorities subsequently issued a statement stating that there was no "gentleman's agreement" signed with the Japanese side, and most fishing boats were still unable to go out to sea. However, during this process (about a month ago), there were no tragic incidents of burning fishing boats near Hong Kong. However, recently, there have been reports of fishing boats being burned again, at least twice a week. From this point of view, the Hong Kong authorities have not signed any agreement with the Japanese side.

Currently, the livelihoods of fishermen along the coast of Guangdong Province have reached a dead end. In the past, the Guangdong Provincial Government had intended to provide relief and had proposed moving fishermen to the interior for resettlement, but this did not happen due to a lack of funds and personnel. As for the once-clamorous movement to arm fishermen and organize a maritime guerrilla force, it also became a pipe dream. Currently, fishermen in Chaoshan and Southern Guangdong have been unable to go out to sea for years, and their lives are unsustainable. Children are crying, women are weeping, some commit suicide, and others starve to death. The number who take risks or become beggars is also not small. Large and small fishing boats lie stranded on the beach, left to be destroyed by wind and rain, like waste. Some fishermen, unable to bear it any longer, are determined to be killed rather than starve to death, and they risk going out to sea. Few of those who can return safely are heard of. Moreover, these fishermen are different from land refugees. They have no farming experience and are not good at long-distance travel. Without the leadership of the authorities and a planned relocation, they can only look at the sea and sky and wait to die. Their situation is truly tragic.

### Four Japanese Soldiers Captured on Qingpu Highway - Japanese Army Burns Qibao Dujiaxiang

Qingpu Correspondent: At about 10:00 AM on the 21st, a Japanese army truck carrying four Japanese soldiers was traveling from Qingpu to Shanghai when it was discovered by a Chinese army sentry stationed in Dujiaxiang near Qibao. They immediately launched an attack. The Japanese soldiers also got out of the truck and fought back, but they were eventually surrounded on all sides by the defense team. Seeing that the situation was critical, the Japanese soldiers knelt down and begged for mercy. The guerrillas then disarmed the four Japanese soldiers and escorted them to the team headquarters. On the 22nd, a large group of more than 50 Japanese and puppet troops, led by Jin Honggao, went to the countryside and saw the truck still on the side of the road near Dujiaxiang, six li west of Qibao. They went to the village to search, but because the guerrillas moved unpredictably, they only found a shotgun in Zhang Haisheng's house. They then suspected that Zhang Haisheng had colluded with the enemy and escorted him onto the truck. On the same day, another seventy or eighty Japanese and puppet troops, still led by Jin Honggao, went to Qibao Town to search, and a part of them set fire to Dujiaxiang, turning the houses in the east village into a scorched earth.

### US Closely Watches European Situation, Willing to Help Britain and France Strengthen Military, Jointly Resist Threat from Aggressor Nations

(Washington) The world is paying close attention to the US attitude towards the European situation, especially the Spanish Civil War. Well-informed sources here recently stated that Britain and France are resisting coercion from totalitarian states. President Roosevelt intends to help democratic countries strengthen their military by more direct means. This approach involves assisting Britain and France in expanding their military, especially their air force. Regarding the Spanish issue, President Roosevelt is concerned that if the Nationalist forces win, the totalitarian states will gain a foothold across the Atlantic, threatening the Americas. Therefore, he is eager to express support for the Spanish Republican government. However, the President is still hesitant to decide alone on the matter of lifting the arms embargo. Legal advisors at the White House are also divided on whether the President has this authority. Military and political officials also hold differing views on whether lifting the arms embargo would be effective, given the rapid turn of events in the Spanish Civil War. Consequently, the US government has not yet decided how to respond to the Spanish problem. However, it is certain that they are paying special attention to Britain and France expanding their military. (24th Havas dispatch)

Italy Pressures France, Paris Deeply Wary

(Paris) The rapid advance of the Spanish Nationalist forces in the Catalonia front is causing great unease in France. Political figures deeply believe that once the Spanish Civil War ends, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will formally present various demands to France and refuse to honor promises. He will maintain troops stationed in mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean to exert pressure on France. The French government only hopes that Prime Minister Mussolini's guarantee not to covet Spanish territory will remain effective and does not intend to take any action. However, if Italian troops do not withdraw from the Balearic Islands, France will also have the right to send troops to Spanish Morocco and other places in Africa. The "Times," known for its moderation, also expressed agreement on this point, which is noteworthy. The newspaper also suggested that the French government should send commercial representatives to Burgos, the seat of the Spanish Nationalist government, and consult with Germany in accordance with the Franco-German peace declaration of December 6th of last year to avoid creating an emergency situation that would force France to take action. (24th Havas dispatch)

(Berlin) German newspapers are closely watching the developments in the Spanish Civil War, many saying that the fate of Barcelona and even the Spanish Republican government is already sealed. The "Völkischer Beobachter" reported that Britain and France have felt "disappointed" regarding the current situation in Spain. The Berlin Stock Exchange Daily reported that the mechanized units belonging to the Spanish Nationalist forces must continue to advance and wipe out the remnants of the Red Army (referring to the government forces) until the last drop of gasoline in the tanks is used. The Red Army cited the events of Madrid as an example (referring to the Nationalist forces besieging Madrid for two years without capturing it). In reality, the power of the Nationalist forces is different from that of 1936. (24th Havas dispatch)

### Stimson's Letter to Hull: Sympathy for the Spanish Government; US Newspapers Publish Contents

(New York) Former Secretary of State Stimson's letter to Secretary of State Hull regarding the lifting of the embargo on arms shipments to Spain (sent on the 21st of this month, but not yet released by the State Department) has been published by the New York Times. Stimson's argument explains the legal status of the Spanish Republican government and compares the attitude the US has historically taken towards foreign wars similar to the Spanish Civil War, as well as the US stance during the European War. He concludes that the embargo on Spain should be lifted, arguing that the embargo is not related to ideological differences, but is actually for the sake of the US's own interests. The following is an excerpt from the original letter: "The Spanish Republican government is the only legitimate government in that country. The governments of Britain, France, and the United States have all recognized it. This recognition transcends everything. Once recognized, it does not matter whether the recognized regime is communist, fascist, monarchist, or democratic. These ideological concepts are purely internal Spanish matters and should not be interfered with by other governments. Therefore, the Spanish Republican government, as a member of the international community, is entitled to all the privileges it deserves, the most important of which is to take defensive measures to deal with all kinds of rebellion and to maintain its power. Neighboring and friendly countries should also provide friendly assistance to countries threatened by civil war, allowing them to purchase arms to stop the rebellion, and should exercise restraint and refuse to provide assistance to parties that defy the law. This should be the obligation of all friendly and neighboring countries. To implement neutrality laws in the midst of a rebellion, before the rebels have acquired the status of belligerents, is fundamentally not applicable. The non-intervention agreement established by European countries completely obliterates international norms for limiting the expansion of conflicts. As a result, the legitimate government of Spain can no longer purchase arms in world markets. On the contrary, the rebels are not only not restricted in their supply of arms, but also have the assistance of Italian troops. How can this be considered fair? The US is in a different position from other countries. US interests are not directly involved. Arms purchases by the Spanish government can be allowed without fear of causing a crisis. Today, the Spanish Republican government has resisted aggression on land, sea, and air for thirty months. If the result is still failure, the reason is obvious: they have been deprived of the arms necessary for self-defense by various countries. At this point, President Roosevelt should immediately lift the arms embargo. In my opinion, the President not only has the authority to take this measure, but also has sufficient reason to do so in light of the international situation of the past two years. The original purpose of the arms embargo was to prevent unforeseen events from threatening US peace. Who would have thought that the impact of the embargo would instead harm US peace? As for abandoning our country's traditional spirit and hoping to avoid hostility from countries that disregard international law, I fear that this attitude is not enough to enhance our country's prestige and security."

### Spanish Rebels Approach Barcelona, ​​Defenders Resist Strongly; Government Agencies Relocate, Preparing for a Last Stand in the Northern City

Lérida: The Nationalist forces are advancing rapidly, taking advantage of the clear weather. The town of Martorell, fourteen miles from Barcelona, ​​an important intersection on the highway, is reportedly occupied by the Nationalist forces. It is also reported that two Nationalist divisions launched an encirclement operation towards Manresa yesterday afternoon. Last night, the Moroccan troops of the Nationalist forces approached the Barcelona airport in the southern coastal area, with the range of their artillery almost reaching the airport. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Lérida: The Nationalist forces have completely surrounded the town of Manresa and began attacking the city this morning. Tanks and artillery are covering the infantry's advance. Although the government forces' defenses are extremely strong, Nationalist forces personnel expect the town to be captured before noon today. (24th Reuter dispatch)

(Paris) According to a dispatch from Perpignan received here today, the Spanish administrative departments have withdrawn from Barcelona and moved north to Girona or Figueres. However, the government remains in Barcelona and has not moved, and it is said that the government forces are still resisting the Nationalist forces. (24th Reuters dispatch)

(Paris) According to today's "Le Matin", the defense of Barcelona will be led by General Miaja, the hero who defended Madrid. It is reported that General Miaja is expected to arrive in the city by plane today. Everyone hopes that General Miaja can repeat the history of 1937, when he reorganized the ranks in Madrid at a critical moment, and therefore the city was not captured by the Nationalist forces. (24th Reuter dispatch)

Barcelona: Nationalist aircraft have bombed the city a total of 26 times in the past 50 hours. Air raid alerts have been almost continuous. The docks and the old city center have been heavily damaged. The atmosphere in the city is extremely tense, and many residents have fled. The government departments have also prepared everything to move elsewhere if necessary. All intersections on the main streets are heavily guarded by the military to prevent Nationalist sabotage teams from taking the opportunity to create disturbances. As for the front line, the war has at least temporarily stalled. The Garraf Massif is the last barrier for the city of Barcelona. The Nationalist forces' three attacks today were repelled. In addition, in the cities of Capellades and Piera, although the Nationalist forces launched fierce attacks on Martorell and Manresa, they were also met with fierce counterattacks by the government forces and failed to achieve their goals. The government forces are also rushing to build strong fortifications everywhere to block the enemy's advance. (23rd Havas dispatch)

### Italian and German Air Forces Participate in the War and Indiscriminately Bomb; Many British Cargo Ships Hit

Barcelona: Italian and German aircraft, under the leadership of rebel leader General Franco, carried out large-scale bombings today, sinking four British cargo ships and damaging four other British ships. After the rebels dropped dozens of bombs on the harbor area of Barcelona, ​​at least two British sailors were killed and many others were injured. The total number of casualties after today's air raid was 12. The coast has become a pile of scrap iron and rubble. It is expected that bodies can still be found in the rubble. The British transport ship "Yorkbrook I" was hit several times yesterday and was attacked again today. Because all the structures on the deck were destroyed by the bombing, it sank. Another British ship was continuously bombarded and sank at noon today after the sailors abandoned it. The ship had previously entered the harbor for repairs due to engine problems, but was suddenly attacked yesterday. Six sailors were killed in the second attack this morning. The British transport ship "Huntress" was bombed yesterday and attacked again this morning, causing 14 injuries to the hull. Fortunately, it did not sink. The crew area of the "Dover Harbour" was completely destroyed, and the hull was pierced by bullets in three places. The "Stanbrook," which had been bombed several times in the Spanish war, was bombed again today seven miles off the coast by the rebels. The extent of the ship's damage is not yet known, but it is believed that it will not sink. Two people were killed when the "Soulpepper" was bombed. In the past few days, British ships that have been attacked include "African Mariner," "Yorkbrook," "Huntress," "Dover Harbour," "Coast Sprite," "Stanhemen," "Soulpepper," and "Stanbrook." In addition, the French transport ship "Charles Heienic" was also bombed yesterday. (24th Associated Press dispatch)

### British and American Nationals Prepare to Evacuate

Barcelona: British and American warships are prepared today to evacuate their respective nationals. The US consulate has warned American citizens to move to safe areas outside the city and has asked them to gather in Calella, 20 miles north of Barcelona, so that they can be transported by US warships. At the same time, British warships are also waiting there for the evacuation of British nationals. It is now determined that 30 British nationals will leave Barcelona.

### British Cabinet Subcommittee Discusses How to Deal with the European Situation; Germany's Eagerness to Prepare for War Cannot Be Ignored; Berlin Denies Army Mobilization Next Month

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain met with opposition Labor Party leaders Attlee and Greenwood this afternoon to inform them of the recent talks in Rome between British and Italian cabinet members. He then convened an emergency cabinet subcommittee meeting. Foreign Secretary Halifax, Home Secretary Hoare, Minister for Coordination of Defence Inskip, President of the Board of Trade Stanley, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs MacDonald, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cadogan, and the British government's foreign policy advisor Vansittart were all present. The discussions, which lasted from 3 PM to 5 PM, reportedly focused on the German issue. Since the dismissal of Schacht, President of the German Central Bank, the situation has changed. In addition, the German government has recently issued several military orders and concentrated all power in the Nazi Party, which must be watched closely. It is also rumored that the German army will partially mobilize in mid-February. It is said that once the Spanish Civil War ends, Germany and Italy will raise the entire colonial issue. Upon hearing this, Britain has been commenting extensively, saying that French Foreign Minister Bonnet is scheduled to deliver a speech to the French National Assembly tomorrow, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a speech in Birmingham on the 28th of this month, explaining where "British resistance" lies. German leader Hitler is scheduled to deliver a speech on the 30th of this month, the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule. The state of the international situation will be revealed at that time. (23rd Havas dispatch)

(Berlin) Regarding the rumor that the German army will hold exercises in mid-February, a military spokesman here recently issued a statement to Havas denying it, saying that the German army, navy, and air force will not hold joint exercises until next autumn. (24th Havas dispatch)

### Chamberlain Calls on People to Join Voluntary Service, Preparing for Self-Defense to Prevent Disasters

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a radio address last night to launch the government's campaign to recruit national defense volunteers, saying that this is a plan to train us to prepare for war. However, this does not mean that war is about to break out. He has done everything in his power to maintain peace for his country and for others, which is known to everyone. He will continue to devote himself to this in the future. Although Britain will never start a war, it may be forced to join a war started by other countries. If other governments believe that Britain cannot effectively defend itself, then Britain may be attacked. The more prepared we are to defend ourselves against the enemy, the less likely aggressor nations will attempt a victory that is by no means certain. Modern warfare is very different from previous wars. Since the development of the air force, the inland safety of the past is no longer available. Civilians will be the victims of war, no different from soldiers, sailors, and airmen. Not only that, civilians may be the first to be sacrificed. This is true not only in Britain, but also in other countries on the continent. Therefore, if we want to protect civilians in wartime, we must have the necessary organizational preparations in peacetime and have adequate training. If we start training only when the war has already started, it will be too late. Therefore, the plan to recruit volunteers is a common plan to prevent disasters, which is as necessary for our security as battleships, cannons, and aircraft. He hopes that people will read the national defense handbook, which contains words related to the entire nation, and will see that there are many types of services to assist public safety in wartime. All those who have not yet engaged in this necessary work are requested to choose one of the services that they consider most suitable for themselves and immediately receive the necessary training. People must know that this is a voluntary system. Some people have advocated a compulsory system, believing that compulsion is more effective than voluntarism. However, we live under a democratic system and have a tradition of freedom, so a compulsory system is incompatible with this. We firmly believe that Britain will be able to obtain the volunteers it desires without the need for compulsion. Today, most people are asking how they can help. Our suggestions to the people have given the people the opportunity to show the world how free people prepare to contribute to defending their freedom and ideas. He firmly believes that this call will be answered by the whole country. (24th Reuter dispatch)

### Spanish Refugees, Supporting the Old and Carrying the Young, Flee into France

Perpignan, Southern France: As the Spanish Nationalist forces advance towards Barcelona, ​​many Spanish refugees have fled into France. The French authorities have decided to increase the number of gendarmes patrolling the border. When Spanish refugees enter the country, they will first be questioned and sent to designated locations for temporary shelter, and then sent back to their country in batches. In addition, after the Spanish Republican government decided to declare martial law in all its territories, Spanish Republican government officials here commented that this move is extremely important and that Catalonia's autonomous system has been temporarily abolished as a result.

### Italy Conscripts Young Men into the Army; Standing Army Increases to 500,000; Navy Strengthens Submarine Fleet

(Rome) It has been confirmed that Italy has conscripted young men born in 1901. As a result, Italy's standing army will increase from 300,000 to 500,000. Currently, the standing armies of other European countries are: France, 654,000; Britain, 218,000; Germany, 750,000. Italy's decision to increase its standing army may be to cope with the international changes after the end of the Spanish war. It is also possible that Italy has 73 classes of manpower that can be mobilized in wartime, totaling 9 million people. (24th Associated Press dispatch)

(Rome) Naval authorities here have revealed that plans have been made to build 20 new submarines in the past, 14 of which are over 1,000 tons. Those sailing in the ocean have a range of 6,000 to 10,000 miles. Including the newly built ones, Italy will have a total of 47 submarines. (24th Associated Press dispatch)

(Rome) Foreign rumors that the Italian authorities have conscripted 200,000 reserve soldiers born in 1901 have been denied by the authorities here, saying that the number of Italian reserve soldiers entering training this year is the same as in previous years. Some of them belong to special units of radio and tanks. The bustling scene in the barracks in Rome is due to the upcoming 16th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Party army on the 1st of next month, when a military parade will be held. At that time, 20,000 specially trained army soldiers equipped with the latest weapons will participate in the inspection. There is no other reason. (24th Havas dispatch)

### Italian Foreign Minister Will Visit Berlin to Woo Hungary and Yugoslavia; Diplomacy Has Been Successful

(Paris) "Le Journal" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that, according to German sources, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to go to Berlin on the 28th of this month to hold talks with German leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the situation in Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and Spain. When Hitler delivers a speech in the Reichstag on the 30th of this month, the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, he is expected to explain Germany's attitude towards Italy's wishes and declare that if France dares to aid the Spanish Republican government, it will cause serious repercussions. In addition, the Italian government recently sent former Finance Minister Volpi to Berlin to discuss economic issues with the German authorities. German Four-Year Economic Plan Dictator and Aviation Minister General Göring is scheduled to go to Rome in early next month to hold talks with the Italian authorities and then travel to Italian Libya in North Africa. The frequent contacts between the German and Italian authorities can be seen from this. (24th Havas dispatch)

Budapest: Foreign Minister Ciano plans to reciprocate to Warsaw on February 11, and Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky plans to reciprocate to Rome in early March. (24th Reuter dispatch)

Yugoslav Capital: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano returned to his country by train from here yesterday. On the train, he told the press that he had spent several days with Prime Minister Stojadinović, holding talks with each other. The situation has been clarified, and the pacification work in this corner of Europe has been further advanced. Prime Minister Stojadinović and I are both determined to facilitate this pacification work and general cooperation in the Danube River Basin. One thing that must be explained is that Italy's diplomatic actions in this regard are all within the Rome-Berlin axis. (23rd Havas dispatch)

Budapest: After the Italian Foreign Minister held talks with the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister yesterday, the Hungarian news agency MTI commented on the matter, saying that Hungary and Yugoslavia have become closer as a result. Regarding this, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky said during Ciano's visit the other day, "A friend of our friend is also our friend," which can be seen. (24th Havas dispatch)

### Eden Speech: Opposes Compromise; Britain and France Should Resolutely Defend Mediterranean Interests

(London) Former Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech in Coventry last night that the world can understand sooner rather than later that democratic countries cannot be confused or intimidated into ceding their legitimate rights, and that all parties concerned can benefit more. Developments in Spain are very worrying. In the current state, the greatest contribution that Britain and France can make to peace is to express their resolute defense of their interests in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. What Britain and France are most concerned about in Spain is respect for Spain's political independence and territorial integrity. If General Franco wins, it will be a victory for foreign countries. Some countries, although verbally claiming that they will not interfere in the Spanish war, have interfered to such an extent as to guarantee General Franco's victory. However, these countries say that if France dares to do even a small part of what they have done, they will reconsider the overall situation. I ask, can this kind of arbitrariness be the basis of friendship? (22nd Reuters dispatch)

### Future Trends in German Diplomacy: Development Towards Eastern Europe, Detailed Analysis by British Press

(London) The Berlin correspondent of the Times recently published an article analyzing the current state of Germany. The article stated that the future steps of German foreign policy are a matter of general speculation. Major clues will only be revealed after Hitler delivers his speech to the Reichstag on January 30th. Regarding the visit of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Warsaw today, although Germany promotes the principle of self-determination, it has not yet attracted all parties. However, Germany is in a position to demand active cooperation from neighboring countries in its Eastern European policy. Poland will first seek complete intelligence regarding Germany's Eastern European intentions before isolating itself from Western Europe and joining anti-communist causes. On the German side, Berlin may inform Poland about the redistribution of African territories within the Axis powers and national processes, assuring them that Poland's demands will not be forgotten when the time is right. As for the dismissal of the President of the German National Bank, Schacht, and the transfer of Hitler's confidant, Weidemann, to the post of Consul General in San Francisco, it is evident that Hitler and Ribbentrop's foreign policy seems to disregard any adverse effects on Germany's monetary future and aims to complete the maximum possible military preparations in the shortest possible time. As for Eastern Europe, being the weakest line of resistance, it is speculated that Germany will devote all its efforts there in the near future. It is said that Germany aims to secure its food and raw material supply first before confronting Western European countries, and will therefore focus its efforts on Eastern Europe. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Germans Purchase Land in Central America, Possible Naval Base, U.S. Political Circles Feel Uneasy

(Washington) The news that a German, Eisberg, purchased a rubber plantation in Samaná Bay, Dominican Republic, Central America, has caused great unease among political figures here. It is said that the bay could be used as a naval base. The U.S. government once considered this and President Roosevelt personally inspected it during his cruise in Central American waters. The fact that the Germans now have a foothold there should be given attention. (Havas, 23rd)

### Anglo-German Trade Relations: Distribution of World Markets, Britain Hopes for Reasonable Solution

(London) The London German Chamber of Commerce held its annual meeting today. A large number of leading figures from British and German business circles attended. The German Ambassador to Britain, Dirksen, personally attended as chairman and delivered a speech, expressing optimism about the future of Anglo-German trade relations. He said: "The merits of each country's economic system can be set aside. It is possible for each country to meet its domestic needs through trade. This has been the case in the past and remains so today. We must pay attention to the evolution of the situation, adapt to the times, and ensure that each issue is resolved. In this regard, if the British and German industries can establish closer cooperation, it will definitely be of great benefit to the future of bilateral trade." (It is noted that the German Industrial Federation will conduct negotiations with the Federation of British Industries.) The British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, also gave a reply, saying that the difficulties currently faced by German commerce are due to the active expansion of military preparations. ... If countries want to develop trade, they must strive to improve the international situation and restore international confidence, which is a necessary step. If the current tense situation in Europe is not eased, there is no hope for the improvement of international trade. Our Prime Minister Chamberlain has repeatedly strived to resolve various international disputes through peaceful negotiations. It would be fortunate if other governments could respond with similar actions. I deeply hope that Britain and Germany can reach a reasonable and satisfactory solution to the issue of the distribution of world markets as soon as possible." (Havas, 23rd)

### President Roosevelt's National Defense Plan: Landon Expresses Support, Vinson Demands Appropriation for Harbor Construction, House Committee Begins Review

(Washington) According to House Republican Majority Leader Martin, the House has formed an eleven-member National Defense Committee, chaired by Republican Congressman Vreeland, to review President Roosevelt's foreign policy. According to most observers, the Republican Party will be able to support President Roosevelt's defense policy, because the 1936 Republican presidential candidate Landon yesterday expressed full support for President Roosevelt's foreign policy and asked the people of the country to unite to prevent aggression by dictatorial states at a time when their expansionist ambitions are at their peak. (Associated Press, 24th)

(Washington) The House Naval Affairs Committee will hold a public hearing tomorrow on the Vinson Act, which calls for the immediate appropriation of $650 million. This fund is intended for the construction of fifteen emergency naval ports in the U.S. Pacific and Caribbean regions. Senior naval officers are currently drafting a letter to the Naval Affairs Committees of both houses, supporting the Navy's request to immediately arm Guam. At the same time, the Navy is urging Congress to quickly allocate $5 million to dredge Guam's harbor and for other improvements on the island. According to the Navy, the development of Guam is not only beneficial to military affairs but also to commerce. In the Caribbean region, there are also two naval bases awaiting armament: Great Corn Island and Fonseca Bay. These are both leases concluded between the United States and Nicaragua in 1914, with a term of 99 years. After these two places are armed, the Panama Canal and the proposed Nicaragua Canal will be protected. (Associated Press, 24th)

### U.S. Cabinet List: Hopkins Appointed Secretary of Commerce, Approved by Senate

(Washington) The appointment of former Works Progress Administrator Hopkins as Secretary of Commerce has been formally established after being passed by the Senate today by a vote of 58 to 27. There was a fierce debate in the Senate when discussing this issue, as many conservative Democrats and Republican congressmen attacked Hopkins for diverting relief funds to election expenses. The list of current U.S. government ministers is as follows:

Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Secretary of War Woodring, Attorney-General Murphy, Secretary of Transportation Farley, Secretary of the Navy Swanson, Secretary of the Interior Ickes , Secretary of Agriculture Wallace ,Secretary Of Commerce Hopkins, Secretary of Labor Miss Perkins.

### The Caliphate Issue

(London) The title of Caliph of Islam has historically been held by the Turkish Emperor, who, in addition to holding religious authority, also exercised jurisdiction over the Islamic holy sites. However, since the Turkish Revolution, this relationship has disappeared. Recently, there has been talk of King Farouk II of Egypt assuming the position of Caliph. British officials have not received any definite information and refuse to comment, but Arab人士 here are very interested after hearing the news. The Egyptian royal family has hoped that King Farouk would assume the position of Caliph for some time. The obstacle lies in the long-standing custom that anyone who assumes the position of Caliph should not only be in a leading position in religion, but also be the head of state in the administration of the Islamic holy sites, namely Medina and Mecca in the Hejaz, and Jerusalem in Palestine. Therefore, if the King of Egypt were to be the Caliph, it would have a great impact on the Hejaz. Regarding this, King Ibn Saud of the Hejaz has not expressed his support so far. According to人士 in the Hejaz, the representatives of the Arab countries are currently gathered in the Egyptian capital, but their purpose is only to make a pilgrimage, and they have no right to elect a Caliph. Moreover, if the election of a Caliph is inevitable, it should be jointly participated in by representatives of Muslims from all over the world, and should not be done solely by representatives of the Arab nationalities. Moreover, the Caliphate system was originally a relic of the former Turkish Empire. Now that the Turkish Empire has disintegrated, even if one wants to restore this system, it is difficult to force other countries of the Arab nationalities to submit to it. Therefore, it is generally believed that if one wants to promote cooperation among the countries of the Arab nationalities, one should find other more solid foundations than restoring the Caliphate system. The urgent task is to first make the people of Egypt unanimously love King Farouk, instead of eagerly seeking the support of the countries of the Arab nationalities. (Havas, 24th)

### Amidst Japanese Army's Westward Invasion, Guangxi Province's Scorched Earth Policy: Japanese Army Attempts to Invade Guangxi in Three Routes, Guangxi Evacuates Population and Destroys Highways

Guangxi Correspondence: Since the fall of Guangzhou, the Japanese army's forces have extended to the Sanshui River estuary and Makou area of the West River for more than two months. The Chinese and Japanese armies have formed a state of confrontation in the West River area. Guangxi Province is located upstream of the West River. Since the Sanshui River estuary was occupied by the Japanese army, the Japanese fleet has also frequently appeared in Beihai of Qinzhou and Lianzhou. In the past week, more than 20 large and small Japanese warships have gathered in the Beihai waters, and have occupied Weizhou Island, which is more than 20 miles away from Beihai waters, and opened up a large airfield. According to information obtained by the Guangxi authorities, it is said that the Japanese army is preparing to divide its troops into three routes to invade Guangxi Province. One route is to advance from Sanshui in the West River, first take Zhaoqing as a stronghold, and then advance up the river to attack Wuzhou. The second route is to advance from Sihui and Guangning to Huaiji, bypass Babu and Hexian, and attack the back of Wuzhou. The third route is to land in Beihai, pass through Qinzhou and Lianzhou, and attack Nanning. In recent weeks, the Japanese troops on the above three routes have slightly increased. The number of troops in the Sanshui River estuary has increased to more than 3,000 including those previously stationed. The vanguard of the Japanese army in the Sihui area has advanced to Langgang Market, separated from the Chinese army by only a small river, facing each other. It is only 35 miles away from the county seat of Sihui. If Sihui is lost, Guangning will also be in danger, and the impact will inevitably extend to Huaiji. It can be seen that the situation in the West River is gradually becoming tight. However, the Guangxi authorities have long prepared defenses for national defense. After Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi returned to Guangxi, more precise planning was made for the coordination of arms and the replenishment of equipment. Generally speaking, preparations for resistance are divided into two aspects: active and passive. The active aspect is roughly to enrich all military preparations. This matter is related to military secrets, and outsiders should not know the details. The passive aspects are roughly: (1) All women, children, and the elderly in cities, towns, and villages within 30 miles of both banks of the river from Wuzhou to Nanning are evacuated to other areas. Grains, miscellaneous grains, kerosene, raw oil, medicinal materials, and other items stored in cities, towns, and villages on both sides of the coast are only allowed to retain enough for the use of residents of each city, town, and village for one month. If there is any surplus, it must be transported to areas more than 30 miles away. (2) All roads in Guangxi Province, except for the main trunk lines (i.e., the Guilin-Liuzhou-Nanning-Longzhou line), other lines, such as the Yongqin Highway (Nanning to Qinzhou), the Guilin-Yulin Highway (Guixian to Yulin), the Wubo Highway (Pingnan Wulin Market to Bobai), the Rongcang Highway (Rongxian to Cangwu), and the Yulu Highway (Yulin to Luchuan), are all destroyed. In addition, the highways from Guangxi Province to Lingshan, Lianjiang, Huaxian, and Hepu, which are connected to Guangdong, are also completely destroyed, starting from January 1st. Residents near each highway, from the age of 15 to 50, regardless of gender, must be conscripted to undertake road destruction work. Therefore, every day on each road, there are more than 10,000 male and female workers engaged in destruction, which also shows the spirit of national mobilization. After the destruction of each road, no vehicles can pass from Guangxi Province to Beihai and Guangzhou Bay and other places. Only single people and horses can carry things on their shoulders and backs and travel along small roads. Fortunately, the治安 along the way from Guangxi Province to Nanning is good, and there is no robbery. After destroying the highways along the way, the residents of the villages within 30 miles of the highways, and the stored food, are still relocated 30 miles away in the same way as the evacuation measures along the West River. Buildings near the highways and village self-defense碉樓 are also demolished when necessary. This method is probably a kind of scorched earth plan.

### Central Relief Committee Sends Personnel to Inspect Western Yunnan Border Region: Plans to Relieve Refugees and Reclaim Borderlands

Kunming Correspondence: Since the War of Resistance, the war zone has expanded and the number of refugees has increased sharply. In order to provide relief and reclaim the borderlands, the Central Relief Committee has specially sent its member Lin Chongyong to Yunnan to organize a Western Yunnan Inspection Group to inspect the situation on the Yunnan border to prepare for resettlement. Mr. Lin came to Yunnan in early September of last year. After more than a month of preparation, on November 2, he and the members of the group set out from Kunming along the Yunnan-Burma Highway, passing through more than a dozen counties including Chuxiong, Dali, Baoshan, and Longling, and went west to the Burmese border for more than a month before returning to the province. Now, the situation of his experience is recorded as follows:

Organization Process

The working staff of the group totaled 25 people, mostly scholars and experts. The work was divided into three groups: social, agricultural and forestry, and mineral resources. The social group was divided into social, border administration, economic, ethnic, transportation, and health items. The agricultural and forestry group was divided into crop, forest, soil, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and pest items. The mineral resources group was divided into geology, soil, and products items. The local object was mainly the territory under the jurisdiction of the Tusi of the three administration bureaus of Luxi, Ruili, and Longchuan in Yunnan Province. The inspection period was originally set for two months. However, due to convenient transportation, the work was able to be intensified, and the task was completed in fifty days.

General Itinerary

The group departed from Kunming on November 2, arriving in Chuxiong on the evening of the 2nd, and arriving in Dali on the 3rd, and immediately began to work in groups. Working in Dali for five days, they arrived at Huanglianpu on the 9th, Yongping on the 10th, and Baoshan on the 11th. Working for a week, they arrived at Longling and Mangshi on the 19th, and Zhaofang on the 24th. On the 28th, they entered Burma's Mujie, and on the 30th, they arrived at Mengmao. On December 5, they arrived at Longchuan, and on the 11th, they arrived at Mujie. The places they passed were all areas inhabited by blind夷. Each time they arrived at a place, each member of the group went in batches to inspect the work they were responsible for.

Economic Status

It is said that the natural conditions in the border areas of western Yunnan are excellent, with beautiful mountains and rivers and majestic atmosphere. They are simply unlike barbarian lands. The climate is between temperate and tropical, which is better than inland and Nanyang areas. The cultivated land in the two basins of Mangshi and Longchuan is comparable to that of Kunming. Crops such as rice, cotton, tea, tobacco, and vegetables can be planted on a large scale. Animal husbandry and sericulture are easier to develop. Minerals are abundant and very easy to develop. The local土人 technology is immature, and they work less than four hours a day, while the income they receive is far above that of inland farmers. Its wealth and convenience can be imagined. The population in each area is less than 12,000. Calculated together in the three areas, there are only 670,000 people. Therefore, transporting refugees here to engage in development is the best ideal place. Moreover, the completion of the near highway makes all places accessible and unimpeded, and transportation is convenient and accessible everywhere. There is no problem for transporting. However, the瘴氣 in the area is indeed quite serious, but if large-scale development and sanitary equipment are inevitable, it is also very easy to eliminate.

Ethnic Issues

Ethnic issues, the area is known for its ethnic complexity, with a total of four ethnic groups, including Baiyi, Shántóu, Bēngtóng, and Biāobiāo. The Shántóu are the most barbaric and fierce, often committing murder and plunder. The Baiyi are docile in nature, and the beauty of the Yi women has always been intoxicating. The concept of chastity is more civilized than that of the Han people. Even before marriage, they can freely pursue the opposite sex to seek sexual comfort. They are often seen on Shántóu ridges, using flute playing as a sign of courtship. Whoever they are fond of will immediately seek to resolve sexual desire, and their parents will never interfere. However, after marriage, they are absolutely committed to chastity. They are especially responsible for economic production and never rely on men, so there is no so-called disregard for women. If this ethnic group is educated, the future is limitless. As for the Bēngtóng and Biāobiāo, they are not as large as the Baiyi and Shántóu, and their nature is also docile, making them easier to be 感化. In reality, the ethnic issue in the Yunnan border is actually the Shántóu road issue. However, if taught properly, it is not difficult to 感化 them. Because of their brave and fierce nature, training them to be soldiers to resist Japan can be of great help to the country. Moreover, the area borders Burma, and it is even more necessary to train them to defend the border.

Political Situation

In addition to the main counties in the Yunnan border areas that have county seats, the rest are administration bureaus and Tusi. The Tusi and local council are the masters of a place, with the greatest power. Therefore, fraud and exploitation are inevitable. Moreover, the area is located on the border, transportation is inconvenient, and supervision by the provincial government is difficult. There are many malpractices that should be thoroughly reformed.

The above is only the feelings of the group's inspection. The detailed situation will be available after all the materials are sorted out clearly. Currently, the working staff of the group, except for a part that remains in Myanmar for inspection, have all returned to the province. All the materials are being sorted out. As soon as they are sorted out, Lin will take them to Chongqing for reporting.

Work Assignment

The work of the group members is assigned as follows: First Social Group, leader Li Jinghan, Social Li Jinghan, Chen Maosui, Zhao Bo, Economy Chen Bisheng, Lin Dayu, Border Administration Lin Chongyong, Yin Huagong, Ethnicity Zhao Zhu, Jiang Yingliang, Transportation Ouyang Zheng, Wu Xueyun, Hygiene Yao Xunyuan. Second Agricultural and Forestry Group, leader Li Jidong, Agriculture and Forestry Li Jidong, Valuation Feng Zefang, Xiong Tingzhu, Guo Wenming, Plants Wu Zhengqi, Soil Song Daquan, Water Conservancy Wu Zunjue, Pests Zhou Shaomo, Surveying Zhang Hongji, Wu Zunjue, Zhou Shaomo. Third Geological and Mineral Investigation Group, leader Zhang Xiti, Geology Zhang Xisheng, Wang Jiayin, Minerals Zheng Duoxuan, Soil Song Daquan.

### New Strategy for Money Collection by the Kunshan Puppet County Government: Filling Rivers and Selling at a Price to Facilitate Japanese Army Car Traffic

Kunshan Correspondence: There are many rivers in Kunshan City, which are connected vertically and horizontally, which are either beneficial to ship traffic or convenient for drinking water and fire prevention. Because the inland has no tap water facilities, natural rivers are the only main artery of the city. Since the Japanese army invaded and occupied Kunshan, the main streets in the city have been filled with rubble, and no one cares. The puppet organization suddenly had a whimsical idea to hire workers to fill all the rivers in the city with rubble. The first to implement this was the river on both sides of Jiufang Bridge on Zhongdajie, which has been filled. Once a fire occurs, I don't know what method to deal with it. There is no public well in the city, so where does the water come from? Merchants are afraid of this policy of self-destruction and dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Secondly, the rivers in Nanjie have also been filled in several places. The puppet government has also issued a notice allowing people to pay for land purchase. Because the Nanjie area has always been a densely populated area, the land price is expensive, needless to say. Now the puppet side is planning like this, thinking that it can increase a lot of income. At the same time, it also plans to fill the Houbang River, the purpose of which is to widen the street and facilitate the Japanese army's car traffic. Because the Japanese army's Yifuban is in Fengchebang, and going back and forth to the county government must pass through Houhong. They have always been regretting the narrow streets. This move by the puppet organization is nothing more than a plan to please the Japanese. Now citizens Du Yuanshan and others believe that this method is really harmful to public interests and disregard民艱, and have jointly petitioned the puppet知事 to dismiss the proposal. I still don’t know what the result will be.

### Tianjin Traitors Publish Fake Newspapers to Confuse People's Hearts: Enthusiastic Elements Organize Anti-Traitor Group: Japanese Army Checks Pedestrians Very Strictly

Tianjin Correspondence: Since the Japanese army occupied Tianjin, they have repeatedly put pressure on the British and French concessions, causing frequent disputes between the British and French concession authorities and the Japanese army. Recently, the Japanese army has intensified its efforts and instructed traitors to create a Japanese newspaper (the Jiangdong Daily is one of them) to publish absurd news and sell it cheaply in the British and French concessions in order to 麻醉人心. However, in order to resist the traitors, the enthusiastic elements in the concessions are eagerly using mimeographs to secretly mimeograph small newspapers to report the true news of the War of Resistance in order to correct the errors of the fake newspapers. People scramble to buy and read them. At the same time, they also organized an "Anti-Traitor Group" to find out the whereabouts of traitors. At first, they would write letters of warning. If they were still obsessed with their mistakes, they would take further action.

The Japanese army and traitors in the city are uneasy because of the activities of the Chinese enthusiastic elements, so they have tightened their inspections. All ships coming from other ports must wait for the Japanese puppet inspectors to board the ship and check the crew and passengers one by one after reaching Dagu, and verify that the epidemic prevention certificate is undoubtedly questionable before they are allowed to enter the port. The only place where the British and French concessions and the Chinese界 traffic is a deep, long, narrow aisle. There is a Japanese soldier guarding the head of the道, and the traitors monitor and check the行人 coming in and out. Although there is no need for a pass or epidemic prevention certificate to enter and exit the Chinese界, they must take off their clothes and socks and stand naked in the aisle, regardless of gender, to wait for the people to search carefully. Even shoes and socks cannot escape their search. In this cold winter, pedestrians who come and go are naked on the道 and are all shivering. If they complain a little, they will be noticed by the traitors and will be punched and kicked by the Japanese soldiers. Pedestrians are only able to endure insults and be as silent as cicadas when being abused in this way. As for those who die on the roadside due to weakness and cold, there are not a few. The Japanese army and traitors also simultaneously check民居, knocking on the door in the middle of the night to search the house and go directly to the bedroom to check the number of people. If there is any discrepancy, they will be imprisoned lightly and killed severely. However, the guerrillas in the suburbs have not decreased due to the inspection. They often fight with the Japanese army in public. Therefore, whenever it is late at night and quiet, there are intermittent gunshots breaking the silence. This is the roar of the guerrillas.

### Jingjiang Japanese Army Invades Taixing unsuccessfully: Fierce Battle Between Two Armies in Tangjiazhuang

Taixing Correspondence: More than 400 Japanese soldiers from Jingjiang, with four light machine guns and two heavy machine guns, attempted to invade Taixing in five routes. At 8 am on the 20th, they first attacked Hamawei. The Chinese guerrillas came out to meet the attack. After the contact lasted until 12 o'clock, the Japanese army was unable to support themselves and retreated back to Jingjiang. The casualties on both sides have not yet been ascertained.

About 70 or 80 Japanese soldiers from Xiannvmiao in Yangzhou attacked Jiangjiaqiao at about 4 am on the 20th. At the same time, another part attacked Zhangwanggou. They encountered the Chinese army in Tangjiazhuang and fought fiercely. Another 30 or 40 Japanese soldiers from Kongjiazhuang and Dahanzhuang attempted to attack the Chinese army's position at Zhuanqiao. After learning that the Chinese army was prepared, they did not dare to act rashly. When the two sides were fighting fiercely in Tangjiazhuang, the Japanese army in Xiannvmiao fired 20 or 30 shells to show off their power. At the same time, the Japanese army in Yangzhou also fired shells outside Dongguan to help. About 50 or 60 Japanese soldiers came from Yangzhou, and 20 or 30 Japanese soldiers came from Shaobo to reinforce. The fierce battle stopped at about 10 o'clock, and the Japanese army retreated to Huojiaqiao.

### "January 28th" Approaches, All Circles Commemorate with Grief, Half-Mast Flag Throughout the City and Closure of Entertainment Venues for One Day, Japanese Side Alarmed, Implementing Preparations Starting Today

The eighth anniversary of the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident is approaching. Various circles in Shanghai will commemorate with deep sorrow. All entertainment venues in the city will prepare to voluntarily close for one day on that day. The Japanese side, deeply fearing guerrilla attacks taking advantage of the opportunity, has accelerated the implementation of preparations starting today, blockading the ports. Details are recorded as follows:

Shanghai Circles to Commemorate with Grief

All circles in Shanghai, taking the 28th of this month as the eighth anniversary of the Shanghai Incident, are now in a period of intense and comprehensive resistance. Millions of soldiers are fighting staunchly to protect the nation and defend the territory, striking back against the enemy. At this commemorative festival, it is even more alarming. In order to commemorate the martyrs of the resistance and the compatriots who died in the disaster, the entire city will fly flags at half-mast to express grief on that day. The city's frugal movement committee also advocates that citizens be vegetarians for one day, and the money saved will be transferred to donations and disaster relief funds. All entertainment venues in the city will voluntarily close for one day to express mourning.

Japanese Fear Attack, Intensify Preparations

The Japanese military authorities, deeply fearing that Chinese guerrilla forces will use practical actions to commemorate the anniversary of "January 28th" and launch a fierce attack on the Japanese army, are quite panicked. For several days, in the areas surrounding Shanghai, such as Nanshi, Pudong, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Longhua, and other Japanese-puppet garrison areas, they have built mat sheds and set up temporary sentry posts. On all major transportation routes, sandbags have been added and defensive works have been thickened. Their panicked and uneasy emotions are evident.

All Ports to be Closed Starting Today

In addition to intensifying defenses, the Japanese side has also dispatched warships and speedboats to patrol the ports on the north and south banks of the Yangtze River for several days. It has also been decided to close all ports today and reopen them after "January 28th" has passed. Furthermore, it has been decided to prohibit all ferry services between Pudong and Puxi, as well as small inland river ferries on the Suzhou River and Huangpu River. In addition, the authorities of the two concessions have decided to implement temporary preparations to maintain security within the concessions.

### This City's Rice Supply is Sufficient, Stockpiles Reach 700,000 Bags, but Private Smuggling Exports are Quite Rampant

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the concession authorities have been extremely concerned about the issue of food in the area, smoothing the sources of supply, regulating supply and demand, and strictly restricting the transit of rice from Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs, in compliance with the measures for food regulation during the emergency period, refused large-scale transit. Therefore, the import of rice into Shanghai is greater than the export. According to a survey by people in the industry, the current rice reserves in Shanghai are quite sufficient. All warehouses are full, and the stock of rice in rice shops is also piled up like mountains, with a total number of more than 700,000 bags. Moreover, the goods continue to arrive in a steady stream. There is no fear of food shortages for the citizens of Shanghai. However, Japanese merchants and merchants in North China have jointly formed a company to purchase directly from the producing areas, which is very active. Most of them are transported by ship from Changyinsha, Baimaokou, and other places to Yangshupu, and then loaded onto Japanese ships to Qingdao, and then transported to North China or directly to Japan, totaling more than one million dan. Therefore, the private smuggling of rice exports is still very rampant.

### British Ambassador's Wife Cares for Refugee Children, Praises the Gonghua Refugee Shelter, and Generously Donates

The Gonghua Refugee Shelter, founded by the Education Committee of the Chinese Staff Association of the Public Works Department, was originally located at 27 Tianjin Road. Later, because the landlord reclaimed the place for his own use, it was moved to 9 Zhengxiu Lane, Kaifeng Road yesterday. There are currently 320 refugee children, and all education and upbringing expenses are borne by the members of the association. Recently, it has been learned by the wife of Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, who deeply praised the enthusiasm of the members of the association for public welfare and the perfect management of the Gonghua Shelter, and generously donated 500 national currency to cover the expenses of the shelter. It is said that the association decided yesterday to use this amount as a fund for establishing a refugee children's library. The library is located in the Gonghua Shelter, but children from other shelters can also enter to read. Currently, the association employs more than a dozen teachers, and the education provided to refugee children is mainly practical. In the future, it plans to increase the number of refugee children to 500 and transform the shelter into a refugee education and upbringing institute.

After the prohibition of navigation in Dinghai (i.e., Zhoushan), East Zhejiang, the Dinghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed requesting resumption to facilitate freight transportation. The telegram reads: "To the Honorable County Chief of Dinghai, all ships in our county were ordered to suspend navigation due to incomplete registration procedures, which has been going on for a month.

Since then, another week has passed, and we have not received an order to resume navigation, causing panic among more than 400,000 people. Fish products are bound to rot, and the supply of general merchandise is cut off. Therefore, we specially telegram requesting your honorable county chief to consider the public opinion, and report the situation to the Ningbo Defense Headquarters, and quickly resume navigation to provide relief. The telegram does not express the urgency of waiting for orders."

### U.S. Asiatic Fleet Commander Visits Along the River, Inspects Church Associations and Commercial Properties, No One on Board Saw Mines Along the Way

The Continental Daily News reported that, according to responsible sources last night (the 23rd), Rear Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, sailed along the Yangtze River aboard his flagship USS Isabel, landing at Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Wuhu to inspect American church associations and commercial properties.

### Public Works Department Salary Review Committee, Taxpayers Willing to Attend, Department Employees Dissatisfied Because No One Attends, Westerner Stewart Conducts Investigation

The English-language "China Press" reported that after the Shanghai Municipal Council established a salary review committee, other taxpayers intended to provide the committee with all possible information, and therefore requested an opportunity to attend and state their views, and have already made a formal application. At the same time, Department employees are also dissatisfied, not with the committee members or their fairness, but because

No Department Officials

Attend. Therefore, it is suggested that a number of officials equal to the number of merchant representatives should attend. The only connection between the merchants serving as members and the Department is Mr. Mitchell, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Appointments Committee. Mr. Mitchell was also a member of the Economic Committee, which greatly reduced the salaries of employees more than two years ago. The Department employees feel that at least two representatives should be allowed to attend, one nominated by the Employees' Union and the other by the Police Department.

Police Constables Nominated

Because police constables are not allowed to join the union, and their views may not be known to the Department or the new committee. So far, the committee has only begun its investigation, and the Shanghai Municipal Council Taxpayers' Investigation Committee organized by Westerners Stewart and others is also continuing. According to Stewart, a reporter said that the Merchant Representatives Committee does not pay, so

Reasonably

A report can be expected soon, because their time is precious. Stewart wrote to the committee, requesting permission for him and several other taxpayers to express their opinions. He received formal notification from the committee that his application would be considered at a meeting this afternoon (the 24th). The "Investigation Committee" has been supplied by the Department with

Recent Salary Increase

Various documents and papers, and is currently studying them, so it refuses to discuss any aspect of the matter. The reporter visited the committee chairman, Hawkins, and did not meet him. He then visited American member Gillilan again this morning. According to him, he began to study the situation after being appointed, so

It Seems Unable

To Discuss. As to whether the committee will invite members of the Employees' Union to attend, or ask taxpayers to express their opinions, he could not answer. It is said that the committee is scheduled to reopen this afternoon. So far, the members are still studying the situation from various aspects.

### Detained New Annerley Ship, Released, Already Docked and Unloading Cargo, This Morning Returned to Shanghai Directly From Ningbo

The New Annerley, chartered by the American company Wisner & Co., had not yet had its cargo handling procedures approved separately, and set sail from Shanghai to Taiwan on the morning of the 15th, and then to Ningbo. On the 18th, it entered the Yong River. The Ningbo Defense Headquarters detained the ship for violating the navigation order, and prevented the unloading of cargo. The shipowner asked Mr. Xie Baosheng, a well-known person from this city who was on board, to go to Jinhua to explain and request its release. Yesterday, reporters from the Modern News Agency learned from the Shanghai head office that after arriving in Jinhua, Xie met with Xu Zhigan, Chief of Staff of the ×th Army Group, and stated that the shipowner violated the order due to unfamiliarity with the procedures, and requested leniency in consideration of the difficulties of the business. Xu understood and ordered that the procedures be completed and approved, and then released. The shipowner immediately complied. The ship was docked in Ningbo yesterday morning to unload cargo, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai directly from Ningbo at 9:00 AM today. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai tonight. If the docking is slightly delayed, it will be delayed until tomorrow morning.

### Guerrilla Team Intercepts Japanese Military Spies, Yesterday Near Chengjiaqiao, Five Japanese and Puppet Troops Were Intercepted

According to many residents in the Hongqiao Road area, after the Chinese guerrilla forces arrived in the area outside the Western District of the concession, Japanese troops and Japanese puppet police in western Shanghai were often killed. At 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, four Japanese people in plain clothes and one puppet police officer, each holding guns, were traveling in a sedan car from east to west. When they arrived east of Chengjiaqiao, not far from Zhongshan Road, they were discovered by the guerrilla team and intercepted and detained. At that time, the Japanese and others attempted to resist with guns, but were immediately surrounded by the guerrilla team and ordered to surrender their weapons and were tied up and taken away. It is said that the Japanese in plain clothes were Japanese military spies. The car was parked on the side of the road and had not left as of yesterday.

### Japanese Merchants Search for Ramie in Shanghai, Transport it to Japan to Supply Military Raw Materials, Shanghai Stocks Have Been Exhausted

Xin Sheng News Agency reported that ramie is a special product of our country and is famous in the international market. The largest purchaser is Japan, because although Japan also produces hemp, its quality is inferior, so it still purchases a large amount from our country as one of the textile fibers. It has a strong waterproof performance. In addition to being suitable for making ordinary clothing, it is also suitable for making canvas curtains, nets, ropes, and paper. The sky curtains, canvas boats, military uniforms, ropes, etc. used by the armed forces of various countries are made of ramie fabrics. The producing areas are Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and other provinces. After the war, because it is related to military use, its export is prohibited. However, Japanese merchants are searching for it in Shanghai and other places at high prices and transporting it to Japan on Japanese ships. Last year, 11,000 metric tons were transported to Japan, worth more than one million yuan. The value of exports to Japan the year before last was more than 29.6 million yuan. Now the ramie in the occupied areas and Shanghai has been almost exhausted by the Japanese. Some unscrupulous merchants, in order to make small profits, are purchasing from Hunan, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other provinces, and trying to smuggle it to Shanghai to supply Japanese merchants.

It is heard that the various god model shops have begun to sell the god model of General Qi.

### Japanese Suppress Foreign Trade in Yantai, Embassies and Consulates Seeking to Cope, Once the Situation in Yantai is Clear, Appropriate Action Will Be Taken

The Continental Daily News reported that the Japanese authorities in Yantai recently announced that export licenses will be issued for goods ordered before January 15 until January 31. Therefore, the Japanese suppression of foreign export trade in Yantai has been extended for half a month. However, according to the news from Yantai received last night (the 23rd), whether our foreign exchange regulations will also be relaxed in response to the Japanese temporary relaxation measures is not stated. The implementation of these regulations means that the sale of foreign exchange is indeed monopolized by Yokohama Specie Bank. If the Japanese continue to strictly enforce

Continuation of Strict Implementation

Its foreign exchange "official exchange rate", then Yantai will surely lose its prosperous lace and linen trade, which will be replaced by Shantou. Yesterday, it was learned from reliable sources that the embassies and consulates in North and Central America are still studying the report on the situation in Yantai. It is said that the information on the Japanese suppression of trade is neither complete nor clear. Therefore, the relevant foreign embassies and consulates will take

Appropriate Action

Once the situation in Yantai is clear. The Yantai news also said that the method used by the Japanese naval authorities in Qingdao to suppress the business of foreign merchants is similar to the method currently used in Yantai. According to the trade restrictions in Yantai, the office set up by the Japanese to control exports has the power to refuse to issue export licenses to Chinese and foreign merchants. This new restriction is closely following the already fully implemented

Control of Currency

New regulations are implemented. In fact, Yantai merchants cannot purchase remittances at the market exchange rate, but are forced to purchase them at the exchange rate set by the Japanese, which makes them unable to compete with merchants in other ports who purchase remittances at the market exchange rate. Although the implementation of these new regulations has been delayed, business circles in this city said yesterday that they believe that in view of the frequent Japanese interference, Yantai's import and export firms will

Find Themselves

Unable to continue to operate in North China. Earlier this month, Mr. Yamanaka, the "Deputy Director of the Yantai Port Office", a Japanese, published a notice in the Yantai newspapers, stating that from January 15 of this year, all ships entering and leaving the port must report the names of the passengers, goods, and crew members carried to the "Office". It is heard that after the implementation of this new regulation, the result has completely destroyed Yantai's foreign trade, and according to news from the area, Yantai merchants are pessimistic about trade opportunities in the area.

### Japanese Navy Stipulates Measures for Passage Through Hongkou, Restricted Passage Time, Restricted River Crossing Locations

Regarding the issue of passage between the concession and the Hongkou area, the Japanese side had previously notified the prohibition of passage and closed the Waibaidu Bridge, North Sichuan Road Bridge, and Zhapu Road Bridge. It is now learned that the passage measures have been re-established by the Japanese naval authorities. Those who hold passes can pass through the Hongkou area from 5:00 AM to 11:00 PM. The passage time for private cars and rickshaws is from 5:00 AM to 1:00 AM, but after 11:00 PM, they are not allowed to pass north of the Suzhou River. Chinese people who pass through the area in groups must submit their passes for inspection and have a police officer in charge. The inspection time is from 5:00 AM to 7:00 PM. The passage time for members of the Third International (foreigners) is from 5:00 AM to 1:00 AM the next morning. Those who pass through the area must abide by the regulations on the passage time. As for Zhoujiazui (near the fish market near Dinghai Bridge) and other places, passage is prohibited. It is stipulated that only private cars, chartered cars, taxis, carriages, and pedestrians can pass through the Waibaidu Bridge. It is stipulated that private cars, chartered cars (limited to private vehicles), pedestrians, groups of coolies, small carts, and rickshaws are allowed to pass through Zhapu Road Bridge. The opening time is from 5:00 AM to 7:00 PM. It is stipulated that empty trucks, private vehicles, carriages, taxis, and pedestrians are allowed to pass through the Sichuan Road Bridge.

### Pre-War Rented Chinese Ships: Japanese Merchants Attempt Hijacking, Violate Contracts, Refuse to Pay Rent, Chinese Shipping Companies' Negotiations Fail

Prior to the war, Japanese merchants rented over twenty ships, including the "New Taiping," "Shunfeng," "Wuyang," "Huamao," and "Huaxin," from Chinese shipping companies such as Zhongwei, Jiping, Huaxin, and Zhengji. At the time, rental contracts were signed stipulating the term and rent, to be paid in installments. After the August 13th Incident, the Japanese merchants attempted to hijack the rented ships, refusing to pay rental fees and failing to return them upon expiration. The Chinese shipping companies negotiated with the Japanese merchants, but with the exception of the "Songpu" ship of the Sanbei Company, which had been sold to the Italian-Chinese Company and whose release was negotiated by the Italian consul with the Japanese, the rest of the ships yielded no results. It is said that the Japanese merchants verbally agreed to temporarily deposit the rent in a Japanese bank and return it after the war, but in reality, they were definitely attempting to hijack the ships for their own use.

### Job-Seeking Women: Don't Go to "Manchukuo," Those Responsible Have Ulterior Motives

Those responsible have ulterior motives. Yesterday, a classified advertisement appeared in the "Personal" section of the English-language North-China Daily News, stating: "Warning" to young Chinese women: "If you are preparing to go to 'Manchukuo' and are being offered lucrative positions in foreign commercial firms in Shengjing, Shenyang, or Harbin, be aware of the tragic consequences that may follow, as those responsible have ulterior motives. Readers, please inform your Chinese friends about this matter." The person who placed this advertisement is to be admired for their benevolence, chivalry, and humanitarian spirit.

### Surprise Attack by Special Forces North of Dongtang Market, Changshu, Achieves Success: 70-80 Japanese Soldiers Killed, 13 Captured, 150 Boxes of Bullets and 40 Rifles Seized

On the 21st of this month, over 300 Japanese soldiers of the Takahashi unit transported a large quantity of ammunition and supplies, taking a dozen or so small motorboats and civilian vessels from Changshu. Around 11 PM that night, they passed the Xiaojiaqiao area, about four miles north of Dongtang Market in Changshu County. The special forces of the Military Affairs Commission, led by Xiong, received intelligence and immediately ordered Zhao, the commander of the ××th Regiment, to lead troops to intercept them. Fierce fighting ensued, lasting for over ten hours, from 11 PM that night until noon the next day. As a result, 70 to 80 Japanese soldiers were killed, 13 wounded Japanese soldiers were captured, and two small motorboats, over 150 boxes of bullets, and 40 rifles were seized. On the Chinese side, only three soldiers were wounded and one was killed. This decisive battle was one of the most victorious guerrilla battles in the area.

### "Heda" Ship: Japanese Side Has Agreed to Release, Detained in Qingdao at the End of Last Year, Confirmed to Be a Panamanian Merchant Ship

The "Heda" ship, a Panamanian vessel represented by the Norwegian trading company Wah Lun, loaded cargo in Shanghai and sailed to Fujian, then to Qingdao. At the end of last year, it was detained by the Japanese navy in Qingdao. The Panamanian consul then negotiated with the Japanese. This reporter learned from the shipping industry that after investigation by the Japanese side, the ship was confirmed to be a Panamanian merchant ship and has been agreed to be released.

### Ministry of Finance Cables Shanghai Banking Association, Prohibiting Private Purchase of Gold and Silver; If Used as Reserve for Banknotes, Issuing Bank Should Be Notified First

The Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Association received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: The purchase and exchange of gold and silver is a wartime financial policy. The Ministry has already designated the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China to establish gold and silver exchange offices, and to entrust commercial firms and other organizations to handle the exchange affairs. Jewelry stores and gold shops are no longer allowed to privately purchase gold and silver, in order to promote unified purchasing and prevent speculation and smuggling. However, financial institutions may still need to purchase gold and silver in the interior to provide reserves for banknotes issued by issuing banks. Considering that the purpose of purchasing is to deposit gold and silver with the four banks to back the banknotes, it can assist in the promotion of the legal tender and the exchange of gold and silver. However, in order to prevent abuse of the name for private gain, the following regulations should be established: Hereafter, if banks and money shops in various places have concluded banknote issuing agreements with the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, and therefore purchase gold and silver as reserves, they should first report to the issuing bank with which they are negotiating for banknote issuance, and also report to the gold and silver exchange office or its branches, for entrusted processing according to the case. The exchange office shall supervise the process to prevent fraud. Those who have not concluded banknote issuing agreements, or who do not report for entrustment, or who do not accept supervision, and still purchase gold and silver, will be considered as private purchases for profit, and the Ministry of Finance should be reported, and according to the circumstances, the gold and silver will be forcibly purchased, or other sanctions will be applied. In addition to sending separate telegrams, please forward this information to all financial institutions for compliance, and first report the date of receipt of the telegram and the compliance situation to the Ministry for record. Ministry of Finance, Ma Yuqian.

### 1938 Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial Report (Continued)

(Industrial Accidents) A total of 1,513 industrial and occupational accidents were reported to the Shanghai Municipal Council throughout the year (1,976 in 1937, 2,200 in 1936). At the beginning of the year, the number of workers in various factories was less than in previous years, which is one reason for the decrease in accidents. However, as the number of workers increased in the second half of the year, accidents should have increased. The opposite occurred, perhaps due to incomplete reporting. Therefore, new methods must be devised this year to collect reports. Several hospitals, at the request of the Industrial Department, regularly submitted reports. Others submitted fewer reports. Based on the records for the entire year, reports received from hospitals accounted for only 38%, compared to 63% in 1937. The Fire Brigade Ambulance Division of the Police Department, as well as a few factory owners, also submitted reports. The Industrial Department wanted factory owners to submit accident reports on time, but the actual results fell far short of this goal. The worker mortality rate last year was higher than in previous years. Of the 1,513 workers injured at work, 88 died (58 in 1937, 95 in 1936). This shows that 6.1% of accidents resulted in worker deaths. The mortality rates for the previous two years were 3% and 4.5%, respectively. Comparing last year's figures with those of 1936, there were fewer recorded accidents last year, but the number of deaths was almost the same as in 1936. Workers in the construction industry (including building and road construction) suffered the most deaths, with a total of 21, of whom 11 died from falls. In addition, 16 transportation workers, 13 machinery and metalworkers, and 11 textile workers were seriously injured and died. There were 14 fatal incidents related to mechanically powered machinery, 12 fatal incidents due to electricity, 11 workers died in factory fires, and 29 died from falls. Judging from the above figures, it can be seen that falls caused the most accidents, with the number of deaths being more than double that caused by machinery. Transportation workers suffered the most injuries, with a total of 325, of whom 21 died. Among workers in this occupation, 76 were injured between 9 AM and 12 PM, and another 56 were injured between 3 PM and 6 PM. This shows that the congestion on the streets during the above times is one of the causes of accidents.

(Age of Injured Workers) Workers between the ages of 15 and 19 are most likely to be injured. Last year's percentage was 21.1 (26.6% in 1937, 26.8% in 1936, 33.3% in 1935). Workers in the next age group are also prone to accidents. Logically speaking, the age group with the largest number of workers should also have the largest number of injured workers. Therefore, it can be inferred that the factories in this city employ mostly child labor. These child laborers have come from the countryside not long ago, are unskilled, and lack experience, which often leads to them being sacrificed in accidents.

In various factories that are gradually improving, steam is needed to produce products. Therefore, the number of boilers and other steam-powered machinery installed in new factories is very large. For example, silk reeling factories, dyeing factories, spinning mills, and paper mills all use steam-powered machinery as their main tools. The Shanghai Municipal Council's regulations for the management of boilers have been in effect for over two years. During this period, 454 boilers and 45 other steam-powered machines have been registered. Among these boilers, 76 installed in various places north of the Suzhou Creek have not been used. Therefore, there are still 378 boilers that have been registered and are in effect.

The goal of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Department in implementing management is to ensure that all boilers in all factories have valid certificates at all times. A total of 193 boilers were inspected last year (including 33 in factories located on roads outside the Western District). Among them, 107 have valid certificates. In addition, 86 have not fully met the conditions set by the engineers. Although the task of supervising boilers has not been fully achieved, there has been real progress. If the Shanghai Municipal Council had not established supervision regulations, most of the boilers that are now being inspected by engineers would not have been inspected at all.

The Shanghai Municipal Council has registered mechanical engineers. Each factory must hire an approved engineer who is responsible for installing the machinery and ensuring that it is operated in a satisfactory and safe manner. Therefore, the safety of the machinery will be guaranteed in the future, and accidents can be reduced by preventing them before they happen.

(Boiler Operator Training Class) The Industrial Department held four boiler operator training classes last year. The last class had not yet ended at the end of the year. 45 boiler operators were trained. Including the students from the previous three classes, there were a total of 153. 21 people were trained the year before, each attending 12 sessions, each session lasting two hours. The content of the course included the structure and function of steam engines. In the current class, in addition to the 45 boiler operators mentioned above, there are also 45 foremen and other personnel who manage boilers, who have been approved by the Industrial Department to attend the classes. This group training method will be further improved and will soon be implemented for other types of workers. (To be continued)

### Developing the Rich Resources of the Southwest and Northwest: Striving to Complete the Railway Network; Xiang-Gui Railway Opened to Traffic, Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Nearing Completion, Sichuan-Yunnan-Burma and Baoji-Chengdu Railways Actively Underway

The Chinese government, recognizing that the development of the rich resources of the southwest and northwest must begin with the completion of transportation infrastructure, deems railways as the most important, as large-scale freight transportation cannot be undertaken without railways. The Ministry of Communications is determined to complete railway construction with all its efforts, while simultaneously building highways to assist the railways. The details are as follows:

Northwest and Southwest Original Railways

The western part of China includes the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang in the northwest, and the five provinces of Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi in the southwest. The land area of these ten provinces is 4.92 million square kilometers, and the total population is 100 million. In terms of railways, there are currently three lines. In addition to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which was established earlier, the completion of the other two lines has also taken place in recent years. The Tongguan-Xi'an section and the Xi'an-Baoji section of the Longhai Railway, as well as the Gejiu-Bisezhai Railway, were all completed in 1936. The three lines total only 900 kilometers. In addition, there is the Northern Sichuan Railway, which is only 22 kilometers long.

Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Completed and Opened to Traffic

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was originally the western section of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway. After the failure of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway, it was shelved for 20 years. In March 1936, the Ministry of Railways, in accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session, first prepared to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, dividing it into eight surveying teams. The entire area from Chengdu to Chongqing is a rich area of Sichuan Province, with a length of 523 kilometers and requiring 50 million yuan. In addition to forming the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company to raise a capital of 20 million yuan, a loan of 34.5 million yuan was borrowed from the French banking syndicate for materials. Construction began in February of the previous year. After the outbreak of the war, orders were received to complete the project ahead of schedule. This spring, it will be open to traffic.

Planning to Build the Sichuan-Yunnan and Yunnan-Burma Railways

The new roads currently being actively planned are the two major trunk lines of Sichuan-Yunnan and Yunnan-Burma. The former runs from Xufu, Sichuan, to Kunming, Yunnan, and the latter runs from Kunming to Burma, forming a major transportation line between the Yangtze River and the Indian Ocean. The two roads are 1,500 kilometers long and are contracted by the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway Company. The company has a capital of 20 million yuan. Shen Chang is the director of the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway Engineering Bureau, and Sa Fujun is the director of the Yunnan-Burma Railway Engineering Bureau. Construction of the Sichuan-Yunnan Road has begun and is scheduled to be completed in two and a half years. The funds for the Yunnan-Burma Road are paid from the credit loan for the construction of the Guangzhou-Meizhou Railway in the British loan.

Xiang-Gui Railway Divided into Four Sections for Construction

The Xiang-Gui Railway runs from Weiyang Station on the Yuehan Railway to Guilin, Liuzhou, Yongning, Longzhou, and Zhennanguan on the border between Guangxi and Vietnam, connecting to a branch of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The entire road is 950 kilometers long and is built in four sections: Hengyang-Guilin as the first section, Guilin-Liuzhou as the second section, Liuzhou-Yongning as the third section, and Yongning-Zhennanguan as the fourth section. The Hengyang-Guilin section is 300 kilometers long and requires 36 million yuan. After one and a half years of work, it was opened to traffic on October 1 of last year. The roadbed for the remaining three sections has been completed and is scheduled to be open to traffic.

Completing the Baoji-Lanzhou and Baoji-Chengdu Lines

After the Longhai Railway reached Baoji, there were two options: to go west to Lanzhou or to go south to Chengdu. The economic value of the Baoji-Chengdu line is greater, and it is the main connecting line between the two major railway systems of the southwest and northwest. It was decided to build it first. The road is 500 kilometers long and requires 50 million yuan, which was borrowed from the Belgian bank. Since the dispatch of surveying teams in the autumn of 1936, construction will soon begin. As for the Baoji-Lanzhou line, it was decided to start construction after the Baoji-Chengdu line is completed.

Xiang-Qian Railway, Zhuzhou-Xiangtan Section

After the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company planned to change to the China Railway Company, it wanted to contract the southwest railway from Changsha via Guiyang to Chongqing to the company. Although this proposal was not realized, the Xiang-Qian Railway Engineering Bureau was established in June 1936, and it was decided to build the Zhuzhou-Xiangtan section first. The entire road is about 1,000 kilometers long and requires 160 million yuan for construction and equipment. Since the start of construction, it is not known to what extent the project has progressed. It is said that the construction of the road has been temporarily suspended due to the war.

Planning to Complete the Southwest Railway Network

The above seven lines are 5,000 kilometers long and require at least 500 million yuan. Today, the Ministry of Communications is determined to complete the five major trunk lines of Baoji-Chengdu, Chengdu-Chongqing, Sichuan-Yunnan, Yunnan-Burma, and Xiang-Gui with all its efforts. These five major trunk lines are 3,500 kilometers long. After completion, the northwest and southwest can be connected as a whole, and there will be three international channels: (1) from Kunming to Yangon, (2) from Kunming to Haiphong, and (3) from Liuzhou to Haiphong. In addition, it is planned to take Guiyang as the center, building the Sichuan-Qian Railway to the north, connecting Chongqing and Chengdu, building the Yunnan-Qian Railway to the west, connecting Qujing with Sichuan and Yunnan, building the Xiang-Qian Railway to the east, connecting Zhuzhou with Yuehan, and building the Gui-Qian Railway to the south, connecting Liuzhou with Xianggui.

Then Build the Northwest Roads

Then it was decided to take Lanzhou as the center and build the Shilanzhou section of the Longhai Road in order, connecting Shiji with Shicheng, the Baolanzhou Road from Lanzhou to Ningxia and then to Baotou, connecting with the PingSui Road, the Ganxin Road from Lanzhou via Hami and Dihua to Tacheng connecting with the Soviet railway, the Ganqing Road from Lanzhou to Xining, the Guanghan Road from Tianshui on the Longhai Road to Chengdu, connecting with the Baoji-Chengdu and Chengdu-Chongqing lines, and extending to Kangding to complete the Northwest Railway System. The above plans will be implemented step by step.

### French Cruiser Arrives in Shanghai

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that the French naval colonial cruiser "Brazza" arrived in Shanghai today (the 24th) and berthed at the French naval pontoon at 1 PM.

### Charity Lottery Drawing Advanced, Sales Break Record, Approaching January 28th Anniversary, Many Purchasers Buy Tickets in Advance

The sixth phase of the French Jiji Refugee Charity Lottery will be drawn on February 3rd, two months ahead of schedule. There are only nine days left to purchase tickets. Yesterday, this reporter passed by Nanjing Road and saw that the sales department of the lottery's general sales agent, Dagong Enterprise Company, at the Guizhou Road intersection was unusually crowded. Its door was like a market, and the enthusiastic situation of purchasing tickets before the previous drawing reappeared before my eyes. The psychology of ticket purchasers must be delayed until the day before the drawing before they go to buy tickets in a flurry in order to improve their financial luck. Therefore, curiosity arose, and when I asked someone from the company, they said that the current issue was drawn ahead of schedule because there are not many days left, and with the approach of the January 28th anniversary, the concessions will be heavily guarded, and temporary transportation will be inconvenient. Therefore, purchases are made in advance to avoid losing the good opportunity to do good and get rich. The actual sales of tickets by the company have exceeded the record compared to previous issues.

### Servant Closely Follows, Secretly Reports to Police About Robbers, One Robber Shot Dead on the Spot

A pistol and four bullets were left behind. The robber, Qiu Zhenquan, had committed many crimes. – Many robbery cases occurred yesterday. –

At around 7:30 AM yesterday, while the Jin Zhou family, living at No. 1, Alley 292, North Zhejiang Road (i.e., He Kang Li), was having breakfast, two robbers suddenly broke in. One robber, wielding a gun, threatened the people in the house and held them captive, while the other, unarmed robber, searched the rooms, stealing over 160 yuan in cash. They then called their accomplices and fled out of the house together, heading south along North Zhejiang Road and turning into North Suzhou Creek Road, hoping to escape. Unexpectedly, although the homeowner was a woman, she was extremely careful and resourceful. Taking advantage of the robbers' hasty exit, she secretly sent her servant to follow them closely. When the robbers fled to the intersection of North Suzhou Creek Road and North Xizang Road, where a Chinese police officer was stationed, the pursuer went to report the crime without making a sound. Upon receiving the information, the officer immediately drew his gun and gave chase. Suddenly hearing urgent footsteps, the two robbers quickly turned around. Seeing the police officer chasing them, they knew things were bad. The robber with the gun immediately raised it and fired two shots at the officer, but fortunately, he was not hit. The Chinese officer also quickly returned fire while chasing, firing a total of 18 shots, hitting the armed robber, who fell to the ground, shot in the head, and died on the spot. However, the unarmed robber, unfortunately, escaped into the crowd. At this time, the police department also received the alarm and quickly dispatched a large number of armed detectives to the scene to search the area, but to no avail. They then transported the dead robber's body to the morgue for examination and confiscated the self-loading pistol left behind by the dead robber, with the number N3160 and four bullets, and took them back to the police station for safekeeping. They also learned that the dead robber's name was Qiu Zhenquan, who had previously committed many crimes within the concession.

Robbery Foiled, One Robber Captured

At around 5:30 PM yesterday, six robbers suddenly went to rob a certain residential house at No. 113, Alley 727, Tiantong Road. Only one robber had a pistol, and another robber had a fake pistol. As they were about to enter the house, the female homeowner discovered them and went upstairs to lock the door, shouting for help. Seeing that the plan had failed, the robbers immediately retreated and fled out of the alley. Unexpectedly, the people in the house also chased them out, running to report to the police officer. As a result, the robber at the rear was arrested at the entrance of the alley, and a fake pistol was confiscated. They were all taken to the police station for temporary detention, and based on the information, the remaining accomplices were searched for in all directions.

Wanton Robbery, Escaping with Stolen Goods

At around 9 PM last night, six robbers suddenly came to the house of Zhao Zhou, a local woman, at No. 12, Alley 238, Avenue Poncet in the French Concession. Two robbers had pistols. After entering the house, they drove all the people in the house into one room and then wantonly robbed them. After half an hour, they each left with the stolen goods. After detailed investigation of the losses, it was found that clothing, jewelry, and cash totaling more than 300 yuan had been robbed. A list of losses was immediately prepared and reported to the police station, requesting investigation and arrest.

Carrying Remittance, Robbed on the Way

Yu Hejiang, from Tongzhou, has long worked as a senior clerk at the Hengdali Watch Store on Nanjing Road. At around 10 AM yesterday, Yu was assigned to carry 1,050 yuan in cash to the Bank of Communications on Avenue Joffre for deposit. While traveling along Rue Pu Shi, several robbers suddenly blocked his way, threatening him with guns, robbing all the cash, and fleeing in different directions. Afterwards, Yu reported to the police station in charge, requesting investigation and arrest.

### Apprentice Accuses Manager of Embezzlement

Only Relying on Empty Words with No Evidence, Clearly a False Accusation, Detained for Interrogation

Jiang Shukang, an apprentice from Haining at the Jingfeng Yarn Store on Xiamen Road, recently filed a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court against Liu Yingfu, a shareholder and manager of the store. The main points of his complaint stated that from the summer of 1934 onwards, he and Liu had jointly stolen a small portion of the yarn purchased in each large package when it was sold and sold it separately.

Embezzling in This Way

Up until the end of 1935, they obtained thousands of yuan in illegal profits. It was originally agreed to share the profits together, but Liu now occupied them alone, so he filed a complaint. However, during the court hearing, Jiang could not provide evidence to prove the facts of his complaint, only relying on empty words to claim, so the result was that the case was not accepted. Jiang was still unwilling and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. After interrogation by the High Court Branch, in addition to dismissing Jiang's

Appeal

And also because Jiang had a real suspicion of making a false accusation, even if it belonged to the facts, his behavior was a crime, then Jiang also committed a criminal responsibility, and because self-accusation cases have recently been found to have a false accusation nature, if not given appropriate punishment, it is not enough to warn efficacy, so the High Court in July of the 7th in court

Jiang was Taken into Custody

On the one hand, the Xu Dean on the 11th prepared a document along with the dossier and sent it to the Old Zha Police Station for investigation. After detailed investigation by Chinese Detective Chen Yonggui and Western Detective Smythe, and investigation to Yingchang Xintai and other yarn stores that had been dealing with Jingfeng, they could all prove that Jiang's accusation

The Facts Were Inconsistent

Therefore, Jiang was sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Court in the morning, and the police lawyers Ru Bao Yi, Li Zhi Shan, and Chen Ming explained the process and prosecuted for the crime of false accusation under Article 169 of the Criminal Law. After detailed interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, the order was given to reschedule the case for another hearing.

### Women and Newborns Accuse of Seduction and Abandonment, Demanding 6,000 Yuan in Upbringing Expenses; Defendant Denies and Files Counter-Suit for False Accusation

He Rui-tang (40 years old, native), owner of the Hetai Fruit Store at 1548 Avenue Joffre and the Futai Catering Company at 1749 Avenue Edward VII, was sued in the Criminal Division of the Special Court No. 2 by his cousin's widow, He Lin-alai (29 years old, native), acting as the legal guardian, along with her 20-day-old newborn son, represented by lawyers Wu Xiang-xian and Li Peng-cheng. She accused him of seducing her, causing her pregnancy, and then abandoning her, requesting a thorough investigation. Additionally, she filed a civil suit demanding that the defendant pay for the upbringing and education of herself and her child.

The Fostering and Educational Expenses

are set at 50 yuan per month, calculated over ten years, totaling 6,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Liao convened a court session and summoned both parties for a hearing. According to the plaintiff, He Lin-alai, she had already been seduced by the defendant while her husband was alive. After her husband's death, their interactions became more overt, with the defendant giving her irregular monthly allowances of 20 or 30 yuan. Last autumn, while she was working as a domestic helper for the Yao family on Weihaiwei Road, the defendant came and asked her to leave,

offering to take me as a concubine.

He instructed her to manage the affairs inside the new Futai store. Believing him to be sincere, she went to oversee the store's business. They cohabitated until February of this year. In May, after she became pregnant, the defendant had a dispute with his wife. He then told her to leave. Initially, he said he would rent another room for her to live in. However, after she left, he abandoned her and paid her no heed. He did not care even when she gave birth. Helpless, her younger female friends helped her

give birth in a hospital.

On the 3rd of this month, she gave birth to a boy, whom the defendant ignored. Attempts to reason with him through intermediaries were also ineffective, leaving her with no choice but to file a lawsuit. The defendant, accompanied by his defense attorney, appeared in court. He admitted to having a relationship with the plaintiff. He said she had lived in Hongkou but went to work as a domestic helper after the August 13th incident. She was dismissed by her employer for repeatedly staying out at night. She then came to him, pleading for assistance and offering to work as a servant. Out of kinship and pity for her plight,

I took her in at home,

explaining that she would be paid a wage. However, after less than a month, she began going out every night to see her younger female friends and eventually brought men into his house. Considering her improper conduct and the effect on his reputation, he dismissed her, paying her five yuan in wages. Afterward, she repeatedly came to him, forcibly demanding loans which he refused. Then, on December 4th of last year, she gathered eight men and three women, arrived in a car, and attempted to kidnap him, extorting money. He reported this to the Rue Pétain police station. The men escaped, but only the three women were apprehended and detained at the station overnight before being released. There was no

relationship with her

or any pregnancy or childbirth. It was all a malicious accusation out of spite, and he requested a thorough investigation, also filing a counter-suit for false accusation. After repeated questioning of both parties in court, the judge declared the case clear and ordered closing arguments. The verdict was set for the 28th. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were released on bail with their respective lawyers acting as guarantors, pending further notice.

### Pitiful Death of a Maid: Pregnant and Burdened While Working in Shanghai, She Suffers a Miscarriage and Dies Just Half a Month Later

Chen Cheng-shi, a 24-year-old woman from Shaoxing, came to Shanghai alone due to poverty, relying on domestic work for a living. On the 5th of this month, she was recommended to work at 343 Rue de la Gare through the Chen De-ming (39 years old, from Gaoyou) employment agency located at 18 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession. She had only been there for half a month, until the 20th. As she was four months pregnant and unable to bear the heavy work, she quit and returned to the employment agency to rest. Unexpectedly, the work had harmed her fetus, and on the afternoon of the 23rd, at 3 PM, she miscarried in the employment agency. Three hours later, she died from the complications of the miscarriage. Since the owner of the employment agency knew that she had no family or relatives in Shanghai and feared being implicated, he reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. Yesterday, a request was made to the Special Court No. 2, and Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic doctor arrived at the scene. They determined that the death was indeed caused by a miscarriage, and the body was handed over to the charity for burial, pending identification by relatives.

### Two Suicide Attempts, One Fatal, One Critical

At 4:30 AM yesterday morning, a local man in his thirties was found attempting suicide by opium in a room at the Far Eastern Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. The tea boy discovered him and reported it to the police, who summoned an ambulance to Renji Hospital. Due to severe poisoning, treatment was ineffective, and he died around 11 AM. The reason for the suicide was reportedly due to economic pressures.

A woman named Zhu Wu-shi, 44 years old, residing at 430 North Jiangxi Road, had an argument with her husband yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Afterward, feeling despondent, she secretly ingested opium in an attempt to kill herself. Discovered by her family, she was sent to the hospital. She had reportedly taken too much poison and her life was in danger.

### Fierce Monsoon Capsizes Boat at Sea

Three fishermen seek relief from the fellow villagers' association. Recent winds at sea have been frequent. Considering the current season, typhoons have long disappeared. This strong wind is likely a monsoon. Recently, near Shenjiamen in Dinghai, a fishing boat owned by a Zhou family fish merchant, carrying hairtail for sale in Shanghai, was struck by a monsoon on the morning of the 21st of this month while sailing in the waters of Dajiyan off the coast of Wusong. The boat immediately capsized. Fortunately, the three crew members were rescued by other passing ships. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday and went to the Dinghai Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, where the association arranged for them to purchase tickets to return to their hometown of Shenjiamen.

### A Review and Prospect of China’s Accounting Scholarship and Accounting Profession (Continued)

— Pan Xulun

The above-mentioned systems for both official and banking bookkeeping were modeled after Japan. The work of the Railway Accounting Uniformity Committee was led by the American Mr. H.C. Adams. Therefore, Chinese railway accounting can be said to originate from the United States. Of these reforms, the one with the greatest impact on the Chinese accounting community was banking accounting. Government agencies and railways were relatively distant from the industrial and commercial sectors, while the banking sector had very close ties with the industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, the adoption of banking accounting systems by the industrial and commercial sectors was relatively easier. Even today, we still see many industrial and commercial organizations using the voucher and journal formats commonly used in banking, which is not without reason.

Regarding accounting education, to our knowledge, in addition to the aforementioned Beijing Bookkeeping Training Institute, the Nanjing Republic University of Law and Politics established a bookkeeping class in the first year of the Republic (1912), and I myself was a student in that class. In the third year of the Republic, a bookkeeping training institute was established in Beijing. Few public and private universities had commerce departments, and even fewer were known to offer bookkeeping and accounting classes. The publication of accounting translations was also extremely rare.

From the sixth or seventh year of the Republic to the sixteenth year of the Republic, China’s accounting scholarship and accounting profession gradually developed. During World War I, the powers were preoccupied with affairs in the West, and many new-style enterprises in China, such as cotton mills and flour mills, were established. The banking industry also became more developed. In the flourishing regions of the Southeast, public and private universities and specialized schools added commerce departments due to practical needs. Examples include the establishment of the Commerce Department at Nanjing Higher Normal School (1921), the establishment of Wuchang Higher Commercial School and Shanghai College of Commerce, the establishment of the Commerce Department at China Public School Fudan University, and the Shanghai Commercial Specialized School at the secondary school level. The number of bookkeeping and accounting translations also gradually increased from 1920, and there were many excellent works, such as Yang Duanliu’s "Commercial Bookkeeping and the Theory of Accounting Units," Wu Yingtu’s "Accounting and Auditing," and Xie Lin’s "Practical Banking Bookkeeping." The application of modern accounting gradually expanded from the government, banks, railways, and other sectors to industrial and commercial enterprises. Around 1921, the Commercial Press and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company had already adopted modern accounting. Many other enterprises also adopted it, but due to limited knowledge, we were unable to investigate and list them all.

The specialized profession of certified public accountant also gradually emerged. In 1918, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of the former Northern Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Accountants, but domestic demand was not urgent, and the new system was not widely implemented. In 1921, the first accounting firm was established in Shanghai. Three years later, the Shanghai Institute of Certified Public Accountants was initiated and established in March 1925 after a year of preparation. By 1927, the Shanghai Institute of Certified Public Accountants had 57 members, but less than one-third of them were actually engaged in practice.

In summary, from the end of the Qing Dynasty to 1927, China’s accounting scholarship was fragmented by warlordism. Although large-scale enterprises were established, they declined after World War I, and their management methods were not sound. Therefore, the application of modern accounting was still very narrow. It was not until the National Government unified the country that accounting scholarship and the accounting profession experienced vigorous development. (To be continued)

### Sailboat "Sea Dragon" Prepares to Cross the Pacific

Breaking the "Thirteen" Taboo: Expedition of 3,500 Miles

The British author, traveler, and adventurer, Mr. Halliburton, plans to sail with twelve comrades across the Pacific Ocean to the United States in the sailboat "Sea Dragon" in the near future. The boat will be displayed at the San Francisco World's Fair.

The Number Thirteen

is generally regarded as unlucky by Westerners, but Mr. Halliburton boldly breaks the superstition, gathering thirteen people to undertake this adventurous endeavor. It can be said that he is extremely brave and fearless. Currently, including Mr. Halliburton, twelve people have joined, with one spot remaining for the thirteenth. Mr. Halliburton intends to find a photographer to capture the journey along the way, but as the departure date is approaching, if one cannot be found, then anyone

can join

to reach the full number. Of the eleven already joined, one is Zhang Liangqu, a shipowner with rich navigation experience. The second is Bard, who owns a sixty-foot sailboat and therefore has extensive experience as well. The third is Duray, Bard's old comrade. The fourth is Feller, an engineer who will manage the

100-horsepower

diesel engine installed on the ship. The fifth is Davis, from Honolulu, who will serve as an assistant engineer. The sixth is Peterlee, a radio operator. The seventh is Monnet, a journalist who will assist Mr. Halliburton in writing articles to fund the trip. The eighth is Baston, a graduate of the New York Conservatory of Music, who will be responsible for music and

entertainment on board.

The ninth is Heins, also a college dropout traveler. The tenth is Kaile, only seventeen years old, the youngest of the group. The eleventh is Sly, an American cook with twenty years of experience, who will prepare meals for the entire crew. The Sea Dragon is 75 feet long and weighs 80 tons,

equipped with three sails

and a diesel engine. The sails are red, yellow, and white. Each side of the hull is painted with a dragon, and the stern is painted with a phoenix, making it extremely beautiful. The interior is lavishly decorated, and for security purposes, it is equipped with three small cannons, three rifles, and two pistols,

sufficient to defend against enemies.

It has been undergoing sea trials in recent days. Although the departure date has not been determined, it is expected to be within the month. The first stop will be Keelung in northern Taiwan to replenish food and fuel before preparing for the 3,500-mile journey to Midway Island. From Midway Island to Honolulu is 1,500 miles, and from Honolulu to San Francisco is about 2,500 miles.

### Lawsuit to Confirm Marriage: Focus on the Method of Union

A couple separated due to criminal charges now contests the marital relationship

Xu Ke-min, the owner of a hardware store at 384 Weihaiwei Road, married Shen Yu-ying, a young woman from Changshu. Initially, their relationship was harmonious, and they lived together in his shop. However, their feelings soured last year, and their relationship deteriorated. Shen filed criminal charges against Xu, accusing him of rape, leading to their

separation.

Shen now resides at 100, Lane 51, Xinzha Bridge Road. She hired a lawyer and filed a civil lawsuit in the First Special District Court, seeking confirmation of their marital relationship. The court accepted the case and issued a summons, sending a bailiff to summon the defendant, Xu Ke-min, for questioning. However, people in the hardware store denied that Xu lived there. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Mo Run-hua held a hearing. The defendant,

unable to be summoned,

did not appear in court. The plaintiff, Shen Yu-ying, also did not attend, but was represented by her lawyer, who requested a postponement, stating that the plaintiff was ill. The lawyer also briefly recounted the past lawsuits between the two parties. The court then inquired about the initial method of their union. The lawyer stated that they had gone through marriage formalities, but the marriage certificate and other documents were taken away by the defendant when they lived together, so the plaintiff is now requesting confirmation of their marital relationship. Judge Mo then ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### Chauffeur of Yuan Shikai's Sixth Son Sentenced for Selling Car and Defrauding

Xu A-lin, from Haimen, a driver for the sixth son of the late President Yuan Shikai, falsely claimed to Hu Ming-chu, a driver for Tian Baixiang, a Cantonese employee of the Renji Foreign Firm on Sichuan Road, that his master's car was for sale. Hu, knowing that his employer was planning to buy a car, informed Tian Baixiang. After negotiating with Xu, they agreed on a price of 3,500 yuan in legal tender. They handed the money to Xu, who then refused to acknowledge the transaction. Tian reported this to the police, who sent detectives to arrest Xu, as well as Cao Cai-lin, who was hiding the money for Xu, and Zhao Mao-lin, who lived with Cao and introduced Xu to a lawyer. All the funds were recovered and sent to the First Special District Court. After investigation, they awaited sentencing, as previously reported. Yesterday was the date for the verdict. The police escorted Xu and the other two to the court, where Judge Dai announced the sentence. Xu A-lin was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Zhao Mao-lin was acquitted. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu immediately declared that he would appeal the Zhao Mao-lin part of the case and requested that Zhao remain in custody pending consideration during the statutory appeal period. The court then ordered Zhao Mao-lin to remain in custody during the appeal period.

### Puppet "City Government" Gang is Impoverished, Resulting in Double Salary Uproar

False Treasury Empty, Rumors Spread of Xiao-an Breaking Promises, Su Xiwu Exploits Opportunity to Stir Up Trouble and Incite Uproar

The puppet "City Government" has recently been embroiled in a dispute over demanding double salaries for the abolished Lunar New Year. As the puppet officials collectively made this request last month, the puppet "Secretary-General" Su Xiwu also joined in stirring up trouble, expressing his support. The puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiao-an was initially reluctant to refuse and promised to consider it. He even discussed and decided on a preliminary plan: generally, the lower-ranking puppet "officials" with smaller salaries would receive an additional two months' salary, for a total of three months including their original salary. The other puppet officials who had served for more than six months would receive an additional month's salary, for a total of two months including their original salary. Those who had served for less than six months would receive an additional half-month's salary, for a total of one and a half months including their original salary. However, many days have passed, and nothing has been done. The puppet officials have heard rumors that the puppet "Mayor" is using the pretext of an empty puppet "treasury" to cancel the previous agreement, so they are pressing Fu to bring up the matter again, determined not to give up until their goal is achieved. It is said that this undercurrent was stirred up by Su Xiwu to retaliate against the Fu faction for excluding members of the Su faction.

### Suicide Due to Unemployment

Judge Examines Corpse, Family Members Sign Agreement to Claim Body

Jin Fu-qing, a 31-year-old from Ningbo, was lodging with his older sister at 4 Tongchang Lane, North Jiangxi Road, Haining Road. Recently, he suffered from unemployment and economic pressure. On the 18th of this month, he went out. That night, he went to the Yuandan Hotel at 491 Edward VII Road (west end of the Great World amusement center) in the French Concession and checked into room 55. He stayed there until the night of the 21st when he suddenly had a moment of despair and secretly drank poison to commit suicide. It was not until 1:00 PM on the 2nd that the tea boy, Qu Jinyuan, urged him to get up but received no response. He forced open the door and found Jin's face pale and his mind confused. He could not speak. He immediately reported it to the French police, who sent him to Renji Hospital. He had been poisoned too severely to be saved and died at 1:00 AM yesterday. The French police took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination and sent detectives to find his family. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Special Court No. 2 and a forensic doctor arrived at the scene at noon to examine the body. They determined that Jin Fu-qing had indeed died from drinking poison. His brother-in-law, surnamed Chen, arrived, signed an agreement, and claimed the body.

### Public Bus Number 9 Crushes a Woman from the Countryside to Death

A woman surnamed Wang, about 40 years old, from 12 Kongjia Stone Bridge, Pudong, crossed the river from Pudong to Shanghai with her neighbor Chen Liugen yesterday morning. At 10:40 AM, while walking across the road at 139 Avenue Edward VII (corner of Rue du Moulin in the French Concession), from north to south, as Ms. Wang was walking on the south side of the road, a No. 9 public bus, number 15144, of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, driven by driver Yu Zixi (27 years old, from Shandong), was coming from east to west. Ms. Wang was unable to avoid it and was knocked down by the right fender of the bus. The wheel ran over her chest, killing her instantly. The police arrived, recorded the number, and reported it to the McTaggart police station. They sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination, pending notification of her family. A request was made to the court today to send personnel to inspect the scene. The transportation company also sent personnel to take photos and measurements at the scene for future investigation.

### The French Concession Police Cracked Down on Seven Gambling Dens Within Half a Day

Numerous Male and Female Offenders Arrested and Sent to Court

Not long after his release from prison, Mao Axiang, a key figure in gambling syndicates, recently exploited the unique environment of Caojiadu to establish a large gambling den. He dispatched his accomplices to set up gambling networks throughout the Special District. Gambling devices such as "listening tubes" and "shipping boats" were everywhere. Countless citizens were victimized, and many have even resorted to murder after losing heavily in gambling. Consequently, the concession authorities instructed the police to crack down severely on gambling. On the day before yesterday, between noon and 6:00 PM, Chinese detectives Liu Kunbao, Wang Wenwei, Zhang Huaiqi, Chen Tinghuai, and Zhang Jianyun from the French Concession Police, within half a day, successively raided seven gambling dens using "listening tubes" and "shipping boat" devices: (1) No. 8, Alley 222, Avenue Albert; the "listening tube" boss, Zhu Chengde, a native of Yangzhou, and his accomplice, Shuai Shunyou, a native of Taizhou, were arrested. (2) No. 27, Rue du Père Robert, Baixiang Village; the "shipping boat" boss, Wang Shisheng, a native of Wuxi, and gamblers Cai Yongfu and Madame Ma Yuan, were arrested. (3) No. 26, Baixiang Village; the "shipping boat" boss, Chen Zhiliang, a native of Ningbo, was arrested. (4) Alley off No. 16, Rue du Père Robert; the "shipping boat" boss, Zhang Yuxiang, a native of Jiangbei, was arrested. (5) No. 32, Zhicheng Fang, Rue Galle; the "shipping boat" boss, Ji Yutang, a local, was arrested.

(7) No. 6, Xinglong Street, Xujiahui Road; the "listening tube" boss, Gao Chunsheng, a native of Jiangbei, and gamblers Liu Shifu and Zhang Yousheng, were arrested. A large amount of gambling slips and cash from the seven gambling dens were confiscated and taken to the police station. Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for prosecution. Judge Zhu Chuzhe presided over the hearing. All the defendants pleaded guilty. Judge Zhu addressed the defendants, stating, "Currently, some unscrupulous individuals are exploiting the unique environment to open large gambling dens outside the concessions, endangering society. You are not afraid of facing lawsuits and are actually acting as accomplices to those evil individuals, which is extremely reprehensible." Judge Zhu announced that after a debate, Ji Yutang, Zhang Yuxiang, Wang Shisheng, and Chen Zhiliang were sentenced to four months of imprisonment for intending to profit from and engaging in public gambling. If they choose to pay a fine instead, it would be calculated at three yuan per day. Gao Chunsheng and Zhang Yuming were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment. Liu Shifu, Zhang Yousheng, Cai Yongfu, and Madame Ma Yuan were each fined four yuan.

### New Trends in Enslavement Education by the Puppet Organization in Suzhou

Plotting to Seize Private School Property, Paying Attention to Students' Hat Badges

(Suzhou Dispatch) Since Pan Zhenxiao resigned from his concurrent position as the head of the puppet "Jiangsu Education Department," Qin Mianjun, a native of Wuxi, has succeeded him. Since Qin took office in the middle of the semester, all measures have followed the old regulations, with very few innovations. Now that this semester has come to an end and the second semester is about to begin, he has specifically formulated the following methods to actively promote enslavement education. Here are a few of the key points to observe the new trends in enslavement education.

The Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government governs Wu County, Wuxi, Wujin, and other counties, which were originally areas with developed private schools. Last summer, Dongwu University and its affiliated middle school, Taowu, Yancheng, Cuiying, Huiling, Zhensheng, Shude, and Leyi in Wu County, Sixi Middle School and Jingzhi Girls' Middle School in Wuxi, and Changzhong Middle School in Wujin all moved to Shanghai and resumed classes one after another. Therefore, the Japanese Special Service Department was very displeased and sent people to visit the head of the puppet "Jiangsu Education Department" to express that the "friendship" between the Chinese and Japanese cultural circles could not be fully realized and that measures should be taken to stop it. After thinking it over again and again, Qin came up with an idea and formulated six articles of the puppet "Methods for Private Primary and Secondary Schools in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province to Apply for Resumption of Classes at the Original Site": "(1) Private primary and secondary schools registered in various counties of this province before the war should all open classes at the original site. (2) Private primary and secondary schools in various counties should apply to the county government for resumption of classes. (3) Private primary and secondary schools in various counties should submit two copies of the resumption of classes application form. (4) Private primary and secondary schools in various counties that do not open classes locally should be ordered to move back to the original site to apply for resumption of classes. (5) If private primary and secondary schools in various counties delay applying for resumption of classes, or have applied for resumption of classes but do not open classes, or do not open classes locally and do not comply with the order to move back to the original site, their school property and equipment should be investigated and kept in custody by the county government and allocated to other schools for use after being submitted to the Education Department for approval. (6) The deadline for private primary and secondary schools in various counties to apply for resumption of classes is stipulated from December 1938 to the end of March 1939. After the county governments have completed the application for resumption of classes, they should report to the Education Department for verification within one week." Judging from its intention to preserve the school property and equipment of private schools, they are bound to move back to the original site to attend classes. However, all private middle schools moved to Shanghai to attend classes, relying solely on their spirit to gain social sympathy. The school property and equipment of the past were originally not worth cherishing. The puppet organization's conspiracy only reveals its futile efforts. Since the incident in each county, string music has ceased, and many tutorial academies have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. In addition, private middle schools have also been established intermittently. All of these institutions have registered with the puppet "Education Department." Now, the puppet organization has issued orders to all counties that the recruitment of students by private tutorial academies and middle schools should be marked with the words "Approved for Establishment by the Puppet Jiangsu Education Department" or "Registered with the Puppet Jiangsu Education Department upon Verification." The puppet organization's means of educational control can be seen from this. In order to please the Japanese side, the puppet "Suzhou Education Department" pays special attention to students' hat badges. All those with anti-Japanese and national salvation words must be discarded and not used again. Recently, a special notice was issued to all counties ordering them to strictly investigate and not be negligent. Obsequiousness and servility are meticulous in order to please the Japanese, which is truly heartbreaking.

### Recent Situation of Yangzhou Middle School's Schools in Taizhou and Shanghai

Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou Middle School is one of the best middle schools in the country and enjoys a long-standing reputation. In November 1937, when Yangzhou fell into the war zone, the school suspended classes and disbanded. Some of the teachers and students fled to Shanghai, and most retreated to various counties north of the Yangtze River. Parents of students and people from all walks of life felt it was a pity that such an excellent middle school could not hold classes, so they requested and assisted the school to resume classes. Principal Zhou Houzhu consulted with the teachers and staff by letter and telegram and established two schools in Shanghai and Taixian. Zhou entrusted Huang Tai to act as the principal of the Shanghai school of Yangzhou Middle School, and Ji Naiquan to act as the principal of the Taixian school of Yangzhou Middle School. Both schools have now resumed classes for more than one semester, each with more than 500 students in eleven grades. The teachers are all excellent teachers from Yangzhou Middle School. All aspects of administration, teaching, and discipline management are based on Zhou's spirit of rigorousness and diligence in running Yangzhou Middle School for more than ten years, so the school spirit is very disciplined and valued by all parties.

### Heroic Sacrifice

— Zhi Xibai

— In Memory of My Late Friend, Lu Jixian, on the Anniversary of His Death

A swarm of airplanes hovered in the sky above the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway, "Pa pa..." bursts of machine-gun fire, "Boom boom boom..." the explosions of bombs shook the houses, rivers, and trees of Zhaoxiang: windowpanes rattled, ripples spread across the water, and withered leaves fluttered.

Boats in the river passed one after another, each boatman using double the strength, his face tense, showing extreme panic.

"The army has reached Sheshan!" Someone ran breathlessly into Fuxing Garden, reporting the alarming news to the crowd. All the tea drinkers in the garden trembled, their faces turning pale.

"Let's go! Are we staying to die?" The crowd scattered, and a violent commotion broke out in Zhaoxiang Town. Men, women, old, and young all rushed home.

"But where can we go? We won't be able to live." The same serious question emerged in everyone's mind.

Lu's house was filled with frightened people.

Indeed, Mr. Lu was the guiding light of Zhaoxiang. He could point out the path that the people of Zhaoxiang should take, no matter the time.

"The time has come when we must leave. The able-bodied men should gather their weapons and put the elderly, women, and children on the boats to leave first. We young people will take care of things from behind. We can only survive by going around Qingpu." Mr. Lu said sternly and directly to the crowd, explaining why they had to do so.

In the afternoon, everything was prepared. More than a dozen large boats were filled with men, women, old, and young, as well as simple luggage and a small amount of food. The weapons of Zhaoxiang Town were placed on one of the boats in the middle, guarded by six strong men. Each boat was covered with a grass shed to prevent enemy bombing.

The boats set sail. More than a dozen boats connected into a long snake. Mr. Lu's family was at the end, because Mr. Lu was prepared to deal with any incident, allowing the remaining boats to pass unhindered.

The boats slowly moved westward, the silhouette of Zhaoxiang gradually disappearing from the view of the people of Zhaoxiang.

When the boats reached outside the east gate of Qingpu, only two or three li away from the Song-Qing Road, a gunshot suddenly rang out from behind, followed by the sound of "docking the boat," like the roar of a beast.

Mr. Lu waved his hand, signaling the boats in front to keep moving forward, that he would withstand everything, and that he would never forget the weapons on the boat for the people of Zhaoxiang.

"Dock the boat!" Another roar, and Mr. Lu's boat had to land.

"Who are you?"

"..." Mr. Lu did not answer. He did not understand what the other party was.

"I'm asking you, who are you?"

"I am Chinese!" When Mr. Lu clearly saw that the person asking the question was Chinese and that the steel helmet was inlaid with a circular red badge, he said straightforwardly. He understood that surrender was shameful, and that it was better to die with honor than to live in disgrace. Fortunately, the crowd had accelerated their advance, and at most, only his family would be sacrificed.

"Damn it, who doesn't know you're Chinese! Who are you?"

"I am Lu Jixian!"

"What do you do?"

"I am Chinese, born in modern China, doing what China needs to be done."

"Arrest him!" The other party was ashamed and angry.

"No need to arrest me, I'll get up myself!" Mr. Lu climbed ashore.

"..." The other party had no words.

"Who are you? Aren't you Chinese? What are you doing? If 500 million Chinese people all worked for their own country, how could the barbarians behind you have broken into this place?" Mr. Lu questioned them fiercely, as if giving a speech to the crowd.

A group of barbarian beasts widened their eyes and mumbled urgently for a while, then waved their hands, indicating that they were impatient and should start.

The questioner raised a shiny bayonet, but Mr. Lu calmly stretched out his neck, ready to be dealt with.

"Speak! Are there any troops ahead?" "Yes! A lot of them, they've been waiting for you for a long time. They're going to welcome you with machine guns and hand grenades!"

"Are you not telling the truth?"

"I am telling the truth! Do you think I'm the same as you? You really insult me."

With a "whoosh!" the shiny bayonet slashed across Mr. Lu's face, and then Mr. Lu's glasses slipped from the bridge of his nose to the ground, and bright red blood dripped from Mr. Lu's left cheek.

With a "shick!" the bayonet flashed again, and blood also flowed from Mr. Lu's right cheek.

"Do you recognize this guy?"

"Recognize him! Not long after, this guy will fall into the hands of our army and become a driving force for national rejuvenation!" Saying that, Mr. Lu raised his eyebrows. He felt his cheeks were a little hot.

"Bang!" Mr. Lu fell to the ground in response, his feet stretching and contracting non-stop, but his eyes were wide open, shouting "Long live the Republic of China! Down with ×× Imperialism! Kill all traitors!..."

"Bang!" Another sound, and Mr. Lu was silent.

The water of Sanliu River was flowing silently, shedding tears; Jiuxue lowered its head to show sorrow. On the ground, the broken lenses of the glasses were flashing brightly, symbolizing the final glory.

### Good News Comes With Each Year, The Military Camp Seems New With Each Passing Season

— Ci Kai

### "Inspiration"

— Qiu Zhen

The Soviet writer M. Zoshchenko, in his "How I Write," says:

"...I have two methods of working. One method is: whenever I have inspiration, I write with creative impulse. At this time, the work progresses lightly and without flaws. The entire picture, the entire structure of things, is naturally formed.

"The second method is when there is no inspiration. When I encounter such a situation, I write with technical training. In this method of working, I do what is usually done by the subconscious: I build the plan of the theme myself, I properly dispose of each paragraph and each word, and develop the story from the word..."

However, he later further said, "It (inspiration) is the only essential element for a writer, for all the work of a writer. Technique can certainly help inspiration, supplement the lack of inspiration; it can also replace inspiration—with technique, one can eventually avoid lowering one's own quality; however, if there is never any kind of inspiration, that writer will certainly not be able to achieve profound progress."

The reason why "inspiration" is an indispensable element in literary writing is not only for the convenience of writing—generally speaking, writing with the impulse of inspiration is indeed lighter and more satisfactory; but also because literature and art must contain moving emotions in the expression of images. It borrows the image, passes through sensibility, and then turns into recognition. The creation written by the writer's recognition accompanied by emotion can give the reader "resonance" and produce the effect of literature and art. If there is no real emotion, then no matter how correct the writer's worldview is, how skilled the technique is, what he writes is at most a description of principles, a depiction of images, it is always dead, and has no infectiousness. The so-called "formulaism" and the so-called "eight-legged essay," in addition to the problems of technique, the author's lack of inspiration is also a major reason.

Then what is "inspiration"? Zoshchenko believes that "inspiration is a happy combination of physical health, mental strength, lively nerves and firm self-confidence, a combination that throws all one's abilities into one place—in one occasion—in literature."

This explanation is not very clear. I think that "inspiration" is the combination of cognition and emotion, that is, the impulse of consciousness. It is by no means the ethereal holy spirit falling from the sky that is generally misunderstood, but a spiritual state produced in the practice of life and in contact with things. Therefore, inspiration is also a product of reality. Without reality, it is hollow and hypocritical.

From this point of view, writers don't have to worry about not having inspiration. As long as you go to contact reality, to experience life, to go deep into the society you want to describe to practice, to understand, then, followed by your correct worldview or cognition, there will surely be many different situations of righteousness. To pursue and grasp inspiration in this way and write, can you write truthfully, infectiously, and resonate with the entire readership.

It is ultimately coercive to write only with knowledge and themes without digesting them, because although this is not necessarily a game of words, it still fails to achieve the reality of literature and art. Writers should return the cognition to the phenomenon, return the themes to reality—that is, to practice life, so that cognition and themes are tempered and melted by the emotions from which they arise, and embodied as the true inspiration before writing, this is good.

Of course, if a person already has such inspiration, it will be easier to succeed in writing. I hope they can write boldly and more.

### Unofficial Biographies of the Righteous People of Jiangyin

— Zou Xiao

——National Novels

Yang Fei has already introduced the thoughts in this book "Unofficial Biographies of the Righteous People of Jiangyin" (written by Hu Shanyuan, a total of sixteen short stories, published by World Book Company, four corners) in the eighth issue of "Black Tea". Now I want to try to explore the techniques or artistry of this book.

The materials on which the author is based are all included in the appendix, which allows us to compare and see clearly the hard work the author has put in. The simpler seems to be using Ming Zhu Chunyu's "Jiangyin Hou Lu" and Qing Ji Liuqi's "Huang Yuqi's Uprising in Zhutang" to write "Huang Yuqi", using "Tianxiang Pavilion Random Notes" to write "Hu Zhixue", "Xu Wu" and "Li Jieli", and using "Yuchu New Records" to write "Qi Sanlang". More effort was spent writing "Xu Yong", "The Ji Brothers", "Cheng Bi", "Wang Hua", "Old Man Tang San", "Chen Xianqin" and "Xu Yuyang" from Qing Han Tan's "Records of Jiangyin City Defense", Qing Xu Chongxi's "Post-Records of Jiangyin City Defense" and Qing Shen Tao's "Jiangshang Relics" and other articles, with the main focus as follows: June 1st and 2nd (Xu Yong and the Ji brothers), 15th (Cheng Bi), July 12th and 29th (Old Man Tang San), 20th to 27th (Xu Yuyang), August 2nd (Wang Hua), 8th (Chen Xianqin). However, "Old Man Tang San" and "Tang Surname Boy" are not necessarily father and son. Twisting them together is more interesting. This is a bold and clever place for the author, because novels are ultimately not trustworthy history and do not need to be weighed so carefully. Although the Wugeng Tune, Persuasion Song and Answer Song added in the "Xu Yong" article are drafted by the author, they are much more interesting than a single sentence.

The most complex and large are the three articles "Huang Mingjiang", "The He Brothers" and "Chen Erlang". The name Huang Mingjiang comes from legend, so everyone says different things. "Records of Jiangyin City Defense" and "Jiangshang Relics" write Huang Mingjiang, "Post-Records" and "Lu Qiao Records" write Huang Yunjiang, and "Tianxiang Pavilion Random Notes" write Wang Yungang, with three completely different characters. The author considered the time between them, weaved these five types of text together, and also made interesting couplet-style dialogues, which took a lot of painstaking effort. The He brothers are He Chang and He Tai. The author cleverly pulled the "two brothers" from "The Southern History of the Late Ming Dynasty" and put them on the heads of the He brothers. Although "Chen Erlang" is from "A Grand View of Anecdotes from the Ming and Qing Dynasties", many anecdotes after the city was destroyed are cleverly organized together. The opening quote of a section about people hiding in the Buddha hall in "The Oral Account of a Refugee", and the middle section inserts two tragic facts (female corpse shadows and naked women with arrows, both seen in Tianxiang Pavilion Random Notes) through Chen Erlang's play, even if they are seen through Chen Erlang's eyes, also took a lot of thought.

In my personal opinion, I think the following articles should be the highlight of the entire book, namely: "Old Man Tang San", "Chen Xianqin", "The He Brothers" and "Chen Erlang". On the one hand, the story itself is the most stimulating, and on the other hand, it is due to the author's skillful technique. "Old Man Tang San" is written as hot as fire, as interesting as reading Water Margin or Three Kingdoms. In the "Chen Yiqin" section, the author deliberately plays tricks. Although he does not explicitly state who the underwater assassin is, the reader already knows that this is Chen Xianqin. Moreover, according to unofficial history, this assassin is not necessarily Chen Xianqin. The author's vague writing just does not contradict unofficial history. "The He Brothers" almost entirely use the analogy of the Qianzhuang dialect to compare fighting against the Qing soldiers. The language is wonderful and it is indeed a rare good article. The nine-year-old "Chen Erlang" is written very cutely, just like a child's actions and tone, and Arida's ignorance of the joy between people is also portrayed in detail.

What is regrettable is "Yan Dian Shi". This supporter of the Jiangyin City Guard does not have a novel. Although he is Chu Dian Shi, he is also a "righteous person" of Jiangyin. He cannot be stripped of his qualifications as a commoner because he became an official; moreover, he had already retired and only became a Dian Shi because he was supported by the people. Also, there are no female resistance fighters; for example, Huang Yuqi's wife's repeated suicide attempts are good material. But this is inevitable nitpicking.

(Note) Huang Yuqi's daughter-in-law repeatedly tried to commit suicide. Her suicide seems to have been to die for her husband, not to resist the Manchus. The author did not write about her, perhaps because of this.

### Mother's Joy

— Zhe Hen

——Presented to my brother who is far away on the battlefield

When you are on the battlefield, with the moonlight and winds fading and the wilderness everywhere, and you miss your mother and want to return home, please remember this sentence: "Without national freedom, there is no mother."

Mother's tears are an expression of her love, pity, and concern for you, but don't be saddened by this, because mother's tears are the needle of happiness. If we are suppressed under the enemy's iron hooves, there will be days when we want to cry but have no tears.

The wrinkles on mother's face are deepening day by day, mother's body is as thin as a reed, and mother's cheeks are becoming drier day by day... If you remember these things, then you should be motivated, pick up your gun, fix your bayonet, and kill all the enemies. Bring back a little blood for your mother to drink heartily, and fatten up the reed-like mother.

Now it's cold, and mother always likes to bathe in the stream of daylight, to get a little warmth. If the days become overcast, then you should raise your clenched fist and tear open the smoky cloud curtain, let the blue sky and the white sun shine red on the earth.

Your youth, your happiness, your joy, your wisdom, your future, your light, your ambition... and everything you have! Don't lose it in your mother's tears.

In her spare time, mother often talks about the story of Yue Fei. How she admires Yue Wumu's loyalty and bravery! If you want to win your mother's joy, then you should prepare your banners and drums, and on the open-air stage under the spark of freedom, go and perform the story of Yue Fei!

On the day when the national people celebrate the victory of the all-out war of resistance, you, wearing the crown of freedom and glory, return. When you walk to the loving arms of your mother, who is standing on the dock and looking forward to her beloved son's triumphant return, you should smile and say, "Mother! Your beloved son has returned with freedom."

### It's Best If You Don't Think

— Lu Gong

It's best if you don't think,

Of that beautiful hometown,

It has now been destroyed,

And turned into a graveyard.

The fields have long been uncultivated,

The sickle in the tiles is full of yellow flowers,

That old house of more than ten years,

Only a few pillars remain, leaning east and west.

Having been exiled for thousands of miles to this day,

You can forget your small hometown,

Move forward, I advise you,

There is a new world ahead.

### Finance: Japanese Banks Suddenly Aggressively Settle Foreign Exchange

Hong Kong Sassoon Has Supply, Once Loosened, Then Reported Softening

Yesterday, there were many settlements by British and American foreign firms in the foreign exchange market, along with aggressive absorption by Japanese banks, which led to a tightening of the situation. Although Hong Kong Telecom and Sassoon provided mutual supply in the middle, tending to loosen, they ultimately could not hold for long due to insufficient supply to meet demand. There were slight fluctuations throughout the day, and the volume of transactions was quite active.

In the early morning, the London large bar was close to a further reduction, the New York silver price did not move, and there was no change in the London gold. The exchange rate was 3.7% against the US dollar, 10 French centimes against the French franc, and 1.25 against Shanghai. The US dollar rose 25 against the British pound, fell 1.25 against the French franc, and was one dime larger against Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. At the bank's early opening, the spot selling price was 8 pence 421875 for British exchange and 16.40625 yuan for US exchange, compared to the previous close, British exchange was flat and US exchange was 0.03125 yuan higher. After opening, British American Tobacco Company settled spot US exchange through Banque Belge pour l'Etranger and Citibank, initially at 16.4375 yuan, then only at 375. In addition, foreign firms also absorbed spot British exchange from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Banque de l'Indochine at 8 pence 421875, then gradually softened to 8 pence 406825. There was no change in the announcement of the HSBC listing and the silver equalization tax. After that, foreign telegrams indicated that Hong Kong and Sassoon successively sold spot British exchange to American banks Banque Belge pour l'Etranger and Banque de l'Indochine at 8 pence 4375 and US dollars at 16.4375 yuan. In addition, money changers also sold spot Hong Kong exchange to the Dutch banks Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij and Banca d'Italia at 57 yuan and 56.875 yuan. Therefore, the situation turned hard. The afternoon closing price was 8 pence 421875 for British exchange and 16.40625 yuan for US exchange.

In the after-market, the situation remained loose at first because the selling intentions of Hong Kong Telecom and Sassoon were not weak. They also sold spot British exchange to HSBC at 8 pence 4375 and US dollars to the Dutch bank Maclaine Watson at 16.4375 yuan. Afterwards, a certain bank suddenly bought spot US exchange from Chinese banks at only 16.375 yuan. In addition, Japanese banks also began to settle through Banque Belge pour l'Etranger at 16.375 yuan, and also bought spot British exchange from Banca d'Italia and Banque de l'Indochine at only 8 pence 390625. Furthermore, Banca d'Italia and the Dutch bank absorbed Hong Kong exchange from money changers at 16.875 yuan. Therefore, the underlying trend tightened. The evening closing selling price at banks was 8 pence 40625 for British exchange and 16.375 yuan for US exchange, resulting in British exchange softening by 0.015625 and US exchange being unchanged compared to the previous close, and Hong Kong exchange loosening slightly by 0.125.

### Discount Rate Set

Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange draft bills stopped falling and leveled off, fluctuating around 35 yuan per thousand packages throughout the day. The final price was 35.25 yuan, the same as the previous day's closing price.

### Large Bar Near Distant Reduction

London telegram on the 23rd: Speculators sold a small amount, and the market stabilized. The market continued to be calm after closing. The near-term of the large silver bar remained unchanged, and the distant-term was reduced by 0.0625. New York silver telegram: the US silver price remained unchanged with no market. Bombay silver telegram: The Indian silver market was calm, and there were no changes in spot and near- and far-term futures.

### Most Foreign Currencies Rise

Yesterday, British pure gold was unchanged, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 25. Foreign exchange settlements were very active, and foreign telegram supply was eager. Supply and demand were still balanced, and the market price hovered with a slight softening trend. Local merchants still sold more, but Hong Kong merchants were sluggish in absorbing. The market price fluctuated very narrowly, with a slightly soft trend. There were few transactions in the association. Zhenmao sold 50 British gold pounds to Yongtai, Huitong sold 50 British gold pounds to Yongtai, and Qintai sold 500 US dollar bills to Tongfeng. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pound rose by 1 dime, British gold bill rose by 2 cents, US dollar pound rose by 1 dime, US dollar bill rose by 1.5 cents, French franc bill rose by 1 li, Singapore dollar bill rose by 1 cent, Canadian dollar bill rose by 4 cents, Philippine dollar bill rose by 1 cent, and other currencies were unchanged.

### Major Investors Watch, Gold Market Stagnant

Fixed at 2009 Yuan

Yesterday, the cash raw gold after-hours market conditions suddenly turned into a dull stalemate, with no excitement at all, lingering at 2,009 yuan all day long. Generally, major investors were mostly on the sidelines, aiming to observe the changes in the European situation. Although Hong Kong merchants secretly continued to collect in the middle, the number was limited, only about a hundred taels. Moreover, the local silver shops and money exchange businesses successively dumped and sold a considerable amount, causing the market price to eventually fall by three yuan. Everyone's mood was calm, and there were very few transactions. Silver shop jewelry gold did not change, and customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also remained unchanged.

Since the morning, each bar of ten taels opened initially because it was heard that foreign exchange opened, and Hong Kong telegraph and Western merchants vigorously dumped, tending to loosen. The price was then called down from 2012 yuan to 09 yuan, before transactions were seen. First, a money exchange business made 50 taels, with a price of 2009 yuan as the opening price. Then, a certain silver shop (on behalf of Hong Kong merchants) advanced 50 taels each from money exchange businesses and colleagues, at the same price. Later, a gold firm advanced 50 taels from silver shops, also at 09 yuan. After that, the potential of foreign exchange was quite stable, causing the market to suddenly turn stagnant. Transactions were still not seen until noon. Therefore, the noon closing price was the same as the morning opening. It was heard that after closing, a certain money exchange business sold 50 taels to a colleague, also at 09 yuan. In the afternoon, the market situation became even more dull. At first, only money exchange businesses mutually made 50 taels, still at 09 yuan. Later, because it was heard that foreign exchange was being vigorously pulled back by Japanese banks and weakened, sellers mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Transactions were still not seen until after 4 o'clock, so the evening closing price was still 2009 yuan, a decrease of three yuan compared to the previous day. The selling price of spot gold from cash firms was 2020 yuan, and the buying price was 2005 yuan. The current premium gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were no transactions.

Silver shop jewelry gold, per tael for exchange, did not change due to the fixed price of raw gold. Da Tong Hang and Lao Qing Yun and others still hung the original price of 204 yuan, while Xin Tong Hang hung 202 yuan, and the buying price was 196 yuan.

Pure Gold Has Stopped Rising and is Trending Flat

London, 23rd - London pure gold per ounce did not change because people's hearts had turned stable due to the British pound returning to growth. The calculation is still £7, 8 shillings, 8 and a half pence. Therefore, the listed price of the central bank also remained unchanged. The buying price of Chinese pure gold (raw gold) is also still 1213 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed price of customs gold is still calculated at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, 9 li. The Shanghai standard premium gold price is also still hanging at 1209 yuan, 2 jiao.

### Securities London Foreign Debt Has a Quote But No Market

But Prices are Continuing to Rise, Domestic Debt is Still Shrouded in Selling Pressure

The listed market price of London Chinese foreign debt on the 23rd of this month (Monday) has again entered a state of stagnation with quotes but no market. Various bonds have generally risen by one or two pounds. The Anglo-German renewed loan, Anglo-French bond coupons, and Crisp loan have each risen by one pound. The former is priced at 73 pounds, and the latter is priced at 34 pounds. The Vickers aircraft bond coupons have shrunk back by half a pound, priced at 12 and a half pounds. Railway bonds, such as Daokow-Singiang Railway, Hukuang Railway, and Shanghai-Nanking Railway, have each risen by two pounds. The Daokow-Singiang Railway bond is priced at 23 pounds. The non-German-issued Hukuang Railway bond coupon is priced at 22 pounds, and the German-issued bond coupon is priced at 20 pounds. The Shanghai-Nanking Railway bond is also 22 pounds. The Kowloon-Canton Railway bond has risen by one and a half pounds, priced at 18 and a half pounds. The original and renewed bond coupons of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway have each risen by one pound, and the market price is 16 pounds. The supply and demand of spot goods in London are still quite lively. It is heard that 10,000 pounds of Anglo-French bond coupons of the British Gold Rehabilitation Loan are being sold, and the selling side is very firm and demanding a tight price. There are also German-issued bond coupons being sold at a selling price of 45 pounds and 15 shillings, slightly lower than last week by five shillings. At the same time, the buying side is also interested in 2,500 pounds, offering only 43 pounds and 2 and a half shillings. It seems difficult for both sides to agree. There is also 1,500 pounds (i.e., 7,500 US dollars) of the French-American 5% bond coupon, higher by half a pound. As for railway bonds, the supply and demand are also quite strong. 2,000 pounds of the non-German-issued Hukuang Railway bond coupon have been sold at a selling price of 23 and a half pounds, raising the price by one and a half pounds according to the market. However, 2,500 pounds of the drawn bond coupon of the said bond are being sought, offering 23 pounds, raising the price by one pound according to the market. 2,000 pounds of the German-issued undrawn bond coupon of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway renewed loan have been sold at a selling price of 17 pounds, raising the price by one pound according to the market. 1,000 pounds of the Daokow-Singiang Railway bond have been sold at a selling price of 25 pounds, raising the price by two pounds according to the market. 5,000 pounds of the Kowloon-Canton Railway bond have been sold at a selling price of 19 pounds, raising the price by half a pound according to the market. It is heard that the old price of the Kowloon-Canton Railway bond market is 16 and a half pounds, and the old price of the Vickers aircraft bond coupon market is 13 pounds and 15 shillings.

The listed market price of London British Far East companies' stocks on the 23rd of this month (Monday) has changed very little. The shares of the Mercantile Bank of India and China have fallen by two and a half shillings, priced at 8 pounds and 17 and a half shillings. The bearer shares of the Kailan Mining Administration have continued to fall by six pence, priced at 16 shillings and three pence.

The after-hours market for securities yesterday gradually developed a downward trend from weakness. The previous sharp decline failed to see a rebound after the announcement of the measures, which is enough to show the lack of enthusiasm. After several fluctuations, it gradually declined. It should not have this phenomenon as the interest payment period approaches. It is only because the general public is somewhat dissatisfied with this new measure, and merchants, who only seek profit, have started selling off in droves. But this will ultimately be a temporary phenomenon, and the future of the entire public debt is still optimistic. The market price was stable at the beginning of yesterday's session, but then scattered bulls and Xie Da Company successively came out or sought to sell, causing the market price to be unstable and repeatedly decline. Trading was light in the afternoon. No. 10 sold Class A, B, and C, and No. 11 sold small amounts. Throughout the day, although trading was not very active, the trend was completely shrouded in selling pressure, with high pressure all around, and it was not easy to recover for a while. As a result, market prices uniformly declined, ranging from one and a half jiao to eight and a half jiao. The total number of transactions was estimated to be more than 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading is still not enthusiastic, and various prices seem to have gradually become firm. Several shares of the Hua Cheng Tobacco Company were traded yesterday at a price of 22 yuan, which is slightly firmer than before.

### Cocoons are Shipped to Hamburg: Another Material Among Military Supplies

Raw silk cocoons are also a newly invented use among military supplies. Since August 13th, approximately from November of the 26th year, more than 20,000 tons of dry cocoons have been shipped to Germany to date (equivalent to more than 340,000 dan according to the old scale). Before the transportation was completed, another 214 tons of dry cocoons were shipped to Hamburg, Germany yesterday by a British steamer, and the quality of the cocoons was not allowed to be pressed or folded, for fear of damaging the silk quality, because they are for military use.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculation is Prevalent in the Spot Yarn Market, Double Horse Yarn is Actually Seen as the Standard. 75% of All Transactions are Done by Fellow Merchants, and the "Rubber Ball" Trade in Japanese Yarn is Still Quite Lively

The yarn market is stable as usual, and customers from South China and Yunnan are still accepting coarse and fine yarns quite well. Merchants from Hong Kong also come to purchase, which makes people more determined. However, other regions are still stagnant and weak, and there is no news of any action in eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, the selling price of spot yarn has not been able to rise much, and the increase is more peaceful. Some yarn prices have even weakened due to poor sales. However, the 20s Double Horse yarn produced by Shenxin No. 9 Factory is extremely popular, and non-industry people and financial circles are hoarding it extremely enthusiastically. Some people are even buying it at a premium, which shows how strong their interest is. The reason why hoarders only collect the Double Horse yarn brand is because it is selling well on the market, and there is a market price every day. In addition, the factory ships a lot of goods, and the sales channels for customers are also wide. Once there are changes, it is easy to enter and exit without being hindered. Therefore, people who are thinking of speculation treat it as a standard.

Checking the situation of the spot yarn market, the momentum at the beginning of the morning session was flat. However, banks were commissioning huge amounts of Double Horse warehouse orders, but the opening price was not much different from the previous day. Customer sales were also not strong, and the spot price was actually opened 1.5 yuan lower. After a while, the collection by fellow merchants became more enthusiastic, and Hong Kong merchants also put in bids for Double Horse spot goods, turning to rise. After that, the price was uneven in the middle, fluctuating between one and two yuan. Until closing, Double Horse yarn rose again, closing at 404 yuan. Checking the Double Horse warehouse orders, they were very popular, with 550 bales traded. In addition, 700 bales of Inu Musume and Double Horse spot warehouse orders were also traded, which shows that speculative trading is very active in the market. 2,235 bales were traded in the morning, with fellow merchants accounting for three-quarters and customer transactions accounting for 555 bales. In terms of prices, 20s Double Horse yarn rose by 2 yuan compared to the previous day, Inu Musume was flat, Double Globe rose by 3 yuan, Te Jin Cheng was flat, and 10s coarse yarn rose by 1 or 2 yuan. Only 10s Double Globe rose by 4 yuan. It is heard that Chongxin Factory launched 3,000 bales of 20s Da Fa at a price of 390 yuan to 405 yuan, spot price, and February-March futures were sold out. The amount bought by each region is listed on the left.

The situation in the Japanese yarn market is still sluggish as before, with very slow actual demand. There is no business in any region, so the market price is bleak and weak. Only the "rubber ball" trade in this month is still quite lively. The spot price of 20s Mizutsuki yarn is 317 yuan to 6 yuan, and the price for this month is 316 yuan to 15 yuan. The spot price of 20s Blue Phoenix yarn is 313 yuan to 12 yuan, and the price for this month is 301.5 yuan to 07 yuan.

80 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 30 bales to Amoy, 360 bales to Swatow, 120 bales to Hong Kong, 90 bales to Haikou, 160 bales to Beihai, and 800 bales to Haiphong today for export.

Because the inventory of native cotton is very thin and the arrival of goods is becoming increasingly rare, the price of native cotton is rising day by day, while the price of foreign cotton is decreasing daily. Therefore, trade has been very lively recently. Even the cotton firms have purchased a large amount. Yesterday, in terms of Chinese factories, Shenxin again imported 2,000 bales of Indian cotton, 1,000 bales of Brazilian cotton, and 2,000 bales of American upland Sinter. The price delivered to the factory was 71 yuan. Chongxin also imported 2,000 bales of American upland Sinter. Tongcheng Company imported a total of 2,000 bales of White Rock and Omera. The price delivered to the dock was 71 yuan and 65 yuan. There were also other cotton firms that imported more than 2,000 bales of Indian cotton. The amount of transactions and prices are listed below.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Market Stalemate

Difficult to Break for the Time Being

Yesterday, the spot price of silk in New York, Japanese silk 83 cents up 4 cents, 75 cents up 3 cents, Shanghai silk 78 cents and Guangdong silk each up 2 cents. Lyon Japanese silk up 1.50 francs, Shanghai silk A up 1.50 francs, B up 1 franc. The futures market price on the exchange slightly rebounded by half a cent to two and a half cents. Yokohama spot futures rose by two to three yuan.

The white factory silk trade of foreign firms in this port is still firm, and the purchasing interest of users and hoarders also seems to be satisfied. Because the price of silk has risen too quickly and the distance from overseas market prices is too far, it also makes people dare not be too optimistic. The dry cocoon price was sold at 330 yuan yesterday, and cocoon merchants have already discussed the price to more than 350 yuan, which is equivalent to a silk cost of nearly 1400 yuan. Recent forecasts for the silk market are that it is temporarily impossible to break the deadlock. Foreign firms only had Indian silk transactions yesterday. Users first absorbed and purchased factory silk of good brands, and then asked for lower prices. The total transaction volume was 30 dan. 193 pieces of Huzhou silk were transported to Europe yesterday.

### Large Quantities of Tea are Transported to Europe

In the tea market of foreign firms in this port, Yongxing, Jardine Matheson, and Xiehe and other firms have transacted more than 340 boxes of Fine Eyebrow tea, all of which are high and middle-grade goods. The highest selling price was 145 to 173 yuan, and the lowest was 802 to 805 yuan. Although there are still more than 4,600 pieces of samples on display, the number of fast-selling goods such as high and middle-grade Fine Eyebrow Pearl Tea is relatively rare. The inventory of low-grade goods such as Needle Eyebrow and Elegant Eyebrow is relatively abundant. Therefore, various foreign firms still intend to suppress prices. 212 tons of tea were transported to Europe yesterday, and 100 pieces of tea bricks were transported from Hong Kong.

Due to the uncertain trend of the European political situation, the foreign cotton market price caused a sharp drop in securities. The cotton market was also depressed by this blow. Regarding government loans for cotton, the Ministry of Agriculture has submitted another suggestion to the government, stipulating that the method is to reward those who are willing to abandon cotton fields and not plant them, and the amount of cotton they should receive can be allocated from a portion of the government's loan cotton. This method can reduce the production of new cotton and reduce the government's cotton reserves. The government may have hope of implementing it. Yesterday, New York fell by ten British pence, India, including forecasts, fell by two rupees, and Egypt Liverpool fell by two or three pounds sterling. The exchange rate rose slightly yesterday, and the legal currency price of cotton all fell. American cotton and Brazilian cotton each fell by more than 1 yuan and 2 jiao per dan, while Indian cotton and Kampuchea cotton fell by more than 1 yuan.

### Seafood: Swatow Golden Hook Shrimp Tails

Sold as Soon as They Arrive, Kylin Vegetables are Stable

Swatow Golden Hook Shrimp Tails arrived yesterday, and the goods are still good and were immediately sold out. The higher ones were 95 yuan, and the lower ones were 90 yuan. The trend is stable, sales can be said to be good, and the market is stable. Yesterday, West Orchid vegetables sold for 20 yuan and 5 jiao, and Dragon Tooth vegetables for 19 yuan.

### Arrivals are Declining, Native Cotton Transactions are Tax-Reduced, Cotton Firms are Switching to Foreign Cotton

The native cotton business is still scarce, but the selling price is firmly constant. The flower shops are still constantly buying and selling white-packaged cotton, but the factories have never purchased it. Japanese factories have no action at all, and all transactions are done by fellow merchants. The amount is limited, and the number of carriers is even smaller. In fact, arrivals from all sides are declining, and the inventory on the market is scarce. Under this environment, Chinese and foreign factories have no choice but to purchase foreign cotton to make up for the situation. Therefore, the purchase of Indian cotton has been increasing day by day. The cotton firms, seeing the chaotic situation in the mainland and the gradual depletion of cotton stocks in the cotton-producing areas, have changed their principles and are trading in American and Indian cotton. The source of supply in the Subei area is still quite abundant. 3,777 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the dock. 50 bales of cotton were exported to Swatow, 520 bales to Hong Kong, and 80 bales to Beihai. In addition, 1,200 bales of cotton came from Haimen, and 310 bales of cotton came from Baimao. The amount of spot cotton traded and the market price are listed on the left.

### Piece Goods: Renamed Japanese Goods are Mixed with Domestic Cloth and Shipped to Hong Kong

The Su Lun Factory that was Seized is Shipping Goods to Shanghai for Sale

National Cloth: As yarn prices rise, domestic cloth hoarders choose to hoard cheaper goods, and the financial circles are also quite interested. However, except for merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan, spot sales are generally weak. The price of colored cloth and fancy goods is particularly firm and high, while the market price of white goods is chaotic. Small amounts are cheaper than wholesale. Swatow merchants telegraphed that local rumors are very rampant, and each shipment is handled slowly, but the goods that need to be sold urgently are still being shipped. After the price increase of Yihuo coarse cloth, small amounts of spot goods on the market are 1-2 jiao cheaper according to the market. Nearly 100 pieces have been purchased by this street and merchants from Ningbo. Hong Kong merchants continue to purchase fine twill of domestic goods. 30-40 pieces were transacted yesterday. Fine cloth and twill of renamed Japanese goods are also mixed with domestic goods and shipped there. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan have been actively placing bids, transacting more than 300 pieces of flower crepe de chine, flower cloth, satin, foreign yarn, stripe bleached cloth, Shanglin cloth, and bleached twill. Merchants from Yunnan have also purchased 300 pieces of February futures.

Dong Cloth: In the morning market, the selling price of white goods was weak due to the strong selling wind in the market. Bids on this street were sluggish, and fine cloth and fine twill continued to soften. Longtou fine cloth was once bid at 11 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. Later, it was heard that merchants from Yantai and Qingdao were taking action, purchasing 300-400 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. There were also a few transactions on this street, and the situation turned firm, but the market price still fell by about 2 and a half fen per piece compared to the previous day. The output of factories in the occupied areas that are forcibly occupied and controlled by the Japanese has been sold on the market yesterday, including Shenying coarse cloth and fine cloth from Suzhou Su Lun Factory, which are distributed by Nei Wai Mian Co. The opening price of 16-pound Blue Shenying coarse cloth is 13 yuan and 2 jiao per piece, and the opening price of 12-pound Shenying fine cloth is 10 yuan and 9 jiao. The wholesale dealers on this street bought 50 bales. Merchants from Kaifeng handled more than 40 boxes of new flower serge and broadcloth, satin from Nei Wai, Meihua, Guangtai and other factories, all of which were shipped in postal packages. Flower serge is 4 jiao and 1 and a half fen per yard, flower broadcloth is 4 jiao and 2 and a half fen, and satin of each grade is between 10 yuan and 034 jiao per piece.

Export: 40 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen, 350 pieces to Swatow, 20 pieces to Hong Kong, 55 pieces to Haikou, 80 pieces to Beihai, 520 pieces to Haiphong, and 50 pieces to Yantai today.

### Oil Cakes: Soybean Oil Rises Sharply and Then Falls Slightly, Raw Oil is Quietly Popular

Yesterday, the spot and near-term prices of soybean oil were firm, but the far-term prices fell slightly. The overall trend is under a high wave and cannot escape the situation of a small pullback. A total of 500 pieces of Yantai Qishan oil were opened, priced at 21 yuan. More than 100 pieces of Dalian Qi soybean oil were priced at 26 yuan and 2 jiao. More than 70 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were priced at 28 yuan, 2 jiao and a half to 3 jiao. 50 barrels for delivery in three or four days were priced at 28 yuan and 1 jiao and a half. 100 barrels for delivery at the end of January were priced at 28 yuan and 05 fen and 27 yuan and 9 jiao. 100 barrels to be loaded in the second half of January were priced at 27 yuan and a quarter jiao and a half. 50 barrels to be loaded in the second half of February were priced at 28 yuan and 1 jiao and a half. Although peanut oil did not trade yesterday, it is said that under the insufficient supply, the market situation is quite popular. Among the export goods, 410 tins of raw oil are being shipped to Xiamen today, and 240 pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Grains: Insufficient Flour Production

Still Difficult to Fully Supply Demand, More Than 20,000 Bags Exported Today

Yesterday, the spot flour market continued to be active, but it was difficult for transactions to become active again. Because the current production of each factory is insufficient, it is still difficult to fully supply large merchants, and the number of customer sales is also scattered. Yesterday, in the Tianjin market, the demand for flour from the artillery, navy ships, etc. gradually improved. Merchants from Nanyang, Swatow and other places are also purchasing goods for the New Year one after another. The total market transaction volume continued to be more than 60,000 bags, including retail sales on this street. The original price of each brand of No. 2 flour was 4 yuan and 8 jiao, while Hong Caishen and Hong Xinghua flour did not trade.

The export of flour today includes 10,000 bags to Tianjin, 2,000 bags to Xiamen, and 9,500 bags to Swatow.

### Wheat Merchants are Unwilling to Sell Cheaply, Large Quantities of Miscellaneous Grains are Shipped to the South

Yesterday, the demand for wheat from the factories decreased sharply, the production price did not loosen, and the arrivals gradually decreased. In addition, the second batch of Fufeng Ding wheat still has to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month. Therefore, most of the wheat in stock on the market is unwilling to depreciate and sell off again. The factory is also difficult to suppress the price, so the downward trend in the market has gradually subsided. High-grade goods are all fixed, while the price of mid-grade goods and tide wheat is still uneven. The bulk of the transactions in the whole market was Wuhu wheat, followed by Jiangbei Nanjing wheat, totaling more than 5,000 bags, which was purchased by Fuxin Factory for 3,000 bags and Fufeng Factory for 2,000 bags. The highest price was still 6 yuan and 5 jiao.

Among the miscellaneous imports, 200 bags of soybeans were transported from Haimen yesterday. In terms of exports, 525 tons of beans were transported to Bombay, and 248 tons were transported to Columbus yesterday. Today, there are also 1,000 bags of wheat bran shipped to Swatow, 550 bags of beans shipped to Xiamen, 2,200 bags of beans shipped to Swatow, 1,760 bags of beans shipped to Swatow, 690 pieces of bean cakes shipped to Swatow, 400 bags of raw peanuts shipped to Swatow, and 4,770 bags of peanuts shipped to Hong Kong.

### Glutinous Rice is Uniquely Popular, Japonica Rice is Sluggish, Cannot Escape the Law of Supply and Demand

Yesterday, each grade of japonica rice showed a small decline. Only glutinous rice was popular, because there were only 300 bags in the whole city, and the sales of tea shops and distilleries were very good. The sellers immediately hoarded the goods and raised the price to 15 yuan. After repeated bargaining, the transaction was finally opened at 14 yuan and 8 jiao for special grade goods. The market had already risen by 2 jiao, which was truly unpredictable. As for the other grades of japonica rice, although there were only five ships from the lower reaches of the river, as many as 10,000 bags arrived by steamer, and about 5,000 bags arrived by train. It is said that it was due to the financial situation near the end of the year, which made people even more nervous. Most of the merchants were on the sidelines, and the upper half of the market was completely silent and without any transactions. Later, after the sellers changed their course and sold off, they were still unable to get the acceptance of the buyers. Therefore, as a result, the amount purchased by the merchants and hoarders on this street was no more than about 4,000 bags. This kind of quiet scene has not been seen in recent months, and the price of thick and thin japonica rice has fallen by more than 1 jiao. Du Yangjian and Bu Jian also had difficulty standing firm at this time, and they all declined by a similar amount.

### Wuhu Indica Rice Production Price is Reported to be Rising

Customers are Competing to Handle Direct Transshipment, and the Selling Price of Foreign Rice is Also Seeing an Increase

The morning market of Ke indica rice continued to be weak, and each Jingwu indica rice once continued to decline by 4-5 fen. Then, news came from Wuhu that the shippers were directly transshipping and competing to handle it, and the market price rose by 3-4 jiao. The owners immediately hoarded the goods and refused to continue selling them. The market also gradually rebounded, and the special high-grade goods were again quoted at 11 yuan, and the market price of Wuhu indica rice had also crossed 10 yuan. However, the current stock in Shanghai is full, and the source of supply by rail is endless. How will the later market be, it is still difficult to predict. Yesterday, the purchase by each merchant on this street was more active, and the transaction volume for the whole day was more than 2,000 bags.

The scattered sales of foreign rice have gradually become active recently, and the stock on the market is scarce. Hoarders are holding firm, and floating goods have been sold out. Therefore, the market price of vendors and distributors is taking the opportunity to increase. No. 1 Saigon, including freight, has been quoted at 14 yuan and 5-6 jiao, and the net price without freight is also asking for 14 yuan and 3-4 jiao, which is an increase of 2-3 jiao compared to the selling price at the beginning of the month.

### Sugar Market: Chaozhou Sugar is Upside Down

The sugar market was still stable yesterday. 200 bags of #24 raw sugar and transshipment goods were traded at a price of 16 yuan and 8 jiao, and spot goods were quoted at 25 yuan and 1 jiao, but no transactions were made. Taikoo sugar did not fluctuate much. Merchants from Chaozhou quoted dozens of bags of special white domestic sugar at a price of 19 yuan and 5 jiao, and more than 100 bags of red sand sugar at 15 yuan and 4 jiao and a half. According to news, the newly extracted Zhuang Qing Hua Shen of Chaozhou sugar requires 15 yuan, but it is difficult to approach this price here for the time being, forming an upside-down phenomenon. 230 bags of sugar came from Quanzhou yesterday, and 90 bags came from Dianhua.

### North-South Goods: Xingquan Round Dates Arrive in Shanghai

230 boxes of round dates were shipped from Quanzhou yesterday, 480 boxes from Xinghua, 390 boxes from Xiumu, and 10 boxes of longan pulp from Father Quanzhou. Boxes of honey dates were shipped from Xinghua.

### Coal: High and Low-Grade Bituminous Coal are Mixed and Sold

Although the demand for each grade of bituminous coal has recently increased sharply, high-grade goods are often too expensive, and it is not easy to raise the selling price, making sales difficult. However, the use of only low-grade goods has low flames and is easy to solidify in the furnace, so it is not welcomed by customers. Therefore, it is necessary to mix high and low-grade goods to reduce costs. Yesterday, a certain firm opened more than 200 tons of Karazi coal, most of which was this type of goods. The price of lump coal was 34 yuan and 5 jiao, and the price of mixed coal was 33 yuan, which was quite prosperous.

### Letter: Inquiry about Small Flour Milling Machines

I recently received a letter from Mr. Jia Li Song of Huangqiao, stating that most of the flour is still supplied by animal-powered mills, the quality of the flour is poor, and the cost is not low. He has long intended to set up a small flour factory to increase production. He has sent letters to several foreign firms in Shanghai to inquire about small flour milling machines, but has not received any guidance. He now thinks that since you are familiar with the Shanghai market, you must also know about this situation. Therefore, I boldly send this letter to you, and respectfully ask you to inform us of which factories or foreign firms in Shanghai sell small flour milling steel mills and steel screens with 3-10 horsepower, how much flour is produced per hour, what is the selling price, and the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of domestic and European and American products. It would be even better if you could provide drawings and instructions.

Editor: The inquiry matter does not involve editorial matters. Mr. Song's original letter is very long and his intention is profound. In the era of the War of Resistance, we must all do our best to achieve results, so we publish it for him. If each factory, foreign firm, and the general public know of this kind of machine, please let us know so that we can pass it on.

Spring and Autumn

### Amity

— Yan Gong

"Amity" is a term frequently used by diplomats. When used normally, it embodies the principle of "good neighborliness" and "beneficial neighborliness," which China considers the cornerstone of a nation's foreign policy. Its purpose is to create peaceful coexistence and shared prosperity among nations. The prerequisite is that it must be built upon the foundations of "justice," "peace," and "integrity." However, current ambitious individuals are fully utilizing "amity" as a tool for "collusion," "deception," and "enticement." Though their rhetoric may be flowery and deceptive, in reality, it is nothing more than a "smokescreen" or a "sugar-coated pill."

The opposite of "amity" is "hatred." The amity touted by aggressors is inherently immoral and unreasonable. In form, it is a smile concealing a dagger. In effect, it is used to fool and scheme against others. Therefore, the result is the continuous creation of indelible "hatred" throughout the world. Even if such conspiracies and cunning schemes succeed temporarily, they only sow the seeds of future struggles and slaughters, and ultimately fail to provide a fundamental solution.

The application of amity in international relations has reached an extreme level of sophistication. To echo each other and collude in implementing "blackmail," "intimidation," and "fraud," Eastern and Western aggressors use amity as a pretext to form aggressive cliques. They call themselves "anti-communist allies," but in reality, they have no intention of opposing communism, dare not oppose communism, and are unable to oppose communism. Their sole aim is to prey on the weak.

Germany and Italy used this alluring term to entice Britain and France, achieving great success at the Munich Conference, which resulted in the sacrifice of Czechoslovakia, carving it up again and again. Hitler was victorious, and Mussolini followed by demanding French territory, presenting a continuous performance of extortion in turns.

Our Eastern neighbor, a "friendly nation," has long used this term, dreaming of progressing from "amity" to "guidance," then to "exclusive control of China" and "annexation of China," ultimately to dominate the world. It is a pity that China has long seen through its treachery. No matter how much it talks to itself, China has shattered its conspiracies with iron and blood. Unable to succeed in its designs on China, it turned its guns and, imitating Germany and Italy, shamelessly proclaimed itself a pillar of peace, singing a one-sided love song, hoping to rebuild amity with Britain to facilitate its attempt to annex China. However, Britain has learned its lesson and will not fall for Japan's tricks. More importantly, China is not Czechoslovakia. Shigemitsu Mamoru's speech felt like mere groveling.

### "Kingly Way" Propaganda in a Tramcar

— Da Kang

The No. 5 bus, carrying the lingering burnt smell of the ruined Shanshan Road, destroyed by gunfire, traveled directly from the end of North Henan Road towards San Mao Ge. The tramcar was not crowded. Perhaps because of the tragic awe that arose when passing the desolate Baoshan Road, which resembled a graveyard, the passengers' faces displayed a contemplative silence; everyone was listless.

When the tram stopped at the Tianhougong Bridge stop, a large number of passengers surged in, and the air in the tramcar was suddenly disturbed. As the tram started moving, strangely, the passengers all became lively, their eyes darting at each other. Amid the conductor's shouts, some passengers fumbled for coins, some lit cigarettes, and others seemed to be about to start conversations.

At this moment, a burly fellow, wearing a black broadcloth overcoat and a brown bowler hat, was vying with a short man next to him to buy tickets: "Let me! Let me!" "Ah! Let me! Let me!" Their politeness was overly familiar, attracting the special attention of the tramcar passengers. After this display of excessive courtesy, they each took their seats. Then, the burly fellow began to speak in a loud voice:

"Hey, hey! Do you know? Recently, a notice was posted in Hongkou saying that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has accepted Wang Jingwei's peace negotiation terms and is preparing to make peace with Japan!"

"Really?" The short man was somewhat surprised, but immediately relaxed, sighed, and then slowly said, "It's really not reasonable for China to keep fighting Japan like this! Alas! Wouldn't it be better to make peace with Japan, and everyone could do business harmoniously?"

The burly fellow had already lit a cigarette, exhaled a puff of thick smoke, and then said with emphasis, "Isn't that right?" Then, raising his voice a little, he said, "Fighting like this only makes the common people suffer! Look, the common people in the interior are suffering from the guerrillas; it's really hard to describe!"

The short man frowned, slapped his thigh hard with his right hand, seemingly a little indignant, and raised his voice as well: "Speaking of guerrillas, damn it, they are extremely hateful!..."

Then, the short man began to talk about the "hatefulness" of the guerrillas.

At this time, the passengers in the tramcar were looking at the two fellows discussing "national affairs" with resentful eyes. But the burly fellow spoke up again: "Resistance, resistance, only leads to scorched earth!"

As he spoke, both fellows sighed deeply, but among the passengers, some angrily cursed out loud. "Traitors! Traitors!"

"Bullshit!" At the same time, curses echoed in the tramcar.

But Simalu arrived. The burly fellow and the short man stood up together and got off the tram. As the tram started moving again, resentful curses filled the tramcar: "Shameless beasts!" "Next time I encounter such people, I will definitely beat them to death!"...

All the way to San Mao Ge Bridge, although the passengers got off the tram, their faces were still filled with an intensely resentful red.

### Talking about the Fake "Stamp Tax"

— Fang Zheng

Please Carefully Distinguish When Purchasing Stamp Tax to Avoid Being Fooled

Since the fall of Greater Shanghai, the stamp tax has suffered unprecedented misfortune. Post offices were forced to stop selling it, and patriotic merchants could only suffer under the condition of "post offices no longer selling, no way to purchase and affix stamps!" But soon, the stamp tax of the National Government was transported from Hong Kong to Shanghai and entrusted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to distribute to various trade associations for sale. At the same time, the pseudo "Unified Tax Bureau" also issued pseudo "stamp tax," but formal merchants mostly did not buy it, so it fell into a state of suspension. Now let's talk about this pseudo "stamp tax," because its style is similar to the real one, and it is feared that it will be confused with the real thing, deceiving general merchants who are not very literate: at the same time, it can also make everyone able to understand it clearly!

This kind of pseudo "stamp tax" is divided into eight kinds: a total of six small sizes and two large sizes. It also has distinctions between one-cent, two-cent, and yellow and blue colors. If we divide it into value and color, it has the following:

One cent (yellow) Two cents (blue) One dime ( color) Two dimes (light blue) Five dimes (purple) One yuan (red) The above small size has a total of six kinds

One dime (rose) One yuan (dark yellow) The above large size has a total of two kinds

The value and color are roughly as described above. As for the surface, the four weeks are also surrounded by patterns like real stamps, but the middle is different from the real ones. It is printed with a pagoda, next to which is one of the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon in West Lake in Hangzhou, embraced by forests in the back, and mountains hidden behind the forests; the words on the stamp, the small size is printed with "Suzhou, Zhejiang, Anhui Stamp Tax Ticket," and the English value is printed similarly to the real ones, for example, one cent is printed with Cent, and one yuan is printed with r.Dollar. In addition to having the same words as the small size, the large size also adds the four characters "Republic of China" on the top. This may be used to deceive the eyes of the Chinese people?

Therefore, due to the puppets' deliberate efforts, general merchants, especially merchants on isolated islands, must thoroughly distinguish stamp purchases!

### A Group Who Live by Submitting Articles

— Fang Zhou

After reading "A Group Who Live by Submitting Articles," I was very moved, because every day, a small amount of "crystallization of blood" is thrown into the character basket by me, but this different treatment - in fact, there are also many unavoidable difficulties - this is what every contributor should forgive. At the same time, every supplement needs readers, writers, and editors to work together. I sincerely hope that readers will often give us advice, and writers will give us valuable materials, I am very fortunate. - Editor

Each time, during the few days when the newspaper office issues payment for articles, the payment window of the accounting office is always crowded with many people. Of course, young people account for the majority of these people. They line up in order, one by one taking out the payment for their articles, some for a few cents, some for a few yuan, and even some for dozens of yuan; after checking the amount, they leave the payment window with a smile. In this way, starting from the hour when the payment for articles begins, all the way until the hour when the payment for articles stops, in those two hours, the few accountants are only busy receiving the payment receipts, checking the payment books, and calculating the payment amounts, busy almost without even having the time to drink tea.

Everyone takes the payment for their articles, and then breathes a sigh of relief, stepping out of the door of that newspaper office; but among these people receiving payment, there are also many different psychologies, for example, some people, having received the legal tender exchanged for their month's hard work, are preparing to repay debts, pay rent, buy firewood and rice, while others want to use the payment to buy a few paintings or add a little something else. However, I believe that among the general contributing comrades at present, the majority should belong to the former. Some of them, although they have a job, the income is not enough, so they use submitting articles as a side job to make up for it. Some are unemployed friends, and naturally the only way out is to sell their writing to make a living, racking their brains and straining their hearts all day long in order to support their families, and the situation is indeed very miserable. As for the latter, their writing and ink-slinging is originally a casual and occasional act, at most they only want to earn a little payment for articles to buy a few books to read. Therefore, the contributors belonging to the latter are mostly from the student world. And these people do not necessarily write regularly.

The exact number of people who submit articles in Shanghai is impossible to count, but I believe that the number of people who make a living by submitting articles must be not small, because in addition to the writers of magazines and other periodic publications, and the special writers of newspaper offices, there are more than a dozen kinds of daily and evening newspapers (large newspapers) in Shanghai where one can submit articles. Although the payment for articles varies in thickness and the required materials are different, the avenues for submitting articles are always many. For example, each daily newspaper has at least two supplements, and the evening newspapers also have one supplement, and the texts published inside are nothing more than general literary works, short essays, essays, prose, and miscellaneous essays, etc., and there are very few supplements discussing specialized academics. In addition, in addition to the telegraphic edition and the manuscripts supplied by general news agencies, newspapers also welcome external manuscripts for local news, local news, the economics edition, education and sports, and valuable features, so contributors only need to choose the subject they are closest to and most familiar with, write and submit it to the newspaper office they want to submit to. Then, if they are lucky, they may even have the possibility of being extended as a special writer.

However, although there are so many avenues for submitting articles in Shanghai, there are still many disappointed contributors, because on each editor's desk (especially the supplement editor), there are always at least thirty or more letters of manuscripts piled up every day, and the fate of these letters is that the majority are sentenced to the character basket, a part is sent back to the contributor by the postman, and another part is kept by the editor in the drawer, ready to be revised and published, or to be published when there is a shortage of manuscripts, as for those that are published, there are only three or four recommendations, accounting for only one-tenth of the total.

Ah! Those sentenced to the character basket, those returned by the postman, those kept by the editor, those published in the newspaper, are all the crystallization of the contributor's heart, but they receive different treatments. As for the smiling faces we see when receiving payment for articles, we cannot imagine the sorrow of those who have no share in receiving payment!

Chapter Two: Engineer Lin Cleverly Explains Standardization, Guide Jin Eloquently Discusses Equality

As they were joking, they heard a woman's voice calling out, "Sister Danyun! Where did you come from!" When everyone looked over, they saw a beautiful young woman, about twenty years old, with a snow-white scarf tied around her chest, dressed as a waitress, walking over with chopsticks, plates, and other food. Jin Danyun hurriedly stood up and said, "Oh! Sister Jing, are you serving here?" It turned out that the woman's surname was Wang, and her given name was Jing, and she was a relative of Jin Danyun. Wang Jing walked over with a smile, nodded slightly to Lin Jiancheng, seeming to know him, but it was the first time she had met the two Miss He, and she did not recognize them. Jin Danyun hurriedly introduced them to each other, and said, "This Miss Wang Jing is also a relative of ours." Wang Jing then handed over the menu and said, "Please order! There are not many dishes to eat these days." Miss Jin accepted the menu, and she turned to make tea. At this time, the two Miss He were somewhat puzzled. Yu Danyun knew what they meant, and said: "This Sister Wang Jing, she is also a teacher at the Yu Clan School here. They do not know what to do, but they have made an exchange condition with this restaurant, and they must come to this restaurant for a few days each month as waitresses. Either elementary school teachers or high school students, a class of seven or eight people, probably this period is her turn." He Shuangyu said: "We used to be at the Charity Association. I have also been a waitress, but I have never been a waitress on a long-term rotation basis." He Yuyu said: "The trend of waitresses has been popular in Guangdong for a long time, but it has always been regarded as a lowly service, and noble people do not bother to do it." Jin Danyun said: "This is also slowly changing. For example, in a place like Shanghai, various restaurants and teahouses have been employing women for a long time. In the past, women were employed as a tool to attract bees and butterflies to eat. And it is beautifully called a female hostess, a group of bad teenagers often say: "Hey! Let's go to a female hostess!" You think: to eat a female hostess, is it a kind of phrase? But that group of female hostesses also takes the blame, but at first it was such a society, and there was no way to deal with it. Since our country's war, men have men's affairs, restaurant waiters, etc., all use women, and there are also those erotic men, for the female waiters who are prettier, the small accounts are especially increased. Later, the Women's Service Agency issued a mnemonic-style leaflet and posted it in various restaurants and teahouses where women serve, saying: "Those who pay small accounts to women are insulting women." Such a warning to them. (22)

Entertainment Circle

### A Conversation with Director Cheng Bugao

— Nie Ge, Sent from Hong Kong

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the famous director Cheng Bugao Guang Sheng left Shanghai and joined the Central Film Studio, devoting himself to the production of national defense films. National defense films were indeed an important part of cultural propaganda during the War of Resistance; but when some salvation work urgently needed cadres, Mr. Cheng transferred to this salvation work group.

The author had the opportunity to meet this film artist practicing salvation work at a banquet. We talked from far to near, and then talked about the question of some Shanghai tabloids spreading rumors and creating incidents against him. Regarding this, Mr. Cheng was very indignant. He said: On this opportunity to come to Hong Kong, he took the time to return to Shanghai to visit his family, whom he had been separated from for more than a year, because the family in Shanghai had sent many letters and telegrams, eagerly hoping that he would return once, but when he arrived in Shanghai, although it was only a few days of stay, rumors arose, and all kinds of unreasonable suspicions were made about him and Tan Ying. A person who is engaged in salvation work, when he arrives in Shanghai under another force, and his family is in Shanghai, naturally cannot publicize that he is a person engaged in salvation work, so Mr. Cheng turned a deaf ear to the various unfounded statements made by some newspapers in Shanghai.

Many old friends in Shanghai asked him to stay in Shanghai. Zhang Shankun was willing to hire him to join Xinhua with high pay, and his family even hoped that he would stay in Shanghai, but for the sake of the five-thousand-year-old motherland, he was unwilling to abandon salvation work before the war ended.

He was very angry about the decline of general film artists after the War of Resistance. He said well: "The War of Resistance is like a mirror. Those who are base and filthy, those who are pure and clean, those who are brave and advancing, those who are afraid of death and decadent, and even the national sinners who are traitors and running dogs, all reflected their forms after the outbreak of the War of Resistance!"

Indeed, as far as the film industry, a link in the cultural world, is concerned, before the outbreak of the War of Resistance, there was no shortage of people who chanted patriotic slogans, but after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, most of the most base and filthy people were these people. On the contrary, those who had never proclaimed their dedication to the country on the surface participated in actual salvation work during this War of Resistance. The War of Resistance is truly a mirror; it reflects everyone's form, and it is impossible to escape.

Mr. Cheng also said that the life of a film practitioner is inevitably a bit "romantic." In the past, he almost went to the dance hall every night to seek anesthesia, but now his life has become the most serious and disciplined. He has forgotten all the enjoyment, and in fact he is not allowed to have time for enjoyment. In Shanghai, he traveled by car or rickshaw, but now he mostly walks, which is the most serious period of his life. But he did not think it was bitter. He said: How many times has there been such a conscious war in Chinese history? This time it is to wash away all the previous shame and reclaim the blood debt of the past, and every individual should work hard for salvation during this period.

Some people have satirized him like this: Can China be saved by relying on you, Cheng Bugao, alone to participate in salvation? His answer is: It's not like that. My personal strength is small, but the strength of the group is great. If everyone has this kind of mentality, then who will do the work of saving China?

He is now the section chief of the Third Department of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, and his wartime monthly salary is only one hundred and twenty yuan. He sends seventy yuan back to his family in Shanghai every month, although his wife Tan Ying can also support herself in the Xinhua company. Now he has transferred to Chongqing via the coastal defense, and Yang Hansheng, who came with him, has already left before him.

### Gu Chuanjie's Engagement Next Month - Fiancée is a Kunqu Opera Amateur

Gu Chuanjie is the only outstanding talent among the young male Kunqu opera actors. In the past, from "Xin Yuefu" to the transformation into "Xian Ni She," he had cooperated with Zhu Chuanming for a long time, but "Xian Ni She" failed repeatedly due to its highbrow nature. Later, in a certain process,

### Gu Chuanjie's Engagement Next Month - Fiancée is a Kunqu Opera Amateur

Chuanjie and Zhu Chuanming both retired at the same time; Gu Chuanjie was determined to study and restored his original name "Zhi Cheng." He first entered Soochow University in Suzhou, and then transferred to Jinling University in Nanjing, majoring in agronomy. After graduation, he worked in the agricultural field run by Jinling University in Zhenjiang, doing a "go to the countryside" job. Only after the sound of gunfire did he put down his sickle and hoe and come to the isolated island.

Recently, Gu Chuanjie has been befriended by banker Yan Weiyu, and his life is quite stable. In addition to occasionally performing at the invitation of private groups, most of his time is spent on books. He is preparing to translate the gongche notation of Kunqu opera into staff notation, so that it will be easier for the general public to learn. This work has been half completed and will be contacted by a bookstore for publication.

Gu Chuanjie's marriage has recently been decided through the introduction of Hu Shanyuan, the editor of "Hongcha," and the engagement ceremony will be held on the third of next month. His fiancée's surname is Zhang, and she is a Kunqu opera amateur. It can be said that she and Chuanjie are comrades, and it is naturally a happy marriage.

### Major Changes in Roles on the Tianchan Stage - Tian Shaomei and Others to Appear Tomorrow Night

— Sea

There are major changes in roles on the Tianchan Stage. In addition to inviting Li Ruchun, Dong Zhiyang, and the Zhi Cheng brothers, there are also female actor Tian Shaomei and martial arts actor Zhang Yunhe joining. They are scheduled to appear on the 26th (Thursday), first performing old plays, and the repertoire has not yet been released. Tian Shaomei is coming to Shanghai for the first time, and her performance is excellent. The opening three-day program is said to be Jade Hall Spring, Cursing the Palace of Empress He, June Snow, Little San Mazi, etc. Zhang Jianfei, the director in charge of the stage, telegraphed from Room 35 of the China Hotel in Beiping yesterday, reporting that the roles invited were generally ready. The stage has already telegraphed 2,000 yuan to Beiping from the Shanghai Bank yesterday. That night, Gu sent personnel to meet Ming and Huang Guiqiu at their residence to discuss the overall situation, and immediately sent a telegram to Mr. Zhang, the original text is as follows:

"Zhang Jianfei, China Hotel, Beiping, Xian has been wired, Wenyuan Shou Shan will be handled as is, Jing will be changed to Yuan Shihai or Ye Shengmao, Xiaosheng is best Gao Weilian or Ru Fulan, if the payment is large, change to Du Fulong."

### Kuang Zhongmou - Founding the Baile World

— Fang Lin

The Baile Commercial Plaza at the intersection of Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple, is about to be completed, and it will be realized soon. At that time, the market around Jing'an Temple will become more lively, which can be imagined. Recently, a large-scale amusement park will be discovered near the Baile Commercial Plaza, named Baile World. It is said that the capital is very strong, and the founder is Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the former Penglai City Market in Xiaoximen, Nanshi. These days, he is designing and planning, proceeding separately, and only after things are mature will he expand publicity and engage in collecting various entertainment. At that time, the residents of Luoxi can find entertainment venues nearby, and do not have to go far away.

### Impressions of the Postal Savings and Remittance Group's Joint Party

— Gao Ge

The joint party of the postal savings and remittance group of the Shanghai Federation of Money Industry Associations was a drama performance on the evening of the 21st. They borrowed the hall of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to express the spirit of amateur drama enthusiasts' research. The performance began around 7:30, and a total of four dramas were performed. The first script was "Gentleman Entertaining Guests," directed by Wei Lan, which wrote about a noble and stingy family; the second play "Chuner" was directed by Xia Feng, and this play showed the bankruptcy of the countryside. The third play "White Tea" was directed by Hu Dao; it described how college students could not even afford to eat because of economic panic, and could not afford to buy tea leaves, but they were still full of the mentality of saving people and saving the world, preparing to save those - female actors who make a living by singing, and female tailors who are under heavy pressure of life. In the end, naturally, they cannot achieve their wishes: and they are still hungry and poor, disappointed and disheartened.

The last play described the tragedy of workers in Shanghai who lost their jobs due to the war, titled "Dawn," directed by Wu Ming. This unemployed worker - Fusheng, who was unemployed due to the destruction of the factory, encountered a painful fate, but fortunately his wife still had a low-paying job to maintain the family's major responsibility, but it could only be said to supplement one in ten thousand.

Looking at the above several short plays, each has its own unique features, and in particular, the last play "Dawn" and the second play "Chuner" can fully reveal the tragic state of the real countryside and society, and arouse people's sympathy. As far as the lighting props and costumes of the entire stage are concerned, it is also worth studying. Let's talk about lighting first. I say lighting is the second life of the stage, because day, night, sadness, joy, poverty, wealth, etc.: different states can be configured and expressed by lighting, so the importance of lighting is not less than the words and actions of the actors. The configuration of the lighting is very exquisite, and naturally it can increase the brilliance of the play.

### A Record of Wang Yang

— Mo Gufu

The name Wang Yang may not be unfamiliar to readers, as her name was prominently featured in the Yi Hua production, "Woman." A brief biography is listed below:

Wang Yang's original surname was Qian, her given name Ai Hua. According to the most reliable sources, she is only seventeen years old this year and is from Jiading. She has been adventurous since she was a child, coming to Shanghai alone at the age of fourteen to study. The athlete Qian Hangsu is her cousin.

In the autumn of the year before last, she joined the Yi Hua Company, working in the film receiving room, receiving food and lodging in addition to a monthly salary of eight silver dollars. At that time, Qian was lively and exquisite, like a small bird nestling close to someone, and everyone who saw her loved her. She had also appeared fleetingly in films such as "Three Stars Accompanying the Moon" and "First Love," but no one paid attention to her at the time. When the "August 13th" incident broke out, Yi Hua stopped filming, and Qian's life became unstable. Unable to return to her hometown, she was in a dilemma. At that moment, Yao, an assistant cameraman from a certain company, tempted her to go to the sea to accompany dances. Qian was ignorant of the ways of the world and changed her name to Wang Yang, happily agreeing. Thus, she started at the International, then the Metropole, Paramount, and Ciro's, becoming famous in the dance scene, truly a popular dance hostess!

Since going to sea, a year has passed in haste. Recently, Qian told people that she must change her current life, as making a living on a volcano is very painful. Last winter, Yi Hua resumed business, and Wang Yang returned to Yi Hua as an actress, returning to her screen life. The above picture was taken when she first joined Yi Hua, a face in the shape of a duck egg, still exuding her innocent and uninhibited nature.

New Cantonese Opera News

### Luo Jiaquan Stars in Sakyamuni

— Long Yun

The latest Xin Wu Tai stage has been performing Cantonese opera, gathering many talents. Luo Jiaquan, a lead actor in the troupe, had previously retired from the stage due to special circumstances for five years. He resolutely moved south and is showing off his skills again on the red carpet, which is highly praised by the people of Shanghai. Luo Jun can sing in the "Gong" character tone, with a stable beat and a round, clear, and moving voice. Among the four great clown actors in Guangdong, Luo Jun should be the leader in terms of singing skills. His movements are all in accordance with the rules, quite different from the clumsy and pretentious actions of ordinary amateurs. It is rumored that Luo Jun has a wealth of newly written scripts, and the play "Sakyamuni's Birth" is said to have been meticulously structured by Luo Jun with mysterious plots and innovative lyrics, and polished by famous writers. The opening date is scheduled for next Saturday evening, with a planned run of four consecutive days. According to Cantonese opera customs, the program is changed daily. A play that can be performed continuously is only a famous play like the one mentioned above, and a famous actor like Luo Jun would never dare to try it lightly. It is hoped that the patrons will wait and see.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and the Pear Garden in the Former Capital (85)

— Xu Muyun

Guo Zhongheng was Gong Yunfu's yin-yang follower

Besides the early death of Deng Yuanfang, among the insiders, only Wang Fengqing could inherit Da Tou's style, and among the outsiders, Guo Zhongheng. Fengqing originally sang the role of a young clown, but later changed to a civil and military young male lead. Because his voice was quite good in the past, he changed to singing the role of a bearded man. He did indeed receive three plays passed down from Da Tou: one is "Zhao Guan," the second is "Chengdu," and the third is "Taking the Master's Seal." Some say that "Zhao Guan" was revised by Da Tou, and "Cinnabar Mole" was taught by the Luo family. In any case, Fengqing had obtained the true transmission of several signature plays in the style.

The deceased Guo Zhongheng originally studied Western medicine, but later joined the Chunyang Society and studied Da Tou's tunes. His voice was also passable. He performed the play "Chengdu" in various associations and was praised by the audience. Later, seeing Ju Peng going to the sea as an amateur and being very popular, and the income being much higher, it was much better than being a doctor, so he also went to the sea. When Yan Qiu came to Shanghai for the first time, the old male lead and young male lead he brought were all amateurs. The old male lead was Zhongheng, and the young male lead was Wang Quan, nicknamed "Heart to God Knows." (Furthermore, Quan's sung words were completely incomprehensible, and his voice was extremely low, so his colleagues gave him this nickname). Zhongheng was a fat man, so he was very qualified to play the role of the king in the Wang Mao opera.
