### The Japanese Army in Southern Shanxi Is Weak; Dreams of Invading the West Become a Bubble; Japan Requests Reinforcements from Tokyo Without Result; There Is Talk That Yi County Has Been Recaptured by the Chinese Army

(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesperson announced today that the Chinese army has recaptured important cities between the Yellow River and the Fen River in southwestern Shanxi, and the battle situation is improving daily. He also stated that the Japanese army recently requested that Tokyo send four more divisions to China, but the Japanese government was unable to comply and failed to send reinforcements. Therefore, the battle situation in southern and northern China has recently become calm. (2nd, Haitong Telegraph)

(Xi'an) Military news: There is talk that Yi County has been recovered by the Chinese army.

The Japanese army attempted to reinforce from Yuxiang and Yongji to the west of the Zhongtiao Mountains, but was intercepted by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. The Chinese army is currently fiercely attacking Ruicheng, with hopes of recapturing it. (2nd, Express News Agency Telegraph)

(Chongqing) A Chinese army spokesperson recently declared to journalists that although the Japanese army intends to invade Shaanxi Province, guerrilla forces are extremely active in the area, and the Japanese army's rear transportation lines are severely disrupted. Therefore, they have been unable to cross the river to invade Shaanxi. The spokesperson stated that the Japanese army cannot cross the Yellow River until it "annihilates" the Chinese army in the mountains of southwestern Shanxi. According to the spokesperson's opinion, if the Japanese army wants to "eliminate" the Chinese army in the mountains of southwestern Shanxi, they must reinforce with more than twice their current force. If the Japanese army cannot "annihilate" the Chinese army in southwestern Shanxi this month, their plan to invade the northwest will become a bubble, as the weather in the northwest is gradually warming, the river ice is gradually melting, and their mechanized units will lose their effectiveness. (2nd, Express News Agency Telegraph)

On the 29th of last month, a unit of the Chinese army was engaged in destroying the railway near Gaozhuangzhen, north of Jixian in northern Henan, when it was discovered by the Funabiki unit of the Japanese army. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese army retreated to the northwest. On the 30th of last month, a unit of the Chinese army encountered the Yoneyama unit of the Japanese army at Gugusai, 20 kilometers southeast of Xinxiang. Both sides suffered casualties.

Editorial

### The Speeches of the German Head of State, the British Prime Minister, and the American President

"Don't say that the overall situation is not serious, the crisis still exists," this is what former American President Herbert Hoover loudly called out yesterday in his speech at the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. In the past few days, the international situation, which has been frequently endangered, seems to have improved; the world's stock markets have suddenly shown vitality, and market prices have soared, which is the most obvious reflection of people's hearts; however, has the crisis been slightly alleviated? Is it expected to be eliminated? Or is it just a prolongation of the incubation period? From our perspective, we agree with Hoover's statement; moreover, the world is changing rapidly, and although this newspaper has repeatedly discussed the world situation recently, the twists and turns of the past three days are worth continuing to discuss.

In the past three days, there have been no actions in the international arena, only speeches, but it is by no means an exaggeration to say that future important international actions will be closely related to these speeches. There are three main speeches: one was on the evening of the 30th. German Head of State Adolf Hitler's speech in the Greater German Reichstag; the second was on the afternoon of the 31st, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons; the third was on the same day, American President Franklin D. Roosevelt's secret talk with the members of the Senate Military Affairs Committee. The three differ in their form: Hitler's and Chamberlain's speeches were completely public, while what they called secret talks were based on the principle of not announcing them. Hitler's speech was an active and pre-scheduled program, summarizing Germany's domestic and foreign affairs; whether subjective or objective, the main purpose of this speech was to clarify Germany's foreign policy. Although Chamberlain's speech was delivered in the ordinary form of the cabinet reporting to the parliament, it was, in a sense, a planned response to Hitler's speech. Roosevelt's meeting with his Senate Military Committee was called a secret talk, but it spread throughout the world in less than a day, not because of any moral or institutional flaws, or even the inability to keep it secret; it was a political and diplomatic necessity to use a semi-veiled strategy. Three days ago, everyone thought that the content of Hitler's speech would be tense, but who knew that his attitude would be to keep the sword in its sheath; Chamberlain responded with goodwill, and everyone was happy; and Roosevelt's expression that if Britain and France were in trouble, he would definitely give them strong support, was no less than hearing the sound of footsteps in an empty valley.

After hearing the three men's speeches, we deeply feel that the causes of international disputes are not only without any signs of resolution, but also that the opportunity to find a solution is still far away. Not only is it far away, but there is no reason to be optimistic about whether there is a possibility or hope of resolution in the first place. Since the crisis comes from the causes of disputes, how can we hope that the crisis will be resolved before the disputes are resolved; looking to the future, it is dark and bleak, and the overall situation is indeed difficult. What is slightly comforting is that this time, although Hitler's tone did not loosen, he did not promote the crisis, and his reckless impulse to ignore everything can sometimes be restrained; this is new information that can be used for evaluation after this speech. Chamberlain's show of goodwill to Britain has nothing to do with the causes of disputes, so it is not enough to ease the crisis; however, on Chamberlain's side, perhaps this will slightly strengthen his confidence in his policy of appeasement, or perhaps he will not fail this show of goodwill and will try something? Saying that "if the international atmosphere is not good, it is useless to conduct negotiations in order to resolve disputes, satisfy wishes, and eliminate resentment," seems to be a retreat; however, hinting that "even if countries cannot disarm, at least they should have the intention to limit armaments; if such an opportunity arrives, the people of the United Kingdom will not only extend their sympathy, but will also do their best to appease the general situation in Europe, which can be asserted," is a broad stroke, and the meaning is extremely commendable. If world public opinion temporarily abandons the distinction between current gains and losses, and devotes itself to this; and if Germany and Italy can also slightly restrain their current wishes, and recognize the importance of disarmament; then, given time, the focus of disputes may shift one day, and there may be hope for the easing of emotional friction?

Of the three speeches, only Roosevelt's secret talk cannot be regarded as the formal expression of the United States; because the publication was not done through a normal announcement, but through circuitous disclosure; it is not said that the president said this, nor that the committee members said this, but that the reporter heard it like this. Therefore, its generating power will be weaker than that of public speeches. Indeed, from the revelation of the president's ideas to becoming the country's established national policy, there should be a considerable distance in between; moreover, in fact, the politics and society of the United States are colorful and all-encompassing, and there must be people who want to come out and obstruct the president, without necessarily having any sound theories, or any brilliant insights, taking the opportunity to play up the issue, eager to try. However, in terms of Roosevelt's attitude, it is worth ten or a hundred times more than the speeches of Hitler and Chamberlain. This newspaper discussed it five days ago, believing that in order to eliminate the world crisis, the "only hope is that the major powers will step forward boldly and resolutely express that the democratic countries will share weal and woe," who knew that two days later it would be obtained from the expression of the American president; this is enough to make warmongers have scruples and restrain themselves a little. The United States has many wise men, who will surely create a strong public opinion, urging Congress to unanimously support the president's attitude and form the country's unwavering national policy? This will be the dawn of human civilization and the gospel of world peace.

### The Japanese Are Using False Pretenses to Call for Peace; Mass Organizations in North China Send Telegrams to the Entire Country, Denouncing Their Falsehoods; Using Peace as Bait to Secretly Deploy Military Forces; Intending to Divide the Forces of Resistance and Allow Them to Be Slaughtered; It Is Essential to Discern Their Treacherous Plans and Persist in Resistance to the End

(Chongqing) The Japanese army, having expended troops on a long expedition and achieved nothing after a long war, has recently issued telegrams in the name of Chinese mass organizations and non-governmental celebrities, calling for peace. Their intention is to divide the Chinese forces of resistance. The masses in North China have discerned their treachery and recently sent telegrams to the entire country denouncing their falsehoods. The original telegram is as follows: "To all agencies, newspapers, and compatriots nationwide, be aware that the enemy has achieved nothing after a long war, their military and financial resources are increasingly exhausted, and their diplomacy has also fallen into isolation. They are compelled to seek peace urgently. Knowing that our government is determined and their treacherous schemes will not succeed, they have been issuing telegrams calling for peace in the name of various mass organizations or non-governmental celebrities such as Wu Peifu, with more moderate wording than before. However, the enemy's military deployment is still proceeding relentlessly. It is clear that the enemy's goal is to use peace as bait, to divide our battle lines, and to allow us to be slaughtered at their mercy after we are divided and discouraged. Their treacherous scheme is extremely vicious. We must discern the enemy's plan, persist in resistance to the end, and strive for final victory. No matter how difficult, this will not change." Signed, Thirty-three organizations of the masses in North China. (2nd Telegraph)

(Chongqing) This morning, all Chinese newspapers published news of Wu Peifu's meeting with reporters in Beiping in prominent positions. They all claimed that Wu's remarks had indeed proved that: 1. Wu had no intention of becoming a Japanese puppet; 2. News regarding Wu's attitude was purely fabricated by the Japanese to confuse the Chinese and foreign masses. (2nd (Reuters Telegraph)

(Chongqing) At a press conference here today, a Chinese military spokesperson declared that the Japanese authorities must agree to restore China's political integrity before Wu Peifu would agree to come out of retirement, and that Wu's remarks had been altered by the Japanese to suit their own purposes. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)

(Beiping) A Japanese-controlled newspaper reported that Wu Peifu met with foreign reporters on January 31st, and "accepted Japan's conditions" as a prerequisite for taking office. However, according to Wu's confidants, Wu was very angry about this report, as he had not accepted Japan's conditions, and even declared that the Japanese army must withdraw from certain areas so that he could govern the area. He said he did not want to come out of retirement. According to some sources, Wu has never made a statement opposing the National Government, but he is very opposed to the Communists. The Japanese attempt to use Wu to preside over a mass movement and thus achieve a peaceful settlement does not seem likely to succeed. (2nd, Reuters Telegraph

(Chongqing) According to reports received by political figures here, Wu Peifu would only agree to take office as chairman of the "Pacification Committee" in Kaifeng if the Japanese accepted the conditions he put forward. The conditions he put forward to the Japanese were: 1. The Japanese army must withdraw from China; 2. All political power in areas occupied by the Japanese army (including "Manchukuo") must be returned to China; 3. Japan must not interfere in China's internal affairs and diplomacy. (2nd, Associated Press Telegraph)

### After Taking Office, Xue Yue Convenes a Meeting of the Entire Provincial Committee; Strictly Orders All Areas to Eliminate Bandits; The Municipal Government of Hedong Is Temporarily Abolished; An Office of the Provincial Government Is Established in Chongqing

Xue also telegraphed all subordinate departments in the province, saying, "At a time when military affairs are tense and the Lunar New Year is approaching, it is urgent to stabilize social order. You must earnestly formulate preventive measures, maintain local security, and be at ease in your duties, without harboring thoughts of waiting and seeing or attempting to shirk responsibility."

### Li Hanhun Specially Formulates the Guidelines for Governing Guangdong

Lian County: Guangdong Chairman Li Hanhun, at the beginning of the implementation of the new policy, specially formulated six guidelines and promulgated them to all levels of agencies throughout the province: 1.

Integrity is more important than life; 5. Disciplining oneself is more important than blaming others; 6. Strictness is better than tolerance. (2nd Telegraph)

### Chen Cheng Reports on One Week of War Situation

(Chongqing) Chen Cheng reports on the one-week war situation "from January 25th to 31st" as follows:

The war situation this week shows increasing advantages for us on both the northern and southern fronts. Considering the overall development of the war, it can be judged that the enemy troops are increasingly trapped in a quagmire, while our troops are moving closer to a turning point towards victory. Since last year, the enemy has been clamoring that they would gather all sorts of evil-doers to invade Shaanxi in the west and attack from the south and north, to fulfill their deluded dream of cutting off our international supply routes in the northwest and southwest. In reality, the enemy headquarters absolutely cannot fulfill the requests of the enemy chiefs stationed in both the north and south of China to mobilize four and six and a half divisions of troops, respectively. Therefore, the empty threats made for many days have only become a source of ridicule. Now, the overall war situation is described separately as follows:

In the Guangdong area, the enemy along the Guangzhou-Hankou, Guangzhou-Kowloon, and Guangzhou-Sanshui railways has not shown any unusual movements in the past week, and the situation is very calm. After Hua County was attacked by two or three thousand enemy troops last week, our main forces launched an active counterattack this week, and the enemy troops were unable to withstand it and collapsed. Hua County has been officially recovered by our troops. There are no enemy traces in the nearby military fields. Small scattered groups of the enemy have been routed towards the Taiping Chang area by our division and local police, who have launched a two-pronged attack. The enemy trapped in Guangzhou has thus returned to our encirclement and cannot move. Although there are more than two thousand enemy troops gathered on Zhou Island, most of them are Korean and Shandong puppet troops, with very few regular troops. Enemy warships are constantly patrolling the waters near Beihai, which proves the exhaustion of the enemy's strength.

In the Shanxi area, since our army successively recovered important strongholds such as Jixian, Daning, Xiangning, and Suixian in western Shanxi the week before last, the enemy's invasion of northern Shaanxi has become a pipe dream. After suffering heavy losses, they turned to invade the southwestern Shanxi triangular area, ignoring the failure of mobilizing troops for months and sacrificing manpower in the past. They launched a desperate attack on our heroic soldiers defending the Zhongtiao Mountains, hoping to lay the foundation for future westward invasion by sweeping through this triangular area. About three thousand enemy troops, starting from Jiexian with seven cannons and one bomber, invaded our Zhongtiao Mountain positions in three routes. At the same time, the enemy also sent more than two thousand troops to invade Heshun from Xiyang in eastern Shanxi, echoing each other from afar. After our officers and soldiers fought desperately in recent days, the enemy at Jiexian has collapsed and fled after suffering heavy casualties of more than a thousand. Although our army temporarily withdrew from Heshun, after heavily injuring the enemy commander Takahashi, more than a thousand enemies were annihilated at Guandi Temple, Zilu, and Shengchuan. The enemy did not dare to advance further, and our goal of depleting the enemy's forces has been achieved.

In the Hunan-Hubei area, the war situation in northern Hunan is calm. Most of the enemy troops stationed in the Yueyang area have withdrawn to northern Hubei and concentrated in Huangpi Xiaogan, seemingly preparing to take action. However, the war situation in Jingshan in central Hubei and Zhe River in northern Hubei in recent days has made any enemy dreams impossible. After Jingshan and Menxian were successively lost last week, our army launched a brave counterattack, and Jingshan was once recovered. We are still fighting fiercely with the enemy in the western suburbs of the county town, and we are still holding strong positions and actively advancing. In the battle of Guanyin Rock, an estimated eight or nine hundred enemy soldiers were killed. The enemy commander of the Zhe River front, Major General Fujita, and the squadron leader Maruta were both killed by our forces. The enemy forces in that area have suffered a total of more than three thousand casualties in the past month, crushing the enemy's planned invasion plot.

Other war situations: In the Henan area, the enemy in northern Henan launched an attack on our position from Bo'ai and Xiuwu with more than two thousand main forces this week. After our army desperately resisted, more than four hundred enemy soldiers were killed, and the remaining enemy soldiers fled in disarray. More than two thousand enemy puppet troops in Weishi County in southern Henan attempted to cross the Yellow River to invade westward and have been completely annihilated. In the Anhui area, more than three thousand enemy soldiers who previously invaded us from Wanzhi were severely attacked by our aircraft last week, leaving only eight hundred or so remnants to flee, losing more than two-thirds. In the Hebei area, our army engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in Julu, and captured many. In the Suiyuan area, there have been no changes since the enemy's attempt to invade Dongsheng failed last week. However, three to four thousand puppet troops, including the 4th and 6th divisions of the puppet autonomous army stationed in Guyang Wuchuan and the puppet army of Wang Shengchen stationed in Qingling River, have defected and returned to our side one after another, which has dealt a severe blow to the enemy forces in that area.

Overall, the war situation this week shows that although the enemy is clamoring about what they will do to us, in reality, they are showing their weakness and exhaustion. However, the enemy has not completely given up their final attempt. Observing the enemy's movements against our positions in the triangular area of southern Shanxi and the active increase of enemy puppet troops on Pizhou Island, we can see a glimpse of the enemy's future trends. Moreover, the enemy has recently been forcibly conscripting our young men into the army in various occupied areas in the north and south. Although the strong belief of our people in resisting the war has prevented the enemy's plan from succeeding, their ambition and cunning plan to remedy the shortage of troops are becoming increasingly intense. It can be asserted that the prelude to the fierce battle between us and the enemy is like a bow drawn to its limit, ready to be triggered at any moment. (1st dispatch)

### Roosevelt's Word Carries Weight: European War Can Be Temporarily Avoided; Isolationists in the US Senate Are Powerless; Hoover's Speech Constrains Presidential Policy; Britain and France Value It Greatly; Germany Is Very Angry

(London) European figures believe that President Roosevelt's view of the current state of military affairs is extremely important in this tense political situation. British and French figures believe that President Roosevelt's willingness to help European democratic countries reorganize their military is a great contribution to restoring the balance of power. This contribution is enough to stop the progress of dictators and may save the world from war. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)

(London) All newspapers here today printed President Roosevelt's remarks to the Senate Military Committee on Tuesday on the front page, and some newspapers criticized it in editorials. The News Chronicle stated that what the US President said was the truth, and that the gains and losses of the concepts that the United States maintains in the world must not be in the Mississippi River in the United States, but in the Rhine River in Europe. The Daily Herald stated that President Roosevelt's attitude has prevented war from happening. However, the Daily Express is not so optimistic. The newspaper warned readers not to read too much into the words, saying that President Roosevelt sympathizes with democratic countries, but his attitude is nothing more than an attitude of doing things with common sense. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

(Paris) President Roosevelt's assurances to democratic countries have made a significant and strong impression here, but it is not believed that the President's words contain the meaning that the United States will send a large army to Europe if the totalitarian countries go to war with the democratic countries of Britain and France one day. However, it is believed that the power of his words cannot be matched by the ordinary evidence of the spiritual unity of European and American democratic countries. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

(Berlin) This morning, German newspapers launched a massive attack on President Roosevelt, accusing him of being a war instigator and a supporter of communism. The People's Observer accused President Roosevelt of wanting to put the world in a catastrophe for the benefit of the Jews. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

(Berlin) Newspapers expressed outrage at the news that US President Roosevelt was discussing with the Senate Military Committee the supply of arms to various democratic countries. The headlines used included "The American Border Is on the Rhine" and "Roosevelt's Incredible Provocation." Official circles regarded this news as unofficial and unconfirmed, so they ignored it. German political figures said that if the news of the secret meeting reported in the American newspapers is true, then President Roosevelt's remarks are extremely strange, because they are nothing less than wanting to disturb Hitler's peaceful policies and prevent Europe from achieving true peace and prosperity. At this point, we cannot help but think that the United States must have encountered difficulties, so it is advocating such martial preparations in order to whitewash such unsatisfactory events. One newspaper reported, "This American action is unprecedented since the Great War. President Roosevelt has undoubtedly become Wilson II, and the United States has finally abandoned its neutral policy." (2nd Reuters dispatch)

(Rome) Italian newspapers have commented very little on US President Roosevelt's statement that the country's border is in France, only saying that Roosevelt's "new policy" is not approved by the American people and has aroused "resentment" in Berlin. (2nd Havas dispatch)

(Washington) A group is now apparently organized in the Senate to oppose President Roosevelt's aid to democratic countries other than participating in the war. This group may develop and have the same power as before to prevent the United States from joining the League of Nations and the World Court. However, President Roosevelt's position under the Constitution is extremely solid, because it does not involve the issue of concluding treaties. Therefore, the Senate's power to interfere with the President's foreign policy is still limited. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

(New York) The New York World-Telegram commented on the new change in American foreign policy indicated by President Roosevelt's consultation with the Senate Military Committee on Tuesday, saying that the foremost barrier to American peace and security is not in the Atlantic Ocean, but in Britain and France, which is now obvious. What Britain and France will encounter is a special interest in exchanging cash for the most important and most threatened vanguard corner of strengthening our national defense. Our luck in making this transaction is incredible. In terms of national defense, the value of an aircraft delivered to Britain and France is ten times more than many aircraft delivered to the US Air Force in the next six months. At the same time, isolationist Senators Clark and Nye demanded that the records of the Senate Military Committee's investigation into France's purchase of aircraft be published. Nye said that he intended to boycott future meetings of the Military Committee, which completely exceeded the steps that should be taken in democratic practice. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

(Washington) Although people here feel differently about President Roosevelt's consultation with the Senate Military Committee and its secret situation, they all expect that the President's remarks will be a sign that the ban on the shipment of arms, bullets, and aircraft to belligerent countries will be lifted when the neutrality law is amended in May. According to one commentator, in the event of a war, the United States will become the largest source of arms supply in world history. The United States' great productivity can manufacture aircraft, cannons, tanks, food, and clothing at an unparalleled speed. Yesterday, congressional isolationists protested because the President kept the proceedings of the meeting secret, but the reactions from other parties were more favorable. Senate President Pro Tempore Pittman declared, "Refusing to supply the democratic countries with preparations for defending themselves is tantamount to helping the powers engaged in threats." The remarks made by Republican Senator Johnson can represent the opinions of isolationists. He said, "The American people should have the right to know whether the meaning of the United States selling aircraft to Britain and France is that the United States has embarked on the path of war. Matters that are not only related to the Senate but also to all the people of our country are secretly told to the Senate Committee, which is to allow the facts to be distorted and misunderstood. Regarding the possibility of amending the neutrality law, Johnson believed that Britain and France would be the first to benefit from it, because the US insistence on cash and self-transportation as the basis for purchasing its goods is naturally beneficial to countries with the largest navy and merchant fleet and the largest gold reserves. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

(Washington) The matter of the United States selling aircraft to certain countries was recently brought up for discussion in the Senate. Chairman Pittman of the Foreign Relations Committee expressed his support for President Roosevelt's policies, saying, "Certain countries are posing threats to democratic countries. If we do not allow democratic countries to have the power to defend themselves, it is tantamount to helping the tyrant." Democratic Senator Clark of Missouri and Democratic Senator Johnson of Colorado said that the results of the Senate Military Committee's investigation into the issue of selling aircraft to certain countries, as well as the accidental death of French aviation representative Schmidlin during a bomber test flight, should be submitted to the Senate. Johnson also said that the policy of supporting democratic countries is enough to invite crisis, so the process of this case should be thoroughly understood by the American people. Republican Senator Nye said that it is inappropriate for the Army Committee to hold secret meetings and not allow the American people to know the truth about the country's policies. He has decided to refuse to attend the committee to protest. Democratic Senator Minton of Indiana and Democratic Senator Clark of Missouri have also decided to give speeches, and therefore, this matter may transform into a debate on foreign policy, which is not necessarily impossible. In addition, the leader of the Democratic Party caucus, Senator Barkley of Kentucky, supported the government's views and argued that the explanations heard by the Army Committee should be kept secret to prevent American secrets from leaking to foreign countries. Several other senators said that the proceedings of the Army Committee meeting yesterday were leaked to the press, which was inappropriate. The Army Committee is scheduled to hold a secret meeting again on the 5th of this month. (1st Havas dispatch)

(New York) Regarding President Roosevelt's meeting with the members of the Senate Military Committee, all newspapers praised it. Among them, the New York newspapers and major newspapers from other cities welcomed the President's promise to supply arms to various democratic countries. However, some newspapers believed that the President should not keep such matters secret from the Senate, but should speak to the Army Committee. The New York Evening Post stated that the President needs to make the people aware of the truth about the international situation, and the President should pay attention to this matter. "The United States is now better prepared to deal with the crisis than it was between 1914 and 1917. We agree with the President's expression of sympathy to various democratic countries. The President views the threats posed to the world by various dictatorships as increasing, and the democratic countries must therefore act in unison. We also have the same feeling." The New York Times stated that we should be wary of German leader Hitler. "Looking at the various events of the past year, the surface posture of the National Socialist foreign policy is often contrary to its inner workings." His annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia can be taken as a lesson. As for the American view of Germany, when President Roosevelt spoke to the Senate Army Committee yesterday, he may not have clearly stated that the American border is in France, but the President deeply believes that France is a friendly country that we should care about and must cooperate to maintain, just as it is a barrier for our country. Anyone who has listened to the President's speech will be able to fully feel this." (2nd Havas dispatch)

(Washington) The Senate today still demanded that President Roosevelt explain to the people his policy of helping Britain and France reorganize their military. Republican Senator Johnson said, "The current problem is that we are about to take actions that will involve us in the war without letting the people know." Democratic Senator Clark also said, "The boundary line of the United States has now been extended to the Rhine region," and said that unless the government quickly clarifies its policy, he will request the Senate to review it. Furthermore, this action to help France expand its air force will hinder the completion of the American air force plan, and he demanded that the Senate Military Committee publish its records and the proceedings of its secret meeting with President Roosevelt. It is said that the predictions of the American ambassadors to Britain and France in the Senate Committee that war would break out in Europe this spring and the comments about the inadequacy of British and French military preparations were completely inciting the hearing of the committee. However, in the midst of various opinions, the leader of the Senate Democrats, Barkley, stood up and declared that if the United States sold aircraft to a peaceful country, how could it involve the United States in a whirlpool? At that time, Johnson said, "The problem is in the secrecy, and everything must be careful at the beginning, and it will surely lead to great disaster in the future. Therefore, we must know the truth about our actions in advance." (1st Associated Press dispatch)

(Washington) Congressional figures declared today that although some people in the Senate have protested and plan to investigate the secret sale of arms by the United States to Britain and France, the number is still not very large. Some people have criticized President Roosevelt for instructing the Senate Military Committee to keep it a secret, but most of them are Republicans and Democrats who have disagreements with the government. Democratic Senator Clark of the Senate demanded that the details of the United States selling aircraft to France be published. The Senate Military Committee will consider this suggestion tomorrow. It is said that in the 18-member committee, there are five Republicans and at least two Democrats who will support Clark's proposal. (1st Associated Press dispatch)

(Chicago) Former US President Hoover gave a speech at the Foreign Relations Association today and heavily criticized President Roosevelt's "new foreign policy." Hoover said, "Direct or indirect oppression of foreign countries will cause war. Strong countries encountering such pressure will rise up and make bloody resistance. Anyone who thinks about economic sanctions must think about war. It is delirium to say that Japan, Germany, Italy, or the Soviet Union, or these countries united, will make a military attack on the Western Hemisphere." Hoover said that Roosevelt's policy means that the United States must decide who is the aggressor. Roosevelt's policy is very likely to provoke retaliatory action and must have sufficient preparations to back it up. He said that the invasion of communism, national socialism, and fascism is an international problem that cannot be repelled by warships or aircraft. Hoover continued that another great war may make dictatorship popular all over the world, and the United States may adopt such a system. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)

(Chicago) Former President Hoover (Republican) gave a speech at the Foreign Affairs Association last night, opposing isolationism. He said, "The United States is now facing two threats, one is the military aggression of various totalitarian countries, and the other is the invasion of totalitarian ideas, which is intended to destroy democracy. The first threat can be viewed in two ways, one is the direct threat to the Western Hemisphere, and the other is the indirect threat due to our concern for various democratic allies in Europe and Asia. Although military aggression is not easy to carry out, if various totalitarian countries attack our country regardless of right and wrong, they will definitely encounter extremely strong defense and retreat. As for ideological invasion, this is a domestic political problem. We must know that various ideas cannot be destroyed by warships or aircraft. "We also have no intention of attacking various dictatorial countries or hoping to fundamentally eradicate the ideas of various countries, because fighting for ideas will also have destructive consequences, and the severity of the disaster may surpass the religious wars of the Middle Ages. We only want to prevent non-American ideas from invading America. The only way to do this is to ban communism, national socialism, fascism, and the members of these parties from America, so that our country's various facilities will not be eroded by them. Hoover then discussed the European situation, saying, "We must not think that it is not serious. We must know that the crisis does exist, but its urgency is not as great as that revealed in various speeches. Since the crisis is imminent, there are often ways to eliminate it." His conclusion is that the American people should now unhesitatingly express their indignation at various injustices and exclusions, and provide assistance to suffering humanity. "We should not stick to isolationism, but should maintain peace in a peaceful way and cooperate with other countries economically to restore prosperity. However, it is not possible to correct unfair things or establish lasting peace with military threats, economic pressure, or war. This is what we have truly known and seen based on reason, history, and past experience." (1st Havas dispatch)

(Washington) Regarding President Roosevelt's conversation with members of the Senate Army Committee on the matter of the United States selling aircraft to certain countries, a senator recently confirmed the situation to a visitor from the Havas News Agency. President Roosevelt told the members that the world situation was like a "volcano about to erupt." Once it erupts, no matter what policies the United States pursues, it will inevitably be affected. It is appropriate to cooperate with various democratic countries, which has only advantages and no disadvantages. Britain and France bear the heaviest burden in the conflict between democratic and totalitarian ideologies. The United States can still stay out of it, but if Britain and France are defeated, the republics of North and South America will become the last barrier of democracy, and the disaster will be imminent. Even at this moment, if various totalitarian countries are allowed to expand their territories, the republics of America will definitely be affected. In addition, a member of the Senate Army Committee also told the Havas News Agency that President Roosevelt had said yesterday that in addition to Britain and France, the United States is also willing to sell arms to "other independent countries in Europe" that are fighting against the aggression of various dictatorships.

### German Trade: Significant Import Surplus Last Year; Exports to China Down 30%; Exports to Japan Also Down Over 20%

(Berlin) German trade showed an import surplus of 192,000,000 marks last year, compared to an export surplus of 413,000,000 marks the previous year. Imports for the year totaled 5,449,000,000 marks, and exports totaled 5,237,000,000 marks. The export amount was 531,000,000 marks lower than the previous year. Exports to the UK decreased by 81,000,000 marks, and exports to the Soviet Union decreased by 85,000,000 marks, equivalent to a drop of 75%. Exports to China decreased by approximately 49,000,000 marks, a decrease of 33%. Exports to Japan decreased by 24,000,000 marks, a decrease of 21%. Exports to India decreased by slightly more than 37,000,000 marks. (2nd Reuters)

(Berlin) When Chancellor Hitler delivered a speech on the 30th of last month, he mentioned that Germany must develop its export industry. It was widely rumored that Dr. Schacht, the former governor of the central bank, had been ordered to take charge of this. However, well-informed sources here have denied this, stating that Dr. Schacht has not been assigned any special mission since leaving office. (2nd Havas)

### Bank of England Gold Reserves to Be Revalued; Revaluation to Be Done Weekly; Banknotes Reduced to Â£30 Million

(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon proposed a bill to the House of Commons, requesting permission for the government to revalue the Bank of England's cash reserves and temporarily reduce the amount of banknotes in circulation from Â£400,000,000 to Â£300,000,000. For over two hundred years, the value of gold held by the Bank of England has been fixed at 85 shillings per ounce (the current market price is over 140 shillings). It is now proposed to revalue it weekly according to the market price. After the valuation, a comparison will be made between the statutory reserve ratio and the amount of banknotes in circulation. If there is a surplus in the reserve ratio, it will be used to replenish the Exchange Equalisation Account. (2nd Havas)

(London) On January 6, the Treasury increased the amount of banknotes in circulation to Â£400 million, based on the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928, and planned to transfer the Bank of England's gold reserves to the Exchange Equalisation Account. At that time, the government stated that it would propose a bill to amend this when Parliament convened. Chancellor Simon has now submitted this amendment to the House of Commons. According to the bill, all gold and other assets of the Bank of England's Issue Department will be revalued at market prices. If the total value exceeds the total amount of banknotes in circulation, the excess will be transferred to the Exchange Equalisation Account. If there is a shortfall, it will be made up from the Exchange Equalisation Account. The gold held by the Bank of England is currently valued at the old price of 85 shillings per ounce. According to the amendment, the value of the gold reserves will increase along with the current market price. Since the gold remains in the Issue Department, the amount of banknotes in circulation can be set at Â£300 million, rather than the current temporary amount of Â£400 million. It is said that the purpose of transferring the gold reserves is to strengthen the Exchange Equalisation Account, so that it has sufficient financial resources to cope with any situation. Today, various circles in London are discussing the significance of revaluing the Bank of England's gold reserves. The stock market's buying momentum is gradually increasing, believing that when Chancellor Simon is considering how to deal with large military expenditures, the Â£94 million gained from revaluing gold reserves is a very welcome source of income. Even if the ratio between this year's tax revenue and military borrowing can be maintained, taxpayers will still have to bear an additional burden of Â£100 million to Â£150 million, or pay an additional two or three shillings of income tax per pound. In practice, this kind of burden is obviously difficult to implement. Chancellor Simon will probably use the surplus gained from revaluing gold reserves instead of increasing the burden on taxpayers. As a result, stock market prices have risen and there are many buyers of gold mining stocks, because the revaluation of gold is clear proof that the government is confident that it can maintain the current value of gold in the long term. At the same time, the British monetary system will also become more stable as a result, and government bonds will benefit accordingly. (1st Reuters)

(London) The Times commented on the bill proposed by Chancellor Simon to the House of Commons regarding the revaluation of the Bank of England's cash reserves, stating that Britain's "managed" financial system is becoming more and more apparent. What this bill stipulates is that the original statutory value of cash reserves will be raised to be commensurate with the market price. In addition, there is another key point, namely that the valuation of cash reserves at market prices is not immutable. In the future, it must be adjusted weekly according to market fluctuations. The scope of application of this method is not limited to the cash reserves of the bank's Issue Department, but also to all securities reserves of the department, which must be handled uniformly every week. This new system is called the "market price gold standard." In other words, according to past practice, the bank's banknote issuance volume was transferred based on the amount of cash reserves. In the future, the opposite is true, that is, the total issuance volume has a fixed number, and the issuance reserves are transferred based on the market price and the banknote issuance volume. (2nd Havas)

(Paris) Political figures here unanimously praised the British authorities' decision to revalue the Bank of England's cash reserves, and said that the French authorities had also taken the same measures, which shows that the UK and France are adopting the same policies on finance. (2nd Havas)

### British Cabinet Discusses Policy of Appeasing the European Situation; Colonies and Disarmament Should Be Discussed Together; Germany Still Unwilling to Mix Them

(London) The cabinet held a meeting this morning at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street, and then continued the meeting this afternoon in the Prime Minister's office in the Houses of Parliament. It was also decided to convene another meeting tomorrow morning. Prime Minister Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace at 6 p.m. to meet with King George VI and present his report. Conservative Party sources claimed that the reason the cabinet has been meeting repeatedly is that German Chancellor Hitler's recent speech was not aggressive, and Prime Minister Chamberlain is preparing to negotiate with Germany on the issue of returning Germany's old colonies, but on the condition that Germany agrees to sign a public arms limitation agreement. The first cabinet meeting this morning focused on Hitler's speech and the Spanish issue. Regarding the speech, the Foreign Office had made startling predictions beforehand, which later proved to be inaccurate. Certain cabinet members immediately expressed their dissatisfaction. In general, the cabinet has decided to continue to pursue a policy of compromise and appeasement, while continuing to accelerate the expansion of armaments. Regarding the Spanish issue, according to reports from Burgos, Spain, the Nationalists' victory is becoming more and more certain. After the end of the civil war, General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalists, also intends to withdraw foreign volunteers. Therefore, Britain's current policy, namely the non-intervention policy, should still be maintained. The second cabinet meeting this afternoon discussed domestic issues. According to certain Conservative Party figures, if Mussolini's speech at the Fascist Party Supreme Council on the 4th of this month proves that the international situation has eased, Prime Minister Chamberlain should consider holding a general election. The cabinet meeting tomorrow morning will focus on discussing agricultural issues. In addition, the words of U.S. President Roosevelt yesterday to the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee regarding the sale of American aircraft to various democratic countries are highly valued by the British Cabinet, and are considered to be the most important development in diplomacy since the end of the European War. It is also possible that the cabinet meeting tomorrow will discuss the report submitted by the British Embassy in the United States. (1st Havas)

(Berlin) After Chancellor Hitler's speech, the demand for Germany to restore its old colonies has taken priority, and is related to "Italy's inherent wishes." Those in charge do not shy away from this. As for the view that the colonial demands should be sought within the scope of a general solution to European problems, it is rejected. It is generally said that Germany's restoration of its old colonies should not be attached to any conditions. In addition, observers also stated that the Chancellor's speech stated, "I believe that lasting peace can be established," but this sentence was not included in the English and French translations prepared by the Propaganda Department for foreign journalists on that day, but was inserted by the Chancellor at the last minute. The significance of this is noteworthy. As for the tone of the newspapers, in addition to emphasizing that the contradiction between "rich countries" and "poor countries" is deepening, they also protested against the misrepresentation of the Chancellor's speech regarding the joint relationship between Germany and Italy by certain foreign newspapers, stating that if the legitimate demands of Germany and Italy are not met, and a war is caused as a result, the responsibility cannot be borne by Germany and Italy. In addition, the Chancellor's admission that Germany has encountered economic difficulties is very meaningful, because in the past, government authorities have always been tight-lipped about the country's economic difficulties, fearing that it would cause public anxiety. Now that the Chancellor has frankly admitted it, this is probably a sign of a change in Germany's domestic and foreign policies. In terms of foreign affairs, the German authorities want to use economic difficulties as an argument to prove that colonial demands and export promotion policies are fully justified. In terms of domestic affairs, the German authorities want to use this argument to demand that the people continue to make sacrifices, and attribute the responsibility for these sacrifices to "rich countries," and show that they are turning a blind eye to the suffering of the German people.

### Balkans: Brewing Changes; Romanian Foreign Minister to Visit Yugoslavia

Bucharest, Romania: In the past half month, there have been widespread rumors in southeastern Europe that borders may change. It is expected that the Balkan Entente countries will try to improve relations between Romania and Bulgaria at their meeting here next month, and enable Bulgaria to join the Balkan Entente. However, Bulgaria's accession to the Balkan Entente would inevitably require it to abandon its claims to Dobruja, which Bulgaria may not be willing to do. (2nd Reuters)

Budapest, Hungary: Well-informed sources here say that Romania has sent a large number of reinforcements to Dobruja in the past few days, because the Bulgarian parliament recently made statements about the minority platform, which Romania is worried and uneasy about. (2nd Reuters)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia: After Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrived here yesterday, he paid his respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Hero this morning and laid a wreath. He was hosted at a luncheon by the Romanian ChargÃ© d'Affaires in Yugoslavia. After the meal, he will hold talks with Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister StojadinoviÄ, and a communiquÃ© will be issued at 6 p.m. It is generally observed that this communiquÃ© will focus on the good relations between Romania and Yugoslavia, and explain that after Yugoslavia's mediation, relations between Romania and Hungary and Bulgaria have improved due to Yugoslavia's mediation. Prime Minister StojadinoviÄ will host a dinner for Foreign Minister Gafencu and his wife at his private residence in the evening, and the Foreign Minister will return to Bucharest tonight.

### Romanian Cabinet Reshuffle; Fascists Strictly Prohibited

Bucharest, Romania: After the Cristescu cabinet submitted its resignation, King Carol II immediately ordered Cristescu to organize a new cabinet, which has been completed and was sworn in at 7:30 p.m. The important cabinet members are as follows:

Prime Minister Cristescu, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense and Interior GÄlÄÅescu (former Minister of Interior), Minister of Armaments SlÄvescu (former Minister of Finance), Minister of Finance and Governor of the National Bank Constantinescu (new appointment), Minister of National Economy Beuiu (new appointment), Minister of Aviation and Navy General Teodorescu (reappointed), Foreign Minister Gafencu (reappointed),

After the new cabinet was formed, political figures commented: "Minister of Interior GÄlÄÅescu was the central figure in the previous cabinet. This time, in addition to being reappointed as Minister of Interior, he also serves as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense. In the future, he will be able to command the military and police with full authority, and take strict measures to suppress the activities of the fascist Iron Guard." Recently, many members of the Iron Guard have been conducting propaganda in the army, but very few officers have been incited by them. (1st Havas)

### Spanish Parliament Meets; Prime Minister Speaks; Fight to the End

Figueres: The Congress of Deputies of the Spanish Republic held a meeting at 10 p.m. last night in the basement of an old fortress in this city, and unanimously approved the anti-war policy of the Republican government. The date and location of the meeting were kept strictly secret beforehand, and were only announced yesterday evening. 62 deputies from anti-fascist parties attended, and the remaining 102 were unable to attend due to the war. (2nd Havas)

Figueres: At the meeting of the Congress of Deputies last night, Prime Minister NegrÃ­n delivered a speech explaining the reasons on which the government's policy of fighting to the end is based. He said that the government forces can continue to fight in Catalonia, and even if they are forced to withdraw from Catalonia in the future, they will continue to fight in the central and southern theaters. The Republican government is fighting for the country's independence and survival. Victory means freedom and autonomy, and defeat means that other countries will use all means under a totalitarian system to control our country. At that time, Spain will exist in name only. In addition, our country's war has global significance. The Republican government has previously announced a 13-point program, which can be summarized into the following three major principles: 1. Guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of Spain; 2. Guarantee the right of self-determination for the people of this country; 3. Once the war is over, national discipline must be maintained and the movement to exclude dissidents caused by the civil war must be stopped. (2nd Havas)

Burgos: General Jordana, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Nationalist government, told the Havas News Agency special envoy: "At this point in time, the world should recognize that there is no other government in Spain except the Nationalist government. The Nationalists' recapture of Barcelona is of great significance in international politics. In military terms, the morale of the Nationalist army is high and its strength is sufficient, which the demoralized Red Army cannot hope to match. Therefore, all countries should recognize the Nationalist government as the legitimate government of Spain. If this can be done, it will not only end the Spanish civil war, but also guarantee European peace." (2nd Havas)

Perpignan: French Interior Minister Sarraut told reporters that as of now, no fewer than 45,000 Spanish children who have come to France for refuge have been taken in by local authorities.

In addition, the government has also strictly ordered the border guards to prohibit Spanish men from fleeing to France. "Interior Minister Sarraut and Health Minister Rucard visited the border town of CerbÃ¨re together today and expressed their condolences to the refugee women and children. (1st Havas)

### Fascist Party Supreme Council to Open Tomorrow

(Rome) The Fascist Party Supreme Council is scheduled to meet on the evening of the 4th of this month, with Prime Minister Mussolini personally presiding. The meeting will decide on Italy's attitude towards the Spanish issue and the demands that should be made to France. Therefore, political and diplomatic figures here attach great importance to the meeting. In addition, domestic issues such as reform and secondary education, so that the cultural and economic life of the Italian people under the Fascist corporate parliamentary system are mutually adapted, are important and will also be submitted for discussion at the meeting.

### Japanese Parliament: Complex Discussions; Still the Same Old Tune

(Tokyo) On the 1st, the general budget committee of the House of Representatives entered a state of close combat. The main points of the debate focused on: 1. The cabinet increasing the number of cabinet members from political parties; 2. Whether the policies of former Foreign Minister Hirota, Army Minister Sugiyama, incumbent Foreign Minister Arita, and Army Minister Itagaki are different; 3. Whether to demand reparations from China; 4. Whether to respect the interests of third countries in China. First, Seto, a member of the Seiyukai, asked that Prime Minister Hiranuma had said in his speech that he respected the position of political parties, but the current cabinet only has two political party cabinet members, which is not enough to show that the current cabinet respects political parties. He should increase the number as soon as possible, so as to achieve the actual effect of national unity. Hiranuma only replied that his cabinet was formed based on talent, regardless of whether they were political party members, but he would fully respect the position of political parties. Seto also asked whether it was rumored that the policies of the former and current foreign and army ministers were quite different. Hiranuma only answered from the side that no country in the world has an unchanging policy. Representative Mui asked whether third countries would be compensated for the damages caused by Japan's military actions in China. Arita replied that Japan might automatically provide relief, but had no intention of paying compensation. Arita then increased his tone and said that a certain department of the recent cabinet advocated taking a more active attitude and declaring that a state of war already existed, so under military action, the interests of third countries in China need not be considered. Seiyukai member Eto asked, why not demand "reparations" from China? He also asked whether the four principles for resolving the war proposed by Hirota had not changed. Arita replied that Japan's fundamental policy towards China remained unchanged. Although Konoe's statement on December 22 was different from previous statements, this was the result of environmental changes, but Konoe's statement has not changed so far. Watanabe, a member of the Minseito, asked about the security situation in North China. Itagaki replied that the troops had recently been concentrated in the "occupied areas" to maintain security in the area as much as possible. (2nd Dispatch)

(Tokyo) At the meeting of the House of Peers this morning, Baron Sakamoto asked Navy Minister Yonai to recently guarantee the defense security of the Pacific to the whole country. He wondered whether this included the fuel issue. Baron Itaya also spoke about the US's fortification of the Aleutian Islands and Guam, and the importance of Japan's sufficient supply of kerosene, and advocated a three-year plan to develop oil fields, with the government subsidizing 300 million yuan in funding. Itaya went on to mention rumors that the UK and the US were planning to put economic pressure on Japan, and urged the Foreign Minister to prepare for any eventuality. He then expressed his opinion that Hitler's speech, which allowed him to say that he would be friends with Japan in wartime, suggested that it was necessary to review the position of the UK, the US and France in East Asia. Foreign Minister Arita replied that Japan's policy of establishing a new order in East Asia was based on the spirit of the "Imperial Way" and its purpose was to seek that everyone gets what they deserve. Japan does not intend to exclude the rights of third countries in the Far East, but wants to cooperate with China and "Manchukuo" to form a powerful link in the world economic chain. (2nd Reuters)

### Border Provocations by Japanese and Puppet Troops; Russia Again Warns Japan; Soviet Internal Affairs to Return to Normal; Elimination of Barriers Between Intellectuals, Farmers, and Workers

(Moscow) Recently, Japanese and puppet troops have frequently crossed the border, leading to repeated clashes. On January 31st, a relatively serious conflict occurred near the Karasduvskaya border post. Five Soviet border patrol members were patrolling the area when they were suddenly fired upon by eighteen Japanese and puppet soldiers using rifles and machine guns. The Japanese and puppet soldiers had already crossed the border and occupied a small island belonging to the Soviet Union in the Yagon River. The Soviet patrol was forced to retaliate, and with the timely arrival of reinforcements, the Japanese and puppet soldiers were driven off the island. They carried away seven wounded soldiers as they retreated. Only one Soviet squad leader sustained minor injuries. Regarding this incident, the Soviet ChargÃ© d'Affaires in Japan has been instructed to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese government, pointing out the repeated violations of the border by Japanese and puppet troops and warning the Japanese side of the possible consequences. (TASS dispatch, 1st)

(Tokyo) According to the records of the House of Representatives, Minister of War Itagaki stated yesterday afternoon in response to a question from MinseitÅ (Democratic Constitutional Party) member Tashiro regarding the Soviet attitude toward Japan: "Since the Changkufeng Incident, the Soviet Union has clearly strengthened its military preparedness in the Far East to counter Japan. The Far Eastern Red Army has been reorganized into two units, and the commander of the Far Eastern Red Army, Vasily Blyukher, has been replaced. These are well-known facts. As for Changkufeng, the Soviet authorities appear to be constructing defensive fortifications east of what they call the Soviet-Manchukuo border. Illegal border crossings by Soviet soldiers along the entire Soviet-Manchukuo border have greatly increased. Generally speaking, these actions by the Soviet Union are not intentional but due to negligence, so their nature is not serious. The recent border situation is relatively peaceful." Itagaki also assured the questioner that the Japanese army has taken sufficient precautionary measures to ensure the safety of the border area, but he declined to disclose the details. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

(Moscow) It is generally believed that the 18th Congress of the Communist Party, which will convene on March 10th, will discuss the abolition of the "Large-Scale Purge" case, a sign that Soviet internal affairs are returning to normal. The proposal stipulates that ordinary party members are permitted to publicly criticize senior party officials. Secret court trials are completely illegal and will be replaced by individual interrogations so that party members accused of violating party discipline can defend themselves. It is also reported that the struggle against capitalist elements has now been declared over, and the distinctions between workers, intellectuals, and farmers have been eliminated.

### Bishop Yu Pin Leaves France for the United States; Delivers a Speech Before Departure

Le Havre - Bishop Yu Pin of Nanjing, China, is traveling to the United States as a commissioner of the Refugee Relief Committee, chairman of the Catholic Relief Society, and representative of various charitable organizations in Shanghai, to appeal for help for the thirty million refugees in China and to express gratitude to various public and private charitable organizations for their aid to Chinese refugees over the past two years. Before departing from Europe, he visited Pope Pius XI in Rome, who highly praised his efforts. He was also encouraged by the French Society of the Divine Word. He boarded the "Paris" liner here this afternoon to travel to New York. He plans to stay in the United States for six months before returning to China. Before his departure, he made the following remarks to a Havas news agency reporter: (Reporter asked) How much longer will the Sino-Japanese war last? (Bishop Yu replied) "Judging by Japan's strength, I am afraid it will not be able to sustain the war for more than two years. If that country wants to control China, it must occupy all of China. Merely seizing some cities will not constitute victory, because China is an agricultural country, and its main lifeline is not in the cities. As it stands now, Japan only occupies the areas where its troops are stationed; the rest is still in Chinese hands." (Asked) In your opinion, how will the Sino-Japanese war end? (Answered) "Japan will not be able to end the war by force. One day, Japan will be the first to sue for peace." (Asked) If war breaks out in Europe, will Japan, in accordance with the Anti-Comintern Pact, come to the aid of Germany and Italy? (Answered) "Japan cannot conquer China; how can it have the strength to participate in another war?" (Havas, 1st)

### Britain Spare No Effort in Defence Arrangements

(London) The British government plans to divide the mainland into twelve districts in wartime. Sir Anderson, the Minister in Charge and Chairman of the Committee on Evacuation of Populations in Major Cities, announced that the British mainland would be divided into twelve districts in wartime, with England being divided into ten districts, and Scotland and Wales each forming one district. One commissioner will be assigned to each district. After the outbreak of war, all government functions, except military command, will be exercised by the committee. The specific plan for this measure will be completed soon and submitted to the Cabinet for approval on the first of next month. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

(London) The newly appointed British Secretary of State for War, Hore-Belisha, who previously led an investigation team to India for three months, has submitted a report to the government, revealing that the troops stationed in India will be completely reorganized. It is generally claimed that the British troops stationed in India will be directly under the control of the British War Office. (Haitong dispatch, 2nd)

### Palestine Conference to Open Next Week

(London) According to responsible sources,

The conference on the Palestine issue will be personally opened by Prime Minister Chamberlain next Tuesday morning. It is reported that the Prime Minister will address each delegation separately, and then the leaders of each delegation will formally reply. At that time, the delegations will not begin substantive talks in the meeting room until two or three days after the opening. Yesterday afternoon, Colonial Secretary MacDonald met with several Jewish representatives and will meet with representatives from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq in the evening. After discussion, it is expected that the language used in the conference will be determined to be three languages for all speeches, namely English, Arabic, and one other, presumably French. It is reported that the Palestine issue itself will be discussed after the talks formally begin next week. The delegations have been entertained by various parties in recent days, feeling very fatigued and unable to cope, so they have politely declined invitations from many places for the delegation. Dr. Weizmann, Mr. Ben-Gurion, Professor Namier, Mr. Hexter, and Mr. Lorie, representatives of the Jewish organizations participating in the conference, all met with MacDonald yesterday. The Jewish representatives from Palestine must arrive in England next Tuesday, so they will not be able to have the first discussion with the Jews until next Wednesday. It is expected that MacDonald and Under-Secretary Butler will frequently attend future meetings, while Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will only attend a few times.

### The Most American Aircraft Bought by France; German Newspapers Criticise Heavily

(Washington) According to the Department of Commerce's statistics today, France may become the largest customer of the American aircraft industry this year, as France recently ordered 100 "Curtiss" military aircraft, and the French Aviation Committee is currently negotiating with the American side to order another 600 aircraft, worth approximately $35,000,000. The Netherlands, Japan, and China were the major customers of American aircraft last year, with total exports amounting to $68,000,000. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)

(Washington) According to the Department of Commerce's statistics, nearly half of the aircraft and aircraft materials manufactured in the United States in 1938 were exported abroad, with a total value of $68,000,000. Of this, 44% was shipped to countries along the Pacific coast. By country, the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies were the largest customers, accounting for the first place, with a total purchase of $11,774,043. Japan ranked second, with a total purchase of $11,061,447. China ranked third, with a total purchase of $6,391,713. The rest were Argentina, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, the Commonwealth of Australia, and British Hong Kong Island. As for the orders already received by American aircraft factories this year, European countries are the largest customers. In addition, according to the Department of Commerce's statistics on the export volume of scrap metal from the United States last year, Japan purchased a total of 1,381,901 tons, Italy purchased a total of 437,025 tons, the United Kingdom purchased a total of 309,319 tons, and Germany purchased a total of 230,903 tons. The number of purchases by Japan, Italy, and Germany all increased compared to 1937, while the United Kingdom's decreased. (Havas, 1st)

(Berlin) Regarding the announcement by U.S. President Roosevelt in the Senate Military Committee that American aircraft companies were permitted to sell 600 of the latest American military aircraft to France for a price of $65 million, German newspapers have launched the most sharpest criticism, calling it a reckless attempt to incite a war spirit. The VÃ¶lkischer Beobachter (People's Observer) pointed out that the United States, due to its terrain that is not easily attacked by foreign countries, often takes the lead in maintaining peace. Since the World War, the American people have believed that their duty is to avoid getting involved in the European vortex, and therefore passed strict neutrality laws. However, today, the American people have disregarded these laws, and the entire United States is filled with elements inciting an anti-German movement. If their plan succeeds, it will drive the farmers of Pittsburgh and the workers of the Central West to shed their blood on distant battlefields. The Berliner BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung (Berlin Financial Newspaper) stated in even more violent terms, "Roosevelt's remarks surprise us more than once, but we do not believe that Hitler's speech to the Reichstag was published just twenty-four hours after Roosevelt responded with such a threat of war. Hitler's speech contained words that I believed would bring a long period of peace, which was a relief to the world. Why is President Roosevelt the only one who is unhappy about this? In short, Roosevelt's answer to the world's nations' desire for peace is to move the U.S. defense line to France. From this point of view, Roosevelt seems to regret that last September's crisis did not lead to an international armed conflict. He is certainly dissatisfied with the policies pursued by Chamberlain and Daladier, each in their own way. In his intention, he must persuade Britain and France to abandon all efforts to seek understanding with Germany. It can be seen that Roosevelt fundamentally ignores the Franco-German agreement, does not understand the true meaning of Hitler's declaration, and simply tries to support the democracies and oppose the German-Italian Axis." The newspaper concluded by saying that President Roosevelt is the greatest democratic protector of Bolshevism. (Haitong dispatch, 2nd)

(Berlin) The speech made by U.S. President Roosevelt yesterday to the members of the Senate Army Committee has triggered a fierce reaction here. The semi-official German News Agency (Deutsches NachrichtenbÃ¼ro) issued a message attacking President Roosevelt, stating that this speech is the most astonishing nonsense from responsible American authorities in some time. The President's intention is probably to counteract the great impression that Hitler's speech has made on the world. The FÃ¼hrer has strongly condemned warmongers and expressed his hope that lasting peace can be established. Does Roosevelt feel that he is among those being scolded and that his plans have been thwarted? As for the sale of 700 of the latest American aircraft to France, the intermediary was the U.S. Ambassador to France, William Bullitt, one of President Roosevelt's closest associates and a close friend of Lenin. Roosevelt, under his instigation, ordered Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., who is Jewish, to handle the matter. The Army and Navy authorities opposed it, but succumbed to pressure from the White House. Millions of decent Americans are now demanding a public investigation. This case will become an unprecedented scandal of the U.S. government. If someone else had done it instead of the President himself, it would be denounced as treason. It can be asserted that Roosevelt, having suffered repeated setbacks, wants to issue shocking remarks to divert national attention. If there is talk of the American border being in France, it is utter nonsense." In addition, all newspapers have vehemently criticized President Roosevelt, saying that he has formed an alliance with the Bolsheviks. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

### Foreign Residents in Hankou Must Show Residency Permits to Japanese Sentries

(Hankou) This afternoon, the Japanese Consulate in Hankou issued a notice stating that from February 10th, foreign residents in Hankou from third countries must show their residency permits when passing Japanese sentries. The purpose of this measure is to prevent accidents and to protect foreign residents from third countries. The military authorities wish to state that they will not be responsible for any unfortunate incidents that occur due to unwillingness to comply with this requirement. Although no anti-Japanese incidents have occurred in Hankou, security has been greatly tightened in the last three days. Starting at 2:00 p.m. today, the restrictions around the French Concession were eased to allow Chinese people to carry food to the best of their ability. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

### People in Chongqing Worried; Approaching End of the Anti-Air Raid Weather Season

(Chongqing) Residents of Chongqing are becoming increasingly worried as the season of clear skies approaches, fearing Japanese air raids. Chongqing's weather in winter is mostly cloudy and foggy, with sunshine only for a few days a month. Normally, this type of weather is disliked, but the residents of Chongqing welcome it because it prevents Japanese bombers from flying over. Here, the weather in Chongqing is called "anti-air raid weather" or "anti-Japanese weather." However, winter is coming to an end, and after the Lunar New Year on February 19th, the sun will shine all day long, and the weather will be clear, which is conducive to bombing by aircraft. Therefore, the residents of Chongqing are becoming increasingly uneasy. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

### Restoration of the Commissioner's Office; Unification of Administration in Nine Suburban Counties of Shanghai; County Magistrate Fei Gongxia and Others Have Arrived; Establishment of a Military Commissioner for Songhu

Punan Correspondence: When the Punan area fell last year, there was a period of chaos in the local area. After arduous struggles, the homeland was recovered within a few months, and order was gradually restored. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, recognizing the great importance of military and political facilities in various places, has specially restored the administrative system to its original state,

Establishment of the Commissioner's Office

The Third District Inspector Commissioner's Office and the Third District Headquarters of the Provincial Security Brigade have been established. All military and political matters in Pudongnan, as well as the counties of Chuan, Nan, Feng, Jin, and the suburban counties of Shanghai, Bao, Song, Jia, and Qing, are under the jurisdiction of the office. It has been reported to the National Government for official announcement. The county magistrates in the district have also been formally appointed by the Department of Civil Affairs, including Fei Gongxia of Songjiang, Hong Lanxiang of Baoshan, Zhou Xingbei of Shanghai, Ruan Kaiji of Fengxian, Tang Yaoyu of Chuansha, Sheng Pingzhi of Nanhui, Qian Letong of Jinshan, Ping Zuchun of Qingpu, and Teng Guobin of Jiading, all of whom arrived to take office a month ago. People's Self-Defense Corps have been organized in each county to maintain law and order, with the county magistrates serving as the corps commanders and under the control of the Provincial Security Brigade.

Reorganization of Various Armies

It is also learned from the Central Government that the existing troops in Pudongnan and the suburbs of Shanghai, who have defended the local area and made meritorious contributions, have complex organization and inconsistent names. Therefore, in order to strengthen the strength, Gu Zhutong, Commander of the Third War Area, has specially established the post of Military Commissioner for Songhu, which is concurrently held by the Inspector Commissioner of the Third Administrative District. All miscellaneous troops in various counties in the district and nearby areas are under the responsibility of the commissioner for reorganization. If the funds have not been available from local taxes, the commissioner will provide appropriate assistance. It is reported that the troops in Chuansha, Songjiang, Wusong, and other places have been formally reorganized by the commissioner into ten battalions in the near future, and they will continue to serve in their original positions. In the southeastern coastal areas, personnel have also been sent to handle the matter. In Jiading, it is estimated that one division of troops will be reorganized, with sufficient weapons. Therefore, the Commander of the Third War Area has approved the formal formation of the division and assigned it to a certain regiment of the Third War Area for command. As for the three branches of the Loyal and Patriotic Army stationed in Feng, Nan, and Chuan counties, they were originally under the control of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee and were of the nature of the National Defense Forces and not within the military scope of the commissioner.

Joint Defense of Five Counties

Recently, the troops of Feng, Nan, Chuan, Jin, and Song counties in Pudongnan have organized the Joint Defense Headquarters of Five Counties, mutually recommending Ding Xisan, commander of the Eighth Branch of the Loyal and Patriotic Army, as the commander-in-chief, and Qian Letong, head of the Jinshan County People's Self-Defense Corps, as the deputy commander, also serving as the Songhu Commissioner. Recently, Yu Taosheng, Ma Bosheng, and other key personnel of the Loyal and Patriotic Army in various counties have been hired as councilors of the office. On the one hand, Ding Xisan also serves as the deputy commander of the Third District People's Self-Defense Corps. Before the self-defense corps in Feng, Nan, and Chuan counties are formally established, local security has been discussed and assisted by the Loyal and Patriotic Army.

### Japanese Troops in Qingpu Kill Each Other; Burned Nine Towns and Villages in Revenge

Qingpu Correspondence: The Japanese troops in Qingpu, seeing that the guerrilla forces of Wei's unit outside the North Gate of Zhangyan Town were growing stronger, wanted to attack, but because their strength was insufficient, they did not advance. They then colluded with the Japanese troops stationed in Xujing and Huangdu to encircle and attack. On the 28th of last month, more than 20 Japanese troops in Qingpu disguised themselves as farmers and first went to the town to scout. Then, 70 or 80 Japanese troops and two platoons of pseudo-police were sent in eight speedboats to provide support. However, the disguised Japanese troops were mistaken for guerrillas by the Japanese troops in Huangdu and Xujing, who opened fire on them. The supporting troops in Qingpu, without careful observation, also believed that the advance party was attacked by guerrillas and swept the two Japanese forces in Huangdu and Xujing with machine guns. When the two sides were engaged in a fierce battle, the guerrillas realized what was happening and ordered an encirclement and attack. The Japanese troops committed suicide and were attacked from both sides, resulting in 150 or 160 casualties. The surviving Japanese troops returned to report to the special task force leader, Matsuoka. Matsuoka, in a fit of rage, again colluded with the Japanese troops in Huangdu, Xujing, Fangjiayao, and Beiganshan, preparing for a large-scale encirclement and attack. At 9 a.m. one day, Matsuoka personally led the Japanese and puppet troops from Qingpu to advance, but the guerrillas had heard about it in advance. In order to avoid wasting their strength, they had already left. When the Japanese troops encircled and attacked, they found nothing and could not find anything even after a thorough search. They vented their anger on the people and burned nine towns and villages, including Chonggu, Zhangyan, Old Qingpu, Shixianggong Temple, Yuantuanjing, Yujing, Qinglong Town, Hao'ao'an, and Xiwang Temple.

### Eastern Zhejiang Strictly Implements Winter Defense; Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo Are Under Martial Law; Foreign Ships Prohibited from Night Navigation

According to the New Sound Society, the Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo Defense Command in Eastern Zhejiang, in accordance with the order of the Tenth Army Group Headquarters, announced that martial law would be implemented and winter defense would be implemented from now on due to the tense period of winter defense and to strictly prevent traitors and bandits and consolidate the security of the rear. Foreign ships entering and exiting the Yong River, Jiao River, and Ou River are limited to daytime; night navigation is prohibited. Urban curfew hours are from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. the next morning. Rural curfew hours are from 7:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. at dawn. Land and water transportation are completely cut off. Those who do not hold special passes are not allowed to pass.

### The Second Year of the War of Resistance: Production and Sales of Sichuan Province Commodities (1) (Continued): Reduced Imports Due to Difficult Transportation; Worry of Stagnation in Local Product Sales Still Exists

Recently, due to the purchase of medicinal herbs by a certain influential figure, several medicinal materials, such as aconite, codonopsis, chuanxiong, angelica, rhubarb, and white peony root, have become extremely active in the market. At the same time, the Pharmaceutical Association is also preparing to organize a medicinal materials trading company, raising 200,000 yuan to carry out planned export trade. The Sichuan branch of the Southwest Industrial Association has also raised 200,000 yuan to set up a medicinal product refining company, intending to use scientific methods to refine Chinese medicine to meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets. The fifth most important product is sheepskin. In previous years, the export volume has always been two to three million pieces. Last year, due to various reasons, sheepskin companies did not provide advance loans for purchase, resulting in a smaller output, only over one million pieces in total. Only one million pieces were traded and shipped out, with a total value of about two to three million yuan. After the Yangtze River traffic was reduced, the value of goods transported and sold was only slightly more than one-third of the original. As for sheep wool, after the Yangtze River steamers shortened their routes, monthly sales were only slightly more than one percent of the original. The sales volume last year was too small to mention. However, from another perspective, Sichuan Province has a large backlog of sheep wool, which may not be a bad "business opportunity" for entrepreneurs.

Local Products for Transshipment: There are two types: Sichuan salt and Sichuan opium. Since the start of the War of Resistance, the Huai salt production areas have become war zones. The salt supply for the four provinces along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and part of Henan Province has relied on Sichuan salt. Therefore, Sichuan salt exports were extremely smooth last year. Subsequently, due to the capture of many export markets, and the insufficient sales of internal sales, which include both banks of the Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, all efforts were made to use the accumulated export salt for internal sales. Therefore, the Sichuan Salt Affairs Bureau only increased production in the Fu and Rong factories. It is estimated that over 1,000 loads were transported out through the five autumn customs for export, and the approved sales quota for internal sales was 1,770 loads for the five, autumn, and year customs combined. The average price of flower salt was 12,000 yuan per load, and the average price of Ba salt was 13,000 yuan per load. In total, the total business volume of Sichuan salt merchants last year was over 30 million yuan. Retail prices on each bank varied slightly due to distance and transportation costs. Wholesale sales are subject to government-approved price restrictions from the production area to transportation, so salt merchants cannot obtain as much profit as general merchants. This is the production and sales situation of Sichuan salt last year. As for Sichuan opium, the total business volume last year was over 3.7 million yuan. Although it is not a legitimate business, it still has its commercial value before it is completely banned, and it is actually a leader. The production area was limited to Fuling, Yihan, and Fengdu counties in the previous year, with a total output of 14,500 to 14,600 dan. Sales are also divided into internal and external sales. Internal sales are as high as 500 dan. Including smuggled opium, it is said that the actual number could be doubled. Before the fall of Hankou, external sales were 800 dan per month, but now it is very different from the past. The price of opium was only one yuan per tael when it first entered the market in the early years. After drying, adding labor and interest, the highest price was only one yuan and fifty or sixty cents. However, by July last year, it gradually rose to more than 3,000 yuan or even 4,000 yuan. Although the price of both new and old opium has fallen recently, less than 3,000 yuan per dan, due to the government's early ban on planting and increased tobacco taxes, there is still an upward trend. According to investigations, there are currently about 10,000 dan of new opium in Peiling, Yihan, Fengdu, and Dianjiang. Opium merchants who are not too bad at business can all make a profit. This is the production and sales situation of Sichuan opium last year.

Imported Goods: Among Chongqing's imports, cotton yarn has always ranked first. In 1936, the total import of cotton yarn reached more than 95,700 bales. In 1937, due to the war, it decreased to more than 88,100 bales, with a value of more than 22 million yuan. Last year, the total import volume to Chongqing was only over 43,000 bales (with another 5,000 bales temporarily stored in Yichang), but the price was twice as high as before the war. In January 1937, the price of a bale of 20-count Cailian was 308 yuan. Last year, the highest price of the same count of Lao Shiqiu rose to 910 yuan. The current market price is around 830 yuan (flower clothes and coarse flannel are priced at 105 yuan per dan, while fine flannel is only 95 yuan per dan. It is said that it is only 30 or 40 yuan per dan in Yichang). Due to the fluctuating price of yarn, more than 20 brokerage firms suddenly appeared last year to speculate in futures. The Agricultural Bank specifically established a yarn shop named Fushengzhuang to stabilize yarn prices. Now, except for Fushengzhuang, all yarn shops lack inventory, and there is a situation of supply falling short of demand. There are four cotton yarn mills relocated to Sichuan: Yuhua, Yufeng, Dacheng, and Qingxin (part of the Shenxin No. 4 Mill relocated to Chongqing). In addition, the Ministry of Military Affairs newly established a yarn mill, with a total of 100,000 spindles. However, they are currently under construction and preparation. Except for Qingxin, which has started the steel wire car, the other factories have not yet started work. Among them, Yuhua has the largest amount of goods and the best business. In addition to cotton yarn, the most important is cloth. In the previous year, the total import volume was more than 28,000 dan. The source of goods has always been mainly from foreign-owned factories or Sino-foreign joint ventures in Shanghai. Last year, the total import volume was only over 6,000 pieces, among which various colors of blue cloth, ha cloth, imitation serge, and imitation straight tribute cloth accounted for the majority.

School Overview

### Xinmin Middle School

Xinmin Middle School was founded in the spring of 1927. It has been in operation for twelve years. It was approved by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education and filed with the Ministry of Education in 1930. The school site has always been at the end of Xinshi Road, Jiangwan, covering an area of more than 20 mu. The dining hall is spacious, and the equipment is complete. There are three to four hundred students, most of whom live on campus, so management is convenient, and the school spirit is extremely strict. The school has both high school and junior high school departments. The high school is divided into general and business departments. Each grade only accepts boys and does not recruit girls. The January 28th Shanghai War broke out, Jiangwan became a war zone, the school buildings were destroyed, and the school equipment was lost, causing the achievements of years of struggle to be destroyed in one fell swoop. After efforts to revive the school, it was decided to restore the old appearance. Now the August 13th War broke out again, and the school was burned down again. However, the organizers of the school still take Mingde Xinmin as their responsibility and continue to work hard and become more energetic. In the fourth quarter of 1937, they borrowed 30 Huangjiasha Huayuan on Kader Road as a temporary school building, rushed to build it, and started school on time. Therefore, although the school has suffered a catastrophe, the singing has not stopped. The class time is in accordance with the old regulations, with full-day classes. The teachers in the school are graduates of famous universities from all over the country, with rich knowledge and serious teaching. Most of them have more than ten years of teaching experience. The students work hard, are courteous and obedient, and are tireless in academic research. In the last semester, they continued to publish the school magazine, publishing the academic works of each student and compiling them into a huge volume. Recently, the number of students in the school has increased sharply, and the school buildings are no longer sufficient. Therefore, the expansion plan is already being drafted, and it will be possible to promote its realization one by one in the near future.

### Charity Basketball Ends in Change: Mixed Team Loses to Mailing by Three Points, 25 to 28; Girls' Performance, Isolated Island Wins

The Sino-Western charity basketball game sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the mixed team played the second final against Mailing last night, still held in the China Youth Basketball Hall. The mixed team took the lead all the way, leading by two points in the first half, 13 to 11. Unexpectedly, in the last nine minutes, Chen Xianglong was fouled out four times. Due to miscalculation in the scheduling, the situation changed drastically, and Mailing suddenly rushed in five points. Although the lineup was changed again, it was finally helpless. Mailing came from behind and reversed the victory by three points, 28 to 25. Now Mailing and the mixed team have each won one game. The final final game will be held at the same place at 8:00 p.m. tomorrow night. Last night, Mailing was determined to win and went all out. The entire game was fought by Mailing's red team. The performance was much better than last time, so the game was unusually fierce from beginning to end, and was always in an extremely tense atmosphere. The performance cooperation of the mixed team was also better than the previous game. It can be said that Sun Huipei was the most outstanding. It is difficult to say who will win tomorrow night's third game. There was also a girls' performance game before the game last night. Using men's rules, the isolated island defeated the West League by 30 to 15 points. Chen Zaichun and Rong Mozhen were unusually brave, scoring a lot of points. The audience last night was more crowded than the previous game, with a total of seven or eight hundred people. The refugees benefited a lot.

Taking the Lead All the Way: After the girls' game, the mixed and Mailing teams followed. The mixed team responded with two Chens (Xianglong Xuechong), Cai Yanxiong, Sun Huipei, and Li Zhenzhong. Mailing responded with a pure red team. As soon as it circled, Chen Xuechong got the pass from Xianglong and had already jumped into the basket, and cheers rang out, setting a record. But Xianglong fouled, and Brain also got one point. Li Zhenzhong passed beautifully, and Xianglong reversed and lifted it up, which was extremely beautiful. The mixed team immediately took a 4-1 lead. So Pierce hit the basket in the air and chased it to three against four. Permand shot from the corner and hit, and Wilder continued to hit. Xuechong blocked people under the basket and won three points in one breath, becoming eight to four, and was taken the lead instead. At this time, the mixed team quickly replaced Li Zhenzhong with Zhou Dayun. Zhou scored as soon as he came on the field, and Xianglong returned and lifted it in, chasing it to eight each. Mailing transferred Muliang and transferred Pierce. Li Zhenzhong also came on the field again to replace Xianglong, and his morale was greatly boosted. Brown fouled, Zhou Dayun penalized one point, and Sun Huipei returned and entered the basket with one hand. Dayun waved his left hand and broke the enemy's basket, 13 to 9, and the mixed team took a four-point lead. In the first half of the break, Wilder jumped up and threw it in. The first half ended, and the mixed team led by two points with a score of 13 to 11.

Golden Age: Switching baskets and fighting again, the personnel on both sides did not change much, and the situation of the battle was still controlled by the mixed team. Less than a minute after the start of the game, Chen Xuechong used his quick and lightning-fast old technique to enter the basket with one hand. Moore also returned the color, and Sun Huipei entered the bottom of the basket, making a contribution and returning, becoming 17 to 13, and the mixed team took the lead. At 19 to 16, the mixed team called a timeout and transferred Li Zhenzhong to supplement Xianglong. As expected, Sun Huipei scored in one fell swoop. Although Mailing played with Maituojie and others, they still could not have a good performance. Sun Huipei was like a lively dragon and fierce tiger, making two penalties and scoring both. Cai Yanxiong shot from a distance and advanced smoothly, 23 to 16, and the mixed team took a lead of seven points. It was indeed the golden age of the mixed team in yesterday's game. But an unexpected disaster came, and Xianglong appeared for the fourth time. Lu Zhongen, a resourceful man, was transferred up, and then the doom came.

Dramatic Change in the Situation: The situation suddenly changed drastically, and Mailing even scored five points in a row in the chaos. Brown scored a penalty, Saqin's free shot also hit, Maituojie scored a penalty, plus another throw, 22 to 23, the difference was only one point, and the situation was extremely tense. At this time, the mixed team urgently transferred Li Zude to replace Lu Zhongen, and made a mistake again and again, losing everything. Although Sun Huipei scored two penalties, in an instant, Brown chased to 24 to 25, and Moore lifted it up, and the Mailing team finally raised its head and won one point instead. There were still two and a half minutes left at the time. Although the mixed team shouted a timeout, the players' psychology had already been affected. Pierce shot from the bottom corner, 28 to 25, and the Mailing team established a winning situation. In the end, Li Zhenzhong and Zhou Dasha's two long shots were both a hair's breadth away, 28 to 25, and a good winning situation fell into the hands of others.

Finance: European Situation Relaxes, Gold Price Increase Resumes. Tianjin and Hong Kong Groups Compete to Purchase, High of 2037 Yuan.

The spot gold market experienced a sudden expansion in price increases yesterday. Since the European situation has relaxed, people's confidence has generally improved. In addition, the foreign exchange rate continues to tighten due to the collusion of North China United Bank and foreign banks. As a result, the wealthy in this city have become more eager to purchase and hoard gold. Moreover, the Tianjin group entrusted a certain money exchange firm to aggressively purchase gold, and the Hong Kong group secretly continued their activities. Fortunately, the gold shops and silver shops supplied gold in the morning, so the price increase was relatively slow. In the afternoon, a giant in the securities group also came to follow and search for gold. Although the silver shops and money exchange firms continued to sell, the supply was still insufficient to meet the demand. Furthermore, buyers were willing to pay high prices and compete to purchase, which led to a sharp increase in prices, reaching a daily high of 2,037 yuan at closing. As a result, confidence in all quarters was greatly increased, and trading was also active. The price of gold ornaments in silver shops also increased twice, and customs gold bars and Sino-British pure gold also rebounded and increased in price.

Spot Gold Increases by Fifteen Yuan

From the morning, the initial price quoted by sellers was 2,024 yuan per tael (ten liang). Buyers bid 2,021 yuan. Both sides negotiated until after 10:00 AM, when buyers became more eager to purchase due to rumors that the foreign exchange rate had softened after being manipulated by the North China United Bank and foreign banks. Initially, a certain money exchange firm purchased 50 taels from a gold shop and a silver shop purchased 100 taels, with a starting price of 2,024 yuan. Subsequently, a gold shop purchased another 50 taels at 2,025 yuan, and a silver shop purchased 50 taels at 2,024 yuan (reportedly, all of the above purchases were made on behalf of the Tianjin and Hong Kong groups). Shortly after, a silver shop, also acting on behalf of the Hong Kong group, purchased 50 taels each from a fellow silver shop and a gold shop at the same price. Later, the silver shop purchased another 50 taels from a fellow silver shop at 2,025 yuan. The same price was seen when a money exchange firm purchased 10 taels each from a fellow money exchange and a gold shop. Later, a certain money exchange firm purchased 90 taels from a gold shop at 2,027 yuan. By this time it was already past 11:00 AM. Thereafter, the supply became scarce, and although buyers continued to bid 2,027 yuan, no sellers were willing to supply. Therefore, it was difficult to make a deal until noon, and the noon closing price was 2,027 yuan. At 2:10 PM in the afternoon, a money exchange firm purchased 50 taels from the North Group at 2,028 yuan, and another 50 taels from a silver shop at 2,028.5 yuan. Thereafter, the foreign exchange rate continued to tighten due to manipulation by foreign banks, which further intensified the buying in the market. Most sellers were hesitant to sell, so the price jumped to over 2,030 yuan. A certain money exchange firm purchased another 50 taels from a silver shop at 2,032 yuan, and another 50 taels from a silver shop at 2,033 yuan. At that time, the North Group suddenly came to purchase again, which further sharpened the price increase. The North Group purchased 50 taels from a gold shop for 2,037 yuan. Subsequently, money exchange firms slightly sold at high prices, and then slightly retreated. Money exchange firms mutually traded 20 taels at 2,036 yuan, and another 50 taels at 2,035 yuan. Later, a securities group suddenly became interested in buying, so the price repeatedly increased. A securities group purchased 50 taels from a silver shop at 2,035 yuan, and another 20 taels from a money exchange firm at 2,037 yuan, and then another 50 taels from a money exchange firm at 2,037 yuan. Later, they still wanted to purchase more, but they couldn't find a counterparty, so a deal couldn't be made. Therefore, the evening closing price was still 2,037 yuan, which was 15 yuan higher than yesterday's. The selling price of gold from cash shops was 2,045 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,030 yuan. The spot gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and no deals were made.

Gold Ornaments Changed to More Expensive Twice

The selling price of gold ornaments in silver shops was not changed at first. However, at 11:00 AM, due to the strong stability of spot gold, the price was increased by one yuan. Later, at 4:25 PM, due to the sudden increase of spot gold to near 2,040 yuan, the price was increased by another yuan. Datonghang Laokingyun and other stores changed the selling price to 207 yuan, new stores changed the selling price to 205 yuan, and the purchase price was 199 yuan.

Pure Gold Fluctuated Suddenly

According to a London dispatch, the price of British pure gold suddenly rebounded by one and a half pence per ounce, reaching Â£7, 8 shillings, and 7.5 pence. As a result, the central bank's purchase price of Chinese cash also rebounded to 1,213.3 yuan. The listed customs gold price also increased by three cents, which is 2.397 yuan. The Shanghai spot gold price also rebounded by one yuan, amounting to 1,208.6 yuan.

### "United Bank" Resumes Absorption. Foreign Exchange Rate Tightens Briefly. Later, Due to Foreign Telegram Sales, the Situation Slightly Improved.

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was quite tight due to the absorption by a certain broker on behalf of the Preparatory Bank of North China and the fierce competition among major foreign banks. The British gold rate once retreated to 8 pence and 2.96875. The US dollar rate also softened to 16.125 yuan. However, the result was not severely tight because the foreign telegrams and the Chinese banks competed to sell. There were many fluctuations and active transactions. Although the Hong Kong exchange rate still had a strong appetite for banks, the money exchange firms were still willing to supply, so there was no significant difference.

Initially in the morning, the London telegraph rate narrowed in near and far terms. The New York silver price remained flat. The London gold price increased by one and a half pence. The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar was 0.06, and the exchange rate with France and Shanghai remained unchanged. The US dollar rate increased by 0.0625 against the pound, decreased by 0.0625 against France, and remained flat against Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the bank's early opening, the selling price of the British exchange rate was 8 pence and 3.328125, and the selling price of the US dollar was 16.21875 yuan, both unchanged compared to the previous closing price. After the opening, the North China United Bank strongly purchased foreign banks' US dollars at 16.21875 yuan and British gold at 8 pence and 3.3125. Therefore, the situation gradually tightened. The HSBC listing was announced unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be slightly half a cent. After that, foreign banks, including Dutch Bank, American Bank, and HSBC, purchased British gold at 8 pence and 3.328125 and US dollars at 16.1875. As a result, the process softened. Near noon, a money exchange firm suddenly sold US dollar bills at 16.375 yuan to China-Italy Bank and Dutch Bank, and also sold Hong Kong exchange at 56.125 yuan to China-America and Anda Banks. As a result, the situation began to turn loose. The noon closing price of the bank was 8 pence and 3.3125 for British exchange and the same as the morning opening price of 16.21875 yuan for the US dollar.

Later in the afternoon, the American Bank and foreign banks competed to purchase foreign telegrams and Chinese banks' British gold at 8 pence and 3.3125 and US dollars at 16.1875. Later, the British gold rate was softened to over 8 pence and 2.96875, and the US dollar rate was tightened to over 16.125 yuan. Therefore, the situation became tighter. Later, foreign telegrams and Chinese banks jointly competed to sell British gold at 8 pence and 3.3125 and US dollars at 16.1875. In addition, foreign banks' settlement of accounts decreased, which loosened the situation. Only Dutch Bank purchased 56 yuan of Hong Kong exchange from money exchange firms, which slightly softened the situation. By the evening closing price, the bank's selling price was 8 pence and 3.3125 for British exchange and 16.1875 yuan for US dollars. As a result, the British exchange rate was reduced by 0.015625 and the US exchange rate was tightened by 0.03125 compared to the previous closing price. The Hong Kong exchange rate did not change.

Strong Demand for British and American Gold Notes

Yesterday, the British pure gold rebounded by one and a half pence, and the British and American exchange rates rebounded by 0.0625. Foreign banks' settlement of foreign exchange was very active, but the banks' supply was not smooth. The market price gradually increased and the trend was weak. Hong Kong groups were very active in absorbing spot gold, and the wealthy were very interested in buying, but few people were willing to sell their profits, so there was a shortage of chips. The market price increased sharply and the closing price was firm. It is expected that the future of spot gold will continue to be high. The wealthy were very active in searching for foreign currencies, and the demand for British and American gold notes was strong. There was also strong demand for Dutch notes. The supply of various currencies was not smooth, and the market price increased. The association's transactions were still active. Ding Yuan sold Hong Kong notes to Changtai for 700 yuan. Qintai sold Dutch notes to Baocheng for 100 yuan. Yingfeng sold British gold notes to Hongchang for Â£50. Yikang sold Dutch notes to Baocheng for 100 yuan.

Only Canadian notes, Italian notes, German gold notes, Australian gold notes, and Siamese notes did not change.

Telegraph Transfer Declined for Three Consecutive Days

According to a London dispatch, speculators sold more than they bought, the market was still flat, and the closing price was still flat. Buyers paid the listed price, and sellers were willing to supply only if the price was 0.0625 higher. The near and far term telegraph transfer rate narrowed by 0.0625. According to the New York silver telegram, the American silver price remained unchanged. Also, Indian silver was closed and there was no market.

Discount Rate Dropped Slightly by Half a Corner

Yesterday, the discount rate for draft bills slightly decreased. The daily rate was still fluctuating between 36 and 37 yuan per thousand yuan. The lowest rate in the morning was 36.25 yuan, and the rate in the afternoon was 36.5 yuan, which was half a yuan lower than the previous day.

### Securities: Unified Class A Drawing as Scheduled, Bond Market Like the Sun Emerging from Clouds, All Prices Rebounded

The securities gray market situation yesterday was very active, and the rebound continued strongly. The sluggish and gloomy atmosphere of the past two weeks suddenly became clear, because after the recent announcement of interest payments, and as the Class A drawing approached, there were no other changes. Yesterday, the Fund Custody Committee also announced that it had received an order from the Ministry to hold the Class A drawing as scheduled. The rumors of the short sellers suddenly became ineffective. This newspaper has also repeatedly stated that these rumors were nothing more than baseless fabrications. However, due to the empty sentiment and continuous price declines, there was no factual proof. Now that the Ministry's order has been issued, it is like the sun emerging from the clouds and all the shadows disappearing. However, the market price has fallen for a long time, and the interest rate has already decreased by 13 or 14 yuan compared to the high price, which is enough to attract general investment. It is also a fact that it is most cost-effective for general retail investors to replenish what they had previously sold. Therefore, even if there are no huge price increases in the future, at least it can be stabilized after the end of this decline.

Yesterday's process: the opening of Class E felt lifeless. In the middle of the day, a certain bank suddenly bought a large amount, which was handled by Zhang, and the market situation suddenly turned high. In addition, the 15th and 35th also rushed to buy, and the rising trend became stronger. The selling atmosphere was weak, and the 10th still sold at high prices, and Tongkang also sold some, but the supply and demand were very different. The situation in the afternoon was still very firm, and a certain bank continued to buy, and the majority of retail investors were also interested, and the atmosphere seemed to be very good. It rose by three corners again, and the results all continued to rise, ranging from six and a half corners to one and a half yuan. Among them, Class D rose more because it had not been done the previous day. The total turnover was nearly one million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading has become quiet again. Most of the sellers in the market are scarce, and it is not easy for buyers to find opponents, so most of them are still in solicitation.

Yesterday's stock transaction, the number of shares of China Bookstore shares was 10 shares, and the character "ten" was mistakenly printed as "thousand", which is now corrected.

The London China Foreign Debt Principal and Interest List on the 1st (Wednesday), the prices of all debts have not changed, and the trend seems to have become stable. As for the supply of real goods, only the railway bonds have a little decoration. The Hukwang Railway Bonds, whether they are printed debt tickets or printed winning tickets, each 2,000 pounds, the selling prices are both 22 pounds and 5 shillings, which is slightly higher than the market price by five shillings. The original Tsienpu Railway Bonds, whether they are German-issued debt tickets or German-issued winning debt tickets, each 1,000 pounds, and the continued issuance of bonds, German-issued printed debt tickets, 3,000 pounds, all sold for 16 pounds and a half, which is half a pound higher than the market price. Also, the Marconi Wireless Bonds, 1,500 pounds, the selling price is 12 pounds and a half, and the buying price is 12 pounds.

The London English Merchants' Far East Companies Stocks Market List on the 1st of this month (Wednesday), the HSBC Bank shares continued to rise, including the English Registered shares rising by half a pound, the price being 84 pounds, and the Hong Kong registered shares rising by one pound, the price being 86 and a half pounds, and the rest have not changed.

Shanghai Loan Investment Co., a British merchant at No. 1 Bund in this city, convened a board meeting on the 1st of this month to discuss the profit distribution plan for last year.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Speculators Are Still Pulling in on Dips, While Japanese Yarn Is Falling Step by Step

The yarn market is stable, and the actual demand is still clear. As the end of the year is approaching, the various groups have no intention of collecting and purchasing, so the actual digestion is normal. General speculators have a strong intention to accumulate andé¢ low prices, they still come to absorb, so most of the spot goods in the market are bought by them, and the spot chips are instead felt to be short. In fact, most of them have advanced funds to the warehouse. It is expected that there is a prospect of soaring in the coming spring, and of course they will close and not release now, and their attitude is as stable as a rock.

The situation in the current yarn market today. Those who are concerned about the early morning opening are still gathered as usual, but the visiting customers have no great appetite, so it was not until after 10:00 that it opened. The market price opened at 2 yuan, and 20-count Double Horse spot goods were 394 yuan. Only 5 bales were traded among peers, and the warehouse order price was 390 yuan. After a while, the price was slightly released at a high price, and then slightly dropped by 1 yuan, but the speculators and Yu Rongjie still came to eat in, but the amount was not as large as before. The closing price was high, and the price of 20-count Double Horse was 394.5 yuan. According to the morning transaction statistics, 685 bales were traded, and the transactions among peers accounted for more than two-thirds, and the actual sales were only 140 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse was 2.5 yuan higher than the previous day, Double Earth was 1.5 yuan higher, Lao Jincheng was 3 yuan higher, Baxian was 8 yuan higher, and Flying Tiger was 2 yuan higher. The factory did not take any action. 350 pieces of export cotton yarn were transported to Shantou, 95 pieces were transported to Hong Kong, 85 pieces were transported to Guangzhou Bay, and 200 pieces were transported to Haiphong. 65 pieces of imported North Sand came. The amount of each group's purchase is recorded as follows:

The Japanese yarn market is increasingly declining, because the actual demand is not strong, and no one enters or exits the football trading, and the market situation is temporarily suspended. The football trading of last month, after mediation, has obtained a considerable method, and there is no problem. Therefore, the market is gradually declining, and the bearish trend is very strong. The spot price of 20-count Shuiyue is 321 yuan to 20 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Lanfeng is 318 yuan to 16 yuan, which is 3 to 4 yuan lower than the previous day.

### After the Suspension of Procurement: Domestic and Foreign Cotton Market

Foreign cotton market prices, New York cotton market, because the factory is waiting for the development of Washington news, has suspended procurement for many days. Yesterday there were more transactions, so the market price rose sharply by 4 to 5 pound sounds. India was closed yesterday, and it is predicted to fall by half a Robbie. Egypt rose by 30 pound sounds yesterday. Yesterday's exchange rate was weaker, and the converted legal tender cotton price, calculated that American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 7 corners per load, and Egyptian cotton was fierce.

### Grain: Lack of Flour Base, Wheat Price Tight

Recently, the factories have gradually reduced their raw material preparations for the flour market. The foreign wheat orders have been postponed again and again. The domestic wheat price is high and there is no large amount. Moreover, the end of the year is approaching, and the number of flour production is not much. There is a lack of existing base, and the supply is felt to be insufficient. The sporadic consumption by visiting customers is still not weakening, and the market is secretly tight. The unified market sold more than 20,000 bags of No. 2 flour, and the price was still 4 yuan and 8 corners. The North-South and local street wholesale each took one-third. There are still 10,000 bags of No. 5 white bags, which were handled by the Beiyang group, and the price was Tianyuan triangular cloud. Yesterday, 17,700 bags of flour were exported to Shantou.

Yesterday, the wheat market remained firm, and the source from the Yangtze River was still sparse. The cargo owners were all waiting for a good price to sell, and they did not want to compromise. The factories had no intention of lowering prices to buy because the foreign wheat orders would arrive soon. The market did not break away from the state of tension. The number of transactions in the unified market increased slightly compared to before. A total of 3,000 bags of Jiangbei and Wuhu wheat were traded, of which 1,000 bags were handled by the Fufeng factory and 2,000 bags were handled by the Fuxin factory. The highest price of Jiangbei wheat was still 6 yuan, 5 corners and 5 cents, and the price of Wuhu yellow skin wheat was 6 yuan, 2 corners and 5 cents to 6 yuan. The market was tight.

### Dumi's Future Market Suffers Twice, and the Price of Visiting Customers' Indica Rice Has No Major Fluctuations

The source of domestic rice is still sparse, and the goods from the river have not yet arrived at the port. There are only more than 2,000 bags of wheelbarrow rice, so there is still some surplus at the early market opening. The sellers' shouts are quite high, and the sales market in this street is still active. The speculators' handling is still small. The early market sentiment is quite good, but the evening market suddenly turns lax, resulting in a market setback. The results are only showing a fixed situation. There is not much entry or exit for thick and thin japonica rice. Du Yangjian and Bukit Jian still maintain the original market. Although the source of Bian Yuan goods is limited, the sales route is not as strong as the previous days, and the price is also lacking inè½©è½¾.

The situation of visiting customers' indica rice: because there was a slight turning point the previous day, there were scattered small households seeking to leave the market with the market, and the source of wheel source is still continuous, and the market is resuming. However, large households and hawkers are still unwilling to sell at low prices, and small households who are anxious to sell are also unwilling to sell at a loss. Therefore, there is a slight pinning situation in the fatigue. The unified market transaction is about 1,000 bags, and the market price is not much different from the previous market, with a rise of more than 2 yuan and 7 corners, and a fall of 1 corner in Indian cotton.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading is gradually entering a quiet state. There were no transactions yesterday, because the end of the year is approaching, and the sales of yarn and cloth are scarce. The prices of yesterday are listed separately below.

Yesterday, a large cotton store in this city received a telegram from the New York headquarters on the 1st, stating that the government's agricultural legislation may be difficult to promulgate and implement in the recent one or two months. There is a small demand for American cotton in all countries, but domestic sales have surged, and the consumption amount in the previous month was 600,000 bales.

The cotton business is completely in a state of stagnation. All parties are preparing to end the year and celebrate the New Year. This year, all industries have been prosperous and wealthy, so the market closure is earlier than in previous years. The market price is slightly sluggish due to the cooling demand, but the source is still blocked, and the existing base is not thick. The arrival of goods from the Subei side is becoming rare and thin. There are 704 bales of general cotton arriving at the dock, 30 pieces arriving from Niantuo Port, and 150 pieces are exported to Hong Kong, and 60 pieces are exported to Haikou. The spot cotton transaction record is left below.

### Piece Goods: Yunnan Groups Handle Domestic Cloth More Vigorously, and Eastern Piece Goods Are Wary of Selling Short

The sales of domestic cloth to visiting customers are mostly weak, but the factories have received huge orders, and there is no surplus for the month. The goods in the hands of peers and speculators are also unwilling to sell cheaply, but the spot goods of retail investors are slightly cheaper, showing a state of outer relaxation and inner tightness. The selling prices of various goods on the market are stable. The prices of goods with thin inventories, such as underwear and Hengfeng Factory's 84 original cloth, have increased by another corner. The price of Tianjin Hengyuan Factory's artillery car fine twill has increased by 2 corners due to the exhaustion of stocks in Shanghai. The sales to visiting customers are more vigorous in Yunnan, and nearly 200 boxes of bleached and dyed cloths and 50 bales of coarse cloth 84 original cloth have been traded. The Yong groups have purchased more than 130 bales of coarse cloth and fine twill from Yihua, Dasheng, Shenxin, and Hengyuan factories. This street has purchased nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth from Yihua and Hua factory's 9-pound coarse cloth. The Wenzhou group has also handled 50 pieces of blue cloth, color twill, coarse cloth, etc. The Quanzhou and Shantou groups have handled more than 80 pieces of color cloth, tick cloth, bleached cloth, and coarse cloth.

The actual sales of eastern cloth continue to be weak, and the decline of fine cloth and fine twill spot goods has not stopped. Because the peers are selling their hands easily, the price of each piece of fine cloth has dropped by another corner. The fine twill is relatively tougher. Although there are sporadic small amounts, they are also cut out, and the route of dyeing blanks in this street is still acceptable, so the bulls' shouts are still unmoved. The market has been less productive since the blow from Qichanghao's liquidation, and it is far from what it used to be. Those who buy short and sell short are wary, and the number of transactions is extremely small. Yesterday, the foreign companies still did not open any goods, but the dyeing factories in this street, which have a strong appetite, handled 500 to 600 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill of various brands, which made the selling price in the future market stronger again.

Today's piece goods exports include 230 pieces to Shantou, 3 pieces to Hong Kong, 90 pieces to Haimen, and 280 pieces to Haiphong.

### Western Suits and Woolen Fabric Sales Market Is Still Prosperous, and the Standard Market Price Rose Sharply Again Yesterday

Yesterday, the transaction of woolen fabrics was only healthy for the western clothing industry, and there were few other transactions. Yesterday, there were also many transactions of horse tails, printed western cloth, French shirts, etc. The standard market price suddenly rose sharply again, because there are more people inside and outside the industry collecting and receiving now than in previous years, and the stock of foreign company numbers is extremely short, and the foreign exchange rate has tightened, and the pricing of Yihua Factory and Shen Textile Products has suddenly become more expensive. Therefore, although the sales to visiting customers are rare, the standard market price suddenly sees a rise. Yesterday, the price of 55 medium-thick serge has risen by 8 and a half yuan, the price of battleship serge is 5 yuan and 8 and a half corners, Rongkang's boiled water US sale is 8 and a half yuan, and the tax-free goods of 559 yuan's direct tribute have risen sharply by 5 and a half corners (the previous lowest price was 3 yuan and 8 corners).

### Oil Cakes: Bean Cake Transactions Have Lost Interest, and a Batch of Nanyang Handled Raw Oil

The oil cake market and sales have lost interest, and the market situation has little ups and downs. Bean cakes are sold because the factories are taking into account the frequent rise in bean prices, and most of them are unwilling to sell cheaply, and the sales are weak because the end of the year is approaching. Therefore, the Shantou group has already been bound, and only Xiamen is still inquiring, but it is only a matter of rushing to load the ship. Yesterday, the market did not hear of any sales, and the route of bean oil continued to decrease, and the market price was also fresh. Yesterday, the paper traded 30 barrels of current Da Su oil, the price opened at the original market of 28 yuan, 1 corner and a half, and ordered 100 barrels for delivery in 7 days, the price was 28 yuan, 1 corner. There were other peer-to-peer sales and purchases, and 50 barrels were ordered for shipment in the first half of March, the price was 28 yuan and 3 and a half corners. There are more than two peanut oils arriving, and the market has declined. Yesterday, a batch of canned oil was handled by the Nanyang group, and 500 cans of Qingdao canned raw oil were sold at 29 yuan and 9 corners, 400 cans of Qingkou canned raw oil were sold at 30 yuan and 2 corners, and 150 cans of Yantai canned raw oil were also sold at 30 yuan and 2 corners.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Transactions Are Depressed

Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market was still weak, and the association's quotation was extremely deserted. The existing goods of 24 Dutch crude white outer warehouse were quoted at 24 yuan, 24 yuan and 2 corners for this warehouse, and 24 yuan and 4 corners for Dakin coarse, with few buyers. The existing goods of Taikoo Sugar B Mike East Warehouse were 23 yuan and 5 corners, and the barge delivery was 23 yuan and 6 corners, and the transaction was also limited. As the end of the year is approaching for domestic sugar, the firms are not in a hurry to re-enter, and although the market price has not changed much, it has shown a slight relaxation. Gao Huanggang Qing, dozens of bags were drawn out by the waiting firm, and the Chao group shouted at 13 yuan and a half, but no transaction was made. The price of red turning slightly opened was 14 yuan. The higher-priced decision white of the Jian group shouted at 21 yuan and was not made. It is heard that the price of Xinghua Dagong powder to be applied and drawn must be 24 yuan and a half, and the upper red is 17 yuan, which are difficult to calculate.

Today, 60 bags of sugar will be transported to Xingang, and the export to Qingdao will be slightly accommodated.

### North and South Goods: Raw Peanuts and Peanut Products Prices Both Loosen, Qingdao Exports Slightly More Accommodating

Qingdao Correspondent: The arrival of new raw peanuts in the area has been relatively strong recently, with 2,000 to 3,000 packages arriving daily. Market inventories are estimated to be 50,000 packages in total. Prices have loosened slightly, with over 7,000 packages transacted at $10.40, purchased by foreign firms and oil mills. Other transactions include large-sized peanuts at $11.20 for 1,300 packages.

Peanut inventories are relatively low, totaling 20,000 packages. Recently, foreign firms have been inactive, and the demand from Shanghai businesses has been weak. Recently, peanuts from Gaomi were offered at $8.20 for 1,600 packages, and peanuts from Wangtai were offered at $7.80, but no transactions were made. Inquiries have been made about export procedures for peanuts in the area. Currently, procedures are slightly more accommodating, requiring only a report to the cooperative, which then requests permission, and goods can be loaded. Previously, payment was required in advance, but now import payments for Southern goods can be used to offset the cost, making it more convenient. However, external fees remain the same and are difficult to reduce.

Yesterday, 224 packages of dates arrived from Tianjin, and 150 bundles of dried vermicelli arrived from Yantai. Today, 800 packages of raw peanuts are being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Seafood: Kelp Supply and Demand in Equilibrium

Kelp arrivals have been consistent recently, and sales are good. Yesterday, a batch of "Dragon Teeth" kelp was offered at prices ranging from $18.20 to $18.80 and $19.00. The market is stable.

### Fresh Mushrooms Very Scarce

Freshly cultivated mushrooms are very scarce due to limited supply. Yesterday, ten packages were sold, with high-grade mushrooms at $225.80 and regular mushrooms at $210.09, up $10 from the previous market price.

### Medicinal Materials: Guangdong Patchouli's Sales Gradually Expanding

Due to seasonal factors, Guangdong patchouli has been quiet for a long time, with the lowest price only around $10 per dan (a unit of weight). Recently, merchants from the north have been purchasing it, revitalizing the market. Yesterday, 70 to 80 packages were transacted at $14. According to brokerage houses, inventories are no more than 200 packages. However, with the arrival of spring, sales are expected to increase, so people are holding on to their stocks, unwilling to sell cheaply.

### Star Anise Supply Temporarily Cut Off, Prices High at $100

Previously, star anise prices fell from $100 to $84 due to excessive arrivals. However, continuous demand from various businesses has nearly exhausted the stock. As a result, local inventories are less than 100 packages, and suppliers seem unlikely to continue sourcing, as they have difficulty making a profit based on previous sale prices. This has led to a temporary supply disruption and tightening market conditions. The current market price is a high $100, and a transaction is expected soon.

### Silk and Tea: Domestic and Foreign Silk Prices Surge

Yesterday, the foreign silk market surged again in Japan and the United States. New York's 83-cent Japanese silk rose by 5 cents, and 75-cent Japanese silk rose by 4 cents. Shanghai's "B" grade white filature rose by 5 cents, and Guangdong silk rose by 2 cents. Exchange futures prices rose by 4 cents for both near and far terms. Yokohama spot prices rose by another $17, and futures rose by $11. The local silk market has become increasingly heated as a result. Users were offering $1460 for 18/20 white filature yesterday, and dry cocoons have risen to $360, reaching an unprecedented high. Foreign firms' transactions in English, French, and American white filature are unable to develop. Indian tussah silk continues to sell well, with prices up $30. A total of 20 piculs were transacted, and users estimated they could do 30 piculs. Yesterday, 35 pieces were exported to Yantai.

### January Statistics for New York Raw Silk

The monthly statistics for New York raw silk inventory and sales last month were revealed yesterday by Reuters. The statistics indicate that New York's raw silk imports decreased sharply, while consumption increased. The former is due to the upcoming New Year holiday for Japanese silk factories and the direct impact of raw material shortages in Japan. The latter is due to increased demand for silk from American mills producing spring and summer fabrics. The inventory, sales, and import figures for New York raw silk are excerpted below (unit: piculs):

### Coal: Matsuura Bituminous Coal Inventory Increases

The supply of Matsuura bituminous coal has suddenly increased recently. A foreign firm recently brought in a new shipment of over 2,000 tons to be transported through a certain route and stored in warehouses in Pudong, totaling 6,000 to 7,000 tons with the existing inventory. As a result, the stockpiles are difficult to move. However, suppliers are unwilling to lower prices lightly due to cost considerations. Competitors are offering screened lump coal at $43 per ton, run-of-mine coal at $41, and coal dust at $37, which is more expensive than Indian coal in the grey market.

### Case of Japanese Illegal Detention of Foreign Vessels: British Consulate to Lodge Protest, Captain of Yongzhen Relays Details of Detention

Regarding the case of the three foreign vessels, Yongzhen, Haida, and Hafia, being illegally detained by Japanese warships, the British Consulate General in Shanghai has taken it seriously. The owner of the Yongzhen, Mr. Mallet, was questioned on the afternoon of the day before yesterday about the detention. A strong protest will be lodged with the Japanese side. The Norwegian vessel Hafia arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao yesterday morning, and the Haida is expected to arrive tomorrow morning. The following is a report by a reporter from the Modern News Agency:

British Consulate Questioned About Detention

According to shipping industry sources, the British Consul General in Shanghai summoned the British owner of the Yongzhen, Mr. Mallet, to the consulate on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The Yongzhen was illegally detained by a Japanese warship near the Yanghekou River mouth near Haizhou on the 27th of last month and forced to sail to Qingdao. Although it was released after negotiations, the questioning was to clarify the detention process. The consular judge questioned Mr. Mallet, first asking if there were any contraband items on the Yongzhen. He replied, "No." He was then asked, "Do you know that Britain and Japan are not at war?" He replied, "No." He was then asked, "Since you know that we are not at war, the Japanese side naturally has no right to detain British merchant ships. Why did you obey their orders and sail to Qingdao?" He replied, "Because I was forced by strong coercion and could not resist." He was then asked about the detention in Qingdao and the business losses. The consular judge deemed the case clear and dismissed Mr. Mallet.

Preparing to Lodge a Strong Protest with Japan

According to reliable sources obtained by a reporter from the Modern News Agency, the Japanese side's detention of the British vessel was completely without legal basis and was clearly intended to squeeze out the interests of British residents. Although the Japanese side claimed it was a matter for the Qingdao Customs authorities, the detention occurred near the Yanghekou River mouth near Haizhou, which is under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. If the Customs authorities deemed it necessary to detain the vessel, it should have been sailed to Shanghai for inspection by the Jianghai Customs, which would have been legal. The fact that it was forced to sail to Qingdao in Shandong Province shows that the Japanese side was making excuses and could not justify their actions. Therefore, the British Consulate General, in order to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of British residents in China, has decided to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese side to prevent similar unfortunate incidents from happening again in the future.

Details of the Detention as Reported in Western Newspapers

The North-China Daily News reported that the British vessel Yongzhen was detained by the Japanese authorities south of Haizhou last Saturday (the 28th) on false charges of smuggling arms and ammunition. It was then rescued by the British warship Birmingham, which sailed from Weihaiwei to Qingdao. After being released, it sailed south and arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st) morning. According to Captain Mallet of the Yongzhen, the Yongzhen departed from Shanghai on January 21 and arrived at the Hejinggang (transliteration) River, 30 miles upstream of Shaoyang River (transliteration) on the 23rd. Unloading began the next day. On the 24th and 25th, two Japanese planes flew low and circled over the vessel. On the 26th, more Japanese planes flew over the port and bombed two sailboats 500 yards from the Yongzhen, as well as a warehouse, killing 20 people. Captain Mallet received information that the water gate five miles upstream was about to be closed, so he decided to sail away from the port and return to Shanghai. Before 7:00 a.m. on January 28, the Yongzhen was stopped by a Customs patrol boat nine miles out of the river and ordered to sail to Qingdao. Captain Mallet refused. At 7:00 a.m., people from the patrol boat boarded the Yongzhen and again ordered it to sail to Qingdao. Captain Mallet still refused. At 9:00 a.m., two Japanese destroyers sent people to board the Yongzhen and said that if they did not comply, they would use force. Captain Mallet was forced to order the vessel to sail to Qingdao. Two other Norwegian vessels were also unloading cargo at Hejinggang and were escorted to Qingdao by the Customs patrol boat along with the Yongzhen. They arrived in Qingdao at 7:00 a.m. on the 29th. Twenty minutes later, the British warship Birmingham sailed into Qingdao. The British Consul General in Qingdao immediately began negotiations with the Japanese authorities. However, before the negotiations were completed, at 8:00 a.m. the next morning, the Birmingham's captain ordered the Yongzhen to sail out of Qingdao with them and escorted it to a certain location before the Birmingham sailed back to Weihaiwei. Captain Mallet later learned that the Norwegian vessels had sent out a wireless message, and the Birmingham had rushed to Qingdao to rescue them after receiving the message. The Yongzhen originally had a Czech wireless operator, but unfortunately he did not make it on board when the Yongzhen departed from Shanghai. Captain Mallet believed that he must have been detained in Hongkou while on his way to the ship, so there was no one on board who could send a wireless message. When the Customs patrol boat officers boarded the Yongzhen, they said that the vessel was suspected of carrying arms and ammunition, and then searched it, but only found pork. When they arrived in Qingdao, the Japanese authorities demanded to check the vessel's license and logbook, but this was refused. After the Birmingham arrived in Qingdao, the Customs authorities admitted to using force to detain the Yongzhen, which was surprising. After Captain Mallet returned to Shanghai, he reported the whole incident to the shipping company and the British Consulate. Regarding the Japanese side's accusation that the Yongzhen was smuggling arms and ammunition to guerrillas, British naval and consular officials in Shanghai investigated the matter yesterday at the consulate and found no evidence. No official statement has been released. A Japanese spokesman stated at a press conference yesterday that they had received information from the Customs that the Yongzhen was not sailing to the destination specified in its vessel license, thus violating Customs regulations, and said that the claim that Japanese destroyers detained the three vessels was not accurate. The Japanese Navy did not directly participate in the matter. The Japanese destroyers were only conducting routine patrols and sailed to Qingdao. When a reporter asked if this meant that the Japanese Navy was indirectly assisting the Customs patrol boat, which would hinder foreign vessels from sailing in the future, the spokesman consulted for a moment before replying, "No," and said that the detention of the Yongda on December 31 by the Japanese Navy was considered closed and the vessel was allowed to sail as usual.

Hafia Arrives in Shanghai, Haida to Follow

After negotiations, the Norwegian vessels Haida and Hafia were released. The Hafia left Qingdao at 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at around 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The ship docked at buoys 26 and 27 on the Huangpu River. According to the owner, Mr. C. Andersen, a Norwegian, the cash and legal tender confiscated by the Japanese side have all been returned after negotiations with the Norwegian consulate, and the damage was light. The Haida left Qingdao at 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning.

Yongzhen to Sail to Tianjin, Kailin to Test the Waters

It has also been learned that there are still four Japanese warships stationed outside the Yanghekou River mouth on the Funing Line. In order to prevent the Japanese warships from harassing them, the Chinese guerrillas have removed the navigation marks, so shipping has lost its target. It is questionable whether the area can continue to be sailed. Therefore, the British Yongzhen has decided to change course to Tianjin in the coming days. It is heard that the Hafia and Kailin are still planning to test sail to Funing to load local goods, but the exact date has not yet been determined.

### Two Puppet Regimes in Beijing and Shanghai Compete for Tax Revenue

According to foreign sources, the Nanjing "Reformed Government" learned that Shanghai's tax revenue was excellent and wanted to get involved. It sent people from its "Ministry of Finance" to Shanghai under the guise of investigating miscellaneous taxes and levies to thoroughly assess Shanghai's tax revenue. The "Shanghai Municipal Government," however, felt increasingly resentful, as all consumption taxes (likin) had already been abolished by a "decree" from the "Reformed" authorities as of February 1, and now they were coveting other tax revenues.

### Telephone Line on Hongqiao Road Cut, Communication Disrupted, Over 200 Feet of Line Lost, Japanese Troops Search Without a Trace

The North-China Daily News reported that the telephone line at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Route Robegan was stolen yesterday (the 1st) morning, disrupting telephone services for 20 telephone subscribers in the Hongqiao district. This is the sixth time telephone wires have been stolen on Hongqiao Road since last May. The Shanghai Telephone Company's emergency team received the alert shortly after midnight on the same day and immediately went to the barrier at the railway crossing in the area with the police department's constables. A Japanese soldier was dispatched by the Japanese authorities to escort them to the scene of the theft for investigation. They found that 240 feet of cable containing 101 pairs of telephone lines had been stolen and that some cables had been cut, apparently to be stolen. Soon after, more Japanese soldiers arrived to guard the area, hiding on the side of the road in the hope that the thieves would return to the scene to carry away the cut cables that had not yet been taken. However, no thieves returned until dawn. They then searched Chinese houses in the area at dawn, but there was no trace of the stolen cables. According to a statement issued by the telephone company yesterday, the interrupted telephone service in the area is expected to be restored tonight.

### Pudong Guerrillas Disrupt Water and Electricity Supply, Japanese-Occupied Area Plunged into Darkness, Water Pipes Still Unrepaired

Another disturbance occurred in the Japanese-occupied area along the Pudong Riverfront at 7:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, with all the lights going out completely and plunging the area into darkness. Japanese troops and puppet police were dispatched to the main roads to announce a curfew. The Dongchang Road ferry across the river was closed early, and all stores closed their doors, leaving no one on the streets, creating a dead zone. At the same time, the water supply was also cut off, and all the tea houses had no water to sell, forcing residents to go to bed early, as if war was imminent. The Japanese and their puppets were disturbed all night, but nothing happened. The situation eased slightly after dawn yesterday morning, and order was restored on the streets, but the water supply was still cut off, and the water source was cut off all day. The tea houses could not resume business, and residents had to find ways to fetch water from the Pudong River and river floods for drinking. It is understood that the disruption of water and electricity was caused by the guerrillas. The broken power line was on Pudong Avenue. Yesterday, the power plant identified the damaged area and dispatched workers to repair it. However, the location of the broken water pipe has not yet been found, so it is still questionable whether the water supply can be restored this morning. This shows that the Pudong guerrillas are becoming more active.

### Confiscated Rickshaws Still Not Released, Two Chinese Directors Plead for Rickshaw Pullers, Authorities Still Need to Consider Carefully

The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association, in order to request that the Public Works Department stop shortening rickshaw shafts and extend the deadline for modifying rickshaw wheels, sent representatives to petition five Chinese directors. The directors expressed sympathy and promised to mediate. They first negotiated with the Public Works Department to release the confiscated rickshaws. The association's representatives had originally planned to petition various public organizations again yesterday to ask for assistance, but they were advised by Chinese directors Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu, etc., that the association's members were emotionally charged and feared that there would be accidents along the way, so they temporarily cancelled the plan. The Chinese directors are concerned about this case and appointed Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu as representatives. They visited the heads of the Public Works Department and the Police Department of the Public Works Department yesterday to ask them to order the police stations to release the confiscated vehicles first to maintain the livelihoods of the coolies. The Public Works Department stated that the Mutual Aid Association's request to waive the inspection fee required careful consideration, so it is unclear whether the vehicles confiscated by the police stations would be released. It will be known today or tomorrow.

### The Money Industry Association Resolved Yesterday on Various Matters Before and After the Year-End Settlement, Stipulated Interest Rates, Time for Collecting Bills, etc., Interbank Lending Rate to Open Until the 17th

The Shanghai Money Industry Association held its 40th regular meeting of member representatives of the third session at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the association on Ningbo Road. Representatives from 43 companies, including Fuyuan, Wufeng, Shunkang, Tongrun, Zhentai, Hefei, Yida, and Cunde, attended, including Zhang Mengzhou, Zhang Wenbo, Pei Yunqing, Shen Jingbiao, Lu Shuchen, Yan Dayou, Zhao Songyuan, and Xi Jiming, totaling over 60 people. Lu Shuchen chaired the meeting, and Secretary Ge Huaiqing recorded the proceedings. The reports included: Minutes of the previous meeting, incoming and outgoing documents for January, totaling 548 items, and two joint meetings of the industry held at the association in January. Various reports on the preparation of reserves. The discussion items included: Please discuss and decide on the handling of business before and after the 27th year-end settlement. The 27th year-end settlement date was decided as February 18 (i.e., Lunar New Year's Eve). Regarding the interest issue before the year-end settlement, it was decided that interest would be paid at 3% until February 13, and overdue interest would be added after February 13. The time for collecting bills was decided as 4:00 p.m. on February 18 for interbank collection of bills in the market. After that time, each company should collect from each other, limited to 6:00 p.m. It was decided that the interbank lending rate in the market would be open until February 17, and the meeting would adjourn at 4:00 p.m.

Four Remittance Banks Reorganized

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the banking industry that the money industry decided that after the 27th year-end settlement on January 18, there would be four days of vacation on February 19, 20, 21, and 22 to organize everything. Business would resume on the 23rd. Banks will have a four-day spring vacation during the year-end settlement period, but in the days before the year-end settlement, they will extend their office hours to handle internal settlements and remittance matters. As for the 43 remittance banks, four of them have reported to the association and have been approved for reorganization during this year-end settlement period, which involves changing the names of shareholders and managers. It is expected that all 43 of these companies will eventually be listed, but no one has yet announced an increase in capital.

Financial Market Remains Stable

Although the financial market on the isolated island is in a time of war, it remains stable due to the government's appropriate handling, the efforts of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank to regulate, and the handling of interbank mortgage lending. This is very different from the year before. Various interest rates have rarely changed. The daily lending rate for money shops is between 1.1% and 1.3%. The discount rate for the Discount Committee is 7.5%, and the lending rate is 2.5%. The interbank lending rate for bank reserves is 2.5% in national currency and 2.2% for remittances. The discount rate is 2.5% in national currency and 2.0% for remittances. The above three have remained unchanged throughout.

Various Industries Preparing to Pass the Year-End

The year-end settlement period for various industries is usually based on the money industry. Now that the year-end settlement period is approaching, various factories, businesses, and companies in the city have been preparing separately. For loans made, invoices have been distributed for local loans, and personnel have been sent to collect foreign loans. At the same time, responsible managers are mobilizing funds to repay outstanding debts to money shops as much as possible or using goods to mortgage to banks and shops. However, due to the war, businesses operating domestic goods within the Shanghai concessions have experienced abnormal development, and the goods produced have earned high profits. Therefore, there is no problem for various industries to safely pass the year-end settlement period.

### Japanese Puppets Control Export Goods from Yantai, British Vessels Suffer Restrictions, Two Vessels Fail to Load Goods When Leaving Yantai, Japanese Attempt to Obtain Foreign Exchange Overseas

The Continental News reported that Yantai is one of China's main seaports. After allowing Western merchants in the area a two-week grace period, the Japanese began prohibiting foreign trade and shipping yesterday (the 1st) unless bills of exchange were issued by the quasi-official Yokohama Specie Bank. Otherwise, export licenses would not be issued. This new blow to foreign businesses has already had an immediate impact.

Two British Vessels

Namely Jardine Matheson's Yisheng and Taikoo's Shuntian, sailed out of Yantai yesterday. The goods originally to be carried by the two vessels could not be loaded due to the new export restrictions. A Japanese embassy spokesman told foreign reporters last night that the exchange and export regulations implemented in Yantai and Weihaiwei yesterday were the same as the regulations implemented in Qingdao by the "Provisional Government" in North China through the customs authorities. These regulations are not intended to discriminate against merchants or Chinese merchants from third countries in the above two locations. According to local merchants familiar with the situation in Qingdao last night, the Japanese are trying to raise foreign exchange reserves for the "Federal Reserve Bank." After the implementation of this restriction, the Japanese can achieve their goal through all exports from Shandong. By handling exchange transactions through the Yokohama Specie Bank, the bank can obtain foreign exchange overseas and pay exporters at the exchange rate set in Japan, which is one shilling and two pence or 29 US cents per "Federal Reserve" yuan. According to a financial expert who recently visited Qingdao, this false exchange value has bound and harmed the once thriving export trade in the port. According to another merchant who recently came to Shanghai from North China, foreign businesses in the area are almost unable to operate due to the exchange regulations. A reporter asked a Japanese embassy spokesman last night whether these regulations were first notified to the Shanghai Jianghai Customs Commissioner and approved by him, or whether the Chinese Customs had been divided into two separate systems. The spokesman replied that it was still one system, but the customs authorities were acting on facts and not on theory. The various customs authorities have

Accomodated to the situation. The spokesman also replied that there must be some indirect contact between the Jianghai Customs Commissioner and the "Provisional Government" "Ministry of Finance" on the question of whether there was any contact. According to this restriction, which is now being implemented in Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Yantai, the restriction has not yet been extended to Tianjin, a major shipping center in North China, at least for the time being.

The North-China Daily News reported that at a recent press conference hosted by the Japanese side, a reporter asked the Japanese embassy spokesman about the issue of export licenses in Yantai. The spokesman, after investigating the matter, stated at a press conference yesterday (the 1st) that since January 15, the "Provisional Government" in Peiping had promulgated regulations on export licenses and exchange in Yantai and Weihaiwei, which were the same as those implemented in Qingdao. It was believed that the "Provisional Government" felt it was necessary to

Expand these regulations to the above two seaports in order to stabilize the paper money of the "Federal Reserve Bank." A reporter asked who promulgated these regulations and who implemented them. The spokesman replied that the "instructions" were issued by the "Ministry of Finance" in Peiping and handed over to the customs authorities for implementation. The reporter asked, since the customs in the two locations are managed by the Shanghai

Customs Commissioner, how could that "ministry" issue these "instructions?" The spokesman replied that this "order" may have been issued from Shanghai. When asked if there was any contact between the customs personnel, the spokesman replied that they had ways of making indirect contact.

### 1,000 Wounded Japanese Soldiers Return Home by Ship, Moaning in Agony, Screaming Desperately

At 7:00 a.m. yesterday, the Japanese Red Cross ship Chikasa Maru, which was docked at the Japanese Osaka Wharf in Hongkou, set sail with over 1,000 wounded Japanese soldiers on board to be transported back to Japan for treatment. These Japanese soldiers were all seriously injured and could not be treated in Shanghai.

### No Japanese Warships Outside Zhenhai Port, Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai Can Rest Assured

Although Japanese warships had been spying outside Zhenhai Port and had once fired on Chuanshan, they were all random shots and caused no damage. According to reports from Ningbo to Shanghai, although the whereabouts of the Japanese warships off the coast are erratic, there are no spies off the coast of various ports in eastern Zhejiang. The coastal garrisons are also on strict alert. The military discipline inspection team recently visited Zhejiang to inspect and expressed satisfaction with the coastal defense. Fellow townsmen in Shanghai can rest assured.

### Citizens Group Solicitation Committee Sets Regular Deadlines; Second Performance Review; The Committee Notifies Team Leaders Yesterday to Intensify Solicitation to Benefit Refugees

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens Group Solicitation Committee yesterday notified the leaders of each solicitation team that the second performance review will be held on February 10th, urging them to continue their efforts to benefit refugees. Team leaders who have not yet received their badges or need to obtain more sponsorship certificates are asked to come to the association to collect them immediately.

Formulating Slogans: To arouse all citizens to participate in the refugee sponsorship movement, the group has specially formulated various colorful slogans, such as "A monthly donation of two yuan in national currency can save a refugee's life" and "It is a pleasure to do good deeds," all of which are extremely eye-catching. Starting yesterday, staff were sent to major hotels, restaurants, and public entertainment venues to post them, in order to widely promote the message.

Recruiting Staff: The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, located at 93 Guangdong Road in this city, now requires one male staff member who is capable of statistics and field investigation work, and who has his own bicycle and is familiar with the routes as qualifications. The monthly salary is thirty yuan, and the association will provide lunch. All high school graduates can bring their resumes and certificates to the association's rehabilitation office to register from now until the 6th, from 2 pm to 4 pm every day, and then take the examination on schedule.

Employing Refugees: The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been entrusted by enthusiastic people to employ refugees for the third time. Refugees from various reception centers who feel they meet the requirements can be recommended by the director of the reception center to contact the association's rehabilitation office at 93 Guangdong Road. The openings include: three female workers for yarn spinning, three apprentices for printing shops, four workers, ten salespeople, fifteen maids, one maid who can make Ningbo dumplings, one apprentice for washing and dyeing, five apprentices for wood carving, seven female workers for shoe factories, four apprentices for sock factories, ten female workers, six female workers for industrial cooperatives, three elder sisters, ten punching press workers, one salesperson for school books, two female trainees for wireless radio, two ordinary male workers, and one female worker aged thirteen or fourteen.

### Ningbo Native Association Concerned About Goods Stranded in Ningbo; Stockpiles Exceed 20 Million; Plans to Request Approval from Two Ministries to Clear

Since the Zhejiang Customs was ordered to prohibit the export of 55 kinds of local products, such as cotton, cotton yarn, and tung oil, the value of goods stockpiled in Ningbo has exceeded 20 million. Although Governor Huang of Zhejiang Province approved the export, citing that Shanghai is a non-violent control area, the Zhejiang Customs still does not allow exports because it has not received orders from the Ministry of Finance. The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce is continuing to telegraph Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance and Minister Weng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter yesterday, the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai also believes that at this time of great conclusion, the stagnation of goods in Ningbo and the inability to sell them abroad will greatly affect local finance and the distress of farmers and merchants. They will also hold a meeting in the next few days to request the two ministries of finance and economy to allow the clearance of goods stranded in Ningbo, in order to alleviate the suffering of farmers and merchants and circulate the local economy.

### Overseas Chinese Remittances to China Last Year Exceeded 600 Million Yuan; Donations to the Government Exceeded 100 Million Yuan; Stability of Wartime Finance Relies on This

Overseas Chinese contributions to the motherland are substantial. The amount remitted in the entire year of the 27th year of the Republic exceeded 600 million yuan. The stable situation of our country's wartime finances today is partly due to this. The details are recorded as follows:

According to a recent announcement from Hong Kong, foreign exchange transactions in Hong Kong were quite busy last year, a large part of which was due to remittances from overseas Chinese. Statistics show that the amount remitted by overseas Chinese in the 27th year of the Republic exceeded 600 million yuan, of which direct donations to the government reached 120 million yuan. This number is more than double the amount remitted during the most prosperous period of foreign economy. Its contribution to foreign exchange is self-evident. It is heard that more than half of the 120 million yuan of donations came from Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines. Other overseas Chinese decided to donate a total of 1.7 million, 1.3 million, and 110,000 people. In addition, the Western Hemisphere donated more than 27 million yuan to war expenses this year, including 15 million yuan from the United States, 3 million yuan from Canada, and 9 million yuan from Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and South America.

Overseas Chinese remittances have always been busiest before the Lunar New Year, because the end of the year and the beginning of the year are times of great need. As the Lunar New Year is approaching, in order to allow recipients to spend the New Year, overseas Chinese remittances at this time will definitely be better than usual. These remittances can arrive within ten days, so it is expected that these remittances will increase this week. At the same time, foreign exchange transactions between Hong Kong and Shanghai will also become more frequent, because overseas Chinese remittances are centered in Hong Kong.

### Ningbo Defense Department Orders All Ships to Register; Failure to Do So by Deadline Will Result in Cancellation of Navigation Rights; Meta and Tangsai to Join Direct Shipping Soon

After the military authorities of Zhejiang Province approved the direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo in order to relieve freight transportation, all ships joined the shipping one after another. The Ningbo Defense Command specially ordered a deadline for supplementary registration, otherwise the navigation rights will be cancelled. The Ningbo-Taiwan ships Meta and Tangsai also sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai to join the direct shipping. The Xinanna and Moufu ships are scheduled to sail to Ningbo for the second time today. The details are recorded as follows:

Ningbo Defense Department Sets Registration Deadline: The Ningbo Defense Command stipulates in Article 2 of the Zhejiang East Shipping Regulations that the approved ships must provide a guarantee of more than one year of operation and be inspected by the Ningbo-Wenzhou Shipping Administration Office before they can be allowed to navigate. It has ordered all shipping companies to comply. Before these procedures are completed, in order to ease the difficulties of merchants and facilitate the transportation of local goods during the Lunar New Year, it has specially submitted a request to the Group Army Headquarters to temporarily allow merchant ships hired by merchants to navigate. Now it has received a reply from the headquarters approving it, but ordering them to complete the registration procedures as soon as possible. The Defense Department has now agreed with the Ningbo Shipping Administration Office to set a deadline for completion. In the future, if the new registration procedures are not completed after the deadline, even if merchants hire them, they will not be allowed to sail to Ningbo, and their previous registration will be cancelled.

Meta and Tangsai Join Direct Shipping: The Meta ship of the Portuguese company Meili and the Tangsai ship of the American company Huamei have always sailed on the Ningbo-Taiwan line. They were ordered to stop sailing to Shanghai, so the two ships did not sail on the Ningbo-Taiwan line. It is now learned that the two ships sailed directly from Ningbo to Shanghai yesterday. It is heard that they will also join the direct shipping to transport local products. In addition, the German ship Hana, which sails on the Shanghai-Taiwan line, has also recently had news of joining the shipping to Ningbo, but it is not yet fully determined.

Xinanna and Moufu Sail to Ningbo for the Second Time: After the direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo was approved, the Moufu ship of Lihua Foreign Firm, the Xinanna ship of Weilihan Company, and the Liangzhou ship of Taikoo Foreign Firm have all been sailing to Ningbo. The Moufu and Xinanna ships returned to Shanghai one after another yesterday morning. After unloading the goods, they are scheduled to sail directly to Ningbo for the second time today or tomorrow.

### Children's Welfare Association Plans to Establish a Beggar Children's Training Institute

The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association believes that children are the lifeline of the country and the future masters of society. Since the outbreak of the war, the number of refugees in this city has increased sharply. In order to cultivate children, the association is actively carrying out its work. In addition to the more than ten newspaper boy schools that have been established, which have achieved remarkable results and have been deeply appreciated by Chinese and foreign people, as recorded in this newspaper, it has recently learned that it is particularly pitiful for ordinary beggar children to wander the streets, and innocent children are easily tempted by bad environments. Therefore, the chairman of the association, Chen Heqin, Chen Jicheng, and others decided to set up a beggar children's training institute to accommodate them and teach them considerable intelligence so that they can become good people in the future society. In order to raise funds, the association specially convened a board meeting yesterday and decided to hold a recreational event immediately, and invite the entertainment industry to support and participate in the performance, and all the income from the tickets will be used for the expenses of the beggar children's training institute. The organization of the recreational event was also established yesterday.

### Chinese Medical Association's Work in the Health Experiment Zone Achieves Remarkable Results Since Its Implementation

Since the Shanghai War, the population of the Special District has increased sharply, and health problems need to be paid attention to urgently. The Public Health Committee of the Chinese Medical Association, in view of this, specially designated an area west of Chengdu Road, north of Avenyue Road, east of Carter Road, and south of Suzhou River as a health experiment zone last year (including Datong Road, Chihong Road, Shanhai Pass Road, and Xinzha Road) to try out various health work and set up an office and clinic at 25 Chi Ham Road. Since its opening, with the assistance of the Health Department of the Engineering Bureau, various health works in the area have been carried out resolutely and smoothly. The starting method is to send public health nurses to visit homes in the area, instill health knowledge, and improve living habits. If there are patients, those with minor illnesses are guided to go to the office for medical treatment, and those with serious illnesses are sent doctors to their homes for diagnosis and treatment, or transferred to hospitals for treatment. Pregnant women are taught knowledge of pregnancy and urged to go to the clinic for examination on schedule. When they are about to give birth, they try to introduce obstetrics hospitals to deliver babies. Newborn babies are also provided with nutritious materials such as milk powder and cod liver oil. The outpatient department of the office has dentistry, general medicine for men and women, gynecology, pediatrics, venereal disease, leprosy, vaccination, etc. Children's meetings and mother's meetings are also held there. Now, a vaccination campaign is being held, and nurses in the area call out every day to persuade and vaccinate.

### Revitalize Rural Areas to Recover Leakage; Develop Small Rural Industries; Purchase, Transportation, and Sales Are Planned by the Cooperative Association as a Whole; Centralized Implementation to Reduce Costs and Promote Sales

The National Government believes that there are a large number of rural handicraft industries and small-scale factories. These small industries, which are purely manual or semi-manual and semi-machinery, are mostly farmers engaged in the industry of various daily necessities. In the past, the number of exports overseas every year was very large. Since the Sino-Japanese War, some factories are located in the war zone, and the machinery has been destroyed. There is no way to relocate. Those outside the war zone are fortunate that the machinery has not been destroyed, but due to traffic obstruction, it is not easy to carry out large-scale transportation. Therefore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is making every effort to encourage the development of small industries, supplement farmers' lives, recover leakage, and return funds to rural areas. The China Industrial Cooperative Association is the only agency that guides the development of rural industry, and divides the country into four major regions, using social idle funds to engage in production, strive to promote the cooperative movement, and convene small industrial product exhibitions. The purchase, transportation, and sales of small industries are planned by the association as a whole, carried out centrally, reduce costs, promote sales, and avoid monopoly and exploitation by intermediate merchants. The value of small industrial products exported overseas last year and the year before is recorded as follows:

### Hongyun Ship Robbed by Bandits; Robbed at Liuhekou; About Ten Bandits

The Hongyun Company's Hongyun ship sails to Liuhe, Qi, and Chongming's Haihongzong and other places. At 6 am on the 2nd (two days ago), as usual, it loaded cargo and passengers in Shanghai and exited. It first arrived at Liuhe. At about 10 am when it arrived at Liuhekou, passengers were getting on and off, cargo was being unloaded, and a rice barge from Liuhe was alongside, preparing to load. Suddenly, a pirate ship sailed over and leaned alongside. More than ten bandits, each holding guns, swarmed onto the ship. Seeing the bad situation, the rice barge untied the rope and retreated into the port. After the bandits boarded the ship, one who looked like a bandit leader went to the passenger cabin and said, "We are here to investigate a Suzhou person. Don't praise us." Then he left. Soon, more than ten people, holding long and short guns, entered and said, "Check the good people's certificate, take it out quickly, and the leather suitcase must also be taken out." Everyone was hesitating. One person showed a leather suitcase with two yuan in banknotes. After a bandit looked at it, he returned it to the original person. Everyone saw it and thought that the banknotes were still returned, so they did not suspect it was a bandit, and took them out one by one to hand them over for inspection. Unexpectedly, all the banknotes were robbed. After searching and robbing the lower passenger cabin, they went to the upper passenger cabin and the accounting room. All the luggage and clothes and hats of the passengers were robbed. Before leaving, they also took 29 bags of sugar transported to Haihong Port from the cabin and escaped. The robbery lasted for about an hour, and the loss was 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The ship did not sail further, and returned to Shanghai at about 12 o'clock. It arrived at the port at 4:30 pm. The crew went to the company to report. The ship started exporting as usual yesterday morning.

### Yangshupu Yarn Factory Employees' January 28th Donation

All the employees of Yangshupu Yarn Factory are sincerely patriotic and enthusiastic about good deeds. They held a donation campaign on the anniversary of January 28th this year, and took out a part of the donation, totaling 64 yuan, 4 jiao, and 8 fen in national currency, which was personally sent by Ms. He Peizhen and Ms. Shuai Yuqiu from the factory's preparation department to the Tongren Refugee Hospital on Bailinan Road in this city to be used for the hospital's rescue of refugees and refugee children.

### Pudong Oil Factories Occupied; Changde and Dade Xin Factories; Property Owners Unable to Consult

The Japanese side, ignoring the property rights of Chinese businessmen in the occupied areas, has been occupying various factories that have been suspended after the war one after another. Yesterday, two oil factories in Pudong, Yangjiadu Changde and Dade Xin, which are very large in scale, were occupied by the Japanese at the same time. The two teams of soldiers of the Noike Unit of the 3rd Battalion of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in the two factories simultaneously withdrew and moved to the occupied electric light factory in Zhangjiabang. The two factories were led by a Japanese named Yoshida, with many ignorant Chinese people, to the factory to sort out the machinery. It is heard that they plan to recruit workers separately and start oil production in the near future. The original property owners of the two factories are unable to consult.

### New Pharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical Industry Association Forms Review Committee; Urges Members to Strictly Abide by Laws

The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical Industry Association believes that maintaining national health and treating diseases are different from other businesses, so the government has established strict management laws and regulations. The two associations proceed with pharmaceutical affairs based on the various management rules promulgated by the state. Since the government moved west and the competent authorities also moved west, but our industry is one of the special industries in society, and the two associations are legal groups, it is real to urge members to strictly abide by the rules for managing pharmaceutical merchants and the rules for amending the management of prepared drugs. In order to maintain the dignity of the industry and the interests of members, a member review committee was specially established. The meeting was held yesterday, and the following review rules were passed: Name: Shanghai New Pharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical Industry Association Member Review Committee; Committee: provisionally set at eleven members, which may be added when necessary, and elected by the joint meeting of the executive, supervisory, and advisory committees of the two associations; Powers: exclusively responsible for reviewing whether new members meet the requirements for admission; the results of the review shall be reported to the respective relevant associations separately; Standards: (A) refer to the pharmaceutical merchant management rules and the amended prepared drug management rules promulgated by the government for verification; (B) those who have obtained a pharmaceutical merchant license and request to join the association shall send personnel to investigate whether they are following the rules; those who have not obtained a pharmaceutical merchant license must investigate whether they are handling matters according to law; if the results of the investigation are considered qualified, they may be passed; (C) the review procedure shall be completed within two weeks; Supplementary Provisions: These rules shall be implemented after being passed by the joint meeting of the executive, supervisory, and advisory committees of the two associations, and the same shall apply to amendments.

### Lunar New Year's Eve; Concessions Still Under Curfew

The Lunar New Year's Eve is approaching in an instant. Residents of this city often cannot avoid being customary, and are particularly concerned about the curfew in the concessions on New Year's Eve. A reporter inquired from the Public Works Bureau yesterday and learned that although the concession authorities have not made a specific decision on the issue of the New Year's Eve curfew, due to the necessity of reality, it has been internally decided not to cancel the curfew or shorten the curfew time. However, in order to adapt to the habits of the majority of residents, depending on the actual needs, the curfew will not be implemented immediately at the beginning of the curfew time, but suspicious pedestrians must still be arrested, and each police station will increase patrol squads and search squads to step up patrols and searches of pedestrians.

### Time Must Be Expedited for Posting Various Parcels; Send Immediately After Customs Inspection; Avoid Temporary Congestion and Haste

The United Mailing Group of Small Parcel Mail of the Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice yesterday, saying that the office hours of the group's window are from 9 am to 5 pm, without stopping during lunch time. Now it is found that most of the parcels are often delayed until after 3 pm before they can be sent, resulting in congestion, haste, and confusion, which is inconvenient for the post office and the public. In order to reduce the above difficulties, it is hoped that after completing the customs inspection procedures as soon as possible in the future, each sender will immediately send them to the respective windows, and do not delay any longer, so as not to miss the opportunity. This is a special notice.

### å·¥é¨å±ä¸ä¹ä¸å«å¹´ä»½ãè­¦åå ±å¿ï¼äºï¼

Within the Public Concession, there are twenty-five cinemas. Within the French Concession, there are ten. The films inspected by the Police Department consisted of 463 feature films, 941 short films, and 195 newsreels, totaling 4,493,194 feet in length. 150 films were approved for screening after cuts, and 16 were not allowed to be screened. Among these, one was allowed to be screened after the Film Censorship Committee accepted a protest and re-examined it. Printed materials and advertising posters of cinemas were also inspected by the Police Department. Of all the films, American productions accounted for 80 percent, Chinese productions 11 percent, British productions 7 percent, and other countries, including Soviet Russia, France, Germany, Italy, and Czechoslovakia, together accounted for 2 percent.

The Police Department periodically reviewed 315 kinds of Chinese newspapers and magazines, both large and small, as well as publications in English, French, German, Russian, and Japanese. Noteworthy content in these publications was translated daily. Eighty-six publications and four news agencies were warned by the police for publishing or disseminating inaccurate information or other inappropriate content. Several of these, due to the severity of the circumstances, were either banned or ordered to suspend publication temporarily. A total of twenty-seven individuals were prosecuted for selling obscene books and paintings, publishing obscene content, or violating Chinese publishing laws. These defendants were sentenced to fines ranging from ten to two hundred and fifty yuan each. Various bookstores were inspected from time to time, and several improper books were confiscated. Of the foreign language publications registered with the Police Department, thirty-three kinds, and of the Chinese publications, three hundred and fourteen kinds, one hundred and twenty-one voluntarily ceased publication.

At the end of last year, the police force consisted of 487 Western personnel, 4426 Chinese personnel, 272 Japanese personnel, and 535 Indian personnel (including those in the inner ranks).

The northeast districts of the concessions have not yet been opened, therefore the traffic in the central and western districts is even more congested. The number of freight trucks has greatly increased, but the total number of licensed vehicles of all kinds has decreased compared to the previous year.

Accidents and injury incidents on the streets have increased compared to the previous year, but decreased compared to 1936. The number of deaths, however, has more than doubled compared to the previous two years.

There are fewer reports regarding violations of traffic regulations in the Police Department's records. The number of cases prosecuted according to law is the lowest in the past ten years. The reason for this is the restriction of police power in the northern district and the post-war phenomenon at the beginning of the year. The Police Department sent personnel to various elementary schools to lecture on the importance of safety when walking. The audience totaled 12,025 people. Several kinds of traffic-related picture posters were distributed to the schools to supplement the lectures. Several of these posters were selected and posted in various alleyways at the beginning of summer. Professional lecturers went to various factories, teahouses, and refugee camps to lecture on the importance of safety when walking. The audience totaled more than 110,000 people.

Warning signs for vehicles to slow down have been erected near schools with a large number of students.

A vehicle lane change system has been implemented at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road, Race Course Road, Guangdong Road, and Beihai Road. As of the end of the year, it is still under trial.

### Many Thugs Arrested Last NightãPlanning to Join the Pseudo "Self-Defense Corps"ãWhether There Was Criminal Behavior Is Still Under InvestigationãPseudo "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an Flatters the JapaneseãRecruiting Traitors to Organize Pseudo "Self-Defense Corps"

Since the onset of winter, theft cases have occurred frequently within the concessions. Therefore, the police stations have stepped up the organization of search teams and patrol teams to maintain vigilance. Yesterday, the Lao Zha Police Station dispatched Western police officer No. 128, Chinese police officers No. 1305, No. 2581, and No. 3155 to search pedestrians within the concession. At 9:10 PM, they encountered three individuals at the intersection of Hankou Road and Guangxi Road: Wu Tianbao from Zhejiang, Li Jishan from Yangzhou, and Chen Jiabao from Shanghai. Suspecting their behavior, they stopped them for a search. They found a Mauser pistol on Wu, with four bullets inside, and another ten bullets in his pocket. They found a Mauser pistol on Li, with seven bullets inside, and another three bullets in his pocket. They found a handgun on Chen, with three bullets, and the gun and bullets were already loaded. They were all taken back to the police station, as briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. Subsequently, four more accomplices were apprehended in Room 9 of the Shanghai Hotel on Hankou Road: Shen A'gen from Jiaxing, Jia Jinfu from Pudong, Wang A'rong from Hangzhou, and Huang Zhao's from Pudong. According to the results of the investigation, it was learned that the pseudo "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an, recently planned to ingratiate himself with the Japanese and ordered the organization of a so-called "Self-Defense Corps" to suppress the activities of guerrillas. However, it was stipulated that all members who surrendered must provide their own military equipment. Wu and his gang were recruited by the traitor Huang Yuming and prepared weapons to join the "Self-Defense Corps" together, hoping to have the opportunity to be promoted and make a fortune in the future. Unexpectedly, they were caught by the police station and taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that due to the urgency of time, it was impossible to investigate whether the defendants had committed theft cases within the concession. Therefore, he requested permission for temporary detention to conduct a detailed investigation. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, the court ordered them to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.

### Private Slaughter of Sick and Feeble PigsãComplex CaseãDefendant Released on BailãFurther Hearing Adjourned

Recently, unclean pork was found for sale in the market within the French Concession, which was investigated as private slaughter of sick and feeble pigs mixed for sale, greatly affecting the public's health. Furthermore, the pigs kept in the Slaughterhouse Company's Yuexing Slaughterhouse (owned by Chen Zhiqiang), Yueshun Slaughterhouse (owned by Chen Zhangquan), and Quangen Slaughterhouse (owned by Sheng Quangen) were frequently missing. Therefore, the health authorities and the Slaughterhouse Company reported to the French Police Station, requesting a secret investigation. After investigation, it was found that Liu Peilin (30 years old) from Jiangyin, who was in charge of the pigs in the Slaughterhouse Company, colluded with butchers to secretly transport the pigs out for secret slaughter and mixed sale. The facility was located at No. 75 Dingxiang Lane, Aolihe Road. The police rushed to search and found a large vat of pork, and the principal offender, Liu Peilin, was arrested for investigation. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. The French Police Department has concluded its investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Liu Peilin was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Miao Qingbang questioned him. The lawyer Fei Xizhen, representing the administrative authorities of the French Concession, stated the case and prosecuted him for professional embezzlement under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The plaintiffs Chen Zhiqiang, Chen Zhangquan, and Sheng Quangen jointly retained lawyer Wang Shizong to file an incidental civil suit, demanding compensation for damages. The defendant retained lawyer Cai Xiaobai for defense. The plaintiffs stated that the pigs entrusted to the defendant for management were frequently missing, resulting in considerable losses, and requested strict investigation according to the law. When questioned, the defendant admitted to the embezzlement, stating that he was hired by the Meat Industry Association and the Slaughterhouse Association, and compensated for the missing pigs according to the amount. Furthermore, live pigs easily wandered around in the shed, which could easily lead to mistakes. The court found the case complex and ordered a further hearing on the 11th. The defendant was released on bail.

### Robbers Quarreling Over Stolen GoodsãOne Person ArrestedãRickshaw Driver Colluding to Commit RobberyãCourt Orders Adjourned Hearing

Li Jizhang, 39 years old from Ningbo, the manager of Fuxing Lumber Mill at No. 974 Avenue Edward VII, carried a large bundle of cash, totaling 3,200 yuan, at 11:00 AM one day, intending to go to the Xinhua Bank on Avenue Joffre for deposit. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw passed the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Say Zo SÃ©, five robbers suddenly rushed out from the roadside and stopped Li's rickshaw, pretending to search and robbing all the cash before fleeing north. Seeing that the robbers were not carrying weapons, Li got out of the rickshaw and desperately chased after them, shouting loudly for thieves. One of the robbers, fleeing to the entrance of Gaosheng Lane on Danshui Road, scattered the banknotes on the road while fleeing towards the British Concession. The victim recovered 1,850 yuan and reported to the French Police Station, requesting an arrest. The robbers fled to the Gonghe Teahouse on Connaught Road to divide the loot, and quarreled due to the discrepancy in the amount. The Gordon Road Police Station learned of this and rushed to arrest the robber Zhang Haichang (29 years old, former rickshaw driver) from Nantong. The stolen money had been taken away by the remaining robbers. They then notified the French Police Station to dispatch detectives Geng Quanchang and Wu Wengang to bring Zhang back to the French Police Station. According to the confession, Sun Wugen (29 years old from Nantong), the rickshaw driver of the victim's family, colluded to commit the robbery along with the fugitives Zhu A'jin and Cai Mapi. Sun was subsequently arrested. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Second Special Court, requesting detention for investigation. Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated them in the First Criminal Court and ordered a further hearing on the 7th. The defendants were taken into custody.

### College Student Establishes Personnel AgencyãAccused of Defrauding Guarantee DepositsãInvestigation Confirms One Year Imprisonment

Xie Xiangsheng, a graduate of a certain university, recently established a so-called personnel agency at No. 133 Yuanmingyuan Road, engaging in marriage introductions and job placements to defraud others of their property. At the same time, he also advertised for male and female employees, collecting huge guarantee deposits. The Public Concession authorities investigated after receiving a report, but could not find evidence of his fraud, so no prosecution was initiated. Xie then took advantage of this opportunity and advertised again, claiming that he had obtained the approval of the Concession authorities. As a result, more people were deceived than before. Now, the General Patrol Room has received reports from male employee Shao Zihong, She Fenghui, female employee Chen Wen, Jin Zhiying, and Cao Huizhong, stating that they were all employees recruited by Xie through advertisements and had paid a total of 514.30 yuan in guarantee deposits. After serving until now, they have not received a single penny of salary. Now Xie is avoiding them and has also returned the rental furniture to the furniture store, clearly intending to embezzle the guarantee deposits they paid. The Chinese detective Sun Minchang confirmed the facts and managed to arrest Xie the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for embezzlement and argued that Xie's business was entirely a trick to deceive others of their property. If he is not severely punished, it would be difficult to deter others. Therefore, he requested that the court impose a severe sentence according to law to punish the illegal and deter others. Subsequently, Shao Zihong and others filed a case, proving the experience of being deceived. When questioned, Xie Xiangsheng admitted to collecting guarantee deposits from the plaintiffs, but claimed that he had obtained the consent of the plaintiffs to use the money they paid to compensate the guarantee deposits paid by former employees who had resigned. However, Shao and others denied this fact. Judge Feng Shide, after verifying the confession, sentenced Xie Xiangsheng to one year imprisonment as a warning.

### Woman Colludes With ParamourãEntices Young Girl Into ProstitutionãParamour Escapes, Paramour Arrested

Wang Fumei, a 37-year-old woman from Changshu, had an affair with Zhu Jinlin from the same village. On the 15th of last month, she returned to her hometown and enticed Zhu Jinlin's uncle, Zhu Yaogen's 15-year-old daughter Yuexian, and Zhu Bingquan's 12-year-old daughter Xiuying, to come to Shanghai under the pretext of recommending them to work in a factory. After enticing them to Shanghai, they were lodged in an inn, and Yuexian was forced to receive guests and sell herself into prostitution. When the girl refused, and the girl's parents found out, they tracked them down to Shanghai. The girl was then hidden elsewhere. After reporting to the French Police Station, Wang Fumei was arrested by detectives the day before yesterday at No. 58 Ruifu Lane, Zilaihuo Street. The two girls were also found. After interrogation, it was learned that Wang colluded with her paramour, and the paramour Zhu Jinlin had fled upon hearing the news. Only Wang was taken to the police station. Yesterday, she was sent to the Second Special Court, requesting a postponed investigation. Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated her in the First Criminal Court. The two victimized girls testified about being abducted and forced into prostitution. When questioned, Wang Fumei vehemently denied it, stating that the plaintiffs did not allow her to enter their Zhu family, and they falsely accused her out of resentment. The court ordered a further hearing on the 11th. The defendant was taken into custody.

### Carpenter Carrying Wooden BoardsãSlips and Falls to Death

Wang Jintang, a 45-year-old carpenter from Yangzhou, lived on the fourth floor of No. 41 Huacheng Road, French Concession. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, Wang went to Houda Lumber Mill at No. 178 Route Lafayette to purchase 18 wooden boards, which he carried back himself. Unexpectedly, when he reached the entrance of No. 0 Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge, it was raining and the road was slippery. Wang slipped and fell, and was injured in the neck and throat by the wooden boards, causing asphyxiation and fainting. Patrolman No. 764 discovered this, hired a vehicle to take him to the Avenue Joffre Police Station, and transferred him to Guangci Hospital. He died before receiving treatment. The body was then transferred to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for a coroner's examination. The wife of the deceased, Wang Chen, was notified to the case, and a report will be filed with the Second Special Court today to send personnel for examination.

### Russian Merchant Xinzhi BankãManager Sued, Trial Suspended

Shanghai Russian merchant Xinzhi Bank, formerly managed by White Russians Vosipov (transliteration) and Bitrov (transliteration), also had a branch in Harbin. Due to financial difficulties in 1936, it declared bankruptcy. The Ministry of Finance appointed White Russian lawyer Kuoliesisnichen Kuo (transliteration) as liquidator. However, because the property of the Harbin Xinzhi branch was illegally occupied by a certain party, the liquidation procedures have not yet been completed. A Soviet woman named Huotingsikaya (transliteration), who worked as a caretaker, had successively deposited a total of 2,256.30 national currency dollars in the Harbin branch until the date of bankruptcy. During the liquidation period of the bank, she received 112.81 yuan, but the balance has not yet been received. Recently, she retained a lawyer to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Vosipov, Bitrov, and Kuoliesisnichen Kuo of colluding in fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust. Upon receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Liao, held a hearing once. The plaintiff stated that the Xinzhi Bank operated by the defendants claimed to be registered in the United States and reliable. Only after the bankruptcy was it known that the bank's capital was insufficient and not registered in the United States, which was obviously fraudulent. As for Kuoliesisnichen Kuo transferring funds from the Harbin branch to the Shanghai branch, it was obviously a breach of trust. The court did not ask too many questions, even though the plaintiff's representative's statement was inconsistent with the complaint. The defendant's lawyer stated to the court that there were procedural issues in this case. Even if the court had jurisdiction, it would only be a civil matter, and the defendants had no fraudulent acts. He requested a judgment according to law. The court ordered a postponed hearing on record. It is now learned that Judge Liao has ruled that the entire trial of this case be suspended, and the trial will proceed after the plaintiff files a suit in the Civil Court to determine the identity.

### Outside Wusong EstuaryãFirewood Boat CapsizedãThree People DrownedãFive People Rescued

Yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 PM, a firewood boat, fully loaded with firewood from Hupukou, was sailing to Shanghai. When it reached near the Sanjia Water Lighthouse outside the Wusong Estuary, it was overturned by huge waves due to strong winds. All eight crew members and the firewood fell into the river. Three of the eight people soon drowned. The remaining five clung to the overturned bottom of the boat, drifting in the river, shouting for help. At this time, the Jiangding vessel of the German Henglun Shipping Company at No. 293 Sanma Road happened to be sailing nearby and noticed them. It quickly reversed course, and two foreign yachts went to rescue them. The five people were rescued onto the yachts and taken to Shanghai for hospital treatment.

### German CoupleãInvolved in Lawsuit After DivorceãWoman Sues Husband for Endangering LifeãPresents Various Base ActsãYesterday's Summons, Adjourned for Seven Days for Retrial

German woman Su Shiluosheng Pankexiaowusi, 30 years old, resides in an apartment at No. 2004 Jing'an Temple Road. Recently, she retained lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing German Jew Huililuosheng Pank (i.e., Dr. Luo Weilian), (residing in Room Pi-3, Metexis Apartment, No. 934 Jing'an Temple Road) of endangering life, defaming reputation, and other charges. The facts of her prosecution are that the defendant married the plaintiff on December 15, 1934. Subsequently, in November 1938, due to differing opinions, they hired a certifying lawyer and voluntarily divorced, signing a divorce agreement as evidence. However, since the two separated as husband and wife, the defendant has frequently insulted the plaintiff's reputation and disseminated written, false accusations. For example, in the defendant's letter to Mr. Scott on January 11, 1939, he referred to the plaintiff as "a criminal woman who has committed the crime of forging official documents and perjury, and is full of criminal thoughts." In his letter to Dr. Fuhuade (i.e., the certifying lawyer) on January 5, 1939, he referred to the plaintiff as a prostitute, the plaintiff's mother as a madam,

Obscene and BaseãTerms and stated, "There is no appropriate word in the world to describe this woman," and the insult, which was close to obscene, included "Other women I have seen are very perfect and interesting when naked, but I have no feeling or pleasure for her." He also referred to the plaintiff as a shameless woman, a dishonorable woman, a shameless wife, stealing gifts, etc., as detailed in his letter to the plaintiff on January 11. It is the defendant's announcement in writing,

To the Utmost of InsultãIs one of the things that damages the plaintiff's reputation. The defendant has been divorced from the plaintiff for a long time, and all the formalities for each other's clothing and other items have long been completed and clear. Unexpectedly, he repeatedly made excuses to harass her in letters, even threatening in a letter on January 11 of this year, limiting her to returning diamond rings, brooches, tablecloths, and other items by 1:00 PM on Saturday. However, these items, except for the tablecloths, were handed over clearly after signing the agreement. The diamond rings, etc., should have been returned by the plaintiff to the defendant's mother, as these items belong to the defendant's mother. Now the defendant is forcing her to hand them over unreasonably, and if he finds even a small item missing, he will

Whip ImmediatelyãAnd ask God to bless your soul. In his letter to Dr. Fuhuade on January 5, he also threatened in the same way, and said that if the items could not be resolved, he would immediately ask the Shanghai Hong'en Hospital in the West of Shanghai to reserve a bed in a vacant room. Also, in his letter to the plaintiff on November 8 of last year, he specifically notified that he had taken and killed the plaintiff's dog, and pointed out that the dog was the plaintiff herself. His intention was to foreshadow that he would use assassination methods to deal with her. The above all indicate that the defendant has committed the crimes under Articles 305 and 310 of the Criminal Law.

Requesting Severe PunishmentãAnd so on. Upon receiving the complaint, the court was summoned by Judge Zhong yesterday morning. The defendant did not arrive, and lawyer Zhou Chaogang arrived in court, requesting a postponement. The plaintiff, fearing the defendant's vicious methods, arrived in court accompanied by a patrol officer. Her lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang presented the case on her behalf, presenting various evidence to the court. The court ordered a further review in seven days.

### Theft Cases Noted

Xinzha Road, No. 10 Yanghe Lane, at around 6:45 AM yesterday morning, while the maid of the house was washing utensils in the kitchen, six robbers suddenly rushed into the house, took her down to the lower floor, and were guarded by one robber with a gun. The remaining robbers, led by two robbers with guns, went straight up the chessboard, first waking up the victim and forcing him to hand over important box keys, and began searching. After more than half an hour, they all shouted and fled. After the incident, the victim checked the losses, which amounted to more than 800 yuan, and immediately submitted a detailed list of losses to the police station in charge, requesting pursuit.

No. 11, Xingzhou Hotel, No. 4, Lane 63, Zhejiang Road, was occupied by a group of traveling merchants a few days ago. Unexpectedly, at around 8:15 PM yesterday, three robbers suddenly came to the room under the pretext of visiting. One of the robbers pulled out a handgun and coerced the people in the room, prohibiting them from making noise. At that time, the travelers saw that the robbers were fierce and armed, and they were so frightened that they lost their color. As a result, the robbers did whatever they wanted and searched them. As a result, the more than 6,000 yuan of goods stored by the guests was robbed. After waiting to call for help, the robbers had already left the house and fled. They quickly reported to the police station in charge, requesting pursuit. After receiving the report, the police station immediately ordered detectives to rush to investigate and inquired about the appearance and clothing of the robbers in detail before reporting back for the record. One side searched for clues.

At the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Zhifu Road (commonly known as Stealing Chicken Bridge), at around 5:45 PM yesterday, a passerby was kidnapped by two robbers and forbidden to make noise. They searched him and robbed him of more than 120 yuan in cash before fleeing. At the same time, at the intersection of Avenue AvÃ©nue and Jiaozhou Road, a young woman was also stopped by four robbers and robbed of her leather wallet containing 34 yuan in cash. Afterwards, they all reported to the police station in charge, requesting pursuit.

At No. 71 Jingyuan Street, Guangdong Road, at 8:00 PM, three robbers suddenly broke in and robbed. One robber with a gun threatened the people in the house, ordering them not to make noise and separating them for detention. The remaining unarmed robbers then scattered to search each room. After about half an hour, they began to withdraw and fired a shot into the sky to show their gratitude before leaving. Fortunately, no one was injured. The victim reported the incident to the police station, requesting pursuit. The losses were huge.

### Group of SuicidesãWoman Dies of Untreated Illness

Addicted to Gambling and Taking PoisonãZhang Liansheng from Yancheng, 41 years old, was working as an accountant in the Meowei Zhai Food Store at No. 122 Hankou Road, Yunnan Road. Recently, Zhang heard that the gambling style in West Shanghai was very popular, and he couldn't help but feel curious. Therefore, after closing the shop every night, he sneaked into the gambling den to place bets, hoping to get lucky. But there can be no intact thing in a tiger's den. Therefore, in less than a few nights, Zhang had lost all his hard-earned savings, and even delayed the store's account of 50 yuan, which he could not repay. With the end of the month approaching, it was impossible to make up for it. In a moment of desperation, fearing that he would be ashamed to face others, he swallowed poison to commit suicide yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM. The incident was discovered by the shop partners, who sent him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment by car. However, the poisoning was too deep, and the situation was very critical.

Youth Jumps Into RiverãThe Public Concession Nanjing Road Bund Puhua, at 9:40 AM yesterday, a young man was at the location, when no one was prepared. He suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, nearby sampan men tried their best to rescue him and prevented him from drowning. The post police arrived and questioned him, learning that his name was Jin Yirong, 28 years old, and he was tired of the world due to economic pressure. The police then called for an ambulance to take Jin to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

Angry at PoisoningãLocal man Huang Jinshi, 36 years old, lives at No. 11 Fengyu Lane, Route Say Zo SÃ©, French Concession. At 12:45 PM yesterday afternoon, in Room 114 of the Zhenhua Hotel on Fuzhou Road, Public Concession, he swallowed medicine to commit suicide behind his back. After the tea servant found out, he urgently called an ambulance and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. He died of poisoning. The reason for the suicide was that the couple quarreled and he was angry.

### Renji Hospital Medical Report

The following is the report for December of last year from Renji Hospital in this city: Outpatient visits numbered 10,929; inpatient admissions were 493; inpatient days totaled 8,455; male suicides numbered 35; female suicides numbered 46; surgical operations on inpatients numbered 160; surgical operations on outpatients numbered 372; factory accidents resulting in injuries totaled 24; patients sent by the Public Concession Police numbered 512; patients sent by the French Concession Police numbered 38; prescriptions filled numbered 15,422; X-ray examinations numbered 656. Observing the above figures, it can be seen that the overall work of this hospital has slightly decreased compared to before. However, there are some parts of the hospital where the workload has increased compared to last month. Recently, the hospital has also established a special outpatient clinic, which is separate and independent from the general outpatient department and the pediatric outpatient department. This clinic is quite popular, and those who find the general outpatient department crowded and the wait long are willing to pay a slightly higher consultation fee to be seen in this special clinic. The consultation hours for this special outpatient clinic are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily, except on Sundays.

### Sailing Ship "Adventure" Sets Sail, Intending to Circumnavigate the Globe, Crew of Ten Includes Two Women, Expected to Return to Shanghai in One and a Half Years

The English-language "North China Daily News" reports: Yesterday morning (the 1st), eight foreign men and two women sailed the yacht "Adventure" out of the Huangpu River, embarking on a circumnavigation of the globe. The "Adventure" had previously departed from Shanghai on December 13th of last year but was forced to return to Shanghai after encountering pirates who shot and punctured the drinking water tank. This time, the eight men are not all the same as the eight who originally set out, but the two women remain the same. The captain is Yugoslavian, named Rakic. The other crew members and the two women are all Russian. The "Adventure" is scheduled to first sail to Manila, then via Java and New Zealand to San Francisco, then cross the Panama Canal and traverse the Atlantic Ocean to reach Europe. On the return trip eastward, it will pass through the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal, and follow the usual route back to Shanghai. It is expected that this trip will take one and a half years to complete.

National Medicine and Food Therapy

### Stomach Disease Maintenance Methods

â He Shixi

In addition to drug treatment for stomach diseases, efforts should be made to reform the habits that cause the disease. The way to reform is maintenance and food therapy.

The way to maintain stomach diseases can be divided into "personnel" and "dietary."

Personnel: (1) Do not be overly angry, do not worry excessively, do not be depressed and unhappy. (2) Each meal should be at a fixed time. Occasionally, if the time is missed, do not overeat after being overly hungry. (3) The chest and abdomen should be stretched and not compressed. (4) Bowel movements must be smooth every day. (5) The chest and back areas must be kept warm and not exposed to cold. (6) When consulting a doctor for other illnesses, you should inform them of a history of stomach disease, so as to avoid taking other medications that may cause this disease.

Dietary: (1) Balance hunger and satiety. (2) Do not mix oily and cold foods. It is best to eat light and bland meals. (3) Eat less of indigestible foods, such as dry and hard foods, noodles, glutinous rice, raw and cold foods, etc. (4) Chew carefully when eating. (5) Avoid being exposed to wind or heat after eating. (6) You should relax slightly after eating, and do not immediately sit at a desk to work. (7) Avoid sleeping, walking quickly, or engaging in sexual activity immediately after eating. (8) Do not take yang-boosting medicines of metals and stones, or medicines that promote bowel movements. (9) Foods with excessive five flavors - sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, salty - should not be eaten in large quantities unless specifically permitted by a doctor. (10) Do not take miscellaneous medicines without a doctor's diagnosis.

### Choice of Drug Supplementation and Food Supplementation

â Xu Xiangren

When a person's body is strong and healthy, able to eat and work, plain vegetables and rice are enough to nourish life and have more than enough. There is no need to use supplements. However, due to accumulated labor leading to deficiency, prolonged illness leading to deficiency, failure to cherish and maintain oneself leading to deficiency, and women having multiple or difficult births leading to deficiency, a strong body inevitably changes to become weak. In a state of weakness, one may be able to eat but not work, or be unable to work and unable to eat. This is what is meant by deficiency. It is impossible to achieve results without supplementation. Generally speaking, those who can eat have strong stomach qi and only need food supplementation. Those who cannot eat have weak stomach qi and must use drug supplementation. Food supplementation is more peaceful but less powerful, while drug supplementation is more powerful but less peaceful. It is often said that drug supplementation is not as good as food supplementation. Drug supplementation takes effect quickly but has more side effects, while food supplementation takes effect slowly but has fewer side effects. However, the main focus of supplements is to protect our spleen and stomach. The taste is mild and balanced, and the properties are pure, with light and powerful ingredients rather than heavy food supplements. Therefore, there are cases where one cannot eat when deficient, but after taking supplements, appetite increases and physical strength gradually recovers. All of this is due to the effect of light and powerful ingredients supplementing the spleen and stomach. If the taste of a medicine is poor, it will easily damage the stomach and is not included in the category of supplements. Those that are yin-nourishing and greasy are no different from rich foods. Although the supplemental power is strong, it is still detrimental to the spleen and stomach. Porridge and rice can nourish people, and foods with blood and meat have great supplemental power. If the stomach can tolerate and digest it, the benefits are ten times that of medicines. But if it cannot be tolerated and is forced down, how is it different from bitter medicines? Therefore, others use supplements with a one-sided belief, while I only take and reject based on what is suitable for my spleen and stomach. If the stomach does not tolerate heavy foods, then supplement with medicines. If the stomach does not tolerate bitter medicines, then supplement with food. The ancient sages said that the stomach loves supplements, and what can be digested can grow. This is the standard for using supplements.

### The Relationship Between Hemorrhoids and Diet

â Lin Moyuan

The causes of hemorrhoids are mostly due to not avoiding foods, liking spicy and fried foods, and alcohol. Digestion is difficult, so bowel movements are often constipated. The anus is extremely stimulated, and the veins are subjected to pressure for a long time. Blood stasis accumulates, and tumors are formed into hemorrhoids. In addition, people in the Jiangnan area are mostly damp, and invasion becomes a leak, causing burning, itching, pain, and dripping pus and blood.

Food is the source of nutrition for human life, and selection must be cautious. No matter what kind of suffering, the cause of the disease is absolutely related to ordinary food. As the saying goes, disease enters through the mouth, which is true. As for people with hemorrhoids, they should absolutely abstain from all spicy and irritating foods. Although the condition may not be alleviated, it will not worsen. If you insist on eating spicy and irritating foods, the blood stasis in the anus will be more difficult to circulate, which will inevitably lead to inflammation and swelling, and the condition will increase sharply. Over time, rectal prolapse and bleeding will occur, or even internal invasion of poisonous flames, and the danger will be even greater. People often regard hemorrhoids as a minor disease, so they ignore the diet. Some people know it but cannot restrain themselves from the temporary desire of the mouth and abdomen, which is tantamount to hurting themselves.

### The Ability of Fruits to Treat Diseases

â He Longsheng

Fruits can help drugs to treat diseases. There are many kinds. Here are a few examples:

Grapes are rich in iron, so raisins can strengthen teeth and strengthen the stomach. Grape juice can replenish blood and strengthen the body. Pears, eaten raw, clear the heart and moisten the lungs. Pears fried with honey can treat heat cough, phlegm wheezing, clear throat, and lower blood pressure. It is the most common prescription for treating cough. Lotus root, cooked and eaten as juice, can treat cough and hemoptysis. Lotus root joints are an important medicine for ventilation. Hawthorn is an important medicine for digestion. The digestive tablets in Western medicine are made of hawthorn. Yangmei immersed in wine, the longer the year, the more effective it is in treating dysentery. When it's cold and the stove is lit, people's throats often swell and hurt from the heat. If you eat a few pieces of ebony plums, or an orange, or a few olives, every day, you can relieve the heat and stop the pain. Olive juice can relieve puffer fish poison or fishbone obstruction. In addition, lung lobes clear the lungs, and loquats moisten the lungs and resolve phlegm. They are all very effective fruits.

### Lung Disease Recuperation Items

â Zhu Zhensheng

Pulmonary tuberculosis is a chronic disease, so it is not easy to completely recover immediately during treatment. Patients often experience unlimited panic, which causes the disease to progress. In fact, if pulmonary tuberculosis can be properly conditioned and rested peacefully, it can be completely cured. Moreover, drug treatment will double the effect.

The medicines for treating pulmonary tuberculosis are mostly products for nourishing and strengthening vitality. Pulmonary tuberculosis must be cultivated with products to increase its own resistance, and then the disease can be driven out of the body. Therefore, daily food should also be rich in nourishment. In recent years, people have paid more attention to food therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis, which is true. Here are two things I have learned from experience:

Garlic can treat pulmonary tuberculosis, which is recognized by the world. The method is to use several cloves of single garlic (small garlic). Eat one raw every day. If eating raw is not to your taste, then boil and take one. Also prepare some garlic, boil several cloves in a pot every day. When boiling, bow your head and open your mouth, and inhale the steam for half an hour (but those who cannot tolerate the taste can shorten the time slightly).

White ginkgo soaked in oil is also the only nutritious product for treating pulmonary tuberculosis. However, the white ginkgo used in this prescription is not the one sold in the southern goods store, but the white ginkgo picked from the ginkgo tree (without removing the outer skin). Before the Lesser Heat, soak the picked white ginkgo (with the outer flesh) in pure vegetable oil. Only after three years can it be effective. The longer it is stored, the better. When taking it, you can chew the outer flesh together and take it with light salt water. It can nourish the lungs, resolve phlegm, kill bacteria, and relieve cough.

### Changes in Symptoms and Food Therapy Sequence for Typhoid Fever (4)

â Chen Cunren

If the fever is mild and you want to drink, you can eat "rice crust soup," also known as pot rice soup, rice skin porridge soup. When there is a fever, only eat this soup. Do not put rice grains into it. Copper pot rice crust that is scorched and black is the best, because it helps the stomach qi and is easy to digest. Rice soup contains nutritional power, but this thing is a flowing liquid, which can nourish the body without stagnating in the stomach. It is the treasure for nourishing the body in typhoid fever.

Wet warm typhoid fever can also be eaten with job's tears tea (i.e. coix seed decoction, only drink the soup), and scorched barley tea. Summer warm typhoid fever can also be drunk with lotus leaf tea. You must also administer it according to the symptoms and seek the doctor's agreement.

Drinking milk during typhoid fever is quite problematic. You must not drink it without the doctor's responsibility.

Plain boiled water is the best drink when you have a fever from typhoid fever. Often drinking it is beneficial for the consumption during fever. Recently, many patients have asked whether they can drink orange juice. Many people can drink this thing, but it must be squeezed and eaten hot. The bridge must be fat and sweet. The small one is sour, and it is not suitable.

If the fever has been lasting for a long time, if the fever is low, you are tired, and you are clear-headed, and you want to eat, you can consider drinking thin lotus root powder soup (you must use real lotus root powder before you can use it. If you use white lotus root powder, it is mostly starch, water chestnut flour, and yam flour, which are not suitable), oatmeal soup (that is, American oatmeal flakes are first fried and then cooked into a thin soup). When eating, use the word "hunger" as the principle, and you cannot seek satiety.

In the second stage of typhoid fever (see January 13 of this newspaper for symptoms), if the fever is raging, according to the doctor's instructions, you can drink snow water boiled tea, watermelon juice, bamboo juice oil, etc. When the mouth is bitter, greasy, tasteless, you can chew green salt tangerine peel, salted olives, green olives, coptis chinensis heads, etc. Change one kind a day, chew the juice, and spit out the residue. This is very important.

### Liver Foods

â Sun Zonglu

Those suffering from deficiency symptoms, eye diseases, and night blindness, eating pork liver, duck liver, chicken liver, and sheep liver often has the effect of a drumbeat, healing as they eat. Most people with night blindness suffer from malnutrition. After eating liver, they are sufficiently nourished, so they can overcome the disease. Liver creams made by Western medicine, whether taken internally or injected, come in a variety of ways, without end. They are made from animal livers and are good at treating anemia and malnutrition. Pork liver, etc., are very cheap things, and they are very rich in iron. They are readily available in the market and can be eaten as dishes. The taste is fresh and fatty, and it can replenish blood and benefit the body. Although both the poor and the rich can buy them, they are truly natural supplements. For families with children, parents should often make pork liver as a dish. After eating it for a long time, the complexion will be rosy, the spirit will be lively, and the body will be healthy.

### Winter Supplements

â Zou Demin

Winter is the end of the year, and nourishing the body and supplementing it are most needed. Most of the methods of supplementing seek medicine, so that those who are sick can be cured, and those who are not sick can strengthen their bodies. In addition, they should be supplemented with food.

Modern people regard milk as a common supplement, but when given to those who are overworked or sick, and those with weak spleen and stomach and poor appetite, there may be symptoms such as diarrhea and stagnation. This is because the digestive power of the spleen and stomach has not yet returned to normal. They are given a liquid rich in fat, which cannot be transported and received. As for lamb, it is sweet and hot. It is best for those who are older, have weak bodies, are afraid of the cold in winter, and have impotence and kidney deficiency, and those with cold aversion and stomach upset. However, it is not suitable for young and strong people. Eating too much can easily cause nosebleeds, seminal emission, and body heat. Eggs are the most nutritious food. The white can replenish qi, and the yellow can replenish blood. Boil three or four pieces in water every morning, or use boiling water and boiling milk to eat. Boiling the soup with young chickens can cultivate vitality and strengthen the body. The tonic power is great. (It is even better to use black-bone chicken.) Boiling beef juice and drinking it is also good for warming and tonifying.

The folks pass down that using a pig's trotter, combined with about a pound of longan meat, stewing it in a rice pot for several days until it is rotten, and eating it three or four times in winter is said to have great tonic power, but only those with a good stomach can eat it, because its sweet taste is not very agreeable to the stomach. The pork trotter is sweet and salty, replenishes vitality and blood. After prolonged simmering or boiling, it transforms into a sticky substance. Women who are weak and have no milk, or have thin milk, can eat it to increase milk secretion and make the milk thick. Those who have weakened qi and blood and insufficient vitality, and suffer from external symptoms such as phlegm swelling, which do not heal, can eat more to promote muscle growth and closure. Longan meat is sweet and flat, and can nourish the heart and spleen. It is effective in treating excessive thinking, damage to the heart and spleen from labor, forgetfulness, palpitation, anxiety, insomnia, spontaneous sweating, and palpitations. The ancient prescription has the combination of Guipi Decoction, which is enough to show that eating these two things together is indeed quite beneficial.

### New Theories on Nutrition

â Zhang Juying

The human body's tissues require food components called nutrients. Broadly speaking, there are five: water, salts, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Although water contains no nutritional components, it occupies the most important position. It is most abundant in blood and digestive fluids, dissolving nutrients, cleansing waste products, and regulating body temperature. Salts contain calcium, which is the main component of bone tissue. Proteins are found in meats such as pork liver and kidneys, eggs contain albumin and vitellin, and grains such as wheat contain gluten, barley contains hordein, and peas and soybeans all contain plant proteins, which are the main components of living cells and can differentiate to produce body heat and energy. Fats are found in large quantities in meats and legumes, such as butter, lard, soybean oil, peanut oil, and coconut oil, and are the body's main fuel. They generate energy when consumed within cells. Carbohydrates are the chemical names for starches and sugars. Potatoes and grains contain starch, while grapes and sugarcane contain sugar. These are all major nutritional components for the human body, providing the foundation for body heat and energy. In addition, there are three components in food called vitamins, which are suitable for the body's nourishment and maintain human health. First, vitamin A, which can dissolve in fats, is most abundant in cod liver oil, butter, and egg yolks, and also abundant in spinach and carrots. It is essential for the growth of young children, hence its name as the growth vitamin. Without it, malnutrition, developmental delays, and rickets can occur. Second, vitamin B, which can dissolve in water, is abundant in brown rice, wheat, beans, spinach, carrots, potatoes, and milk. White rice contains none. A lack of this substance in food can cause beriberi. Patients can be treated with it, hence its name as the anti-beriberi vitamin. Third, vitamin C, which can dissolve in water, is found in lettuce and oranges. It is particularly effective in preventing and treating scurvy, hence its name as the anti-scurvy vitamin. To maintain life and health, we need a certain amount of nutrients, called health food. The amount of nutrients needed varies depending on gender, age, occupation, and climate. Generally, adults need the most protein per day, followed by carbohydrates, and the least fat. Infants rely solely on human milk for growth, and must eat mixed foods after two years of age. For example, rice contains a lot of starch and little protein, while eggs are rich in protein and lack starch. No matter what kind of food, eating only one kind cannot nourish the body or maintain health. The composition of food should be properly matched so that there is no excess or deficiency of any nutrient, which is hygienic. In general, when the human body lacks a certain component, it craves that thing. Conversely, it is disgusted and does not want to eat it.

### Did Scholar Wu Really Go to Liangshan?

â Fo

According to the Tongmeng News Agency, Scholar Wu has already gone to Liangshan; however, according to other telegraphic news, Scholar Wu has not yet gone to Liangshan, so whether Scholar Wu went to Liangshan or not remains a mystery in the eyes of the world.

Scholar Wu's life and career have not had enough to make people prostrate themselves in admiration, but his integrity and unwillingness to submit to any party or person are indeed admirable. Since his defeat, he has been unwilling to take shelter under the power of outsiders, unwilling to live in the concessions, and willing to live in the old capital, reading and cultivating his ambitions. This kind of spirit is indeed extraordinary, so from this point of view, Scholar Wu will definitely not go to Liangshan.

However, Scholar Wu is now in the occupied old capital, under the power of the Japanese. How can he withstand their daily temptations, threats, coaxing, and deceptions? It is probably not easy to preserve his chastity. Moreover, the Japanese are now at their wit's end and have no choice but to do something drastic, which is not impossible. Therefore, it is also possible that Scholar Wu will go to Liangshan.

However, given Scholar Wu's current situation, there are probably only two paths he can take: one is to go to Liangshan, and the other is not to go to Liangshan, but to walk the path of the long night. If Scholar Wu goes to the path of the long night, he will become a perfect person, but if Scholar Wu really goes to Liangshan, it is not a strange or remarkable thing. Scholar Wu's strength lies in his integrity. If he goes to Liangshan, then Scholar Wu's integrity will be gone with the wind, and he will just be a walking corpse, a puppet, like Black Whirlwind Li Kui, Featherless Arrow Zhang Qing, etc., and become a member of the Liangshan gang. What does it have to do with the overall situation?

### Introduction Shops in Shanghai

â Fang Zhou

People in Shanghai can be broadly divided into two categories: those who are employed and those who employ others; however, even among those who are employed or employ others, there are differences in class and situation. It is even possible for someone to be employed by others while also employing others, or for someone who employs others to also be employed by others. Such interconnected relationships, I think, cannot be understood by a simple explanation.

The relationship between employment and being employed is constantly taking place in Shanghai, which is why special businesses such as employment agencies and introduction shops have been established. However, employment agencies that introduce legitimate professions have yet to be found; although there have been a few speculative employment agencies in the past, they were merely scams. As for those that introduce amahs, maids, and nannies, they are the so-called introduction shops. Introduction shops can be roughly divided into three groups: Suzhou, Shaoxing, and Yangzhou. They mostly operate in the northern part of the concession, such as North Zhejiang Road, Keneng Hai Road, Kaifeng Road, Haining Road, and Avenue Edward VII. There are also a few south of the Old Rubbish Bridge. In the past, we could see many introduction shops with signs like "Gusu Old Wang's Introduction Shop," "Shaoxing Old Zhang's Introduction Shop," and "Yangzhou Old [Surname]'s Introduction Shop" simply by taking a walk on those roads. And in those introduction shops, there were always many old women or women sitting and waiting to be hired by someone.

The organization of introduction shops is very simple. They do not need a lot of capital or magnificent decorations. They only need to rent a street-front shop, buy some necessary furniture, and hang up a sign for the introduction shop to be successful. However, some also prepare a mezzanine floor so that those who have just arrived in Shanghai from the countryside and have no relatives to stay with can stay for a night, but they also have to pay some rent for the night. During the day, they put a few benches in front of the door for those waiting to be hired to sit there and wait for employers.

But the owners of introduction shops must also have connections. It is not possible without connections. For example, one group is familiar with the ways of one group. Their footsteps are almost always in several mansions or large families; and each family has its own old customers. The amah, maid, or nanny who enters or leaves that mansion or that large family must be recommended by a certain introduction shop. In addition, naturally, there are also those who go to the introduction shop to call for themselves.

When the introduction shop sends the person to be hired, the employer has to pay the person who sent them some travel expenses, but there is a trial period of three days. If they are not satisfied during the trial period, they can ask the introduction shop to send another person. However, there are also mansions that notify the introduction shop in advance of what kind of person they want to hire, and then let the introduction shop find them.

I have already said in the previous article that there are originally three groups of introduction shops in Shanghai. Among these three groups, each has its own business channels. For example, employers of the Suzhou group usually go to the Suzhou group's introduction shops to find servants. At the same time, those Su-style job seekers who go to introduction shops will, of course, go to the Suzhou group's introduction shops. Therefore, they are naturally distinct from each other, but there are also exceptions, because sometimes Suzhou employers prefer to hire a Shaoxing amah, or a local employer wants to hire a Suzhou nanny, etc. But this situation is ultimately a minority, perhaps because hiring compatriots can reduce some linguistic and habitual barriers.

A woman, because she cannot live in her hometown or at home, has to come to Shanghai to find something to do. However, because she has no knowledge or specialized skills, the only way out is to help others; if she has acquaintances in Shanghai, she can ask them to find a way to introduce her. If she has no acquaintances, she has no choice but to go to an introduction shop; but introduction shops also have rules that they do not recommend without relatives, friends, or guarantors, so to be introduced, one must first have a guarantor.

After the introduction shop has properly introduced a servant and agreed on the salary, they have a regulation that 20% or 30% of the monthly salary earned by the hired person must be deducted as the introduction shop's commission, for a period of three months to six months.

Four or five years ago, introduction shops were once extremely prosperous, but now, job seekers are often introduced by relatives and friends, and employers hire directly. Therefore, the fate of introduction shops has also plummeted and is unbearable to look back on.

### A Hundred Bushels of Bright Pearls

â Bai Hua

"Rich Man, Poor Girl"

A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Production, Shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater

Every day when I open the society page of the newspaper, "news" about marriage problems accounts for a very large proportion, and these marriage disputes are mostly caused by the disparity between the rich and the poor. A "rich young master," under a momentary "whim," falls in love with a "girl from a humble family" and "marries" her; but behind this "joyful" scene, the result of a "tragedy" is already lurking. One is that the wealthy person is simply holding a "playful" attitude, relying on the magic of money to play with ordinary women as a pleasure; the other is that in this unreasonable society, people look at this "marriage" with strange eyes, relentlessly jealous and sarcastic, and finally brew a tragedy before feeling satisfied.

"A Hundred Bushels of Bright Pearls," as the original name "Rich Man, Poor Girl" indicates, the union of Bill and Joan went through so many twists and turns because of the "disparity between rich and poor." It is naturally good to make a movie with such a theme, but the playwright does not strengthen Bill's final actions to forcefully clarify and make Henry trust in the union of this "marriage." And the farce of Bill's sister Sally coming out to file a fake lawsuit weakens the power of the theme.

This play introduces a total of eight characters, in addition to Bill and Joan, there are Joan's father, mother, younger sister Helen, younger brother Frank, and Joan's cousin Henry. It can be said that the director has portrayed the personalities of these eight characters very vividly, especially Helen and Henry. Henry is "stubborn and rigid, despising money and advocating the theory of the 'great middle class' all day long"; Helen is "longing for the decadent life of wealth and ease." The director writes these two characters like this: writing Henry's dissatisfaction with Bill, such as when Bill stepped into Joan's family, he debated with Bill; Henry found a job, but knew that it was Bill who secretly recommended him, and even left the lively dance party without saying goodbye. Writing Helen is like this: Helen curls her hair and puts on powder before she knows Bill is coming; the director writes the characters of the two in opening the door to greet Bill with awkwardness, and the final cry, so powerfully.

Although the whole play is set in Joan's family, it is not dry and boring, and many scenes are lively and humorous, which must also be attributed to the director. For example, Joan explains her engagement to Bill, Bill is about to arrive, the family cleans up the tableware and dresses up; Helen's fiancÃ© suddenly breaks in during the family conversation; Bill spends the night at Joan's house, the broken sofa creaks frequently, mosquitoes and flies harass, and music is playing outside, etc. These scenes are very interesting.

Finally, Bill disappears, and the director grasps the atmosphere of the family's anxiety very firmly.

Among the small films, "A Hundred Bushels of Bright Pearls" is still a superior work.

### The Crowd Entering and Leaving Hongqiao Road

â Sifang

The long and flat Hongqiao Road, before the war, was usually lying quietly, except for the occasional car passing by, raising the dust on the side of the road and making the roar of the horn.

But now Hongqiao Road has become a bustling thoroughfare. The entrance of the barbed wire fence is like opening a giant mouth, every day, spitting out many people from the isolated island to the countryside, and every day, swallowing many people from the countryside. The crowd that is swallowed and spit out is mostly simple villagers.

Sweating profusely and panting, they carry vegetables, firewood, flowers, and other things to the isolated island to sell, providing the people on the isolated island with fresh vegetables, fuel, clean offerings for the desk, and so on.

Villagers selling firewood and rice mostly come out in the morning, sell it and go back in the afternoon, while vegetables, flowers, and other things come out in the evening, because these things are to be sold every morning.

When we enjoy those things, we don't think of the tears of the simple villagers who carry them out.

I once inquired with a villager selling firewood.

It costs three yuan a month to get a pass, and a dime for a load of things when it is carried through the entrance. The intangible cost is at least two dimes a day. It costs money to buy food, and it also costs money to stay overnight.

"Sir! This is our business, and we have to add physical strength and foot strength.

The villagers entering and leaving Hongqiao Road are carrying a heavy and melancholy heart.

Chapter 3: Admiring the Portrait to Remember the Old Patriot, Asking the Illiterate to Learn Characters from the Little Teacher

There is a small patch of grass around, surrounded by iron chains. People often like to take pictures next to the iron chains. Today, there are quite a few people coming in and out of this museum. Because Miss Jin often comes here, she is very familiar with what items are displayed in each room, so she can guide and point out everything. Each commemorative item has a brief description, but they don't even bother to look at it closely. Later, they were led to a place where a framed, enlarged photo was hanging. Miss Jin said to the two Miss He, "This is my father's portrait." When they looked at it, it was indeed a military officer in uniform. But the appearance was not very stern. After saying it, Jin Danyun's face was somewhat like her father's. Obviously, this Brigadier General Jin was a scholar-general. At this time, the He sisters quickly stood in awe and bowed to the photo in salute. He Liyu said, "We must also offer another bouquet of flowers before General Jin's portrait." Jin Danyun said, "Thank you! The two sisters have already offered flowers at the grave just now." The museum is a three-story building, even just taking a quick look at each room already takes up a lot of time. After walking out of the museum, the library is next to it. Miss Jin said, "I can say that this library is not worth seeing. Let's just go there and take a look." They walked into the library. Although the library building is not large, the reading room is very spacious. Inside, there were all kinds of people reading books and newspapers. Some were students, some were tourists, some were old men, and some were children. The two He sisters had also been to many foreign libraries when they were abroad, and they found them to be very clean and tidy. There were also some science libraries, which were all people with knowledge who went in to read. They had never seen such a small library before. Although Miss Jin said that it was not worth seeing, they were moved by curiosity and wanted to go in and take a look. The two He sisters walked to a row on that side, and there was an old man and a child sitting side by side. The old man was about fifty years old, and his hair was already gray. The child was about ten years old, wearing a school uniform, clearly a primary school student. They seemed to be looking at a book together, and the primary school student was gesticulating as if he was explaining it to the old man. The two He sisters wanted to know what book they were reading, so they quietly walked behind them. They only saw that it was a magazine, and the cover had the words "Agricultural Knowledge" written on it. Because there were many people in the library, even if someone noticed them, they didn't feel it. (29)

### A Sense of Right and Wrong

â Moxie

This is one right, that is one right, right and wrong are originally difficult to determine. Some people even say that right is wrong, and wrong is right, because what is right here may be wrong there, and vice versa, what is wrong there may be right here. White and slender women are considered beautiful by most civilized countries, but in Africa, black, fat, and short women are considered the ultimate in beauty. There are countless other examples, of course.

Because each is right in its own way, and each is wrong in its own way, and because they cannot agree on what is right and wrong, disputes, quarrels, and even fights occur between individuals, and protests, diplomatic breaks, and even wars occur between countries. Arguing over some right and wrong leads to "trouble."

But is there really no absolute standard for right and wrong? Not necessarily, there are standards after all. Taking beauty and ugliness as an example, loving beauty and hating ugliness is a consistent right, although the standards of beauty and ugliness are different. Furthermore, from ancient times to the present, from China to abroad, there are also many unchanging truths that have defined the scope of right and wrong, as unbreakable as people eating rice and dogs eating feces. The so-called unchanging truths include: benevolence, righteousness, trustworthiness, peace, justice, ... etc. No one dares to say, or will say, that these virtues are bad, are "wrong," and should not be developed but eradicated by us humans.

However, "smart people" - in fact, shameless people - have the ability to distort facts and reverse right and wrong. They say that invasion is goodwill. They say that killing, arson, rape, looting, and doing everything are punishing the people and saving them from fire and water. They say that monopoly and hegemony are maintaining common interests and opening doors. They say that asking others to be their slaves and be used by them is being their friends and sharing prosperity. ... In short, they clearly know what is right and what is wrong, but they do not hesitate to make wrong right and right wrong, and they want others to be as unclear about right and wrong as they are, and to officially follow their right and wrong.

I think, if they continue to make trouble like this, maybe one day it will become a habit, their conscience will be wiped out, and they will truly recognize wrong as right and right as wrong. Therefore, if we want to eat rice, maybe they will say that rice cannot be eaten, we should eat feces, or they will say that feces are rice, or they will say that they have always eaten feces and will continue to eat feces in the future.

Recently, it is said that these troublemakers are everywhere drumming their tongues like a meal, reversing black and white, and especially publicizing their heresies, wanting us to "cooperate" with them and take their right and wrong as our right and wrong. I think, "Everyone has a sense of right and wrong, we may not be fooled by them. I say, 'Those who have no sense of right and wrong are not human!'" Those who echo heresies will become people who do not eat rice and become dogs who eat feces!

### "A Quick Temper Meets a Slow Doctor."

â Ye Huo

### Paper Marks

â Ye Yin

The red and green waves of light filling the city streets had already made the heart of Gardener Er, who had suddenly fallen into the sea of people, beat non-stop, not to mention the valuable thing he had with him.

Yes, Gardener Er was full of joy. It could be said that he had never been so happy before. Even when he was a child, sleeping in his mother's arms all day long, he didn't feel so comfortable; this was simply a miracle in his life: a thousand marks, my God, how much Chinese money would that be worth?

He still remembered the horror of that night. That night, he was lying in bed, drowsily falling asleep, when suddenly there was shouting outside the door, and the sound of footsteps didn't seem to be from one person. Finally, the door was opened. Soon, he was dragged out of the quilt like a chick, tied with straw ropes, and led outside. At the same time, there were already many people tied up.

No one could predict whether they would see the sun the next day; but unexpectedly, they were sent to a desolate wilderness.

But the shadow of the whip shone behind everyone's heads, and everyone had to lower their heads and mechanically move with the rake, letting sweat drip to the tip of their noses. The blood in their hearts, however, was running frantically.

Finally, the trench was dug into a winding line, and they understood that they were holding the butcher's knife and personally slaughtering their own brothers. They temporarily succumbed to the curse of the whip.

On the day of completion, joy was evident on those flushed faces. They heard everyone's tired moans and couldn't help but smile ferociously.

Then they mysteriously distributed some colorful pieces of paper, and he was also given one. Then he heard the words of that Ã traitor:

"ÃÃ never stints on people who do things. Now, you are free again. The colorful things you have in your hands are German notes - mark notes, with a large amount: one thousand yuan, so I say ÃÃ people will not stint on people."

Of course, he couldn't completely believe it, and his face showed suspicion. But that person spoke again:

"Once you get to Shanghai, you can ask the small money shops to exchange it. Exchange, do you understand; exchange means exchanging for Chinese money..."

Gardener Er's mind was filled with all kinds of fantasies. He had previously tried to find a way to work as a gardener for foreigners, and now maybe he was in luck, using a lot of foreign money.

He arrived in Shanghai like this: the city streets were so bustling. He thought for a long time, and then regained his composure before realizing that he was still standing on the road.

Go exchange it, he urgently needed some money. He had already used his meager money for travel expenses, and because he had a large sum of money on him, he spent it more generously.

So, he went to find the money shop to exchange it.

He had asked people, and they had pointed him in the direction. He came to a shop that didn't look very much like one with trepidation.

He carefully looked at it several times, hesitatingly walked back and forth. Finally, he decided, he stepped forward:

"Sir! Is this a money shop that exchanges money?"

The man with glasses showed a disdainful expression on his face and only hummed an "um" through his nose.

Gardener Er couldn't help but feel overjoyed. He began to fumble. His slow hands and feet made him even more annoying. He finally fumbled out a paper package. He carefully opened it, removed several layers of newspaper, and presented the colorful banknote that was like his life.

The man with glasses pinched the colorful paper with two fingers:

"Paper mark."

"That's right, it's a mark, I even forgot the name."

"..."

"They said it's worth a thousand yuan."

"Hum! It used to be a thousand marks, now it's not worth a penny."

The man with glasses threw the colorful banknote on the glass counter and turned his head.

Gardener Er looked blankly at the man. Suddenly, everything went black before his eyes, and the surrounding scenery changed abruptly.

### Taiwan Anecdotes

â Zou Xiao

ââ Folk Novel Commentary

This book was written by Jiang Risheng in the early Qing Dynasty, chronicling the story of Zheng Chenggong and his descendants. It begins with a preface by Chen Qiyong of Minyuan, dated Jia Shen of the Kangxi era, and a "Genealogy of the Zheng Clan." There are original editions by the Qiu Wu Bu Huo Studio, typeset editions by the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper, and lithographic editions in the "Comprehensive Collection of Notes and Novels" published by the Civilization Bureau. It comprises thirty volumes. Each volume is prefaced with a seven-character couplet, suggesting each volume is treated as a chapter. This is the only chaptered novel included in the "Comprehensive Collection of Notes and Novels." Strictly speaking, if the seven-character couplets are removed, this book would not be significantly different from ordinary classical Chinese notes like "Qie Fen Lu."

Given that it is a work from the early Qing Dynasty, perhaps to avoid falling foul of censorship, the writer of the preface inevitably displays a tendency to favor the alien race: "Chenggong, bestowed the imperial surname by Longwu, fled overseas, upholding the defunct dynasty for thirty-seven years, upholding righteousness and maintaining integrity, almost a legacy of Tian Heng. Yet, from the perspective of our dynasty, he was merely a wandering spirit of the vanquished state, a desperate soul in a remote corner of the sea, guilty of border incursions and resisting transformationâwhat more can be said! Respectfully, our Emperor's divine accomplishments and sagely brilliance surpass all ages; Zheng's rebellion was suppressed, his submission was embraced. Furthermore, His Majesty's boundless benevolence and extraordinary leniency have culminated in the unified rule of China and the outside world, with an enduring foundation established for myriad years." I believe that even under environmental pressure, such words exceed the bounds of tolerance. It seems these words were not spoken out of necessity, but rather contain an element of flattery and ingratiation. In this case, there is no basis for defending Chen Qiyong.

Jiang Risheng was a native of Fujian. As a Fujianese writing about Fujian affairs, he naturally had access to many materials unknown to people from other provinces. The recent "Ming Yanping Prince's Taiwan Maritime Kingdom Chronicle" by Yu Zongxin utilized this book as one of its important sources.

This book takes Zheng Chenggong and his descendants as its main thread, and the turmoil at the end of the Ming Dynasty as its secondary thread. Notable examples include volume four, which describes Emperor Chongzhen's suicide at Coal Hill, and volume five, which describes "Huang Daozhou's heroic death in Nanjing."

The section on Zheng Chenggong only covers volumes six to twelve. Among these seven volumes, only volumes ten to twelve are relatively engaging. Because it is written in classical Chinese and lacks imaginative richness, there are few points of merit. Even the relatively well-depicted Gan Hui fails to display his personality. However, this book seems slightly better than "Seven Peaks' Remaining Writings."

Jiang Risheng's attitude is the same as that of the preface writer. For example, volume six states: "Chenggong led Lin Xishan, Gan Hui, and others to attack Tong'an," and "The bandit forces were vast." Referring to Zheng Chenggong as a bandit, his attempt to recover lost territory is considered a border invasion by bandits. Volume ten states: "Liang Huafeng, because the sea bandits directly entered Gua Zhen, detoured to Jiangnan." Even the third-person perspective refers to Zheng Chenggong as a sea bandit, which is a regrettable oversight. However, the author does not excessively insult Zheng Chenggong, and some even say the author "implied a subtle sense of sorrow," which is somewhat comforting.

### Amidst the Flames of War

â Zhou Yan

Just as they were arguing and speculating in this manner, the elementary school principal, Lu Yaojin, silently stood with his hands behind his back, looking at the map of China hanging on the left-hand wall. After a while, he pointed to a spot on the map with one finger, turned around, and exclaimed with great delight:

"Found it! It's here, it's here!"

His exclamation caused everyone in the hall to gather around to look. Cai Hefeng drew a line on the map with his finger and said triumphantly:

"Didn't I say it was in Pudong? This winding black line is the Huangpu River. Although Jinshanwei is below, from the map's orientation, it's still on the east side. So, Punan can also be said to be Pudong."

Yang Yueliang ignored his smugness, reached out to adjust his reading glasses on his nose, and suddenly exclaimed in surprise:

"What's this? Hangzhou Bay? Could it be that the Ã army is attacking Hangzhou again?"

"No, Hangzhou Bay is far from Hangzhou." Lu Yaojin shook his head repeatedly, saying, "They're definitely not going to attack Hangzhou. They're outflanking Shanghai's rear. Look, from Jinshanwei going north, across the Huangpu River, isn't that Shanghai?"

This statement caused everyone to nod in agreement. In any case, the war had not yet posed a direct threat to them, so their conversation carried an indifferent tone. No one noticed that as they gathered around the map to discuss, a young military officer in a serge uniform and an elderly gentleman with graying hair quietly entered the hall. It was Chen, the town mayor, who was quick to notice, and he immediately reminded everyone:

"Commander Ye and Elder Ye have arrived."

His words were met with a burst of cheers as everyone rushed forward to show their courtesy, surrounding Commander Ye and Elder Ye, making it impossible to get through. Elder Ye recognized most of the accompanying guests, nodding to them while introducing them one by one to Commander Ye.

"Please, have a seat! Please, have a seat!" Mayor Chen personally dusted the chair at the head of the table, and the other guests also realized that they were blocking the way, so they quickly made way. Elder Ye initially declined, unwilling to sit in the head chair, but eventually gave in to the urging of the crowd and reluctantly sat down. However, Commander Ye ultimately sat in the next chair down.

"Why so early?" Director Yang Yueliang asked, his face full of smiles, as he and Elder Ye got along very well usually.

Elder Ye placed his ever-present water pipe on the Eight Immortals table, coughed, and pointed to Commander Ye, saying: (3)

### Discussing Spoken Drama and Modern Drama â Starting with Ye Qiuxin

â Bing Du

Thoughts After Seeing "This Grief Knows No End"

Following Xia Peizhen, Bai Hong, and Wang Hanlun, Ye Qiuxin has also jumped out of the film circle and into the ranks of spoken drama.

In order to compare the strengths and weaknesses of spoken drama and modern drama, I went with Brother Bai Zi to see Qiuxin's first evening performance on stage, "This Grief Knows No End."

The Trick of Tian Yun Lou

If it can be considered news, the advertisements of "Model Beauty of 1939" and "A World-Famous Movie Star" were indeed specially arranged on the elevator of Tian Yun Lou for Ye Qiuxin. The arrangements on stage, such as flower baskets and silver screens, were also naturally refreshed, indicating the importance Tian Yun Lou attached to Ye Qiuxin.

Spoken Drama is Not Easy to Perform

However, "This Grief Knows No End" is a tragedy. Throughout the play, Ye Qiuxin played the main character, Wang Shan. But as a film practitioner who suddenly left directing and lacked stage experience, stepping onto the spoken drama stage for the first time and acting alongside spoken drama actors who made a living from it, she appeared stiff in her movements and awkward in her language.

The Script is Not Depraved

It should be said that in the dramatic movement, spoken drama has its own indestructible reasons. In this play, I felt that there were several points that were almost beyond our expectations. First, we should pay tribute to the playwright of "This Grief Knows No End." He also had a forward-looking mind and bold shouts, such as exposing the ugliness of noble families, reflecting the evils of materialism, denouncing the mistakes of feudal marriages, and satirizing the shamelessness of lawyers and police officers. The insertion of humorous material, such as the character of Wang's Sister-in-Law, is especially typical of the lower-middle class. The illustration of the landlord is also very realistic. We cannot say it is depraved. At the very least, we can say that most of it is revolutionary and educational enough. What should be improved are some excessive actions, redundant lines, and obscene dialogues. If the toxins can be completely removed or the theme emphasized, the audience of spoken drama will definitely remain broader and more powerful than the audience of modern drama, which is only built on a small-bourgeois intellectual class.

Qiuxin Should Learn More

Among the actors, the ones playing Wang's Sister-in-Law and the concubine are the most lovable. Their acting skills are completely performed with bold strokes, so realistic and intimate. Qiuxin forgot that this was a spoken drama stage. She was essentially mute, unable to speak in a flat manner. In three dimensions, she had no full-body movements. Leaving the screen, her small, localized movements naturally became like sacrificial decorations on stage. From this, I seem to believe that performing spoken drama is by no means depraved, as long as there is determination to improve. However, Ye Qiuxin, at present, should first put in a lot of solid learning!

### Broadcasting Life

â Tang Bihua

Since the advent of radio stations, it has indeed opened up a new path for all kinds of people in the entertainment industry. In addition to venues and private performances, there is now an extra source of income from radio stations. Some even rely on radio stations for their livelihood. In recent years, radio stations have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Almost every household has a radio. People can sit at home behind closed doors and listen to various songs in nine styles and eighteen tones without spending a penny. They can listen to whatever they want. As long as the machine is turned on, it will emit a croaking sound. Wealthy people are so happy. However, the life of a broadcaster is unspeakably bitter. Outsiders think that the life of a broadcaster is so carefree. For forty minutes, all you have to do is open your mouth, and legal tender will be delivered to your door. In fact, the suffering in this is simply not to be spoken of to outsiders. The so-called "watching others carry burdens without feeling tired," I am also one of these people. Now I will write about the life of a broadcaster to report to the listeners who love to listen to the radio.

The first step in a broadcaster's life is to attract advertisements. This depends entirely on the broadcaster's fame and their usual social skills and agility. Speaking of soliciting advertisements, it is indeed the most difficult thing. Some people are given package deals, and some do not like broadcasting. Unless you are truly famous (i.e., a well-known brand), someone will ask for advice. Otherwise, it is difficult to solicit advertisements by going to people's doorsteps. The so-called "warm face looking at a cold face," but for the sake of livelihood, one has no choice but to endure adversity. If you are lucky and have a chance, you may be able to make a deal. However, nine out of ten times it will not work, and most of the time, you have to rely on friends to introduce you and exchange favors. If you broadcast well, you can continue. If you broadcast poorly, it will be the end of the line. There are two types of broadcasting: exclusive broadcasting and joint broadcasting. Most of them are joint broadcasting. As for broadcasting fees, there is a big difference. In the past, income was still good, but since the war started, business has been difficult. There are more and more broadcasters every day, squeezing each other and cutting prices. As long as you touch your grandmother, she is your mother. As a result, both sides are hurt and the situation is extremely miserable. Some people even broadcast for five yuan a month. This is self-destruction, and it can also be called a black sheep. The reason is that broadcasters lack unity. Some broadcasters also run the streets, the so-called "package programs," but after going through the hands of a runner, the profits are divided, and they do not get any benefits. Therefore, it is more worthwhile to solicit advertisements yourself.

After a broadcaster has finally accumulated advertisements, the second step is to find a radio station and buy time slots, which can be difficult again. Radio stations come in different sizes, and time slots are good and bad. The big radio stations and good time slots are so expensive that you want to cry. If you don't understand business, don't even think about getting on the air. Moreover, they are full of customers. Even if you pay a high price, you can't buy a time slot. They are rare goods to be hoarded, with a hideous and terrifying capitalist face that makes people shy away. On the store side, of course, the bigger the radio station, the better. But to ask them to pay a considerable price is impossible. A broadcaster who wants to save face would rather endure the pain of sacrifice, even to the point of digging into their own pockets. The so-called "dying to save face and suffering alive." But then again, the boss of the radio station especially likes to praise famous brands. As long as you are willing to go, they are willing to let you broadcast even if you don't pay the airtime fee, because they think that if a radio station has a famous brand, there will be more listeners. However, once the radio station becomes strong, then no matter if you are the number one brand, they will charge you the airtime fee. In the end, most broadcasters are doing business for the radio station, like tenants and landlords.

After much effort, finally opening a stall (i.e., buying a time slot, called "opening a stall"), of course, you have to spend money to eliminate disasters. You open your mouth and shout until your throat is hoarse, like a hawker on Shilu Road, or a candy seller on a streetcar. You are loyal and devoted, doing your best until you die to promote it. In the broadcaster's mind, they are the provider of food and clothing, and they dare not neglect it. But there are always unforgiving listeners who will not hesitate to spend three cents on a phone call to the radio station to ask questions, saying that the report is too verbose. It seems that having a radio gives them the authority to monitor the broadcaster, which is really infuriating.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden of the Former Capital (94)

â Xu Muyun

Amateur performers are not necessarily without real talent. In the past, the Jing actors Huang Runfu, Liu Yongchun, and Jin Youshan were all famous Zheng Jing (main painted-face role) and Fu Jing (secondary painted-face role) actors of their time. However, the three of them had different teachers, so their performance styles also differed from each other after they mastered their craft. Today, most of the actors who sing Hua Lian (painted-face roles) all follow the styles of the aforementioned three, but relatively few people study the style of Liu Yongchun. One reason is that Zheng Jing is the most difficult to perform, and the second reason is that Yongchun lived in Shanghai for many years in his later years and took his son, Xiao Heng, to perform in places like Yantai and Harbin. Therefore, people in the former capital gradually forgot the name Liu Chun (Liu Chun was his real name). Huang Sanben was a servant in the Imperial Household Department. At that time, the Southern Troupe was under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Department, so he saw many famous actors. He had a good talent, so he often performed a few plays for fun. Later, he was dismissed from his post for performing as an amateur, so he simply became a student of Qing Si (named Chunpu, who was praised as having equal beauty with Cheng Changgeng in performances in the palace) and went into the professional world. At that time, there was a Ye Zhongding who specialized in treacherous hero roles and was very popular with the audience. Huang San thought that his voice was not very suitable for the Zheng Jing style and was not as good as He Guishan, whose voice was like gold and stone. So he focused on studying treacherous hero plays such as "Wancheng," "Three Beats," "Down the Hedong River," and "Yangping Pass." Later, he actually earned the nickname of "Living Cao Cao." In his later years, he simply did not sing any play other than Cao Cao's plays. Therefore, the six characters "Living Cao Cao Huang Runfu" became well known to everyone. In fact, he also performed Jiao Zan, Meng Liang, Niu Gao, Zhang Fei, etc., very well, especially his portrayal of Huang Gai in "Heroes' Meeting," which was truly amazing and unique. When Huang Gai was punished, he had a long passage of rapid-fire lyrics that were difficult to sing, but Huang San sang it with many good melodies. Now, let me write down that lost old lyrics. I am afraid that Hao Shuchen, who claims to be a descendant of the Huang school, may not even have retained this passage.

### Crying Down the Great Wall in the Midst of Storms

Mingxing Film Company's first costume film "Meng Jiangnu" will be screened today at the Jincheng Grand Theatre. "Meng Jiangnu" is a long-standing folk tale with a full sense of social consciousness. After being adapted by Wu Cun according to his recent successful work "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" and actively targeting reality, it sweeps away old mistakes and weaknesses, making people not only sympathize with Meng Jiangnu's chastity, but also witness Wan Xiliang as a heroic patriot. We firmly believe that China now needs this kind of film, and even more so needs the patriots and virtuous women portrayed in this film.

The script's structure and consciousness are as described above. In terms of art and technology, it also has lofty and indelible traces. In terms of acting, Zhou Xuan is naturally uniquely lovely. Performances such as the secret meeting in the West Chamber, self-consideration under the lamp, farewell at the long pavilion, assassination of the thief in the ancient castle, as well as crying at the city and passing the customs, all have extremely accomplished performances. She is a truly red star in the Chinese film industry. In addition, newcomers from the Mingxing Training Institute, such as Xu Feng and Yi Ying, are also very competent. Comedians such as You Guangzhao, Han Langen, and Duan Xiucen all have unexpectedly humorous performances that can make you feel a spicy taste in your laughter.

In the technical part, the first to be mentioned are photography and sound recording. These two have always been the reason why Mingxing Film Company stands at the highest peak of the Chinese film industry. However, in this play, there are even more advanced contributions. For example, photography has shown an emphasis on the effort of time and space. We can feel that this is due to the ability to accurately use many different lens effects. As for the beauty of the composition, that is extra. The sound recording is also very good and meets the standards. In particular, "low-key" has amazing success. For example, the gasping of Meng Jiangnu in the storm. If it were not for the best machinery and the best talent, it would not be possible. The clothing and scenery are also quite exquisite. According to the Yu Cheng Grand Theatre, there were three blockbusters competing for their screening rights on the old New Year's Day, and now "Meng Jiangnu" has been selected. Here, we also think there is reason to, so we dare to recommend it to readers.
