### Japanese Troops Suddenly Land on Hainan Island; Chinese Defense Forces Are Resisting; Violation of Promises to France; France Will Lodge Strong Protests; Philippine Islands, Hong Kong, and Singapore Transportation Also Face Major Threats; Naval Personnel of Various Countries Closely Monitoring its Development

British Government Considers the Situation Serious

(Hong Kong) A joint force of Japanese naval and army troops, aided by over twenty Japanese warships and transport ships gathered near Beihai, landed on Hainan Island at 4:30 this morning and advanced inland. Chinese defense forces are resisting. The Japanese flagship Izumo is currently cruising near Tokyo Bay, and Oikawa is also on board. The situation in eastern Guangdong has gradually become tense in the past two days. Over two hundred Japanese infantry and artillery soldiers invaded Longhua from Zengcheng and made contact with Chinese troops. The sound of artillery fire could be heard in Boluo. (Special dispatch, 10th, 10 PM)

(Hong Kong) According to the Hong Kong Qiongya Chamber of Commerce, the Japanese landed at Lingao Cape in northwestern Hainan Island. Simultaneously, over ten Japanese aircraft patrolled and bombed civilian houses in various locations, causing heavy casualties. Local defense forces are commanded by General Wang Yi, who expressed his determination to defend the territory with all his might. The landing site has a ring road that passes through Chengmai Changfa City to Qiongshan Haikou, located on the Qiongzhou Strait. (Dispatch of the 10th)

(Hong Kong) According to neutral observers, France will undoubtedly lodge a strong protest against the Japanese invasion of Hainan, as the Japanese actions are a violation of the Franco-Japanese agreement designating Hainan as a neutral zone. Britain is also very concerned because this Japanese move will threaten transportation between Hong Kong and Singapore. Neutral sources also claim that the Japanese occupation of Hainan poses a significant threat to the Philippines, as the Japanese have not indicated any intention of withdrawing from Hainan in the future. In addition to being a strategically important location, the island is also the largest producer of raw materials in South China. (Dispatch of the 10th)

(Hong Kong) According to neutral observers, the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island will have major repercussions for the Philippines, as the Philippines originally intended to become a neutral country after achieving independence, and Hainan Island's neutrality was guaranteed by the Franco-Japanese agreement. Today, the Japanese landed in force. If the Japanese establish naval and air bases on Hainan Island, which is only 700 miles from the Philippines, it will pose a significant threat to the safety of the Philippines. (Dispatch of the 10th)

(Hong Kong) Naval personnel of various countries in the Far East are closely monitoring the development of the Hainan Island issue. Various parties here believe that Hainan Island has the potential to become the "Majorca of the Far East." (Note: Majorca is one of the Balearic Islands in the Spanish Mediterranean, and together with Minorca, it forms the core of the Balearic Islands. It is currently in the hands of the Nationalist forces and has been controlled by Italy for some time.) Naval personnel say that Hainan Island is a strategically important island in the Far East, not only because it is only 70 miles from the French leased territory of Guangzhouwan and only 160 miles from French Indochina, but also because the island is conveniently located on the shipping route between Singapore and Hong Kong. The island, together with Taiwan and the Japanese-mandated Caroline Islands, forms a semicircle surrounding the Philippines on its east, west, and north sides. Hainan Island has two deep-water ports, Haihe and Yulin. Haihe is at the northern end of Hainan Island, and Yulin Port is at the southern end of Hainan Island. Although the island is not yet fully developed, it could become a very important naval base in the future. During the Russo-Japanese War in 1895, the Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet, when dispatched to the Sea of Japan for combat, made a complete stopover outside Hainan Island. (Dispatch of the 10th)

(London) Today, the British government considers the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island a serious matter. Hainan Island is a strategically important base from which the Japanese can cut off transportation lines between Singapore and Hong Kong. Officials stated that last year, Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler declared in the House of Commons that Britain and France had made it clear to Tokyo that the occupation of Hainan Island was likely to cause disputes. At that time, Butler also said that if a dispute occurred, Britain and France would help each other when necessary. (Dispatch of the 10th, Associated Press)

(London) Officials have not yet commented on the news of the Japanese landing on Hainan Island, pending further reports. It is claimed that there is reason to believe that since the first Japanese threat to Hainan in June of last year, they have repeatedly hinted that they would eventually land on Hainan sooner or later for military reasons. However, when the Japanese made the above statement, they often attached assurances that they had no intention of occupying the island for long. The Japanese action will inevitably provoke strong protests in the House of Commons. It is heard that some members of parliament, although not directly related to Far Eastern affairs, have paid special attention to the integrity of Hainan Island. When the House of Commons convenes on Monday, the issue of the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island will surely be raised for discussion, and the government will be urged to take immediate and clear action to fulfill the firm warning issued by Britain and France to Japan in June of last year. It is noted that when Japan first threatened Hainan, France immediately sent troops to occupy the Xisha Islands (Paracel Islands), so that France's claim to sovereignty over the islands would not cause external misunderstandings. (Dispatch of the 10th, Reuters)

(Hong Kong) Chongqing telegram: All parties believe that the Japanese landing on Hainan Island is a demonstration against France. (Dispatch of the 11th, 3 AM)

(Hong Kong) Guilin telegram states that Japan's deployment in South China seems to be complete and that it intends to invade again. Fierce battles on all fronts are likely to unfold in the short term. The Chinese side has deployed forces tightly on all lines, and any Japanese incursions will be severely damaged. (Special dispatch of the 11th, 3 AM)

### After Landing, Japanese Troops Advance Towards Qiongzhou; Oikawa Cruises Tokyo Bay on the Izumo

(Hong Kong) According to foreign news, the Japanese Tokyo headquarters announced in a public statement on the morning of the 10th that Japanese troops landed near Dachan in the west corner of Hainan Island before dawn on the 10th and are now advancing towards Qiongzhou. Also, Japanese Navy Commander Oikawa is currently cruising in the Tokyo Bay area on the Izumo. Note that Dachan is an island at the northwestern tip of Hainan Island, about 120 kilometers from Qiongzhou City, with a road connecting it. (Dispatch of the 10th)

(Hong Kong) Over thirty Japanese transport ships and warships, carrying a unit of Japanese soldiers, landed on Hainan Island between 2:50 AM and 3:50 AM this morning. It is reported that there were two landing points for the Japanese troops, one near Daya, between Lingao and Qiongzhou in the northwest of Hainan Island, and the other near Puqian Port, east of Qiongzhou. The purpose of the Japanese landing on Hainan Island this time is to occupy Haikou and Qiongzhou in order to control the Qiongzhou Strait, so that the threat to French Vietnam is even greater than to mainland China. (Express news of the 10th)

(Hong Kong) Tokyo news: The Japanese naval unit that landed on Hainan Island this time is commanded by Vice Admiral Nobushige Shiotani, former Chief of the First Division of the Naval General Staff. Shiotani succeeded Vice Admiral Shiozawa as commander of the Japanese Third Fleet in mid-December of last year. He was promoted to Vice Admiral only in November of last year. (Dispatch of the 10th)

### Japan Seizes the Island with Two Goals: Dealing with Europe and America, Not Just Controlling South China

(Chongqing) As of 3 PM this afternoon, this area has not yet received official information from Chairman Chiang regarding the Japanese landing on Hainan Island, but Chinese authorities here say that they are not surprised by this. Chinese circles here believe that the Japanese have long

Editorial

### The North African Question in the Franco-Italian Quarrel

The African question is closely linked to the European question. In the past century, the activities of the European powers have repeatedly divided the entire African continent, leaving only 370,000 square miles of land out of over 11 million square miles nominally independent, while the rest have been divided by the six countries of Britain, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Belgium. Therefore, in practice, it has become an appendage of Europe and a tail-end of the European political stage for the powers to use their policies in the struggle for competition.

Indeed, since Italy helped the Spanish Nationalist forces capture Barcelona, the aggressive arrogance of fascism has become increasingly fierce. After celebrating the fall of Barcelona, Mussolini intensified his provocations against France, attempting to seize French Tunisia in North Africa. Tunisia is located on the opposite side of the Mediterranean from Italian territory, flanked by Italian Libya and French Algeria, and faces Italian Sicily. Italy has always enjoyed special privileges and has had many immigrants move there over the years. In 1882, France, listening to the encouragement of German Chancellor Bismarck, suddenly occupied the area. It tried its best to implement a policy of naturalizing the Italian expatriates who constituted the majority of the residents, which often caused ill feelings between France and Italy. In 1935, France and Italy concluded the Rome Accord, in which France ceded a portion of its East African colony to Italy, and Italy agreed to renounce the privileges enjoyed by Italian expatriates in Tunisia. However, Italy never wanted to give up its ambition for Tunisia. Now, among the more than 100,000 Italian expatriates in Tunisia, there are already fascist organizations.

Tunisia is the land that Italy must fight for in order to expand its territory in Africa and fulfill its dream of a Roman Empire. After Italy annexed Abyssinia, although it had filled the gap between the two East African territories of Somaliland and Eritrea, it still had no firm guarantee, because the Suez Canal was still in British hands. Therefore, Italy must at least acquire Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to create an entire continental group to combine with its current Italian Libya, and then seize Tunisia. In this way, not only can its seizure of the entire northeast of the central and eastern Mediterranean and the African continent be completed, but its dream of building a Roman Empire can also be realized.

Now Italy has sent 60,000 troops to Libya, threatening Tunisia. If it really wants to invade Tunisia, its current forces are still not enough to support it. Although Libya borders Tunisia and Algeria, Italy only has a narrow strip of land 50 miles south of the Gulf of Gabes to march from Libya to invade Tunisia. The further south route requires a long expedition to the Great Erg Desert. Even if this road can be opened, it must still pass through the passes of the Atlas Mountains to reach the important areas of French North Africa. The supply of such an expeditionary force is quite large and cannot be borne by the impoverished land of Italian North Africa, so it must rely on the Italian mainland to supply this huge supply. If Italy really wants to act so recklessly, it must first defeat France in the Mediterranean, but its naval power is insufficient to compete with France, unless France is forced by circumstances to disperse its fleet to various places, it is unlikely to defeat France. Secondly, in wartime, Italy's navy has only one outlet in the Mediterranean, while France has a line from Bordeaux on the Atlantic coast to Casablanca on the west coast of Morocco in addition to the Mediterranean. Although Italy has now helped the Spanish Nationalist forces capture Barcelona, it can establish an air base along the Spanish coast to cut off France's transportation lines to its African colonies, but the time does not seem to be ripe yet.

Due to military and geographical observations, Italy's increase in troops to North Africa this time will not lead to a large-scale invasion immediately, but is merely a means of bluffing and intimidating that is commonly used by fascists. Its purpose is to use this means to create a serious situation in North Africa in order to leave room for officially raising colonial demands to France in the future. However, France has seen through its hidden motives and resolutely issued a declaration that it will maintain the integrity of its territorial sovereignty with all its strength. Britain also echoed remotely, firmly stating that if France is threatened, Britain will assist France with all its strength, no matter where the threat comes from. However, Italy's dream of building a Roman Empire has not yet been awakened. Does it not know the resistance that its actions will encounter? Therefore, there are still many acts in this play, let us wait for it to unfold. wanted to occupy Hainan Island as a base for invading the southern Pacific. The reason why it has been delayed is the fear of possible disputes with France. Japan seized the island with two goals: first, to put pressure on France and block the route by which French Vietnam transports military supplies into China; second, to establish a base for future operations in southwestern China. Now, taking advantage of the fact that France is focusing on the demands for colonies from Germany and Italy and is unable to effectively resist the Japanese occupation of the island, it has taken Hainan, also to provide support for Germany and Italy in Europe's oppression of France. Chinese authorities here are now watching France's attitude and hope that the self-defense forces organized by the islanders will resolutely resist the Japanese when they invade the interior. (Dispatch of the 10th, Reuters)

(Chongqing) Military figures here are not very concerned about the Japanese landing on Hainan Island this morning, as the Japanese landing on the island was expected. At the same time, although this Japanese move inevitably poses a considerable threat to China itself, the situation is far less serious than that suffered by the colonies of Britain, France, the Netherlands, and other countries. (Dispatch of the 10th, Express News)

(Chongqing) Today, an Associated Press reporter informed various parties of the news of the Japanese landing on Hainan Island. As a result, the following opinions were obtained from observers from Chinese and foreign military and political circles: Chinese political circles believe that the Japanese landing on Hainan Island today is an act of violating the Franco-Japanese Treaty of 1907, in which Japan promised to guarantee the neutrality of Hainan Island. The Japanese side argued that the treaty was long ago and that the situation today is different from what it was then. This is actually "an excuse for criminal behavior and, like the Japanese claim that the Nine-Power Treaty should be abolished to establish a new order in East Asia, an unconscious remark." It is an extremely foolish act for Japanese propagandists to mention the Franco-Japanese Treaty at this moment, no different from slapping themselves in the face. Chinese and foreign observers believe that the Japanese landing on Hainan Island is a military tactic whose main purpose is to deal with European and American countries with interests in the South China Sea, not to deal with China. Since the fall of Guangzhou, Hainan Island has lost its importance in China's defense. The real purpose of the Japanese landing on Hainan Island is to isolate the French naval base of Guangzhouwan and the defenses along the coast of Vietnam, as France has always used the strait between Hainan Island and the Indochinese Peninsula as a shortcut. The Japanese also want to use Hainan Island as a base to place all of Vietnam under the threat of Japanese naval and air forces, rendering France's defenses on Hainan Island useless. In addition, Japan also wants to cut off sea and air transportation between Singapore and Hong Kong. After the Japanese control Hainan Island and the Xisha Islands, they will have cut off transportation between Hong Kong and Singapore. After the Japanese occupy Hainan Island, they can also use their air force to threaten the Philippines from Taiwan and Hainan Island and use Taiwan and Hainan Island as naval bases to attack Manila from the northwest. Therefore, the Japanese landing on Hainan Island is a major offensive against France, Britain, and the United States in the South China Sea, not against China. Even if the Japanese occupy the entire Hainan Island, it is actually irrelevant to China's military situation at present. The Japanese landing on Hainan Island will make Japan the hegemon of the South China Sea. (Dispatch of the 10th, Associated Press)

(Chongqing) Today, a military spokesman here considered the statement made by a Tokyo spokesman today that the Japanese landing on Hainan Island was due to military needs to be inaccurate, as the occupation of Hainan Island has no impact on the war on the Chinese mainland. According to the spokesman, Hainan Island can control Vietnamese ports, cut off traffic between Hong Kong and Singapore, and threaten Singapore, so Hainan Island is of great strategic value. The important significance of the Japanese landing lies in this. It is worth noting what kind of reaction third countries will have to this bold action by Japan. The Japanese fleet attacking Hainan Island apparently came from the Xisha Islands, where many Japanese transport ships and other vessels had arrived two days ago and departed west yesterday. Chinese newspapers all recalled the article in the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907 in which both parties guaranteed the peace and security of the nearby Chinese territories, and French Prime Minister Daladier's recent declaration that France would defend the integrity of its country and territory. However, some were secretly concerned that the development of the European situation might affect France's attitude towards the occupation of Hainan. Tonight, a Chinese official answered questions about the Japanese occupation of Hainan, saying that this move has no impact on the consequences of the Sino-Japanese War, as the Chinese army has never used Hainan Island as a base. The Japanese will encounter difficulties in occupying the entire island, as the Chinese on the island have formed self-defense groups and can easily defend the steep mountains to resist the Japanese.

### Japan Publicly Claims to be Unbound by Agreements; Notifies Germany and Italy in Advance, But Not France

(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated at a press conference today that the Japanese invasion of Hainan Island was due to military needs and that the Japanese landing on the island did not violate the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907. (Dispatch of the 10th, Reuters)

(Tokyo) According to front-line telecommunications, Japanese troops suddenly landed on Hainan Island this morning. The left wing landed first at 2:50 AM, followed by the right wing at 3:05 AM, and is now advancing inland. Foreign reporters asked a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907, and the spokesman read out the full text of the agreement, saying that the agreement guarantees peace and security in Chinese areas adjacent to French and Japanese territories, but does not mention Hainan Island. The spokesman also said that China and France had exchanged notes stipulating that Hainan Island should not be ceded, but that Japan was not bound by this agreement. The spokesman concluded that the Japanese military action in Hainan Island did not violate any terms of the Franco-Japanese Agreement. (Dispatch of the 10th, Reuters)

(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that Japan's military action in Hainan Island did not violate the Franco-Japanese Treaty of 1907. It is claimed that since the treaty was signed, the environment has been very different from the past, so Japan cannot but be bound by this treaty everywhere. The current issue is not to prevent chaos in China, but to occupy an important Chinese military base. The purpose of Japan's current action is to eliminate the Chinese army there. At the same time, after occupying the island, Japan can control Yunnan, as Yunnan is currently an important point for the import of Chinese military supplies. When asked if Japan's intention was to cut off the military supply line between China and Annam, the spokesman said that Japan had protested to France before, but France had not yet responded. However, Japan has not yet notified France of its actions and intentions in Hainan Island this time. When asked if Japan had notified Germany and Italy about this, the spokesman smiled and said, "Of course." (Dispatch of the 10th, Associated Press)

(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island did not violate the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907. The purpose of signing this agreement at that time was to prevent internal strife, because the late Qing Dynasty failed to maintain peace and order. Later, the internal unrest in China was settled, but since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the military area has extended to all of China, and Hainan Island has also become an important Chinese military base. The purpose of Japan's recent military action is to destroy China's military strength, which has nothing to do with maintaining peace and order as stipulated in 1907. It was also said that the exchange of notes between China and France in 1897 stated the desire to prevent third countries from invading South China, but this was a matter between China and France, and Japan was not bound by it. (Dispatch of the 10th, Haitong News Agency)

(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Navy announced today that the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island was motivated by two reasons: one is to strengthen the blockade against China, and the other is to eliminate the National Government's resistance. Since Guangzhou fell and traffic with Hong Kong was cut off, Tokyo Bay has become an important hub for sea transport in South China, and Hainan Island is an important base for transporting military supplies. As the Japanese Navy felt that its power was weak and that the blockade was difficult, it was necessary to destroy the base on Hainan Island. (Dispatch of the 10th, Haitong News Agency)

(Tokyo) According to the Japanese Navy, the Japanese landing on Hainan Island this time was commanded by Vice Admiral Kondo. This "operation is mainly led by the Navy." The spokesman said that Japan hopes to eliminate foreign "misunderstandings" and emphasized that the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island was a military necessity. (Dispatch of the 10th, Associated Press)

(Tokyo) According to a statement made by the military headquarters here this morning, Japanese troops landed on Hainan Island, off the southern coast of Guangdong Province, at dawn today. The landing troops included the Japanese Army and Navy. The purpose was to strengthen the blockade of the South China coast. At the same time, the Japanese army will use the coast as a base for the army and air force to attack Guangxi. It is pointed out here that after the Japanese army occupies the Hainan coast, it will be easier to control traffic between South China and French Vietnam and British Singapore. It is worth noting what attitude third countries, especially France, will take towards this action by the Japanese army. (Dispatch of the 10th, Haitong News Agency)

(Tokyo) At 9:55 AM today, the Japanese General Headquarters' Army and Navy Group issued an official report stating that Japanese Army and Navy troops had suddenly landed on Hainan Island at dawn this morning. The landing troops included "elite troops" and proceeded to advance inland immediately. The exact location of the landing is still unknown. The official report did not mention whether the Japanese troops encountered any resistance when landing. (Dispatch of the 10th, Associated Press)

### Japan Repeatedly Provided Assurances to France; Now Violates Promises, France Expresses Surprise

(Paris) After the news of the Japanese troops landing on Hainan Island in China reached here, French officials, without receiving a formal report from Tokyo, refused to comment. They stated that whenever the French government felt Japan intended to occupy the island, it inquired with the Japanese government, which each time provided assurances, declaring it had no such intention. If this occupation is true, it directly contradicts those assurances. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

(Paris) After the news of the Japanese troops landing on Hainan Island in China reached here, French authorities commented that the Japanese move has created complications in Franco-Japanese relations, because if Japan establishes a military base on the island, French Indochina would face a severe threat. According to the exchange of notes between China and France in 1897, the Chinese government should maintain the status quo of the island and never cede it to a third country. If Japan now occupies it, the situation on the island will inevitably change. Although Rear Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy, provided assurances that his country had no aggressive intentions toward French territories, French Indochina is indeed threatened by the Japanese landing on Hainan Island, a real situation. Regarding the Hainan Island issue, the Japanese side previously stated that the French and Japanese governments had not established any agreement. In fact, since the island does not belong to France or Japan, how could the two sides sign an agreement? However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, the French and Japanese authorities have repeatedly exchanged views, and the Japanese authorities have repeatedly provided assurances, stating that they had no intention of occupying the island. The Japanese troops have now landed on the island, which violates this promise. In addition, the foreign policy announced by the Japanese authorities opposes the interests of all countries in the Far East. Learning from past experience, France finds it increasingly difficult to trust Japanese actions. Accordingly, the appointment of a new Japanese ambassador to France will inevitably become more difficult. (Note: The Japanese government had planned to send Tani Masayuki as ambassador to France, but the French government refused to agree because Tani Masayuki's remarks were not very friendly to France.) (Havas News Agency, 10th)

(Tokyo) At dawn this morning, Japanese troops invaded Hainan Island in Tokyo Bay. The island has long been regarded by France as a crucial factor in the defense of Vietnam. The western coast is less than 140 miles from the Vietnamese coastline at its closest point. According to an official communique issued by the Japanese Army Headquarters in Tokyo this morning, at dawn this morning, Japanese army and naval units closely cooperated and suddenly landed on the island. After consolidating their positions, they are now advancing inland. Details of the battle are still unknown. It is reported that certain parts of the Japanese army and navy have long advocated occupying Hainan Island. It is said that a certain part advocating this policy has urged the rapid occupation of the island as a base, and to invade along the Vietnamese border to the extent necessary to prevent military supplies from being transported from Vietnam into the Chinese mainland. According to the exchange of documents between the French government and the Chinese government in March 1897, China stated that it would not cede any part of Hainan Island to a third country. In 1907, representatives of the French and Japanese governments signed a treaty in Paris, in which both sides promised to respect the independence and integrity of China, and specifically stated that they would guarantee peace and security in the lands neighboring China and under their sovereignty, protection, or occupation. Although the treaty did not mention Hainan Island, international law experts believe that this refers to Hainan Island. (Reuters, 10th)

### Japan Blocks the Pearl River, Refuses Passage to Foreign Warships

(Guangzhou) The naval talks held on the American gunboat "Mindanao" are still without result. The Japanese side continues to insist on an indefinite closure of the Pearl River, prohibiting any foreign warships from sailing in the Pearl River. Therefore, the American warship "Mindanao," which was originally scheduled to sail to Hong Kong today, has been unable to set sail as a result. British and American consular officials commented on this situation, declaring that they believe there is absolutely no reason for the Japanese authorities to close the Pearl River.

### Fierce Fighting in Central Hebei; Japanese Side Commanded by Sugiyama, Vows to Eliminate Guerrilla Forces in Hebei

(Tianjin) According to news received here, there is currently extremely fierce fighting in central Hebei Province. Japanese troops are advancing westward from Ding County, Baoding, Xushui, and other places, attempting to eliminate the guerrilla forces in central Hebei. Chinese troops in Hejian, Anguo, and other places fought a bloody battle with the Japanese for three days and three nights. Eventually, due to the destruction of fortifications, they withdrew to the southwest suburbs to continue the resistance. (Express News Agency, 10th)

(Beiping) The Japanese army claims that it is determined to suppress Hebei Province. It has now occupied the cities of Anguo (transliteration) and Hejian in the central part of the province. The current operations of the Japanese army are commanded by General Sugiyama, taking the direct approach to the Pinghan and Jinpu railways. These two cities have been defended by Chinese troops since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. (Reuters, 10th)

(Chongqing) Today's Xinhua Daily News carries a special dispatch, stating that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which are closely linked to the Chinese Communist Party, are extremely active in Hebei, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces. The Eighth Route Army units commanded by General He Long attacked Renqiu, east of Baoding, and finally recaptured it on New Year's Day. The New Fourth Army units commanded by General Ye Ting are also extremely active along the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway and the Wuhu-Xuancheng Highway. On February 4, Danyang was attacked by guerrillas, who entered the city through the west gate. (Reuters, 10th)

### Japanese Troops Reinforce Between Penghu

Fuliang It is reported that Japanese troops are continuously increasing their forces between Penghu, and it seems that they may invade the mainland from the Penghu Islands. Also, between Madang and Dingshan, 4,000 to 5,000 Japanese troops were added on the 5th, and there are also attempts to attack the Chinese army. (10th dispatch)

### Jin Chinese Army Counterattacks Victoriously; Wenjiazhuang Recaptured; Japanese Casualties Reach Hundreds, Trapped in Anyi City, Dare Not Come Out Again

Guanyintang The Japanese army in Anyi launched a fierce attack on Wenjiazhuang, controlled by the Chinese side, taking advantage of the heavy fog a few days ago. The Chinese army resisted bravely, but due to the disparity in numbers, Wenjiazhuang fell into Japanese hands. That night, Chinese reinforcements launched a counterattack and recaptured Wenjiazhuang. The Japanese army retreated in disarray. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue. At this time, the Red Spear Society of Anjiagou automatically joined the battle. Japanese casualties reached hundreds. They are now entrenched in Anyi City, afraid to come out again. (10th dispatch)

Yuanqu In recent days, the Chinese army has been extremely active in destroying the railway on the Tongpu Line. The Tongpu Railway has become fragmented, and the Japanese army is panic-stricken.

At 9 pm on the 8th, a certain Chinese battalion, along with 150 to 160 civilians, destroyed four li of railway between Lingshi and Suotuzhen. On the night of the 6th, a part of the Chinese army destroyed two li of railway between Qicheng Village and Chengnan Village in Qixian. A certain Chinese battalion forcibly destroyed more than 50 meters of railway near Pingyao on the night of the 6th. The railway in Qiegong Village near Taigu was also forcibly destroyed by a certain Chinese battalion for more than 700 meters. (10th dispatch)

### Spokesman of the Military Council Announces One Week of Battle Situation (Continued)

The Japanese troops on all fronts in Shanxi Province have intensified their attacks on us in the past week. However, our loyal and brave soldiers have been able to create great battle results with a spirit of fearlessness. After the failure of the Japanese troops in southern Shanxi to attack Zhongtiao Mountain, more than 2,000 infantry and cavalry from Zhen County, with more than ten mountain guns, divided into three routes to attack us. After our army severely attacked them at Yuantou Village, Yangzao Village, and Hanzao, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses and released a large amount of asphyxiating poisonous gas to assist in the battle. Subsequently, our reinforcements divided and fired from the north and south sides. The Japanese forces were greatly reduced. They are currently still in a stalemate in the area east of Yuli, Wangjiali, and Guanyazhuang, and fierce battles continue. The Japanese troops in eastern Shanxi increased to more than 5,000, and divided into three routes to attack Liaoxian from Heshun. Because the Japanese released a large number of poisonous gas bombs, we temporarily withdrew. Subsequently, our fresh troops launched a courageous counterattack and finally defeated the stubborn Japanese army, killing 500 to 600 Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops fled north. Our army formally recaptured Liaoxian on the 1st, and is now continuing to attack Heshun. The Japanese army is in a state of panic and is trying to flee. In addition, there were battles between China and Japan in Wutai in northern Shanxi, Wenxi, Lingshi, Xiaxian, and Yuxiang in southern Shanxi. The Japanese have not succeeded in any of them. In the Battle of Yuxiang, a certain Japanese commander was killed by us again, and the morale of the Japanese army has been extremely shaken.

The Japanese troops in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces have recently launched strong attacks on our guerrilla areas north of the Yellow River. Our officers and soldiers are as brave as one against a hundred, and their prestige is greatly enhanced, giving the Japanese army the strongest and fiercest blow. In the Dazhao area, more than 500 Japanese soldiers were annihilated. In the Battle of Qinyang, a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed, causing the Japanese to flee in panic, and there has been no progress.

The Japanese troops in Dongliu, Huangshan, Yangjiadun, Yangjiatao, and other places downstream in southern Anhui Province attacked a certain position of ours a few days ago. After our army bravely fought back, they are still in confrontation.

On the Jiangnan front, a small-scale battle occurred between us and the Japanese at Hexi near Changxing. Our Huachang Bridge position was once lost, but it was recaptured after a counterattack. There is no change in the current situation.

Comprehensive view of the battle situation this week, the northern front is relatively fierce, while only sporadic battles have occurred south of the Yellow River. All our soldiers and officers are determined to kill the enemy and move forward courageously. They have indeed inflicted the most serious and painful blows on the Japanese army's attempts to invade. It is believed that any of their conspiracies and tricks will definitely not be realized. (8th dispatch)

### No Changes on Jingzao Front; Chinese Army Adopts Monitoring Attitude; Japanese Continuously Reinforce Jing Mountain, Coercing Civilians to Rush to Repair Highways

Zaoyang The Japanese troops in Yingshan and Anlu have recently transferred some troops back to Wuhan. As a result, the Japanese troops in Xihe have been continuously patrolling with tanks and shelling the Chinese side, making a show of force and pretending to attack. (10th dispatch)

Zhongxiang There are no changes on the Jingzao front line. The Chinese army still takes a monitoring posture. The Japanese army has recently been continuously reinforcing Jing Mountain.

(Chongqing) All Chinese newspapers here unanimously published the righteous deeds of Zhang of Hefei and his entire family who died as martyrs in a prominent position, stating that after Hefei fell last summer, the Japanese military authorities ordered Zhang, a local gentleman, to serve as the president of the Hefei puppet Peace Maintenance Association. Zhang sternly refused. Then the Japanese military authorities killed his son. Afterwards, they persuaded Zhang to come out, and Zhang replied, "You have killed my son, and my family has been broken. Even if you kill my whole family, I will not be a traitor and shame my family." The Japanese authorities were furious, and as a result, they brutally killed Zhang and his entire family.

### Britain and France Prepare to Recognize the Spanish Nationalist Government, Conditional on the Withdrawal of Italian Troops; the United States Still Needs to See the Attitude of the Republican Government

(Paris) According to reliable sources here, the French cabinet meeting originally scheduled for this Saturday has been postponed to next Tuesday. The reason for the postponement is said to be related to the recent developments in the Spanish situation. It is said that the French government's diplomatic dilemma caused by the collapse of the Spanish government can be eliminated by the evolution of the situation next Tuesday, so that the French government can consider the issue of appointing an ambassador to the Nationalist government. (Haitong Dispatch, 10th)

(Paris) Political circles here now believe that the French government will hold a cabinet meeting on the 11th of this month to decide on certain conditions being put into practice, that is, to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government. The most important of these conditions is the withdrawal of Italian troops. Left-wing political circles say that the French government is prepared to immediately recognize the Nationalist government, and is based on General Franco's statement that Italian troops will withdraw, and no longer requires any guarantees. The British and French governments are now working closely together on this matter. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)

(London) Regarding the Spanish civil war, Britain and France are actively preparing for the de jure recognition of the Nationalist government. Once the attitude of Prime Minister Negrin and General Miaja, commander of the Central Army of the Republican government, is clear, they will make a definite decision. It is heard that General Miaja also intends to end the war of resistance and has received a diplomatic passport, which has been signed by the British and French authorities, so that he can go to these countries when necessary. In addition, it is heard that the British government has advised the Republican government that regarding the peace negotiation issue, it is sufficient to be satisfied if General Franco agrees to issue an amnesty order and withdraw foreign volunteers, and there is no need to make further demands. At the same time, General Franco is also advised to issue an amnesty order and declare that the volunteers are there to govern a free Spain and are not subject to foreign forces. General Franco's attitude is still unknown, but since the issue of the Mediterranean island of Menorca was quickly resolved due to British intervention, Britain's influence in the Nationalist government has increased. General Franco will inevitably accept the suggestions made by Britain. Sir Horder, the British commercial representative, is scheduled to return to Burgos tomorrow to take up his post, and it is rumored that he is preparing for the recognition of the Nationalist government. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)

(Washington) According to responsible sources here, the United States is not currently considering recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government. It must wait until the Nationalist forces control a larger area of land than before, or the Republican army has completely handed over power to the Nationalist forces before such consideration can be made. People here mostly feel that the Spanish war is still far from over, and is now entering one of its most serious and dangerous scenes. Supporters of the government have now won a victory, causing the Senate to delay the meeting until February 13. It is heard that this move is aimed at preventing the Senate from debating foreign policy and hindering President Roosevelt. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)

### French President to Visit Britain Next Month

(London) French President Lebrun is scheduled to visit in March this year. Although the official program has not been disclosed, the general public believes that after President Lebrun arrives in London, he will be formally received by the British Parliament and will deliver a short speech to Parliament to express his gratitude. Opposition Labour MP Flett proposed to Prime Minister Chamberlain when the House of Commons meets on the 14th of this month to suggest that when President Lebrun visits, the two Houses of Parliament hold a joint meeting in Westminster Hall to receive him. (It has been since 1936, when the late King George V of England celebrated the 25th anniversary of his accession to the throne, that the two Houses of Parliament have held such a grand meeting.) He also said to the press, "This move is a supreme honor and is indeed a real situation, but since the dictators have been extravagant and visited each other, I think that the head of a major democratic country being received by members of another major democratic country in a quiet and simple style should create a great impression internationally." (Havas Dispatch, 9th)

### Benes Arrives in the United States to Lecture

He refused to comment on the Munich Agreement, but expressed great optimism about the future of the Czech Republic, saying that the United States is the last solid bulwark of democracy, and he is very happy to be able to come to this land. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)

### Dutch Foreign Minister to Visit Britain in Geneva; to Speak on Oxford Group Movement

(London) Dutch Foreign Minister Patijn is scheduled to come here on the 14th of this month for a visit, and will hold important talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax. The topics to be discussed are: 1. How is the Dutch East Indies positioned after Japan's expansion policy in the Far East? 2. Germany's attitude towards the Netherlands. Regarding this matter, although German leader Hitler said in his speech on January 30 that he had no intention of aggression against the Netherlands, he is currently building airfields near the Dutch border. What is the purpose? People in both Britain and the Netherlands are very concerned. Responsible officials here also said that the independence of the Netherlands is a major condition for British security and should be guaranteed. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)

Amsterdam Dutch Foreign Minister Dr. Patijn is scheduled to visit London on February 15 to preside over the memorial ceremony of the Groot monument in the Dutch Church in London. It is expected that Patijn will meet with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, but officials have tried their best to clarify that this trip has no political significance. It is learned that the Dutch Foreign Minister will also speak on the "Oxford Movement" in London. (Haitong Dispatch, 10th)

### Renewed Discord Between Britain and Italy: Italian Aircraft Bomb British Warship During Talks for the Surrender of Minorca Island, British Commander Protests

(London) It was confirmed here today that the British cruiser "Talbot" was bombed while docked in the port of Minorca. According to reports from Marseilles, the ship's captain, Colthart, telegraphed the National Army authorities on the 8th of this month, protesting the sudden attack by Italian forces while surrender negotiations with the government forces were underway. According to refugees arriving in Marseilles on the British cruiser, fighting had broken out on the island when they left. The Italian aircraft bombed heavily, destroying 30 houses, and the number of deaths is unknown. Some bombs fell near the "Talbot," and shrapnel struck the ship's hull. London officials stated today that the British had reached an understanding with the National Army authorities on Minorca, allowing a cruiser to transport their representatives to Minorca, provided that no air raids were carried out while the ship was in port. It is inexplicable that Italian aircraft carried out the bombing, disregarding this understanding. It is reported that a National Army representative was also hit by anti-aircraft shrapnel. He has immediately asked the National Army authorities to investigate the cause of the air raid. The "Talbot" was not damaged and did not fire at the attackers. It is said that the British cruiser captain, Colthart, volunteered to mediate the negotiations between the two sides on Minorca, but both sides preferred to negotiate directly. These discussions reportedly took place on Tuesday and part of Wednesday. The captain reported that heavy bombing occurred on Wednesday, and he immediately telegraphed the National Army to protest, but the bombing did not stop. He then evacuated 450 refugees, including soldiers, women, and children, from the island. (Reuters, 10th)

Marseilles: The British cruiser "Talbot," carrying 450 refugees from Minorca Island, arrived here today. It is reported that fighting suddenly broke out when Minorca was negotiating surrender with the National Army, and all the refugees said that Italian military aircraft bombed the island. (Reuters, 10th)

Burgos: The National Army government has issued a communiqué stating that after a mutiny by part of the government forces on Minorca in the Mediterranean, the National Army immediately landed at Ciutadella port on the island to provide assistance. This mutinous force, led by Colonel Rodriguez, had virtually occupied the entire island. Most of the government army leaders have fled abroad. (Havas, 9th)

Barcelona: After a mutiny by part of the government forces on Minorca Island, six warships belonging to the National Army sailed to the waters off Ciutadella port on the island to respond. National Army troops also landed under cover of fog and occupied the port without bloodshed. By 2:00 PM today, another 12,000 National Army troops landed on Minorca Island on three transport ships and completely occupied the island. (Havas, 9th)

(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports today on the National Army's occupation of Minorca Island, saying that France is most concerned about the island's future. If the island is occupied by those hostile to France, communication between France and its North African territories will be seriously threatened. Britain and France have recently been working to ensure that no one other than the Spanish can gain a foothold on the island. The British authorities allowed the British warship "Talbot" to carry National Army representatives to the island to negotiate the peaceful surrender of the island for this reason. (Reuters, 9th)

(Berlin) The attitude of the British government regarding the Spanish-owned Minorca Island issue in the Mediterranean has been harshly criticized by German newspapers, all of which claim that Britain is interfering in Spain's internal affairs. The "Local Guidance News" reported that Colonel Luis, commander of the National Army on Mallorca, traveled on the British cruiser "Devonshire" to Mahon, Minorca, to negotiate surrender with the local government forces. It is doubtful whether the leaders of the government forces on Minorca were also taken away when the ship left the port. "Although Britain claims to be a neutral mediator, it actually has political intentions in the Mediterranean. The previous expression of friendship by Britain and France toward the Spanish Red government (referring to the Republican government) was purely for their own benefit," it said. (Havas, 9th)

### Chamberlain's Declaration: Italy Says Nothing Surprising; Now Decided to Accelerate Military Preparedness, Mocking France's Self-Satisfaction

(Rome) An officially authorized statement was released here last night stating that those in charge in Rome did not find anything surprising in British Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent speech on British-French unity. The British Prime Minister had made similar declarations during his visit to Rome and in the British House of Commons. French anti-fascists are prone to exaggeration and claimed that Italy was panicked by the British Prime Minister's declaration, but they are only deceiving themselves. In fact, Fascist Italy is not surprised by it, as it has long recognized the existence of a genuine British-French military alliance as a given. This alliance is, of course, defensive in nature, but it is best not to deceive oneself about the meaning of this term. Whether this alliance is for defensive warfare against omnipotent nations or for aggressive warfare is something that must be disregarded; otherwise, the British-Italian agreement signed on April 16 last year and the Franco-German agreement of December 6 will be inexplicable. It would be reckless to guarantee the future lightly. Those in charge in Rome believe that although Italy will continue its peace policy, it must make extra efforts to accelerate and complete the country's military preparations and make them a reality.

(New York) According to the Department of Commerce, U.S. automobile exports in 1938 were valued at US$283 million, a decrease of approximately 21% compared to 1937, but still higher than the five-year average of US$265 million. (Reuters, 9th)

### Situation of Spanish National Army Arriving at French Border; Republican Government Premier Apparently Returned to Valencia

Perpignan: The Spanish National Army has now occupied the city of Puigcerdà, which is located near the French border. (Havas, 10th)

Burgos: The news that the National Army had reached the village of Portos, near the French border, yesterday afternoon caused great jubilation among the people here, who are preparing to celebrate the victory. Since the general offensive against the Autonomous Region of Catalonia began, it has taken 46 days to complete the task, occupying approximately 30,000 square kilometers of land. The Catalan-line government forces have been completely destroyed, and the various important munitions factories in the hands of the government forces have been occupied one after another, with the internal machinery not completely destroyed. (Haitong, 10th)

Le Perthus: The National Army arrived here at 2:05 PM today, causing great chaos among the residents. In the area under Spanish jurisdiction, demarcated by the main street, all the houses were immediately emptied, and the residents fled across the street with all their furniture, entering French territory. Before long, the main street was almost deserted, except for French soldiers guarding every 50 yards. The Spanish Republican government authorities, such as Premier Negrín, Foreign Minister Vayo, and Chief of Staff Rojo, had already left the country before the Nationalists arrived. (Reuters, 9th)

Toulouse: Spanish Republic Premier Negrín and Foreign Minister Álvarez have indeed returned to Valencia City. (Havas, 10th)

Le Boulou: Spanish Republic Premier Negrín arrived here from Le Perthus today to confer with Foreign Minister Álvarez and other cabinet members for a long time before leaving again for an unknown destination. Before leaving, he told visiting reporters, "I do not wish to make any statements during my stay in France." According to well-informed sources, Premier Negrín has already set off to return to central Spain, because whether the government forces continue to resist or negotiate peace in the future, Premier Negrín needs to preside over it in person. (Havas, 9th)

Perpignan: After Spanish Republic Premier Negrín led many key government and military figures to France some time ago, it is said that he plans to return to central Spain in the shortest possible time to continue to preside over the resistance. It is not yet known whether other key figures in the Republican government agree with this move and will follow him. According to a certain military figure, although the government forces can continue to resist, the situation is very unfavorable. (Havas, 9th)

Valencia: It is rumored that General Miaja, commander of the Central Army of the government forces and commander of the Madrid defense, has agreed to conduct peace negotiations with General Franco, commander of the National Army. General Miaja has firmly denied this. (Havas, 9th)

Burgos: A trade delegation sent by the Polish government arrived here today and will immediately hold talks on promoting bilateral trade. (Havas, 9th)

### Fascist Party Supreme Council: No Important Decisions Expected

(Rome) The Fascist Party Supreme Council is scheduled to meet at 10:00 PM tonight, the second meeting in a week. Foreign affairs were discussed in detail at the last meeting, so even if this meeting discusses foreign affairs, it may not last long. However, the Spanish question, especially the Minorca incident, must be discussed. It is expected that no sensational communiqué will be issued after the meeting. (Reuters, 10th)

(Paris) Yesterday, the German Army authorities issued an order to the entire country that reservists born in 1906 and 1907, including citizens of the Austrian province who have not served in the military, should enlist for training from March 21 to May 31, totaling over 600,000 people. In addition, the Italian government decided on January 25 for technical reasons to call up 60,000 reservists from the 1901 class for service and, in accordance with the exchange of military information procedures stipulated in the Anglo-Italian agreement, notified Sir Percy Loraine, the British Ambassador to Italy. Reservists of the entire 1901 class have not received sufficient military training and are now being gradually called up for service. Observers here commented on these two events, saying that in the next two months, Germany will have two classes of reservists in service in addition to the active duty soldiers, and Italy will also have one class of reservists in service in addition to the active duty soldiers. According to news from the British side, the number of troops stationed in the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa is increasing, especially near the border with French Tunisia. All of these are highly noteworthy. (Havas, 9th)

### Improved Political Situation in Yugoslavia: Opposition Parties Support New Cabinet

Yugoslav Capital: After the formation of the Živković cabinet, the leaders of the Serbian and Croatian opposition parties held a meeting here and immediately decided to support the new cabinet in order to find a solution to the Croatian autonomy issue. In addition, during the re-election of the House of Representatives on December 11 last year, the majority of civil servants in Sarajevo voted in favor of the list of candidates put forward by opposition leader Dr. Maček. After learning of this, the former cabinet dismissed or transferred these civil servants. Premier Živković has issued a telegram to the administrative authorities of the city today, allowing all of these civil servants to be reinstated. (Havas, 10th)

(Berlin) After being promoted to Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia, Ambassador to Germany Marković will return to his country to take office. He told the press that his main task in the future is to promote mutual relations between Germany and Yugoslavia so that they can jointly strive to stabilize European peace. "Since Germany annexed Austria, it has now become contiguous with our country. Both sides should maintain a good relationship based on sincerity and trust." During my tenure as Ambassador to Germany, I was deeply grateful for the profound sympathy shown by the German government and public opinion. The Greater Germanic nation, under the leadership of Führer Hitler, will surely become stronger and stronger. (Havas, 9th)

### British House of Commons Passes Increase in Import Duties on Japanese Goods; First Batch Includes Steel Products, Cloth, and Revised Tax on Chinese Frozen Eggs

(London) The British House of Commons today passed the Steel Products Increased Import Duty Act to counter Japanese competition. Labor MP Noel-Baker said that if the mover, Mr. Cross, declared that the act was intended to exclude Japanese goods because Japan manufactured goods with cheap labor and because Japan disregarded British interests in the Far East, then this act would gain greater sympathy from the House of Commons. The Labor Party had previously advocated that all governments should unanimously exclude Japanese goods. The House of Commons then passed the Velvet Cloth Increased Import Duty Act, also to counter Japanese imports and protect the Lancashire cotton industry. (Reuters, 9th)

(London) Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the quantity of frozen eggs produced in China and exported has fluctuated from time to time, and the resulting market price has been extremely unstable. The House of Commons recently passed a bill today to amend the current import duty on frozen eggs, changing the original specific duty to an ad valorem duty. (Havas, 9th)

(Tokyo) It was announced today that the boycott of Japanese goods by democratic countries and the sluggish trade with countries that have always purchased Japanese goods in large quantities have resulted in a 27% reduction in trade inquiries received by the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry last year. A total of 6,036 inquiries were received throughout the year, most of which came from Germany and Italy. Inquiries from various places in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States have all decreased significantly compared to the past, while inquiries from Brazil have increased compared to the past. (Associated Press, 10th)

### Three Japanese Secret Envoys Sent to Europe

(London) The News Chronicle reported that three Japanese secret envoys are currently traveling to Europe on the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde," which set sail from Shanghai on February 1, to present formal instructions at a meeting to be held in Berlin at the end of February. This meeting will take the final steps to transform the Anti-Comintern Pact into a formal military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. The personnel of this mission include Colonel Tateki, head of the European and American Bureau of the Japanese Army General Staff; Rear Admiral Abe, head of the Bureau of the Naval General Staff; and Mr. Ito from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Japanese ambassadors and ministers to various European countries will also attend this meeting. The report continued that the transformation of the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance was delayed because Japan wanted to focus on dealing with the Soviet Union as its primary goal, while Germany and Italy insisted that it should include the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. At the meeting of Japanese ambassadors in Paris last month, it was decided to recommend to the Japanese government that it accept the views of Germany and Italy. This is the reason why the Berlin meeting will be convened soon. (Reuters, 10th)

### Brazilian Foreign Minister Arrives in Washington

(Washington) After arriving here today, Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha immediately told an Havas reporter that the influence of the United States in the countries of South America has greatly diminished. If Pan-Americanism is to succeed, the United States must implement practical policies. I have come here to inform President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull of this. "To date, Brazil is the best customer of the United States. We purchase more American goods than the United States purchases of our goods. This phenomenon needs to be improved." Furthermore, in terms of the number of foreign nationals in our country, there are only 2,000 American expatriates in the capital alone, while there are hundreds of thousands of Italian and Japanese expatriates, who actively participate in various businesses. "In short, the scope of the influence of the National Socialist Party and the Fascist Party in the countries of South America is beyond the imagination of the United States. For now, the United States must implement new policies in diplomacy and allocate huge amounts of funds to remedy the situation." I believe that a world war will break out sooner or later. Therefore, the countries of the Americas must unite. Furthermore, future wars will be ideological wars. Brazil is prepared to fight for the American continent and is unwilling to assume any obligations for the countries of Europe. As for our domestic affairs, there is absolutely no danger of civil war. Half of all German expatriates are Catholics and oppose the new paganism promoted by Germany. (Havas, 10th)

### Progress in Palestine Conference: Arab Factions Reach Compromise

(London) The two factions of the Arab delegation have now reached a compromise and will form a single delegation. The Defense Party will be represented by its leader, Nashashibi, and deputy leader, Farraj. Farraj is also the leader of the Greek Orthodox Christians in Palestine. He is currently in Palestine and has been sent an urgent telegram urging him to come to England. (Reuters, 9th)

(London) Before the start of the Palestine Conference, representatives of both the British and Arab sides gathered in the banquet hall of St. James's Palace tonight. Then, Archbishop Max, representing the Muslim side, proposed a resolution expressing regret for the absence of Nashashibi, the leader of the Arab Defense Party, due to illness. The resolution was unanimously approved by the meeting, and the goodwill of the Archbishop's Party towards the Defense Party was deeply admired. All other Arab representatives were present. On the British government side, Colonial Secretary MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Undersecretary Butler were present as representatives. Arab Higher Committee member Husseini spoke in English in the name of the Palestinian Arabs, stating the circumstances and proposing several solutions. According to well-informed British sources, his speech was very concise and clear, lasting approximately 20 minutes. It was then translated into Arabic. After a brief discussion on the opening procedures, the meeting was adjourned. It is said that the remarks made by Zionist Organization Chairman Weizmann yesterday and the remarks made by Husseini today will be published tomorrow. The British government has decided to publish its criticism of Weizmann's remarks at tomorrow's meeting. The next meeting between the British representatives and the Arab representatives is scheduled for Saturday at 3:30 PM, at which time the British government will express its views on Husseini's remarks.

### Death of Pope Pius XI; Died at the Age of Eighty-Two from Heart Disease; New Pope to be Elected in Eighteen Days as per Custom

(Rome) Pope Pius XI, suffering from acute heart palpitations and a recurrence of old ailments, passed away at 5:31 AM this morning despite medical efforts, at the age of eighty-two. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(Rome) The Pope suffered a sudden heart attack after lunch today. A second attack occurred at 10:30 PM (approximately 7:15 AM on the 10th, Shanghai time), rendering him speechless and unconscious for about three or four minutes. His condition worsened tonight. Although doctors did not issue a public statement, it is reported that the Pope suffered from cardiac asthma and bronchitis. The Archbishop of Milan, Schuster, considered a successor to the Pope, arrived in Rome today. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Vatican City: Pope Pius XI passed away at 5:31 AM this morning. His nephew, Dr. Letti, and key figures of the Vatican were by his side. Cardinal Laurelli administered the last rites. At the time, Pius XI was lucid, and when those attending recited scriptures, he followed along. However, his breathing was faint and barely discernible; only his lips moved. Moments before his death, he made a gesture of blessing with his hand and uttered several words, seemingly "Peace" and "Jesus." Cardinal Pacelli, the Vatican Secretary of State and senior cardinal, rushed to the bedroom upon hearing the news. He slowly unveiled the white veil covering the deceased, gently tapped the forehead with a small silver hammer, and called out the Pope's name three times. He then told those present, "The Pope is dead." He knelt and recited scriptures. Afterwards, those present withdrew. Cardinal Pacelli then took the stole worn by the Pope during his lifetime and placed it on himself, signifying that the Pope's authority had been temporarily assumed by the senior cardinal. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Vatican City: Pope Pius XI passed away in office at 5:31 AM this morning. There is deep grief everywhere. He was eighty-two years old. Given his advanced age and recent heart condition for the past two years, the Vatican had been concerned. Now that he has passed away, the primary matter to be addressed is the selection of a successor. Vatican insiders have already discussed this, and a decision will be made at the College of Cardinals meeting. The most prominent candidate is the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli. He has served as Secretary of State for nine years, managing Vatican affairs with notable distinction, and is adept at dealing with foreign envoys. He was highly regarded by Pius XI and was appointed senior cardinal in 1935. Consequently, he is revered by Catholics worldwide. In addition to Italian cardinals who are likely to support him, cardinals of other nationalities are also expected to vote in his favor. Others with the qualifications to be elected include Cardinal Schuster, Archbishop of Milan, Italy. He was originally endorsed by the Italian government, but in recent years, he has strongly condemned the racism promoted by the Italian and German authorities in his sermons in Milan, causing strained relations with the Italian authorities. However, this has led to greater respect from other cardinals. Another candidate is Cardinal Costai, Archbishop of Florence, Italy. He does not stand out prominently, but he is highly regarded for his scholarship and learning. His political views, especially regarding Fascism, are profound and well-considered. Another is Cardinal Baito, Archbishop of Genoa, Italy. He belongs to the Jesuit order, which is influential. However, no Pope has ever been elected from the bishops of this order. If Archbishop Baito were to be elected this time, it would be an unprecedented event. Other candidates include Cardinal Maglione, the former Vatican ambassador to France; Cardinal Dalla Costa, the former Vatican ambassador to Spain; and Cardinal Rossi. The College of Cardinals consists of sixty-four cardinals, thirty-five of whom are Italian. Therefore, there is a greater possibility that the Pope will be Italian. Regarding international relations, the attitude of the Fascist Party towards the Catholic Church is something that senior Vatican officials are unwilling to express. However, the general perception is that relations between the two are not seriously strained. Therefore, it is unnecessary to seek a non-Italian Pope in order to maintain the status quo and peaceful coexistence. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(Rome) The embalming of the Pope's body was completed at noon today. The coffin was immediately moved to the Sistine Chapel, which tolled mourning bells to express grief.

### Brief History of the Pope

Pope Pius XI was the 260th Pontiff since St. Peter. He ascended to the throne on February 6, 1922, and has reigned for seventeen years. He has achieved much, most notably the signing of the Lateran Treaty with the Italian government to resolve the dispute between the Vatican and the Italian government. (Note: Since the unification of Italy, the provinces under the Pope's jurisdiction have been incorporated into Italian territory, and the dispute arose from this.) He also worked hard to promote missionary work and signed ecclesiastical treaties with Poland, Germany, Prussia, Bavaria, Baden, France, Portugal, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Germany, and Spain. Pius XI also considered himself a modern Pope, promoting science with tireless effort, comparable to the Popes of the Renaissance. His achievements are worthy of being recorded in history and will be remembered for generations. A record of his family background and achievements follows:

Pius XI, whose original surname was Ratti, and given name Achille, was born on May 31, 1857, in Desio, Milan, Italy. His ancestors ran a small business. He served as a priest for thirty years, focusing particularly on education and charitable work. He served as the director of the Ambrosian Library in Milan and used his spare time to write, gaining fame for a time. In 1913, he was appointed by Pope Pius X to go to Rome to serve as the director of the Vatican Library, but until the end of 1914, he still served concurrently as the director of the Ambrosian Library. He traveled between Rome and Milan, tirelessly working. The Vatican Library has a vast collection, and Father Ratti became even more famous for his writings. In 1914, on the occasion of the 700th anniversary of English scholar Roger Bacon, Father Ratti represented the Vatican Library and went to Oxford, England, to participate in the commemorative ceremony. He immediately announced to the public that he had discovered two manuscripts by Bacon in the Vatican Library, making a significant contribution to the academic community. In 1918, when Poland was restored, Father Ratti was ordered by Pope Benedict XV to go to Poland to inspect religious affairs. Subsequently, he was appointed as the first ambassador to Poland. During his tenure, he also represented the Vatican at the Allied Council to handle the plebiscite in Upper Silesia. Subsequently, he was promoted rapidly. In 1912, he was appointed as the Archbishop of Milan. In the same year, the Episcopal Conference re-elected him as a cardinal. Eight months later, Pope Benedict XV passed away, and Archbishop Ratti succeeded to the throne on February 6, 1922, as Pope Pius XI. When he first ascended the throne, he declared that he should only look down on all things in the first year, only silently observe the changes in the world in the second year, and only begin to take action in the third year. But in reality, in less than three years, he had already achieved remarkable accomplishments. In terms of the internal organization of the Church, Pius XI himself served as the head of missionary work. The missionary center of the Catholic Church worldwide was in France. When Pius XI took office, he made Rome the central hub. In 1925, the current Pope wanted to learn about the missionary situation in various places and the achievements of the Church's cultural and humanitarian undertakings, so he launched a missionary exposition in Rome. After the exposition closed, it was converted into a missionary and folklore museum. Not only that, the Pope, in order to promote sanctification, conferred the title of bishop on seven people in various places. As a result, Catholic priests in Japan, China, and Vietnam were appointed as bishops in large numbers. He also organized Catholic Advancement Associations in various places, so that the believers in each place could also assist the local priests in promoting the true meaning of Christ. In addition, Pius XI made great achievements in doctrine and education. Regarding the disputes between the Fascist government and the Vatican, on the issues of marriage and society, and even on the events of persecution of Catholics in Mexico, as well as the world economic panic, he published essays and advocated for solutions. As for science, his contribution cannot be ignored. During his reign, Pius XI strove to develop the academic research institutions established by the Vatican, such as the Pontifical Oriental Institute, the Biblical Institute, and the Gregorian University, and he personally founded the Lateran University and the Pontifical Institute of Christian Archaeology. His achievements are too numerous to mention. When the Vatican and Italy were separated, Pius XI ordered the establishment of a radio station in the Vatican and personally commissioned Marconi, the inventor of radio, to design and construct it for testing, demonstrating his utmost intention to promote science. From then on, people all over the world were able to hear the Pope's voice, reaching even the most remote places. From April 1933 to April 1934, the Vatican held a celebration for the 1900th anniversary of the resurrection of Jesus. This kind of grand ceremony had been abandoned for centuries. At that time, it was the first celebration after the settlement of the dispute between the Vatican and Italy. Although it was during a worldwide economic panic, the number of believers from all over the world who came to Rome to pay their respects reached as many as 2.5 million, which was an unprecedented grand event. As for Pius XI's greatest achievement, it was the signing of the Lateran Treaty and the establishment of the new State of Vatican City. From then on, the 59-year dispute between the Vatican and the Italian government was resolved in one fell swoop. Although after the signing of the treaty, there were disagreements between the Vatican and the Italian government again due to the activities of the Catholic Advancement Association, it was quickly resolved. Since then, the Vatican and the Italian government have been on good terms. All of this is due to the Pope Pius XI's natural intelligence. (Havas)

### Japanese Troops Ambushed and Suffer Losses in Zhuqiao, Pudong; Zhang Huifang's Troops Annihilate Over 20 Japanese Soldiers; Chinese Troops in Western Shanghai Attack Xinlonghua Station

Zhang Huifang, the leader of the Pudong border region people's self-defense corps, has under his command approximately 2,000 troops. His troops are well-equipped and strong, and are quite active in the area of Shangchuan Road. Recently, they have completely destroyed the transportation on the Xianlu railway section of Shangchuan Road to Zhuqiao, demolishing approximately three Chinese miles of railway tracks, so that the Shangchuan Road to Zhuqiao section has been unable to operate for several months. A traitor learned of this situation, and at noon the day before yesterday, gathered over 50 Japanese and puppet troops, carrying mortars, and guided by the traitor, attacked Zhuqiao from Chuansha City. However, Zhang's troops had already learned of the Japanese attack, so they dispatched the special task force under Sun Xinmin and the third battalion under Yang Meiting, a total of approximately 300 brave soldiers, to ambush in advance east of Shizhen. When the Japanese troops arrived at the southern outskirts of Shizhen, a fierce battle immediately broke out. For a time, machine gun and rifle fire were concentrated. The Japanese also indiscriminately fired mortars at the surrounding villages. Before long, the guerrillas attacked the rear of the Japanese troops, firing heavily with heavy machine guns, and surrounded the Japanese troops from all sides. The guerrillas shouted slogans and charged, and their voices resounded through the clouds, further increasing their courageous spirit of killing the enemy. The battle lasted from 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM, for a total of over four hours. The Japanese troops were pursued and killed by the guerrillas, some changed into Chinese clothes and tried to escape at night, and some jumped into the river to escape. Their desperate situation can be seen. In this battle, over 20 Japanese and puppet troops were killed, and three traitors and Japanese interpreters with the surname Zhang were captured alive, and all were executed by firing squad. At the same time, two Japanese military vehicles and six or seven rifles were captured. Three guerrilla soldiers died in the charge, and two were injured. Three villagers were wounded and killed by stray bullets.

Another report: The Japanese troops, because they suffered heavy losses in the southern attack the day before yesterday, were ambushed and suffered heavy losses by the Chinese guerrillas. In order to take revenge, on the night of the 7th, they gathered 300 Japanese and puppet troops and Xu Hongfa's troops from Chuansha City and searched south for the guerrillas, but found nothing. The Japanese also dispatched a unit to garrison Zhuqiao. However, at 5:00 AM on the morning of the 9th, when the sky was not yet bright, they were again suddenly attacked by the Chinese guerrillas, and gunfire broke out. The fighting was quite fierce and did not stop until noon. Casualties on both sides are unknown. Currently, Japanese military transport on Shangchuan Road is busy, continuously reinforcing the battlefield south of Chuansha.

Fierce Fighting in Xinlonghua and Caoging

The guerrillas active in the Sijing and Qibao areas of the western suburbs are all formed by regular troops and militia in coordination, and their strength is quite strong. At 8:00 PM the night before last, with agile night marching, they suddenly attacked the Japanese military stronghold at Xinlonghua Station. A part of the troops attacked the Japanese military headquarters in Caoging. The Japanese troops at both locations responded in haste. In the darkness, they did not know the true strength of the Chinese troops, so they all lay in ambush in sandbags and other defensive objects, blindly resisting with machine guns, and frequently fired small steel cannons to boost their morale. The Chinese troops also had small steel cannons and mortars to assist in the battle, bombarding the Japanese fortifications. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. In the Pudong area and the western district of the French Concession, the sound of cannons was clear. The fierce fighting continued until 4:00 AM yesterday morning, causing heavy losses to the Japanese troops before they retreated.

Chinese Troops Destroy Shangchuan Railway

The Japanese military stronghold at the Caojialukou section of the Shangchuan Railway in Pudong was surrounded and attacked by Chinese troops, and after annihilating over 30 Japanese soldiers, there have been scattered guerrilla battles along the Shangchuan border for several days. Because most of the Japanese troops of the Zhihong unit were transferred out to fight after January 28th, the total strength of the entire line was only over 100 people, so they were constantly rushing east and west, exhausted. On the deep night of the 9th, another team of Chinese troops demolished a section of the Shangchuan railway line above Lujiahang on the Shangchuan border, destroying the main transportation line of the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops did not dare to go out at night, so they did not notice. It was not until after dawn that they sent an engineering vehicle to repair and restore it.

Shangchuan Train Service Suspended Yesterday

The Japanese military defenses on the Shangchuan Railway are weak, and the situation is tense. The Chuansha Zhihong Garrison Unit actually requested assistance from the Nanwei Zhoupu Xiaochuan Garrison Unit. However, the Xiaochuan Unit also did not have many people, and reluctantly dispatched over 200 soldiers, who were transported in two batches at 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM yesterday morning from Nanmatou, Pudong, on the Beijing Maru of the Japanese Shanghal Ferry Company and the Zhangjiabang Maru of the Japanese Mitsubishi Company to the Gaomiao Ferry in Pudong, North Huangpu, and then boarded the Shangchuan railway to Chuansha for reinforcements. Shangchuan transportation was completely suspended yesterday due to the emergency situation, dedicated to military transport, so transportation between Shanghai and Chuanpu was cut off all day.

Pudong Border Disturbed Twice Yesterday

The area controlled by the Japanese Naval Landing Forces along the Pudong border is usually slightly more relaxed than the areas defended by the Japanese Army. Unexpectedly, at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, there was a sudden disturbance in broad daylight. It was rumored that a large number of guerrillas had infiltrated the area, intending to start an uprising. Over 200 Japanese Marines were dispatched at once, first temporarily blockading the Dongchang Road opposite the river, and announced martial law on land, stopping water and land transportation. Then they split up and searched the civilian houses in the Dongchang Road Police Station, Luzhuangjiazhai, Tiandudong, Yangjiazhai, and Xiyangjiazhai areas, overturning boxes and cabinets, with no one spared, for nearly three hours. It was not until 5:45 PM that the alert was lifted and traffic was opened. Passengers crossing the river from Pudong were temporarily blocked. It is heard that the Japanese troops searched in vain and found nothing. Also, the Yangjiadu area was also under martial law for one hour at 7:00 PM the night before last. Over 100 Chinese people were arrested and their collars were inspected, the purpose of which is unknown. As a result, over 40 people were detained and sent to the Lujiazui Brigade Headquarters. As of yesterday, they had not been released, and their whereabouts are unknown.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Prepares to Establish Maritime Affairs Management Agency; Shipu, Dinghai, Xiangshan, and Ninghai are Prohibited from Navigation, and Special Vessels are Not Allowed to Transport Dinghai Fishery Products

In order to standardize the construction of the administrative system and improve the water transportation organization, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to prepare for the establishment of a maritime affairs management agency, which will be solely responsible for handling maritime affairs administration and undertaking maritime construction, in line with the national policy of advancing the war of resistance and national construction simultaneously. The Ningbo Garrison Headquarters has issued an order to Dinghai and other counties stating that ships traveling to and from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Taiwan, the Feiyun River, and the Bie River are not allowed to dock at Shipu, Dinghai, Xiangshan, and Ninghai. In the future, inland navigation vessels in this area, except for Tianbaoli vessels, will not be allowed to dock at Dinghai, Shipu, Xiangshan, and Ninghai without approval. As for Dinghai's request to dispatch special vessels to transport fishery products, the Headquarters of the X Army Group has approved the rejection.

### Shipowner of the Aida Sends Telegram to Shanghai Expressing Suffering

Requests Prompt Negotiation for Release

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the gasoline ship Aida, owned by the Hungarian firm Kangmao Foreign Company, was carrying 1,000 empty diesel drums, 20 tons of coal, a drilling machine, 20 tons of iron sheets, and 40 passengers and sailors on behalf of its customers, departing from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 20th of last month. It was suddenly detained by the Japanese on the 22nd and forced to sail to the Xiamen waters, where it was monitored by the Japanese Navy in Xiamen. The Hungarian government protested to the Japanese side, requesting its prompt release. According to a telegram sent from Xiamen by Norwegian Stein, the shipowner of the Aida, to Shanghai, he reported to the Norwegian Consulate that he and the Chinese sailors were still on the ship in Xiamen and had lost their freedom, which caused him considerable suffering. He requested prompt negotiation.

According to the Continental Daily, the Norwegian Consulate in Shanghai previously sent a telegram to the Norwegian Vice-Consul in Xiamen to inquire about the situation of Stein, the captain of the Hungarian ship Ada. Yesterday (the 9th), a reply telegram was received stating only that Stein and his Chinese crew were ashore in Xiamen and had not lost their freedom. At the same time, it was heard that the Japanese naval authorities were continuing to investigate the identity of the ship.

### Guerrilla Areas Increase in Value of Legal Tender; Japanese and Puppet Plans to Undermine Legal Tender Ultimately Fail; Legal Tender in Tianjin and Peiping is as Smooth as Water

Since the implementation of our country's legal tender policy, in order to stabilize the exchange rate of the national currency, the government has ordered the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to maintain it at the statutory price. Although the legal tender in North China has been repeatedly planned and sabotaged by the Japanese puppets, it is still circulating smoothly, and its value is increasing. International commercial receipts and payments and the buying and selling of agricultural and industrial products are all conducted using legal tender. The details are as follows:

Circulation Volume of Legal Tender in North China

The total amount of legal tender circulating in the Tianjin and Peiping areas up to January 21st was 32,943,000 yuan, of which the Central Bank accounted for 3,648,000 yuan, the Bank of China accounted for 16,223,000 yuan, the Bank of Communications accounted for 7,850,000 yuan, the Hebei Provincial Bank accounted for 5,000,000 yuan, the China Land Reclamation Bank accounted for 90,000 yuan, the Four Banks accounted for 1,500,000 yuan, the China Industrial Bank accounted for 30,000 yuan, the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank accounted for 8,000 yuan, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank accounted for 20,000 yuan, and the Dazhong Bank accounted for 56,000 yuan. Due to the stability of its exchange rate and the solidity of its credit, most of this legal tender is held by the people in the embassy district of Peiping, the concession areas of Tianjin, and the inland villagers.

Japanese and Puppet Plans Ultimately Fail Since the puppet organization "United Reserve Bank of China" in Peiping issued banknotes, in order to absorb our legal tender and obtain foreign exchange, on June 10, 1938, it forcibly ordered our legal tender to cease circulation in Peiping, Tianjin, and other occupied urban areas. On August 8th of the same year, it limited the use of Tianjin banknotes issued by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications at a 10% discount, and it was heard that starting from February 20th of this year, this would be changed to a 40% discount, and from March 10th, there would be talk of stopping circulation altogether. However, in reality, the credit of our legal tender is solid, and international commercial receipts and payments can still maintain their original state. Our people exchange agricultural and industrial products for legal tender, which they carefully store, no different from hoarding money. As for counterfeit banknotes, they are paid out as soon as they are received. Therefore, the Japanese puppet scheme has not achieved anything in reality.

Legal Tender is "Watered" in Peiping and Tianjin

In the inland villages of North China, legal tender is still commonly used at face value. In the embassy area of Peiping and the concession area of Tianjin, not only is it not used at a discount, but the banknotes of the puppet organization "United Reserve Bank of China" are exchanged for the legal tender issued by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Tianjin, with an additional premium of 15 to 25 yuan per thousand yuan. In other words, 1,000 yuan of Tianjin banknotes issued by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is worth 1,015 to 1,025 yuan of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes. Therefore, in reality, the price of our legal tender compared to the "United Reserve Bank" banknotes has depreciated to 886 to 878, and it has never been heard that our legal tender is used at a 10% or 40% discount in the occupied areas. It can be seen that the price of our legal tender is as stable as before, and its credit is even more solid.

### Threatening Letters Received by Reporters Originate from Gambling Dens

According to the French-language Shanghai Daily on the 10th, it is heard that some foreign newspaper reporters in this city have recently received letters from a person named "Zhenshan Association," which are full of attacks on the "rumors" of various foreign newspapers and announce their death sentences. According to investigations by various foreign newspapers, these letters were sent from gambling dens in western Shanghai. Since the fall of Greater Shanghai, the area of western Shanghai has become a den of iniquity. The frequent criticisms by various foreign newspapers have deeply angered these people, so they intend to use threats to urge the reporters of various foreign newspapers to "reflect."

### After the Sinking of the Panama Merchant Ship Kai Bo, the Company Sends Personnel to Investigate; Two Russian Staff Members are Hired to Dive to the Bottom to See How the Ship's Hull is Damaged and to Provide Rescue

The Panama merchant ship Kai Bo, represented by the Norwegian firm Hualun Foreign Company, loaded a large quantity of white coal in Shanghai and sailed to Wenzhou. It suddenly struck a reef and sank in the northern waters off Wenzhou. All the rescued sailors have arrived in Shanghai and reported the sinking incident to the company. It is learned that the company, considering that the ship is of great value and its sinking would result in a considerable loss, has specifically requested the assistance of the Ma Le tugboat of Lai Si Foreign Company (Ma Le Company), carrying two Russian staff members who are familiar with navigation and good at diving. Under the command of the Russian tugboat owner Lai Beito Feisike, they will sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou this morning to inspect the sinking site of the Kai Bo and have the divers enter the sea to see the extent of the damage caused by the Kai Bo striking the reef, in order to take measures for rescue. It is noted that the white coal loaded by the Kai Bo this time was transported on behalf of the Ningbo Electric Power Company. The ship was built on the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom and is now 33 years old. It was previously operated by Norwegian merchants, but recently it was leased by Panama merchants.

### The Puppet "Municipal Government" Stops Collecting Consumption Tax, Merchants and Vendors are Further Oppressed; Puppet Government Officials Make Things Difficult in Every Way, and Benefiting the People Backfires

The puppet "Municipal Government" previously levied a "temporary consumption tax" because of its financial difficulties and exhausted resources. It did not hesitate to use exploitative means against the helpless people, arbitrarily exploiting them. Its oppressive policies were worse than tigers. It originally hoped to use this revenue to avoid the danger of collapse. Unexpectedly, the puppet officials under its jurisdiction committed all kinds of corruption, intercepting and embezzling taxes. Seventy or eighty percent of the taxes were pocketed without being reported or reimbursed. As a result, the amount of taxes actually paid was very small, and the finances of the puppet government remained exhausted and in dire straits, while the people had already been subjected to extraction and were suffering. The puppet "Mayor" recently ordered the cessation of this "temporary consumption tax" in the name of abolishing oppressive levies to show "benefit" to the people. However, the salaries of the puppet government officials were too low to support themselves. They had to create pretexts, commit corruption, and engage in private interests in order to cope with life. Therefore, since the "consumption tax" was stopped, these people lost the opportunity to collect money, and their financial resources were cut off. They were extremely angry, hating the puppet "Mayor" for seeking fame and reputation and oppressing the helpless people to vent their anger. As a result, ordinary farmers and vendors were subjected to unexpected difficulties. The transportation of goods was often prevented, and they were not allowed to cross the border. The losses they suffered were even greater than before. They lived in a state of dire suffering, all thanks to the puppet "Mayor."

### French Consul in Hankow Will Soon Take Office

According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, Mr. Renault, the former French Consul in Harbin, recently arrived in Shanghai with his wife. After staying for a few days, he will go to Hankow to take over the position of French Consul from Mr. Colin. Mr. Chuan Lai, Secretary and Translator of the French Embassy, came with Mr. Renault and will also go to Hankow.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Announces Restricted Goods Areas; Shanghai is Considered a Controlled Area, Including 43 Counties in Jiangsu and 14 Counties in Zhejiang

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations on the Prohibition of Transporting Goods to the Enemy promulgated by the National Government, stipulates that all domestic goods that may increase the enemy's strength are prohibited from being transported to the following areas: (1) enemy countries and their colonies or mandated territories; (2) places outside the areas mentioned in the preceding paragraph that have been violently controlled by the enemy. The aforementioned goods and the areas mentioned in the second paragraph shall be designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs from time to time.

### The Recent Assassination Cases Were Committed by the Same Group; Ballistics Experts at the Police Department Have Discovered Concrete Evidence

According to the Continental Daily, ballistics experts at the Shanghai Municipal Police have discovered concrete evidence proving that at least two of the four puppet officials killed this week were killed by the same assassination gang. The firearm used to assassinate Geng Shoubao, the head of the puppet detective team, on the morning of February 1st, was the same firearm used to kill Zhou Jitang, the director of the puppet "Jiangzhe Foil Tax Bureau," on the morning of Tuesday. Therefore, the police personnel believe that the assassination case was committed by a Chinese patriotic group to eliminate traitors and support the government. Subsequently, on Wednesday morning, Dong Qigao was assassinated at the Wujiaochang on Bailinan Road, and Mr. Qian was severely beaten. The police authorities now believe that all the cases were committed by the same group.

### The Japanese Have No Way to Justify the Detention of Foreign Ships; Reporters Ask Difficult Questions, and the Spokesman Says He is Extremely Annoyed by This

According to the Continental Daily, at a reception for reporters hosted by the Japanese yesterday (the 9th), the reporters questioned the spokesman about the detention of foreign ships by the Japanese or the "authorities" controlled by the Japanese, asking whether there was a disagreement between the Japanese government and the Japanese Navy. On Wednesday evening, when the Japanese Navy spokesman referred to investigating the "identity" of Jardine Matheson's Taishun and Mingshun ships, he said that Japan was currently at war with the Chiang Kai-shek government, and they wanted to

Fight to the End; the Collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek Government Can Accelerate the Relaxation of This Investigation Method. Yesterday evening, a reporter asked whether the spokesman's statement on Wednesday evening meant that any provision in international law that might prevent the Japanese army from defeating the Chiang Kai-shek government would be disregarded. The translator replied that the embassy spokesman did not believe that the Japanese government had this intention. The reporter asked about the Japanese Navy. The translator replied that what

Extremely Annoys Us is the reason for this. This answer aroused speculation among the reporters. The embassy spokesman reiterated that the Mingshun ship may have been released yesterday, but he had not received any further information on Wednesday's statement that the Mingshun and Taishun ships were detained in Yantai to investigate their "identity." A reporter asked whether the Japanese authorities intended to expand the

Three-Mile Limit recognized internationally by sealing off the Chinese coast. The spokesman replied that this was a matter to be considered. A reporter recalled the "Gentleman's Agreement" between Britain and Japan regarding the investigation of British-flagged ships and asked the spokesman whether one of the belligerent countries could intercept ships on the high seas if war had not already been declared. Another reporter asked the spokesman if he did not think that the Navy intended to overstep the agreement. The spokesman replied that he currently did not know "this situation" and that there would be any further expansion.

### The Issue of Jewish Refugees Coming to Shanghai; Consuls of Various Countries Report to Their Governments; Relief Organizations Have Exhausted Their Funds and are Trying to Discourage Continued Arrivals

Regarding the issue of Jewish refugees coming to Shanghai, Mr. Nairon, the Italian Consul General and senior Consul, sent a letter to the Chairman of the Municipal Council, stating in brief, "I have received your letters of December 23rd of last year and January 16th of this year, stating that a large number of Jewish refugees are pouring into Shanghai, creating a serious social problem. Please ask the consuls of various countries to take appropriate measures to prevent such refugees from entering the country again." This Consul General and other Consuls of various countries have paid close attention to this issue and agree to express their opinions to their respective governments, focusing on the current unfavorable situation in this city and explaining that these refugees have no way to make a living here. This Consul General and others have also reported to their respective governments that before the Jewish refugees came to Shanghai, the unemployment problem in this city was already serious, and the entry of these people has further increased the severity. Moreover, the funds of the relief organizations are almost exhausted and cannot be replenished. Therefore, we have strongly requested the governments of our respective countries to make the greatest possible use of various methods, such as propaganda in the press or posting notices at various ports, stations, and shipping companies, to advise these refugees not to come to Shanghai again. The severity of the current situation and the necessity of finding ways to improve it are well understood by the consuls of various countries.

### Saving Money from the Lunar New Year's Eve Feast and Transferring Funds to Relief Efforts

Initiated by Trade Associations

Citywide Implementation

During the Lunar New Year, all sectors are preparing for the New Year, and one of the necessary events is "eating the New Year's Eve dinner." After a year of hard work, as the seasons renew, having a big meal is originally a matter of reason and sentiment. However, at this extraordinary time, it seems that we should reduce spending. The Fundraising Committee of the Trade Association Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in view of this, unanimously resolved at a meeting yesterday to save on New Year's Eve dinners and transfer funds to relieve refugees, in order to embody the central government's goal of saving the country through frugality. The Association has already sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting it to notify all trade associations in the city to inform all trades to proceed together, and immediately send the expenses that should be paid for the New Year's Eve dinner to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association on Wuma Road, specifying it as savings from the New Year's Eve feast to show distinction and express enthusiasm, and hoping that all sectors will promote it together. In addition, the Hongchangxing Hardware Store on Beijing Road has sent 20 yuan saved at the end of the year to the Siming Bank on Nanjing Road for collection to be used for refugee relief.

Various Native Place Associations

Since the Native Place Association Group Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has actively promoted the organization of fundraising teams in various native place associations, the various native place associations have been established one after another, as has been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the Xianju Native Place Association has appointed Xu Changchuan, Xu Yunteng, Zhang Chulin, Fang Tixiong, etc., as team leaders to carry out fundraising donations. The Jixi County Native Place Association, due to its small scope, has appointed Hu Yuantang, Shao Shuwei, Cheng Kefan, etc., to join the Huining Native Place Team and cooperate together. In addition, the Taizhou Native Place Association appointed Luo Lianchen, and the Nantong Native Place Association appointed Sun Cangsou as the general team leaders to actively carry out fundraising work. In addition, the first batch of disaster relief piggy banks organized by the Native Place Association Group will be distributed starting on February 15th. There is still a need for a large number of fifty empty cigarette cans, and we sincerely hope that all sectors will donate them. They can be sent to the Association's office at No. 16 Longmen Road, or to the various native place associations and radio stations. If old goods merchants need to sell them for a price, they can also contact the Association.

One Day of Disaster Relief

The Citizens Group Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association is promoting the "One Day of Disaster Relief" movement among citizens. Since the plan has been approved and implemented by the Association, it is now actively preparing in accordance with the implementation methods. It is heard that in order to expand publicity and arouse the city's citizens to participate in unison, a citizens "One Day of Disaster Relief" broadcast publicity conference will be held from February 20th to 23rd (i.e., the second to fifth days of the Lunar New Year). In addition, it is planned to compile and print alerting slogans and request that each cinema add promotional films during screenings to promote attention from all sectors.

Salvation Army News

The Salvation Army's donations have already exceeded 23,000 yuan yesterday, including one person who donated 1,200 yuan. The situation is very enthusiastic. The Salvation Army hopes to reach 40,000 yuan in order to carry out relief work in the city, with 80% of it being used for Chinese people. The Salvation Army has set up a temporary headquarters at No. 57 Nanjing Road and hopes that donations can be sent directly there.

### After the Fire in the Civilian Village, Ways are Found to Provide Relief

The Cilian General Association and Other Organizations

Temporarily Distribute Rice Porridge, Clothing, and Bedding

The Civilian Village in the Western District of Xu Zhen Road, Xujiahui, was jointly organized by the civilians and Lu Shixi, the director of the Xuhui Reception Center of the Cilian Disaster Relief General Association, in July of last year. A total of two villages were established, north and south, all of which were thatched sheds. Unexpectedly, at about 10 p.m. on the 4th of this month, a civilian living at No. 329, North Village, was careless with fire. At that time, the northwest wind was raging, so the fire was out of control and spread to more than 200 blocks. Fortunately, the fire started early, so there were few deaths and injuries. It is estimated that two people died in the fire and two people fell into wells. There were about 3,000 victims, most of whom were coolies. These people were facing difficulties with food and shelter due to the fire. Chairman Huang of the Cilian Disaster Relief General Association sent personnel to join Father Zong, the director of the Xuhui Reception Center, to temporarily distribute rice porridge, clothing, and bread. The French Concession police provided assistance to the victims. It is heard that the Association is also planning for follow-up measures.

### The U.S. Naval Authorities Broadcast to Foreigners in Kuling, Asking About the Situation in the Mountains and Hoping to Contact the Navy Stationed in Jiujiang

The Japanese Side Agrees to Consider Postponing the Descent from the Mountains

According to the Continental Daily, the U.S. Naval Authorities in this city used news broadcasting as a medium last night to try to make contact with British and American expatriates in Kuling, because the British and American consuls and naval authorities in Jiujiang are currently unable to contact the Kuling expatriates. The broadcast was made by news reporter Alcott of Greater America Radio and stated that the consular staff in Jiujiang and the U.S. warship Waughu and the British warship Ladybird in Jiujiang were unable to communicate with Kuling. They are now waiting for the Kuling expatriates to report their intentions and hopes, and they earnestly stated that this decision to broadcast was not issuing an order, but only trying to ask the British and American expatriates in Kuling to make contact with their navy and consular staff in Jiujiang. In addition, according to news from the Jiujiang Tongmeng Society last night, British, American, and Japanese personnel will meet in Jiujiang today (the 10th) to discuss the withdrawal of third-country nationals. The withdrawal deadline set by the Japanese authorities will expire today, but they intend to extend the deadline for a few days before formally invading Kuling. The U.S. warship Waughu, carrying the British Vice-Consul McDermott and the U.S. Vice-Consul Davis stationed in Hankou, arrived in Jiujiang yesterday.

Also, it is reported that the authorities of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan have scheduled a meeting in Jiujiang yesterday to discuss the evacuation of foreigners from Kuling. The deadline for the Japanese to evacuate foreigners ended yesterday, but before they formally invaded Kuling, they still intended to extend the deadline for a few days. The British and American Vice-Consuls arrived in Jiujiang on the U.S. warship Waughu yesterday.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Report for January

(Continued)

(Workers' Living Standards) In January of this year, the cost of living index for workers in Shanghai was 159.32, an increase of 2.83 percent compared to December of last year, a decrease of 4.49 percent compared to January of last year, and an increase of 45.48 percent compared to 109.51 in July before the war. Compared to last month, 25 items increased, 19 items decreased, and 14 items remained the same. Except for clothing, all other category indexes increased. The most significant increase was in the rental category, followed by food and then miscellaneous items. Fuel prices were similar to last month, with only a 0.07 percent increase. The clothing category decreased by 2.52 percent compared to last month. The rising and falling trends of each category are briefly described as follows:

Food Category The price of rice rebounded this month. Japonica rice increased by more than half a yuan compared to last month, and Indica rice and glutinous rice increased by about one yuan. It was the beginning of the Gregorian New Year and the end of the lunar year, so demand was strong, and the weather turned cold, so goods became scarce. In addition, taxes and donations were too heavy, and the Japanese controlled the rice production in the guerrilla areas, and a large amount was shipped out, so the price of rice rose sharply. The inventory of flour was insufficient, and there was a lack of raw materials, so the market price rose. A large number of pigs and cattle arrived in Shanghai, and the price of meat fell slightly. The price of chicken increased as the end of the year approached and demand was strong. The supply of soybean oil was scarce, and sales were active, so the price also rebounded. The price of salt has been increasing steadily since control was implemented. The index for this category was 122.60, an increase of 3.28 percent compared to last month.

Rental Category Although there are changes in rental rates, there are rarely repeated increases and decreases in a year, so the changes are not as frequent as the ups and downs of commodity prices. Rental surveys are usually conducted once a year, but since the war began in August 1937, rents in Shanghai have increased rapidly and significantly, so the survey has been changed to twice a year. The first survey this year was held in January. Bungalows increased by 5.86 percent compared to the second half of 1938, Western-style buildings increased by 9.19 percent, and Shikumen buildings increased by 0.41 percent. The index for this month was 315.08, an increase of 4.48 percent compared to last month. (To be continued)

### The Changshu Fellow-Provincials Association: Implementing Restoration and Reorganization

Negotiating to Borrow a Communication Location

Beginning Fellow-Provincial Registration

The Changshu Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai had its activities suspended due to the war, with members scattered.

As the number of fellow-provincials in Shanghai has increased, a special meeting was convened to restore and reorganize the association. In addition to the original reorganization committee members being responsible for association affairs, and to ensure the smooth advancement of various projects for early realization, Qu Liangshi and over twenty others have been specially appointed as advisory committee members, and Yang Huarang and over fifty others as soliciting committee members.

### Xu Maochang’s Wife Commits Adultery: Police File Public Prosecution. The Adulterer’s Wife Refuses Forgiveness, Reports to the Police, and Requests Prosecution.

Vows in Court Never to Settle Mid-Way

Xu Maochang, a wealthy Ningbo businessman residing at No. 82 Tongfu Road, West Shanghai, in a self-built magnificent residence, began an affair with Jiang Yuzhen, a dancer from the Vienna dance hall, two years ago. After a lawsuit ensued, his wife, Ms. Qin, also, unwilling to remain alone in her boudoir, sought another lover to alleviate her dreary life. However, the woman is the beloved daughter of Qin Shanbao, a prominent figure in the Shanghai banking industry. The Qin family originally made its fortune in the dye business,

Possessing Assets of Millions. Almost all Heng-character banks in Shanghai have Qin's shares. Her marriage to Xu was considered a good match, so they were initially very harmonious after their wedding. Now, with the wife nearing thirty, and her husband having found another love, she followed suit. The object of her affection was Yang Jingqiang, a young man from Wuxi residing nearby at No. 8, Lane 102, Tongfu Road. Since meeting at the Dahua Ballroom in November of last year, they frequently took advantage of opportunities for secret rendezvous in various hotels, until the 7th of last month,

When the Secret Was Exposed, the Jing'an Temple police station, acting on Xu Maochang's report, dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to room 309 of the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road early that morning. They apprehended the illicit couple from their blankets. Both the man and woman confessed to the adultery without hesitation. Upon questioning, the police chief learned that they were individuals of means, so he spared them detention and ordered them to leave. He then, in accordance with Article 239 of the Criminal Code regarding adultery, filed a

Public Prosecution with the First Special District Court. On the first day of the court hearing, Xu Maochang requested that his wife's adultery not be pursued and asked to withdraw the charges, only prosecuting Yang Jingqiang. The court approved the request. At the second hearing, Xu stated that Yang had already repented and that he had forgiven him, requesting the police station to withdraw the charges against Yang. The court also approved this, so Ms. Qin and Yang, despite being summoned twice, did not appear in court for questioning. As far as Xu Maochang was concerned, the case was

Concluded. Unexpectedly, Yang Jingqiang's wife, Wang Minxia, found out. She initially noticed that her husband's attitude towards the family had been markedly different for the past month. She had repeatedly advised him, but Yang ignored her. Only recently did she fully understand the truth: Her husband had been seduced by Xu’s wife, Ms. Qin. With one being a married man and the other a married woman, their adultery was destroying another family, which was not permitted by law. Even if Xu

Was Willing to Forgive, the pain she suffered from her husband's affair was deep and great, and she could not condone it. However, since such cases fall under the scope of public prosecution according to the law, she retained attorney Jiang to report the matter to the police station, which was approved. She then filed a

Adultery Lawsuit against Yang Jingqiang and Xu’s wife Ms. Qin with the First Special Court. Upon receiving the complaint, the court specially summoned Yang's wife, Ms. Wang, to court yesterday through Presiding Judge Meng, informing her that Xu Maochang had previously filed a report on the case, which was accepted. However, Xu had requested a withdrawal. He informed her that criminal charges could not be dropped or reinstated freely. Yang’s wife Wang stated that she was determined to request the police station to investigate and prosecute the case and would never settle it mid-way. She made a pledge in court to demonstrate her determination. Presiding Judge Meng ordered her to leave and await a summons for questioning the defendant.

### Riots at the Ewo Cotton Mill

A sudden strike broke out at the British-owned Ewo Cotton Mill on Weituoma Road, Yangshupu, the day before yesterday. The Yangshupu police station learned of this and dispatched Western Inspector Hedden and Chinese detectives to investigate. They arrested over eighty workers on the spot for preventing other workers from going to work. The riot was quelled, and they were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, requested a special hearing at a later date, stating that the case involved a large number of people and that the police investigation was not yet complete. Presiding Judge Fang ordered the defendants to be held until next Wednesday afternoon for further hearing.

### Over a Dozen Strong Men Destroyed the West Shanghai Puppet Police Station. They Marched in Formation and Fired Over Ten Shots. The Windows and Doors of the Police Station Were Destroyed, and the Gambling Dens Were Warned.

Yesterday morning, around ten o'clock, over a dozen strong men, each carrying handguns, Mauser pistols, and a large number of leaflets, led by three young men in Western suits, first distributed propaganda from the Anti-Japanese Punish Traitors Corps near the Wujiaochang in Caojiadu. One of them fired a shot into the air, and passersby, hearing the sound, inquired and learned the details, whereupon they all echoed their sentiments.

Marched in Formation into the Puppet "Police Station". Then, the strong men marched in formation, shouting "Kill the traitors!" After a short time, they proceeded west along Great Western Road (Xisfei'er Road) to the former post office at No. 1362, the puppet "Caojiadu Police Sub-bureau." The men in Western suits led the charge, summoning the forty puppet police officers to the front of the station, declaring, "We Chinese don't fight Chinese! You don't need to be afraid!" Then, they threw a hand grenade into the building, but it did not explode. They then took out their weapons and opened fire, the sound of gunfire like a string of pearls, totaling dozens of shots, lasting for about five minutes. They also searched for the puppet "Police Chief" Wang Delin, but Wang was out. The puppet "Detective Squad Leader" Bao Ziying, being clever, had fled upon hearing the news. They then shouted slogans, destroying all the doors and windows of the bureau, and scattered leaflets from the "Chinese Youth Iron-Blood Punish Traitors Corps" inside before retreating. Before leaving, they gave the puppet police officers a very simple warning before calmly departing.

Two Gambling Dens Were Destroyed. Half an hour later, a group of strong men suddenly arrived at the entrance of the Deyun Gambling Den at No. 1214 Great Western Road (Xisfei'er Road). It was the morning gambling market, and gambling was at its peak. The gamblers, seeing the strong men carrying weapons with stern expressions, were greatly alarmed and fled in all directions like scattered birds and beasts. The strong men did not make things difficult for them, but only confiscated and tore up all the account books in the gambling den. All the gambling money in the cabinets was thrown outside. After about ten minutes, the mysterious team once again left singing loudly. The strong men then proceeded to the Yuwengji gambling den at No. 23 Xin Senli, where they dispersed the team, guarded the main roads, and prohibited gamblers from entering. They destroyed all the items, scattered leaflets, and then dispersed in the drizzling rain.

Concession Authorities Attach Great Importance to the Incident. Afterwards, the Japanese "puppet" authorities sent people to investigate the truth, but they did not know the whereabouts of the strong men. The Public Concession Police and the French Concession Police, considering the matter unprecedented, also sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations to make detailed reports. The Public Concession authorities have taken the recovered bullets for examination, finding that one of the bullets was the same as that used in the attack on the puppet "Detective Squad Leader" Geng Shoubao.

### Pawnshop Accepts Stolen Goods: Public Prosecution Filed

Han Choushan and Li Jincheng, Chinese detectives from the General Patrol Division, in their pursuit of the thief Chen Afu and others who specialized in stealing from major companies, discovered that the items stolen by Chen and his accomplices were mostly pawned at the Mingxing Pawnshop at No. 512 Tianjin Road. However, the pawnshop often did not issue pawn tickets. When the detectives went to retrieve the stolen goods, they did not bring the criminals or produce pawn tickets, but only notified the pawnshop to retrieve the stolen goods pawned by Chen and others. The next day, when they went to retrieve the items, the pawnshop had already taken out all the stolen goods pawned by Chen, without any errors. Therefore, the police determined that the pawnshop knew that the items received from Chen and others were stolen and that they were undoubtedly receiving stolen goods. They immediately filed a complaint against the pawnshop's clerk, Chen Qinghe. However, Chen died of illness before being summoned by the court. The police investigation now shows that the owner of the pawnshop, a Cantonese named Weng Liufu, was also involved in the matter and should be held criminally responsible. Therefore, Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department Legal Department, sued Weng in the First Special Court for the crime of receiving stolen goods under Article 349 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday, Presiding Judge Fang Qinghuan opened the Fourth Criminal Court to question him. Weng completely denied all the charges brought by the police, but the detectives testified that the pawnshop did have the practice of not issuing pawn tickets when receiving pawned items, because Chen Afu did not have a pawn ticket on him when he was arrested. Presiding Judge Fang reviewed the testimonies and ordered the case to be rescheduled for a hearing in one week.

### An Old Woman's Life-Saving Funds: Gamble All In One Throw. A Concubine, Enraged, Takes Her Own Life. The Actions of Huang Sanlin Deserve No Forgiveness. A Lawyer, Taking Pity, Helps the Old Woman Return Home.

Chen Mao's, an old woman from Shaoxing, aged sixty-four, had lived at No. 68 Xin Zha Bridge Road for many years. Recently, due to owing seven months' rent, the landlord sued her in court, and a judgment was made, and her property had been sealed. As a result, she had nowhere to live and was sleeping in alleyways, in a very miserable state. She had a relative, Zhao Laosan, who was living with Pan Sanlin, a man from Pudong, in a concubine relationship at No. 16, Lane 161, Xiamen Road. She was forced to take temporary residence at Pan's home. Later, a lawyer named Shen intervened with the landlord on behalf of Chen Mao's. As a result, the landlord agreed to give her eighty yuan to

Sustain Her Life. On the sixth of the month, the money was delivered to lawyer Shen's office, and Shen notified her to collect it. That afternoon at 5 p.m., she accompanied Pan Sanlin to lawyer Shen's office to receive the eighty yuan. Afterwards, Pan told her that there were many bandits nowadays, and that since she was old, carrying a large sum of money could be dangerous. He proposed that she hire a vehicle and go home first, while he would bring the money back later. She agreed. Unexpectedly, after taking the money, Pan left and never returned. Despite searching, there was no trace of him. It wasn't until the ninth that she learned that Pan had, after obtaining the money, gone to the

Gambling Dens in the Caojiadu area of West Shanghai for a Frenzied Gamble, losing all eighty yuan. Not enough, he even pawned his long gown to continue gambling, losing that as well. Having no money to go home, he hid at his brother's home at No. 8, Lane 265, Yunnan Road. Chen Mao's, upon hearing this news, felt that her life depended entirely on the eighty yuan, and that now that Pan had squandered it all, she would either freeze to death or starve to death. She thought of throwing herself into the Huangpu River, but felt that if Pan's actions were not punished, she would not be satisfied. She then went to the Xin Zha police station to report the incident. Pan Sanlin's concubine, Zhao Laosan, feeling she had no face to see Chen Mao’s because her husband had

Cut Off Her Means of Survival, her old ailment of phlegm wheezing suddenly worsened and reoccurred. At 5 p.m. she was unable to breathe and died. Subsequently, Pang Jinshan, a Chinese detective from the Xin Zha police station, arrested Pan and sent him to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him for embezzlement under the criminal law, stating that the plaintiff Chen Mao's was now homeless and should be sent to a refugee shelter to avoid starvation and cold. He requested the court to

Severely Punish Pan according to the law. When questioned, Pan Sanlin claimed that the money was voluntarily lent to him by Chen, but she denied this. Presiding Judge Zhan Liangce confirmed the truth after questioning. He sentenced Pan Sanlin to six months imprisonment as a warning. Chen Mao's, feeling that being stranded in Shanghai was not a long-term solution, decided to return to her hometown of Shaoxing. Lawyers Qian Xunji, Jiang Chiping, and Wu Chenliang, a reporter who happened to be in the courtroom, each gave her five yuan as

Travel Expenses to Return Home. He also had Pang Jinshan, the Chinese detective in charge of the case, purchase a boat ticket for her, to prevent her from being deceived again, like Pan Sanlin. Because he was addicted to gambling, he disregarded everything, losing the money that others depended on for survival, causing his concubine Zhao Laosan to die of anger, and almost causing Chen Mao's to throw herself into the Huangpu River. His actions truly deserved no forgiveness.

### Year-End Pressures Tighten: Huizhong Bank Adjusts Industry and Commerce

Established Nine Years, Capital of 200,000 Yuan, Self-Built Building, Conducting Transactional Deposits

The Huizhong Bank at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road in Shanghai, with its nine years of long-standing history, adhering to its consistent spirit of service, has seen its business grow day by day, and its public reserves become increasingly strong. Since the completion and opening of the Huizhong Building on Shilu and Er Ma Road, its social reputation has become even more prestigious. Recently, in view of the approaching year-end and in order to thoroughly adjust industry and commerce and facilitate the settlement of accounts and turnover for all sectors, it has specially opened a

Special Transactional Account. Any legitimate merchant, without the need for an introduction, can open an account, and the initial deposit only requires 200 yuan in national currency. Subsequently, regardless of the amount, they can deposit and withdraw as needed, with a minimum balance of five yuan. Using checks provides flexible turnover, with procedures that are extremely convenient and save the trouble of counting cash. During the opening period of the Shilu branch, in addition to adding 1% interest, giving interest at 6%, each account will also receive a leather wallet or calligraphic couplet by a famous artist worth five yuan, as a special offer. To better serve small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises, it has pioneered a 50 yuan

Ordinary Transactional Account. With small capital, using checks, they can achieve appropriate allocation, enabling them to cope with ease. Nothing could be more beneficial! As the end of the year is approaching, in order to save unnecessary expenses and eliminate wasteful gifts, they also offer

Current Deposits. From one yuan to one thousand yuan, accounts can be opened. They can be deposited and withdrawn at any time, enjoy regular interest, and receive a leather wallet. Fixed deposits are extremely secure, and the interest is even more generous. As for the

Fairness of Remittances and Discounting, and the Accuracy of Buying and Selling Banknotes, it has long been established. Other matters, such as weekend office hours, are merely ancillary.

### British Ship Alexandria Encountered Pirates at Yanglinkou: Six Dead and Wounded Discovered. A Tugboat Sank in the Panic, But the Ship Was Not Boarded by Pirates for Robbery.

The British ship Alexandria, owned by the British company Jardine, Matheson & Co., encountered pirates near Yanglinkou at 4:30 a.m. yesterday, resulting in five injured passengers and the sinking of a tugboat, with one crew member dead. The details are as follows:

Attacked by Pirate Ships. The Alexandria, owned by Jardine Matheson & Co., managed by a foreign shipping company, was sailing the route between Xingang, Changyinsha, and Hupu. It departed from Shanghai at 11 p.m. on the ninth of this month. At 4:30 a.m. yesterday, while passing through the Yanglinkou waters, it suddenly encountered over ten pirate ships, lined up in a row, ordering it to stop. The captain, knowing that he had encountered pirates, increased speed to escape and was not boarded by the bandits for robbery.

Tugboat Sank. The ship was shot at by the pirate ships, resulting in five injured passengers. The ship was towing a tugboat, which sank in the panic. Eleven people fell into the water, but were all rescued, except for one who died. It is not yet clear what other difficulties the ship encountered. The loss of goods is likely to be considerable. The five injured passengers were taken to Shanghai for treatment on the Lu'an, a ship from the Chinese Maritime Customs Service. The Alexandria is scheduled to return to Shanghai at 3 p.m. tomorrow (the 11th).

Five Injured. The British ship Alexandria was robbed by pirates near the Wusongkou yesterday morning. Many shots were fired, and five people were injured. The injured were transferred to another ship and arrived in Shanghai at 3:30 p.m., where they were taken to Renji Hospital in ambulances summoned by the Chinese police. The names of the injured are as follows: Lin Fuwu, 26 years old, injured left hand; Liang Shangjun, 25 years old, injured left hand; Wang Baoan, 18 years old, injured right foot; Shi Jinquan, 25 years old, injured back; Dong Fengsheng, 26 years old, injured nose. It is said that Shi Jinquan and Dong Fengsheng were severely injured and may be in danger of death.

Reported in Western Newspaper. According to the English-language North China Daily News, the British company Jardine Matheson’s ship Alexandria encountered pirates in the Yangtze River this morning (the 10th), injuring five passengers. Over ten other passengers, fearing that the pirates would fire machine guns, jumped into the river, tragically drowning. The captain of the ship is named Yin Shu, and there were a total of 600 passengers. As the ship's radio was damaged, details were not known. The Alexandria set sail from Shanghai early this morning to the Yangtze River, stopping along the way to allow passengers to disembark. When it arrived at Yanglinkou, 20 miles upstream from Wusong, it suddenly encountered a pirate ship parked there, which opened fire on the Alexandria. The ship accelerated and managed to escape, but five passengers were hit and injured. They were first bandaged and then met the German ship Lu'an, which was sailing to Shanghai. They hailed the ship and transferred the five injured passengers to that ship, and then each sailed their separate ways. The Lu'an then sent a brief wireless message to Jardine Matheson & Co., instructing them to notify the rescue operation at Pier 4 on the Bund at 3:30 p.m., so that the injured could be sent to the hospital when the ship arrived. The Alexandria has recently begun operating a passenger business, sailing between Shanghai and Jiangyin Shuizha.

### Xu Shaoxuan, Owner of Tongmao Salt Store, Is Blackmailed. Students, Driven by Livelihood, Sent a Letter Demanding Money, Arrested, Sentenced to Four Months.

Xu Shaoxuan, owner of the Tongmao Salt Store at No. 186 Liaoyang Road, Hongkou, received four threatening letters from a criminal gang starting on the 4th of this month, intending to extort 400 yuan in legal tender. They specified that 40 bills of 10 yuan each should be wrapped in paper and placed on the grass by a certain lane entrance on Huishan Road, and someone would come to retrieve them. They threatened to shoot if he appeared with a gun. After receiving the letter, Xu reported it to the Yulin Road police station. They dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to Huishan Road around 7 p.m. the day before yesterday to wait. They placed a paper package on the grass. Before long, a local named Yao Shubao (19 years old, residing at No. 645 Huishan Road) came to pick up the paper package. They arrested him and detained him at the police station. Yesterday morning, they sent him to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted him for attempted extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Code, and described the circumstances of the arrest. When questioned, the defendant Yao Shubao confessed that he used to study at the Donghai Middle School in Hongkou, but dropped out of school after the war. Due to being in debt, he was forced to resort to this measure. He directly admitted to writing the threatening letters. Presiding Judge Xiao ruled in court that Yao Shubao, intending to unlawfully obtain property for himself, attempted to make others hand over property, and sentenced him to four months imprisonment. The threatening letters were confiscated.

### Document Agency Encroaching on Litigation: Main Culprit Apprehended, Police Lawyer Requests Severe Punishment, Pending Retrieval of Documents for Further Review

Xu Jun, also known as Zhenya, from Changzhou, established the so-called Huayang Document Agency at No. 108, Mendeland Road, in 1936. He advertised that he specialized in writing lawsuits for others and collecting debts. The First Special District Court found that Xu's behavior constituted encroaching on litigation and sent a document to the Chengdu Road Police Station, ordering them to ban it. The police went to the agency and seized a lot of evidence. They filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court. Xu Jun evaded court summons. The court issued an arrest warrant. He had not been captured until recently. The Chengdu Road Police Station received a tip that Xu had returned to Shanghai under the alias Zhang Zhifeng. He had created the slippery business of the Dadong Trust at No. 10, Fuyuan Lane, Baike Road. The police should arrest him. Hua Detective Zhang Kuilian went the day before yesterday and arrested Xu and brought him back to the police station. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the previous situation and filed a lawsuit according to Article 157 of the Criminal Law, requesting severe punishment according to law. When questioned, Xu Jun denied establishing the Huayang Document Agency, but claimed that the matter of writing lawsuits was handled entirely by a person named Xu He. Judge Zhan Liangce reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, postponed for one week, pending retrieval of the case file for further interrogation.

### Pedestrian Crushed to Death by Car

Zhang Longhai, a Chongming native, 30 years old, working at No. 16, Luban Road in the French Concession, was walking through the intersection of Julai Road and Notre Dame Road on the afternoon of the 7th of this month, heading from east to west. A French public bus No. F857 on Route 22 was driving from south to north on Notre Dame Road. Unable to avoid it, he was knocked down and his left foot was crushed. A patrolman saw it, recorded the bus number, and sent Zhang to Guangci Hospital. He also reported to the police station. Zhang died in the hospital at 3:30 PM on the 10th due to worsening injuries. The hospital notified the police station. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan branch mortuary, awaiting the Second Special District Court to send someone to examine it today.

### Nearsightedness Mistakenly Enters Neighbor's Home, Staging a Humorous Play: Mistaking the Front Lane for the Back Lane, Striding Straight In, and Mistaking the Neighbor's Wife for His Own, Utterly Absurd, He Ruisheng Suffers a Beating and is Sent to the Hospital

He Ruisheng, a Ningbo native, 41 years old, lives on the third floor of No. 373, Hong'an Lane, Haining Road. He is the maternal uncle of Sun Cui'e, who sings Ningbo ballads on the Tianyun Tower of the Wing On Company. However, He suffers from nearsightedness, so his residence is often filled with laughter and jokes, making people burst into laughter. Unexpectedly, He staged another humorous play yesterday morning, and was beaten. At that time, He had just returned home from shopping outside. When he arrived at Hong'an Lane, because the house styles were similar, he mistakenly entered No. 341 in the front lane. He went straight up to the third floor and pushed open the door of a bedroom that seemed familiar. As he stepped into the room, because the furnishings in the room were similar to those in his real bedroom, He never realized that he had mistakenly entered his neighbor's room. At that moment, there was a woman sleeping soundly in the bed in the room. He mistakenly thought it was his wife who had not gotten up. He reached into the quilt and groped her, trying to wake her up. The woman suddenly felt someone pushing her while she was sleeping. She opened her eyes and saw an uninvited man leaning over the bed, muttering something in his mouth. She was shocked and screamed "Rape!" At this time, He realized that the woman's voice was not like his wife's. He woke up as if from a dream and turned around and ran away. Unexpectedly, the woman chased him out. When He ran to the staircase on the third floor, he was kicked down the stairs by the woman. At the same time, the neighbors downstairs also rushed over upon hearing the noise. Without asking why, they punched and kicked him, causing He to be severely injured. His pair of nearsighted eyes, the source of the trouble, were also swollen like steamed buns. Afterwards, the police arrived and sent He to Tongren Hospital for treatment. This humorous play came to an end. The reporter recalled two lines of poetry satirizing nearsightedness: "Because the book box is locked, the eyebrows are broken" and "Blowing out the lamp burns the lip skin." The humorous play performed by He Ruisheng is not without reason.

### Japanese Warships Loading Red Sandalwood Furniture in Nanshi

Starting at 8:00 AM, they were transported in batches to Yangshupu and unloaded onto Japanese transport ships to be shipped back to Japan. A total of three batches were transported until 4:00 PM. It is estimated that the total value is tens of thousands of gold, a true catastrophe.

Later, due to audience requests, it was re-performed once. Although there were no empty seats and every show was full, many people still missed out. Therefore, it was decided to re-perform it again.

### Securities: Year-End Approaching, Domestic Debt Coming Again with a Surge, What is the Purpose of Peace Talks, Unified B Shares Alone Rise by 1.30 Yuan, Unified A Shares Fall After Drawing Lots, British and German Gains Remain Unrestrained

Securities Over-the-Counter Trading: Yesterday's market conditions were, in the waning trading season, suddenly enlivened by a foreign dispatch reporting on the Chongqing government's observations on the current situation, revealing a considerable atmosphere of peace. However, the position and responsibility of the speaker were quite questionable, raising doubts about a hidden agenda or misrepresentation. Nevertheless, the public bond market was sufficiently excited by this news, stirring some life into the long-dormant market. However, the tense situation in France and Italy had reached the point of an impending storm, with complexities that could not be altered by individual remarks alone. The unified determination of the anti-Japanese front, consistent from top to bottom, was exploited by speculators as a temporary stimulant. Regarding new US loans to China, according to Jones's remarks, there was no immediate prospect of agreement. However, people's hopes turned to the news of British and American loans, with optimists believing in a bright future.

Yesterday's Overview: At the opening bell, all the trading houses showed excellent momentum. Xinfeng, Yongrunli, Yongkang, and other firms actively bought in, and retail absorption was also quite lively. Only Tongkang firm sold off slightly. The market price then surged due to the supply-demand imbalance. A shares uniquely showed a varied market price when calculated net of the lottery drawing. B shares, being the seventh drawing and due on March 10, increased from five to nine available lots. Therefore, its rise was particularly remarkable, soaring one yuan in the morning as the highest single gain. Afternoon trading was slightly inferior, but market sentiment remained quite firm and bullish. Fifteen-numbered shares suddenly showed eagerness to enter the market. Yongkang and Runli firms added to their long positions. Dafeng also had considerable intake. Tongkang continued to sell off. Five-numbered shares also sold out. Market sentiment remained quite firm, improving another one or two points. The final result of the day's market price, except for A shares, which lost 0.85 yuan due to the lottery drawing rights calculations, saw gains of between 0.60 yuan and 0.85 yuan on all other shares. B shares uniquely surged 1.30 yuan. The total transaction volume exceeded 600,000 yuan. A summary table is provided below:

Stock Trading: There were 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Stock traded at a price of 6.55 yuan. There were no other transactions.

London Chinese Foreign Debt: The listing prices on Thursday, the 9th of this month, continued to rise. British and German Reorganization Loans and British-issued bonds continued to rise by one pound, priced at 73 pounds. British Gold Consolidation Bonds, British-issued bonds, and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bonds also continued to rise by half a pound. The former was priced at 49 pounds, and the latter was priced at 20 pounds. All others remained unchanged. The market price of French-issued and printed British Gold Consolidation Bonds also rose accordingly, with the buying price currently at 47 pounds and the selling price at 48 pounds. London's supply of spot goods has been somewhat subdued since the market price rose. A total of 2,000 pounds of British Gold Consolidation Bonds (British-issued bonds) were sold at 50 pounds. One thousand pounds (equivalent to 5,000 US dollars) of non-printed Sino-French-American 5% Bonds were sold at 67.5 pounds.

### Finance: Exchange Rates Tighten Then Level Out, Foreign Firms Buy and Hong Kong Sell

Yesterday's foreign exchange market was characterized by continuing heavy foreign firm settlements and a few Maxwell settlements, coupled with a sluggish selling intention by foreign banks, but good intake, leading to continued underlying tightness. British gold once briefly touched 8 pence at 1.40625, and the US exchange rate also briefly touched 15.90625 yuan. Fortunately, the frequent selling by Hong Kong Telegraph and the Chinese banks gradually leveled out the rates. Trading was especially smooth. Hong Kong exchange rates were slightly tight and soft because various foreign banks had strong appetite and money exchanges had no intention to resell, so although Chinese banks also tried to release, the position ultimately bought more than sold.

In the early morning, London large bars both near and far rose 1.25, New York spot was still level, London raw gold decreased 0.5 pence, exchange rates were up 1.9 centimes against the US, up 4 centimes against France, and level against Shanghai. The US was up 0.25 against England, up 1.25 against France, and up a small 0.05 against Shanghai. Central bank rates remained firm, so banks opened the selling prices early, British exchange 8 pence 1.71875, US exchange 15.96875 yuan, level with the previous close for British exchange, and eased 0.03125 for US exchange. After the opening, foreign firms first bought settlements, Netherlands American Bank buying US exchange at 15.96875 and 15.9375, so underlying momentum tightened. HSBC rates were announced unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to rise 0.75, calculated at 6.25 percent. Thereafter, foreign firms again bought into HSBC, gaining British gold 8 pence 1.71875 and 1.5625. Later, British gold was at its weakest, even touching 8 pence 1.40625, and US exchange was also at its tightest, even touching 15.90625 yuan. At midday, Hong Kong Telegraph suddenly released, selling British gold 8 pence 1.71875 to Mercantile, and selling US exchange 15.96875 yuan to Sino-Belgian. Afterwards, money exchanges also sold Hong Kong exchange at 54.50 yuan and 54.75 to Hua Yi Netherlands Amdha, gradually leveling out the situation. In the afternoon, banks listed prices for British gold at 8 pence 1.5625, US exchange at 15.9375.

In the later market, Chinese banks first sold British gold 8 pence 1.5625 to favorable parties, and also sold US exchange 15.9375 to American banks, making underlying momentum quite level. Finally, foreign telegrams also sold British gold 8 pence 1.71875 to Sino-Belgian Mercantile American Bank. Subsequently, Chinese banks also sold Hong Kong exchange at 54.50 yuan and 54.625 to Hua Yi, so underlying momentum remained level. The bank closed late with selling prices of British exchange at 8 pence 1.71875, and US exchange at 15.9375 yuan. As a result, British and US exchange rates were neither up nor down compared to the previous close. Hong Kong exchange was slightly tighter by 0.125.

### Cash Prices Rise and Fall Very Slightly

Yesterday's cash silver dollar over-the-counter market conditions still saw a narrow range of fluctuation. The overall situation for the day was that prices first rose and then fell. Initially, the tight foreign exchange rates caused a buying frenzy, and the enthusiastic procurement by a certain silversmith on behalf of a wealthy local pushed the price to the 2050 yuan mark. Later, as foreign exchange rates gradually leveled out, silversmiths and money changers successively sold off, and buyers became scarce, gradually reversing the market. The result was an increase of 3 yuan. All sides were very stable, and trading was flat. The silver shops' jewelry prices remained unchanged. Sea Customs Gold and Sino-British Pure Gold both fell slightly.

Silver Dollar Over-the-Counter Gained 3 Yuan

From the beginning of the morning, the seller quoted 2045 yuan per bar (ten taels), and buyers countered with a purchase price of 2041 or 2042 yuan. The standoff lasted until after ten o'clock, when silversmiths bought fifty taels from money changers at a price of 2043 yuan, which was the opening price. At the same price, a cash shop sold fifty taels to a money changer. Thereafter, due to foreign firms scrambling for settlements, foreign exchange rates gradually tightened, stimulating market sentiment, in addition to the sudden heavy buying by a silversmith on behalf of a wealthy local, the market price rose step by step. A certain silversmith bought fifty taels from a fellow trader and fifty taels from money changers, both at 2046 yuan. Subsequently, money changers traded fifty taels amongst themselves at 2048 yuan. Later, Northern firms bought fifty taels from the silversmiths at 2050 yuan. The silversmiths sold ten taels to money changers at 2048 yuan. Finally, money changers traded twenty taels amongst themselves at 2048.50 yuan, which was the midday close price. The afternoon was rather quiet. At 2:40, silversmiths first sold fifty taels to money changers at 2048 yuan. Later, silversmiths traded fifty taels amongst themselves at 2047 yuan. Thereafter, supply and demand were even scarcer and prices remained steady, until at 3:45, money changers traded fifty taels amongst themselves at 2048 yuan, which was the late close price, gaining 3 yuan compared to the previous day. The cash shop's listed selling price for silver was 2055 yuan, and the purchasing price was 2040 yuan. The current bid price was 50 yuan lower than the listed price for silver, but there were no transactions.

Jewelry Prices Remained Unchanged

The exchange price for silversmith jewelry remained unchanged. Datongxing, Lao Qingyun, and others still held the original price of 207 yuan. New Tongxing held 205 yuan, and the purchasing price was 199 yuan.

British Pure Gold Fell by Half a Pence

According to a London dispatch on the 9th, British pure gold fell by half a pence per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 3.5 pence. The Central Bank's Chinese cash purchase price also fell to 1210.60 yuan, and the listed customs gold also fell by 0.02, calculated at 2.392 yuan. The Shanghai standard bid price also fell by 0.3 yuan, calculated at 1205.9 yuan.

### Hainan Island War; Foreign Currencies See Slight Increase

Yesterday, the British pound sterling fell by half a penny, the British-American exchange rate rose by twenty-five, foreign exchange firms had substantial settlement needs, bank supply was not smooth, and with the Japanese army landing on Hainan Island, public sentiment was panicked, selling interest was weak, and market prices trended weakly, with a soft closing. Retail investors eagerly traded, and gold shops and silver shops had good absorption. Market price fluctuations were limited, and the trend showed sideways movement. Major players were watching and waiting for an opportunity, fearing no major changes within the coming years. Foreign currencies saw a slight increase in market prices due to the weakness of drafts. Most remained unchanged. Over-the-counter transactions were not numerous, and public association transactions were also few. Only Xiangtai sold and Xiangkang bought US dollar drafts of one thousand yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose by one dime, British gold drafts rose by one dime, US dollar drafts rose by two and a half cents, Hong Kong dollar drafts rose by six li, French franc drafts rose by half a li, ruble drafts rose by two cents, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Big Silver Bar Gains; Indian Silver Recedes

London, 9th – While India bought silver, some also covered short positions. However, supply was still abundant, so the market was stable. After closing, it turned sluggish, and some offered to sell at the bid price. Big silver bars for both near and far terms gained 1.25. New York silver report: US silver prices remained fixed and unchanged. Also, Bombay silver report: Indian silver was stable; spot and February both receded by two annas, while March remained unchanged.

### Discount Rate Unchanged

But entry and exit must differ by two and a half dimes. Yesterday's discount rate for remittance and draft bills remained firmly unchanged, consistently at 35 yuan per thousand, the same as the previous day's price, but entry and exit must be at a price difference of two and a half dimes, it is said.

### Silk and Tea – Silk Prices Still High; Creating an Opportunity for Artificial Silk

For over ten days, domestic and international silk prices have risen almost daily, boosting confidence. Yesterday, in the New York market, daily Shanghai silk prices continued to rise by two cents. However, the exchange market saw a reactionary decline, with near-term prices down by one cent and far-term prices down by three cents. The Yokohama market also followed, down by over ten yuan. By the afternoon closing, prices rebounded, with spot prices closing at 935 yuan and far-term prices at 908 yuan. Sales to the US and France from Shanghai are currently difficult to improve because manufacturers are holding prices too high. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson imported 50 dan of 7-8 grade silk at a price of 1,525 yuan, an increase of over 40 yuan from the previous settled price. Prices from French firms are still difficult to approach. Indian firms have recently shown renewed activity due to strong demand from Bombay silk mills. Silk merchants from that city are wholesale purchasing, absorbing various local silks at increased prices. Prices for each surged by around 90 yuan. Reeled silk, after fierce price increases, approached the 1,000 yuan mark, and even ordinary medium-grade silk reached 870-880 yuan, with a total of 120 dan transacted, leading to market enthusiasm. However, some foreigners are looting a large quantity of silkworm cocoons from various regions, and the high price of silk is creating an opportunity for them, which is also worth noting.

### Grains – Australian Flour Arrives in Shanghai; Local Flour Slightly Affected; Wheat Market Looks to the New Year

The flour market continues to show a firm trend. In terms of sales to customers, there are still sporadic shipments to the Nanyang group. The Beiyang group is using local foreign flour to fill orders, but sales have not yet improved. Demand for by-product flour is still strong, but factories have previously opened up 20,000-30,000 bags, and current supply is feeling the lack, so the market is unlikely to be prosperous. Total daily transactions are estimated at over 20,000 bags. Apart from the Nanyang group adding 10,000 bags for Fuzhou and Shantou, local and Hebei-Shandong group sales are limited. Moreover, it is heard that a new order of 2,000 tons of Australian foreign flour has arrived in Shanghai. Those who need high-quality white flour are actively purchasing foreign flour, slightly affecting local flour sales. However, the overall market is likely to wait until next year. The price of flour from the No. 2 Flour Mill remains at 4.8 yuan, and it may remain stable until the new year, it is said.

The wheat market is constantly quiet. Daily arrivals are scarce, and factory demand is also very quiet. Both buyers and sellers are mostly preparing to close out positions due to the approaching Lunar New Year. Therefore, merchants' minds are consistently optimistic and sticking to high prices, so the asking price has increased without decrease. The Tongshi Fufeng Factory has also announced a temporary shutdown, only opening up Jiangbei high-grade wheat, amounting to 300 bags, at a price of 6.65 yuan, purchased by Fuxin Factory.

### 客秈 Price High, Sales Stagnant; Thick and Thin 粳 Also Fall by a Dime; Wuhu Machine Rice Cuts Small by Two Dimes

Over 2,000 bags of Ke Xian arrived yesterday by train, along with nearly 1,000 bags of Wuhu Machine Rice. However, the local stores had been actively selling 茶濃 (tea-infused rice) for days, and as their inventory was largely replenished, they were hesitant due to the high prices, resulting in less than 2,000 bags of 京 (Nanjing) and 蕪 (Wuhu) Xian rice being transacted. Prices also fell slightly. Nanjing Xian was priced at 11.23 yuan, and Wuhu Xian at 10.079 yuan, varying depending on the quality. Wuhu 元米 (Yuan rice) arrived last month when 變陰元 (changing-Yuan rice) was discontinued, and was well-received. Recently, as the price of 高變元 (high changing-Yuan rice) surged to 15 yuan, merchants rushed to transport a thousand bags to Shanghai. However, as the supply of 變陰元 (changing-Yuan rice) resumed, the market had already stabilized. As a result, Wuhu Yuan rice was immediately cut by two dimes, with a price of 13.6 yuan.

Yesterday, the source of 河下 (He Xia) 杜米 (Du rice) was still only No. 2, with 2,000-3,000 bags arriving by train. The local sales market, after continuous active sales in the past few days, has turned sluggish as the end of the year approaches. Meanwhile, store owners are mostly considering holding stock over the New Year, and have ceased operations. However, sellers with large quantities of goods are eager to sell them off, and have no choice but to lower prices. The situation has turned weak, and the market has softened. Prices for thick and thin 粳 (Jing rice) have fallen slightly by a few cents to one dime. 杜 (Du) 洋尖 (Yang Jian rice) and 埠尖 (Bu Jian rice) have also depreciated by a few cents. The supply of 變元 (changing-Yuan rice) goods is scarce, and they can be expected to hold steady at any time, without honor or disgrace.

### Yarn and Cotton – A Certain Factory in North China Plans to Purchase Foreign Cotton in Shanghai; Transactions of 火機花 (Fire Engine Flower Cotton) Still Occur

Foreign Cotton Prices: The New York cotton market still shows no improvement. Recently, due to poor cloth sales, factories are also afraid that cotton prices will fall in the near future, so they are closing out spot and near-term transactions, which has greatly affected the cotton market. The southern merchants are also short selling in the market, resulting in a drop of seven or eight pounds in the near term and a drop of one pound in the far term. Yesterday, Senator Smith of Washington suggested that the government extract 1.5 million bales of American cotton from the loan cotton warehouses each year to compensate those willing to voluntarily reduce cotton fields, but this proposal was opposed by the public and not passed. Yesterday, the Indian prompt forecast also fell by more than one rupee, and the Egyptian fell by three or four pounds. Although exchange rates rose yesterday, the converted legal tender cotton prices still fell, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton falling by five dimes, Indian cotton falling by six dimes, and Egyptian cotton falling by eight dimes.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: All factories are preparing to close their books and quietly spend the end of the year as the Lunar New Year is approaching. Regarding the purchase of foreign cotton, except for slight transactions of cheap goods with particularly low prices, everything is silent. Yesterday, only Anda Factory purchased 100 bales of Indian cotton at a price of 70 yuan, which was very cheap. A certain factory in North China plans to purchase foreign cotton in Shanghai, but has not yet completed the transaction due to unresolved issues such as payment and delivery. The cotton prices for yesterday are recorded below.

Local cotton business is becoming increasingly quiet, and all parties have completely stopped. However, Zhenhua Factory occasionally imports 火機花 (Fire Engine Flower Cotton), but the amount is very small. The market is waiting for the development of the New Year in the coming spring, but the sources from all routes are also very scarce, so market prices remain firm and high. A large number of Indian and American cotton ordered by various Chinese and foreign factories will arrive this year. There are 300 bales of Tonghua cotton arriving at the wharf, 210 pieces from Xingang, 350 pieces from Beisha, and 160 pieces from Baimao. The current cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left.

### Spot Yarn Sales Weak; Double Horse Approaches the 400 Yuan Mark

The yarn market is as calm as ever, with a slightly softening trend. Because the end of the year is approaching, businesses and industries are busy closing accounts. Everyone is preparing to drink the God of Wealth wine, so the market is in a state of leisure and stability. The purchasing groups are also inactive and will wait until next spring to make plans. All transactions are sporadic and speculative in nature, and actual business seems to be at a standstill. Based on the above situation, there is unlikely to be any major change in the market prospects during this year-end period.

When the spot yarn market opened in the morning, there were fewer attendees than before, and the atmosphere was more dissipated. Colleagues gathered and said there would be no major transactions and that the development of the New Year's Red Plate business must be awaited next spring, so most of the mobile brokers were wandering around without clients. The market only opened around 10 o'clock, and the situation was very bleak. Opening prices were similar to the previous day, with 20-count Double Horse priced at 400.005 yuan. The Hong Kong group bought five bales. After that, transactions remained sparse, and the market price fell back again. The price of 20-count Double Horse later broke the 400 yuan mark, at 399.5 yuan. Warehouse receipts were made at 397.5 yuan, but when prices were low, those with money still came to buy cheaply, so market prices were stable and not loose. It was found that only 460 bales were transacted in the morning, with transactions between colleagues accounting for half. The price of 20-count Double Horse fell by one yuan compared to the previous day, 20-count Special Jincheng fell by one yuan, Tiannv fell by one and a half yuan, Double Earth fell by two yuan, and the decline in 10-count coarse yarn was slightly slower. Due to the depletion of inventory, the factory opened up 100 bales of 20-count Jinhu from Xinsheng Factory at a price of 390 yuan, for March-April futures, with a deposit of 30 yuan per piece. Yesterday, 65 pieces were shipped to Ningbo. The amount purchased by each purchasing group is recorded on the left.

The Japanese yarn market is quiet and in a state of standstill, so market prices are also unstable and declining. The price of 20-count Shuiyue spot yarn is 325 yuan, and the price of 20-count Lanfeng spot yarn is 320 yuan, which is about 2-3 yuan lower than the previous day. There were not many transactions for next month's 20-count Lanfeng yarn at a price of around 323.4 yuan.

### Piece Goods – Stocking Up Within the Year More Profitable; Search for Spot Goods Very Active

The local cloth market is quiet, and the delivery of purchased goods is still quite busy. The price situation is trending tight, because the factory's March futures require each piece to be priced according to the current market plus one or two dimes, while the opening price for stocking up spot goods within the year can still be slightly deducted according to the market, which has aroused the thoughts of those in the local street with ample capital to hoard goods in the short term. Over 200 bales of fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth were transacted. The Ningbo group also purchased 50 bales each of Dapeng cannon vehicle fine cloth and Zhenzhong 16-pound coarse cloth. The Guangdong group and the local dyeing factory continued to purchase over 100 bales of fine twill spot goods. The Southwest Sichuan, Yunnan, Fujian, and Shantou groups have also stopped purchasing, but are still accepting various colored cloth, bleached cloth, and printed goods assigned by various factories, storing them and waiting to rush the loading on ships in the next few days.

As the Lunar New Year approaches, stockers' demand for Eastern cloth continues to be strong, sparing no effort to search for spot goods, causing all stalls to consistently raise prices, with the most significant increases in fine cloth and fine twill. In addition to rising by one dime per piece yesterday, high-end 彩球 (Colorful Ball), 陽鶴 (Yang Crane), and 飛魚 (Flying Fish) brands of fine cloth have exceeded the 12 yuan mark. Local colleagues and outsiders have brought in over 2,000 pieces of stock, and have ordered around 1,000 pieces of futures from various firms. The opening price for 12-pound fine cloth 龍頭 (Dragon Head) is 12.35 yuan, 藍鷄 (Blue Chicken) 12.1 yuan, 雙魚 (Double Fish) 12 yuan, and 喇叭 (Trumpet) 12.05 yuan. The opening price for 龍頭 (Dragon Head) fine twill is 11.75-8 yuan, and 雙魚 (Double Fish) fine twill is 11.5 yuan.

Yesterday, 295 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Ningbo.

### Miscellaneous Grains – Scattered Transactions of Yellow Beans

The yellow bean market has shown little fluctuation during this end-of-year period. Purchasing groups are closing out positions and must wait for the Red Plate. Only the local street still has scattered transactions. Yesterday, over 200 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans were opened at prices of 7.7-7.6 yuan, and 10 bags of Pinghu Du beans at a price of 9.17 yuan.

### Coal – Coal Briquettes Adopt the Policy of Small Profits and Quick Turnover

The coal briquette market situation: because of the severe cold weather, sales are very strong. In the past winters, prices would definitely be raised. This year, due to competition among colleagues, the policy of small profits and quick turnover is adopted, so the board prices have remained stable recently. The prices are as follows: Yitaixing's own brand coal briquettes are 33 yuan per ton, Nanyang 32 yuan, small factory goods 30 yuan, and 29.5 yuan, etc. Colleagues pick up goods by themselves and send them to another company for an additional fee. Retail sales from the factory are around 1.78 yuan per load.

### Washington University Basketball Team to Perform in Shanghai; Not Yet Approved by New York; Leaving the Philippines for Shanghai Next Monday; The Team's Strength is Exceptionally Strong

(Associated Press, Manila, 9th) Ross Warner, captain of the Seattle Amateur Athletic Association basketball team (composed of basketball stars from the University of Washington), told the Associated Press tonight that the team is eager to hold an exhibition match with a Chinese team in Shanghai, but as of now, they have not received a reply from the highest US authority, the National Amateur Athletic Association, approving the request. Warner said he would cable New York again tonight, requesting permission. If permission is not granted, they will have to decline the exhibition. The team will depart from the Philippines for Shanghai next Monday aboard the Empress of Russia. As for the Japanese University United Basketball Team, which is currently touring the Philippines, they have lost all three games in the Philippines, all defeated by the team. The two teams are scheduled to meet again in Japan, but this also requires permission from New York. The average height of the team members is over six feet, and three of them represented the team at the Berlin World Games. The remaining five have been on the same team from high school to university, and all are former members of the University of Washington team. The team's strategy, tactics, and personnel use a man-to-man defense. In attack, their use of the eighth type of offensive when shooting a one-handed overhead shot is very skillful.

### West Qing Basketball; 國光 (National Glory) Easily Defeats 震旦 (Aurora); 麥金 (Mackenzie) and 華聯 (Hua Lian) Achieve Victory

In West Qing Basketball, the three games last night, as expected, all ended in a one-sided situation. 國光 (National Glory), 麥金 (Mackenzie), and 華聯 (Hua Lian) successively achieved victory. In the first game, 國光 (National Glory) vs. 震旦 (Aurora), 國光 (National Glory) took the lead from the start, leading the first half 27-19. 震旦 (Aurora) eventually lost 42-65. 邱孝慈 (Qiu Xiaoci) of 國光 (National Glory) scored 28 points alone, and 李祖德 (Li Zude) scored 22 points. 孔夢熊 (Kong Mengxiong) of 震旦 (Aurora) was able to score 16 points. 慕爾 (Muir) vs. 麥金 (Mackenzie), 慕爾 (Muir) was at a disadvantage in the first half with a score of 9-26. 麥金 (Mackenzie) won easily with a result of 55-27. In the third game, 華聯 (Hua Lian) vs. 啟昌 (Qi Chang), after the start, the two sides competed fiercely. 華聯 (Hua Lian) was greatly threatened and even fought to a 16-16 tie. After 張世榮 (Zhang Shirong) was called out, they began to gain the upper hand. 啟昌 (Qi Chang) trailed by ten points in the first half at 34-24. In the second half after the break, 啟昌 (Qi Chang) squandered many opportunities, giving 華聯 (Hua Lian) a chance to capitalize. 李震中 (Li Zhenzhong) ran all over the field, scoring most of the points. Neither team had any coordination and only showed individual performances. Two generals from 華聯 (Hua Lian), 孫惠培 (Sun Huipei) and 孔廣益 (Kong Guangyi), were absent yesterday. It seems like an oversight that three players from 華聯 (Hua Lian) did not report to the recorder before participating in the game in the second half. As a result, 華聯 (Hua Lian) won 64-49.

### 中西 (Zhongxi) Secondary School Basketball Game; 僑光 (Qiao Guang) Defeats 東吳 (Soochow); Result 49-30

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in order to raise funds for refugee production and education, has specifically established an Education Group Fundraising Committee. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, at the Shipping Club located at 93 Guangdong Road, a joint meeting of middle school principals was convened. Over fifty schools attended, and it was decided to hold a publicity week starting on the 13th of this month, and to launch fundraising efforts starting on the 18th, for a period of one week, with a target goal of 100,000 yuan. Details of the meeting are recorded as follows:

Participating Schools: In addition to the fundraising committee members of the association, Lin Kanghou, Xi Yushu, and Chen Jicheng, the following schools were represented: Provincial Shanghai Middle School, Xin Huan, Guangyi, Minli Girls' Middle School, Shanghai Girls' Middle School, Private Shanghai Middle School, Dao Yi, Jun Yi, Xiang Yao, Minguo, Xin Bei, Lequn, Zhengguang, Kun Fan, Shenmei, Xin Ya, and over fifty other schools. Principals Wu Zhiqian, Feng Yixian, Zhang Zhonghuan, Xu Zexiang, and over sixty others attended. Following reports by Chairman Xi Yushu, Chen Jicheng, and Lin Kanghou, principals from each school expressed their opinions.

Target Goal: The association has decided that the target for the general mobilization of the education community is 100,000 yuan. It has been decided to hold a publicity campaign week starting on the 13th of this month, and to launch the mobilization on the 18th.

The association has already produced a "Good Deed Badge" featuring a book in the center and the four characters "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy" embedded above. Each donation certificate is worth one yuan, and a badge will be given in return. It is estimated that there are 300,000 students in the city, including 150,000 elementary school students, 100,000 middle school students, and 50,000 university students and supplementary school students. If half of them donate, the goal can be exceeded. At the meeting, the principals confirmed the number of donations, already reaching over 20,000 yuan. The association will issue a receipt that can be used to collect the Good Deed Badge at the Shanghai Bank and its branches.

Unified Mobilization: In addition to the private middle schools that pledged donations yesterday, missionary schools and schools established by the Public Works Department (工部局) will be contacted by Chen Heqin, the head of the Chinese Education Department of the Public Works Department. He convened a meeting with twelve missionary school principals the day before yesterday, and they have already pledged donations of 5,000 yuan. Other provincial schools will also be promoted. The association will separately distribute methods and send personnel to contact schools that did not participate yesterday.

Reward Methods: The school groups that promote the Good Deed Badge will be awarded in the following two categories: (A) Group Award, (B) Individual Award. A school with students donating Good Deed Badges equivalent to more than half of the school's total enrollment will be awarded a "Good Deed Certificate" from the association.

Students practice calligraphy daily after class, and several thousand new books and thousands of kinds of physics and chemistry equipment have been purchased. Recently, applications from students seeking admission have been pouring in. The school authorities, recognizing the imminent Lunar New Year and the tight financial situation, have specifically set a deadline for registration and extended the payment period. Students who are truly impoverished may be admitted with reduced fees.

Shanghai School for the Deaf and Mute: The school has been established for many years and has a proven track record. It was originally located in Laoximen. After the incident, it moved to 7 Junle Village, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Danshui Road, and resumed classes. The students are developing exceptionally well. It is reported that starting this semester, in order to encourage outstanding deaf and mute students to pursue their education, the school's board of directors has decided to establish ten scholarships. All deaf and mute students who excel in academics and conduct, or who are from impoverished families and demonstrate exceptional academic performance, are eligible for scholarship benefits.

### Expansion of Shanghai Baptist Academy

The Shanghai Baptist Academy, a middle school affiliated with Shanghai Baptist University, has been operating at 209 Tuming Road for three semesters. Under the management and planning of Dr. Li Haoshan, the principal, various facilities have gradually been restored to their former state. The student body consists of 430 students, and the school is unable to admit more due to limited space. Last semester, the school moved most of its books and equipment from the original campus in Yangshupu. Next semester, it plans to further expand the existing library and laboratories to enhance their resources. The school is scheduled to hold entrance exams for new students on February 21st, with registration on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th, and classes commencing on the 27th. It is said that a considerable number of applicants have registered for the exams.

School Overview

### Shanghai Academy of Chinese Studies

The Shanghai Academy of Chinese Studies is a newly emerged sprout of Chinese studies on this isolated island. For the school's founding purpose and motivation, see the school's charter, "The purpose of this academy is to study the culture of our country through the ages, to understand its essence and apply it, to promote and expand it, and to benefit the national spirit." The academy is located in a portion of the Minguo Middle School building at 289 Weihaiwei Road. It was founded in January of the year before last by over ten veteran scholars of Chinese studies, including Jiang Zhuzhuang, Hu Pu'an, Feng Mingquan, Yao Minghui, Shen Xinqing, Lü Simian, Li Zhongqian, Ren Weizhi, Xu Chunrong, and Sun Deyu. It officially opened on February 21st. Because it was a newly established specialized school, the number of students enrolled at the time was not large. It has gradually increased, and now there are over a hundred students. Approximately two-tenths of them are special students.

Internally, it is divided into undergraduate, preparatory, and refresher courses. Admission to the undergraduate course requires a high school diploma, the preparatory course a junior high school diploma, and the refresher course requires an elementary school diploma.

In addition to the director Feng Mingquan, Yao Minghui serves as the academic dean, and Feng Yixian as the chief administrator. All professors are the founders, each taking on different teaching responsibilities.

As for the academic subjects, the undergraduate first year includes subjects such as the Analects, Introduction to Chinese Studies, Mencius, Prose, Records of the Grand Historian, Composition, Poetry, and History of Literature. The preparatory first year includes subjects such as Prose, Poetry, Classic of Filial Piety, General History, Analects, Composition, and Calligraphy. This semester, both undergraduate and preparatory courses are divided into upper and lower semesters for the first and second years, and the enrollment quota will be expanded to recruit new students. Special students may be admitted without examination. This is truly an excellent opportunity to study Chinese studies. The school's first new student entrance examination date has passed. The second exam is scheduled for the 12th of this month. The start of school is February 23rd. This is a piece of news to inform the readers.

Spring and Autumn

### The Money Shop Industry in Shanghai

— Investigator

The money shop industry in Shanghai occupies an extremely important position in China's financial world. It has a long history, with money shops existing even before the port opening. Originally, Shanghai was a crucial hub for north-south shipping a century ago. The northern transport of rice from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the southern transport of miscellaneous grains from the Northeast were centered in Shanghai, with a forest of masts and frequent trade. The collection and settlement of debts and the management of funds naturally required a third party to provide services. Thus, the organization of money shops came into being. Later, it closely followed Shanghai's progress and developed rapidly. Today, it has evolved with the times to occupy a central position in the financial sector alongside the banking industry.

Shanghai's money shops are divided into "remittance," "skipping," and "money exchange" categories. "Remittance" money shops are members of the Shanghai Money Industry Association. "Skipping" money shops are not qualified to join the association, although their business is very similar to that of "remittance" shops. "Skipping" money shops are further divided into the four types: Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen, based on differences in their capital status. As for "money exchange" money shops, they are the organizations with the least capital and the smallest scope in the money shop industry, fundamentally different from "remittance" and "skipping" shops.

The heart of the Shanghai money shop industry lies in the "remittance" shops, so to discuss the money shop industry, one must talk about "remittance" shops.

In the early days, a "remittance" shop with a capital of 20,000 or 30,000 taels was considered to be large-scale. Today, however, 100,000 or 200,000 taels is not uncommon, and there are even several with 500,000 or 1 million taels. Their organization is based on partnerships. Before starting business, they must first join the association. When joining the association, they must submit the total amount of capital, the names of shareholders, and the shares they hold to the association. These are then reviewed by representatives of all members, voted on, and approved. The restrictions are very strict, and it is difficult to pass without wealthy shareholders and 阿大先生 (managers) with outstanding reputations. The amount of tangible capital possessed by the money shop itself is not considered to be a critical issue. However, in recent years, in order to consolidate their foundations, money shops have increased their capital significantly compared to the past.

In the past, money shops in the Nanshi area were mostly located in the inner roads area, while those in the Beishi area were mostly located in the back roads area (Ningbo Road), due to the convenience of conducting business with various merchants and interacting with other shops. In recent times, however, they have mostly clustered in the Beishi area, with fewer in the Nanshi area, because commerce is concentrated in the Beishi area.

The task of the money shops, of course, is to promote the market and support commerce, so their relationship with businesses in various industries is very close. Early on, their main business was extending credit and loans. Nowadays, due to the experience of failures from exclusively engaging in credit lending, the business of money shops is no longer confined to the old scope. In other words, in the past, money shops focused on the commercial sector. All loans were based on the investigations and experience of the manager (阿大先生) and runners. The quality of the customer, the quality of their credit, and the gains and losses of the business could all be transformed from bad to good, from inferior to superior, and from loss to gain based on personal relationships. The money shops realized that this business approach was not viable in modern society and was inherently risky, so they changed their approach and began to provide services to society, such as accepting current account deposits, establishing insurance businesses, conducting trust operations, and managing warehousing businesses, which also have a considerable history.

The Shanghai Money Industry Association is the result of the transformation of the former Money Industry Association. The purpose of its organization is to promote social welfare and protect the interests of its members. In the early days, however, it was simply a place for members to gather for spring and autumn sacrifices, like other trade associations. Later, spurred on by the times, it successfully became an organization for promoting the interests of its members and a place for remittance and interbank lending. During the January 28th Incident, in order to cope with the turbulent situation, they established a money shop reserve under the Money Industry Association. The money shop reserve not only safeguarded the collective property of the members but also served as a clearinghouse for collections and payments and as a conduit for interbank lending. The organization of the money shop reserve not only saved the money shop industry from crisis at the time but also stabilized the confidence of the entire financial market. It has indelible achievements and valuable records in the history of the money shop industry.

After the August 13th Incident, the people in the Shanghai money shop industry also provided a great deal of effort for the war of resistance, but because the people in the money shop industry are generally fond of quiet and dislike movement, their direct contributions were limited, which is regrettable, as it has led to them being forgotten.

The god of war brought by the Fascist behemoth has destroyed everything in old China without leaving anything behind. The Shanghai money shop industry, of course, could not escape this great calamity of invasion. So now they are also facing a fate that requires arduous struggle. At the same time, the foundation of the Shanghai money shop industry in the past was based on the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but now the wealthy areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been reduced to ruins. They have deeply felt that their foundation has been lost, and their future is quite frightening. Therefore, they are preparing to learn from this bloody lesson and seek to develop work in the interior, in order to seek their own recovery and the rebirth of their business.

### Sending Off the Kitchen God

— Geng

On the 23rd day of the twelfth lunar month of the defunct calendar, people who are superstitious of ghosts and gods generally perform the ritual of sending off the kitchen god. It is said that the kitchen god is responsible for auditing the merits and demerits of people, and that "On the night of the lunar month, the kitchen god also ascends to heaven to report the sins of the people." This is the date for the general annual report, so people carefully prepare wine and fruit, supply candles and incense, and piously worship and send off the god's image. The Kitchen God Emperor then ascends to the blue sky in "a cup of clear tea and a wisp of smoke."

The purpose of sending off the kitchen god is, needless to say, to hope that when the "Kitchen God Emperor ascends to the blue sky," he will help you say a few good words, so that you can obtain the consequence of "adding blessings and longevity." Only then will there be this "flattery" action. However, the cunning ones, fearing that the kitchen god will only state the faults and not praise the merits in his oral report, prepare two main offerings among the wine, fruit, and offerings: one is kitchen candy, and the other is glutinous rice cake (粢粑). The function of the kitchen candy is to sweeten the kitchen god's mouth, hoping that he will say good things. The function of the glutinous rice cake is to stick the kitchen god's mouth, hoping that he will not say anything. This is proof of good intentions!

No matter how long the story of sending off the kitchen god is, no matter how profound the meaning of sending off the kitchen god is, it is ultimately a superstitious legend, a superstitious action. Only those ignorant men and women will practice it tirelessly and believe in it unswervingly. People in the city have gradually forgotten the story of sending off the kitchen god, so the enjoyment that the kitchen god used to get in Shanghai was also very miserable. Now that Shanghai has become an isolated island, his fate is even more tragic. The kitchen where he usually hovers has mostly been turned into a bedroom due to the dense population, and he has lost his original territory, or he has been moved to the terrace, or he has been moved to the courtyard, living a life of sleeping outdoors. The kitchen god sighs every day in this environment: "The kitchen has collapsed."

However, in the fate of "the kitchen collapsing," there is also a miraculous encounter of "rebuilding the stove." Originally, the policy of fooling the people is the true royal morality. Teaching the common people to be superstitious of ghosts and gods is the simplest and most effective method of fooling the people. Those "nouveau riche" use the kitchen god as a tool to promote things they hate in order to ingratiate themselves with their "masters."

However, the kitchen god cannot save the "nouveau riche" from the fate of "the kitchen collapsing."

### Calligraphy and Environment

— Li Xiaobai

As for the physical environment, what should it be like? In the writer's opinion, the writing room should ideally be bright with clean windows and tables. The steles and calligraphy models for practicing calligraphy, as well as the four treasures of the study (paper, ink, brush, and inkstone), should be readily available. It's not necessary to seek the most exquisite, but simply that which is suitable for use (except for those with sufficient financial resources). With such an environment, it will be enough to increase the interest in calligraphy. Like the writer in the past, due to rushing around for food and clothing, I rarely had the opportunity to interact with my children except during the summer and winter vacations. This time, I brought my family to Shanghai to seek refuge. My children, who used to board at school, are now all attending school as day students. In the evening, two or three friends often come to my residence to discuss calligraphy issues. Sometimes I write on behalf of others, and my children carefully observe from the side. They become excited and often imitate me afterward. So, I displayed all the calligraphy models in the room, so they could recognize and copy them, and I explained what steles they were, when they were created, and their origins. I also explained what calligraphy models they were, which dynasty and which person wrote them, what their advantages were, and which steles they were based on. I also selected several that they should practice. For example, my eldest daughter, Yingdi, likes to write 大權 (large characters). Based on her brush strokes, I chose the Xuanmi Tower Stele of the Liu style. My son, Qide, likes to practice various styles. Based on his brush strokes, I designated him to practice the Stone Drum Inscription for seal script, the Liqi Stele for clerical script, the Yan Family Stele for regular script, and the Songfeng Pavilion of Huang Shangu for running script. My youngest son, Qijia, also practices the Family Temple Stele. After designating the styles, I only allow them to look at other calligraphy models, not to practice them at the same time, so as not to be indecisive. Thus, they have a rough understanding of the basics. As for regular script, they already had some foundation, and the progress in running script is equal to that of clerical and seal script. In this way, I don't have to urge them every day, and they will naturally spread out paper and pick up brushes, writing several sheets in a row. Paper, brush, and calligraphy models are not a problem, but the problem is the ink. Many people like to write calligraphy very much, but the fact that grinding ink takes quite a bit of time reduces their interest in calligraphy. With this in mind, and considering that the winter vacation is a great opportunity for my children to practice calligraphy, I borrowed a large Han brick inkstone that is very easy to grind ink from a friend. Every morning, I instruct my eldest daughter to grind ink for half an hour, which can be used to write hundreds of small regular script characters. After breakfast, they energetically pick up their brushes and write large characters on several sheets. After writing for an hour, they do other homework. After reading storybooks after lunch, they will also happily pick up their brushes and engage in the ink pond. Because they have the ideal state of "grinding ink to be thick and licking the brush to be full," they write happily at any time. My friend, Hu Shikai, also creates a suitable environment for his children to write calligraphy. So his children have a strong interest in calligraphy. They have a family tradition and write good Wang style calligraphy. When we meet, we often cite this as a happy thing. From this, we can see that the material environment of calligraphy is sufficient to dominate everything. How can we ignore it?

As for time, we believe that having plenty of time is certainly the best. Otherwise, it is fine to set aside one hour every morning and evening to write calligraphy. It is also acceptable to set aside half an hour, or even twenty or fifteen minutes. In fact, the prerequisite issue for writing calligraphy is still the human environment and the physical environment. Because the crux of calligraphy lies in the word "method." To clearly understand the method, one must rely on the guidance of someone who clearly understands the method. Without a suitable physical environment, even if there is a good method, it will be useless. If one only has plenty of time and does not pay attention to the human environment and the physical environment, even if one writes from morning to night every day, disregarding other matters, it will be of no help. This is the first thing we must clearly understand about calligraphy. (No remuneration)

### The Culprit

— Li Zhihua

"Law of the Underworld"

RKO Pictures, opens at the Grand Light Theater

"The Culprit" is another film aimed at "stabilizing society," but this one lacks G-Men. The author makes the "culprit" "moved" by the "tearful plea" of a loving couple, "ultimately unable to sacrifice their happiness," and thus "resolutely confesses and submits to punishment."

The "culprit" who "resolutely confesses and submits to punishment" is a wealthy young man named Filmore. In these "Blue Eagle" films in America, it is common for the culprit to be a social leader. I dare not say whether this is true, but the intention is easy to see: to explain risky behavior as the unearned gains of those who do not worry about food and clothing. In this way, the instability of society is concealed, and the film jumps over this shadow of instability to stabilize things. This self-deceiving intention is bitter.

Another way of dealing with gangs is through "shoot-to-kill" G-Men, but that is usually not how wealthy young men with social status are treated. People like wealthy young men are "moved" by the "tears" of a loving couple and "resolutely confess and submit to punishment."

"The Culprit" is just one example.

As for the acting in this play, it is flat and uninspired, with no highs or even moments of tension. Chester Morris and Ann Sothern are also extremely bland.

### Letter to the Editor

Mr. Fangzheng:

I have received and read the letter that you entrusted to the Spring and Autumn editorial department. However, my name is not only my childhood name, but also the name I have used for submitting articles for six or seven years. It is ridiculous that you ask me to change my name. There is no trademark registration for writing under a pen name, so if you can use it, I can also use it. If you want to avoid the same name, wouldn't it be more convenient for you to change your own name than to ask me to change mine? A hasty reply, wishing you all the best. Sincerely, Fangzheng.

### Rain After the Storm

— Bao Tianxiao

Episode 3: Yang Qianrong Yearns for Old Loyalists, Kai Wen Blindly Asks for Words from a Little Teacher

The next day, the two Miss He's were to depart. A car from the hotel would take them to the North Railway Station. This hotel had over thirty cars, large and small, dedicated to picking up and dropping off travelers. Shanghai now had three major railway stations: the South Railway Station, located in the southern part of Shanghai, near where the pre-war South Railway Station was. However, this South Railway Station had recently become prosperous. This was because all trains to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, where trains could pass, departed from the South Railway Station. In particular, the development of southern Shanghai after the war had advanced rapidly. Merchants gathered, relying on the South Railway Station for transportation. The West Railway Station was located between the North and South Railway Stations, right in Shanghai's western district. The area was close to Shanghai's residential area, and this railway station was newly built. The buildings may not have been magnificent, but the scenery was very beautiful. Beside the railway station was also a garden where guests could take a stroll. All freight transportation was done at the North and South Railway Stations, with relatively little at the West Station. Because it was close to the residential area, travelers from the He family used the West Station. There was also the North Railway Station. Speaking of the North Railway Station, whenever there was war in Shanghai, it was always the first to suffer. The current North Railway Station was no longer in its original location, as it was too close to the city and caused many obstructions. The original site had long been used to develop many roads, as the market there expanded northward. There used to be a boundary road, but now there was no such thing as a boundary, so the name "Boundary Road" was also cancelled and called "Old North Station Road." The current North Railway Station was built to be very grand and spectacular, and it was the largest of the three stations in Shanghai. Because Shanghai was also a railway hub, trains going north could reach the Northeast and connect with the Siberian Railway of Soviet Russia. Trains going south could reach Annam and Siam. Trains going west could go directly from Sichuan to Kangding and Tibet. All of these could depart from Shanghai, making Shanghai's railway stations even more prosperous. Roughly every hour, a train departed, day or night. The train the two Miss He's were taking, departing at 9 a.m., was specifically for Nanjing and was a formal Beijing-Shanghai train. However, the speed of the trains had also increased recently, and it took less than five hours to travel from Shanghai to Nanjing. It only took one hour from Shanghai to Suzhou. The more convenient the transportation, the more people traveled back and forth, which was inevitable. Moreover, Shanghai's transportation was not limited to trains; there were also airplanes, steamers, motorboats, cars, and so on. It was truly like having the ability to shrink the land and extend the rooms, and the ability to ride the wind like Liezi. (36)

### Parents of Today

— Mao Lie

"Parents love their children with boundless care." Everyone knows this is as it should be and cannot be criticized. However, the way to love children requires much study. Spoiling children is undesirable, and loving children while expecting them to repay with foolish filial piety is even more undesirable! In normal times, parents should view their children in this way, but in this time of war against aggression, they should especially adhere to this belief!

In writing and in speech, I have personally seen and heard many young people wanting to go to the interior or to the front lines, but parents who claimed to love their children obstructed them. Their reasoning, of course, was that they feared their children would encounter danger if they went out and that it would be safer for them to cower under their protection. They completely failed to consider that in this day and age, there is no safe place, and what is considered safe is only temporary, like a swallow's nest on a curtain! As for treating their children as private property, only knowing how to protect their own assets without regard for the public good of the nation, they not only inflict great harm on the nation but also put their children in a position of great injustice, truly an act of harming others without benefiting oneself! I hope that these parents who claim to love their children can weigh the current situation, change their view of their children, and fulfill their children's great aspirations.

As for children, if their parents' survival is not truly endangered by their saving the country—perhaps they can even go a step further and disregard any danger—they can resolutely and immediately take on the important task of saving the country, without being wishy-washy and worrying too much. They must know that without the nation, there is no family, which is a very obvious reason. Using the body given by their parents for the great cause of saving the country is the true path to honoring their parents and practicing filial piety! The ancients emphasized nourishing the will when speaking of filial piety. We can acknowledge that saving the country is the will of everyone, and the parents of today certainly have this will as well. So why wouldn't they be happy for their children to save the country!

If we extend the question further, the reason why our country is so backward in the modern world may be due to the deep-rooted concept of family. And the "love" and "filial piety" in this concept, when misinterpreted to the point of regression, are even more fatal wounds! It's a long story, so I won't discuss it here.

Wise parents, please look at the fatherly conduct of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Vice Generalissimo Feng Yuxiang, and the motherly conduct of Old Mrs. Zhao!

### Sudden Change

— Wan Yu

It's a 100% fact, Lao Qiao has changed! Changed to the point of being unbelievable!

Seeing Lao Qiao's sudden change in attitude, we can't help but be surprised; however, none of us can guess the reason why Lao Qiao changed so suddenly! He is from outside the pass (Manchuria), and the years of wind and sand have molded him into a tall and sturdy figure. When he speaks, he has to twist his tongue, and when he occasionally learns a few words of southern dialect, he inevitably makes people laugh. Also, like other people from outside the pass, he naturally loves to drink.

Speaking of alcohol, Lao Qiao is probably the best drinker in this group. Those tall, thick bottles, even the strongest sorghum liquor, he can drink five or seven bottles at once. If you forced some people who can't drink to drink it, wouldn't you get thirty or forty people drunk? Obviously, Lao Qiao's drinking capacity can withstand at least thirty or forty people. However, does this make Lao Qiao feel satisfied? No! Absolutely not! He has been in the south for almost seven or eight years, and although he drinks alcohol all day long, constantly from morning till night, he says he has never had a truly satisfying drink like the pure and rich wine he drank outside the pass.

But recently, Lao Qiao has surprisingly quit drinking. For a person to suddenly give up his only hobby of nearly twenty years seems like no small matter; indeed, Lao Qiao has changed in every way, changed so strangely!

Isn't it? Lao Qiao not only gave up alcohol but also shaved off his head of soft, black hair. This is truly a miracle! A few days ago, Lao Qiao would spend most of the morning tidying his hair, believing that whether his hair was neat or not was extremely important to his appearance, so he had to painfully apply expensive pomades and oils to it. But now, unexpectedly, it has all been shaved off with a bright razor, and his fish-white head is very glaring, shiny and wet, like a big radish!

Could it be that Lao Qiao has started to be frugal and is fulfilling the tenets of the new life movement?

It's a mystery: a truly interesting mystery!

Early in the morning, before the sun has even shown its face, when Lao Qiao should still be sound asleep, the 5 o'clock alarm clock rings and wakes him up. He secretly puts on his clothes and quietly leaves the bedroom. He runs alone to the empty field outside to practice running. One circle after another, the newly bought rubber-soled shoes lightly touch the cement on the ground with a "cha-cha-cha" sound. He is not tired, perhaps something makes him forget his fatigue. The field is so vast and wide, thirty laps, fifty laps, or a hundred laps, he strides around tirelessly. After a while, people start watching, but he still runs with such vigor. Only when his breathing becomes rapid and labored does he slowly slow down. However, his whole body is already soaked, and sweat is dripping from his head.

We all wonder: How could Lao Qiao's life change so suddenly?

To uncover the secret reason, we began our search. We secretly checked his belongings, rummaged through his bed, and later found a stack of military books such as "Infantry Drill Regulations" and "Assault Tactics" under his mattress. What? Has Lao Qiao started studying military affairs? He has given up alcohol, shaved his head, and is concentrating on running, and he is also reading these books. What on earth is going on?

We searched again and finally found a letter. We rushed to read it; the letter was brought by someone from his old grandmother outside the pass, and the content roughly said: Lao Qiao's beloved wife had been defiled by demons, and their children had also died under the demons' knives. The conclusion was:

"...The people outside the pass have mostly armed themselves bravely. Since the incident (Mukden Incident) until now, countless people have been sacrificed like your wife and children. But victory will eventually belong to us! Of course, the enemy will now go even more insane, they will massacre even more fiercely. The people here are all prepared and determined to fight to the death! You are lurking in a peaceful metropolis, perhaps drunkenness has made you forget everything!... When can you wake up and pick up a gun to fight them too?"

Sure enough, this bloody truth has awakened the drunkard. Judging by his recent sudden change, he really wants to fight.

Lao Qiao has indeed changed, 100%; a letter from his old grandmother has made him change his attitude towards life. He is about to embark on the path he should be taking.

### A Biographical Account of the Righteous People of Jiading

— Du Xiao

——National Novel Talks

"A Biographical Account of the Righteous People of Jiading" (World Publishing House, four corners), a sister piece to "A Biographical Account of the Righteous People of Jiangyin," has been published. The author, Hu Shanyuan, based his work primarily on Zhu Zisu's "A Brief Record of the Massacre of Jiading" and "Anecdotes of the Ming and Qing Dynasties," yet he was able to write nineteen short stories. His rich imagination and skillful layout truly impress me.

What I like most is the story "Yan Aitang." The original text was only sixty characters in the "Jiading County Records": "Yan Aitang, a scholar, gathered five hundred people with hoes at the southeast yamen of the county. At that time, Li Chengdong attacked Wusong. Aitang lured and killed his younger brother, Li Lin. Chengdong performed a sacrifice and brought all his troops under the city. Aitang fought against the wind to no avail and retreated to the Lotus Pond northeast of the city. Chengdong heard of this and annihilated them completely." The author, however, wrote nearly ten thousand words. The original text only had the six words "lured and killed his younger brother, Li Lin," but the author wrote about how the Qing soldiers laid out their crab-like formation, how the left and right wings circled in, and how Yan Aitang divided his troops into three groups, luring the Qing soldiers to the distant east and west sides, and then how he ambushed them. It is truly written in a lively and vivid manner, even more interesting than reading the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

Also, "Zhu Liu," "Liang Cheng," and "Guo Yuan" are also quite humorous. Zhu Zisu only wrote that Zhu Liu was a "local soldier," but the author added a twist, saying that he was originally a tofu-making apprentice. Zhu Zisu only said that Zhu Liu went to the latrine by the roadside, but the author said that he used the excuse of relieving himself to secretly watch the battle. In this way, the story becomes more vivid. Liang Cheng calmly drowned the traitor as if nothing had happened, which is also humorous. Guo Yuan was a fruit seller who kept using phrases from his trade, scolding the traitors with phrases like "rotten apples, stinky winter melons, overripe plums, mushy cantaloupes, worm-eaten peaches." People on the city wall teased him, "If you dump all this stuff out, won't you lose money?"

In "Yang Kewu," the old cripple Ge and several comrades ambushed Qing soldiers in the dense forest. The layout and atmosphere were good, and I seemed to see the deep and dense elm forest!

The author is best at writing endings. "Zhu Liu," "Old Zhang," and "Zhu Yuanliang" all have a leisurely and distant feel. Zhu Liu's master rode his apprentice's horse and sighed, "Ah Liu is helping me after all." Old Zhang's head hung on the city wall of the south gate, his eyebrows raised and his eyes wide open, awe-inspiring and lifelike. Zhu Yuanliang scuttled his boat, and his whole family drowned themselves. The author did not forget to write about the paper twist used for Zhu Yuanliang's water pipe: "With a 'puff' sound, it was swallowed by the water. The boat lost its trace, and only a patch of bubbles caused by the heavy rain remained on the water." All of these are enough to evoke the reader's lingering thoughts.

As for the parts in the book that are passionate and arouse the reader's patriotic fervor, there are truly too many. This is truly a good book that young people should read carefully.

### Song of the Warrior

— Yang Jinzhen

Wind

The wind rises from the horizon behind,

Passes through the vast plains,

Climbs over wrinkled mountain ridges,

And shaves across my sharp blade.

It blows across the bloodstained grasslands,

And ignites the torch of resistance!

Blazing, spreading.

Carrying forty-five thousand

Expectations of victory,

And the stirring heartstrings of my brothers!

Please take the lead,

Fly towards the enemy lines,

See what their movements are:

I will follow closely behind you.

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

Three: Covering the Retreat

The sky was gloomy, the road was a white blur. Regiment Commander Ye ran non-stop along the road. The farm men and women working busily in the fields beside the road stopped their work and looked at him in surprise. He paid them no mind. However, seeing that everything was normal for them, he felt slightly reassured, thinking that the situation ahead might not be as tense as he had imagined.

Who knew that this peace of mind would not last long? After running fifteen li, the number of fleeing civilians gradually increased, supporting the old and carrying the young, with bags and suitcases, their expressions panicked and hurried. When he asked them about the situation ahead when they fled, their accounts were inconsistent. Regiment Commander Ye could not get a clear picture and had to continue running forward. When he reached a place not far from his defense area, there were even more people fleeing, like an overwhelming surge. At this time, a plane flew in the sky and circled over everyone's heads. The fleeing people screamed and scattered in all directions, shouting and crying, creating a chaotic scene. Regiment Commander Ye quickly crouched behind a large tree and saw everyone running towards crowded places. He was about to come out and stop them, but a bomb had already torn through the air with a "hissing" sound. He had no choice but to remain crouched down.

"Boom!—" Another earth-shattering sound. Regiment Commander Ye instinctively buried his face in his hands. He felt his body shaking as if in a stormy sea, followed by a rain of soil kicked up by the explosion falling straight down. Suddenly, something fell in front of him with a thud. When he looked, it was a bloodstained human leg that had just been blown off, the skin and flesh still stickily connected...

Regiment Commander Ye gritted his teeth, jumped up and ran again, running all the way to the Guandi Temple, where his regiment was supposed to be located. But he did not see his own troops, only friendly troops and wounded soldiers retreating from the front lines. Fortunately, there was a messenger left there. From his report, Regiment Commander Ye learned that his own troops had been ordered to go outside the railway line four hours earlier to build fortifications and take up defense. So, he asked the messenger to lead him forward.

In a farm cottage outside the railway line, Regiment Commander Ye found his temporary office. Deputy Regiment Commander Liang Yibo, who was with him day and night, was sitting at his desk, holding a military phone, busily talking. On the other side sat Staff Officer Zhu Guoxiong, also busy issuing orders. Regiment Commander Ye barged in and asked without delay:

"What is the situation at the front?"

Deputy Regiment Commander Liang put down the military phone, stood up, and greeted Regiment Commander Ye with a kind but serious smile, saying:

"It's alright, the enemy hasn't gotten close yet. But the situation is very critical. We are rushing to build defensive fortifications. Their planes have already bombed us, but luckily we were well camouflaged and suffered very little damage. They will probably be back in a while."

As he spoke, he pointed to the military map on the desk, drawn to a scale of one millionth, and drew a semi-circular line, saying:

"Our defense line is arc-shaped, guarding the middle of the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Suzhou-Jiaxing railways, with special emphasis on the northeast sides. The railway line area is defended by two other regiments, along with other friendly troops. But we just received a military report that the enemy is also developing along the Pinghu road. Although they have been blocked by our troops, a major battle is about to break out. If Pinghu is lost, then the position of Jiaxing will be very dangerous, and our entire defense line will be shaken."

Regiment Commander Ye frowned tightly, and his knuckles cracked again.

"I never expected the enemy to advance so quickly. Judging from the defense situation in Shanghai, I thought it would take at least half a month for them to reach here, so I dared to go home without worrying. I didn't expect it to deteriorate so badly in one day!"

"The enemy's vanguard is indeed very sharp, especially their artillery fire is very fierce. Now our troops in western Shanghai have also retreated, and it is very likely that the enemy will bypass Qingpu and go south, attacking this place in a pincer movement. Now that things have come to this, we can only fight with our flesh and blood, as the vanguard of the regimental defense!" Deputy Regiment Commander Liang said with excitement. (10)

Entertainment World

### New Lineups in Various Cinemas for the Lunar New Year

— Willow Catkins

One: News of New Theater Openings

The Lunar New Year is coming soon. This is the season when the entertainment business flourishes. Everyone has some free time, and the average citizen also has some spare money to spend on entertainment. No wonder every theater and dance hall is packed to the brim. Since the war, Shanghai's population has exploded, and the existing theaters cannot meet the demand, so there are three new theaters opening. They are all preparing to open during this Lunar New Year. This is truly good news for Shanghai movie fans. The names and addresses of the three theaters are as follows:

Shanghai Light Grand Theater, east of the Grand China Dance Hall on Avenue Edward VII. Will screen both first-run Chinese and Western blockbusters. Golden Gate Grand Theater, Avenue Foch, will screen both Chinese and Western films. Ping An Grand Theater, at the original site of the An Kai Di Shopping Center on Bubbling Well Road, will specialize in Western films.

Every film production company is also rushing to produce blockbusters for the Lunar New Year to meet the demands of the audience. It's no coincidence that all the new Chinese films released this New Year are historical dramas. Moreover, they were all produced at great expense. This has to be said to be a welcome phenomenon. The leading actresses in these three historical blockbusters, except for Zhou Xuan, can be said to be newcomers to the Shanghai screen. And all three are female stars who are filming historical dramas for the first time. Originally, only the Jincheng and Xinguang theaters were the first to show domestic films. Now, with the addition of the newly opened Shanghai Light, the three are now on equal footing, adding a lot of excitement to the film scene. The details are as follows:

"Mulan Joins the Army" - Shanghai Light This beautiful historical tale that has been passed down through the ages is now on the screen for the second time. During the silent film era, it was once filmed by the Minxin Company, starring Li Dandan, who was also the famous female aviator Li Xiaqing in her early years. This time, Chen Yunshang, a famous socialite from the South, was specially invited to play the leading role. This is Chen Yunshang's first starring role since joining the Shanghai Guochao Film Company. It was produced by Huacheng Film Company and directed by Bu Wancang, the director of "Diao Chan." The male lead is Mei Xi, and the supporting cast is the entire team from Xinhua Company. The film has magnificent sets and a grand scale, breaking all previous records for domestic films. It will be screened with honor at the newly opened Shanghai Light Grand Theater. Chen Yunshang is now the star that Shanghai movie fans are longing to see. With the release of this blockbuster, she will surely make a big splash. Let's wait and see.

"The Hegemon-King of Chu" - Xinguang The old shop Yihua has reopened and decided to try filming this ancient historical blockbuster. As expected, it went all out, and the results are remarkable. The actor playing the Hegemon-King is Wang Yuanlong, an old-timer on the silver screen. Mr. Wang has been away from the film industry for many years, and perhaps many movie fans have gradually forgotten him. But he has made a comeback and is still making a big splash. The female lead is Jin Suqin, a famous Peking opera actress, in her debut on the silver screen. Although it is her first time trying a new voice, she is, after all, a famous Kunqu opera actress who is used to playing ancient beauties, and will undoubtedly give movie fans a new style. The director is Wang Jielong, and the supporting cast includes Wang Naidong, Guan Hongda, and dozens of others.

"Meng Jiangnu" - Jincheng Mr. Liu, the owner of Jincheng, invested in the first historical drama of the newly established Guohua Film Company. Meng Jiangnu is played by Zhou Xuan. This long-separated star sings several songs in the film, and the results are excellent. In particular, the old song "Meng Jiangnu," which is well-known to every household, is sung with particular sadness and poignancy. Everyone believes that not only is singing Zhou Xuan's specialty, but also that Zhou Xuan is the most suitable person to play Meng Jiangnu at present. The supporting cast consists of several talented new stars from the Mingxing Actors Training Institute. The director is Wu Cun. He first tasted the flavor of filming historical dramas in "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian," and this "Meng Jiangnu" is his second successful work. Mr. Liu of Jincheng naturally wants to choose this good season to screen the blockbuster he produced himself in his own theater, so as to avoid the outflow of profits, and obtaining the title is naturally what he expects.

### Major Events in Small Theaters

— Man Fu

Time is running out, the end of the year is approaching, and the drums of the twelfth month are ringing frequently. The various stages in Shanghai have closed down one after another. What is recorded here are the events and affairs of artists in small theaters before they closed down.

Tan Jinlin Performs Centipede Ridge for the First Time Tan Jinlin, a female warrior actress from the Chang Le Theater, is the daughter of the old performer Tan Yongkui. Yongkui was a long-time partner of Gai Jiaotian. Jinlin's performances indirectly embody the essence of the Gai school, retaining the style of Gai Jiaotian's prime years. Recently, she learned the play "Centipede Ridge" and performed it the night before last. Her father played the Centipede Taoist, with the typical old-school style vividly before our eyes. That night, many people from the literary and artistic circles came to watch and greatly appreciated Jinlin's wearing thick-soled boots to run the "zou bian" (a type of stage movement). It is said that Jinlin's contract with Chang Le ends tonight, and she will stop performing tomorrow. She has been hired by the Era Theater, because Era has always lacked warrior actors, and Jinlin's joining is a gain for both sides.

Wang Wenjuan Performs Two Excellent Plays in Cross-Dressing The Era Theater is scheduled to close down tomorrow night (the 12th). All the actors will perform in cross-dressing. Female performer Zhang Wenjuan will perform two acts in drag. The plays are the second act of "Hong Ni Guan" as the maid, and "The Broken Temple" as Zhu Guangzu. Wenjuan has never performed Hua Dan (female comic) plays before, so she sought advice from Li Xuefang, a Kun Dan (female role) from the Gong Stage. Feng Qi, a "Qi school" old Sheng (male role) from the same stage, will also perform in drag as Liu Xingyan in "The Brahma Palace" and Bian Guangzu in "The Broken Temple," transforming the play.

Wang Cuiyun Will Be Recommended to Zheng Zibao Wang Cuiyun, a female performer from the Chang Le Theater, is the daughter of the late comedian Wang Xianneng. Her acting skills are good, but unfortunately, she is not valued by others. Recently, Chang Le reorganized its team, and the actors were slightly changed. Cuiyun was also among those who were dismissed. The old painter Xi Muqin felt pity for this descendant of "a generation of artists" and planned to introduce her to Master Meihua Zheng Zibao and have her accepted as a female disciple. Mr. Zheng is a senior Pingju actor who spares no effort in promoting younger generations. He is well-acquainted with the opera world. The famous female performers Du Liyun, Yun Yanxia, and Zheng Xichun are all his students. In the future, Wang Cuiyun should no longer be frustrated in small theaters.

### A Brief Account of Hong Kong Film Companies' Productions Last Year (Part 2)

— Sent from Hong Kong by Nie Ge

Da Guan Company: Da Guan Company is the predecessor of the former Lianhua Company's Hong Kong branch. Later, it was transferred to Zhao Shusang. Zhao was a student who studied in the United States and interned in Hollywood to learn film techniques. His works are more progressive. Last year, he produced 14 films, including "Universal Celebration," "Continuing the Golden Mansion of Twelve Hairpins," "Tears of a慈母," "Ten Thousand Lovers," "Hand-to-Hand Combat," "Four Sons Join the Army," "After the Shanghai Fire Line," "Wandering Father," "Seven Fresh Roses," "Stage Spring," "Orphan's Journey," "The Filial Son Escapes Punishment," "Songstress Bai Mudan," and "Saucy Doctor," etc.

Shan Yue Company: This is still a newly established company. The host, Guan Wenqing, also claims to have years of experience in the American film industry. He was the director of Lianhua Company's Hong Kong branch and cooperated with Da Guan Company for many years. Last year, he withdrew and formed Shan Yue Company with邝山笑, a popular actor known in both film and theater. Guan adds the word "Fearless" before "director," for reasons unknown, specializing in shooting vulgar folk stories, even filming the Yan Ruisheng story. This is enough to infer the rest.

Qi Ming Company: Although this company has two film studios, it rarely shoots its own films, specializing in shooting films for small companies. Last year, it only shot one film, "Karmic Debt," itself, while shooting as many as 36 films for others. Sometimes it shoots nine films at the same time, with two groups shooting each day. Each film is shot in one day, and then they have to rest for four or five days before it's their turn again. This is also an abnormal phenomenon in the Hong Kong film industry.

Zhong Guang Company: Zhong Guang is the combined name of Zhong Nan and Guangrong companies. The boss of Zhong Nan Company is Hong Ji (Hong Shen's younger brother, Hong Shen broke off fraternal relations with him because he did not follow the right path), who used to secretly shoot supernatural and erotic films in Shanghai. In Hong Kong, he changed his name to Hong Zhonghao and actually calls himself a great Chinese director. The films he shoots are the most low-level and vulgar, such as "A Good Woman Marries Eighteen Times," "Chen Shimei Denies His Wife," and "Peach Blossom Girl Battles Magic," etc. Each film invariably inserts scenes of women bathing to seduce erotic audiences. It is said that the central government has "filed" artists who disregard national consciousness and become more backward during wartime, and there will be strict measures to deal with them after the war ends.

The main film companies in Hong Kong are the above few. Each has a film studio, but the size and quality of equipment can be distinguished by the order in which they are listed. Other companies that temporarily raise small capital and entrust film companies with film studios to shoot films include Zhihua Company, which produced "National Traitors"; "Women's World," "Red Actress's Elegy," and "Begging for Rice to Support Her Mother-in-Law" by Wo De Company; "The Last Companion" by Da Ganlu Company; "Flesh and Blood Great Wall" by Wenhua Company; "Mistaken Mandarin Ducks" by Xinghua Company; "Burning Spring Love," "Ten Thousand Li Walking Corpses" by Zhengyi Company; "One Night Husband and Wife" by Da Mingxing Company; and "Love Sea Storm" by Qunyi Company, etc.

### "Cowherd and Weaver Girl"

Cowherd: (Gary Cooper) My cow has been slaughtered by the devils!

Weaver Girl: (Merle Oberon) Hey! Our people have also been killed by the devils!

### "The Beginning of Man" Reruns Tomorrow

"The Beginning of Man," the famous play first performed by the Shanghai Drama Society, has been unanimously praised by public opinion, so it has been decided to rerun it. Also, due to contractual relations with the Carlton Theatre, "The Beginning of Man" will only be performed tomorrow (12th) for two shows, day and night.

The play is originally written by French playwright 巴若萊, adapted by Gu Zhongyi, and directed by Wu Ji. The cast includes Zhang Bonan (as Dai Gang), Su Longsheng (as Ye Xiaomei), Mu Ailan (as Zhang Fang), Mu Zongduo (as Xu Li), Tao Kanghou (as Zhou Qi), Xiao Lian (as Xia Xia), Mrs. Bao (as Wang Mengna), Guo Jingting (as Shu Shi), Lu Yunguang (as Sun Maoyun), Servant (as Zhu Fan), Female Typist (as Shen Luo), and Police Officer (as Zhang Ping).

### The Fourth Performance of the Yilin Drama Troupe

The Yilin Drama Troupe is scheduled to give its customary matinee performance at the Carlton Theatre tomorrow (12th) at 10 a.m. The program includes "The Fool" by Chekhov, "Two Friends in Distress" written by Lan Yang, and "Night of Capturing the Tiger" written by Tian Han. It is said that these three famous plays are all written by literary masters, and their brilliance is naturally beyond doubt. Drama lovers should not miss this opportunity.

### A Record of the Famous Amateur Opera Singer's Recording

— Wang Ruoqi

The recording department of Pathé Records has been producing records with harmonious tones and durability in recent years due to its complete equipment. Therefore, as soon as a record is released, it spreads rapidly. Since the impact of the August 13th Incident, the company has stopped recording old operas, regardless of famous amateur singers or famous professional performers. Now, the company has decided to break the rule and record Guo Xiaoqing, a famous amateur opera singer from the Shanghai opera scene. Xiaoqing is from a prominent family in Songjiang, and is naturally generous. He is also good at calligraphy, with a plump and elegant style, deeply capturing the spirit of the Jin Dynasty. He is especially fond of bronze and stone inscriptions, calligraphy, and painting, and has a large collection. He has a special love for old operas. In his early years, he once sacrificed his studies and went to Yandu (Beijing) to study old operas under the tutelage of the old opera master Wang Yaoqing. His strong voice is rare among Wang's students. At the request of Mr. Chuan, he recorded two excerpts from "Su San Escorts," on the afternoon of the 7th. From the shaking board onward, followed by the "Fan Er Huang" aria, it is completely authentic, greatly benefiting scholars. A particularly good point of this record is that the erhu player for Mr. Guo is Mr. Ni Qiuping, who is known as the "King Shaoqing of the South," and the jinghu player is Mr. Ren Shenshou, who regularly tunes the voice for Dr. Mei (Lanfang). The two pieces have erhu embellishments that were recently composed by Mr. Ni. In addition, Mr. Shen Bainian (Mr. Shen's singing and pronunciation have been personally instructed by Dr. Mei) also recorded a piece, one side being the "Siping Diao" from the third act of "Extraneous Biography of True Story of Emperor Ming" and the other side being the "Nanbangzi" connected to "Liushui" from the fourth act. Mr. Ni played the erhu, and I barely played the jinghu. After the recording was completed, a photo was taken together to commemorate the occasion.

### New Look of the Xihai Grand Theatre

— Hui Jun

The Xihai Grand Theatre in the western district of Shanghai has the fourth largest number of seats among all theaters in Shanghai. Its architecture is quite magnificent and spacious. Its film selection is meticulous, adhering to the principle of "rather be refined than indiscriminate." Therefore, it has won widespread sympathy from the citizens of the western district in terms of entertainment. In particular, the reduction in seat prices, from two or three cents to one or two cents, has given small citizens economic savings, bringing the theater and the public together. The films shown adopt a combination of Chinese and Western films. Domestic film companies such as Xinhua, Yihua, and Hua'an, and Western film companies such as MGM, 20th Century Fox, Paramount, and Warner, have signed contracts for priority screenings in the western district. The lighting and sound are the same as the conditions provided by the first-class cinemas in Shanghai. However, the authorities felt that it was not perfect enough, so they specially ordered the latest giant dense automatic light box invented by the American 白倫開脫 Company (Brenkest). It is the first new machine installed in China. In addition, a special new type of real-sound sound machine from the 亞爾西愛 Company (Alsiaiai) was replaced. Now all the machines have been installed and the pronunciation and lighting have a significant difference. The snow-white and silver-like lighting makes people feel comfortable in their vision. The entire theater, inside and out, has also been renovated with a new angle, new equipment and a new look; it has changed into a new one, and meets the people of the western district with each other.

### Secret History of the Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (102)

— Xu Muyun

Two Male Leads, Two Female Leads, and Two Comedians Actually Fighting and Cursing Over Jealousy

Several years ago, I suddenly remembered this incident at Hui Sheng's house, so I said to Hui Sheng: "Why did Xiao Yun scold you back then?" His answer was also very interesting. He said: "I was born to be scolded. I don't know what illness Lord Shang Wang had that day, but he scolded me for no reason." That day, many people who supported Bai Mudan were sitting in the front rows of the Tianchan Stage. Seeing Hui being insulted for no reason, they felt somewhat unfair, so they later especially supported him. These generals who supported Xun were all my old friends, so there is no need to mention them here. Xiao Yun and Hui Sheng have always harbored resentment since then. The root cause is actually jealousy over opera roles.

The remaining painted-face actors are Jin, Hao, and Hou, three people, which are still listenable. Shao Shan was originally often in the South, and his fame came slightly later, so I won't mention him for now. Hao Shuchen was originally from a certain county in Shandong. When he first joined the Beijing troupe, he was not well-known. When Huang San grew old and declined, Shuchen worked hard and emulated his singing and acting. However, he was too fiery, and his early training was not solid, so he was never accepted by connoisseurs. However, scarcity makes things valuable. After the founding of the Republic of China, the talent of painted-face actors gradually declined. Ordinary opera fans couldn't hear Huang San anymore, so they had to use him to satisfy their opera cravings. As the saying goes, "Where there are no pines and cypresses on the mountain, wormwood is also respected." When he performed, because he was short and fat, he had to specially raise the soles of his boots. Because he was all learning Huang San's old age when he lost his teeth and couldn't catch his breath, he deliberately tried his best to breathe, uttering each word outwards. When sitting on a chair, his whole body moved randomly, and his buttocks twisted from side to side, which was very unsightly. Therefore, many colleagues in the pear garden said that he was grinding his teeth and farting, as if there were bedbugs on the chair, biting him so that he couldn't sit still. Although that's what people said, there were actually quite a few people in Beijing who supported him. After he cooperated with Qing Kui and Xiao Lou successively, and arranged several new plays himself, his value became even higher. Outside of Hao, there is also Hou Xirui, who is also learning Huang San's style. Xirui was originally a disciple of the Fu Liancheng Society. Not only was his posture and style good, but his martial arts were also agile. His singing and chanting were also very flavorful. When he was at his most popular, he could rush to four or five troupes in one day. Sometimes on the same day, he would perform "Fa Men Si" in two gardens. After finishing the play in the eastern city, he didn't even wash his face or remove his makeup, hired a car, and hurried to the western city. Others thought that his plays were cheaper than Shuchen's, and the two people's skills were also indistinguishable. Those who supported Hao would support Hou, so they would rather abandon Hao and use Hou.
