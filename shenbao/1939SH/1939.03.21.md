### Significant Shift in the European Situation: Britain in Contact with Six Nations to Encircle Germany

Also Undertaking Preparations on All Fronts; Soviet Union Initiates the Convening of an International Conference

(London) Reuters reports that the British government, regarding the major situation in Central Europe, will soon exchange telegrams and opinions with the governments of the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Bulgaria. Simultaneously, all parties are currently undertaking all preparations. This morning at 10:30, the Cabinet held a full meeting, which adjourned at 12:15. The report from Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, and his opinions to be presented to Parliament this afternoon, were both submitted to the Cabinet for review. While the meeting was in progress, the three opposition leaders, Attlee, Greenwood, and Sinclair, visited 10 Downing Street to inquire about the latest developments in the situation. (Reuters, 20th)

(London) Although today is Sunday, political activity has not ceased. Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, returned from Berlin at 3:30 PM and immediately met with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax for three-quarters of an hour. It is reported that he presented a pessimistic report on the situation in Germany and the intentions of the German government. The Cabinet held a small group meeting at the Prime Minister's residence, attended by Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon, First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Stanhope, Lord Chancellor Sir Inskip, Minister for Coordination of Defence Lord Chatfield, First Lord of the Admiralty, President of the Board of Trade Stanley, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cadogan, and Government Industrial Advisor Sir Wilson. It is reported that the discussions focused on two key aspects: intensifying military expansion and collectively resisting Germany's expansionist policy. They also considered holding a conference of Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey to formulate a common policy to address new aggressions. It is also reported that Foreign Secretary Halifax and President of the Board of Trade Stanley meticulously studied whether economic sanctions could be imposed on Germany. King George VI returned to London at 5:00 PM, and Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately entered the palace at 6:00 PM for an audience, where he reported on the international situation. He did not leave until 7:00 PM. Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax before the small group meeting of the Cabinet, delivering a copy of the Soviet note to Germany and informing him that although the Soviet Union was disappointed after the Munich Agreement, it was still prepared to participate in collective action to prevent Germany from expanding its power. Regarding this, London political circles say that the British government has now decided to approach the Soviet Union and wants to unite the countries of Northeast and Southeast Europe to form a defensive line to resist Germany. (Havas, 19th)

(London) The Cabinet decided yesterday that Britain should immediately contact all peace-loving countries in the world to respond to the situation, and decided to accelerate the completion of Britain's military expansion plan with maximum effort, and scheduled to hold another meeting this morning. At the same time, Britain and France are preparing everything so that they will not be caught off guard if Germany takes further action. Non-official circles advocate that Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union hold a conference to formulate a grand strategy, and invite the Balkan countries to join. It is reported that when British Foreign Secretary Halifax received Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky today, he discussed the possibility of cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union for half an hour. Prime Minister Chamberlain was quite busy today, receiving Foreign Secretary Halifax, Secretary of State for Air Wood, and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Inskip in the morning. In the afternoon, he again received Halifax and President of the Board of Trade Stanley. At 5:50 PM, he drove to Buckingham Palace to meet with the King, where he reported on the latest developments in the European situation for more than an hour before returning to his residence. Chamberlain also held a meeting with cabinet members related to national defense today.

(London) After the Cabinet holds another meeting this morning, an announcement will be made in both the House of Lords and the House of Commons in the afternoon. People across the country expect that British foreign policy will change. The Times stated that in Europe today, only force is valued, and everything else is insufficient. Britain has never approved of the policy of encircling Germany, but Germany's own policies have now made encirclement a natural and inevitable method. This statement can largely represent British public opinion. The Daily Telegraph stated that the policy that Britain will adopt will inevitably require Britain to assume new obligations elsewhere. (Reuters, 20th)

(London) Opposition leader Attlee asked the Prime Minister in the House of Commons today to express his opinion on the European situation. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that his speech in Birmingham on March 17 had expressed the government's serious views on the events of the past week. The European situation is currently receiving the government's urgent attention. The British government is now exchanging information with other governments, and he will make a more detailed statement in the House of Commons at the earliest possible opportunity. (Reuters, 20th)

It is generally believed that the Soviet government will soon submit a formal answer. (Havas, 19th)

### Hitler Returns to Berlin: Enthusiastic Welcome

Göring Says the German Nation Vows Never to Give Up Bloody Loot

Berlin Hitler returned here by train at 6:30 this afternoon. At that time, the cheers and military horns in the station were deafening. General Göring, along with the entire cabinet, senior administrative officials, leaders of the National Socialist Party from various districts, and military party delegations, stood on the platform to welcome him. Inside and outside the station, swastika flags were hung everywhere. The roads that Hitler passed after leaving the station were crowded with people, and the scene was rare. Göring gave a speech welcoming Hitler, saying that the Führer not only restored the past glory of the German nation but also placed Germany on a solid foundation. This is a day for the Führer to be proud of. Now, in the name of the German nation, he solemnly swore that he would never give up the great achievements he had won. He could not express his gratitude to the Führer in any other way. Such a heroic soldier would never be without a heroic nation behind him. The Führer has made this nation courageous and great. After Göring finished speaking, the crowd saluted Hitler, who then left the station and returned to the Chancellery by car. The crowds along the way stood like walls, cheering loudly. Every few distances, there was a military band stationed. From the station to the Chancellery, there were as many as 50 military bands stationed. The searchlights of the Chancellery shone brightly, as bright as day. Hitler's car drove very slowly. After entering the Chancellery, the crowd gathered in front of the door cheered and asked him to come to the balcony. Hitler appeared three times, and the last time he declared that he could not come out again because he had to have important talks. At that time, the crowd on Wilhelmstrasse was in a frenzy and broke through the cordon of the party army three times. The leaders of the German churches ordered all churches to ring their bells from 6:45 PM to 7:00 PM. (Reuters, 19th)

### Göring to Visit Italy Again Today

(Berlin) It is reported that General Göring will visit Italy again tomorrow to continue his interrupted vacation. This indicates that the German Reichstag will not be convened for a while. It is believed that General Göring will meet with Mussolini. (Reuters, 20th)

### Anglo-German Naval Agreement: Germany Also to Abolish

(London) News revealed by political figures in Berlin said that Germany would abolish the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. All newspapers here published it this morning, but did not comment. Only the News Chronicle published a short comment saying that if Germany implements this move, it will inevitably restore the state of Anglo-German naval arms race planned by Tirpitz before the war. (Haitong, 20th)

(Berlin) Since Britain's attitude towards Germany has become firm, German newspapers have criticized Britain more and more fiercely, even without avoiding threats, and openly advocated abolishing the Anglo-German Naval Treaty of 1935. According to this treaty, the total tonnage of the German Navy shall not exceed 35% of the total tonnage of the British Navy. (Havas, 20th)

### Gibraltar: Naval Defense Strengthened

(London) The 33,000-ton battleship "Repulse" has sailed from the British mainland to the port of Gibraltar. According to official explanations, when King George VI inspects the Canadian Federation in May of this year, he will use the "Repulse" as his flagship for the first trial voyage. However, after this ship arrives in the port of Gibraltar, the strength of the British Mediterranean Fleet will greatly increase. This is an obvious fact. (Havas, 20th)

Gibraltar Officials here issued a notice today recruiting British people to join the local air defense team. (Reuters, 20th)

### Czechs Rise Up: Begin to Resist Germany

Increasing Suicides and Thousands Arrested; Beneš Announces Fight for Independence

Prague It is reported that the number of people arrested and suicides here is increasing. Czech police, under the direction of the German secret police, have arrested thousands of residents, most of whom are German refugees from Austria and the Sudetenland, political figures, and journalists. The president of the Polish News Agency is also among those arrested. The Polish ambassador to Berlin has already intervened. No Jews have been reported arrested so far. According to the Czech News Agency, a bomb was thrown into the residence of the German leader in the Těšín area, about 35 miles outside Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. No injuries were reported. A German was also thrown a bomb in the street, but was not injured. (Reuters, 20th)

Chicago It was rumored that Dr. Edvard Beneš, the former President of Czechoslovakia, intended to organize a temporary government within the United States. Dr. Beneš himself has denied this. He stated that it was too early to say so. He then gave a radio address, saying, "Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia is a crime and will undoubtedly be punished by God in the future. If this kind of crime is not punished, there will be no peace and order in the world. In fact, war has already broken out in Europe. The humanitarian values of Britain, France, Scandinavia, and the Balkan Peninsula have been threatened, as have those of other countries around the world." He concluded by saying, "I vow to fight to the end for the independence of Czechoslovakia." (Havas, 19th)

(New York) Well-informed Czech sources here have stated that Dr. Edvard Beneš, the former President of Czechoslovakia, intends to establish a temporary government within the United States, which is expected to be recognized by the United States and major democratic countries in Europe. Czech consuls in various parts of the United States and dignitaries residing in the United States are willing to support this move. (Havas, 19th)

(London) The Daily Herald recently reported that "After Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the British government has ordered that all cash and securities deposited by Czechs in British banks be prohibited from being transferred. At the same time, the U.S. government has also taken the same measures, totaling £65 million. From this estimate, the overseas funds that Germany has seized from the Czechs should not exceed £35 million." (Havas, 20th)

Editorial

### The United States Holds the Most Powerful Weapon

The rampages of fascist aggressors have created an atmosphere of international chaos and unease, but at the same time, they have also spurred the gradual awakening of peaceful democratic countries. Ever since Hitler annihilated Czechoslovakia in three days with lightning speed, even Chamberlain, who had been working himself to the bone to compromise, felt the urgency of the fascist threat and had a tendency to try to get closer to the United States and the Soviet Union to jointly resist Germany. Of course, it is too early to say that the ruling classes of Britain and France will abandon their consistent policy of "appeasement" today and adopt a firm anti-aggression stance; however, the growing cohesion and firmness of the peace front under the serious threat of fascism is an undeniable fact. In recent days, we have seen the efforts of small countries in Southeast Europe to "precariously seek self-preservation," and we have long seen the active activities of diplomats in London. But equally worthy of our attention is that the United States, which has a very active anti-aggression attitude, is using calm labor to promote the unity and consolidation of the peace front. After Hitler's military invasion of Czechoslovakia, U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles first issued a statement condemning Germany's illegal actions, and then President Roosevelt also told reporters that he would soon propose amending the Neutrality Act "to curb the tide of aggression." At the same time, the U.S. government also declared that, in retaliation for Germany's aggression in Europe and its economic penetration into the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. government had decided to implement a "punitive tax" on German imports. Congress expects the government to use this means of sanction against Japan and other countries that violate the treaty. The increasingly active anti-aggression attitude of the United States is enough to promote the development of the peace front; if the United States can earnestly apply economic pressure to fascist countries, it will be enough to make fascist countries tremble with fear, and even lead to their demise.

The United States holds the most powerful economic weapon, and she can indeed "use methods other than war" to make it impossible for aggressors to invade. For example, according to Janeway's estimate, the United States can produce 72 million tons of steel each year, while the combined output of all countries in the world other than the United States is less than 76 million tons. If the United States unites with all democratic countries, whether this force can be compared with the fascist group that "started by extortion" can be understood by looking at the point mentioned above. Since "extortion" has developed into a political weapon, world trade has also been restricted by "autarky." Europe is the United States' largest buyer, but now it is not buying food and commercial raw materials. The deepening crisis of American agriculture is precisely the result of this. Now, what Europe and Asia need most are machinery and military raw materials, and the United States is constantly exporting them, helping the fascists turn the people into cannon fodder.

The current policy of the United States is indeed too helpful to the fascists. Former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson has tried his best to oppose it. The famous reporter Janeway even loudly exclaimed that "The war in China is our baby!" True, without the supply of the United States, Japan would simply be unable to invade China. More than 90% of the oil and copper used by Japan is supplied by the United States. Secondly, Japan also purchases a large number of machines from the United States. Japan itself cannot manufacture machines. Nor can she get them from her Berlin ally. In 1937, her imports of machinery from Germany were six times that of the United States, but in 1938, Germany refused to sell to Japan because it was not enough for its own use. Now, 75% of the machines used by Japan are imported from the United States.

The same is true for Germany. Another American reporter, Voggen, wrote an article entitled "We Built the Nazi Air Force," pointing out that the establishment of Germany's air force today relies almost entirely on the supply of the United States for raw materials. The oil produced in Germany can only meet half of its needs, and the quality is not good. In order to improve the quality of the oil, she is purchasing the best oil refining machines from the United States. It is no wonder that Janeway said: "If Hitler succeeds in invading Europe, the United States will be responsible."

From the brief description above, it can be seen how deeply the fascist aggressor countries rely on the United States economically. Without the material support of the United States, the machine of aggression cannot be started. The United States really holds the most powerful weapon to control the aggressor countries.

At present, the situation of the aggressors' challenge is expanding, and the United States, in view of the seriousness of the threats it faces, is increasingly actively calling on the world's peaceful forces to fight against aggression. This is certainly gratifying, but it is not enough. We hope that the wise President Roosevelt can lead his people to further take out the most powerful economic weapons, unite with democratic countries such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and jointly give the fascist aggressors a fatal blow.

### U.S. Senate to Discuss Amendment to Neutrality Act Today; Public Opinion Unanimously Believes It Can Be Passed and Economic Sanctions Will Be Imposed on Japan

(Washington) According to a senior official who told the Associated Press today, after the domestic public has clearly expressed its policy towards Germany, the United States may impose trade sanctions on Japan, the scope of which may be broader than those against Germany, because Japan's discrimination against the United States is indirectly even worse than Germany's discrimination against the United States. Germany directly subsidizes exports to the United States, while Japan does not directly subsidize exports to the United States, but there is extreme discrimination against American goods in "Manchukuo" and North China. In a note from the U.S. State Department to the Japanese government on October 6 last year, the discrimination against U.S. trade by Japan in "Manchukuo" and North China was specifically listed. Japan has not yet responded to this note. The U.S. tariff bill authorizes the president to act conveniently when a foreign country directly or indirectly discriminates against the commercial interests of the United States. (Associated Press, 19th)

(Washington) Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman is scheduled to submit a new Neutrality Act to Congress today, advocating that the president be authorized to designate belligerent countries within 30 days after the outbreak of war and extend the "cash and carry" clause to all kinds of goods (including munitions). He gave a radio address last night, explaining the contents of this bill, saying, "If the totalitarian countries continue to expand, the whole world will encounter a critical situation, and the United States will be no exception. Our country must take action to prepare for the worst. The purpose of the new Neutrality Act that I have proposed is not to expand the president's privileges. The policy pursued by the United States focuses on maintaining existing treaties and respecting promises. Looking around the world, the only major countries that can support this policy are Britain and France." (Havas, 20th)

(Washington) Political figures here are commenting on the new Neutrality Act proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman, saying that this new Neutrality Act intends to extend the "cash and carry" clause in the current Neutrality Act from all kinds of goods to munitions, and the impact may be beneficial to Japan, which is not necessarily the case, because the international situation is so serious that the goal of the new Neutrality Act is to provide only the best quality military supplies and food to Britain and France in the event of a war in Europe. Therefore, although its purpose is not to give Japan any convenience, because Japan is one of the world's great naval powers and has a large number of merchant ships, it can make full use of it to purchase only the best quality munitions and raw materials from the United States. Although this is not in line with the spirit of the new Neutrality Act, it may be temporarily accommodated because there is no way to have both. It is expected that when this new Neutrality Act is submitted to the Senate for discussion tomorrow afternoon, there will be no major disagreements among the senators, but Senator Johnson, a Republican from California, Senator Nye, a Republican from North Dakota (who wants to prohibit the transport of munitions to foreign countries in both peacetime and wartime), and Senator Reynolds, a Democrat from North Carolina, may speak out in opposition, while Senator Vandenberg, a Republican from Michigan, and Senator Clark, a Democrat from Missouri, will defend it. As for President Roosevelt, he has already clearly expressed his approval of this bill, and his views on the European situation are supported by most senators. In addition, there is one more thing that is very important, that is, Senate Republican Leader Taft recently gave a speech saying, "I approve of a large-scale military expansion plan, especially the training of a strong air force, so that the United States can cope with all incidents in this turbulent international situation." Therefore, it can be inferred that this new Neutrality Act will be passed by the Senate. (Havas, 19th)

(Chongqing) The Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression League recently received a U.S. news report, which stated that American citizens attitude towards amending the Neutrality Act. Religious organizations such as the United World Church Friendship Alliance and seven other groups, women's organizations such as the Association of University Women and seven other groups, labor organizations such as the Ironworkers Committee and twelve other groups, and five peace organizations such as the Association for Cooperation in Promoting Peace have all resolved to advocate amending the Neutrality Act, and it is necessary to distinguish between aggressor countries and victims of aggression, and the embargo on munitions and raw materials should be applied to aggressor countries. When Professor Shotwell from Columbia University gave a lecture at Carnegie Hall in New York, he criticized the Neutrality Act, saying, "This bill not only fails to distinguish between aggressors and victims of aggression, but also helps the wicked and harms friendly countries." Bishop Oldham of Albany also believed at a lecture organized by the Association for Cooperation in Promoting Peace that "the Neutrality Act is the result of the confusion or suspicion and fear of the old political leaders of the United States. In this world where all parts are closely related, mentioning isolation is suspected of dishonesty." (20th)

### Arita and Saionji Discuss Important Issues

(Tokyo) The Kokumin Shimbun reported today that Foreign Minister Arita, acting on the orders of Prime Minister Hiranuma, visited elder statesman Saionji yesterday morning to present important foreign policy issues and seek the elder's opinion. After the meeting, he returned to Tokyo and immediately met with War Minister Itagaki to report on the results of his conversation with Saionji. Observers generally regard Arita's visit as extremely important, as it is rare for the Foreign Minister to visit an elder statesman. It is believed that the Cabinet is hesitant to make a decision on a certain special issue and therefore seeks the elder's opinion. The "special issue" likely concerns the dispute over Japanese-Soviet fishing rights or the strengthening of the Anti-Comintern Pact. (Reuters, 20th)

(Tokyo) Today, a foreign correspondent asked the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman about rumors of a military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. The spokesman replied that he could not comment on such rumors. The Diet has been discussing the need to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact. When asked whether the national sentiment in Japan in favor of strengthening relations with Germany and Italy had already led to a military alliance, and whether he could deny or confirm the rumors of a military alliance between the three countries, the spokesman replied that it was not a question of denying or confirming. He pointed out that Japan's attitude toward the Anti-Comintern Pact had been clearly stated and remained unchanged. (Reuters, 20th)

(Tokyo) Today, a foreign correspondent asked the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman whether the situation in Europe would have any repercussions in East Asia. The spokesman replied that it was too early to make any predictions. The correspondent also asked, given rumors that the Communists had established a base of operations in Romania, whether Japan, as a signatory to the Anti-Comintern Pact, would assist Germany should it initiate action against the Communists in Romania. The spokesman replied that Japan would cooperate with Germany in anti-communist actions, but that it was still doubtful whether the situation would develop as the correspondent suggested. (Reuters, 20th)

(Tokyo) Today, the Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that the Japanese-Soviet fishery negotiations were unlikely to be affected by the situation in Europe. He added that the negotiations would resume in Moscow, but the exact date was not yet known. (Reuters, 20th)

### Japan: Currency Inflation

(Chongqing) Ms. Atlee, a famous British journalist and editor of the "Far East Dispatch," stated in its fourth issue: The number of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan was originally limited to 120 million yen, but after the invasion of China, it increased to 1 billion yen. Recently, it has become uncontrollable, reaching a staggering 2.2 billion, 1 million yen. Furthermore, the ambitious military leaders are requesting the Diet to increase the issuance to 2.7 billion, 1 million yen. At the same time, gold reserves have decreased significantly (falling by 200 million yen). There is a constant need to transport huge amounts of exports to maintain the credit of public bonds. The approaching collapse of Japanese finances reinforces the belief of the Chinese that, even with slightly inferior armaments, resistance to the end will ultimately lead to victory. (Telegram, 20th)

### Junkers Aircraft Sets New Record

(Berlin) A German Junkers bomber, carrying a load of 2,000 kilograms, achieved a speed of 517 kilometers per hour during a 1,000-kilometer flight, setting a new world record. (Havas, 20th)

### Hungary Mobilizes, Romania Deploys Defenses, Poland Intends to Mediate, German-Romanian Economic Talks May Succeed

Capital of Hungary: The Hungarian government is continuing to mobilize its army in an orderly manner. It is expected that the entire mobilization will be completed by the 28th of this month. (Havas, 20th)

Capital of Hungary: Although the entire region of Carpatho-Ukraine has been occupied by Hungarian troops, trains fully loaded with troops are still departing for the region. A train leaves every three hours. Not only is the Hungarian capital bustling with activity, but so is the area along the border between Hungary and former Czechoslovakia. Young men conscripted into the army are now entering camps for service. Villagers are using mules and carts to transport hay and straw to the camps. (Reuters, 19th)

Capital of Romania: Romanian troops are rapidly advancing towards the Carpatho-Ukraine and Hungarian borders. The main northwestern roads are blocked by troops. Although officials claim that a general mobilization order has not been issued, a large number of young men have indeed been conscripted, numbering between 90,000 and 100,000. This is due to the tense general situation and rumors that German troops are advancing through Czechoslovakia toward Carpatho-Ukraine, which necessitates vigilance. If this rumor is true, then German troops would be stationed on the Romanian border. However, the atmosphere in Romania is now more relaxed. It is reported that the government's talks with the German economic delegation are expected to lead to an agreement on Tuesday, which will be far less severe than the rumored German economic demands. (Reuters, 19th)

Capital of Romania: It is reported that both Romania and Hungary have conscripted new soldiers and are deploying heavy forces to Carpatho-Ukraine. It is estimated that approximately 100,000 troops are being deployed to the Romanian border. The Hungarian troops stationed in Munkács have been greatly increased. (Reuters, 20th)

Warsaw: It is reported that Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck is currently working to reconcile the interests of Hungary and Romania, as Hungary is an old friend of Poland, and Romania is an ally. Public opinion here condemns Germany's actions in Czechoslovakia. The entire nation is determined to resist any violation of Polish borders. It is reported that the troop strength along the Polish border has been increased. (Reuters, 20th)

### Nordic Countries Seek Neutrality

Capital of Norway: After members of the British Parliament recently issued a statement saying that Britain deeply desires to guarantee the independence of the Scandinavian Peninsula countries and other small countries, Norwegian Parliament Speaker Hambro commented on it at a political gathering last night, saying, "We appreciate the sympathy of other countries for the Nordic countries, but we have neither requested guarantees nor do we hope that any one country or any number of countries will guarantee our country's security in any form." "I personally have never believed in promises of security. Every country can only maintain its security by relying on its own strength and by helping Europe promote the concept of security." (Havas, 20th)

### German Troops Request Passage Through Hungary

Capital of Hungary: It is reported that Hungary, Germany, and Romania are currently conducting separate, important negotiations. This is due to a request from the German side to the Hungarian government to allow German troops to pass through its territory in the event of war. Opinions within the Hungarian government are divided on this matter, falling into two factions: one faction advocates accepting Germany's request, while the other advocates forming an agreement with Romania, so that Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's "European Third Axis" can be realized. (Havas, 20th)

### Promotion of Relations Between Turkey and Bulgaria

Capital of Turkey: After Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov came here and held talks with Turkish officials, the first official statement was issued last night, stating that Turkish-Bulgarian friendship and the independent policies pursued by the Balkan countries are the two major factors in maintaining and promoting peace in Europe. A second communiqué was also issued stating that with the European situation changing rapidly, Turkish and Bulgarian authorities are keenly aware that maintaining close relations among the Balkan countries, pursuing independent and autonomous policies, and promoting common policies can not only safeguard peace in this corner of Europe, but also safeguard peace in the entire Europe. Therefore, they will maintain historical norms, consult each other on issues related to common interests, and especially maintain peace. Both sides are pleased that the existing friendly nature of their diplomatic relations will be further consolidated by Prime Minister Kyoseivanov's visit. (Havas, 20th)

### Poland Determined to Uphold Independence

Warsaw: Today is the anniversary of the late Minister of Military Affairs Marshal Piłsudski. President Mościcki held a reception at the presidential palace for the entire cabinet and leaders from all walks of life and delivered a speech, stating, in brief, that the Polish nation is determined to defend its independence and will not allow other countries to oppress it. The international situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the entire nation must be prepared to make sacrifices. "The policy we pursue is one of independence and autonomy. We lay the foundations of the nation with our own strength, and we are unwilling to entrust our country's fate to the hands of foreigners. Our country's fate is based on the continuous work of the entire nation. We are always prepared to sacrifice in order to ensure the independence of the nation." (Havas, 19th)

### French Government Decides to Implement Full Powers Act; Half of Soldiers Completing Service Next Month to Remain in Camp; Technical Personnel to be Conscripted

(Paris) The cabinet met tonight from 6:50 PM to 8:45 PM. The Full Powers Act will be implemented immediately. It is reported that half of the soldiers scheduled to be discharged from military service in April of this year will remain in camp.

Although officials have not yet confirmed this, it is widely believed that some technical personnel will be drafted. (Reuters, 19th)

(Paris) After the Full Powers Act is enacted, the cabinet is scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting this afternoon to discuss ways to strengthen national defense in the military, political, and economic spheres. First, a substitute legal order will be passed on the economic front to save expenditures. In addition, according to various newspapers, the main measures that the government intends to take first are as follows: (1) Maximize the production and storage of military equipment; (2) Factories related to national defense industries should increase their working hours to more than 40 hours per week; (3) Provide various forms of assistance to national defense industries; (4) Suppress "false news" issued by newspapers and radio stations.

### American Public Opinion is Outraged

(New York) After Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the outrage of the American people is comparable to that of 1914 when Germany violated Belgian neutrality. Therefore, sympathy for the British, French, and Czech people is evident in various public places. Previously, when newsreels were shown in movie theaters, the audience would boo every time British Prime Minister Chamberlain appeared on the screen. However, since Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham condemning Germany's actions a few days ago, the boos have been replaced by applause. Most movie theaters are also showing newsreels from around the Munich Conference in September, which give the audience a deep sense of recollection. In this newsreel, former Czech President Beneš inspects the air force in front of the Hradčany Palace (i.e., the presidential palace). These air force personnel at the time thought that they would soon be going to the border to defend against foreign invasion. American audiences were greatly moved by this scene. When German troops were seen parading in formation with a "goose step" in the Sudetenland, the audience shouted loudly to express their opposition. The depth of American public opinion's aversion to Germany can be seen from this. (Havas, 20th)

### The Great Southwest Transportation Network is Under Continuous and Diligent Construction; Railway and Highway Intertwined; Construction Costs Mostly From British and American Loans

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the great transportation network planned in the Southwest is now under continuous and diligent construction. The new railway lines, up to 2,500 miles long, can be completed by 1941. The construction costs mostly comes from British and American loans, and the materials are also mostly supplied by countries such as the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. One line connects the Yuehan Railway to the north and reaches the border of Annam to the south, in other words, starting from Hengzhou in the north and reaching Zhennanguan on the Guangxi border in the south. Another line is the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and the third line is the railway from Kunming to Yibin in Sichuan. Yibin is 140 miles southwest of Chongqing, and the distance to Chengdu is the same. The Ministry of Communications plans to complete the railway from Yibin to Chongqing and Chengdu within two years, so that Sichuan can be directly connected to the Yunnan-Vietnam and Yunnan-Burma railways. As for the transportation lines connecting Hunan, Guizhou, and Guizhou and Yunnan, they will soon be completed, because the section from Zhuzhou to Guilin, a total of 621 kilometers, has now been completed, and the roadbed from Guiyang to Kunming is also under construction. In addition to railways, highways are also under vigorous construction. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance against Japan, 1,990 miles of southwest highways have been completed, one is the Yunnan-Burma line, and the other is the Gansu-Xinjiang line. The former is 725 miles long, from Kunming to Lashio in Burma, and the latter is 1,540 miles long, from Lanzhou in Gansu to Dihua in Xinjiang. As for the original highway from Dihua to Yili, this line can directly reach the Soviet Union after completion. Since the outbreak of the Chinese War of Resistance, there have been 5,000 trucks imported from abroad. Currently, the average daily cargo transported on the Kunming-Yibin line is about 100 tons. In terms of waterways, efforts have also been made to ensure smooth flow in the past three months. The current plan of the Ministry of Communications is to open up the transportation between the Xiangjiang River and the Guijiang River. According to Xiang and Gui, the two rivers were originally connected, and they can be opened up by slightly dredging them. Once this road is opened, it is possible to sail directly from Hunan to Guangdong, because the Guijiang River and the Xijiang River in Guangdong are connected. (20th Associated Press)

### Soviet Russia Does Not Recognize Germany's Annexation of Czechoslovakia, Listing Six Reasons

(Moscow) The German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, on the 16th, upon orders from his government, notified the Soviet government that Germany had concluded a so-called agreement on the 14th, placing the Czech people under German national protection. The next day, the ambassador sent a note to the Soviet government, notifying them of the contents of the German head of state's order to establish a protectorate in Bohemia and Moravia.

Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov sent the following reply to the ambassador, stating,

"Your Excellency's notes of the 16th and 17th of this month, notifying of the German Empire's annexation of Czechoslovakia and Germany's establishment of a protectorate in Czechoslovakia, have been received. In response to the above-mentioned notes, in order to avoid creating the erroneous impression that our government is indifferent to the Czechoslovakian incident, the Soviet government cannot remain silent, and hereby expresses our government's true attitude towards the above-mentioned incident as follows, as a reply:

First, the political and historical views expressed in the first paragraph of the German announcement as its basis and reasons, especially the statement that the existence of the Czechoslovakian state is a source of constant disturbance and threat to European peace, and that Czechoslovakia lacks vitality and therefore requires the special protection of the German Empire, cannot be considered consistent with the correct facts recognized by the world. In fact, since the First World War, the Czechoslovakian Republic has indeed been one of the few European countries with internal peace and truly implementing a policy of external peace.

"Second, the Soviet government has never heard of any clause in any country's constitution that authorizes the head of state to declare the cancellation of the country's independence without the consent of the people. It is difficult to believe that any nation would voluntarily cancel its independence and merge into another country, especially with regard to a nation that has fought for independence for hundreds of years and has recently been independent for twenty years. Accordingly, the signing of the Berlin Treaty by the President of Czechoslovakia on the 15th of this month has not been approved by the people of the country, and therefore clearly violates Articles 64 and 65 of the Czechoslovakian Constitution. Therefore, the above-mentioned treaty cannot be considered legally valid.

"Third, the principle of national self-determination often cited by the German government includes the free expression of the people's will. This expression cannot be replaced by the signature of one or two people, no matter how high their position. In this incident, there was no expression of the will of the Czech people, not even in the form of a referendum as was used to decide on Silesia and the Sarre region.

"Fourth, since the Czech people did not express any will, the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the German army and the subsequent actions of the German government can only be regarded as arbitrary, violent, and aggressive acts.

"Fifth, with regard to the subsequent change of national status of Slovakia and its vassalage to the German Empire, since the Slovak people also did not express any will, the above comments should also apply in full.

"Sixth, the actions of the German government are also a signal for the barbaric invasion of Carpatho-Ruthenia by Hungarian troops, violating the basic rights of its people.

"Seventh, for the above-mentioned reasons, the Soviet government cannot recognize the incorporation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the German Empire in any form as legal, in accordance with generally accepted standards of international law and justice, or the principle of national self-determination.

"Eighth, in the opinion of the Soviet government, the actions of the German government not only cannot eliminate any threat to universal peace, but on the contrary, have created and aggravated this threat, undermining the political stability of Central Europe, increasing the anxiety already created in Europe, and once again striking at the sense of security of all peoples. "The above points are respectfully submitted to your government for transmittal." (19th TASS)

### Chinese Air Force Repeatedly Makes Surprise Attacks, Japanese Troops in Guangzhou are Panicked

Hong Kong Correspondence: It has been raining continuously in recent days, and the weather in Guangdong has been mostly cloudy and less sunny. The Chinese army has also prepared for the counter-offensive military operations, sending the air force to bomb the Japanese army's positions, destroying their artillery emplacements, and then launching fierce attacks with infantry units. According to those who have just escaped from Guangzhou, on the morning of the 15th, a small squadron of the new Chinese Air Force was discovered in the sky over the northeast suburbs of Guangzhou, at an altitude of approximately 8,000 feet. They then flew to the vicinity of the Tianhe Airport and circled around. Japanese aircraft hurriedly took off to engage them. The Chinese aircraft then dropped six or seven large bombs on the Tianhe Airport, and a fire immediately broke out inside the airport, with thick smoke billowing. At this time, several Japanese aircraft had already taken off, but were controlled by the Chinese squadron and dared not venture out far. With their mission accomplished, the Chinese squadron calmly flew west. When the Chinese aircraft dropped bombs, the Japanese anti-aircraft artillery fired indiscriminately, with rumbling sounds lasting for dozens of minutes, but they ultimately failed to stop the air raid. On the 16th, the Chinese squadron flew to the near suburbs again, threatening the Japanese troops near the eastern suburbs and Conghua. After repeated air raids, the Japanese army in Guangzhou declared martial law and dispatched more puppet troops to defend key points in the urban area, with particularly strict inspections of travelers. The Japanese army and the puppet maintenance committee in Guangzhou have recently repeatedly telegraphed for reinforcements, claiming that the Chinese army is planning to encircle Guangzhou. On the 17th, two Japanese ships, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, entered the port from Humen and were transferred to the northeast to strengthen defenses, and shallow-water warships were dispatched to the Xijiang and Dongjiang rivers to assist the Japanese army on land in vigilance. Currently, there are about 50 Japanese rubber boats and about 2,000 Japanese and Taiwanese soldiers distributed in the areas of the mouth of the Xijiang River in Sanshui, Xinxu, Mian, Ganggen, etc. There has been no change in the Japanese army in the Jiujiang area. The Japanese army in the Foshan area recently gathered more than 1,000 people, led by Yitian, and on the 14th, they advanced along the Bijiang to Daliang Highway, invading Daliang and using bandits as guides to attack Shunde City, occupying the Shunde Public Office. Japanese soldiers and bandits took the opportunity to rob wealthy households in the areas of Daliang Zhu Yuanli, Wenxiu Bridge, Bazha, and Huagai Li, and ordered the shops on Bijian Road, Hua Street, and Huagai Road to resume business. Then, another team of soldiers advanced along the Rongliang Highway to spy on Shatou Township. It is heard that the Japanese army's harassment in the Rongqi Daliang area was because they had detected that a certain guerrilla unit was active in the area. Therefore, after occupying Daliang, they also ravaged Shatou, and then built temporary defensive works in Shatou and erected small steel cannons to prevent the guerrillas on the opposite bank from copying out from Rongqi Guizhou. Since the Japanese army occupied Shatou, the road from the southern suburbs of Guangzhou through Pingzhou Shunde to Hong Kong and Macao has been blocked. It happened that the Gangyue Jinshan Company's transport ship sailed from Guangzhou to Hong Kong at 4:00 p.m. on the 16th, so the number of passengers increased sharply.

### Guilin's Market is Booming, Wuzhou is Declining

Guangxi Correspondence: Wuzhou is the only large commercial port in Guangxi. Its upstream can directly reach Guiliu, Yongyu, and its downstream can directly connect to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Ships gather and transportation is convenient, so it is the general hub for the import and export of goods. After the fall of Guangzhou, the lower reaches of the Pearl River were blocked, and the transportation of import and export goods in Guangxi Province was completely suspended. As a result, the market environment of the entire province changed along with the transportation routes. In the border areas, such as Taiping and Longzhou, due to their geographical proximity to Annam, most of the goods are gathered in Longzhou, and are transported in and out through the Vietnam Railway, from the Zhennanguan side. In the central part, in the Nanning, Xunzhou, and Yulin areas, due to their proximity to the southern route of Guangdong Province, they are transshipped by land, with Beihai or Guangzhou Bay on the southern route as the import and export points. In the Wuzhou area of eastern Guangxi, most goods are transported downstream to Zhaoqing, and then via the land route of Gaoming Heshan, through the waterway of Jiangmen Shiqi, until the export at Qianshan. The import is also the same. However, the above-mentioned transportation, with its twists and turns by water and land, and its winding roads, is extremely difficult for general transportation merchants. Until the end of last year, the section of the railway from Hengyang to Guilin was completed, and it was possible to travel directly from Hunan to Guilin. The authorities took the opportunity to develop the economy of the southwest to support the long-term war of resistance, and then sought to directly connect the Zhejiang and Guangxi provinces. At present, the imported goods needed by Guangxi Province, such as wool and cotton fabrics, paper, cigarettes, and cosmetics, come directly from Jinhua, but indirectly from Wenzhou and Ningbo. Since the opening of the Zhejiang-Guangxi railway, the business in Guilin has temporarily flourished. Merchants from Liuzhou, Qingyuan, and Pingle, who used to go to Wuzhou to purchase goods, have now turned to the Guilin market. As a result, the business in Wuzhou has plummeted. Moreover, Wuzhou is often bombed by airplanes, and the import and export offices, having no business to operate in Wuzhou, have moved to Guilin to start businesses. Three months ago, the prices of goods in Guilin (referring to imported goods) were often 30% to 40% higher than those in Wuzhou. Now, the prices in Guilin are lower than those in Wuzhou, and there are various daily necessities that are available in Guilin but not in Wuzhou. This is because the transportation situation has changed, and the market environment has also changed greatly. After the start of the second phase of the War of Resistance, Guilin became the center of military, political, and economic activity in the southwest, so the liveliness of its market has also progressed by leaps and bounds.

### Zhejiang Province Fisheries Ravaged

Dinghai Correspondence: The Zhoushan Archipelago in eastern Zhejiang consists of numerous islands, scattered like stars. In total, there are over two hundred islands. Among them, the waters near Liheng, Daishan, Taohua, Qushan, Changtu, and Putuo Islands are particularly rich in fish, with a total fishing area of 28,800 nautical miles, making it a major fishing ground for our country. In the past, approximately 4,000 large fishing boats, 5,000 medium-sized boats, and over 1,000 small boats from the Zhoushan Archipelago set sail annually, totaling more than 12,000 fishing boats of all sizes. Excluding the guest fishermen, local fishing boats numbered around 4,000. Each boat, during a good harvest, could catch tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of catties of fish. In poor harvests, they caught a few thousand to a few hundred catties, varying accordingly. Averaging at 8,000 catties, it yields about 30 million catties of fish. The catch consists mostly of yellow croaker (also known as stone fish), followed by cutlassfish, shark, ribbonfish, and cuttlefish. The usual price ranges from two cents to two dimes per catty, averaging at seven cents. The annual income amounts to two million national currency. Wartime Fisheries: Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the Zhoushan Archipelago has been at the forefront of national defense. Japanese warships constantly patrol the waters. At best, they rob fishermen of their property. At worst, they destroy boats and kill people. The various tragic events are truly beyond description. Due to the fear of the brutality of Japanese warships, fishermen generally refrain from setting sail. However, compelled by hunger and cold, they have no choice but to risk going out to sea sporadically. Recently, pirates have been rampant, with gangs led by figures such as Wang Pinxiong and Pan Zhaocai, who possess large numbers of men and guns, causing particularly severe harm. In February of this year alone, more than thirty fishing boats were robbed, fourteen fishermen were killed, and more than thirty were abducted without a trace. Loss Assessment: According to the recent statistics from the Fisheries Management Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, since the start of the Anti-Japanese War, the direct losses to the Zhoushan Archipelago's fisheries amount to 145,950 national currency. The lives of fishermen lost due to being burned to death aboard their boats by Japanese warships, being abandoned on deserted islands, or being thrown into the sea and starving or drowning, are estimated at more than 150 people. Indirect losses are estimated at 2,061,302 national currency. The total losses amount to 2,207,232 national currency. Furthermore, the dried products produced in the Zhoushan Archipelago, such as dried mantis shrimp, are worth 2 million national currency annually. With the fall of Guangzhou, sales channels were cut off, resulting in a loss of 1 million national currency for this item alone.

### The Southwestern Military Conference Determines to Seize the Initiative in the Second Phase of the War, Strengthen Political Institutions, Adjust Personnel, and Decides to Implement a Scorched Earth Policy Economically

Guangxi Correspondence: Since the Sino-Japanese War shifted from the Northeast to the Southwest, generals throughout the country have become increasingly invigorated. All troops at the front and in the rear have been reorganized. As a result, the military has entered a new phase of the second stage. Because the center of gravity of the war is in the Southwest, the Central Supreme Military Headquarters has specially established an Executive Headquarters in Guilin, appointing General Bai Chongxi as the director, granting him full authority to coordinate and plan. At the beginning of the establishment of the Executive Headquarters, Bai intended to convene generals from all southwestern fronts to jointly discuss major plans. While preparing, Bai went to Chongqing on official business. Upon his return to Guilin, he formally convened the meeting on the 5th of this month, lasting for five consecutive days until the evening of the 10th. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:

Attendees

This meeting was the highest military conference in the Southwest for resisting Japan, and also the first gathering after the establishment of the Southwestern Executive Headquarters. Therefore, all arrangements were orderly and the atmosphere was solemn. The location, time, and list of participants were kept secret before the meeting. The participants included commanders of various war zones in the Southwest, deputy commanders of various group armies, commanders of various field armies, commanders of various armies and divisions, chiefs of staff of various general headquarters, and senior political work directors, totaling over a hundred people. The Central Supreme Military Headquarters also sent Minister Xu Yongchang as a representative to attend and provide guidance. The newly appointed Deputy Commander of a certain group army, General Cai Tingkai, also rushed from Chongqing to Guilin to attend the meeting. Some who held positions at the front line were unable to attend due to their duties and transportation constraints, and designated representatives to attend. The solemn atmosphere and the enthusiasm were unprecedented for gatherings in Guilin. The participants were all senior officers bearing the great responsibility of defending the country and reviving the nation.

Meeting Circumstances

Many decisions made during the meeting concerned military secrets, which cannot be disclosed to the outside world, nor can they be leaked. What can be said is that from a proactive perspective, the meeting discussed what military strategies could enhance strength and strive for ultimate victory, and what political strategies could consolidate the revolutionary political front. From a passive perspective, it discussed how to coordinate political and cultural forces, implement the National Covenant, promote national spiritual mobilization, and elevate the revolutionary spirit of the entire nation. The order of the meeting was as follows: first, generals and representatives reported on their operational experiences over the past twenty months, as well as problems related to replenishment, training, and supplies. Then, in sequence, matters related to military, political, and economic sectors were discussed. Generals and representatives expressed their opinions and thoroughly examined the issues.

Policy Decisions

Regarding military matters, a unanimous decision was made on the strategy of protracted war, striving for an active position. Whether fighting at the front or in the rear, an active position should be maintained. Regarding political matters, it was decided to coordinate political and military efforts, and strengthen political institutions at all levels. Regarding economic matters, it was decided to implement a scorched earth policy and blockade the enemy's economy. Regarding cultural matters, it was decided to increase efforts and expand propaganda. Regarding personnel and financial matters, whether in military or political affairs, personnel must be reorganized, seeking only to select the virtuous and capable, loyal to the country and the nation. Reforming and adjusting military management is also an urgent task, eliminating all accumulated malpractices. In addition, there was close discussion of various strategies for commanding troops, training troops, and employing troops in the war of resistance. In summary, the results of the Southwestern Military Conference were: first, it achieved an unprecedented and powerful unity of spirit; second, it greatly invigorated and appropriately coordinated military and political efforts in the Southwest, in order to reap the fruits of victory in the second phase of the war of resistance. Therefore, this meeting not only added a special luster to the mountains and rivers of Guilin, but also brought unlimited optimism to the future of the war.

### China and the Soviet Union Open Air Route, Chongqing-Hami Segment to Be Tested Immediately

Guiyang Special Dispatch: In order to facilitate transportation between China and the Soviet Union, plans were made in September of last year to open a direct air route from Hankou to Almaty. After several months of preparation, it has been decided that the air route will start from Chongqing and be divided into two segments. One segment is from Chongqing to Hami, called the Chongqing-Hami (渝哈) line. The segment from Hami to Almaty has not yet been named. The Chongqing-Hami segment is scheduled for its first test flight on the 20th of this month, with stops in Xi'an, Lanzhou, Wuwei, and Jiuquan. It is expected that in the future, there will be at least one round trip each week, carrying passengers and mail.

### With Tensions Rising in Europe, Hong Kong Strengthens Defenses, Authorities Declare Military Equipment Robust

Hong Kong Correspondence: In the current situation where the Sino-Japanese War in the Far East is intensifying, Hong Kong, which has long been ruled by the British Empire, feels deeply uneasy. Unexpectedly, the situation in Europe, worsened by Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia, is even more precarious. Therefore, Hong Kong, small as a bullet, feels that today's paradise of peace may become tomorrow's land of terror. Thus, the current fate of Hong Kong and the British authorities' efforts to strengthen its military are worthy of attention. The various measures taken in the past two days are even more worthy of our consideration. Here is a detailed account:

Singapore Maneuvers Involving Hong Kong Troops

Since the Japanese army's invasion of Hainan Island, communication between Hong Kong and Singapore has been cut off, which has a considerable impact on British military affairs in the Far East. Therefore, in addition to actively strengthening Singapore's defenses, large-scale land, sea, and air force exercises have recently been held, indirectly demonstrating power against Japan. The exercise dates are scheduled to begin on the 17th. In addition to the full mobilization of all local garrison troops, British ships stationed in Hong Kong will also sail to participate. This indicates that Hong Kong and Singapore's defenses are inseparable. Three days ago, British ships stationed in Hong Kong waters, including the HMS "Effingham" and HMS "Dorsetshire" (cruisers), HMS "Encounter", HMS "Danae", HMS "Dauntless", HMS "Diamond", HMS "Suffolk" (destroyers), as well as the aircraft carrier HMS "Eagle", transport ship HMS "Medway", and several submarines, sailed towards Singapore under the command of the flagship HMS "Kent". Among them, the "Dorsetshire," "Encounter," "Danae," and "Diamond" patrolled the Strait of Malacca and are scheduled to arrive in Singapore on the 17th. After the exercises are completed, they will return to Hong Kong.

Coastal Defenses Exceptionally Solid

After the news of the tense situation in Czechoslovakia reached Hong Kong, the hearts of people in Hong Kong were shaken. Fearing that this would affect the market, the military authorities openly announced the general situation of Hong Kong's coastal defenses, stating: Since 1936, the port fortresses of Hong Kong have been under reconstruction. After several years, all work has been completed. The forts themselves are incredibly strong, and no air raid bombing can destroy them. The close connection between the forts and the necessary preparations for various defenses are also exceptionally thorough and safe. The artillery of each fortress is the latest type of weapon in Britain, with a long range and strong destructive power, making it impossible for foreign warships to approach Hong Kong waters. As for the army, the defense arrangements in coastal areas have long been completed. British and Indian troops stationed in Hong Kong are constantly on high alert, and the strength of the air force and improvements in air defense preparations are sufficient to resist any foreign invasion. Even if an emergency suddenly occurs, Hong Kong will be safe and sound.

Naval Authorities Deepen Seabed

At the end of last week, the Hong Kong naval authorities, suddenly ordered the water authorities to order the fishing boats moored in Aberdeen (where Hong Kong's fishing fleets gather, and where British ships and warships first approached Hong Kong, actually the front gateway for Hong Kong's communication with the outside world) to leave and move to the waters off Wong Chuk Hang. After receiving the order, the fishing households moored their fishing boats at the designated location. However, because the fishing households and residents on shore did not know what the Hong Kong government's intention was, everyone was panic-stricken. At the same time, sources said that the foundation work for the defense works along the coast of Aberdeen, such as machine gun positions, searchlights, and anti-aircraft guns, had been under construction for two months and would soon be completed. At that time, the Hong Kong authorities plan to designate the Aberdeen area as a military zone and deploy large ships to moor there. However, the Hong Kong authorities specifically issued an interpretation of this matter the other day, saying that because the waters of Aberdeen Harbor are gradually being silted up, they plan to send specialists to measure the depth and deepen the seabed to avoid obstructing fishing boats. Therefore, they had to order the fishing boats to move elsewhere.

Recruiting Air Force Reserves

After London decided to recruit local people in various colonies to participate in land, sea, and air defense, and decided to organize five hundred air force teams to cope with future events, the Hong Kong government also publicly announced on the 12th that it would recruit air force reserve personnel. After strict training, they will be formed into a strong air force directly under the Hong Kong government, so that they can be called upon to assist in air defense and cope with war when necessary. After the news came out, many Chinese and Westerners applied for it. However, the Hong Kong government did not announce how many were accepted. It is reported that after the establishment of this air force reserve team, it will use the Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon and the Far East Aviation School as training locations. Under the guidance of active air force officers, they will be taught various skills in driving and combat. After graduation, with the approval of the British authorities, they can become official air force reserves. When necessary, they will be called up by the government and sent to fight. Therefore, it is expected that after one year, Hong Kong's air force strength will have greater progress.

### Guizhou Province Strictly Enforces Opium Prohibition and Sends Personnel to Seriously Report Violations

Guiyang Correspondence: The matter of Guizhou Province prohibiting the planting of opium is being implemented in phases according to the planned schedule and was fully completed last year. Now that the time for opium seedlings to emerge from the soil has passed, and the time for fruiting and collecting resin is not far away, the provincial government is sincerely concerned that there may still be wild or illegally planted opium within the borders of various counties. In accordance with the provisions of the Opium Prohibition Implementation Regulations, a general reporting is being implemented in districts again, with March, April, and May of this year as the period for general reporting. In addition to the counties where prohibition was implemented in the first, second, and third phases, which are still responsible for reporting by the administrative supervisors' offices in their respective jurisdictions, the provincial government has dispatched Zhou Nongzhang and others to Qianxi, Ziyun, Zhijin, Anan, Puan, Xingyi, Langdai, Anshun, Puding, Zhenning, Panxian, Anlong, Dading, Shuicheng, Pingba, Qingzhen, Guanling, Xingren, Zhenfeng, Ceheng, Bijie, and Weining, twenty-two counties where prohibition was implemented in the fourth phase, to seriously report violations according to the prescribed period, in order to emphasize the opium prohibition policy.

### Japanese Planes Fly Over Qingpu, Bombing Xixiang

Qingpu Correspondence: Xixiang Zhangliantang Town in Qingpu is crisscrossed with waterways and strategically important. The county government is located in the town, and the Tian Xiushan unit of the Loyal National Salvation Army is also stationed nearby. Japanese and puppet troops have repeatedly invaded by speedboat, but have been bravely repelled by the Chinese army. At 1:00 PM on the 18th, three Japanese planes flew over the town and bombed it, dropping a total of six bombs, destroying only a few houses. At around 2:00 PM on the same day, two Japanese planes circled over Jinze Town and dropped three bombs, one of which hit the watchtower next to the Houda Temple in the town. The tower was five stories high, and the top story was destroyed. The other two bombs fell in open spaces.

### He Tianjian Teaches Painting, Limited to Ten Students

The famous painter He Tianjian is renowned in the art world for his excellence in poetry, calligraphy, and painting. His calligraphy is based on the Wei and Jin dynasties, and his paintings follow the Song and Yuan dynasties. His landscapes are based on the Five Dynasties and the Two Song dynasties. He taught at the North and South Art Schools, producing many students. His teaching approach has always emphasized rigor. Beginners focus on basic exercises, with a thorough grounding in the source of every tree and stone. For example, trees adopt the crab claw and deer antler methods, while stones use the hemp fiber and folded ribbon wrinkles. Progressing from shallow to deep, principles and interests are both considered. Before the war, he accepted an invitation from friends in Beiping and Tianjin to bring his masterpieces to exhibit, which shook the art world in the capital. Recently, seeing that painting has become increasingly desolate, he is now fulfilling his long-cherished wish to promote the quintessence of the nation and promote painting by enrolling students and teaching them, limited to ten students. The application period ends on April 10th. The fee for national painting is 15 yuan per month for one face-to-face lesson per week, and 22 yuan per month for two face-to-face lessons per week. The fee for calligraphy is 7 yuan per month. As for those who submit posts and receive apprenticeships, the payment is 200 yuan for one session, and 300 yuan for those who also study calligraphy.

### West League Football Concludes This Week: Lido Surveying Wins Junior Cup at Jiaozhou Park on Thursday Afternoon

The West League football schedule for this week is the final week. On Thursday (the 23rd) at 3:00 PM, the Junior Cup final will be between the Lido team and the Surveying team. If it rains at that time, the match will be postponed to Sunday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The originally scheduled match between Lido and Rowing on that day will not take place. Lido's strength is quite strong, so the Surveying team is unlikely to be a match for them, and the championship seems secure. In the reserve division, Donghua will play St. Francis. Donghua had a very high chance of winning the championship in this division, but unfortunately, they lost to the West Police team last week, so the outcome of this match is crucial. The schedule for this week is as follows:

Thursday (23rd): Lido vs. Surveying (Junior Final) at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park.

Saturday (25th): East Selkirk vs. West Police (First Division) at 3:00 PM at the Racecourse; St. Francis vs. Donghua (Reserves) at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park.

Sunday (26th): French Army vs. British Navy (Second Division) at 3:00 PM at the Racecourse; Lido vs. Rowing Club (Third Division) at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park; British-American vs. North West Children (Third Division) at 10:45 AM at Jiaozhou Park.

### European Situation Unstable; Japan Again Plots Concessions; Japanese Newspaper Even Claims Concession's Existence Illegal; Puppet "Reformed Government" Organizes Anti-British Alliance

Foreign News: In view of the seriousness of the European situation, Japan has now proposed the cancellation of the Shanghai International Settlement, and advocated that the International Settlement should be treated the same as other Japanese-occupied areas. According to reports, Japan made this request last autumn when the European situation was serious, but it was temporarily shelved after the signing of the Munich Agreement. Now the same request has been put forward again. Yesterday morning, Japanese newspapers claimed that the existence of the International Settlement was illegal.

The puppet "Reformed Government" has recently organized a so-called "Anti-British Alliance" in Nanjing. The organization of the alliance is to incite major and minor traitors and people in the occupied areas to launch an "anti-British movement." The puppet "Reformed Government"'s open anti-British movement is backed by unseen hands. Since the August 13th Shanghai battle, British officials and the public have shown great sympathy for China's resistance against Japan, and have recently lent large sums of money to the Chinese government, causing jealousy from the puppet regime. The puppet "government" has issued a notice ordering various puppet "organizations" in the occupied areas to send representatives to Nanjing to attend the "Anti-British Alliance" meeting as soon as possible. The puppet "government"'s notice also pointed out that Britain caused the May 30th Massacre in Shanghai, leased the Shanghai concession, shielded the Shanghai Foreign Court, controlled the Chinese Customs administration, and harmed compatriots by importing opium into China. There is also an "Appeal to the Elders, Fathers, Brothers and Sisters of Jiangsu," which instructs Jiangsu puppet "organizations" to distribute it to various groups.

### Japan Plots to Strengthen Central China Intelligence; Personnel Mutually Reassigned

Mr. Kaso, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to plan to enhance Japan's intelligence work in the Central China area. In addition, the Japanese Propaganda Department has also recently reassigned its Central China propaganda personnel. Lieutenant Colonel Miyawaki was ordered to come to Shanghai yesterday, while Lieutenant Colonel Nagai, the former chief of the Hankou branch, was transferred to Beiping. Lieutenant Colonel Kaneko, the leader of the China propaganda team, was transferred back to Tokyo for another position.

### "Central China Company" Controls Silkworm Eggs

The Qingming Festival is approaching, and the silkworm breeding season is just around the corner. The seed production farms in the occupied counties have all been seized by the Japanese puppets and are controlled by the Central China Company. The numbers are as follows: Suzhou Hushu Pass: Yiyou, Yunong, Zhongxing, Jingbin, four farms; Dongting East Mountain: Shiqiao, Zhouxing, Huayun, three farms; Qian Wanli Bridge: Yunong, Sanwuguan, Guangfu Town Yongyi, four farms; Wuxi Zhaimentown: Yongtai, Qianqiao, Tianyi, Xinantown Yongyan, Zhangjingqiao, Jinong, Xishan, Baokang, Guohua, Houyangfang Qian Dayou, Shungeng, Qiusheng, Zhangjing Town Dasheng, Meicun Guangming, Xishuiguan Huangshiqiao Tianfeng, Fengnian, Gaochedubridge Guangming No. 2 Farm, Xueyan Bridge Qiuxin, North Xizhang Youjiatai Hu's Junior High, Peishengguan, Yanqiaorenwu Hall, Cunqian Yinong, Yanjia Bridge Dayou, An Town Dayuan, Zhoujing Lane Xinhua, Wangzhuang Hexing, Dangtoutown Dayou, Wutangmen Yufeng, Fengzhuang Hedong, a total of twenty-seven farms; Yixing Heqiao Dayuantian, Fangqiao Sanle, Linong, two farms; Changzhou Hedong Town Pengxi, Caoqiao Zhenhua, two farms; Jiangyin Fenggezhuang Tianfeng, Mazhen Xinfu, two farms. The above five counties, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Yixing and Jiangyin, have a total of forty-four seed production farms, ordered to produce more than 830,000 sheets of spring silkworm seeds, forcing farmers to purchase them.

### Japanese Puppets Vigorously Implement Narcotic Policy in Pudong; Shanghai West Earth Firms and Gambling Dens Plan to Move There

The narcotic policy implemented by the Japanese puppets in the five districts of Yangsi, Tangqiao, Yangjing, Lihang, and Gaohang in Pudong has achieved preliminary results in the past year. Countless thieves, ruffians, and idlers who are directly affected by narcotics have been added. It is reported that they plan to expand the scope to increase revenue. Therefore, the future Pudong will become smoky and miasmic, equivalent to a second Shanghai West. The details are as follows:

Opium

All the opium sources in the opium dens along the coast of Pudong are either secretly transported by people, or purchased from the earth firms in Shanghai West. However, the distance is too far and it is inconvenient. Therefore, they will follow the example of Shanghai West and open an earth firm. If the conditions are negotiated, it will be implemented next month. At that time, the opium dens in Nanshi can also purchase earth from Pudong. Currently, it is estimated that about 20-30% of the people living in Pudong are addicted to opium, and most of them are puppet officials.

Drugs

After the price of opium soared, some addicts in Pudong who could not afford to buy it have switched to smoking heroin. There are drug dens open in each Lilong. It can be seen in the alley, sitting on the ground, addicted to drugs. They are everywhere, skinny. It is estimated that about 30-40% of the people are addicted to drugs. The puppet police are the most addicted, and it is more convenient to buy drugs than to buy earth, because there are several drug dens open in each town.

Gambling

After the closure of the Yongli Company gambling den on Dongchang Road last year, a group of gangsters opened a Huahui Datong in the back street of Dongchang Road, opening three rounds a day to lure people into gambling. Each Lilong is also equipped with a listening tube boat, operating in all directions. Generally ignorant men and women are flocking to it. The major gambling dens in Shanghai West are now reportedly forced to close down due to various reasons. In addition to planning to move to Hongkou, several gambling den owners are now operating in Pudong, planning to move the gambling dens from Shanghai West to Pudong. This matter is being secretly carried out. Therefore, Pudong will soon become a second Shanghai West.

### Zhenhai Remains Peaceful After Another Bombardment by Japanese Warships; Garrison Fiercely Retaliated; Damage to Haimen Was Very Light; Ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo Route Still Sailing

In an attempt to disrupt the rear order, in the past month, several Japanese warships have been shuttling back and forth along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, and from time to time firing and bombing the ports of Zhenhai, Haimen, Dinghai, and Xiangshan to obstruct foreign ships. Around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, six Japanese warships arrived again outside Zhenhai, moored in the waters of Ligang Qiliyu, and then fired on Zhenhai, totaling more than 400 rounds, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Japanese warships gradually withdrew until 2:00 PM. At that time, the garrison fiercely retaliated, but it is known that the local loss was minimal, only about ten houses were destroyed, because the people in the fortress area had been evacuated early, so there were no casualties. At the same time, four Japanese aircraft flew to Haimen to drop bombs, and the damage was also minor. As for the situation in Ningbo, it was exceptionally peaceful. Shops were operating as usual, and there was no panic at all. Ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo route were also sailing as usual. The German ship Hana and the Italian ship De Pinglun set sail for Ningbo at 5:00 PM yesterday. At 5:00 PM yesterday, it was also reported by the relevant authorities in this city that several Japanese warships had bombarded Zhenhai again yesterday. The details were not mentioned.

Strict Precautions in Various Coastal Areas

The Ningbo-Wenzhou-Taizhou defense commanders have all received orders from Commander-in-Chief Liu to take strict precautions along the coast of eastern Zhejiang to prevent Japanese troops from landing by surprise. Therefore, the precautions in the Yongjiang, Jiaojiang, and Oujiang are very strict. Ships are prohibited from sailing at night, and passengers and goods are inspected. Ships must be approved in advance. If necessary, all rivers will be completely blocked, and all blocking materials are ready. Solid defense projects have been built along the river, and heavy troops are stationed there. If the Japanese army invades, they will be severely attacked.

Japanese Warships Diverted, Shanghai-Ningbo Still Open

The Shanghai foreign shipping companies telegraphed Ningbo to inquire and learned that the Japanese warships outside the ports of Haimen, Jiaojiang, and Ningbo Yongjiang had diverted and the local area was peaceful as usual. Therefore, the Italian ship De Pinglun of the Sino-Italian Company and the German ship Hana of the German Far East Company sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo as usual yesterday. However, the Haimen route was approved for resumption by the Wenzhou-Taizhou defense commander, but the consuls of Portugal and Germany in Shanghai consulted the Japanese naval authorities, but the Japanese side still obstructed them, citing that the military affairs of Haimen, Zhejiang, were not over. Only the Maller ship sailed to Haimen on the 18th, but still sailed back to Ningbo, but did not take passengers.

### Candidates for British and American Directors of the Board of Works Have All Been Nominated

The Continental Daily News reported that the Shanghai British Association's pre-election of five candidates for the Board of Works was completed on Saturday and Sunday after a week. Members cast a total of 66 votes. Yesterday (19th), the association announced that it had nominated Keswick of Jardine Matheson, Mitchell of Taikoo, Bauer of Asiatic Petroleum, Hailey of Brunner Mond, and McDonald of Tientsin Wharf as candidates.

According to the Board of Works, the election is scheduled for April 12th and 13th. The Chinese directors of the Board of Works do not participate in these elections. Chinese residents of Shanghai will elect their own Chinese directors in late April, totaling five.

### Japanese Customs Officer's Irregular Conduct; Customs Commissioner Lo Has Reprimanded; Cautioned to Abide By The Rules Hereafter Otherwise the Customs Authorities Are Resolved to Take Action

Modern News Agency: A Japanese customs officer of the Jianghai Customs anti-smuggling team has recently abused his power by taking advantage of his authority to arbitrarily board foreign ships, illegally search them, and arrest Chinese people without authorization, who were then sent to the Japanese military headquarters. This matter has aroused resentment from all sides. British and American shippers are now discussing countermeasures. It is reported that Mr. Rutherford, the British Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, has investigated the matter and found it to be true. He believes that this action by the Japanese customs officer violates the customs administrative regulations and should be stopped. He summoned all the Japanese customs officers in the field on Saturday afternoon, reprimanded them, and cautioned them to strictly abide by the principles of service and perform their duties in the future. No more irregular actions are allowed, otherwise the customs authorities will not tolerate it and will take appropriate measures.

### "Transport Permit" Can Be Resolved Immediately; Rice Transported to Shanghai As Usual; Bean and Rice Market Strictly Implements Price Limit

The rice market, which has just stabilized, has risen again due to the problem of transport permits. The bean and rice market strictly maintains the price limit, the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee actively investigates rice reserves, and the purchase of foreign rice has just begun, ensuring that there will be no panic in people's food. The details are as follows:

Transport Permit Fee Can Be Resolved Immediately

After the Shanghai rice merchants, through the guild's persuasion, abide by the price limit and dredge the sources of supply, they purchase as much as possible in the market, and send people to the producing areas to purchase. Unexpectedly, the so-called transport permit in the producing areas, including various miscellaneous fees, originally required about 50 cents per stone. Recently, seeing the large-scale purchase of rice by rice merchants, they increased the transport permit fee to one yuan per stone. The rice merchants temporarily stopped transportation due to the increased burden and increased costs. According to rice industry insiders yesterday, the problem is being dredged and will not become a stalemate, and a solution is expected soon.

Goods From Producing Areas Will Not Be Cut Off

Due to the problem of transport permits, some rice merchants took the opportunity to make trouble and released various groundless rumors, causing the market, which had been stable for a short time, to rise again. However, rice boats from the interior to Shanghai have continued to arrive in recent days, only the quantity has decreased slightly. It is generally expected that after the transport permit problem is resolved, the large amount of food rice stored in the producing areas can be transported to Shanghai. According to the current situation, the source from the producing areas will not be cut off.

Market Strictly Implements Price Limit

In order to prevent manipulation, the Bean and Rice Market has stipulated methods to ban free trading, and strictly implement the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee's price limit of "14 yuan for high-quality white rice, and other qualities should be priced accordingly." Therefore, although the price of rice in the market has risen in recent days, it is still within the limit of 14 yuan. Although a few rice shops in the market inevitably sell inferior goods as high-quality goods, residents can report to the authorities for sanctions if they find that the selling price exceeds 14 yuan.

Actively Investigate City's Rice Reserves

In order to understand the exact amount of rice sold in this city and use it as a reference for evaluation, the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee immediately sent Mr. Jin to investigate rice reserves in the two concessions. According to a reporter from the New News Agency, the investigation is currently underway. The first step in the investigation, the work of all large and small rice warehouses in the two concessions, has been completed. The second step, the work of sending forms and asking each warehouse to fill in the number of rice reserves, has also begun. If there is a deliberate underreporting of the amount of rice reserves, it will be regarded as intentionally manipulating the people's food, and society will sanction it. Therefore, the exact amount of rice reserves in Shanghai will soon be fully understood.

### It is rumored that Xiao'an Will Travel East

It is rumored that the puppet "Mayor of Shanghai" Xiao'an is scheduled to travel to Japan at the end of this month to attend the "Urban Economic Conference" convened by the Japanese government. At the same time, the puppet "Mayor of Nanjing" Gao Guanwu, the puppet "Mayor of Hangzhou" Xie Ke, and the puppet "Mayor of Xuzhou" Zhang Yunsheng, who are under the wing of the puppet "Reformed Government," will also go separately to perform the ugly act of flattering their "masters."

### Fengxian Guerrilla Forces Annihilate Remnants of Japanese Army, Five to Six Hundred Guerrillas Encircle Retreating Japanese, Shenjia Garden and Xiaotang Ablaze

The guerrilla force led by Li Zhiming in Fengxian, Pudong, has been extremely active recently. The night before last (the 18th), they led five to six hundred guerrillas to encircle the remaining Japanese troops near Nanqiao in four directions. They fought fiercely with the Japanese all night. The Japanese troops, numbering only seventy or eighty, were outnumbered and suffered heavy losses. The Japanese troops then retreated to Shenjia Garden, while telegraphing to Minhang for reinforcements. After receiving the report, the army immediately dispatched a large force. While passing near Xiaotang, they encountered an ambush by guerrillas and a fierce battle ensued. The Japanese troops were unable to hold and fled southwest. As a result of the battle, both sides suffered considerable casualties. During the intense shelling, many houses in the town were burned down, especially in the area west and south of Hengjing, with the fire reaching Hongfu Building to the north, which also suffered significant damage.

Transportation Restored in the Huangpu River Area

Transportation on the south Huangpu River, which was once blocked, with all ferries to Pudong Xidongjiadu, Zhoujiadu, Nanmatou, Bailianjing, and Wangjiadu suspended, creating a serious situation as if a major battle was about to break out, has gradually resumed since yesterday (the 19th). However, Japanese and puppet police detectives are densely deployed and conduct strict inspections.

Inland Waterway Transportation Disrupted

Recently, the Chinese guerrilla forces hiding in various towns and villages in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been extremely active, and inland waterway transportation has been severely affected, with frequent disruptions. It is reported that the small steamships of the Shanghai Inland Water Steamship Company, which operate routes to Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, have suspended services to Pinghu and Haiyan due to intense fighting, in addition to the Hangzhou and Changzhou routes, which have been suspended for a long time. The Xinwuku liner has also temporarily suspended operations due to unrest along the route. The Jiaxing and Huzhou liners only load cargo and do not carry passengers. The Xie Li and Heng Feng steamship companies have also stopped selling passenger tickets to Suzhou, Wuxi, Jiangyin, and other ports along the route, indicating that the situation in various inland river areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang is unstable.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Cables Instructions: For-Profit Corporations to Maintain Status Quo, The 28th Year Has Begun, Shanghai's Environment Remains Unique

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday to various trade associations and member stores, stating that the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent a cable stating that the "Provisional Measures for Maintaining the Status Quo of For-Profit Corporations During Extraordinary Periods," promulgated by the National Government on April 23, 1938, had previously been forwarded to the Chamber for compliance. Now that the 28th year has begun and the environment in Shanghai remains unique, the convening of shareholder meetings and the re-election of directors and supervisors of for-profit corporations in the area may still be handled in accordance with the aforementioned measures. The Chamber is requested to inform everyone accordingly. The original text of the provisional measures is as follows: Article 1: These measures shall apply to for-profit corporations in war zones or areas close to war zones when the exercise of their statutory powers is hindered.

Article 6: If the for-profit corporation has no director representing the company, the actions in the preceding two articles shall be performed by other directors or supervisors. Article 7: These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.

### Transferred Postal Workers About to Depart, Establishment of Head Office in Shanghai Solely for Convenience

After the Shanghai Postal Administration was ordered to transfer sixty-five postal workers of grades A and B, there were rumors that the postal administration was being undermined, or that the postal administration had accepted the demands of the transferred postal workers, and the rumors were varied and inconclusive. According to Mr. Wang Weisheng, the Deputy Director of Postal Affairs of the Bureau, the various external rumors are completely unfounded. The postal workers transferred by the Bureau were ordered to do so, and the sixty-five postal workers are currently on vacation and handling the handover, and are expected to depart in batches at the beginning of next month. As for the establishment of the Shanghai Office of the Postal Administration this time, it is because the Head Office cannot reach everything, and there is no other effect. In the future, all internal administration will be handled by the Office with full authority, and reports will be submitted to the General Post Office on schedule for record. According to the internal postal worker hierarchy of the Post Office, it is divided into (1) Director of Postal Affairs, (2) Deputy Director of Postal Affairs, (3) Postal Officer, (4) Postal Assistant, (5) Postman. The salary is paid as follows: Director of Postal Affairs, 800 yuan per month; Deputy Director of Postal Affairs, 600 to 700 yuan; Postal Officer, Grade A approximately 270 yuan to 500 yuan, Grade B 40 yuan to 270 yuan. It is also rumored that Grade B postal workers are not eligible for transfer, but this regulation was reportedly abolished in 1927. As for foreign postal workers serving in various post offices in China, there are only about seventy or eighty, and their salaries were previously calculated in taels of silver, but now they are paid in yuan.

### Adjustment of Foreign Trade Successful, Imports Decreased, Exports Increased, Increase Production of Domestic Goods, Concentrate on Ports for Export, Purchase Domestic Goods to Replenish Foreign Exchange Fund

After trade personnel have worked hard to adjust foreign trade, increase exports, and restrict imports, imports have sharply decreased, and exports of domestic goods have increased. Now, efforts will be made to increase the production of major domestic goods, concentrate on ports for export, and purchase domestic goods nationwide to replenish the foreign exchange fund. The details are as follows:

Imports Decreased, Exports Increased

Compared with 1936, the import and export trade in 1938 saw a decrease of 55,345,169 yuan in imports and an increase of 19,051,769 yuan in exports. The largest decrease in imports was in metals and mineral ores, totaling 42.93 million yuan, followed by cotton, cotton yarn, cotton money, vehicles and boats, miscellaneous metal products, groceries, wool and its products, candles, soaps, oils, fats, waxes, gums, rosin, medical books, maps, paper, wood and paper products, dyes, pigments, paints, and varnishes, all of which decreased by more than 10 million yuan. The largest increase in exports was in textile fibers, totaling 52.14 million yuan, followed by mineral ores, metals, and metal products, totaling 49.83 million yuan, and then groceries, animals, and animal products, all of which increased by more than 10 million yuan.

Increase Production, Purchase, and Export

The Trade Commission has decided to increase the production of ten major domestic goods, such as silk, tea, tung oil, bristles, leather, and wool, concentrate on exports through Hong Kong, and assess prices in various production areas. The Central Trust Bureau, China Tea Company, China Vegetable Oil Company, Fuhua Company, and local merchants in the industry are entrusted to purchase domestic goods nationwide to replenish the foreign exchange fund. In order to adjust wartime transportation, the Commission has provided its own freight cars to operate between provinces, specifically to load domestic goods for export. All domestic goods that have legally sold foreign exchange will be exempt from export taxes. The Central Trust Bureau will underwrite the insurance for military risks along the way, using an accounting method. If the goods are sold at a loss, the insurance premium will be waived in order to reduce the cost of domestic goods and promote the export of domestic goods.

### "Liverpool" Ship Expected to be Released, Japanese Consul Claims the Case is Now Clear

The Greek ship "Liverpool," which is represented by the Norwegian company Wah Lun & Co. at the intersection of Wuma Road and Sichuan Road in the city, loaded cargo in Tianjin on the 2nd of this month and sailed to Shanghai. After entering the Wusongkou, it was about to dock at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong when it was suddenly detained by the Japanese Navy, forced to anchor in the center of the Yangshupu Bridge, and was not allowed to unload its cargo. After the Greek Consul-General in Shanghai made representations to the Japanese side, the cargo began to be unloaded on the evening of the 4th. However, the Japanese side still used the excuse that the ship's nationality was unclear and refused to release the ship. It has been detained for almost a month now. According to a report from the Modern News Agency, regarding the detention of the "Liverpool," the Greek Consulate has recently made strong representations again, and clearly stated that the ship is indeed owned by Greek merchants, and all supporting documents are on file in the Consulate. The Japanese side's excuse for detention is completely unjustified. Therefore, the Japanese Consulate has stated that the case is now clear, and it is expected that the ship will be released in the near future.

### Counterfeit Currency in North China Cannot Enter Guerrilla Areas, Actively Plotting Results in Light Abandonment, Even Puppets Know Hearts are Weary and Efforts Futile?

According to the French-language "Peiping Political News," the "Provisional Government" here previously issued an "order" prohibiting the use of legal tender in North China from March 11th, but this "order" has obviously been ineffective and has been withdrawn in a disguised manner. What is this method? That is, it is stipulated that legal tender can still be used in the "bandit areas," and the so-called "bandit areas" are the guerrilla areas where Chinese military forces are located. The existence of guerrilla areas has long been established, and this time it is only formally recognized by the Japanese and puppet sides. However, apart from the so-called "bandit areas," the territory under the jurisdiction of the Japanese and puppet troops is also pitifully small, because all farmers outside the suburbs refuse to use counterfeit currency, and guerrilla teams treat anyone who possesses counterfeit currency as a traitor. As a result, the area where counterfeit currency can circulate is becoming narrower. In the beginning, the "Provisional Government" put a lot of effort into promoting counterfeit currency, but now it has abandoned its promotion plan in the name of "bandit areas." However, the Japanese and puppet sides here are still sparing no effort to undermine legal tender. It is claimed that "within six months," legal tender can be made to collapse. But in reality, the promotion of counterfeit currency by the "Joint Reserve Bank" has been going on for many months, and the influence of legal tender in North China is still the same. On the contrary, the promotion of counterfeit currency has been unable to penetrate the guerrilla areas. This has also been admitted by the North China puppet "regime" itself.

### Australian Trade Commissioner Returns to Shanghai

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," Mr. Bowden, the Australian Government Trade Commissioner in Shanghai, who went to Manila and Hong Kong on official business, returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 19th) on the Japanese Empress.

### Due to Rising Food and Fuel Prices, Relief Standards for Refugees Increased, Total Relief Expenses Increase by About 10,000 Yuan Per Month, Rickshaw Pullers Warmly and Politely Decline

The Board of Directors of the Refugee Relief Association held its eleventh meeting the day before yesterday and resolved the following important matters: (1) Revisions to the Relief Standards for the Second Half of March: As rice and coal prices have risen, with rice reaching 13 yuan per stone and coal reaching 33 yuan per ton, the relief standards for March have been revised. It is estimated that 7 yuan, 7 jiao, 7 fen and a half should be given to every 100 people per day. This month is 31 days, and the full month's relief per person is 2 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen. In addition to the 1 yuan issued in the first half of the month, 1 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen should be issued for the 16 days in the second half of the month. Compared with the previous standards, the revised standards increase by 2 jiao and 5 fen per person per month, and the total relief expenditure will increase by approximately 10,000 yuan. (2) Appointed Ma Qichang and Bao Wenxin as members of the Affairs Committee. (3) Resolved to establish a work training group in the Relief Office to oversee refugee skills training and production, with Chen Heqin as the director and Chen Xianmo as the deputy director. (4) Appointed Ying Chengyi as a member of the Relief Committee. (5) Appointed Ren Shigang, Wang Xingyao, Gao Shiheng, Li Xizhao, Shi Duhui, Pan Yangyao, Gu Bingyuan, Yang Chonggao, Tong Runfu, Cheng Shouchong, Zhang Wenkui, and Yu Tinghui as consultants to the Employment Service Group of the Relief Office. (6) Approved the rules of procedure for the Employment Service Group of the Relief Office. (7) Decided to express appreciation for the excellent results and clear procedures of the Education Production Fund raised by the Education Group Fundraising Committee.

Municipal Joint Broadcast Ends Tonight

The municipal Joint Relief Association for Women and Children's Education Institute's broadcast for fundraising and publicity was held for the third day yesterday, with speeches by Committee Members Cao Zhigong, Wang Jian'e, Wu Ruisheng, and Le Gengbao. It will continue to be held at the Washington Radio Station today, with programs including Pinghua, Tanci, and comedy from Runyu Society and Guangyu Society, which are extremely exciting. The event is scheduled to end at 12:00 tomorrow night. The Institute has also scheduled its first board meeting for the 25th of this month to elect the chairman and director, and actively carry out the Institute's affairs.

Rickshaw Pullers Work Hard and Cannot Bear to Levy Donations

Four rickshaw pullers from the city, Cang Gongwen, He Wushan, Zhu Fengxiang, and Xu Zhulin, in the name of general representatives, suggested to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association that the city's public rickshaws, totaling 9,500, operate two shifts a day, morning and evening. If each shift donates 1 fen of national currency, each rickshaw can donate 6 jiao per month, and the total monthly donation can be 5,700 yuan, and the annual total can be 68,400 yuan. They requested that the Association liaise with Gu Songmao, Yin Zhiling, and Hou Shaoan, etc. of the Rickshaw Merchants Fundraising Committee, to collect the donations monthly with the rickshaw rental fees, along with the license fees, and deposit them in a designated bank. The Association would then allocate funds monthly. The Association has studied the proposal and deeply appreciates the enthusiasm of the representatives. However, the Association's main purpose is to provide relief to refugees. Considering that the city's rickshaw pullers work hard all day, and the income from their fares is only enough to勉供 provide for clothing and food, the Association cannot bear to levy donations on them to avoid harsh taxes and show consideration. The Association has expressed its deep gratitude to the representatives for their earnest intentions and has replied to Mr. Cang and others for their information.

Writers' Association Actively Involved in Charity Sale

The art charity sale launched by the Chinese Industry and Commerce Art Writers Association has made considerable progress as the person in charge of the association contacted various relevant agencies and organizations. In recent days, major art manufacturers, such as Dujinsheng Silk Weaving Factory's silk fabrics, Shengsheng Art Company's round fans, Xinxing Arts and Crafts Company's batik silk products, Gu Tingkang's collection of antiques, as well as recent pastel paintings, Western paintings and Chinese paintings by major masters, and works by teachers and students from Xinhua Art College and Suzhou Art College, totaling thousands of pieces, were neatly produced and exquisitely crafted. The participants were enthusiastic and active, which is rare in the art world throughout history. It is reported that Mr. Ding Juntao, Sun Xueni, Hang Zhiying, Lin Kanghou, Wang Chang, Du Jinsheng, Wang Shourin, Ye Jianshu, Gu Tingkang, Chi Ning, Zhu Yazhen, Yan Wenliang, Xu Qu, and Li Yongsen have contributed the most to this initiative. After the last solicitation of winter clothing for refugee children achieved effective results, they have devoted themselves to relief efforts and fulfilled their responsibilities in their respective positions.

### Chamber of Commerce Asks by Telegraph to Allow the Transport of Casings to Shanghai, Handle it Like Bamboo and Wood

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, because the ban on the transport of casings to Shanghai is affecting exports, telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating that the annual sales of casings to Europe and the United States amount to 10 million yuan. In addition to local production in Shanghai, pig and sheep intestines are transported to Shanghai from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and more than 5,000 workers rely on this for a living. Since last year, they have been included in the goods that should be settled for foreign exchange. Now that the transport is prohibited, they are滞留留 in Ningbo and Wenzhou, and they will rot and stink over time. This will not only consume foreign exchange settlement funds, but also cause workers to face unemployment. It is requested that they be handled in accordance with the six types of goods such as bamboo and wood. It is urgently requested that you send a telegram indicating your approval.

### The Public Works Department Stipulates the Method for Inspecting Rickshaws

The rickshaw association of the special district held a meeting of representatives of the five districts on the evening of the 19th. More than 40 people, including Hou Shaodian, Wang Kunyi, and Zheng Jianquan, attended. Chairman Yin Zhiling led the discussion, and the results were as follows: (1) The refugee relief fee will continue to be paid, with a total of 2 jiao and 5 fen collected per month, including association fees. (2) The Public Works Department's regulations for inspecting vehicles may be difficult to implement, and it is instructed to make its own regulations, and send letters to all vehicle owners to fill in the forms. The announcement is recorded as follows: For the announcement, the Public Works Department's vehicle inspection office has notified that from April, the method for inspecting vehicles will be stipulated, with 9,500 vehicles being inspected in two months, and 2,375 vehicles being inspected every half month, etc., which has been approved by the association. The association believes that if the Public Works Department's vehicle inspection office controls the monthly inspection of rickshaws, it may be difficult for each vehicle merchant. In order to facilitate each vehicle merchant, a form has been printed and is enclosed with this letter. After receiving this form, each vehicle merchant should properly divide all vehicles into periods and fill in the form (if there are affiliated vehicles, they should be arranged according to the affiliation). The form should be sent to the association before the 25th of this month, and the association will compile and distribute it to the Public Works Department for inspection on schedule. This matter is for the convenience of each vehicle merchant, so do not delay. This is extremely important. This is a special announcement.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Circular: Identify Japanese Goods Trademarks, Compile a Compilation of Japanese Goods Trademarks for Verification by Various Agencies and Organizations

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, in order to enable trade associations and organizations to identify Japanese goods, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed the Trademark Bureau to compile and print a "Compilation of Japanese Goods Trademarks," listing all registered Japanese trademarks, company names, commodities, registration approvals, or rejected company names, so that customs offices in various regions, provincial governments, and local competent authorities can follow them, and issued a Commercial Letter No. 22925 to instruct compliance. The original telegram and trademark names are recorded below.

Pay Attention to Trademarks when Banning Japanese Goods

### Government Allocates Five Million to Develop Sugar Cane, Hires Experts to Guide Planting and Orders Sugar Factories to Relocate Inland

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to develop the sugar industry, has hired American sugar industry experts to come to China to guide sugarcane planting and improve technology, and has allocated five million yuan for development. It has ordered sugar factories in Guangdong province to find ways to relocate inland. Details are as follows:

Order to Relocate Sugar Factories Inland

Sugar is an essential part of daily diet, its function equivalent to salt, etc. Foreign sugar is imported annually in large quantities. For example, last year's imports were valued at 19,795,000 yuan. Since the establishment of sugar factories in Guangdong province, the quality of domestic sugar has been excellent and it has sold well throughout the country. Foreign sugar imports have decreased from over 80 million yuan to 20 million yuan. The Guangdong province sugar factories include those in Shitou, Xinzhao, Jieyang, Shunde, Dongguan, Pingtan, and other six locations. However, after the war, they were bombed by Japanese planes and forced to completely shut down. Now the Ministry of Economic Affairs has ordered the provincial government to find ways to relocate the provincial sugar factories inland to safe areas to resume production.

Government Allocates Funds for Sugar Industry Development

The soil of the southwestern provinces is fertile and the climate is mild, suitable for planting sugarcane. In order to develop the sugarcane industry, the government has allocated five million yuan in national currency for development. In addition to establishing sugar factories inland, it also encourages sugar farmers to use traditional methods to produce sugar, aiming to double production within five years. Besides meeting domestic needs, there will be surplus for export. It has hired sugar industry experts from Hawaii, USA to come to China to guide farmers in planting sugarcane, improve technology, and increase production. Because Chinese farmers are diligent in planting and labor costs are low, satisfactory results will definitely be achieved in the future.

Foreign Sugar Takes the Opportunity to Import and Dump

The quality of sugar from Guangdong province sugar factories is excellent, no different from imported products. Shanghai has always been the only major sales area. After the war, due to Japanese bombing, production was forced to shut down, leading to almost no domestic sugar being shipped to Shanghai. Foreign sugar took the opportunity to dump in the Shanghai market. As of the end of December last year, Shanghai's sugar inventory included 61,800 bags of Dutch coarse granulated sugar, 40,617 bags of Dutch brown sugar, 52,370 bags of Taikoo refined sugar, and 115,560 bags of domestic miscellaneous sugar, totaling 270,847 bags, an increase of 42,013 bags compared to the end of the previous year.

### Executive Director of Famine Relief Association, Baker, Returns to Shanghai after Inspecting North China Affairs

Dr. Baker, the Executive Director of the China Foreign Famine Relief Association, went to North China on the 4th of this month to inspect the affairs of the Hebei and Shandong branches. After arriving in Beiping, he stayed briefly, discussing various agricultural benefit matters with the director of the association's Beiping office. Then, he immediately transferred from Tianjin to Jinan, inquiring and instructing about the Shandong branch's affairs. Now that the official business is completed, he returned to Shanghai from Qingdao by ship yesterday.

### Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Management Policies for Shelters (Continued from Yesterday)

There are a few more points to report to everyone:

(1) I hope everyone pays attention to today's notice, especially the eight creeds: (1) No favoritism, (2) No protectionism, (3) No self-interest, (4) No corruption, (5) No smoking, (6) No drinking, (7) No gambling, (8) No fighting.

The past is like yesterday's death. I hope that from now on, everyone will strictly abide by these creeds. Therefore, past mistakes, whether reprimanded or penalized, will be forgiven. However, if anyone violates the creeds again in the future, instead of being reprimanded or penalized, they will be dismissed directly without leniency. Because our colleagues' knowledge is higher than that of the refugees, how can we manage the refugees if we are not strict?

(2) Self-interest and corruption are not tolerated by the law. In order to prevent this precisely, the association has specially formulated measures for reporting and rewarding: (A) For those who report and are confirmed by the association's investigation, for corruption from one copper coin to one yuan in national currency, a reward of one yuan will be given. For those from one yuan to ten yuan, the reward will be the amount proven. For those above ten yuan, a discretionary commission will be awarded, and a merit will be recorded depending on the severity of the case. (B) If someone knows but does not report, and it is discovered and reported by a third party, the person covering up will be fined an amount equivalent to the reward given to the reporter according to clause A, to be given to the third-party reporter. (C) If there is concrete evidence of self-interest or corruption, legal action will be taken.

(3) After the meeting, please fill out and return the Type B personnel form. This form is specifically for evaluating service performance at the end of the shelter period, as a basis for introducing employment opportunities.

(4) In addition to direct inspections by personnel from the general management office of the association's shelters at any time, opinion boxes and informant boxes will be set up in each shelter so that refugees can report directly to the general management office at any time.

(5) The shelter stipulates that every Sunday is a holiday, but those in the same position must still take turns staying at the shelter. If someone needs to go out for personal matters or take sick leave, they must first obtain proof from the medical office. There are separate reward and salary deduction measures for holiday rest and frequent leave. (End)

### Broadway Mansions, Travelers Vacate Their Rooms, White Russian Staff To Be Dismissed

After the Japanese bought the Broadway Mansions north of the Garden Bridge, yesterday morning, the Japanese brought a specially made large Japanese flag to the mansion and stored it on the fifth floor. After the handover is completed, it will be hung. Upon hearing this, most Western travelers stopped renting rooms yesterday, paid their bills, and left. It is said that both parties agreed not to make any changes to the Chinese and Western staff inside, but a group of White Russian clerks will be dismissed and replaced by Japanese.

### Refugee Population Statistics

According to a report by the Public Works Department on the 19th of this month, 52 refugee shelters inspected by the department housed a total of 43,400 refugees.

### Haig Road Murder Case, Chen Tingsheng Assassinated

Stabbed More Than Ten Times and Shot Once

Mortally Wounded and a Suspect Apprehended

The famous Shanghai gangster Chen Tingsheng, also known as Chen Xiaosanzi, 36 years old, from Zhenjiang, usually resided on Haig Road. He had a wife and concubine. His wife, Wang Guizhen, 34 years old this year, is the younger sister of Wang Xinda, the false "Chairman of the Maintenance Society" in Fahua, West Shanghai. His concubine, surnamed Cao, named Aliù, is only 16 years old this year, recently married. However, both Wang and Cao were illicitly associated and had not undergone formal marriage ceremonies. The workers in a certain Huakang paperboard factory on Gordon Road in West Shanghai mostly worshiped Chen

as their boss.

After the outbreak of the war two years ago, Chen and his wife and concubine moved to the two-story building and small room of Hu Haigen's house at 39 Haigeliy Road, in order to be close to Wang Xinda's home in Fahua and have someone to take care of them. Wang Guizhen lived in the building, and Cao Aliù lived in the small room. Chen spent the night with his wife and concubine alternately. The night before last, Chen spent the night with Wang in the building's room. At seven o'clock yesterday morning, the maid hired by Hu Haigen's family at the back door

was emptying the chamber pot

when suddenly four thugs arrived, each with a pistol and sharp blade, threatening the maid not to make any noise. After the maid retreated into the house in fright, one of the four thugs stood guard at the back door, and three of them rushed upstairs, entering Chen's room. At that time, Chen was sleeping in bed with Wang. He was awakened by the sound of footsteps on the stairs and intended to get up to inquire, but the thugs had already reached the window and took out a pistol, first aiming it at Chen's chest

and firing a shot.

The bullet hit the left chest, not penetrating. Then, Chen was violently stabbed seven or eight times in the right temple and right neck with a sharp blade. Chen tried to block with both hands, causing each hand to be stabbed once. Blood flowed freely. Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the thugs swaggered downstairs and left. When Chen was shot and stabbed, his wife, Wang, was petrified and dared not make a sound. After the thugs left, she was able to calm down. At that time, Chen's injuries were already serious

and he was dying.

The family reported to the French police, who immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. An ambulance was called immediately and took Chen to Guangci Hospital, but it was too late. He died on the way. After arriving at the hospital, the doctor examined the body and sent it to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy, awaiting a court inspection today. The most serious and fatal injuries were the bullet wound in the chest and the three stab wounds in the right neck. The police sent personnel to take detailed photos of the injured parts of the deceased, in order to have them available for future investigation when the murderer is apprehended. It is also heard that the deceased's

concubine, Guizhen,

was extremely promiscuous. There are two rumored reasons for Chen's sudden murder: oxygen deficiency and political reasons. The police have taken the deceased's wife and concubine into custody for investigation, in order to apprehend the criminals and punish them according to law. Another account says that Chen had heard of actions unfavorable to him three or four days ago and intended to move his residence, but his brother-in-law, Wang Xinda, dissuaded him and guaranteed his safety.

One Criminal Apprehended

(Additional News) When French police detectives were inspecting Chen's residence, in addition to finding a bullet casing and a letter left by the thugs in the room, they also found the murder weapon in the garbage can at Haigeliy. At about 4:00 PM, Inspector Jiang Futian, Detective Shen Jinshui, and others apprehended a Tao, who is said to be a major suspect in the case, at the Yile Tianhuang venue on Xujiahui Road.

### Robbery at Cotton Mill, Chinese Constable Killed, More Than Thirty Gang Members Arrested

Seven Other Criminals Temporarily Detained by Japanese Headquarters

Head Constable Theft Case Also Solved

Four Stolen Pistols Handed Over to the Court

At 11:15 AM on the first of this month, the Anle Cotton Mill opened by Deng Zhonghe at 34A Bailinan Road in West Shanghai was suddenly invaded by several armed bandits who robbed 2,695 yuan in legal tender. When fleeing, they encountered Chinese Constable No. 2067 from the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The gang opened fire, killing the constable, and escaped with the loot. The Public Concession Police paid close attention to the case, considering the gang's audacity to kill a Chinese constable with gunfire.

Bold and Reckless

They ordered all police stations to strictly investigate. Until 9:30 PM on the 18th of this month, Jing'an Temple Police Station Chinese Detectives Wang Jinsheng, Qi Mengqing, Yao Changmin, and others learned that some of the bandits in this case were hiding in a shed on Jiaozhou Road. They joined Chinese Inspector Tang Jian, Wu Chengmo, Western Inspector Glenfey, and others to secretly go to the address and arrested four Jiangbei people, including Jiang Shouming. They also seized a Mauser rifle and seven bullets. Then, they went to 28 Robertsun Road and arrested four accomplices. Except for Jiang Shouming, who was brought back to the police station, the other seven were temporarily detained at

the Japanese Headquarters.

Later, they went to 284 Rongqingli, Xiaoshadu Road, and successively arrested thirty-five people, including Jiangbei people Zhang Fucai, Lü Wensheng, Xu Ganjun, Wang Linfang, Chen Bingquan, Wang Fusheng, Lu Zuo Fu, Zhu Asan, Liu Shoushan, Cao Zhenyu, Sun Renjie, Xu Kejin, Li Mingchen, Wei Burong, Zhang Decai, Lu Caipu, Wang Asan, Li Yuezhi, Sun Dongfu, Fan Lunzi, Zhou Dingzhi, Song Wencai, Shao Yide, Zhao Tongxia, Ningbo native Fu Yongshu, Chen Benlai, Jin Amao, Yangzhou native Li Zhenwu, Changzhou native Ji Zhigen, Zhejiang native Wu Ajin, Jiangbei people Zhou Detou, Xu Zhaolin, Xu Weibao, Wu Wengong, Mao Jinhong, and others.

constable who was robbed.

There were twenty-eight bullets. Finally, at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Xinzha Road, they captured Ningbo native Wang Xianghong (also known as Fu Ke). The above-mentioned six people, along with four pistols and stolen goods, were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan stated the circumstances of the case and requested permission to detain them. Judge Xiao briefly questioned Xu Yongquan and others and ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.

### Husband with Mental Disorder, Young Wife Dies by Poisoning

Wife's Family Launches an Inquisition

Demanding Compensation from Husband's Family

Qu Zhou Shi, a local woman living at 6 Zhenhua Li, Malang Road in the French Concession, her husband operates a large carpentry business, accumulated over 100,000 yuan, and has a son, 25 years old this year, a high school graduate, with a mental disorder. He was married once before, but the young couple had a bad relationship. After agreeing to divorce the year before last, in September last year, he remarried the daughter of Yang Ma Shi, a porcelain merchant from 3 Baxianfang, Baxianqiao, (19 years old this year). However, for more than four months since the marriage, there was no affection between the young couple, causing Yang Shi to feel that life was meaningless and there was no hope for future happiness. She returned to her mother's home on the 7th of this month. After being picked up by her husband at noon on the 19th, Yang Shi had a momentary lapse of judgment and took poison to commit suicide. At 3:30 PM, Qu Zhou Shi discovered this and sent her to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died at 5:00 PM. The hospital reported this to the French police, who took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren from the Second Special District Court arrived to verify the cause of death. The deceased's aunt, Qu Zhou Shi, claimed the body. Upon hearing the news, the wife's family launched an inquisition, negotiating with the husband's family, demanding that the funeral be conducted with high-quality burial clothes and a camphor coffin, that Buddhist scriptures be recited every seven days for her soul's salvation, and demanding 10,000 yuan in compensation. It is said that the husband's family has agreed to accept and will send the body to the funeral home for encoffining.

### Major Losses in Fire at Children's Middle School and No. 32 Shelter

All Houses Destroyed, Two Refugees Dead

Total of Fourteen Students and Refugees Injured

Doing Our Best to Handle Aftermath, Will Be Able to Recover in Short Time

The Children's Middle School and the No. 32 Shelter, both sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch on Aidoa Road, were unfortunately hit by a fire at around 1:00 AM yesterday morning. The school building and shelter, including a large shed made of reeds and three smaller sheds, as well as a hall in Xuyuan Park, were all destroyed. According to eyewitnesses, the fire started on the roof of the east end of the large shed, which was next to a wall fence with no houses nearby. Therefore, the cause of the fire is difficult to guess. After the incident, the association sent personnel to investigate. It is estimated that one (male) and one (female) refugees were burned to death. Two students suffered serious facial injuries, and six refugees and students each suffered minor injuries. The bodies of the deceased were taken by the police to the autopsy. The injured were given minor surgery by the health team and sent to the relief hospital for treatment. All the remaining refugees and students were accommodated on the original site. It is estimated that the various losses, including equipment, books, and construction costs, amounted to several thousand yuan. The association's vice-director, Shen Yanfang, has instructed the general affairs and shelter groups to do their best to handle the aftermath and restore the original state in the shortest possible time.

### Due to Guerrilla Warnings, Gambling Dens and Opium Dens Move to Hongkou

Six Establishments Have Already Relocated

Guerrillas Personally Ordered Closure

The North-China Daily News reports that gambling dens and opium dens in the Western District are now gradually moving to Hongkou and North Sichuan Road. Six establishments have already relocated there. This is because a large number of Chinese guerrillas have appeared in the Western District. Under orders from their superiors, they threatened to take action against gambling dens and opium dens. It was further learned yesterday that the guerrillas posted notices in the Western District on Sunday, denouncing the traitors and bandits who set up these establishments and advising them not to be used by the enemy any longer. Otherwise, they would be severely punished after being captured. The notice was signed by the leader, surnamed Guo. The fact that the notice was signed by the leader shows that there are several other guerrilla teams in Shanghai. The notice also stated that the team specialized in dealing with all gambling dens and opium dens, and would closely cooperate with other friendly forces to eliminate all local evils. In addition to posting notices, they also sent written warnings to various gambling dens such as Hollywood and Rong Sheng Company. These gambling dens are equipped with luxuriously decorated opium rooms. It is said that armed guerrillas went to the gambling dens, ordering them to close, coming and going freely without any worries.

### Ling Qihong, the False "President of the High Court" in Hankou, An Upstart

Chen Guocai Fills Position as False "Chief Prosecutor"

Ling Qihong, a Wu native who was formerly the president of the Beiping Lawyers Association, engaged in legal work after coming to Shanghai. When the War of Resistance broke out, Ling immediately fawned on a certain party, hoping to seize the Shanghai First Special District Court. However, thanks to the upholding of justice by various countries and the maintenance of the integrity of Chinese legal rights in the concession, Ling's high hopes were dashed. Later, through the recommendation of a certain party, Ling was appointed as the false "Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government." However, this position could not satisfy Ling's desires. After Hankou fell, Ling again lobbied everywhere, hoping to obtain the position of "President of the High Court" in Hankou. Now his wish has been fulfilled. He has been appointed by a certain party as the president of the "Hankou High Court" and concurrently the "President of the District Court." Ling went to Hankou on the first of this month to "take office." A few days ago, Ling secretly came to Shanghai from Hankou and hid in Room 318 of the Broadway Mansions in Hongkou, gathering his staff and assigning various false positions. The general puppets also held banquets to celebrate. As for the position of false High Court "Chief Prosecutor", Ling has recommended his confidant, Chen Guocai (former lawyer, who once served as the "Presiding Judge of the Civil Court of the False Shanghai District Court"), the false "Chief of the Second Section of the Social Affairs Bureau". Chen has completed the arrangements for his boat tickets and passes after being entrusted with the false position, and will soon go to Hankou to disgrace himself.

### Japanese Enter Qishan Middle School Twice

Visiting the Principal Without Meeting

Motives Still Difficult to Ascertain

336 Gordon Road in the Public Concession is the location of Huiling Middle School. Recently, since Qishan Middle School in Zhejiang Province moved to Shanghai to hold classes, and Huiling happened to have surplus school buildings, Qishan Middle School leased part of its school buildings for classrooms. On the morning of the 13th of this month, when the classrooms were in session, it was learned that a Japanese person in plain clothes, accompanied by a Chinese person in plain clothes, suddenly went to visit the principal. At that time, the principal was out and the teachers were busy teaching, so they did not speak to them and left. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 18th), Saturday, two Japanese military police officers and police officers from the police station jointly went to the school. It is learned that only the Japanese military police directly entered the school at the time, but because the principal had not returned to school, they just glanced at the classrooms before leaving. However, before leaving, it is said that they saw them copying down the door numbers and other things. Their intentions are unknown.

### A Review of Men's Health After Marriage

What does life seek? To be without illness is to be as a god!

To be physically weakened after marriage is the most tragic of sufferings!

Because there are many classmates, friends, and relatives and neighbors with whom we played together when we were young, and they all seemed to be in good health. But once they got married, before long, most of them were in a state of decline. Not only was their ambition depressed, no longer as proactive as in the past, but several people even died due to illness. The passing of old friends truly saddens me! Because I study medicine, it has further aroused my motivation to review the issue of men's health after marriage.

Does married life ultimately affect health? The answer to this question can be described as "everyone has their own opinion." But in summary, it boils down to two sides: positive and negative. Some say that marriage is detrimental to health. If a man does not marry and forever maintains his virginity, he can enjoy longevity. However, those who refute him say that in fact, one only sees that the lifespan of men who marry late is shorter than that of married men. Although unmarried monks may enjoy longevity, in reality, can an adult man remain unmarried? Therefore, there are those who generally say that marriage is beneficial to health, because the male and female sexes are innate instincts that are inherent and manifest their function in due course. If this function is overly suppressed, it will cause physiological obstacles. The most common phenomenon among men who marry late is hysteria and neurasthenia. According to the medical scientist James, "A man who has not married after the age of twenty-eight is somewhat neurotic." At first, we did not believe it, but after careful observation of the facts, we realized that his words were true. We have also learned from research in biology that some animals die because they cannot find a mate. Therefore, marriage is a necessary thing in our lives that cannot be avoided. As long as a man is pure in heart and abstemious before marriage, preserving his virginity, and can observe the principles of hygiene in married life after marriage, then the love between husband and wife can last forever, and they can spend their sweet life, bearing clever children, and organizing a happy family. In this way, not only can their health be improved, but their happiness in life will be enriched. It is truly what is called "many blessings, many years, and many sons." However, if a young man commits masturbation, nocturnal emission, or unrestrained licentiousness after marriage, he will inevitably develop spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, dissipation of energy, and neurasthenia. In this way, not only will he suffer from many illnesses and shorten his lifespan, but also he will not be able to coordinate in married life, often causing his wife to hate him, and staging all kinds of tragedies in the family! When it comes to this point, the problem becomes more serious and complicated. The only remedy, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, is to take the gonadotropin preparation "Sheng Zhi Su," which is the most appropriate and effective treatment. This agent is made by scientifically replicating the gonadotropin extracted from the bodies of strong animals, so it is pure in quality and effective, and its tonic power is positive, which is unmatched by other glandular preparations. After taking it, it can produce sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves in one day and night. If it can be taken continuously and persistently, then it will be possible to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time. Only those with spermatorrhea must also take "Himi Tuo Shi's Zhou Jing Pian" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that the effect will be even faster!

Health and Beauty

### The Value of Breasts in Women's Health and Beauty

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

It's not about boosting others' morale and diminishing our own prestige, but Western women are indeed more healthy and beautiful than Chinese women. Not only do they have firm chests and high breasts in their youth, and large hips, they have a majestic and high-spirited air about them when they walk. Even some older women, although their hair has turned white, their breasts are still so high, and have not withered. Therefore, the children they give birth to are also particularly intelligent and clever, and the physique of the people is also particularly strong.

According to the research results of world-renowned beauty expert and physiologist Kang Delin, and gynecological expert Tang Posheng, etc., they believe that the higher and more elastic a woman's breasts are, not only in terms of beauty, can they form the most mysterious curve with the hips and waist, making every man who sees it feel good, but also because of the soundness of their own ovarian function, the vigorous metabolism, their temperament is invariably open-minded and gentle, their muscles are invariably crystal clear and white, and their thoughts are invariably keen and meticulous. Even when faced with difficult problems, they can analyze them in a methodical manner, and will not feel overwhelmed. In addition, because of the smooth blood circulation, a peach-like smile appears on their faces, and even without makeup, they are extremely beautiful. Although age increases, youth remains, and the relationship between the sexes is infinitely sweet, organizing a happy and fulfilling family, and bearing strong and lively children. How great is the contribution of such women to the country and to the family! However, in the past, if the breasts were withered and the hips were thin due to chest binding, masturbation, irregular menstruation, leucorrhea and other symptoms, and health and beauty were lost, then not only would they be sick and in pain as virgins, with no beautiful and moving posture, but also once married, they would be disgusted by their husbands because of their lack of sex appeal and the above-mentioned defects, and even abandoned. The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" for women to nourish essence and blood, so that the ovarian function is sound and the metabolism is vigorous. Then not only can the above symptoms be completely cured, but also the breasts can be raised, the cheeks can be rosy, and health and beauty can be improved.

### Nocturnal Emission and Masturbation are the Demons of Youth

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Perhaps this is a deformed pathology of society! In this extraordinary period of thrift and national salvation, this isolated island is still filled with bright lights and debauchery, full of nets of eroticism and lasciviousness. Generally, young people who are just developing are in this tempting environment, not to mention that their hearts are also yearning for all the secrets between the sexes, preparing to explore what exactly is going on. However, on the one hand, because they are plagued by economic constraints and the terror of venereal diseases, they dare not openly engage in prostitution. But on the other hand, they cannot break free from the temptation of romance. Therefore, they have no choice but to seek the next best thing, and begin to commit masturbation.

After a young man commits masturbation, even if his thoughts are usually rich, his memory is strong, and his physique is strong, he will unconsciously degenerate during this period. If he suffers from nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and leakage of sperm due to masturbation, then at this time, not only will your developmental function stagnate, you will become underdeveloped, sallow and emaciated, and prematurely senile, which is what is called a "little old man"! This kind of "little old man" will accomplish nothing in learning and career because of the lack of brainpower and physical strength. Moreover, because of kidney deficiency and incompetence, and dissipation of energy, he will also destroy the happiness in his future married life! However, how can his wife continue to waste her youth in this way? Therefore, it is common for all kinds of tragedies to be staged in the family!

Regarding the treatment of nocturnal emission, although there are many advertisements on the market today, the most effective, according to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, is to take "Himi Tuo Shi's Gu Jing Pian." This agent can not only consolidate the sperm gate, but also calm the nerves, so that young people with neurasthenia can get sleep. Therefore, dreams are reduced, and there is no more mental turmoil, so that nocturnal emission can be cured. Only those whose nocturnal emission has already caused the above symptoms must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. If it can be taken continuously, it will definitely be possible to fully restore health in a short period of time.

### Lymphogranuloma Venereum in Gonorrhea

Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by gonorrhea is relatively rare, but general physicians with little experience often think that this is caused by mixing with other bacteria, or even think that it is another kind of lymphogranuloma venereum that has nothing to do with gonorrhea. This is a big mistake. It is necessary for astute physicians to make agile diagnoses and correct treatments. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by gonorrhea has fewer chances of suppuration than the general type, but if it is misdiagnosed, or even rashly treated like other lymphogranuloma venereum by cutting it open, it is easier to worsen. Of course, lymphogranuloma venereum caused by gonorrhea also has times when it suppurates, and of course there are also times when it needs to be cut open. But it is no longer the best policy for treating lymphogranuloma venereum caused by gonorrhea. The best treatment is to quickly cure lymphogranuloma venereum caused by gonorrhea when it has not yet suppurated. It is most suitable and can reduce the infinite pain of the patient.

Originally, lymphogranuloma venereum caused by gonorrhea is the result of a reaction in the struggle between gonococci and lymphocyte cells in the lymph glands, so in treatment, we must not ignore the rampant gonococci, and handle them well. The patient's inguinal lines on both sides are enlarged and painful, and there may be fever and chills. The treatment method is to use cold compresses to apply to the swollen lymph glands, or apply anti-inflammatory drugs, and intravenous injections to make them dissipate. If it has already suppurated, then perform surgery quickly. In surgical terms, the larger the opening, the better, so that all the pus can be discharged at once. Avoid using a needle to make a small hole, so that the pus drips endlessly, which may become dangerous as a fistula. The gonococci hiding in the prostate, anterior and posterior urethra, etc., still need to be removed completely with the German "Filtration, No Flow" electrical therapy and prostate massage, so that the lymphogranuloma venereum, which generally frightens patients, can be completely and fundamentally resolved. However, such patients are often mistreated by inexperienced and unknowledgeable physicians. For example, last month there was a Qian family patient who suffered from this disease and was mistreated by another doctor. He begged me for treatment and was cured.

Specialties: Also treats syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum, chancroid, and painless new method for circumcision.

### Fire on Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession, Exact Number of Children Killed Unclear, Fierce Fire Only Extinguished This Morning

A fire broke out on Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession, at the intersection of Rue Glandaz and Rue Paul Beau and Rue Baron Gros, at around 11:10 last night. The area was originally flat ground. Along Rue Paul Beau, bamboo fences were used as mud walls. Behind it was connected to De Sheng Lane, and to the right was connected to Ji Yi Lane. The interior was rented to the Sino-French Coal Factory and bamboo and lumber companies, etc., as material storage yards. The area connected to De Sheng Lane was covered with several flat houses for use as workshops. One of the rooms was rented to a certain bamboo ware workshop. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the workshop. Bamboo materials are easily flammable, so in a moment, it spread to the surrounding area. The flames soared into the sky, becoming uncontrollable. The French Concession Fire Department received the news and immediately dispatched fire trucks to put out the fire. However, the southeast wind was very strong, and all the water pipes were ineffective. The fire was gradually expanding, even burning the houses in De Sheng Lane. The fire darted here and there, making it impossible to get started. The residents inside and nearby who were affected by the disaster were awakened from their dreams. Because the fire was pressing, they could not salvage anything and had to flee for their lives. For a time, the cries of men and women and the cries of children were mixed together, and the order was chaotic. Most of them only managed to grab one or two quilts, and used them to keep warm while sleeping on the streets. The situation was extremely tragic. As of the time the reporter was writing, it was 12:30 this morning, and the fire seemed to have subsided slightly, but it still needed to be completely extinguished. It was also learned that two or three children had died in the fire because they could not escape. The girl who started the fire also did not escape. But because the fire had not yet been extinguished, there was no way to search, so the details still need to be reported later.

Demand exceeds supply, and there has been a temporary announcement of out of stock. Later, the pharmacy telegraphed the German factory to rush the goods to China. It is now reported that a large batch has arrived in Shanghai and is available on the market.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor, It was recently reported that Gu Sheng rented out his residence on Yuguan Road to open a gambling den. However, what was reported is not true. However, because the world is a dangerous game and people are cunning, I am afraid that someone will use this news to achieve their illegal attempts, and even more that villains will misunderstand the rumors, arousing covetousness. Therefore, I have no choice but to briefly explain the circumstances of this matter. Gu Sheng has no huge property, let alone ready cash. Since September 18, he has suffered repeated blows from the sluggish market. In order to reduce the standard of living and barely support the household, he entrusted a leasing agency to rent out his own residence, so that he could move to a smaller house to reduce expenses. This is entirely for personal economic reasons. After seeing the reports, he checked the contents of the lease with the leasing agency and learned that the conditions stated were all in accordance with the usual leasing practices in Shanghai and did not violate any laws. Moreover, the lease was drafted by the Tongren Law Firm, and the amount of rent was also determined according to the current rental prices of the same type of houses. There was no such thing as reported. Gu Sheng had already authorized others in advance, and there was no possibility of interference afterwards. Moreover, I believe that I have always been self-respecting, and my actions in life will be judged fairly. I have no room for praise or criticism. However, I am afraid that misinformation will breed misunderstandings. I dare to ask the newspaper to publish this letter in the Letter to the Editor section to correct the record and clarify the truth. I am extremely grateful. Sincerely, He Gusheng, March 20, 1939

To the Editor, According to Mr. Liu Zheran, the party concerned, he claimed to our office that he recently read in today's newspaper that the soil trafficker Jiang Yumen colluded with Liu Zheran, etc., to organize a general opium sales bureau in Western Shanghai, with Liu as the deputy manager, etc. He was shocked to read it. I am currently serving at the American Casey Foreign Company, and have no other business. Moreover, I do not know Jiang Yumen at all. The report is obviously a false rumor. The matter concerns my reputation. Please ask your lawyer to send a letter to the newspaper to quickly correct it in order to clarify the matter, etc. Accordingly, we hereby inform you of the situation and hope that you will investigate and correct it. Sincerely, Lawyer Chen Tingrui, March 20

Correction: Yesterday, this newspaper reported on the situation of the Fudan Alumni Association holding a celebration for Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday at the Xin Xin Restaurant. There were slight discrepancies in the facts. (1) Mr. Xia Jiancheng's speech was a congratulatory speech on behalf of the guests. (2) Mr. Zhang Chongren, Ma's grandson, represented him. This is to correct the record.

### Weather Report

Xujiahui Observatory, weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, the weather in North China and the Yellow Sea is clear to cloudy, cloudy in several places, with southerly winds. Central China and this area and the East China Sea will turn from cloudy to cloudy, with winds in no direction.

### The Recent Trends of Tuberculosis

— Ding Huikang

If we wish to prevent the occurrence of a disease, we must not only study its causes, but also pay attention to its growth and decline, its historical changes, and its relationship to human geography. In the industrialized areas of European countries, the mortality rate from tuberculosis has gradually decreased due to the gradual improvement of their sanitation facilities. In Germany, the number of deaths per 10,000 residents has decreased from 12% to 7.5%, which is due to the public insurance system and the progress of public health. In the recent century, Norway had the lowest tuberculosis mortality rate in 1910, followed by Denmark, and in 1920, the mortality rate in the Netherlands was even lower than that of Norway. After the war, the statistics of Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Germany all showed a decrease in mortality rates.

Recent observations indicate that Germany has a lower tuberculosis mortality rate than other countries, making it the country with the lowest tuberculosis mortality rate in Europe and the world. Canada's tuberculosis statistics are very high, with a mortality rate seven and a half times higher than that of other ethnic groups. In British Australia, the age of tuberculosis infection is very late. The situation of tuberculosis in India is relatively poor, with a very high mortality rate, with 30 deaths per 10,000 people each year. In Italy, the density of residents in cities, the lack of open squares and gardens, and the excessively small workplaces are all major causes of the spread of tuberculosis. In Nordic countries and the Netherlands, the annual number of deaths is less than the number of beds in national hospitals. In the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany, the number of deaths and hospital beds are almost the same. In France, there are two deaths per hospital bed. In Italy, there are five deaths per hospital bed. The number of deaths has decreased since 1925, and by 1930, tuberculosis statistics had decreased by 32%. The anti-tuberculosis work in Italy is carried out by the Fascist government, and the implementation of compulsory tuberculosis insurance has achieved excellent results. The tuberculosis mortality rate in France is also relatively high. Although the organization of the "anti-tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment network" is very complete, its results are not yet fully satisfactory. Generally speaking, France often maintains the highest tuberculosis mortality rate among European countries. The mortality rate in Belgium is relatively safe. In Switzerland, the tuberculosis mortality rate is not significantly reduced compared to the total number of deaths, and it is also higher than other European countries such as Austria, Hungary, Ireland, and Finland. The age of death is mostly in childhood. In Southern European countries such as Romania and Greece, tuberculosis mortality rates are high. The climate in Hungary is harsh, and the construction of houses is very difficult, so tuberculosis in that country can be called a residential disease. In Northern Europe, tuberculosis mortality rates are relatively safe, such as in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The tuberculosis mortality rate in Norway has also decreased. In 1929, there were 15.6 deaths per 10,000 residents, ranking eleventh compared to civilized countries. The tuberculosis mortality rate in Denmark is very safe, with 6.3% in cities and 7.5% nationwide, the lowest tuberculosis mortality rate in the world. Statistics throughout Russia are inconsistent. Currently, the tuberculosis mortality rate of the Russian ethnic group is higher than that of other ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, but it is lower in eastern Siberia. Tuberculosis statistics in North America show that the peak of mortality is closely related to population density. At the beginning of this century, the United States ranked first in tuberculosis mortality, but today it has fallen to sixth place. Michigan has a greater reduction compared to the southern states. In Cleveland, in 1930, there were only 8.3 deaths per 10,000 residents. This degree of mortality reduction cannot be achieved by people of color. In Mexico, the tuberculosis mortality rate has also decreased in recent years. The tuberculosis mortality rates in Argentina and Brazil in South America are very high due to poor public health. In the Philippines, the tuberculosis mortality rate in 1930 was 305.5 per 10,000 residents. Japan and China have similarities with the above situations, but it should be noted that the mortality rates within each region are not the same. Tuberculosis is less common in northern and western China, while tuberculosis is more common in central and southern China. In the past century, most black people have migrated to the Americas and become part of the "Scots-Irish" population. In the United States, statistics show that the mortality rate for white people is 7.2 per 10,000 residents, while the mortality rate for people of color is 23.3, which is three times higher than that of white people, a phenomenon that tuberculosis experts call racial hypersensitivity. In 45 major cities in the United States, the mortality rate has decreased significantly, averaging 8.13 per 10,000 people, with Chicago only having 6.6, but the rate for black people is 40. The reasons for this racial difference are difficult to solve, but the overall situation of the population is certainly related. The situation of tuberculosis in "rural areas" is as follows: a report from the Health Organization of the League of Nations proves that the highest tuberculosis mortality rate is in agricultural areas with underdeveloped industries, but most scholars still believe that the transmission of tuberculosis is generally less common in rural areas. What is most noteworthy is that people who move from rural areas to cities often experience severe illness within the first two years, especially young people. The relationship between tuberculosis mortality and "age" is as follows: according to German statistics, between the ages of 30 and 70, the rates for both sexes are almost equal. Between the ages of 5 and 30, the rate for women is higher than that for men. Furthermore, the mortality rate for school-age children has also been gradually decreasing. What needs to be noted is that new infections among girls are more common in schools than among boys. At the same time, it proves that the transmission of tuberculosis does not occur in the earliest years of childhood, but at a higher age. As for the reasons for the reduction of transmission, the most important are the improvement of school facilities and the immediate isolation after the discovery of cases. Recent studies on the infection of school-age children indicate that the infection is mostly due to family transmission, and the rate of infection from schools is very low. In large-scale examinations, 1% to 13% of university students are found to have tuberculosis, and there is also a tendency for active tuberculosis to increase. The relationship between occupation and tuberculosis is such that those who are most susceptible to infection are of course nurses and doctors. This special occupation is indeed more dangerous than others. In addition, those who inhale large amounts of dust, such as shoemakers and tailors, also have a higher infection rate. In northern Italy, it was found that 10% of residents over the age of 60 had tuberculosis, belonging to the open type. According to German statistics on open tuberculosis, the annual mortality statistics should be multiplied by at least three. For example, if the German mortality rate in 1932 was 7.5 per 100,000 people, multiplying it by three would be 22.5. Based on the country's population, this would be 146,250 people. The average lifespan of such open tuberculosis patients is three years, making them a major cause of family transmission. Furthermore, what is noteworthy about tuberculosis between "spouses" is that male patients are more likely to infect their healthy wives, because women often have pregnancy and childbirth-related factors, or because they exert themselves to care for their husbands, thus making them more susceptible to infection. However, tuberculosis between spouses is not as terrifying as one might imagine, because those who marry are mostly past the most dangerous period of susceptibility. According to recent world literature and statistics, countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany have achieved very satisfactory results in tuberculosis prevention, with a mortality rate of only 7 or 8 per 10,000 people. Although France and Switzerland have also made great efforts in tuberculosis prevention, they still have a higher mortality rate. In short, the transmission of tuberculosis in various countries is still very severe, and without sufficient economic resources, the success of its prevention will still be very difficult. What we urgently need to pay attention to in the future is the organizational methods of "unemployment insurance" and "health insurance", which are the greatest force in reducing tuberculosis mortality rates. The next step is the popularization of "X-ray diagnosis" and the improvement of "compression therapy", so that everyone understands that tuberculosis has no specific medicine in modern medical attacks, and long-term medication can instead increase the disease mechanism. The spread of tuberculosis in our country is a tragic result of superstitious medication and conditioning. Looking at the success of tuberculosis prevention in various countries, there is no other way.

Physiological Hygiene Talks

### General Physiological Knowledge and Physiological Hygiene Regarding Muscles and Bones

— Fan Shouyuan

Everyone knows that muscles and bones are the most important basic tissues in the human body's organizational system. General knowledge about these two human tissue systems, as well as hygienic knowledge on how to care for them, should also be noted by the general public. Now, I will separately write out a little general knowledge about these two organizational systems, which I think will also be needed by the general readers.

First, let's talk about bones.

The common name for bones is "bones." There are many bones in the human body, acting as the framework that supports the human body. The general name for these many bones in the human body is the "skeleton." If the human body did not have these bones, all the soft tissues attached to the bones, such as skin, muscles, etc., would have nowhere to be placed. In terms of function, it would not only be impossible to walk and move, but also impossible to stand upright. At the same time, many organs that rely on it for protection, such as the brain and spinal cord, would also completely lose their means of protection. Therefore, because the human body has bones, the organizational organs of the entire body have a place to entrust, and can be constructed into a human body.

The physiological function of bones was just mentioned in passing: (1) They are the position that supports the human body, allowing it to stand upright without falling; (2) They can make the human body move: actions such as walking and working cannot be done without bones as the main body; (3) They are the protectors of many important organizational organs in the human body: the most obvious examples are the skull bones protecting the brain, the vertebrae bones protecting the spinal cord, the eye socket bones protecting the eyeballs, and so on. As for their shape, they are quite inconsistent: there are strips, and the lengths of the sticks are not uniform, like pen tips and pen holders, such as the upper and lower limb bones; there are pieces, the sizes of which are not the same, like wood and stones, for example, the vertebrae bones belong to this type of shape: there are flat tiles, and there are many bones of this type of shape on the skull; and there are slender and curved shapes like bows, the ribs that surround the chest and back in the middle. In addition, of course, there are various other shapes, which need not be mentioned much here.

Changing the direction of the conversation, let's still turn back to talk about its hygiene.

The hygiene of bones seems to be not very noticeable on the surface, but in fact, it is also very important. For example, for the head and face, how should they be protected well so that they are not hit or touched with excessive force. Otherwise, if the skull is injured, it will lightly damage the brain and severely cause death. In the past, old-style private school teachers in our country punished students by hitting their heads with a hard ruler at every turn, which is a very inappropriate act from a hygienic point of view. Also, the pillows used when sleeping should not be made of overly hard materials: the sleeping time should also not be spent exclusively on one side, to prevent the skull from deforming and affecting the brain. (This should be paid special attention to in infancy and childhood!) As for young people in their reading years, the most important thing in terms of bone hygiene seems to be the spinal bones. If reading and writing are the daily work of young students, but if they do not pay attention to the uprightness of the sitting position when reading and writing, it is easy to affect the spinal bones, and gradually make them become curved. Young students often make the mistake of leaning and prostrating on the table when redeeming books and writing, and after a long time, it becomes a habit, and the shape of the spinal bones either becomes hunchbacked or curved. This not only impairs health, but also becomes an improper disease in terms of body posture. For this point, as long as young students pay attention to sitting upright when reading and writing, they can maintain the normal and healthy state of the spinal bones. Secondly, let's talk about the hygiene of the thorax. What is called the "thorax"? It is the part of the spinal bones in front of the human body's gatehead and behind the backhead, both of which are surrounded by a bow-shaped rib; a name for a range formed by these three. For the hygiene of this part of the skeleton, the clothes to be worn should be looser, and should not be worn too tightly, pressing on the thorax, otherwise, it will hinder the development of the chest. Chinese girls used to have the habit of binding their chests, and European and American women also had the bad habit of binding their waists in order to compete for wasp waists, all of which violated the act of violating chest hygiene; because this kind of act of bad habit not only affects the development of the chest, causing the ribs to deform, but also hinders the breathing of the lungs and the digestion of the stomach and intestines. Therefore, this kind of bad habit that violates hygiene should not be imitated by each other, but should be eliminated as soon as possible.

Finally, it is also necessary to say a word about the hygiene of the foot bones. Most young students now wear leather shoes, which does not hinder hygiene; however, the shape of leather shoes changes from time to time, and the toe of the shoe is sometimes pointed and sometimes round, which is where the agreement with hygiene and disagreement with hygiene lies. Because the shape of the toes is different for each person, and the shape of the shoes that is popular at the time is always sharp when it is sharp, and round when it is round. In fact, it is best to determine the shape of the shoes according to each person's foot shape, so that they fit the feet and are comfortable. But generally speaking, shoes with overly pointed front ends are prone to compressing the toes, and gradually forming a deformed state of arching and bending, which is definitely not the way to foot hygiene. Therefore, I hope that young people who love beauty should not only seek the beauty of the appearance when wearing leather shoes, but also ignore the comfort when wearing them and the convenience when walking; only by wearing shoes that fit the feet can they protect the health and beauty of the feet.

The hygiene of bones stops here. Let's talk about muscles next.

Muscle is the abbreviation of the two characters "muscle." Muscles are mostly attached to the outside of the bones. Almost every part of the body where there are bones has muscles growing around it. If we take a house as an analogy, then the bones are like the steel pipes of the house, and the muscles are like the cement attached to the outside of the steel pipes. According to calculations, the number of bones in the whole body is said to be 200; what about the number of muscles in the whole body? It's not as easy to count clearly as bones. Because the calculation methods of each person are different, some say 300, and some report 500; let's use a "lump sum" number here to say that it is roughly between 3500, which should not be a big mistake. Each muscle has a starting head and a tail ending; but there are also differences in the starting point being one and the ending being two or three, and the ending being one and the starting point being two or three. The reason why the statistics of muscles in the whole body are not unified is mainly because the starting and ending of each muscle are not uniform. As for its physiological function? That is extraordinarily complicated? It can be said that all the actions of the whole body cannot be separated from its control: to lift things, you need to use the muscles on your arms and palms, to walk, you need to use the muscles on your legs and feet, to eat, you need to use the chewing muscles to work, and even bowel movements and urination need the help of muscles. For the rest, a cry or a smile requires the use of crying and smiling muscles, and a breath requires the use of breathing muscles. In short, all the actions of the whole body will not be without its share.

What color are muscles? I believe there will definitely be many people who say in unison: "Bright red"! In fact, it is not. However, what you said about bright red cannot be said to be without a basis; when we peel off the skin attached to the body, don't we clearly see something bright red? What is this thing? No one will answer wrong: "This is muscle"! But wait a minute. This thing is indeed muscle, but the bright red color of this muscle is not the color of the muscle itself, but the blood stored within the muscle. If you soak this bright red muscle in a basin of cold water, it will soon lose its dye and fade, the cold water will turn red, and the muscle will turn pale green. This is like a piece of colored cloth or paper, when put into water, it fades and gradually changes to its original appearance.

Common Medical Knowledge

### Diabetes and Polyuria (Continued)

— Zhou Zhenyu

The Cause of Polyuria

Polyuria is a chronic disease characterized by symptoms of thirst and excessive urination. Although similar to diabetes, the thirst and urine volume are much greater than in diabetes, and there is no sugar present in the urine. Since its cause is unrelated to diet, although the urine volume is high, the amount of excreted substances in the urine, calculated daily, is not much different from that of a normal person. Only the water content is increased, and this increase in water is due to excessive drinking.

The root of this disease lies in a disorder of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is also an endocrine gland, divided into three parts: the anterior lobe, the intermediate lobe, and the posterior lobe. The substances secreted by the three parts have different functions. The anterior lobe is closely related to human growth and development. Excess secretion leads to tall stature, while insufficient secretion leads to short stature. The secretions of the intermediate and posterior lobes, although not directly related to growth, have the ability to contract smooth muscle. If their secretions are injected into an animal's body, blood pressure increases, urine output increases, and there is also the ability to contract the uterus, hence its use in obstetrics as a labor-inducing agent. While the metabolism of sugar in the human body is closely related to insulin, the secretions of the pituitary gland also have the ability to regulate it. Therefore, the pituitary gland is a gland with multiple functions. Polyuria caused by a disease of the pituitary gland itself is called congenital polyuria. The reason for this is not yet fully understood, but it is only known to be related to the internal secretions of the pituitary gland. Alternatively, it may be caused by tumors in the brain, syphilitic invasion affecting the nerves related to the pituitary gland, or traumatic injuries to the brain or spinal cord. Other factors, such as infectious diseases like meningitis and typhoid fever, where the toxin attacks the nervous system of the pituitary gland, can also lead to polyuria. Disease caused by these types of factors is called acquired polyuria.

The Pathology of Polyuria

In patients with polyuria, the pituitary gland or the nerves related to the gland are either injured or diseased, as demonstrated by anatomical experience. Experiments on lower animals have shown that damage to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland results in polyuria. Injury or disease of the nerves related to the pituitary gland also leads to the development of polyuria. Experiments on lower animals involving the injection of pituitary gland extract while simultaneously severing the renal nerves of the animal have also revealed polyuria. If the blood from this animal is transfused into the body of another healthy animal, transmissible polyuria results, the mechanism of which is currently difficult to understand. Recently, Mohr and Scheer experimented on dogs, tightly ligating the stalk of the pituitary gland with silver wire, resulting in polyuria. If the thyroid gland (another endocrine gland) was removed, the polyuria ceased, but if thyroid gland substance was ingested, the polyuria recurred. Thus, artificial polyuria can be created at will. In conclusion, while the pituitary gland is the primary factor in polyuria, the thyroid gland is also an important component.

The names of all the muscles are extraordinarily numerous, each with a different name based on its location or function. As for the structure of muscles, it is nothing more than two types: voluntary and involuntary muscles. What is the difference between voluntary and involuntary muscles? The difference can be understood simply by considering the literal meaning of the terms: voluntary muscles are those whose movement is subject to conscious control, while involuntary muscles are the opposite. This seems self-explanatory, and I believe everyone will understand it.

Now, let's talk about muscle hygiene. Because muscles and exercise are fundamentally and inextricably linked, muscle hygiene is almost exclusively concerned with exercise.

Why are muscle hygiene and exercise so closely linked that they cannot be separated for even a moment? Now, let's explain this relationship between exercise and muscle hygiene.

Generally, a person's health is judged by the development or lack thereof of their muscles. While this is not absolutely reasonable, it is not without considerable justification and basis, or it can be said to be relatively reasonable. We only need to observe that healthy people generally have relatively abundant and developed muscles. Conversely, people with weak muscles, the so-called "skin and bones" type, are generally not very healthy. However, whether muscles are abundant or not, firm or not, often depends on whether the person pays attention to exercise. People who pay attention to exercise tend to have developed and firm muscles; otherwise, their muscles are often lean, and their flesh is soft. Therefore, if a person wants to be strong and healthy, with abundant and developed muscles, then exercise is indispensable. This principle is very simple and easy to understand. However, now we need to go further and explain why exercise can develop muscles and make them firm. In other words, what is the principle by which exercise can develop and firm muscles?

Now I will explain this principle.

Readers all know, what phenomenon does our body experience during exercise? During exercise, the blood circulation in our body definitely becomes vigorous, the heart rate increases extraordinarily, and at the same time, body temperature also rises, breathing becomes rapid, and we sweat all over, eventually leading to muscle fatigue and physical exhaustion. What does this indicate? This indicates that changes have occurred in the substances within our body due to the labor of our muscles. What substances within the body undergo these changes? Physiologists have proven through experiments that the substance is the decomposition of "carbohydrates" in our body. Carbohydrates have a scientific name called "hydrated carbon," so it can also be said that the material change in the body during exercise is the decomposition of this "hydrated carbon." Since exercise requires the consumption of a lot of hydrated carbon in the body, it goes without saying that a large amount of hydrated carbon is needed for replenishment after exercise. The reason is clear. Laborers eat more, and people who have exercised generally increase their food intake in order to replenish the hydrated carbon consumed and lost in the body. This is just like when the fuel in a stove burns out, it is necessary to add coal and other fuels before it can be reignited and provide warmth. The accelerated breathing during exercise is also easy to understand. The material change in the body during exercise, as mentioned above, is the decomposition of hydrated carbon in the body, and the reason why hydrated carbon can be decomposed is entirely due to the oxygen in the air. In other words, the hydrated carbon in the body relies on the action of this oxygen to initiate the decomposition, produce heat, and generate the power for exercise. Accelerated breathing, on the one hand, removes waste products (carbon) from the body after they have been used, and on the other hand, supplies a large amount of oxygen from the outside to be used for decomposing the hydrated carbon in the body.

Because of this reason, the body heat and power consumed during exercise rely on the decomposition of hydrated carbon in the body, that is, during exercise, a large amount of hydrated carbon in the body must be consumed, and after exercise, it goes without saying that a large amount of hydrated carbon is needed for replenishment, and the food taken in for replenishment is often more than what was lost. When there is more replenishment than loss, the contraction ability of the muscles naturally increases, the muscle tissue itself also gradually increases and becomes firmer, and the muscle's power of movement also becomes richer and stronger.

This is the principle behind how exercise can develop and strengthen muscles, and it is also a simple explanation of why exercise is the only way to maintain muscle hygiene.

Because exercise can develop and strengthen muscles, it can also be said that exercise is the only way to maintain muscle hygiene. This has already been explained very clearly above. However, what has been said above only explains why "exercise" can develop and strengthen muscles, so the reason for the method of muscle hygiene. As for what kind of exercise can achieve muscle hygiene and achieve the goal of muscle enhancement, this has not yet been mentioned.

Exercise is indeed the only way to maintain muscle hygiene, but to achieve this goal of muscle hygiene, there must also be a limit on the type of exercise. Otherwise, if the person engaging in exercise exceeds the limit of "hygiene," they may not be able to achieve the goal of muscle hygiene. Sometimes, it may even create a harmful effect that is the opposite of muscle hygiene. The so-called limit is the appropriate degree of just the right amount. It should not be too tiring or too intense. When exercise reaches a considerable degree of fatigue, one must not ignore the overexertion of the muscles and continue exercising. Because when the muscles feel considerably fatigued during exercise, one should immediately stop exercising and give them a chance to rest so that they can recover. Otherwise, if one continues to exercise for a long time when feeling considerable fatigue, it will inevitably lead to a sudden decrease in ability and eventually reach a point where one is unable to exercise and has no strength to exercise. This is overexertion. When the muscles are overexerted, on the one hand, the waste products remaining after consumption in the body increase and accumulate, and there is not enough time to excrete them. On the other hand, too many substances are consumed in the body, and there is not enough time to replenish them. Therefore, the muscles are in a state of inaction where it is difficult to trigger a contraction even after stimulation. At this time, the only solution is to immediately stop exercising, provide rest, and provide fresh air, which can restore their fatigue. Therefore, massaging the legs and feet or washing the feet with warm water after running exercise or long-distance travel to promote blood flow in the lower legs is also a good way to restore fatigue.

Not only should the duration of exercise be limited, and not be too tiring or too intense, but also one should not be distracted and have various other thoughts during exercise. In other words, one should concentrate on exercising and not be distracted. It is also not advisable to use the brain for work immediately after exercise for a considerable amount of time. Instead, one should give oneself a complete rest with all thoughts emptied. Because during exercise, it goes without saying that a large amount of blood will flow into the muscles. If one uses the brain at the same time, then wouldn't part of the blood have to flow into the brain? However, the amount of blood in a person's body is limited. If the brain needs blood to think, the amount of blood in the muscles will decrease invisibly. This will result in damage to both sides, and neither will achieve good results. The reason why one should rest for a considerable amount of time after exercise and not use the brain is also because at this time, blood flow has not yet returned to a peaceful, normal state, and a large amount of blood is still retained in the muscles. If one immediately does other things and uses the brain at this time, such as reading and thinking, the brain will not get a large amount of blood, and thought will definitely not be unified. Reading will also be like not seeing, and one will not be able to read into one's brain.

Finally, let's talk about a few things to pay attention to regarding exercise as the conclusion of this section.

(1) Exercise should be done in a clean place, and outdoors is better than indoors, because it is easier to breathe fresh air.

(2) When exercising, it is advisable to wear short clothes and pants that are comfortable and easy to move in. Tight and narrow clothes that constrict the neck and chest can hinder blood flow and smooth breathing, and are not suitable at all.

(3) To engage in exercise, one must have perseverance, do it regularly every day without interruption. At the same time, it is especially important to progress gradually, from easy to difficult, from light to heavy. One must not suddenly be light and then heavy, suddenly start and then stop, without a standard.

(4) It is not advisable to exercise before or after eating. One should also temporarily stop when feeling physically or mentally unwell.

(5) Exercise should not be allowed to become too tiring and should be based on each person's original physical strength. One must not force oneself. After exercise, one must also have a considerable amount of rest time and should not immediately do other work - whether physical or mental work, both are not advisable.

(6) After exercising, drink more boiled water to replenish the water lost during exercise, which is both hygienic and refreshing.

(7) Exercise methods vary depending on each person's occupation and environment. People who are sedentary and lack physical labor in their daily lives must choose a simple form of physical exercise.

(8) After exercising, special attention must be paid to avoiding getting cold and catching a cold; this is most easily overlooked by those who engage in exercise. However, getting sick from exercise is not worth the loss and is not worth it at all.

Of course, there are many other things to pay attention to, which cannot be described in detail here. The above is just a casual listing of a few points that should be paid attention to as a health warning for exercisers.

Colloquial Medical Talks

### A Brief Discussion on Blood Transfusion

— Qu Shaoheng

In underworld slang, money is called "blood." Having money is called "having blood," and having a lot of money is called "having a lot of blood." Therefore, borrowing money is called "borrowing blood," because money is very useful, and without money, nothing can be done. As the saying goes, "A living person is a dead man without money in his hands," which is true. In medicine, someone with insufficient blood is called anemic, and in society, someone without money is called poor. Poverty means deficiency. When a person has little money, they are poor, and if they are so poor that they cannot maintain their livelihood, they should borrow money to alleviate their urgent need. When a person has little blood, they become ill, and if they are seriously ill and on the verge of death, they should also borrow blood to save their life. However, most people in the world are clear about the principles of borrowing money but are ignorant of the meaning of borrowing blood. Therefore, they may be generous and willing to lend money, but when it comes to borrowing blood, they are often hesitant and reluctant. They do not realize that a healthy person donating a little blood is like a drop in the bucket and does not cause them any pain or distress. Why be stingy and unwilling to do it? Now, please allow me to briefly describe the medical significance, effectiveness, and methods of borrowing blood.

Borrowing blood is blood transfusion. The application of blood transfusion in medicine has a long history. However, due to a lack of knowledge of serology at the time, it only increased unnecessary sacrifices. It was not until the rapid progress of modern serological chemistry that the phenomenon of homologous blood cell agglutination was discovered (Schattock, Donath, Landsteiner, Grukbaum, etc.), and the great achievements of Jausky, Moss, Dungern, Hirschfeld, and others in discovering the four blood types in humans eliminated almost all the dangers of blood transfusion. Furthermore, Hustin, Weil, Ruck, Freud, and Lewisohn pioneered the indirect blood transfusion method of adding sodium citrate to the blood, making blood transfusion operations even easier. Now, let me discuss the details further.

The functions of blood transfusion are as follows:

(1) To replenish depleted blood vessels, thereby continuing to strengthen cardiac function and prevent shock.

(2) To enhance tissue respiration through the oxygen-transporting function of red blood cells.

(3) Not only can it provide various nutrients contained in plasma, but it can also introduce various endocrine fluids.

(4) It can also introduce immune substances to increase resistance to infectious diseases.

(5) To introduce blood coagulation-promoting substances contained in serum, thereby causing hemostasis.

(6) Blood proteins can stimulate the bone marrow and other hematopoietic organs to enhance function and promote the production of new blood.

There are two main methods of blood transfusion: direct and indirect.

(1) Direct Blood Transfusion: This is a method of directly transfusing fresh blood into the patient's blood without any manipulation. In theory, it is ideal, but there are many inconveniences in practice.

(2) Indirect Blood Transfusion: This is a method of adding sodium citrate to the blood to make it non-clotting before transfusing it. This method is simple to operate and can be implemented by anyone. Therefore, I will describe a simple implementation method:

Selection of Blood Donors: Blood donors must not have leprosy, tuberculosis, syphilis, malaria, or various infectious diseases. It is best if they are of the same gender and similar age.

Determination of Blood Type: Not only humans, but all vertebrate sera have the property of dissolving foreign red blood cells (hemolysins) and causing them to agglutinate (hemagglutinins), and often have the effect of dissolving (homologous hemolysins) and agglutinating (homologous hemagglutinins) red blood cells of the same species. During blood transfusion, if the red blood cells of the donor undergo lysis or agglutination in the recipient's body, it will cause serious transfusion reactions (Transfusionserscheinnng) and even death. Therefore, it is essential to observe whether the donor's blood cells can be mutually compatible with the recipient's serum. There are two methods for determining blood type: using standard sera and not using standard sera.

A. Method Using Standard Sera

Human blood types are broadly divided into four groups, but the methods of classification vary among scholars.

Jansly I II III IV

Moss IV II III I

Dungern

und O A B AB

Hirschfeld

Collective Origin O A B AB

Collection AB B A O

J and M's methods are prone to errors, so the D and H methods are generally preferred. D and H's methods use uppercase Latin letters to represent red blood cell agglutinogens and lowercase letters to represent serum agglutinins. There are no identical agglutinogens and agglutinins in the blood of the same race, so no agglutination reaction occurs. However, if blood from different races is mixed, an agglutination phenomenon will immediately occur.

Now, assuming that A and B sera are used as standard sera and the unknown blood cells are mixed with them, the blood type of the unknown blood can be determined. The method is to first take a drop each of A and B sera at both ends of a glass slide and add an unknown fresh blood sample to each. Then, shake the glass slide back and forth several times, and the presence or absence of an agglutination reaction can be checked within five minutes.

If agglutination is found in B serum, then the blood of the subject being tested is type A. If agglutination is found in A serum, then the blood of the subject being tested is type B. If agglutination is found in both A and B sera, then the blood of the subject being tested is type AB. If no agglutination is found in either A or B serum, then the blood of the subject being tested is type O. Therefore, type O is generally preferred for blood donors, and type AB is generally preferred for blood recipients. In other words, type O blood can be given to everyone, and type AB blood can be received from everyone. The relationship is as follows:

B. Method Without Using Standard Sera

(1) Nurnberger's Three-Drop Method: Place a drop of 10% sodium citrate on a glass slide, then add a drop each of the donor's and recipient's blood, mix them, and observe for an agglutination reaction. A negative reaction indicates the same type, and a positive reaction indicates different types.

(2) Mandelstamm's Four-Drop Method: Place a drop of distilled water on a glass slide, add a drop of the recipient's blood to cause hemolysis, then add a drop each of 5% sodium citrate and the donor's blood, mix them, and observe for an agglutination reaction.

The amount of blood taken from the blood donor: The impact of the amount of blood lost on the overall condition varies depending on the race and physique. The amount of blood taken from Chinese people should be limited to around 500 ml. Therefore, when a large amount of blood transfusion is needed, at least two blood donors should be prepared.

Recently, there are organizations that supply blood transfusion by collecting several volunteer blood donors, and in addition to pre-screening for blood-borne infectious diseases, they also predetermine the type of blood, so that when there is a need for blood transfusion, they can summon suitable donors at any time. This is similar to the meaning of pledging items and whether they are compatible, which is truly an action that should not be delayed or postponed.

### Public Announcement to Physicians, Midwives, and Nurses

— Shanghai Medical Association

The Association is currently planning to compile and publish a "Directory of Physicians in Shanghai." We are issuing survey forms to physicians, midwives, and nurses to fill out. However, we fear that the investigation may be incomplete and omissions are inevitable. Any physicians, midwives, or nurses practicing in this city who wish to have their names included in this directory, please notify the Association at No. 25 Chi Bang Road after seeing this announcement, so that we can send you the survey form. This is a special announcement.

### Vitamin C Therapy for Pneumonia

— Sun Huiying

Although the use of vitamins for various diseases other than specific deficiency diseases has been widely practiced, it is now gradually reaching the stage of criticism. The author has used vitamins A, B, C, D, etc., for various diseases, and considers the most effective to be 10, B for traumatic nerve obstruction, and pneumonia. After a confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia, inject 0.020 grams (mg) of Vitamin C at the same time. Then, inject 200 to 500 mg daily. It is better to administer it in multiple injections than to administer a large dose in one injection. This Vitamin C injection can promote defervescence and diaphoretic antipyretics. Usually, when treatment begins, the fever subsides immediately, and the patient's subjective symptoms are significantly alleviated. All patients with anxiety, loss of appetite, and cyanosis, although their physical symptoms have not yet changed, their food and conversation are quite vibrant. This therapy can also shorten the course of bronchopneumonia, and is effective in preventing postoperative pneumonia. In addition, it is also effective for hemoptysis, cholecystitis, pyelonephritis, morning sickness, etc. (Excerpt from Yu's Research Laboratory Reading Group)

### Germany's Future Direction

— Mao Lie

If Germany does not know when enough is enough and calls it quits, and if the great powers do not inflict a serious blow on it to make it retreat in the face of difficulty, then Germany's desires will only grow day by day, and its acts of aggression will only increase without end, until a second world war breaks out, which will then stop.

Now that Austria has been annexed and Czechoslovakia has been partitioned, what is Germany's next move? Most obviously, it has already made economic demands on Romania, and its eyes are already fixed on Romania. Romania certainly has a sense of overwhelming fear. Everyone will naturally think that it is about to strike against Romania.

According to the British "Greenwich Times," Germany will demand its pre-war colonies and sovereignty over Alsace and Lorraine from France in the near future.

In addition, there are certainly other possible speculations.

I am not a prophet, nor am I a political scientist familiar with international affairs. But I also have some opinions on Germany's future direction.

In my view, Germany's current goal is to restore the position it had at the beginning of the European War more than twenty years ago. Its initial method is to annex the small countries near it. Austria and it share the same race and culture, and were allies before the European War, so it wants to annex it. Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia originally belonged to Austria, so it wants to annex them. Then, Hungary, which originally formed a united kingdom with Austria, it will naturally want to annex even more. Its most recent destination seems to be Hungary.

It is true that Hungary already listened to Germany's demands last year and was restricted to being an agricultural country, and its army has become insignificant. However, it is still an independent country. If Germany wants to do something in the East, even if it is the nearby Romania, it must first completely annex and digest Hungary completely. Otherwise, with Hungary sandwiched between it and Romania, how can it be at ease? Some people say that Germany allowed Hungary to invade Carpathian Ruthenia of Czechoslovakia, not out of love for Hungary, but merely using Hungary as a tool to take it later as if from an outer treasury. This can also be used as collateral evidence for what I said.

It is certainly a natural trend under the current circumstances that Germany has demands on Britain and France. But it does not seem to have reached that point yet. It must solve the small countries nearby one by one before launching against Britain and France. As for advancing eastward against Russia, even if this were to happen - I don't believe it - it would definitely be after it has solved all kinds of problems with Britain and France.

"Befriend distant states and attack those nearby" is a principle that Germany understands very well. However, its "befriending" is not about jade and silk, but about intimidation and deception. It will continue to proceed according to this principle in the future.

### Escape

— Ding Di

Escape?

Bang bang… bang bang…

Gunshots? Doesn't sound like it… Gunshots don't have that sound. A box cannon… no! …Artillery then? This is inside the city. Street fighting, huh, there's no artillery! No! …Lower down… lower… lower, lower. Head, a burst of dizziness… ah! It’s just my ears ringing, not gunshots. Haha! Good fortune! No need to be timid!

Opening the drawer, Director Wang took out a cigar. Strike! A streak of fire. Pff! The spittoon rang once, then fell silent again.

The Pacification Squad leader is quite something; even though he, himself, lost a concubine, now that the Director is in his pocket, with the Director around, does he need to worry about not enjoying beautiful women? …Too haggard! The only flaw, a scar, under his left eye, badly disfiguring him! -- Might as well send him a short Japanese girl... Good fortune, the old saying is right. The ×× people are coming, if I don’t run, I’ll actually get an official position, isn’t that good fortune?

Don't think about those frustrating things! Director Wang, puffing out wisps of smoke, narrowed his eyes; the mahjong tiles from the Central × Club, jumped into his eyelids, exquisite, smooth, beautiful. I should get myself a set!

…Slaughter tax regulations, must be drafted tomorrow… Tomorrow! Can't delay any longer… But tomorrow… the news is bad… Tomorrow! Damn it! Guerrillas! Bandits! Seeing a fortune right in front of my eyes… Tomorrow, what to do? Draft them or not? …

Outside the window, ah! Shadows are moving… Could they have entered the city? Guer– Guer– Guerrillas…

Murmurs... rustling… rustling… A mouse's slender tail, twitches and then curves. Gone into its hole… Gnawing on what? …

Is it a mouse? No? Voices––People on the street?

In the smoky shadows: Several hundred strong men. Boom… boom… boom——Oh! The county government office has been blown open… Run– Run…

The shadow of the window is moving… Steady yourself! Pull the curtains tight, a red flower on the curtain… Red is the most detestable… This is blood, blood, blood. Don't look! -- He calls Wang Sheng to make tea:

"Wang Sheng! Wang Sheng! You idiot! Did you go to sleep? Hmph! It's only twelve o'clock!"

"Wang Sheng! Wang Sheng!"

A wave of darkness before his eyes.

Head spinning! Bad luck! Sigh! Compose yourself! Staring wide-eyed, holding his head in both hands, he looks--

Ah! Ah! The light is out! Out? What's going on? Who's joking around? Hmph! It must be Little Hu, fiddling with the switch. "Hey! Little Hu! Little Hu!"

No response. He goes into the main room; the whole family is asleep. Quiet.

"Hey! The light's out! Don't you know?… The light… the light… Damn it!… What is this!"

The family all wake up, terrified, huddled together, crying, shouting, hugging, struggling.

Teeth chattering, body shaking, Old Master Wang trembles like a sieve.

Someone comes to find out from the street, Wang Sheng says:

"The electric wires have been cut, the whole city is dark. They're in a panic!"

Ping ping ping… Gunshots? Ears throbbing?… Director Wang shivers, shivers, his teeth chattering.

A red candle is lit. The red of blood, the red of the candle, how terrifying! A faint glimmer, trembling and flickering, high—low. Heart—falling, pressing down, floating.

Aren't those gunshots?

Run—

### He

— Ying Jin

He could certainly be considered a patriotic youth.

Every morning he absolutely had to sing "On the Songhua River" twice, but he would also follow it with one rendition of "When Will You Return." Three months ago he started shouting, "I'm going to the interior!" but he ultimately never left.

The fact that he "never left" naturally had its reasons: for example, his mother wouldn't allow it, he didn't have enough travel money, and he didn't have any companions, etc.

But in the past few days he's started shouting again, as if from the ashes:

"Really, I absolutely must go to the interior! Staying here will grind away my will!"

Then he says to every friend: "If I go to the interior, could you help me out with some travel money?"

"Of course! But has your mother already given you permission? And do you have a companion?"

"That doesn't matter!"

But, one day, two days… quickly passed, and he still lived there.

If someone were to ask him:

"Why haven't you gone to the interior yet?"

Then, his reply would be—

"I'm not going; because there's work to do in Shanghai: for example, in the next hour I have to attend a reading group, and in the hour after that I have to attend a literary symposium."

Having said that, he lowered his head, and used that "Parker" vacuum-filler pen to start writing:

"Books to buy this month: Popular Philosophy, Methodology, Outline of New Philosophy, Complete Course in Dialectics, Lectures on Political Economy, On Political Parties, Primer of Leninism…"

This month quickly passed again, and it didn't seem like he bought so many books, so a busybody asked him with a dubious attitude:

"Have you bought all the books you were supposed to buy this month?"

"No. —Alas! Books are simply too expensive to buy!"

But every morning, the items placed on the glass plate under his pillow were still: four slices of buttered toast and a cup of steaming hot coffee with milk. And the item most recently pressed under the glass plate was precisely that list of "Books to Buy This Month."

### The Lazy Gardener

— Written by Jian Qing

### Must Leave

— Geng Zhi

There are certain places one "must visit," and after arriving, one "must speak." However, one must never stay long; one must leave! At the very least, one must leave before the gathering breaks up; or at least after someone else has already left. Otherwise, I'd just be like anyone else. How would I demonstrate my value!

You can say that there's a meeting elsewhere, that I have to go to, so I have to take my leave. In any case, no one will investigate whether there's actually a meeting elsewhere; even if there's a meeting elsewhere but it hasn't started yet, you can always wander around in a small alleyway, or linger at any interesting place. You can always say that there's a banquet elsewhere, that I can't miss, so I'm sorry to leave this gathering. Anyway, no one is following behind you, and if you haven't eaten enough, if you're hungry, just go home and eat some leftovers, or even better, just have another proper meal at home, why not.

The wonderful uses of this, of course, I don't need to say more; everyone knows. I myself have repeatedly expressed my sincere envy to these "busy people" or "important people" who must leave at gatherings or banquets, thinking that they really are the chosen ones of heaven, the pillars of society, so everyone needs them, and they are temporarily running late, so they must leave.

Similarly, a traditional doctor—now called "physician"—can also sit in a sedan chair—now taking a chartered car or automobile—and drive around the streets all day long, showing that his business is booming and that he has many house calls. As soon as he arrives at a patient's house, he puts three fingers on their pulse, or takes out a stethoscope, and immediately leaves. That is to say: before going to a patient's house, he must leave, must go to many places; after going to a patient's house, he must leave, must leave early, and in this way, this traditional doctor or physician can become a "famous doctor" or a "national expert."

Similarly, a teacher can teach several courses, and when one course is still a few minutes from being finished, he can roll up his textbooks and leave. A talented person does more work, the students will surely think that.

Similarly, a courtesan going out to a banquet to offer drinks, as soon as the erhu sounds and she sings a couple of lines, someone outside calls for her to move to another gathering, and so she "rests for a while." Tsk tsk tsk, indeed a courtesan, the people at the banquet will surely say that.

Similarly, similarly, … the other possibilities are endless.

However, the "must leave" mentioned above all emphasize time, although it is effective, but the path that one "must take" also cannot be ignored, otherwise one might fail to consider everything, and the result would be imperfect.

First, one must take "shortcuts" like the Zhongnan Mountains. In the past, people who wanted to become officials only had to live in the Zhongnan Mountains, declaring their lofty purity, and the emperor would summon them to the capital and reward them with high office and great wealth. Now, the Zhongnan Mountains may be too far away, not fashionable, so one might as well understand it spiritually and use it flexibly. The simplest thing is, as long as you have money, naturally go to the "Zhongnan Mountains" abroad to live for a while, and a "sacred edict" will come down. In addition, whether you charge forward or carefully hone your skills, as long as you accumulate certain qualifications in a certain field, you can still become an official, so any field can become a "shortcut."

Second, one must take the "main road" on the surface. It is said that a certain moralistic scholar of the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras became famous for "not taking shortcuts," although one day he encountered rain in the countryside and jumped over a ditch, and was seen by a shepherd boy, to whom he gave some money, telling him not to tell anyone, but he was still not harmed in his being a gentleman who "must take the main road." So, those who want to become famous today can make a show of acting according to the rules or broadly giving and helping the masses, anyway no shepherd boy will see you, and if he sees you, and you give him some money, he will surely be endlessly grateful and proclaim your great virtue to everyone.

Third, it seems that one can also take the miraculously effective "inside line." The inside line is an extremely thin and subtle thing, how can one take it? However, many people take it, and its effectiveness is also the greatest. Because it is said that lines can connect things, so by relying on them, you can also achieve your goals. However, since there are many people on the line, and it is easily broken, those who take it must be especially careful.

In addition, certain paths must have certain ways of taking them, and it is also necessary to mention them briefly in order to see the full picture of "must leave."

When you see refugees, close your eyes and walk away; when you hear about national affairs, cover your ears and walk away; when you see a young woman, "follow her with your eyes and offer blood" as you walk away; "fox trot" in a certain place, "hot pot" walk; when you hear that the capital is seeking highly talented people who "do not seek fame," run on the road; if you become an official, walk with escorts under the pines, sit in a sedan chair among the flowers; when you hear that there is a great fortune to be made somewhere, walk like ants attached to something; … Most importantly, when you encounter danger, when there is a difficult task, then quickly use the best of the thirty-six strategies, which is to leave! Of course, these ways of "leaving" are all "necessary," if you want to take the various paths mentioned above.

But these are the ones that others must take, but for me, there is no road to "take," no method to "take," and I "leave" because I have no choice, then "must" it be the jianghu!

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

Twelve: Town Chief Chen's Hidden Pain

Battalion Commander Ye's troops had by this time retreated to Fenglin Town, twenty li northwest of Hapu Town. Fang Hui, along with the medical team and the people, took the wounded soldiers and spoils of war, searching all the way until the morning of the next day before finally rejoining the group. When she told her brother about the clever way she ambushed the enemy in the middle of the night, Battalion Commander Ye's staff, who were listening nearby, all praised her endlessly. Staff Officer Zhu was particularly happy, repeatedly exclaiming:

"I must record this glorious deed. Although we are temporarily isolated from above, the central government will definitely send a senior official to the guerrilla area to organize and contact us. At that time, I can report this matter and ask him to issue a commendation."

"Why bother? She's just a child. If she accidentally killed a few enemies, it's nothing to be proud of," Battalion Commander Ye said modestly.

"No, no," Staff Officer Zhu said seriously, "Miss Ye's actions, showing both intelligence and courage in wiping out enemy troops, is precisely the most outstanding material in our history of resistance. Our resistance is a war of attrition. If we can take one of them for one of ours, we've already made a profit. Now, she's killed three of them, and we haven't lost anyone. Isn't that worth a commendation?"

Battalion Commander Ye stopped saying anything. He was busy deploying defenses in Fenglin Town to prevent the × army from pursuing and attacking, and at the same time sent people to Hapu Town to gather information. The messengers returned and reported that the × army had captured Hapu Town, known as "Little Shanghai," and seemed to be satisfied, now busy with burning, killing, raping, and looting. For the moment, there was no intention to continue the attack. However, one thing that surprised everyone was that Chen Zhaoqian, the town chief of Hapu Town, had actually surrendered to the × army and came forward to serve as the chairman of the puppet "Maintenance Committee."

"Really, you can know a person's face but not their heart! I never thought that Town Chief Chen, such an honest and trustworthy person, would actually risk such a great disgrace and take on the false position of the 'Maintenance Committee.' I will never again trust the gentlemen of the world so easily," Battalion Commander Ye said angrily.

Cai Hefeng, the owner of Hefeng Lumber Company, also fled with the troops. He and Chen Zhaoqian were close friends for many years, and when he heard that he had become the chairman of the "Maintenance Committee," he was also somewhat skeptical. He originally wanted to return to Hapu Town to see if his lumber company was still intact, so he came to see Battalion Commander Ye and said: (38)

### Commemorating the "Shanghai Liberation"

— Liu Feng

Today, as Shanghai becomes an "isolated island," and as the War of Resistance enters a new stage, we, the four million compatriots of Shanghai, commemorate the "Shanghai Liberation." How profound and thought-provoking is this significance!

Thirteen years ago today, the National Revolutionary Army had advanced to Longhua. The workers and masses of Shanghai, as well as all patriotic citizens, in order to take action in response to the Northern Expedition and to end the rule of the anti-revolutionary warlords in Shanghai, at twelve noon on this day, the Shanghai General Labor Union issued the order for the second general strike. The vast majority of workers in Shanghai participated in this strike. Next, an armed uprising began, immediately seizing the weapons of the military police and occupying various districts, and attacking the Zhili-Fengtian Allied Army stationed at the railway station. After two days and one night (from noon on the 21st to 6 p.m. on the 22nd) of fierce street fighting, the anti-revolutionary warlords were ultimately defeated and driven out of Shanghai by the heroic struggle of the workers and masses of Shanghai and all patriotic citizens!

We cannot ignore that the National Revolution at that time was anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, so the armed uprising of the workers and masses of Shanghai was merely a heroic expression of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. Of course, this anti-imperialist and anti-feudal task was not completed at that time, and in today's War of Resistance, we must complete it under the task of resisting × and resisting traitors.

What lessons did the "Shanghai Liberation" of March 21st teach us? In a word, it is: The power of the people cannot be underestimated! In other words: Truth cannot be overcome by any brute force, conversely, any brute force can only collapse and perish under the great power of truth. This is the most fair and also the most ruthless iron rule laid down by history!

Before the armed uprising of March 21st, there were two other uprisings in Shanghai. After the failure of the second uprising, the demon Sun Chuanfang used cruel methods to massacre the workers and masses of Shanghai and all patriotic citizens, using broadswords to kill revolutionary leaders and patriotic citizens who distributed or read leaflets. A Shanghai person in their twenties can still imagine what it was like at that time in Nanshi and Zhabei: heads hanging from electric poles, corpses lying beside the roads, and brutal "so-called broadsword teams" patrolling the streets incessantly. …

However, did the demon's means of intimidation deter all the patriotic citizens of Shanghai? No! Not only did it not, but the demon instead ended his tyrannical fate under the heroic struggle of all the patriotic citizens of Shanghai!

Today, Shanghai has become an "isolated island." The lives of the four million citizens of Shanghai are even worse than they were thirteen years ago. However, Shanghai had the glorious "3·21," and this glorious "3·21" was created by the patriotic citizens of Shanghai! Therefore, today, as we commemorate the "Shanghai Liberation" of "3·21," we should invigorate our spirit of "3·21" a hundredfold or a thousandfold. Under the belief that "resistance will surely be victorious, nation-building will surely succeed," we must continue to struggle. Then, will the second "3·21," the second "Shanghai Liberation," not arrive soon?

Fellow citizens of Shanghai! We commemorate "3·21." From now on, let us invigorate our spirit of "3·21" a hundredfold or a thousandfold. Truth is on our side, and light is about to come!

### Miscellaneous Talks on the European Situation

— Fo

There May Be Even Worse Than This

Hitler violated the Munich Agreement, invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia. The countries of Britain and France realized that they had been tricked by Mr. Hitler, and that his last words about territorial demands were completely lies. So everyone condemned Hitler, saying that he disregarded good faith and broke his promises. But Mr. Hitler's attitude was very calm and indifferent, thinking that "Let them laugh and scold, I'll do as I please." My friend, Mr. Someone, once traveled to Wulin. The spring sunshine was bright, and he was boating on West Lake. He saw a monk teasing a young woman on the shore of West Lake. Mr. Someone pointed at him and laughed, saying: "You thieving monk, you also want to flirt with women?" The monk heard this and replied: "Not only flirt, there may be even worse than this." Now, Hitler's reply to Britain, France, and other countries is probably the same, not only Czechoslovakia, there may be even worse than this.

Chamberlain Built Millions of Pagodas

Because Hitler broke his promise, Mr. Chamberlain gave a speech in Birmingham the other night, in which he exaggerated the merits of the appeasement policy. He said, "The first purpose of my visit to Germany was finally achieved. European peace was preserved because of this trip. If not for this trip, millions of families in Europe today would be crying." Indeed, if Mr. Chamberlain had not gone to Germany, the war would have already begun, and it is impossible to know if millions or tens of millions of lives would have been destroyed. Our custom says, "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda." Mr. Chamberlain has truly accumulated immeasurable merit, I wonder how many millions or tens of millions of pagodas he has built; but the higher Mr. Chamberlain's merit, the more pagodas there will be in the world, and the world can truly be peaceful from now on, and Mr. Chamberlain's great accomplishment will thus be completed.

### Hard On Dad

— Yan Hua

"listen,Darling"

A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Production Premiering at the Cathay Theatre

Since Freddie Bartholomew first displayed his quiet, silent, and special style of a young English boy in "David Copperfield," this rising child star with a beautiful face has been loved by movie fans around the world.

Afterward, he starred in the equally moving "Captains Courageous" and "Kidnapped," confirming Bartholomew's character and personality on the screen. That is: he is good at playing children in aristocratic families who do not fully understand the ways of the world and are very kind in nature, as in "David Copperfield" and "Kidnapped."

If Bartholomew continues to develop with such a personality, although it has already become a fixed role for him, his future success is limitless.

But in "Hard On Dad," Bartholomew, who has always appeared in a silent, quiet, and noble style, has completely changed his personality. Look at him: he is so rude and reckless, so naughty and garrulous. In it, he plays the nephew of a gas station worker. He helps his little girlfriend, her mother finds a lover. The whole story is immersed in pure and fantastic fantasy. It is written through a romantic comedy about the remarriage of a mother with children. On the surface, it seems like an educational film, but in reality, it is a bizarre and fantastic love interlude.

Formally speaking, this film raises a woman's issue, which is, after a husband dies, the wife does not receive any inheritance. She has two children who need education and a large number of bills to pay at home. In this situation, what should a wife do? We believe that this is not just a woman's issue, but a social issue as a whole. In a society like this now, who can answer this question? If we are more optimistic, we can offer two points: (1) the mother finds a job; (2) the children are sent to a public school. But what if the mother cannot find a job and the children cannot find a general public free school?

Even if we take a step back, this problem is indeed unsolvable, especially in this money-worshiping society. Women's issues are originally part of a serious social problem!

However, in the hands of Hollywood writers, these serious problems are easily solved, that is, to let the wife remarry a husband. If the person she finds is not one she likes, then her children will help her to get together. And the translated title "Hard On Dad" that has been turned over by advertisers, if you look at the current plot, it would seem more accurate to change it to "Hard On Mom"!

Movie art, which bears the important mission of education and culture, falls into the hands of such film writers, which is indeed a cause for sighing.

In order to grab the audience, the playwrights had to exaggerate the form of comedy, turning Bartholomew, who has always maintained excellent performance, into a clown-like naughty child. When he questions the young lawyer about whether he has a family or is engaged, it will indeed make the audience laugh. Then add Judy Garland, who is good at singing, and that cute little brother Scotty Beckett, etc., so that this tragic story is covered up by a strong laugh.

The script is not very complete, and the appearance of the insurance company chairman can simply be deleted.

In the performance section, the director tries his best to create jokes, such as deliberately adding many small gimmicks when Brett gives a speech; Billy, etc. encounter a skunk, causing people to cover their noses and pass by; all of these serve as the center of the jokes in the whole play.

Bartholomew still works quite hard, but I personally feel that I don't like him playing this almost clownish role. Judy sings three or four songs in total, and the others, such as Mary Astor, who plays the mother, and Walter Pidgeon, who plays the lawyer, etc., because there are not many scenes, the impression given to people is also very weak.

### How to "Pass the Time"

— Xin Liang

Everyone has "free time"; students have it after class and homework is finished, the remaining time is "free time"; workers have it after all the work is done; even petty traders who live day to day may not be without "free time," look, aren't they often playing cards on the street? Thus, even the busiest person has "free time." Because of "free time," there is what people call "passing the time," which is how to spend this "free time."

Speaking of "passing the time," some people may immediately think of smoking, drinking, whoring, gambling, and other bad habits, as if there were no other ways to pass the time. They all say, "It's just a little entertainment." Thus, day and night, they only know how to go to skating rinks, dog racing tracks, and dance halls to hold women and seek stimulation. This way of passing the time, is it more appropriate to say it's killing time, or is it wasting time?

In Shanghai, there are countless people who have fallen because they have been infected by this kind of passing the time. However, in fact, there are many other good and healthy ways to pass the time. In short, whether "passing the time" is beneficial or not depends on the individual's ideas. Below, I will introduce you to several slightly meaningful ways to pass the time, which can not only increase knowledge but also cultivate the mind and body.

Clipping Newspapers

This way of passing the time is really interesting, and its excitement is no less than playing mahjong. Or, perhaps some people will say that this kind of passing the time is too troublesome. After reading the newspaper every day, why bother cutting them into squares and pieces? You don't know that newspapers are a record of people's lives and are indeed worth cutting out and preserving. Therefore, clipping newspapers is not limited to important news, commentaries, special articles, essays, new poems, and other photos, even advertisements can be cut out and pasted in old notebooks for you to browse from time to time and treat as a kind of "passing the time." If you have your own work published in the newspaper, then this kind of newspaper clipping work will be even more interesting.

Collecting Stamps

The history of stamp collecting as a pastime in the minds of Chinese people is not long. Until recently, this interesting pastime has been transmitted from Europe and the United States, and old stamp stalls and stamp societies on the streets seem to be easier to find and more numerous. Indeed, stamp collecting is beneficial to the body and mind, especially helpful for our historical and geographical knowledge; each red and green stamp, with beautiful and moving pictures, can tell you about the customs, human feelings, geography, culture, language, and everything else in that country. Although this kind of pastime is a little more aristocratic than the previous one, and genuine stamp collecting also costs some money, the interest and benefits gained from stamp collecting can offset the price paid.

Needless to say, everyone knows that China today is opening up a path in a difficult environment, and this work is naturally difficult. Then, how can every citizen waste time with bad pastimes? In today's era, filled with calls for "frugality to save the country" and "donation movements," can we still tolerate those useless and harmful pastimes of whoring and gambling?

Chapter Six: Praising Rui's One Seed Growing Three Beautiful Flowers, Narrating Friendship, Two Talents Meeting Heroes

Zhu Ai'ren lived in a house with her adoptive mother, Old Doctor Zhang. The house was near the hospital, a three-story building in a semi-Western style. The house was not large, just enough to use, but the yard was not small, with some trees, rocks, and flowers. Zhu Ai'ren knew that the two Miss He's were coming, so she cleaned up two rooms next to her own room for them to live in. She had long known that they would not want to live in the Freedom Village in solitude. Even if they wanted to go to Freedom Village, it would be best if she accompanied them. Although Zhu Ai'ren's mother lived in Freedom Village, wasn't she a simple and rustic old farmer who could not deal with these two Miss He's? At this time, Zhu Ai'ren's car drove straight into the yard of her own home. At that time, the setting sun hung on the treetops, and the sky was not completely dark. In front of the steps, seven or eight people had come out to greet them. They all knew that these were Zhu Ai'ren's classmates in the United States, a pair of twin daughters surnamed He, who had just arrived from Hong Kong. Ai'ren had gone to Suzhou Station today to meet them, but the two Miss He's did not recognize who these seven or eight people who came out to greet them were. Even if Zhu Ai'ren introduced them to them one by one, they probably would not remember them clearly for a while. It turned out that most of these seven or eight people were doctors from the Women and Children's Hospital. Some lived in Old Doctor Zhang's house, and some did not live in Old Doctor Zhang's house. They heard that Zhu Ai'ren was going to pick up two new guests today, and these two new guests were a pair of twins, so they all had to come and see them. Zhu Ai'ren also briefly introduced them to the two Miss He's at the time, knowing that they would not remember them clearly for a while. Fortunately, they would be familiar with each other in a few days. The two Miss He's also went to see Old Doctor Zhang, who was also very welcoming. Because Zhu Ai'ren had told her about them long ago, knowing that they were Zhu Ai'ren's good classmates, and had said for a long time that they would come here to visit Ai'ren, she naturally had to fulfill her responsibility to entertain them. Moreover, Old Doctor Zhang was very amiable and kind, so they became very close at first sight. She said, "We have many places where we are afraid that we will not be able to entertain you well, please forgive us. Because Ai'ren and I are very busy with medical affairs. I am in charge of the entire Women and Children's Hospital and the nursery, from the general manager to the general affairs, I have to ask about everything, and I can no longer manage things like seeing patients and delivering babies. All matters concerning seeing patients and delivering babies are managed by Ai'ren, and she also has to manage these people in the Women and Children's Hospital and these children in the nursery. She is really too busy for a while. Fortunately, the two ladies are very good friends, so don't be polite. (66)

### A Clear Sky for Ten Thousand Miles, the Chinese Air Force on the Silver Screen Soon

— Sha Luming

Since the soldiers and civilians of the whole country raised the great cause of resistance with the most heroic, resolute, and sacred posture; our air force not only gave the invaders a major and tragic blow, but also showed the world that the Chinese air force is great and brave!

Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the air force combat personnel will continue to give the enemy blows and defend their homeland's clear sky with a blitz posture. The Chinese air force is like a wonderful flower, in full bloom, completing its most difficult but most glorious task of crushing aggression and defending the motherland. Yes, the Chinese Air Force will continue to grow in these dual missions.

Now, we are even more gratified by the good news that the Chinese Air Force will be on the silver screen. Undoubtedly, it will write a brilliant page in the history of Chinese cinema.

Since the war, the staff of the Central Film Studio of the Central Propaganda Department have often traveled to the north, south, east, and west battlefields, and the tragic, magnificent, and touching facts of the front line have been shown to the vast audience in the rear through the lens, film, and transportation. Now, there is also a film with the theme of the air force, "A Clear Sky for Ten Thousand Miles," which will be filmed soon. The screenwriter is Mr. Sun Yu, the director of "The Road." The Central Propaganda Department had previously consulted the Aviation Committee to send personnel to jointly participate in the filming, directing, and technical work. The Aviation Committee sent the fake airman Xie Taojun to assist. Xie Jun once said:

"...When he (referring to Sun Yu) sincerely buried himself in the screenplay of this film, I helped him by telling him some stories about the Chinese Air Force, and various issues about air force driving and combat technology. I am a pilot, I don't know how to write a good script, but I know how to fly a plane, how to fight the enemy, and how to defend the airspace of my motherland: I want to contribute these things to the film industry. Also, I want to correctly tell the struggle, bravery, and heroic sacrifice of my partners. These are what the screenwriter is going to use as the object of his description..."

This film "A Clear Sky for Ten Thousand Miles" is indeed an epoch-making and great significance event in the history of Chinese cinema. Here, we pay the most sacred salute to all the staff of "A Clear Sky for Ten Thousand Miles"!

Looking back at our "isolated island" film industry, it is a time when the atmosphere of demons is spreading. How should the film industry workers strive to rise up at the crowing of the rooster? We should not only maintain the progressive spirit of the past, but also develop this spirit, with a new uncompromising spirit, strive to struggle, and strive to fight!

### Shirley Temple Happily Raises Rabbits

— Bu Zhi

Is Shirley Temple a "genius"? No, she just has a mischievous personality like other children. However, the talents of mischievous children are probably smart. Shirley Temple's "intelligence" can be used by her environment and education, so she seems smarter than other children! If she didn't have the help of a good education and a good environment, I'm afraid that to this day, or even until she died, she might still be an unknown person, like other children who have buried their intelligence; from the perspective of determinism, Shirley Temple is indeed a lucky person in this world.

Shirley Temple likes to raise rabbits very much, but if you ask her "Why do you love rabbits," she can't answer, because she herself doesn't know the reason why she likes rabbits.

When Shirley Temple was just babbling "Papa" and "Mama," one day, her mother took her to the zoo to play. In that zoo, which displayed strange beasts and birds, her eyes were attracted by a group of colorful rabbits. She jumped in her mother's arms in surprise and joy. Why didn't she show such expressions when she saw tigers! Seeing lions, seeing jackals, wolves, leopards and elephants? Her mother thought that her daughter was destined to be with rabbits.

Later, at Shirley Temple's request, her mother bought many rabbit toys for her; leather, cloth, wood, and clay became decorations in her room.

As she grew older, a film director accidentally discovered her intelligence; she climbed onto the screen and became popular. At this time, because her monthly income was so rich, her mother built a paradise for her; everything about life, education, games, and career was prepared in detail. However, her mother forgot to open up a rabbit-raising garden for her, she didn't think that the child really wanted to raise rabbits.

As a result, Shirley Temple proposed

The first time, she only bought five rabbits. In a small corner of the garden, a small wooden shed was built to provide these five rabbits with sleep. Thus, Shirley Temple added another activity to her daily schedule; morning, evening, whether it was sunny or rainy, she had to go and see her beloved rabbits. Three months later, one morning when she went to see the rabbits again, she couldn't see any rabbits. She cried, she said that the rabbits were eaten by wild cats. But in fact, no, because the rabbits had reached the breeding season, they dug underground caves and hid in the underground to give birth to baby rabbits, so they were too lazy to come out at night.

Several days passed, and a large group of baby rabbits appeared in front of Shirley Temple. Breeding like this from generation to generation, now, there are hundreds of rabbits on her field, and the area of that rabbit circle has also been expanded for the sake of needs. In the past, Shirley Temple herself went to feed grass to the rabbits, but later she also hired someone to take care of the rabbits to replace her work.

Now, raising rabbits is very developed in Shirley Temple's career; society has given her the honorary title of "rabbit raising expert."

Just looking at rabbit raising, we can prove that the environment and education used Shirley Temple's intelligence to make her a lucky "genius."

Chen Yunshang Goes and Comes Again

The southern beauty Chen Yunshang came to Shanghai to star in "Mulan Joins the Army," and unexpectedly her reputation spread and she became famous in one fell swoop. The second film, "Fairy Yunshang," is a new type of song and dance film, which will also be completed soon. Previously, she was originally from a song and dance troupe that had been in this field for a long time, so this film "Fairy Yunshang" is even more able to show her strengths and is another good show.

On the Hong Kong side, three companies, "Qiming," "Nanyang," and "Minzu," had previously signed a five-film contract with her, which she had to go back and film. Therefore, after the work on "Fairy Yunshang" is completed, she will "return to her hometown" and come back again.

The third film in Huacheng Company's plan, I heard, has been set as the costume film "Romance of the West Chamber," and plans to bring together three major stars—Hu Die (Yingying), Jin Yan (Zhang Sheng), and Chen Yunshang (Hongniang) to co-star. Because Hu Die is living in Hong Kong and does not want to return to Shanghai; after acting in "Yang Guifei," she will still film in Hong Kong.

Tan Ying Moves Out of Taoyuan Village

Tan Ying had just moved into Taoyuan Village on Lafayette Road two months ago; her "husband" Cheng Bugao has been on a long expedition to Sichuan and Shu for many years, and had also returned to Shanghai for a trip. Recently, because the "second landlord" suddenly topped the house, changed to a new owner, and had to take it back for self-occupation, she suddenly moved the scene again to another place.

Finding a house is the most difficult problem at the moment. Because Tan Ying looked for it and couldn't find a suitable residence; in the absence of any way, she could only temporarily open a room in a foreign apartment on Avenue Joffre and Albert Road. At the same time, her old mother and a younger brother also rented a pavilion building for them elsewhere, as another settlement.

She said: "Living alone in an apartment is not only too lonely, but also extremely inconvenient. Now I still want to find a more suitable house."

Gu Lanjun Sells Flowers and Gives Photos

Gu Lanjun and her sister Mei Jun are both addicted to flowers, so for the sake of selecting relationships; they had already opened a Mei Lan flower shop at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Dahua Road, specializing in selling all kinds of beautiful flowers. Such sharing of fragrance and helping each other's beauty is such an elegant and rhythmic artist's anecdote. These days, Miss Lanjun's new film "Wu Zetian" is being shown at the Great Shanghai Theater; she is quite satisfied with this film herself, so she specially prepared a large number of Wu Zetian stills and distributed them to customers at the Mei Lan flower shop every day. According to her, "At the same time, it is also for the Mei Lan flower shop to have been open for just one year, and it is regarded as a memorial." In this way, her beautiful gift has a double meaning!

### Ye Sheng Lan et al.'s Strange Reunion

— Xi Tong

Ye Sheng Lan's "Strange Reunion" is famous. I remember a few years ago, I watched him and Hua Huilin co-star in "Writing a Petition" at the Xin Guang Grand Theater, which was warm and delicate, making it difficult for me to forget until now. "Writing a Petition" happened to be scheduled after the lively martial arts show; this joy was like finding an oasis in a desert, with green grass and flowing water - this will become my eternal dream.

In order to pursue this dream, I specially went to the Golden Grand Theater a few days ago to watch Ye Sheng Lan and Xing Eyun co-star in the full version of Strange Reunion. (In fact, it is still only the latter version, because it starts from Crying in Prison) But such a dream can no longer be obtained! Can a big dream only be allowed to stay in memory forever, and cannot be pursued?

Ye Sheng Lan's advantage is: After Gui Zhi took the stage and sat down, she cried. He lowered his head slightly and stared at Gui Zhi with his eyes, so-called half-love and half-resentment, which can best express this kind of expression; I heard that the warden was opened by Gui Zhi, although he said "Hey," he still took a gentle tone in the reprimand, indicating his deep love for his wife; it wasn't until he said "How can this be" that he really got angry: like this process from joy to anger, the change is extremely natural and pleasing. Secondly, speaking of "Wait for me to go and ask her" without pulling the hem of her clothes (actually, the clothes are split in two), he just pulls the sleeve of his right hand with his left hand, and points at Gui Zhi with his right finger, which is also quite concise and emotional. Furthermore, speaking of "Your father has another way to make a living," he patted Gui Zhi's shoulder kindly, which was also very realistic. Finally, being teased by Gui Zhi, he stood up and walked in solemnly like it was a big deal, which was more interesting and novel than bending over, pointing, and saying "How can this be."

But Sheng Lan also has shortcomings, that is: when singing "After listening to my wife's words, my heart is bitter," the word "bitter" does not have a lingering sound. According to Cao Xinquan's score in Volume 4, Issue 12 of the Drama Learning Monthly, the gongche of this sentence's bitter word should be "shang chi gong liu chi gong liu shang chi shang si he si." (Eyun also has the same singing sentence, but she didn't make a mistake) Also, "He and I, Zhao Chong, are just as similar," the tempo seems too fast. Secondly, in the "Breakthrough" scene, crying too much is also somewhat unreal.

Eyun's acting is very good, her voice is also sweet, but because she has been performing "Killing the Family of Fishermen" and this play continuously, she is naturally exhausted, so she can't fully concentrate. When Sheng Lan sang the passage "After listening to my wife's words," she turned her back to the outside of the stage, which is unreasonable. If she can't hear Sheng Lan's words, then how did she say "Is your husband also driven out by his stepmother?" I think this cannot be blamed on Eyun alone. Many people who perform Peking Opera have this problem. That is, they don't treat the play as a serious art, but are casual. When A sings, B doesn't care, either drinking tea or resting, breaking the realm of integration and connection. After being pulled into the government office, Eyun's panicked expression was not fully expressed, and she should have looked dazed, not bowed.

Li Qi, played by Guan Shengxi, was successful, with good singing and acting, and especially good crying, but his old age was not perfect, which was a fly in the ointment.

### Anecdotes of the Amusement World

The rehearsal of the Second Edition of Wensu Chen by the Yifeng Drama Society at the Carlton Theater has been postponed again and again, because the content still has room for deliberation. Yesterday, Zhou Xinfang and Zhu Juechang had another precise discussion. When the reporter asked when the rehearsal would begin, Xinfang replied that although the date was not far away, there was no definite date yet.

The Xinji Grand Stage rehearsed the thirty-third episode of Journey to the West for the first time the night before last. The martial arts student Xu Yunting's foot injury has healed, and he will return to the stage after the play is finished.

The thirtieth episode of the Honglian Temple at the Gongwu Stage began rehearsing the night before last. Kun Dan Mao Jianqiu will take a rest from today and join when the new play is premiered.

The Tianchan Stage has suspended performances for two days starting yesterday. The famous Dan Huang Guiqiu is scheduled to return to the stage tomorrow night.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden of the Old Capital (125)

Talking about the Relationship between Empress Dowager Cixi and An Dehai because of Visiting Her Mother's Exit from the Pass

The play "Silang Visits His Mother" has been popular in Bangzi and Peking Opera troupes for hundreds of years. Yu Shuyan's grandfather, Yu Sansheng, became famous for this play in the past. Later, Guo Shichen (i.e., Old Yuan Yuan Hong), the Taidou of Peking Opera with a mustache, won the appreciation of musicologists with his tragic and desolate tune. Therefore, the excerpt of "Visiting Mother" almost became a famous play known to every household in the Tongguang years. In fact, the "Visiting Mother" of the Peking Opera troupe was indeed derived from the Bangzi troupe. When the King of the Performing World, Tan Xinpei, widely adopted the strengths of various schools and formed his own school, this play became even more famous in the world; and the person he admired the most at the time, in addition to the predecessors of the Peking Opera troupe, Cheng Chang Geng, Yu Sansheng, Wang Jiuling, and others, also worshiped Guo Baochen, who was on par with him, like a heavenly god. In many of his translation tunes, we can find the charm of Bangzi opera. From this, we can guess how much he admired the sad sound of Qin Opera, and how he used his wit to extract the essence of Guo's tune and install it in the "crying head" of Xipi and other mournful sounds to stimulate the audience's hearing, often making the audience shed tears. At that time, it was collectively called the sound of national subjugation. Unexpectedly, this kind of sound of national subjugation can not only spread north and south and be popular for a while, but also endure for a long time and still be so strong today. For example, the play "Visiting Mother" has almost become the Tan School's most popular play in various theaters. Xing Eyun and Yang Shisen's trip to the south this time, in less than a month, they have repeated it three times, and each time the attendance rate is above 90%. This also shows the strong appeal of the play and the fact that people who appreciate music attach great importance to it. I have always liked to explore the relationship between the characters in the play and the history of our country. Now let me write out the name of the "Pass" in the "Exit" scene of the play "Visiting Mother" for my friends to study, and I will also incidentally narrate a secret history of the Empress Dowager Cixi of the late Qing Dynasty and the eunuch An Dehai (i.e., Little Anzi, who was very popular for a while), because the origin of Empress Dowager Cixi's favor of An Dehai was because he had risked his life to break through this pass and saved the lives of the Empress Dowager and her son, and according to an old opera fan in the military, this pass was the pass that Yang Silang passed through in those years; in fact, the story of the "Yang Family Generals" is not reliable at all, and when plays such as "Visiting Mother" and "Yanmen Pass" are choreographed, it is even more unbelievable, but people all have the common problem of "manufacturing historical sites" and "attributing words to them." Let's assume that "Yang Silang's exit from the pass to visit his mother" is a real thing, then, the inference of the old opera fan in the military can be considered quite accurate, because he is an old military man over sixty years old, who served as a platoon leader under Wu Luzhen, and later became a division commander. He not only has knowledge and loves to watch operas, but is also very familiar with history and geography. This "pass" is a place where he once lived for a long time. He inferred based on ancient and modern geography and resolutely said to me: "If Silang's exit from the pass is really such a thing, then the pass he passed through is the current Gubeikou."

### Finance Retail Investors Dump, Cash Price Initially Stable then Falls

Falling to a Closing Price of 2058 Yuan

Yesterday, the spot market for "cooked red" (refined gold) was initially quite stable. Although many small investors, seeing the uncertainty in Europe, actively sold, a certain gold firm was eagerly buying, so the situation remained relatively stable. In the afternoon, the gold firm's appetite waned, and the selling pressure did not decrease, so the market weakened, falling to a closing price of 2058 yuan. As a result, it fell another eight yuan. Confidence among all parties remained weak, but trading was still active, with about 770 taels traded. Jewelry gold was also marked down by a small amount of one yuan. Customs gold remained stable. Central Bank pure gold, etc., rose slightly.

"Cooked Red" Falls Eight Yuan

From the morning, no trading occurred for each bar (ten taels). Around ten o'clock, a certain silver firm sold fifty taels to a money exchange business for 2069 yuan, an opening price three yuan higher than last weekend. After the opening, the money exchange business immediately resold it to a certain gold firm at the same price. Subsequently, the silver shop group made fifty taels between themselves, and the gold firm sold fifty taels to the silver shop group, both at 69 yuan. After this, although a certain gold firm continued to buy, the money exchange business acted on behalf of local customers to sell, so the situation was slightly weak. The gold firm then bought fifty taels from a securities firm for 68 yuan. A cash shop sold twenty taels to a money exchange business for 67 yuan. Later, the gold firm bought another fifty taels from the money exchange business for 66 yuan. At that time, the money exchange business's willingness to sell waned, so the underlying trend stopped falling and turned upward. The money exchange business made fifty taels between themselves for 67 yuan. The gold firm then bought fifty taels from the money exchange business for 70 yuan. By then, it was 11:45. Near noon, the money exchange business sold another fifty taels to the silver shop group for 67.5 yuan. The underlying trend weakened again in the afternoon, due to continued active selling by retail investors and waning buying interest from gold firms. First, the money exchange business sold fifty taels to the gold firm for 64 yuan. Then, it sold another fifty taels to a fellow business for 65 yuan. Later, the money exchange business made fifty taels between themselves for 62 yuan. After a while, the money exchange business sold fifty taels to a customer for 60 yuan. By then, it was 3:45. Later, at 4:05, the money exchange business made thirty taels between themselves for 2058 yuan, the closing price for the evening, eight yuan lower than last Saturday's closing price (having fallen for three consecutive days for a total of 38 yuan), with a daily range of twelve yuan. The cash shop's own-brand gold was sold at 2065 yuan and bought at 2050 yuan. The spot gold was still quoted fifty yuan lower than the list price, but there were no trades.

Jewelry Gold Down One Yuan

The price of jewelry gold at silver shops was initially unchanged due to the relatively stable trend of "cooked red." Around 4:10 in the afternoon and evening, as "cooked red" weakened again, the price was also marked down by a small amount of one yuan. Da Tong Heng quoted 209 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng quoted 207 yuan, buying at 0.01 yuan less.

Customs Gold Unchanged

The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash has risen to 1212.6 yuan. The listed price for customs gold remained unchanged, at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard spot gold price also rose by 0.3 yuan, due to London's telegram on the 18th that British pure gold rose by half a pence per ounce.

### Exchange Rates for British and American Currencies Rise, Buying Sentiment for US Dollars in this City Subdued

The exchange market yesterday saw a sudden reversal and rise in the exchange rate between British and American currencies, which immediately subdued buying sentiment for US dollars in this city. Although foreign firms had a relatively high demand for settlements mid-day, the large influx of selling orders telegraphed from Hong Kong and the increased selling interest from foreign banks caused the situation to briefly rebound to 16.09375 yuan, but ultimately there was no significant change. Although foreign firms also came to settle British currency, the abundant supply from Hong Kong telegrams and British banks such as HSBC kept the situation quite stable, and it remained fixed at 8.25 pence. There was little change that day, and trading was still active. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, the intense buying by foreign firms initially weakened the underlying trend to 55.125 yuan, but the increased selling interest from Chinese banks caused it to rebound to 55.25 yuan, resulting in a tightening of 0.125 compared to last weekend.

In the morning, London's large amounts continued to contract by 0.25 for the near term and 0.125 for the long term. New York silver prices remained stable, London bullion rose by half a penny, exchange rates for British currency against American currency rose by 0.7, against French currency rose by 0.3 centimes, and against Shanghai currency remained unchanged. American currency rose against British currency by 0.125, against French currency rose by 0.0625, and against Shanghai currency remained unchanged. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with selling prices of 8.25 pence for British currency and 16.0625 yuan for American currency, with no changes compared to last weekend. After the opening, although major foreign firms had some settlements, the abundant supply from foreign banks kept the situation quite stable. Foreign firms settled with HSBC for British currency at 8.25 pence and also bought US currency from a certain bank for 16.0625 yuan. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax announcement continued to fall by 0.0125, assessed at 5.00%. After this, a sudden influx of selling orders telegraphed from Hong Kong slightly strengthened the underlying trend. Hong Kong telegrams sold US currency to Youli for 16.09375 yuan. Subsequently, foreign firms suddenly bought Hong Kong currency intensely, causing the situation to weaken. Foreign firms bought Hong Kong currency from Netherlands Chinese Bank for 55.125 and 55.25 yuan. At the noon closing, the bank's selling price was the same as the morning opening.

In the afternoon market, foreign firms settled with HSBC for British currency at 8.25 pence and then bought US currency from a certain bank for 16.0625 yuan. Subsequently, Hong Kong telegrams sold British currency to Youli for 8.25 pence and US currency for 16.09375 yuan. Finally, foreign firms bought Hong Kong currency from Chinese banks for 55.25 yuan. The situation was also stable. At the evening closing, the bank's selling prices were 8.25 pence for British currency and 16.0625 yuan for American currency. As a result, compared to last Saturday's noon closing, British and American currencies remained unchanged, while Hong Kong currency weakened by 0.125.

Japanese Currency Widely Distributed

Last Saturday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the exchange rate between British and American currencies rose by 0.125. Yesterday, foreign exchange in this city was still in strong demand from foreign firms, and the supply from banks was very abundant. The American currency once loosened, and as a result, there was no change compared to last Saturday. The opening price of "cooked red" was still stable, but later, there was very active closing of positions. The gold firms, money exchange businesses, etc., did not absorb smoothly, and the price trend was slightly weak. In the afternoon, retail investors flooded the market more actively, and buyers became even scarcer, and the market price fell sharply, and the lowest price closed, and the trend was very weak. Due to the weakness of spot gold, British and American gold pounds were sold slightly actively, and the market price fell more. Foreign banks accepted American dollar bills quite smoothly. Due to the slightly weak confidence in foreign currencies, most of them fell. Transactions in Japanese gold notes were quite active. New notes such as one yuan and fifty sen (Japanese gold note half yuan, etc.) were widely distributed in the market, and transactions in the guild were still active. Chengtai sold and Qin Tai bought fifty American gold pounds. Changtai sold and Hongchang bought fifty British gold pounds. Dingyuan sold and Yongtai bought one hundred British gold notes. Sentai sold and Yongtai bought two hundred American dollar bills. Huitong sold and Hongchang bought fifty British gold pounds. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell by 0.3 yuan, British gold notes fell by 0.05 yuan, American gold pounds fell by 0.2 yuan, American dollar bills fell by 0.008 yuan, Hong Kong notes fell by 0.005 yuan, French franc notes fell by 0.075 yuan, Canadian notes fell by 0.03 yuan, Philippine notes fell by 0.02 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.

Discount Rate Rises Repeatedly

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts and notes rose slightly. Initially, it was still 50 yuan per 1,000 yuan, rising to 50.025 yuan at noon, and continuing to rise in the afternoon, finally reaching 50.05 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan compared to last Saturday.

(Shanghai currency is the amount equivalent to 100 Hong Kong paper dollars in Shanghai legal tender)

Securities: Europe Has Many Accidents, Domestic Debt Declines, More Than Two and a Half Yuan Lower Than the Highest

The securities market was weak. Due to the tense situation in Europe, many superficial bulls flocked to sell, so the market price has been depressed for several days, falling by more than 2.5 yuan compared to the highest price. Both types have broken the 50 yuan mark. If the European situation shows any signs of improvement, the market price may rebound.

Yesterday's progress: No. 16 and Tiansheng Lemao, etc., sold at the opening, while Maoda and Tongkang were the buyers. Large investors were not active, and the market price tended to be weak. In the afternoon, Nos. 11 and 16 and Xieda sold, while No. 4 always bought. Runli and retail investors also absorbed some, but the supply still seemed to exceed the demand. Type C broke the 50 yuan mark, and then fell by a small amount of 0.45 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall by 0.065 yuan to 0.09 yuan. The transaction volume was about 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category  Highest  Lowest  Closing Price  Compared to Previous Day
Type A  57.00  56.10  56.10  Down 0.90
Type B  51.00  50.20  50.20  Down 0.75
Type C  50.75  49.90  49.90  Down 0.70
Type D  49.30  48.70  48.70  Down 0.65
Type E  49.80  48.85  48.85  Down 0.75

Stock trading: More than 80 Nanshi Huashang Electric shares were traded, with a price of 5.4 yuan.

### Metals Raw Lead and Iron Face Spot Shortages

Raw lead and iron have traditionally been mostly sold to factories in this street. Over the past week, merchants from Tianjin have been frantically purchasing them because the exchange rate is favorable, with more than a thousand boxes traded. The price has risen from 42 yuan to 45 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton Alarming Surge in the Price of Single Yarn

32-Count "Celestial Maiden" Jumps 20 Yuan

The yarn market remains stable, but the price of 32-count fine yarn is surging dramatically, with a momentum rarely seen in the market. This is mainly due to the spring and summer season, which has slightly increased demand in the Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan areas. Furthermore, traders, seeing the shortage of spot goods and the small number of spindles in operation at the factories, are pushing up the price even more vigorously, frantically searching for it in the market. As a result, the market price is mutually raised higher. The price of 32-count "Celestial Maiden" single yarn has jumped by 20 yuan, to 570 yuan. It is found that the price of 42-count "Celestial Maiden" double-ply yarn is instead 545 yuan, 25 yuan lower than the price of single yarn. The situation suggests that someone is manipulating it. However, this kind of surge is too violent. According to the market, factories are all switching to spinning single yarn because the price of 20-count yarn is mediocre. It is important to guard against a reversal in the future. Moreover, it is found that last year, the highest peak price of 32-count single yarn was 570 yuan, at which time the price of 20-count yarn was around 480 yuan. Based on this situation, it is inevitable that yarn factories will switch to spinning single yarn. In the afternoon, the price of 32-count "Celestial Maiden" single yarn rose another 3 yuan, to 573 yuan, a surge of more than 21 yuan compared to Saturday.

The situation for spot yarn: At the opening in the morning, traders gathered and found the yarn market still calm. However, the demand for fine yarn, 32-count, from the Zhejiang area was brisk, causing tension in the market. The opening price of 32-count "Shepherd" was 6 yuan higher than the previous day. In a flash, it jumped 20 yuan. The price of 20-count yarn was boosted by 1 yuan due to the sharp rise in the price of single yarn. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" was 366 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 392.5 to 393 yuan. In the afternoon, the yarn market rose slightly by 0.5 yuan, but the price of single yarn rose another 3 yuan. It is found that the total amount bought by various traders throughout the day was 1,905 bales. Market prices: 20-count "Double Horse" yarn rose by 2 yuan, and the rest also rose by 1.1 to 1.2 yuan, but the prices of 32-count and 42-count fine yarn rose by 5 yuan to 20 yuan. The amounts of spot yarn bought by various traders are recorded on the left:

Fellow traders: 1,115; Ningdu: 80
Shantou: 185; Hong Kong: 32
Fuzhou: 25; Yunnan: 110
Hunan: 30; Xiamen: 30
Inland: 20; Total: 1,905

The situation in the Japanese yarn market turned weak, due to selling by traders from Tianjin in the north, dropping slightly by 1 yuan. The spot price of 20-count "Water Moon" yarn was 340 to 339 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn was 330 to 329 yuan. Demand from other areas was very low.

Yesterday, 385 bales of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, 285 bales to Hong Kong, 175 bales to Guangzhou Bay, and 595 bales to Haiphong. Today, 820 bales will be shipped to Shantou, 70 bales to Hong Kong, and 50 bales to Fuzhou.

### Egyptian Cotton Plummets Seven Yuan

Manufacturers Still Watching, Local Cotton Business Turns Quiet

The prices of foreign cotton have long been observed by this newspaper. Yesterday's price drop in New York was affected by the serious situation in Europe, but the main reason was actually the widespread rumors of the release of loan cotton and the government's adoption of export subsidies for cotton. As a result, traders were extremely panicked, and various parties sold off, causing cotton prices to feel quite weak, falling by 7 to 13 pence per pound. Due to the sharp drop in Liverpool and the news of the release of American loan cotton, combined with forecasts, Indian cotton plummeted by more than 3 rupees. Egyptian cotton plummeted by more than 70 pounds. Yesterday, the exchange rate loosened slightly. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices fell by 1.1 yuan per dan (unit of weight) for American and Brazilian cotton, 1.35 yuan per dan for Indian cotton, and a sharp drop of more than 7 yuan per dan for Egyptian cotton.

The Shanghai market for foreign cotton: Factories did not buy because of the sharp drop in foreign cotton prices, and various parties planned to watch the overseas cotton market for a considerable period of time. However, yesterday's price of fine yarn soared, and Tianjin's fine velvet cotton, although offered at a good price, was still purchased from the south. Therefore, it is expected that factories will slightly purchase long-staple foreign cotton within the day. Yesterday's foreign cotton prices are recorded below:

Raw Material  Category  Delivered to Factory, Including Tax
60-Count Egyptian Cotton, High Grade 104.05
Same, Middle Grade 101.10
80-Count, High Grade 127.45
Same, Middle Grade 117.30
20-Count American Upland 83.70
Same, Low Grade 70.60
32-Count, 92.45
Same, Low Grade 81.55
42-Count, 94.25
Same, Low Grade 82.45
South American Brazilian Cotton, High Grade 99.10
Same, Middle Grade 84.95
Same, Low Grade 78.30
10-Count Indian Pingguoer 60.45
16-Count Indian Omra 65.25
20-Count, 69.35
24-Count Indian Bairuche 76.00
32-Count American Xin te 81.95
32-Count, 42-Count American Pengjiapu 86.40

The local cotton business has turned quiet, really because prices are too high, and the prices of American and Indian cotton cloth have fallen sharply again, causing calculation prices to become cheaper day by day. Manufacturers are naturally choosing the cheaper options over the expensive ones, and the position of local cotton has mostly been encroached upon by them. However, the amount of local cotton in stock is not enough to supplement it. The market price of cotton traded yesterday was still as firm as ever and never loosened. The source of supply from the Subei area is still low, with a total of 555 bales of Nantong fine velvet cotton. The sales market prices and amounts of spot cotton are listed on the left:

Nantong Cotton 80.00 yuan; Yuanyihao bought 103 bales; exchange transfer, warehouse delivery
Changshu Ink Seed 74.00 yuan; Fellow trader bought 400 bales; same
Fire Machine Cotton 71.00 yuan; Same, 102 bales; cash, same
Same, 71.50 yuan; Same, 20 bales; same

Industry and Commerce Discussion

### Don't Go for Cheap Deals Anymore, Honestly Switch to Wearing Domestic Cloth

— Fushi

I have been an employee in the woolen industry for nearly thirty years, from apprentice to now. I don't know how many changes the woolen industry has gone through. To put it simply, it is just as Mr. Zhifeng said in the previous Japanese publication "From a Historical Perspective, Talking About the Shanghai Woolen Industry." Later, this publication also published Mr. Tang Jun's "The Woolen Industry Cannot but Plan for Itself," which made me very emotional. Even those in the woolen industry feel the same way, so I will dissect it to clarify the situation.

(1) Since the Japanese disguised as "Allied Bank" issued counterfeit currency to seize legal tender and exchange it for foreign exchange, the authorities had no choice but to implement foreign exchange controls. Woolen imports have become difficult. 95 out of 100 cases are settled through HSBC Bank (according to the Central Bank, each national currency yuan is 1 shilling and 2.5 pence, while HSBC Bank only settles at 8.5 pence), causing the cost to suddenly increase by more than one-third (i.e., before the war, the cost per yard was 6 yuan, now it is 8.35 yuan). How can the price of goods not skyrocket? Moreover, at the beginning of the war, in order to stabilize their businesses, woolen traders sought to cancel orders that had already been placed, and either postponed or temporarily stored those that had already been shipped in Hong Kong. No one could have imagined that the market in the isolated island last year would develop so abnormally. Although woolen goods had been ordered, the number was limited, and distant water cannot quench immediate thirst, resulting in a panic situation of demand exceeding supply. At that time, the standard market price was like gold, rising three or four times a day, and it was stated that all transactions were in cash. Therefore, after the big end of last year, all stores, large and small, made money. This is not unique to the woolen industry. Moreover, the woolen industry's profits last year were certainly not exactly as reported in this newspaper. There are bound to be some discrepancies. We can only take it as a general idea.

(2) Mr. Tang Jun said: The cheerful faces of the woolen industry last year were due to the generosity of neighboring gangs, and also said that they did not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, which is a bit too much. This is what is called knowing only one thing and not knowing the other. It is found that the traders with the most profits last year were the "split cargo" gangs, such as Meifa Lianxing, Yichangtai, Shengda, Wangxingchang, and Yuchangxiang, etc. Not a single inch of enemy goods entered their doors. Even high-end clothing stores also abandoned them. Let's go back to the topic. Some sales are the result of stores catering to customers' psychology of seeking cheap deals, only listening to the price, only looking at the patterns, and not asking about the quality of the fabric or the durability of the goods. Naturally, inferior goods are the most suitable for sales. If we want to say it strictly, we can say that there would be no buying without selling, and indeed the seller is not innocent. But turning it around, if everyone does not buy cheap goods, the seller will have no way to sell and will not want to sell. Therefore, it can be said that both the buyer and the seller are equally guilty.

(3) On the other hand, the people on the isolated island are a mixed bag. Seeing that others were making money easily, long-established stores with reputations, such as Mou Tai, Mou Xiang, Mou Feng, and Mou Ji, as well as famous brokers and runners, such as Lu, Xia, Zhang, Chen, Yang, Cao, and others, were blinded by profit for a time and did not ask whether the goods they were promoting were woven from fresh blood and severed limbs. Because of the weakness of human beings to covet small profits, they made their fortunes at the expense of friends and family, pleasing the enemy and hurting loved ones. This is why I admire Mr. Tang Jun's conclusion, and I earnestly hope that those in the industry who know their future happiness will quickly turn back, repent of their past mistakes, and think about the future of the entire nation and themselves. Do not only care about immediate interests and disregard the dangers and worries of the future. Open the window and speak frankly: those who already have considerable profits and assets should quickly wash their hands and stop doing things that sell out the happiness of their descendants. However, the ordinary small employees in the woolen industry still have a bowl of bitter rice to eat, but they are full of national consciousness and arouse conscience, unwilling to covet cheap deals, unwilling to get rich, unwilling to send money to others, and unwilling to make guns and cannons to attack our hometown.

(4) I would like to give a sincere advice to people from all walks of life: when buying or ordering Chinese and Western clothing woolens, please specify domestic products (most domestic woolens have a proof stamp on the selvage), pay attention to the "Yang Meiren" brand, and Yongxing Hongkang woolens are mostly woven in Shanghai, but are operated by people from a certain country. The store calls them "our factory goods." In short, do not covet cheap deals to avoid being fooled. As the saying goes, "Buy a cheap old ox, and two will fall in a year." If economic reasons make it impossible to afford durable Western woolens, it is better to honestly switch to wearing domestic cloth, which is most generous, most economical, and most durable. People will not make faces when they see it, and will even commend you as a thorough young patriotic person.

### Textiles Ningbo Exchange Rate Suddenly Rises, Purchase of Cloth Suddenly Weakens

Dyed Goods Are Strong, Large Quantities of Cloth Exported Yesterday and Today

The market for domestic cloth and dyed goods is strong. Lun Chang white dyed satin and white dyed croquet silk each rose by 0.1 yuan per bolt. Summer goods have opened, and printed non-fading linen is 14.4 yuan, and linen spinning is 13.8 yuan. Stores in this street have already started to purchase them. Traders from Hunan and Jiangxi are very active in purchasing colored cloth and dyed cloth. Fuchou is particularly active, totaling more than 4,000 bolts, most of which are transshipped from Wenzhou. Wenzhou traders have added more than 100 pieces of fine cloth of the Fugui and Jinfeng brands, and 200+ boxes of Fuchou, dyed cloth, dyed twill, colored cloth, and colored twill. The Ningbo traders have recently seen the Shanghai exchange rate suddenly rise to 23 yuan per 1,000 yuan, raising the cost of goods from Shanghai and making sales difficult, so their purchasing appetite has suddenly weakened. They have only purchased more than 100 pieces of scattered fine cloth, fine twill, Fuchou, and other goods. Guangdong traders are relatively active in purchasing colored twill, with 170-180 boxes traded. The selling price of white goods alone has increased slightly for fine cloth and fine twill, by 0.05 yuan. The price of coarse cloth remains stable.

Due to the continued popularity of dyeing and sales, the selling price of Dong Pi white goods is strong. Yesterday, the amount of fine cloth and fine twill added by the colored cloth shops and dye factories in this street reached about 1,000 pieces. Tianjin traders also purchased more than 400 pieces of fine cloth, with one brand of colored ball fine cloth accounting for 200 pieces. Therefore, traders unanimously expect the price to rise. Rixin Foreign Firm offered 300+ pieces of fine cloth for this month and next month, with the leading price being 12.15 yuan per bolt for Yang He and 12.2 yuan for Dongmian Foreign Firm. Dongmian Foreign Firm offered 200+ bales of "Double Fish" fine twill and "Blue Chicken" fine cloth, with the "Double Fish" twill being 11.5 yuan and the "Blue Chicken" cloth being 12 yuan per bolt.

Yesterday, 200 pieces of textiles were exported to Shantou, 500 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 465 pieces to Haiphong. And today, 2,400 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin, 540 pieces to Yantai, 110 pieces to Fuzhou, 740 pieces to Shantou, and 25 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Unmarked Goods Cannot Be Trusted, Marked Goods Become Popular

The woolens with Western characters on the selvage have become even more popular recently. Previously, they were limited to Western-style suits, but today they are popular for Chinese clothing materials. Looking at the clothing stores, woolen stores, and silk and satin shops along Avenue Joffre, Szechuan Road, Da Xin Street, Jing'an Temple Road, Nanking Road, and Honan Road, almost none of them do not sell woolens with characters. Taking the 42,000 number flannel as an example, the same quality costs 8 yuan per yard wholesale without characters, but 8.5 yuan with characters. And sales are more popular than those without characters, because they are easy to identify, which shows the determination of people to not use inferior goods.

### Food Wheat Flour Mostly Shipped North

Flour Market Little Falls on Plant Prices with Ocean Wheat Futures Trading a Ship

The wheat flour market has turned weak and falling, not only wholesale but also retail is not as lively as the previous two days. It is heard that the Nanyang gang, Quanzhou and other places, because a certain party has an attempt to move up Jinjiang, ships entering and exiting are inconvenient, so the demand is not strong, and the North Ocean gang is also affected by foreign flour, and actual sales are difficult to develop, and as a result, the price is reduced by five points, which started greed from the local guest, accounting for about 45,000 bags of flour of brands No. 2, 3 and 4, etc., No. 2 flour is all 4.65 yuan for the local guest, No. 3 flour is 4.6 yuan, No. 4 flour is 4.3 yuan, and No. 5 white bags are 3.8 to 4.6 yuan.

Yesterday, 4,500 bags of flour were shipped to Shantou, and today 18,000 bags were shipped to Tianjin, 7,000 bags to Yantai, 5,000 bags to Weihaiwei, and 8,000 bags to Fuzhou. In addition, 700 bags of wheat bran were shipped to Hong Kong.

The wheat market remains stagnant. Occasionally, there are sporadic arrivals, which are all taken by Japanese factories, or directly sent to the factory for pricing. There is no formal market. Only in the midst of the competition of foreign flour and wheat, futures have been traded repeatedly. Yesterday, it was heard that the street area has newly set up a ship of Australian wheat, totaling 7,000 tons, with a price of only 7.78 yuan, and the rumor that the flour factory continued to set up two ships of foreign wheat can also be confirmed.

### 河下 Rice Prices Rebound; Rumors of Orders for Foreign Rice

Yesterday, various merchant groups brought in a total of ten shipments from He Xia, with over two thousand packages transported by carts. The early market maintained some momentum from previous days and continued to show strong demand. Prices for thick and thin japonica rice increased by a few cents. In the evening market, speculators ceased their activities, and sales on this street also slackened, causing the market to turn sluggish. Du Yangjian rice and port japonica rice, along with Yuan rice variants, saw similar supply and demand, with no significant gains or losses.

Locally produced Xian rice saw strong demand from both retail customers and speculators. However, prices in Wuhu, the production area, were high, leading to an initial price increase of ten to twenty cents in the morning. Subsequently, large-scale speculators took profits and sold off their holdings, causing prices to fall back down in the afternoon. Ultimately, the increase was only a few cents.

The current price of foreign rice is stable at seventeen yuan and twenty cents, with little fluctuation. The market should be able to maintain this level for a while. However, since the sharp rise in the price of local Yuan rice, prices have been more prone to increase than decrease, remaining at the high level of around nineteen yuan for a long time. Therefore, it was rumored yesterday that grain merchants have ordered a total of 400 tons of Hong Kong foreign Yuan rice, glutinous rice, and green beans. It is said that the shipment can be registered within the week and 1,650 bags will be shipped from Hong Kong on the 20th.

### Silk and Tea: Daily Silk Prices Fluctuate Wildly; Limited Silk Transactions in Shanghai

Yesterday, the silk market in Yokohama continued to decline. The spot price was 1,035 yuan, a decrease of ten yuan from the weekend. The forward price was 968 yuan, a decrease of twenty-one yuan from Saturday. This shows that the fluctuations in the Eastern market are entirely caused by manipulation and speculation. Therefore, the price increases cannot be sustained for long, and the price decreases have no standard. It is regrettable that the local silk market has not been able to seize this opportunity and utilize it to promote exports. As a result, the recent rise and fall in the silk market in Yokohama (on the 17th and 18th of this month) has had little impact on the local market, which can only watch passively. The New York market was closed yesterday, and it is predicted that silk prices will also fall. This can be seen from the fact that the recent upward trend in forward silk prices has been weak, and the declines have been more severe. Furthermore, since the sudden increase in tensions in Europe, the sales of silk fabrics in Europe and America have been affected, indirectly suppressing the rise in silk prices.

Transactions in the local silk market are limited. Foreign firms are offering 1,730 yuan for Grade B78 white filature silk, but it is still difficult to close deals. Users are also hesitant to buy. Overall, people are taking a wait-and-see approach and not engaging in transactions for the time being. Therefore, the dry cocoon market price has also declined somewhat. The current asking price for local varieties is 310 yuan, and for foreign varieties, it is 410 yuan. Recently, there have been few buyers of raw silk. Yesterday, only the print shop made five loads of Zhejiang silk, it is said.

### Sugar Market: No Changes in Sugar; Over 5,200 Bags Arrive

Yesterday, there were no significant changes in the sugar market. The public association set a price of sixteen yuan and six cents for 24 lots of coarse white re-exported goods, but no transactions were made. Taikoo Grade B West Warehouse sugar was priced at twenty-four yuan and seven cents, and East Warehouse sugar was priced at six cents. National sugar included 50 packages of Chaozhou Xinghua and other local grades of top-quality ice white sugar, priced at twenty-three yuan and seven cents; 60 packages of ordinary Huanggang Qing sugar, priced at fifteen yuan; and a lower grade priced at fourteen yuan and eight cents. 60-odd packages of Mingjing red sugar were priced at fifteen yuan and three cents. 50-odd packages of Xinghua foreign sugar were priced at sixteen yuan and three cents. 40 packages of assorted second-grade white sugar were priced at eighteen yuan and two cents to eighteen yuan. Arrivals included 300 packages of carted white sugar and 310 packages of red sugar from Xiamen, 1,000 packages of carted white sugar from Hong Kong, and over 400 packages of Pianqing sugar traded in the dark at a price of eleven yuan and eight cents.

85 packages of sugar arrived from Beihai on the 20th; 2,400 packages arrived from Hong Kong; 2,185 packages arrived from Shantou; and 610 packages arrived from Xiamen.

### Oilseed Cakes: No Deals Unless Prices are Low; Groundnut Oil Market Declines Suddenly

Soybean Oil Initially Tight, then Eases; Small Soybean Cakes Flood the Market, Prices Remain the Same

Groundnut Oil: Yesterday, the groundnut oil market saw hints that shipments could arrive in Shanghai on the same day. However, bulls claimed that this was unfounded. Buyers were only willing to purchase at low prices, causing some people to panic. As a result, ten barrels of Dalian groundnut oil were sold at a price of thirty-eight yuan and fifty cents, a decrease of one yuan and fifty cents from the previous market. 50 pieces of Jiaozhou groundnut oil were sold at a price of twenty-nine yuan, a sharp drop of two yuan from last Saturday.

Soybean Oil: Due to the relatively stable situation in Dalian, the local market has not seen significant changes for the time being. The market was initially tight, then eased yesterday, with little overall fluctuation. The entire situation still depends on Dalian. Yesterday, 120 pieces of Yanqi oil were offered at a price of twenty-three yuan and four cents. There are currently 300 barrels of Dalian oil (details in the market price section); 300 barrels for delivery in seven days; 400 barrels for delivery in late March; over 1,000 barrels for delivery in April; and 200 barrels for delivery in May. 30 barrels of Fengnian oil and 100 barrels of bleached oil were also offered.

Soybean Cake: A flood of small Jiangbei soybean cakes arrived, with prices showing some differentiation. Other varieties saw very little change. 600 pieces of Dayou Four Brand cake were sold at a price of three yuan, forty-six cents, and four-sevenths cents. 500 pieces of Jiangbei small cake were sold at a price of three yuan and six cents. 5,000 pieces of Dalian Guang cake for delivery in April and May were sold at a price of three yuan, one cent, and five cents.

Today, 1,000 pieces of soybean cake will be shipped to Fuzhou and 5,000 pieces to Shantou.

Yesterday, 1,340 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong. Today, 1,500 bags will be shipped to Shantou and 2,250 bags to Hong Kong.

Common Knowledge of the Yarn Industry

### The Inside Story of Cash Transactions: The Issue of Delivery

— Written by Long Jusheng

As the saying goes, "Every magician knows tricks, but each has different skills." The business strategies in industry and commerce are as unpredictable and elusive. How much more so is the yarn industry, the "favored child of heaven," where cash transactions are intricate and complex! Like gold, it is "as precious as gold"! Like the "Eight Trigrams Formation" of Zhuge Liang in a dazzling array!

Having been in the yarn industry for over ten years, I am deeply familiar with the tricks of the trade. Therefore, I will describe "The Inside Story of Cash Transactions: The Issue of Delivery," which I hope will be of interest to those engaged in or concerned about this industry!

(1) Warehouse Receipt Goods

The price of warehouse receipt goods is two or three yuan lower than spot goods (also known as "gate pass goods"), and can even differ by as much as ten yuan per piece. Although customers still need to advance funds, some pay 70% in cash and 30% by remittance, while others pay 70% by remittance and 30% in cash. The more cash paid (or if it's all cash), the cheaper the price will be. Conversely, even for the same warehouse receipt goods, the price will be higher! This is because of discounting. Manufacturers treat warehouse receipt goods in two ways: (A) If the market price is low when the customer (yarn dealer) submits an order, it must be combined with higher-priced goods. (B) If the customer does not advance funds and take delivery within one week, the order will be canceled or assigned to another customer. (C) If the customer delays advancing funds and exchanging the warehouse receipt (for two or three days) after placing an order, the deposit will be forfeited. In short, there is no guarantee of obtaining spot goods with warehouse receipt goods (unless you pay an additional fee to exchange for gate pass goods, also known as "drawing cash"). Therefore, the purchase and sale of "warehouse receipt goods" is not very popular when the market is hot.

(2) Gate Pass Goods

These are goods for which the warehouse receipt has been exchanged for a manufacturer's gate pass (a warehouse certificate for immediate delivery), which can be delivered at any time. It is also known as "drawing cash." The price is five or six yuan to ten yuan higher than warehouse receipt goods. Those who are resourceful and have connections with the manufacturer can often foresee a rapid upward trend in the market and buy large quantities of warehouse receipt goods. They then pay a "cash extraction fee" to the manufacturer to obtain a gate pass and take delivery of spot goods, thereby taking the opportunity to speculate and profit. (Note that gate pass goods also require a gate pass number for allocation).

(3) New and Old Warehouse Receipts

The distinction between new and old warehouse receipts depends on the time the warehouse receipt was issued, not on whether the payment has been made, as Mr. A stated. Once a manufacturer's warehouse receipt has been obtained, the payment must have already been made. If the payment has not been made, the warehouse receipt cannot be obtained. The manufacturer's business practice is "payment first, then issuance of the receipt (warehouse receipt)," which is stricter than other industries, with no flexibility for "receipt first, payment later." Although "old warehouse receipts" can request delivery first, those purchased at a lower price will still be delivered later. Conversely, "new warehouse receipts" purchased at a higher price can still be delivered earlier.

(4) Approved Receipts

"Approved receipts" refer to situations where the customer has a "special relationship" with the manufacturer, and the head of the manufacturer's sales department or the managing director allows the warehouse receipt to be stamped with a special approval, ordering the manufacturer to deliver the goods earlier based on the approval and signature. Other customers often protest and make a fuss when they hear about this, but because the manufacturer's authority is supreme, there is nothing the customers can do.

As for Mr. A's statement that "if there is no one to receive gate pass goods on the market, the deliverer has no choice but to transfer them to a warehouse, incurring additional warehousing fees and labor costs..." that is not necessarily true. Those who take delivery of "gate pass spot goods" must already have a buyer, or the payment has been received and the goods are loaded onto a ship. Before the war, the shipping documents and insurance policies would be pledged to the bank to offset the debts and claims between the two parties. Therefore, "gate pass delivery" does not necessarily mean that there is no buyer. If we are talking about speculators hoarding goods, then naturally they must store them in a warehouse. After storing the goods in a warehouse, they can use the warehouse receipt to obtain a loan from a financial institution, use the loan funds to purchase more cotton yarn, and wait for a good price to sell it. This is like using one set of capital for two different purposes. If the opportunity is right and the market price is high, they can sell the goods immediately and make multiple profits, deducting warehousing costs and loan interest. A resourceful and skilled cotton yarn merchant can become wealthy with a single move. As the saying goes, "Long sleeves are good for dancing, and a good merchant is wealthy." The intricacies and unpredictable changes of the inside story are truly miraculous. It is truly "Every magician knows tricks, but each has different skills!"
