### Results of the Fierce Battle of the Southern Jin Army: Pinglu and Maojindu Both Recaptured; Over a Thousand Japanese Soldiers Killed in Action; Large Quantities of Military Supplies Abandoned; Stable War Situation in Central Hubei; Japanese Troops Near Qianjiang Encircled

Yuanqu (Front Line Telephone Report) After six days of fierce fighting in southern Jin, on the 8th, the Chinese army withdrew from Pinglu after inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. From the 9th to the 10th, multiple Japanese forces converged to attack Maojindu, with numerous Japanese aircraft repeatedly bombing the entire town of Maojin into scorched earth, and it was once captured. On the afternoon of the 10th, all units of the Chinese front line were ordered to launch a simultaneous counterattack with lightning speed. The Japanese were caught off guard, and due to their exhaustion and the Chinese army's fierce offensive, Maojindu was recaptured that evening. Subsequently, taking advantage of the victory, they advanced to attack Pinglu, and on the morning of the 11th, Pinglu was captured. The remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray, abandoning large quantities of military supplies and documents along the way. While pursuing, the Chinese army pacified the local population. In this battle, over a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed, and four mountain guns, one mortar, and hundreds of machine guns and rifles were captured, along with a large amount of other military supplies. After this major victory, the Chinese army's cheers echoed throughout the Zhongtiao Mountain valley. (11th Dispatch)

### Tianjin Japanese Authorities Prepare to Implement Blockade of Concessions; Japanese Merchants Have Completed Evacuation; Britain Unwilling to Extradite Suspects; Former Soviet Consulate Occupied by White Russians

(Tianjin) The local Chinese Association held an emergency meeting yesterday, resolving to urgently cable the British Foreign Office, explaining the importance of the Tianjin dispute, and urging the Foreign Office to continue to consider it. Responsible parties solemnly declared that the Japanese side has not delivered a final ultimatum to the British authorities. However, it is generally believed that unless some situation prevents it, the Japanese side is likely to implement a blockade of the British Concession on June 14th or 15th. Currently, all Japanese merchant firms in the British Concession have effectively completed their evacuation, and others are also rapidly evacuating. Judging from the current situation, there is no indication that the British side will soon agree to extradite the suspects in the Cheng assassination case to the Japanese side. The Tianjin branch of the Joint Reserve Bank is one of the major institutions ordered to evacuate completely as a final measure. At the same time, the Yokohama Specie Bank, which has moved into the Japanese Concession, is now asking foreign banks to settle and clear exchange bills with it, and has announced the temporary suspension of export and exchange business. It is reported that the bank has requested importing firms to guarantee that they will no longer unload goods in the British Concession after it is blockaded. (11th Reuters Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) A Tianjin report states that the Tianjin British Concession authorities have transferred Wang Qi and another man, who were allegedly found in possession of bombs, to the Japanese side. However, the Japanese side believes that the two men are not related to the Cheng assassination case and remains dissatisfied, claiming that the British side lacks sincerity. The two men were arrested in Xingheli, Da Jingchan Road, a month ago, and are both 21 years old. The case is not serious. It is generally observed that the British side may be adopting this compromise measure due to the strong stance of the Chinese side. (10th Dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Tianjin Japanese authorities have taken preliminary measures to isolate the British and French concessions. The branches of the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Joint Reserve Bank in the British Concession have both moved to the Japanese Concession. The Customs has also decided to take the same action. Forty-two Japanese residents in the British Concession and fifty-nine Japanese residents in the French Concession have completed their preparations for moving their businesses.

(Tianjin) The British Residents Association held a meeting here last night and passed a resolution urging the British government to take effective measures to protect the safety of British residents here when the Japanese block the British Concession here. The concession authorities here believe that the situation is extremely tense due to the strong stance of the Japanese side and the rapid evacuation of many Japanese residents from the British Concession.

### American Observer States Chiang Kai-shek's Strategy: Adopt a Defensive Posture to Extend the Japanese Line; Seek to Strengthen Guerrilla Forces; Then Implement a Large-Scale Counteroffensive

(New York) Mr. Mallory published an article in today's "Foreign Affairs" magazine, titled "Chiang Kai-shek's Strategy," discussing the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War. He stated that Chiang Kai-shek had formulated a detailed plan for the war of resistance before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. According to the article, his strategy is as follows: Adopt a defensive posture until the Japanese front line is extended to the extreme; During the period of reorganization of the Chinese army, strengthen the power of guerrillas to contain the enemy in the occupied areas; After the above two goals are achieved, implement a large-scale counteroffensive.

The article solemnly pointed out the necessity of China arousing the people to fight a long-term war. Mr. Mallory added that if Japan wants to rule China, it must occupy the concessions, but the article claimed that General Chiang Kai-shek also welcomes this move, as it will increase the opportunity for the powers to aid China.

### Two Batches of Twenty-Seven Japanese Planes Each Attacked Chongqing and Chengdu; Numerous Heavy Explosive Bombs Dropped in Chongqing; Losses in Chengdu Still Under Investigation; Rumor Has It That Five Were Shot Down

(Chongqing) Two batches of Japanese planes, twenty-seven in each batch, attacked Chongqing and Chengdu at around 7 PM today. In Chongqing, the Japanese planes entered the city's airspace at 7:15 PM, and after being met by the Chinese Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery, they dropped dozens of heavy explosive bombs indiscriminately before fleeing.

### First American Member of the Chinese Kuomintang Appointed as Organization Minister of the U.S. Branch

(New York) The first American to join the Chinese Kuomintang is American dentist Morris William. He is currently the Organization Minister of the U.S. Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang. In addition to his duties, he raises funds for medical supplies. In 1921, William wrote a book entitled "Historical Social Explanation," the theories of which were largely cited by Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China. Sun Yat-sen refuted the materialistic view of history in his Three Principles of the People, drawing heavily from William's book. William was admired by Sun Yat-sen, and therefore developed a strong interest in China's national movement. In 1936, William was introduced by Wang Zhengting, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, and became a member of the Kuomintang. According to William, Japan will never be able to destroy China. He also said that all countries in the world must treat China equally for their own benefit. If there is no help from China, the economic problems of all countries in the world cannot be solved. Finally, he said that if countries despise China's position, they will suffer the consequences themselves. For example, in 1931, countries originally planned to sacrifice China, but as a result, they only sacrificed the League of Nations. Although William is a member of the Chinese Kuomintang, he has not yet set foot on Chinese soil. It is said that he wishes to visit China this summer. (11th Reuters Dispatch)

### Japanese Government Decides to Implement Materials Mobilization Plan; Promote Consumption Savings and Increase Production; Intensify Control Over the People, Causing Hardship

(Tokyo) The Japanese Cabinet has decided on the national materials mobilization plan for this year. Although the detailed procedures are currently kept secret, it is generally believed that its characteristics are to vigorously expand the production of materials necessary for manufacturing munitions and developing Japanese export trade, and to intensify the control of the Japanese public's consumption of materials. The Miyako Shimbun reported that "The China Incident has caused the Japanese people to suffer greatly and feel many inconveniences. Fortunately, there is no shortage of food, because Japan can be self-sufficient. According to the new mobilization procedures, the control of many materials will be intensified, but if implemented carefully, it may not threaten the people. The previous allocation of materials was not smooth, causing friction in all aspects." (11th Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial

### Reviewing the Arguments for Peace

A certain country's ambassador to China recently came to Shanghai from Chongqing and was asked about his impressions of Chongqing. He said: The National Government has been in charge of the war of resistance for more than twenty months, and its hardships and sufferings are unparalleled in history, but it is still full of vitality and its belief in victory is unwavering. This is the most profound impression, which was completely unexpected. Someone who went to the occupied areas to sweep graves and returned to Shanghai was asked about his impressions of the trip. He said: Traitors are colluding and plundering, and the residents are filled with grief and indignation, with no way to appeal. Therefore, those who in the past did not know what the nation was, and did not know the value of law and order, are now all able to realize the indivisibility of national destiny and interests, and are aware that the war of resistance for survival cannot be delayed. They only hope for the restoration of light. These two accounts allow us to glimpse the attitude of the Chinese government and people. However, at the same time as hearing these two accounts, I happened to see the arguments for peace in a Hong Kong newspaper, which made me deeply feel the great difference in people's hearts. Please review them:

When reviewing right and wrong, some people think that there is no absolute. However, the truth will never be erased because right and wrong may not be absolute. The difference between seeing benevolence and seeing wisdom, and the distinction between entering as master and serving as slave, may seem to be in opposition. However, fragrance and stench will never be neutralized because of opposition. Moreover, there are things that are absolute and not enough to oppose! Some people call it promoting peace, others call it surrendering. When Wang Jingwei used the peace movement as a slogan, the National Government denounced him as plotting against the government and ordered his arrest. This is something that is not enough to oppose. Why? By objectively reviewing his arguments for peace, even without adhering to the National Government, one can make such a judgment. He said: The truth of advocating peace lies in the displacement of refugees, the suffering of compatriots in the occupied areas, and the increasing loss of territory. Therefore, considering the current situation calmly and peacefully, the only option is to promote peace. He also said: There are two ways to achieve peace, namely international mediation and direct negotiations. Those who expect international mediation are entrusting the fate of the nation and the people to others, so direct negotiations are appropriate. He also said: Direct negotiations should begin with declarations from both sides, expressing sincerity to each other, and then cease hostilities and negotiate peace. He said: This is an unbreakable truth. His fundamental idea is the so-called "There is no war that does not end in peace."

"There is no war that does not end in peace." This is as accurate a truth as "There is no one who does not die." If this is taken as a truth without asking about the timing or the conditions, only seeking peace and only seeking death, in order to implement this truth, then it is a fallacy that everyone can understand, without the need for much explanation. Speaking of timing, there should be no fixed conclusion. However, the advocate of peace is describing the military disadvantage by saying "refugees are displaced, compatriots in the occupied areas are suffering, and more and more territory is being lost." When the military is at a disadvantage, it is the time to surrender, not the time to negotiate peace. Speaking of conditions, the purpose of the war of resistance is to have the other party abandon its aggression, while the intention of the advocate of peace is to abandon the war of resistance. If the other party does not abandon its aggression and this side first abandons the war of resistance, then this is a condition for surrender, not a condition for negotiating peace. Even in terms of the displacement of refugees, the focus should be on rescuing the refugees, not concluding with seeking peace. In terms of the suffering of compatriots in the occupied areas, the focus should be on restoring sovereignty and administration, not concluding with seeking peace. In terms of the increasing loss of territory, the focus should be on recovering the lost territory, and the current situation in Peiping and Nanjing is not what is meant by recovering lost territory. Is the advocate of peace considering this calmly and peacefully? To say today that the only option is to promote peace, will it preserve territorial sovereignty and administration? Given these points, since the arguments for peace lack truth, then the so-called ways to achieve peace are even less worth discussing. Following his argument, if the way of international mediation is to entrust the fate of the nation and the people to others, then today's Japan still regards itself as the victor, saying that China should entrust the fate of the nation and the people to Japan through direct negotiations? This is proven by the National Government's "vitality, unshakeable belief in the war of resistance," and further proven by the explicit order for Wang Jingwei's arrest. It can be known that the National Government will continue the war of resistance, has neither expected international mediation nor prepared for direct negotiations. The Japanese side has also repeatedly expressed that it will not take the National Government as its opponent. In that case, if the direct negotiations advocated by the advocate of peace do not first destroy China's political organization, they will have no way to implement the advocacy of direct negotiations. If they do not first obtain Japan's recognition as an opponent, they will have no way to realize direct negotiations. Thus, it can be said that the future envisioned by the advocate of peace is certainly not better than Peiping and Nanjing, and the content of the arguments for peace is certainly not right either.

### Guilin Wounded Soldiers' Friendship Society Holds General Meeting; Sends Telegram to Wounded Soldiers

### Chinese Tea Sells Well in Foreign Markets; Ministry of Finance Implements Control

(Chongqing) Today, according to official claims, the China National Foreign Trade Commission purchased 800,000 boxes of tea in 1938, and sales to markets in various countries accounted for half of the total. Another 264,000 boxes were shipped overseas to exchange for war and construction materials. The value of China's tea exports in 1938 exceeded 33 million yuan. The Foreign Trade Commission, under the order of the Ministry of Finance, controls all of China's tea and cooperates with the China National Tea Corporation to be responsible for purchasing and exporting in domestic markets. The China National Tea Corporation was established in May 1937 by Chinese bankers and tea merchants, with a capital of 2 million yuan. The Tea Commission had ordered 96,000 boxes of black brick tea and 48,000 boxes of green brick tea to be shipped to the Soviet Union. In addition, it purchased 6,800 boxes of silk tea, 1,500 boxes of black brick tea, and 1,500 boxes of three-sided brick tea to be shipped to the Soviet Union. It is said that the Soviet Union has ordered 200,500 more boxes of brick tea, but the commission was unable to fulfill the order because the war was approaching the brick tea producing areas on the border of Hubei and Hunan.

### Chinese Guerrillas Bomb Changzhou Puppet Police Station; Observations of a Foreigner Residing in Changzhou; Japanese Army Ordered Many Cremation Boxes; Bridges on Highways Near Suzhou Destroyed

The Continental News reported that a certain foreigner residing in Changzhou on the Beijing-Shanghai line told reporters yesterday (the 10th) about the incident last Sunday night when a Chinese guerrilla team surrounded and bombed the Changzhou puppet police station. He was still living in Changzhou City at the time and heard the explosions. According to the foreigner, last Sunday night, the guerrillas sneaked into the key road about a quarter of a mile outside Changzhou City in front of the puppet police station. There were no Japanese soldiers around at the time, as it was late and the Japanese soldiers had all entered the city walls for protection. None of the puppet police were armed, so the guerrillas could do whatever they wanted. They surrounded them, and the guerrilla leader summoned the puppet police and said, "It is pitiful that you work for the Japanese. We will not kill you now, but we warn you that if we meet again, you will not be allowed to escape with your lives." After speaking, they set fire to the police station and bombed it. At 1:45 AM that night, the foreigner personally heard several terrible explosions. At the same time, the countryside between Beijing and Shanghai is becoming increasingly uneasy, especially in the Taihu Lake area. He has observed many signs of this unease. He said that he was deeply impressed by two major changes in the attitude of the Japanese soldiers: one is that the invaders seem to be increasingly violent towards the Chinese people, and the other is that the Japanese army is undoubtedly suffering more casualties and property damage than in the previous one or two months. The Japanese army has ordered many cremation boxes from Chinese carpenters, which is a sure sign that many more Japanese soldiers have been killed. The foreigner spoke with three carpenters who said that Japanese soldiers often came to order cremation boxes. Usually, only Japanese officers are cremated in boxes, so many Japanese soldiers must have been killed. As for the soldiers, they are cremated in piles, and after burning, the ashes are divided into boxes. The boxes used for the cremation of officers are made of thin wooden boards, which are supplied by the Japanese soldiers themselves. Chinese carpenters get eight jiao for each box. The small boxes for holding the ashes are also made of thin boards and cost two jiao each. Currently, many of the bridges on the roads have been partially or completely destroyed, which is another sign that the guerrillas are becoming more active. The foreigner saw five bridges burned and two damaged within eighteen kilometers of Suzhou last week. The road's bus service was suspended for several days. Gunfire can always be heard clearly in Changzhou City. The foreigner also believes that the Japanese troops between Changzhou and Yixing are being harassed severely. The Japanese army has no strong foothold in that mountainous area.

### The Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu Briefly Recaptured Tianchang

Gaoyou Dispatch: Over a hundred Japanese and puppet troops who had been dispatched from Yangzhou to Xishan as reinforcements on May 27th, returned to Yangzhou at 4:00 PM. All the Japanese and puppet troops withdrawn from Xian and Shao were also sent back to their original defenses. Currently, there is no further contact in the Xishan area.

On the 26th, Tianchang was once attacked and briefly recaptured by the Chinese army. Many Japanese and puppet soldiers entrenched in Tianchang were killed by the Chinese forces.

At dawn on the 28th, a certain unit of the Chinese army set off from their defense area in two routes, towards Henan and Hebei, to attack the Japanese army at the Xiannv Temple. The Japanese army immediately responded with artillery fire from the east end of the Xiannv Temple, and indiscriminately fired machine guns. The contact lasted for two hours before stopping. The Japanese side consumed a large amount of ammunition. The Chinese army, having achieved its mission, safely returned to its defenses. The Japanese army, greatly alarmed by this attack, declared martial law around 8:00 AM and dispatched four to five disguised Japanese and puppet soldiers to scout the San Yuan Bridge outside the public road, to probe the movements of the Chinese army.

### Reorganization of the Guangdong Provincial Government's Mobilization Committee; Five Design Committees Established; Wartime Finances Also Perfected

Shaoguan Dispatch: To strengthen the forces of resistance against Japan, the Guangdong Provincial authorities have reorganized and established the Provincial Mobilization Committee, perfecting its internal structure. Provincial Chairman Li Han-hun concurrently serves as the chairman. The committee has already held its first meeting, agreeing that modern warfare relies not solely on military strength, but the total sum of the nation's manpower, financial resources, and material resources. Guangdong Province, known for its wealth, can contribute the greatest strength to the nation if it can mobilize effectively. After careful deliberation, the mobilization plans for the province's manpower, financial resources, and material resources, as well as their sequential steps, have been largely decided. The work of the committee is proceeding with exceptional urgency. The first steps are to mobilize in five areas: culture, people's movement, economy, transportation, and defense. These five are closely related to military affairs and are urgent tasks at present. To ensure separate responsibilities and swift action, five design committees have been established, officially formed, and experts in each field have been hired as design committee members to plan various programs and submit them to relevant agencies for implementation. The selection of committee members and executive directors has also been finalized, and plans are underway to publish small series of books and organize mobilization work teams to strengthen the organizational structure of mobilization committees in various counties. The committee also considers the economy to be of utmost importance during the war of resistance, and therefore attaches great importance to economic mobilization. The Economic Design Committee has decided to widely hire experts to conduct detailed planning and design for the economic mobilization of the entire province. It has also stipulated that future work will be divided into five major areas of research to provide information for the government's relevant agencies to implement: 1. financial and monetary countermeasures; 2. food management; 3. trade and commodity control; 4. rural economic revitalization; 5. production. After all the experts have been hired, detailed implementation rules will be drafted and mobilization will be accelerated.

Corrupt County Magistrates to Be Severely Punished

The Provincial Government recently sent a report from the Provisional Assembly to various assembly members, requesting that those local officials who are unworthy be punished accordingly. It was immediately decided that, in addition to County Magistrate Li Ling-gen of Conghua, who will be dealt with in accordance with the resolution of the Provincial Assembly, former County Magistrate Chen Zhuo-lin of Sanshui and County Magistrate Zhang Hui of Zhongshan will also be prosecuted.

Wartime Finance Extremely Stable

In order to stabilize the wartime financial economy of Guangdong Province, the Provincial Department of Finance has, in accordance with the wartime financial stabilization policy, formulated implementation measures for the province, promulgated them to all counties, and earnestly implemented them. Since its implementation, the finance has been extremely stable. As for the finance of this province, since the outbreak of the war until now, the situation has been unusually stable. It is worth mentioning that: 1. Branch treasuries have been established in most counties, and those that have not been established are actively preparing for them. All county branch treasuries can remit various tax revenues to the county on schedule. However, due to the war, a portion of the collection has been delayed due to environmental factors, and efforts are being made to improve the situation. 2. The promotion of the national currency is being actively promoted. In addition to ordering all counties to strictly prohibit discrimination against the national currency, the department and the provincial bank have also announced to all merchants that all trade must be based on the national currency. All merchants have complied with this order, so the national currency is very popular in the inland counties. 3. The province buys up silver and prevents it from flowing out. After the abolition of silver buying offices in various counties, the task was changed to be handled by the provincial bank branches in each county, and personnel were dispatched to strictly investigate and deal with private smuggling for export. Therefore, the recent amount of silver purchased and remitted by various counties has been quite successful. In addition, measures to prevent the Japanese side from undermining financial policies have also been distributed to all counties for strict implementation. Therefore, the finance of this province is unusually stable. The aspect of finance arrangement can be divided into the following items: 1. Implementation of unified financial management authority for each county, and ordered the organization of a finance committee to assist in the arrangement. Now, the county finance committees have all been established uniformly. 2. Excessive and miscellaneous taxes in various counties have been actively abolished. Provincial and national taxes have also been separately designated. Those belonging to the national treasury are remitted by the county government to the Finance Department, and remitted to the central government in installments. Those belonging to the provincial treasury are remitted by the county tax authorities to the branch treasury, and remitted to the general treasury on schedule. 3. Since the provincial government approved the province's wartime administrative expenses and the expenses of the armed self-defense groups in the guerrilla areas under its jurisdiction, the province's financial revenue and expenditure have been quite suitable. The provincial authorities are still striving to save government expenses and eliminate excessive spending in order to enhance wartime finance.

### Rampant National Socialist Party; Tense German-Polish Relations; New Disputes Arise in Silesia Province; Danzig's Demands Rejected by Poland

Warsaw: Responsible authorities recently announced that a group of National Socialist Party members from Ratiborwitz in German Silesia province broke into the Polish Association of Overseas Residents in Germany last night, destroying furniture, tearing up a photo of former Polish Minister of Military Affairs and General Pilsudski, and taking away various documents. Afterwards, German authorities closed the association and allocated it as the office for the National Socialist Party Youth League. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Warsaw: The Senate of the Free City of Danzig previously sent a note to the Polish government on the 3rd of this month, requesting that the number of Polish customs officials in the city's customs office be reduced, and that all customs officials in office swear allegiance to the city senate. Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, recently sent a Polish reply to the Chairman of the City Senate, Gletzer, rejecting the request, stating that this matter is solely within the jurisdiction of the Polish government and cannot be interfered with by the city senate. Polish rights and interests are guaranteed by the existing agreements between Poland and Danzig, and Poland is determined to protect them. Should the city senate violate existing agreements, such as reducing the number of Polish customs officials or restricting their authority, economic retaliation will be taken. (Note: The appointment and removal of customs officials in the city of Danzig is determined by the Polish government, as stated in the Paris Agreement of November 9, 1920, but the number is not specified.) (Havas dispatch, 10th) The Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, recently rejected the note submitted by the city senate, and this has been fiercely criticized by newspapers here as evidence of Poland's deliberate threat to the city of Danzig. The semi-official German News Agency quoted a comment saying, "Poland is unwilling to settle the Danzig issue peacefully and wants to create incidents by various means, as can be seen from this reply." The local "Guidance Newspaper" stated, "Polish customs officials are all armed and are actually economic spies." (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### New Crisis Brewing in Europe; British Policy Encourages Aggression

(London) British-German relations have recently been commented on by various newspapers. The "Sunday Express" reported that the British Cabinet believes that Germany's expressed wishes can be satisfied by peaceful means, and is planning to convene an international conference to discuss various outstanding issues, including colonial issues, which are often discussed. It is also planning to propose that major powers first limit their armaments in order to create a favorable environment for the success of the conference. However, Germany, based on past experiences, may be emboldened and take tough actions in the Free City of Danzig or elsewhere in response to Britain's peaceful overtures. The British authorities are aware of this and are taking various steps to inform Germany that if there are any further acts of aggression, they are determined to resist by force. Diplomatic circles here believe that the European situation may experience another crisis in the coming weeks. As for what constitutes a crisis, whether it is limited to issuing strong declarations or whether it will involve further actions, will depend on the circumstances. "Picture Weekly" reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain still believes that both Chancellor Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini can be persuaded to participate in an international conference with gentle words and economic benefits, and is prepared to make all sacrifices to maintain peace and plans to use the appeasement policy as a campaign platform in the upcoming general election. However, certain cabinet members are deeply afraid that the appeasement policy means continuing to make concessions to various dictatorships. Prime Minister Chamberlain may listen to Germany's control of Poland, or even make concessions to Germany on colonial issues in order to win over Chancellor Hitler, and therefore strongly oppose it. In addition, the leaders of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force all insisted on dissenting, saying that if Britain makes concessions to Germany on colonial issues, it would be tantamount to suicide from a military perspective.

### Britain and France Plan Joint Proposal; Negotiations on Tripartite Agreement; Differences Not Difficult to Eliminate

(London) Regarding the issue of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, French Ambassador to Britain Corbin met with Foreign Office official Sir Cadogan this morning to propose new suggestions on the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic states. Experts from the British Foreign Office immediately studied them, trying to reconcile the views of Britain and France in order to formulate a joint proposal and hand it over to Mr. Strang, the Director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, to bring to Moscow. The official arena is keeping the content of the French proposal a secret, but it is said to be very simple and clear, advocating that when the interests crucial to the Soviet Union's survival are threatened, the Soviet Union can decide for itself whether it is necessary to implement the mutual assistance agreement. If so, the objections raised by the Soviet Union to the original proposals of Britain and France would no longer be valid. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(London) Mr. Strang, Director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, will travel to Moscow on the 12th of this month to assist Ambassador Seeds in negotiating with the Soviet authorities on the issue of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Various newspapers here believe that Mr. Strang's main task on this trip is to earnestly explain the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic states and earnestly persuade the Soviet authorities to accept the proposals put forward by Britain and France. The "Observer" newspaper reported, "The French government submitted several methods to the British government yesterday that could solve the current difficulties, which will be brought to Moscow by Strang to study with the Soviet government one by one, in order to satisfy the country's wishes while allaying the doubts of the Baltic states. The most promising method is for Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to use the guarantee that Britain provides to Poland as a blueprint to conclude a treaty of alliance in which the three signatory countries mutually guarantee each other's territorial integrity and implement mutual assistance when threatened directly or indirectly. If this method is adopted, the Baltic states can maintain their neutrality in peacetime. If Germany seeks to pass through these countries to attack the Soviet Union, then its interests will be the same as those of the Soviet Union, and there will be a need for joint defense, and there is no need to explicitly mention the names of these countries in the tripartite agreement."

### French Prime Minister Praises Russian Military Achievements; Statue of Joffre Unveiled; Presided Over the Unveiling Ceremony

(Paris) The statue of General Joffre, who commanded the Allied forces in France at the beginning of the European War, was unveiled yesterday by French Prime Minister Daladier in Champoultry. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(Paris) French Prime Minister Daladier gave a speech yesterday at the unveiling ceremony of the monument to the late General Joffre, and expressed great appreciation for the actions of the Russian army during the European War. The French Prime Minister used theoretical methods to prove the necessity of signing a military alliance with the Soviet Union, and praised the assistance of the Russian army at a certain stage of the Great War. He said, "We can still recall that when the Battle of the Marne began, the Russian army restrained the main force of the German army on the plains of East Prussia." His criticism was highly valued because France has historically condemned Russia's "betrayal" at Brest-Litovsk. Daladier's criticism reflects the opinion of the French General Staff, which believes that it is necessary for the Soviet Union to deal with a large number of German troops in the East in the event of a major war.

### Franco-Soviet Cordiality; French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Hosts Banquet for Soviet Dignitaries

### Czech Bohemia and Moravia Provinces; Protection System Coming to an End; Will Be Formally Incorporated into German Territory; Slovak Independence is Just a Name

(Paris) Newspapers here recently reported that Germany's protection system for the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia in the Czech Republic is coming to an end, and they will be directly incorporated into German territory. The "Radical Socialist Party Business Report" stated that the annexation date will be before the 15th of this month, at which time the provinces will become German provinces and be directly administered by the central government of Germany. Czech cultural autonomy will cease from then on. The current Czech courts will no longer exist, and all officials will be replaced by Germans. It is decided that the independent Slovak state will also encounter the same fate. Foreign observers in Berlin have already submitted reports to their respective governments. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Ethnic Hatred; Conflicts Frequently Heard

Prague: Although every effort has been made to prevent conflicts between Czechs and Germans in various parts of the Czech Republic, they still occur frequently and increase the tension between the two ethnic groups. While the incident of the murder of a German police officer in the Klatno area is still under investigation, a fight between Czech and German police officers broke out in Nachod in northern Bohemia yesterday, resulting in the death of one Czech police officer. The German and Czech authorities are now jointly investigating. According to the announcement, this mutual fight is the result of an accumulation of regrettable events. German Protector Neurath has ordered a strict investigation, and all those involved have been arrested. The Czech Prime Minister visited German State Secretary Frank yesterday to express the Czech government's apology for the Klatno incident and stated that the Czech authorities will do their best to apprehend the murderers. As a result of this meeting, the German authorities decided not to temporarily implement the plan announced yesterday to deal with Klatno. Therefore, measures such as fining 500,000 crowns as discussed yesterday, prohibiting night travel from 8:00 PM to 5:00 AM, closing all cinemas, schools, and public places, and closing all doors and windows along the street, will not be implemented for the time being. Neurath has recently issued an announcement stating that in view of the results of the investigation into the attitude of the Czech people and the plans adopted by the Czech Protectorate government, the German Protector will temporarily not implement the special measures that had been planned earlier. The official arena believes that the rumors of hundreds of arrests are not accurate. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

Prague: Regarding the incident of the German policeman being shot and killed, 263 citizens of Klatno have been arrested. Neurath, the German Governor of Bohemia and Moravia, announced that all restrictions and precautions in the area have been lifted. Although the real murderer has not yet been found among those arrested, Neurath believes that the people of the area can maintain order, so there is no need for precautions. Although two German police officers were shot at yesterday, the tense situation has indeed eased. It is said that the German police officers retaliated at the time, but it is not known whether there were any casualties. It is reported that of the 163 people arrested, 110 were Czech police officers, whose crime was dereliction of duty. As for the other arrested people, they are communists and supporters of the former Czech president. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

### Benes Sends Letter to the League of Nations; Protests Germany's Violent Occupation of the Czech Republic; Maisky Speaks Out on Behalf

(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations received a letter from former Czech President Benes yesterday, as well as a report from Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky. Benes's letter, issued on May 13, protested Germany's occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and Hungary's armed invasion of Carpathian Ukraine. Maisky's report stated, "Due to various legal difficulties, Benes's letter was not submitted to the last session of the League of Nations Standing Committee. Now, on behalf of my government, I request all member states to pay attention to the facts stated in Benes's letter." (Haitong dispatch, 11th)

Strauss, whose name is Li Que, was born in Munich on June 11, 1864. He loved music since childhood and was extraordinarily talented. He had already composed excellent music before he reached adulthood, and connoisseurs praised him. After his opera-ballet masterpieces were performed, they became popular far and wide, and he became famous throughout the world. His masterpieces such as "Rosenkavalier," "Ariadne," and "Egyptian Helena" are all staged in major theaters in Europe and America.

### Countries Around the World Compete to Expand Their Air Forces; The United States Should Catch Up; Germany Currently Has the Greatest Strength; Colonel Lindbergh Calls Attention

(Washington) U.S. Air Force Colonel Lindbergh told friends that he believes a European war will not break out immediately. According to those close to Colonel Lindbergh, Lindbergh has been focusing on inspecting and investigating Army aviation affairs since returning to the United States from Europe. Colonel Lindbergh is promoting to influential people in the aviation industry that if the United States does not accelerate its aviation development program, the U.S. Air Force will lag behind Germany by at least five years. Colonel Lindbergh ranks Germany as number one in terms of the number of aircraft. He believes that once the U.S. aviation development program begins, the United States can use mass production methods to surpass Germany in the number of aircraft. As for France, it plans to increase the number of aircraft purchased in the United States to more than 1,200. France has already signed a contract to purchase 800 U.S. aircraft. France originally wanted to buy another 800, but currently can only add less than 500. A French military inspection team, currently led by Quartermaster General Major General Cavert, is traveling around the United States for the purpose of purchasing military supplies. According to unofficial but authoritative Army statistics, France ranks only fifth in the competition to build air forces in Europe. The number of first-line aircraft in the French Army does not exceed 2,200. The strength of the air forces of other European countries is as follows: Germany has 9,500 aircraft, the Soviet Union has 6,100, Italy has 4,800, and Britain has 3,300. Colonel Lindbergh ranks the strength of the European air forces as follows: Germany ranks first, Britain and France together rank second, and Italy ranks third. He said that he is not familiar with the aviation strength of the Soviet Union. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

(Washington) A report by the Foreign Policy Association recently stated that the large-scale manufacture of military aircraft in the United States may not necessarily be due to urgent national defense needs, but the policies of European democracies may be changed as a result. Mr. Popper, a researcher at the association, also stated that it would be a foolish attempt for European and Asian countries to launch an air raid on the Western Hemisphere, as the U.S. air defense capabilities have greatly increased.

### Japanese Ships Use Fishing as a Cover; Spying on U.S. Warship Movements; Considered to Contain Espionage; U.S. Naval Authorities Order Them to Sail Away

San Pedro: Seven Japanese fishing boats at the San Clemente Island naval training base were ordered by the U.S. Navy to leave the island and sail east today. After the U.S. fleet returned from the Atlantic to the Pacific, during the first exercise at sea, it was seen that the Japanese fishing boats were paying special attention to the movements of U.S. warships, so they were forced to return to Japan to fish. The fishing boats had been engaged in shrimping in the Gulf of California for three years. The actions taken by the Navy are part of the work of the U.S. federal government recently conducted on the west coast of the United States for national defense purposes to crack down on foreign espionage activities.

### Axis Powers of Germany and Italy Covet Spain's Rich Resources, Hoping to Obtain Special Political and Economic Benefits as Compensation for Participating in the Spanish Civil War

(London) Germany and Italy are each exerting their efforts, hoping to turn the assistance they provided to General Franco during the Spanish Civil War into special economic and political benefits. Hitler, with this aim in mind, has dispatched his Minister of Economics, Herr Huldtart, to Spain. Simultaneously, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is also in Rome, holding talks with Spanish Interior Minister Suñer. It is said that the purpose of these talks is to arrange the preliminary conclusion of commercial, economic, and political agreements, with the aim of eventually drawing Spain into the Axis. It is expected that Ciano will travel to Madrid at the end of this month to sign such agreements. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday received Suñer and Spanish army personnel at the Palazzo Venezia. Subsequently, Mussolini and Franco exchanged telegrams, declaring eternal friendship between the two countries. Berlin believes that the mission of German Minister of Economics Huldtart is extremely important to German industry. It is said that Huldtart's mission to Madrid is to establish concrete commercial relations with Spain. Germany is most interested in Spain's minerals, especially its iron ore, hoping to obtain concessions from Spain for establishing steel mills and mining iron ore on the spot. (Reuters, 11th)

(Rome) Spanish Interior Minister Suñer has been holding important talks with Italian authorities here for several days. As soon as Foreign Minister Ciano returns from his reciprocal visit to Leão, the two sides will sign a political and economic agreement. The Nationalist government owes Italy a debt amounting to 800 million lira. Italy will naturally seek to participate in the development of Spanish resources as a means of compensation. In addition, Spain will not sign a military agreement with Italy to avoid completely joining the German-Italian Axis, or it is possible that only secondary agreements will be concluded by the general staffs of both sides.

### Copyright Lawsuit over "Mein Kampf": Hitler Wins

(New York) "Mein Kampf," written by German leader Adolf Hitler, was recently translated into English and published by an American publishing company. Several thousand copies have already been sold, and the company has donated the royalties due to the German Government Relief Fund for Exiles. Because the translation was not authorized, Leader Hitler entrusted the Mifflin Publishing Company as its representative to file a lawsuit in this court. The defendant argued that Leader Hitler had lost his Austrian citizenship and could not invoke Austrian copyright. The presiding judge believed that if this precedent were set, all stateless authors would suffer, so he ruled that all unsold copies of the translation should be impounded. (Havas, 10th)

In addition to 58 battalions of the Western University armed forces, there were also 2,000 National Guardsmen. The British King and Queen's car traveled at high speed (45 miles per hour). Later, because the British Queen complained that the car was traveling too fast and they could not see the crowds, Mayor La Guardia ordered the car to slow down to 20 miles per hour. Furthermore, the Roosevelt family had arrived here before the British King and Queen to make all welcome preparations. (Associated Press, 11th)

Four Million People Admired Their Grace

When the New York reached Manhattan Island on the USS Warrington destroyer, the welcome was far greater than that of Colonel Lindbergh's triumphal return to the country in 1927. It is estimated that no fewer than four million people in New York, in 90-degree weather, competed to see the King and Queen, etc. When New York State Governor Lehman introduced the members of the welcoming committee and New York City Mayor La Guardia shook hands with the King, the police band played the American and British anthems, and the 100,000+ onlookers near the docks cheered loudly, paying their respects to the King and Queen, etc. A total of 13 cars were in the motorcade, the King and Queen riding in the first car. 42 police officers rode motorcycles, acting as guides in front of the car. After passing through the never-ending crowds cheering along the 50-mile route, they went directly to the World's Fair. In addition to plainclothes policemen, 15,000 police officers took care of the crowds. One million+ children waved the British and American flags, cheering as if they were one family. The King raised his hand to thank them, and the Queen nodded and smiled in return. When the motorcade arrived at the World's Fair, a 21-gun salute was fired. The Fairgrounds had been crowded with spectators an hour earlier; there had never been such a grand occasion since the opening of the Fair. Police put up security lines everywhere. The King and Queen, etc., entered the elevator to the second-floor reception room to meet with the heads of the various pavilions and members of the city government. After lunch, they briefly visited the Irish and Canadian pavilions, then entered the British pavilion. At the entrance, fireworks were set off, and tens of thousands of British and American flags fell from the sky. Boy Scouts and others picked them up to commemorate the King and Queen's visit. After touring the British pavilion, the King and Queen appeared on the lawn and mingled with the invited guests. The King looked slightly tired, but the Queen showed no signs of fatigue. American, Canadian, and British veterans stood at attention to salute as the King, etc., left the pavilion. The King spoke a few words with one or two white-bearded old soldiers. By this time, the itinerary was already 40 minutes behind schedule. The King, etc., then drove off to Columbia University amid the cheers of the crowd. The president of the university gave a welcoming speech. According to Police Commissioner Valentine's estimate, there were often three million people who saw the motorcade pass by on the road from the Battery on Manhattan Island to the World's Fair. (Reuters, 11th)

The Royal Carriage Enters the World's Fair Venue

King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England arrived in New York this morning on the USS Warrington destroyer from Le Havre, Maryland. The USS Warrington arrived offshore at 11:19 a.m., and the crowds on shore cheered loudly. The British flag was also raised at the same time. A few minutes later, the ship docked, and New York State Governor Lehman, Mayor La Guardia, and British Consul General Haggard here, each with his wife, stepped forward to greet them, presenting the Queen with huge bouquets of flowers and respectfully leading the King and Queen ashore to board specially prepared cars. At this time, the people shouted "Long live" and at 11:30, the motorcade set off, with 75 mounted police officers and 25 police officers on motorcycles escorting them on both sides. However, due to the crowds along the way, the car moved very slowly. People threw colored paper wherever it passed, and large groups of elementary school students waved British and American flags along the road. By the time they arrived at the World's Fair, it was 12:38 p.m., and a 21-gun salute was fired to pay respects. Then, a team of Indians from Kansas led the motorcade into the venue to the grand auditorium, where Fair President Whalen and his wife hosted a reception, introduced key Fair personnel, and met with the King and Queen, along with representatives from various countries. The Italian representative raised his hand in a Fascist salute, which drew criticism from many people in attendance. The motorcade then turned to tour various parts of the venue in light rain. The people cheered enthusiastically wherever they went, and the King and Queen smiled in response. Later, many young Scotsmen, dressed in their traditional attire, played Scottish folk songs to entertain the Queen (who is a Scottish aristocrat). The King and Queen then got out of the car in front of the American pavilion, where no fewer than 100,000 spectators were nearby, and 1,000 American soldiers and sailors lined up to welcome them and were inspected by the King and Queen. The outgoing couple of the American pavilion, the Frys, immediately cordially invited them to a purely American-style lunch. After the meal, the King and Queen went out onto the terrace, where 5,000 children sang the British national anthem. Then, they went to the Canadian pavilion, where they were accompanied by Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King on a tour. They also made brief stops at the South African, Australian, and New Zealand pavilions. Finally, they arrived at the British headquarters pavilion, where Sir Peel, the British representative of the Fair, welcomed them as usual. At 3:50 p.m., they left for Columbia University. The route of the motorcade was mostly through areas inhabited by black people, where they enthusiastically cheered and paid their respects wherever they went. The journey took about three quarters of an hour to reach Columbia University, where 5,000 students lined up at the school gate to welcome them. President Butler personally greeted them and asked the King and Queen to sign their names as a souvenir. It was not until 5:17 p.m. that they changed to a black sedan and drove to Hyde Park in the drizzling rain. At 7:41 p.m., they arrived at President Roosevelt's private residence and were entertained by the President and his wife. (Havas, 11th)

### Scientific Exploration in Dutch New Guinea: Discovery of Stone Age Tribe

Bandung, Java: A year ago, a team of eight Americans, six Dutch, and one Canadian, representing the New York Museum of Natural History, went to Dutch New Guinea for scientific research. The Dutch government sent a troop of soldiers to escort them along the way. They departed from Java to New Hollandia on the northern coast of New Guinea, and then entered the Wilhelmina Mountains and the Idan River area in the interior. They first used a giant plane that could hold more than 20 people to conduct a survey that lasted a whole year before returning here. It is said that they have discovered a large Stone Age tribe, which is the most interesting anthropological discovery. The tribe has 60,000 people, who had never seen white people before the arrival of the expedition. Their utensils are all made of stone, and the language they speak is unintelligible to others. They fight with neighboring tribes, and eating enemies raw is the reward for victory. However, they are quite friendly to explorers and are willing to exchange sweet potatoes and pigs for shells. When they first saw the expedition approaching, they hid in the forest. After gradually becoming familiar with them, they dared to return to the village. They live in round houses and engage in cultivation in their primitive way. The sweet potatoes they produce are enough to meet their needs. The expedition urgently wanted to obtain some stone tools and offered steel and axes in exchange, but they were not interested in them. In the first few weeks, the two sides mostly used gestures to communicate. Before long, the explorers gradually began to understand this strange language. The tribe has not yet been named, but the people of New Guinea all call them the Besqi. This expedition has collected previously unknown species of birds and mammals, and it is said that these specimens may indicate a close relationship between New Guinea and the Australian continent. The American member of the expedition may take a plane back to the United States via Europe. (Reuters, 11th)

### The Impact of Molotov's Speech London Airmail: Small Countries Threatened with Security Sympathize with the Soviet Union; Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Still Awaiting a Suitable Method

— Uncle Di

Molotov's speech was eagerly awaited here. Before its release, the public opinions of Britain and France unanimously declared that the Anglo-French proposal was one that the Soviet Union must accept if it sincerely wished to unite with Britain and France. However, in reality, if you were to discuss it with more insightful observers, they would quietly tell you the "truth": "It would be strange if the Soviet Union accepted it like that!"

Then, on the evening of May 31st, Molotov delivered his speech on Soviet foreign policy in Moscow. The Soviet Union did not accept the Anglo-French proposal, but neither did it reject it. Thus, the British and French authorities were temporarily left with a conundrum. Until the Soviet government's official reply arrived, the British and French authorities were unable to decide on their next step.

In the past two days, the British and French newspapers generally seem to have a rather optimistic impression of this speech. The majority of opinions asserted that the Soviet Union's willingness to unite with Britain and France was undoubtedly a major premise; the current problem was only the conditions and methods. Therefore, in their view, Molotov's speech was merely a tightening of the Soviet Union's diplomatic tactics, aimed at seeking more favorable terms of exchange.

The most noteworthy point in the speech was the emphasis on the Soviet Union's Far Eastern policy and the public declaration of support for China's war of resistance. After Eden's resignation, the collective security system in Europe collapsed. Over the past year or so, the general impression has been that if the European part and the Far Eastern part of the Soviet Union's foreign policy were placed on the two ends of a scale, the Far Eastern part would be heavier. And this Molotov speech is strong evidence of that.

Not long ago, some people said that the Soviet Union today is more accurately described as an Asian power than a European power. Now, after hearing Molotov's speech, the concerns of those who thought that the Soviet Union might relax its firm position in the Far East due to the increasing pressure from Germany and Italy in Europe seem to have been completely dispelled.

As for the negotiations on cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, of course, they will continue. The main reason is that if they were abandoned at this stage, the harm to Britain and France would be unimaginable, much worse than if it had never happened in the first place. Fundamentally, today's European environment dictates that cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must arise at this time. These points have already been made in previous dispatches. What needs to be pointed out now are the two most important events in the European situation during the week or so surrounding Molotov's speech.

The Last Struggle of Chamberlain's Cabinet's Diplomatic Path

British Prime Minister Chamberlain has been in office for nearly three years. Since last year, when British domestic politics have been subject to fluctuations due to diplomacy, news of his intention to retire has been repeatedly reported. However, last week, this news was confirmed: he has decided to retire completely to the countryside next year after the formation of the new government following the general election in November this year, and no longer interfere in politics. However, in the months before his retirement, he still has two things to accomplish: one is how to maintain the Conservative Party's inherent position in the next government, and the other is how to "maintain peace in Europe." In recent days, internal activities and arrangements in Britain have been very tense. Although purely domestic affairs, there is no need to discuss them here; however, there are two points to be pointed out where domestic politics are related to diplomacy: first, those around Chamberlain's inner circle believe that as long as there is another crisis in Europe, another Munich-style conference, then the Conservative Party's position will be very dangerous in the general election; second, the only effective way to prevent a new crisis is undoubtedly a flexible Anglo-French-Soviet "alliance against aggression." The focus of these two points is still on domestic politics, with diplomacy being merely a means. This is also considered one of the reasons why people in Britain who have always opposed being close to the Soviet Union have suddenly changed their attitudes in this Anglo-French-Soviet cooperation negotiation. However, the purpose of the "Chamberlain Cabinet" is not limited to this. It also has its own diplomatic path.

What is the "Chamberlain Cabinet's" diplomatic path? The first step is to completely resolve the contradictions between Britain and France and Germany and Italy. The second step is to sign a "Four-Power Pact." The third step is to reorganize the League of Nations, kick out the Soviet Union, or even create an anti-communist army. The various dreams of this path, even in Britain, have long been ridiculed or even forgotten. However, on the eve of Chamberlain's departure, as a last gasp, he still wants to make a final attempt.

Therefore, according to the recent plans of Chamberlain's close confidants, if the Soviet Union had accepted the Anglo-French proposal this week, then what would have followed immediately would not have been concrete sanctions against aggression, but rather the start of "adjusting diplomatic relations" with Germany and Italy.

As for the method of "adjustment," according to the current plans of these people, it would probably be based on Britain, France, and the Soviet Union (with the necessary addition of the United States) as the main initiators, inviting Germany and Italy to hold an international conference to engage in various discussions, preceded by contacts between Britain and Germany.

Naturally, this planned "contact," if successful, could at any time change direction again, leading to the path of the "Four-Power Pact," and returning to the old path of the "Chamberlain Cabinet." Because, according to Chamberlain's idea, in this "contact," Britain must tell Germany, and make her believe, that Britain has absolutely no intention of "attacking" her, and that everything is for "defense"; in other words, as long as Germany and Italy do not hinder the main interests of Britain and France, everything can still be discussed to satisfy Germany and Italy's "desires." From this, it can be inferred that not only can the results of past aggression be recognized, but even the survival of some other small countries can also be within the scope of discussion.

The intention of this Molotov speech, which re-emphasized collective security and upheld Stalin's principle of aiding all countries fighting for their independence, was to address this point. In the eyes of all small countries in Europe whose security is threatened, the reputation and credibility of the Soviet Union, compared to those of Britain and France, are becoming the opposite, rising and falling.

German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's New Plan

Since the Munich Conference last year, Ribbentrop's reputation in Germany has been very high: his assessment of the British situation was even more accurate than Hitler himself! Hitler believed that he surpassed everyone in all aspects, but he was still hesitant about demanding the cession of the Sudetenland because he was worried about offending Britain. However, from the beginning, Ribbentrop advised him not to be afraid to go further and simply demand the cession, because Britain would never go to war for this, and on the contrary, would be afraid of the outbreak of war and act as a mediator to give it to Germany. Hearing this, Hitler was hesitating; however, within a few days, an editorial appeared in The Times, representing the British government, openly advocating the cession of the Sudetenland. After that, Hitler would ask this "expert on Britain" about events involving Britain. Therefore, Hitler dared to brazenly occupy Czechoslovakia in March this year because Ribbentrop had completely calculated the possible reaction of Britain in advance. After several such incidents, his position in Germany today is second only to Hitler and Göring, making him the third most important person.

Such an important figure, while Hitler is temporarily silent due to the uncertain outcome of the Anglo-French-Soviet cooperation negotiations, has drafted a future expansion plan for him.

The specific content of this new plan put forward by Ribbentrop is still unknown. However, its general gist, based on what is already known, can be divided into two parts. The most important is the part about the basis of the argument, which probably has three points: Any large-scale German expansion plan must be put forward when the current British cabinet is in power, while Chamberlain, its "peace envoy," has not yet stepped down; Future actions do not necessarily involve mobilizing troops and generals; All preparations must be completed before the Nuremberg Nazi Party Congress in September. As for the specific plan, it is still limited to Southeastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Near East, and does not include Ukraine in the Soviet Union.

Now Molotov's speech has been delivered. Once the Soviet government's official reply arrives in the next few days, Britain and France will probably take further action. It seems that the fundamental abandonment of the negotiations is unlikely; the problem is the method of future negotiations and the determination of Britain and France to sanction aggression. Determination is the fundamental problem, and Britain and France must make a big decision, but even if they have determination, it will still not work without a suitable method of negotiation. In the current situation, there is still a considerable distance between the Soviet Union and Britain and France in terms of determination; and given the lack of trust between the current governments of Britain and the Soviet Union, what method can be used to satisfactorily achieve the task of understanding? This is also a considerable obstacle to the current Anglo-Soviet negotiations. At present, some people in Britain have also noticed this problem and are discussing remedies. There are probably two new methods that are most generally supported: first, to achieve a satisfactory understanding through a third country, such as Turkey; second, more direct private contact between British and French authorities and Soviet authorities. With this as the goal, even the matter of Halifax and Bonnets seeking an opportunity to negotiate with Potemkin is now being discussed by everyone. However, all these plans are not yet mature, and other new methods are also constantly being proposed, so it is not yet time to draw conclusions.

### Overview of Vocational Education in China (4): Promulgation of Regulations for Midwifery Nurse Schools; Compilation and Review of Teaching Materials for Various Subjects in Vocational Schools

Achievements Exhibition

In order to examine the performance of vocational schools nationwide and to provide opportunities for mutual observation and improvement among the schools, the Ministry of Education held an exhibition of achievements of vocational schools and labor courses in primary and secondary schools in the capital in December of the 23rd year. The scope of solicited exhibits was divided into two categories, A and B. Category A was the main exhibits, including students' practical achievements, working drawings, and students' achievements and working drawings from labor courses in primary and secondary schools. Category B was the supplementary exhibits, including achievements of educational administrative organs, school achievements, and teaching achievements. A total of 1,513 schools from 30 provinces and cities participated in this exhibition. The types of schools exhibiting included 169 vocational schools, 337 middle schools, 139 normal schools, and 868 primary schools. The types of exhibits totaled 43 categories, with a total of 30,955 items. The Ministry invited experts to serve as judges, who believed that the overall achievements showed progress. The points that should be improved in the future have been communicated to the provinces and cities for them to follow and improve.

In December of the 23rd year, the Ministry of Education took the opportunity of holding the exhibition of achievements of vocational schools and labor courses in primary and secondary schools nationwide to convene vocational education personnel in charge of educational administrative organs in various provinces and cities, and also wrote to the National Economic Council, the Construction Committee, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Communications, and the National Academic Work Advisory Office, inviting them to send representatives to hold a national vocational education discussion meeting. Representatives from various ministries and commissions and provinces and cities raised issues based on the actual situation of vocational education and discussed them together to seek solutions. At the same time, the Ministry invited domestic experts with rich experience in vocational education to give lectures on various issues of vocational guidance. A total of 52 proposals were submitted by the provinces and cities, and 14 essential cases were resolved, all of which were the most important matters in vocational education administration. The Ministry of Education separately organized and selectively implemented them.

Consolidating Medical Education

Midwifery and nursing schools are related to the health of mothers and the general public. Previously, there were few dedicated schools. By the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education investigated privately established midwifery schools, of which there were more than 100. It then joined with the Ministry of Interior to form a midwifery education committee, responsible for planning and drafting temporary standards for the school system and curriculum of midwifery schools. By the 24th year of the Republic of China, there were a total of 367 midwifery and nursing schools in various places. Experts were hired to formulate and promulgate curriculum standards for the two types of schools, and two types of provisional regulations for senior midwifery and nursing vocational schools were promulgated, stipulating the level of students and the length of study. At the same time, a specialized committee on midwifery and nursing education was organized to plan everything, supervise and promote.

In the 25th year, in order to unify the graduation level of midwifery and nursing schools, the regulations for the screening examination and graduation examination of midwifery and nursing schools were specially announced, but they were temporarily suspended due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance.

### Public Concession Notifies Schools to Reduce Vaccination to Once

The Health Department of the Public Concession Bureau, in order to prevent epidemics during the summer season, has publicly administered vaccinations. It has paid close attention to schools and has assigned specialists to be in charge. In previous years, it was customary for the department to give two vaccinations to each school. This year, due to the increase in the number of schools in the concession and the fact that the number of students has exceeded previous years by five or six times, the prepared vaccine is insufficient, so it has been decided to reduce the number of vaccinations per school to one. The Health Department has notified the schools in conjunction with the Education Department.

Famous athletes such as Guan Youwen, Bi Si, Zhang Liang, and Ling Xuewen were absent, which reduced the excitement considerably. After the start, cars were dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department to lead the way, and the crowds of spectators along the route numbered over ten thousand, a scene of unprecedented splendor.

Start

At 6:30, participants gathered at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road for the start. Hua Xu gave the starting signal, and with the sound of a silver whistle, Wang Zhenglin, with his experienced skill, broke out first. Liu Guangfa, Huang Jinfu, Lin Guoyou, and Geli Mengsi followed closely behind. Ma Riji, Zhou Ruquan, and Wan Jinsheng lagged behind by ten meters. After running Jing'an Temple Road and turning into Yuyuan Road, Wang Zhenglin led from afar. Liu Guangfa suddenly accelerated at this time, darting through the crowd and gradually closing in on Wang Zhenglin. Wang Jinfu and Lin Guoyou remained in the middle of the pack, trailing by thirty meters. Wan Jinsheng and Geli Mengsi were another fifty meters behind. By the time they reached Zhaofeng Garden, the rankings remained the same.

Midway

On Triumph Road, Wang Zhenglin had already left Liu Guangfa forty meters behind. At this time, Huang Jinfu, Li Duan, Ma Riji, and Lin Guoyou were neck and neck. After passing Dunxin Road, Wang and Liu maintained their original positions. Upon reaching Daxilu, two-fifths of the entire journey had been completed. The racers were invigorated at this point. Wang Zhenglin still left Liu Guangfa forty meters behind, while Huang and Lin advanced shoulder to shoulder. Li was another forty meters behind, while Geli Mengsi and Wan Jinsheng competed fiercely. After traversing Difeng Road, crossing Jing'an Temple Road, and returning to Yuyuan Road, then Triumph Road, and Dunxin Road, the order of ranking remained the same as before.

Finish

Turning from Daxilu into Yidingpan Road, the finish line was just 0.5 miles away. On Haig Road, the rankings remained the same. By the time Haig Road turned into Fuxu Road, the final order was largely determined. Wang Zhenglin calmly and steadily maintained his lead throughout. Liu Guangfa lagged behind by thirty meters. In front of Guangxia Middle School on Moore Road, Wang bravely surged forward. Liu Guangfa, Huang Jinfu, Lin Guoyou, Li Duan, Ma Riji, and Geli Mengsi were within three to four meters of each other. Turning onto Jing'an Temple Road, the finish line was in sight. Wang Zhenglin accelerated, dashing straight to Baker Road, and turning into Chengdu Road. At this time, over four thousand spectators stood on the roadside, applauding and cheering. Upon entering the athletic field of the Private Shanghai Middle School, he reached the finish line first with a time of 1 hour, 6 minutes, 34 seconds, winning the championship. Liu Guangfa, lagging behind by thirty meters, won second place. Huang Jinfu, another seventy meters behind Liu, came in third. Awards were presented after the race.

### Unable to Resume Work Due to Poor Environment: The Appeal of the Lunchang Workers: Sincere Words of Suffering Hunger to Preserve Reputation and Unwillingness to be Exploited: Hope for Relief from All Sectors

The Lunchang Textile Factory's decision to resume work was interfered with unexpectedly, resulting in an unfortunate incident in which the British employee, Ding Geqin, was killed. This matter has aroused concern from all parties. After investigation, the details of the incident at the factory are recorded as follows:

The Process of Resuming Work at Lunchang After the War

The Lunchang Textile Factory's old factory in Bailianjing has been in operation for sixteen or seventeen years. During the August 13th Incident, the factory was unable to continue working due to the war, and it was temporarily declared closed. The workers were also dismissed and returned to their hometowns. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, when the war shifted westward, the factory announced in September that it was preparing to resume work. Because the workers were scattered, it was not until February or March of the 27th year that workers gradually came to the factory to resume work. Due to the impact of the war, the factory reduced the original bonus of 15 yuan per thousand pieces, regardless of whether they were multicolored or not, and gradually sought to restore it.

Labor-Capital Coordination Resolves Disputes

Recently, prices of all goods have been expensive, and workers' lives have become more difficult. The workers of the factory loved the factory and were very enthusiastic. The factory also cared about the workers. The workers requested the factory to increase the bonus to subsidize rice. The labor and capital sides, based on the spirit of mutual assistance, negotiated for three weeks. The factory agreed to increase the rice subsidy by three tenths and the bonus by five percent. The workers believed that the factory's response was satisfactory and decided to continue working immediately.

Unexpected Obstruction Prevents Resumption of Work

Unexpectedly, after the plan had been agreed upon, when the workers went to the factory to resume work, members of the South Wharf puppet self-defense corps, instigated by others, came out to interfere and prevented the workers from going to work. As a result, the factory was surrounded by puppet troops, and the workers could not go to work. At that time, two workers were injured by the puppet corps members. Until now, the workers preparing to work at the factory are still being prevented, and they have been exposed to the elements and have experienced hardship. However, the workers of the factory are determined and will not be exploited by others. They have also sent letters to all sectors, appealing for relief.

Workers' Letter Describes Suffering

To the Editor of Shenbao: We are writing because the previous report in your newspaper about the resumption of work at the old Lunchang factory failed to clarify all the circumstances of the strike. Therefore, we workers are now reporting all the circumstances to all sectors of society to clarify the truth. Our factory has been in operation for sixteen or seventeen years. In terms of printing alone, we cannot describe all the details. Originally, the bonus was calculated at 15 yuan per thousand pieces, regardless of whether they were multicolored or not. Until August 13th, our country was invaded,

The War Broke Out

The factory was unable to start work, work was stopped, and the workers were dispersed to their hometowns to avoid the disaster, suffering unspeakable hardships. It was not until the 26th year of the Republic of China that the war in Shanghai shifted westward, and the Pudong area was slightly calmer. In September of that year, the factory, seeing this, immediately published a notice to recruit workers from all departments in preparation for starting work. At that time, because the workers were scattered in various hometowns to escape the disaster, the factory could not start work in full. It was not until February or March of the 27th year that workers living nearby came to the factory to resume work. At this time, the factory

Reduced the Bonus

Calculated by multicolored or less colored, the multicolored was reduced to 10 yuan and 5 cents per thousand pieces, and the less colored was reduced to 5 yuan and 25 cents. According to this calculation, it has been reduced by more than half. During the War of Resistance, people from all over came to Shanghai to make a living. There was no way to maintain life, so they had to bear it painfully. However, because they could not maintain life, they had to ask the factory to increase the bonus to subsidize rice. After three weeks of negotiations, the factory finally agreed to

Increase Rice Subsidy

by three tenths, and the bonus was increased by five percent. The workers thought that the reply was satisfactory and allowed to resume work. Unexpectedly, on the day of resumption of work, members of the South Wharf puppet self-defense corps, instigated by a certain party, came out to interfere and prevented the workers from going to work. There were also Japanese soldiers protecting the scene, but it was still ineffective. As a result, every morning at five or six o'clock, the factory was surrounded by puppet troops, oppressing the workers and preventing them from going to work. Two workers were injured, and there were various kinds of intrusions into the factory. The workers were

Unarmed

The factory also had no way to guarantee their safety, so the workers had to leave the factory, enduring the pain of darkness and starvation. We earnestly request charitable people from all walks of life to have great compassion and find ways to relieve the lives of hundreds of workers, which is better than building a seven-story pagoda. The workers will be reborn and will do their best. The workers would rather endure the suffering of hunger than accept the money from selling themselves and shouting, in order to preserve the reputation of our Chinese nation. The above points are all facts. Sincerely requested by all the workers of the old Lunchang factory in Bailianjing,

### Japanese Embassy Counselor Morishima Returns to Shanghai

Morishima, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy, left Shanghai to return to Japan a week ago to report to his government. It is learned that Morishima, having completed his mission, returned to Shanghai from Japan yesterday in a hurry.

### Ferry Services Suspended in South Pudong

The situation in South Pudong has been quite unsettling for several days. It is rumored that Japanese troops are searching at various ferry crossings. The ferries at Bailianjing and Liuliqiao have been suspended since yesterday.

### Britain Protests to Japan: Contents of the Note: The Requested Contents are Divided into Six Items, Requesting the Japanese Authorities to Pay Attention

The Mainland News reports that yesterday (the 10th), it was learned that the British Consul-General, Mr. Phelips, formally sent a note to the Japanese Consul-General, Mr. Miura, on Friday, confirming the oral negotiations made by Mr. Phelips on Wednesday. The note stated that there were several teams of armed plainclothes Japanese near the Lunchang Printing Factory in Bailianjing, Pudong, who were intimidating Chinese workers who hoped to resume work after the strike was resolved, and who shot at two British employees of Lunchang who were leaving the factory to encourage workers to return to the factory, forcing the printing factory to temporarily close. The

Written Protest

Requests: A. To restrain armed agitators from operating near the printing factory. B. Japanese soldiers should fully protect the British employees still residing in the printing factory and the Lujiazui Textile Factory. C. To restrain agitators near the Lujiazui Textile Factory. D. To restrain the current widespread anti-British agitation and propaganda. E. To prevent anti-British parades in Pudong and the posting of large anti-British banners, as well as the distribution of

Similar Nature

Printed materials. F. To restrain the "Great People's Assembly" and other anti-British groups. What is of particular interest is that the note for the first time cited the anti-British agitation in the Xin Shenbao, which is under Japanese control, and formally asked the Japanese authorities to pay attention. The note mentioned an article published in the Xin Shenbao last Wednesday and accused the article of actually inciting damage to British interests. The British Consulate-General considered it

Particularly Unfortunate

that the article was published the day after the Ding Geqin tragedy. The British authorities have made efforts to restrain the anti-Japanese propaganda in the Chinese newspapers of British merchants in this area, and asked Mr. Sanpu to take similar actions with regard to Xin Shenbao. According to the article published in the Xin Shenbao, it said that the British came to China with the ambition of robbers and that they aimed to extract wages to

And it also said that the strike at the Lunchang Textile Factory could not be resolved, and compromise meant complete destruction. It called on the workers to follow the spirit of the Guangzhou workers who overthrew British imperialism in China on January 27th.

### Affected by Foreign Exchange Contraction: Various Industries Raise Prices: The Impact on Social Life is Far from Superficial

Since the drastic changes in foreign exchange rates, the prices of foreign goods imported into China have been increasing. Due to cost reasons, many industries have raised prices. Yesterday, the taxi industry, the leather industry, and the screw industry all announced price increases. The details are listed below:

Taxi Companies Increase Fares

The Shanghai Taxi Industry Association announced an increase in fares, stating: "Due to the sudden contraction of foreign exchange, the prices of gasoline and tire parts have soared. It is difficult for our members to support this. Therefore, from 00:00 on June 12 (i.e., after 12:00 on the night of the 11th), taxi fares will be increased. The minimum charge will be one yuan and forty cents in national currency every twenty minutes, and four yuan and twenty cents per hour, in order to supplement costs. However, the increased amount is still insufficient to maintain costs. Therefore, this notice is hereby published to inform all sectors of society, and we hope for your understanding."

Leather Industry Announces Price Increase

The Leather Industry Association announced: "Due to the drastic changes in foreign exchange rates, raw material prices have soared, and the source of raw hides is scarce. If we do not urgently increase prices, it will be difficult to maintain costs. It has now been jointly discussed by the industry that, starting from today, heavy-duty bottom leather will be priced at 1.85 yuan per kilogram in legal currency, and medium and light-duty bottom leather will be priced at 1.80 yuan per kilogram in legal currency. In order to inform all, this notice is hereby issued, and we hope for your understanding."

Screw Prices Increased by 25%

The Republic of China Screw Company announced: "Recently, due to the sudden tightening of exchange rates, raw materials have become extremely expensive. The wholesale prices of the Tapa Brand screws produced by our factory will be increased by 25% (i.e., 25 percent) from today, according to the price list. This is unavoidable, and we hope for your understanding." In addition, the hardware industry and the hardware parts industry have also decided to increase prices, with hardware increasing by 30% and parts increasing by 20%. In addition, foreign paper, kerosene, pigments, wool, piece goods, tobacco, coal, sugar, and other industries have also increased prices one after another, but not uniformly.

Wireless Materials Also Increased

The vacuum tubes and various parts for installing radios sold in the city's wireless materials stores, except for a few that are manufactured by the factory itself, are mostly shipped from the United States and the Netherlands. Recently, due to the sudden changes in foreign exchange rates, costs have increased. The industry has had to increase the selling price. Therefore, the selling prices of these vacuum tubes and parts have been increased by two to three cents each, in order to maintain costs.

### Wife of French Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai from Paris, with Two Daughters

After the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Gosmart, left Shanghai for Chongqing, his wife and two children arrived in Shanghai on the 10th on the postal ship Ashah from Paris, France. After arriving in Shanghai, the Ambassador's wife immediately changed to a car and returned to the Ambassador's residence to rest. The Ambassador's eldest daughter, Alice, is eighteen years old this year, and the younger daughter, Saiyas, is only six years old this year.

### Japanese Arrest Chinese Again South of Suzhou Creek, Only Notifying the Police Department Upon Release: Detained for Interrogation in a Heroin Case

The Mainland News reports that two plainclothes Japanese, without notifying the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, again arrested a Chinese person outside Nanjing Road on the south bank of Suzhou Creek yesterday morning (the 10th). It was only when they decided to release the arrested Chinese person that they notified the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities. The arrested person was a Chinese broker, Chen Fengshan (transliteration). As soon as he got out of his car, two plainclothes Japanese men arrived and dragged him into their car, driving across the Waibaidu Bridge and into Hongkou. Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese took the broker to the Central Police Station and handed him over to the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities. The Japanese told the police that they had arrested him because they wanted to question Chen about the sale of heroin. The Japanese suspected him of engaging in heroin trading, but the suspicion had been proven unfounded, so they decided to hand him over to the Shanghai Municipal Council police. Chen was then released by the Police Department.

### After the Foreign Exchange Market Price Adjustment: Hope for a Sharp Increase in Domestic Goods Exports: Southwest Customs' Successful Management Turns into Export Surplus: Shanghai and Tianjin Customs' Import Surplus May be Reduced Thereafter

After the Chinese government adjusted foreign exchange market prices, the foreign exchange in the Shanghai market was tightened, but this was beneficial to China's international balance of payments, reducing the import of useless foreign goods, eliminating import surpluses, and encouraging exports. However, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee decided to do everything possible to maintain the stability of foreign exchange rates. The details are as follows:

After Southwest Customs' Export Surplus and the Shanghai Customs' Efforts to Eliminate Import Surplus, the men's customs of Mengzi, Simao, Tengyue, Longzhou, Beihai, Qiongzhou, Leizhou, Jiangmen, as well as Wenzhou and Shantou in the Southwest have now become export-surplus customs. However, the customs in the occupied areas are still in import surplus, and the numbers are increasing. The largest are Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiaozhou, Yantai, Qinhuangdao, and Xiamen. For example, from January to April this year, Tianjin's import surplus was 74.3007 million yuan, Shanghai's import surplus was 72.316 million yuan, Jiaozhou's import surplus was 14.9511 million yuan, and Yantai's import surplus was 5.09 million yuan.

The April Import Surplus Set a New Record. Regarding the country's foreign trade, at the beginning of the war, from September to December 1937, the monthly import surpluses were changed to export surpluses. The total export surplus for those four months was 53.627 million yuan. From June to September 1938, each month was also an export surplus, with a total export surplus of 20.638 million yuan for those four months. However, from October last year to April this year, there have been import surpluses, totaling 156.242 million yuan. The highest new record for the import surplus since the war was created in April of this year, amounting to 56.541 million yuan.

The Value of Imported Foreign Goods is Alarming. Taking the imports of foreign goods from January to April this year as an example, the first was miscellaneous grains and flours, valued at 59.196 million yuan. The second was candles, soaps, oils, fats, waxes, glues, and rosin, valued at 42.146 million yuan. The third was cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton thread, valued at 40.39 million yuan. The fourth was miscellaneous goods, valued at 22.413 million yuan. The fifth was gold ore and metal sand, valued at 20.658 million yuan. Compared with the same period last year, except for a decrease in miscellaneous goods, metals, and ores, the item of cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton thread increased by 37.427 million yuan.

Adjusting Foreign Exchange to Encourage Exports. Since the Chinese government adjusted foreign exchange market prices and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation restricted the supply of foreign exchange in the black market, the foreign exchange in Shanghai's black market has tightened, which will reduce the import of useless foreign goods, and the import surpluses of Shanghai and Tianjin Customs will naturally be eliminated. The export of China's main domestic goods can be increased. The government, in addition to striving to increase the production of tung oil, medicinal materials, mineral sands, silk, and cotton, has also designated the Trade Commission to be responsible for control and centralized export to Hong Kong and other places. The export of domestic goods that are settled in foreign exchange is exempt from export taxes and transit taxes, and the Central Trust Bureau provides insurance for various risks.

The Stabilization Committee is Responsible for Maintaining Foreign Exchange. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will continue to do everything possible to maintain the foreign exchange in Shanghai's black market, ensuring that prices reach a horizontal line. At the same time, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is working closely with the committee to jointly stabilize the exchange rate in Shanghai's black market. Foreign exchange will still be supplied as much as possible to importers who have legitimate needs. Other banks, such as Maisley, Citibank, etc., are also taking the same action. Therefore, the exchange rate in Shanghai's black market has stabilized and will not shrink again, and the legal foreign exchange price of the Central Bank remains the same and unchanged.

### Little Foreign Exchange Trading; Slight Activity Expected This Morning; Gasoline Prices Slightly Increased; Foreign Newspapers and Magazines Also Increase Prices

Mainland newspapers report that the Shanghai exchange market was not very active yesterday (the 10th) morning, but the closing at noon was quite stable. At that time, HSBC, according to the British exchange rate of six pence five three one two five, began to sell foreign exchange to local banks. This exchange rate is higher than the six pence five three one two five maintained by various managing banks until a few minutes before closing on Saturday and Sunday. This is the effort of our Sino-British Equalization Fund to

stabilize the market. Last night, local bankers and brokers were also unclear about this point, and could not obtain news from the managing banks in Shanghai. Therefore, the public and the local financial community will have to wait until Monday to see the changes after that. There was little foreign exchange trading yesterday morning. Some activity is certainly inevitable. The managing banks sold foreign exchange at six pence five until near the noon closing. Various banks continued to

sell small amounts of British pounds and US dollars to customers. Although there were unfulfilled orders from the Japanese side, there were no large transactions in the brokerage community. Yesterday, many importers and merchants increased the prices of goods, causing the cost of living in Shanghai to continue to rise. Personnel from major oil companies in the city stated on Friday that they currently do not intend to raise prices, but gasoline has already increased from one yuan four jiao per gallon to one yuan five jiao. Since the exchange rate began to plummet, the value of imported

magazines and newspapers has increased by 35% to 50%. Also, according to Yilu yesterday, according to the existing land regulations, the Public Works Department has the right to take actions it deems appropriate in an emergency to "maintain peace and order," so the bureau has the right to control food prices. Last night, it was heard from reliable sources that the current price surge is not considered an emergency by the Public Works Department.

### Xinghua and Quanzhou Shipping Suspended; Quietly Awaiting British Government Negotiations; Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Lundon and Keeler Companies Have All Temporarily Suspended Sending Ships to Xingquan Ports

Since the Japanese naval authorities obstructed third-country ships from sailing to the nine ports of Neigang Haimen Qidong Quanzhou Xinghua, etc., except for the Haimen Qidong on the Beisha Line, where the ships changed the place names to clear customs and barely sailed, the Xinghua Quanzhou route was forced to suspend shipping. British companies Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Yilung, and Keeler have all temporarily suspended sending ships to sail. They are now quietly awaiting negotiations between the British government and Japan.

### Thrift Movement Committee Earnestly Urges Citizens Not to Enter Gambling Dens, Providing Limited Money for Unreasonable Extortion is No Different from Moths Flying into a Fire and Throwing Themselves into a Net

The Thrift Movement Committee of this city, previously because the gambling dens in West Shanghai harmed society, had issued a notice to all citizens, not to be bewitched by them. Now, considering that the gambling trend is more rampant than before, and the harm is unknown, yesterday it issued another letter to the citizens, giving earnest advice, with earnest words and a long heart, and it is urgently recorded as follows: Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the road sections beyond the boundary in West Shanghai, under the protection of the Japanese puppets, have been full of gambling dens, and the gambling trend is rampant. Shaking stalls and roulette are everywhere. It is beautifully named "Some Club", but in fact it is

a place to hide dirt, accommodate filth, commit adultery and commit crimes. Everything from prostitutes to drugs is available. The people in charge are mostly local ruffians, who use the protection of dark forces to implement their poisonous methods of sucking cream, sucking blood, and killing people without using knives. The harm to society is actually greater than floods and beasts. Recently, it has become even more intensified, and has conceived ingenious ideas, actually borrowing names, publishing advertisements, and luring citizens into it. However, some people who do not know how to love themselves have obliterated their conscience, been blinded by interests, and do not hesitate to fly moths into the fire,

throwing themselves into the net, calling Lu and drinking pheasant, enjoying it tirelessly, providing limited money for unlimited extortion, and even embezzling public funds, making all kinds of arrangements, indulging in momentary excitement, making a desperate bet, and eventually ruining their reputation and reaching the end of the road, or regretting it too late, and developing shortsightedness. All these facts have been published in newspapers, and they are often seen. Thinking of this, how can we not sigh? Looking back at those invaders, they are very strict with the overseas Chinese in Shanghai. Even those who gamble with slot machines must be severely punished. The Chinese people feel guilty about this, and can they not be aware and deeply repent? In particular, during extraordinary times, we are working hard on thrift, how can we recklessly engage in extravagant gambling, causing

the already thin to become fat and only satisfy the enemy? This association thinks it is dangerous and inconvenient to remain silent, so it dares to reveal its sincerity again and earnestly urge all citizens of the city, if they are trapped in gambling dens, they should extricate themselves from it as soon as possible, and not continue to be obsessed and go deep into the wrong path. Those who have not entered gambling dens should maintain purity, never go there, and hope that fathers will advise their sons, brothers will warn their younger brothers, teachers will monitor their students, and shop owners will be strict with their partners, and friends should also supervise each other and encourage each other, so that the treacherous people will have nowhere to use their tricks, which will not only be the blessing of society, but also the benefit of the country.

### Amidst Foreign Exchange Tightening, Rice Prices Rise Again; No. 1 White Rice Breaks 18 Yuan Mark; Fortunately, There is Sufficient Stockpile, and There is No Worry About People's Food

Since various rice industry groups have tried their best to dredge the sources and the concession authorities have cracked down on speculation and manipulation, the market rice price has begun to fall back and stabilize. Now, due to the tightening of the black market foreign exchange and the increase in the cost of foreign rice, at the same time, there are rumors of prohibition of export in various places such as Kunshan, coupled with the rare arrival of goods in recent days, the market rice price has risen again. No. 1 white rice has broken the 18 yuan mark, and the price of other types of rice has exceeded 17 yuan. Speculators in the market deliberately release them, attempting to manipulate them. Rice prices have become serious. Fortunately, the existing stockpile is sufficient. Although prices have risen, there is no worry about people's food.

### Public Works Department May Report

During the past month, the Public Works Department filed a total of 12,174 public prosecutions in the First Special District Court and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, including 10,453 administrative cases and 1,72 criminal cases. In the administrative cases, 6,922 defendants did not appear in court, and all their bail deposits were confiscated. Sixteen administrative cases were withdrawn, and 3,515 cases were concluded. 3,515 defendants were punished. 115 criminal cases were withdrawn, and 1,606 cases were concluded. 1,465 defendants were convicted, and 141 were acquitted. In addition, there were 146 criminal private prosecution cases. The Public Works Department did not file any appeals last month. A total of six appeal cases were concluded. As of the end of May, there were a total of three appeal cases filed by the Public Works Department that were pending trial (two in the Supreme Court and one in the Higher Court). There were a total of 107 appeal cases filed by the defendants (eleven in the Supreme Court and ninety-eight in the Higher Court). Twelve appeal cases filed by the defendants were concluded, including six cases where the defendants were acquitted, eighty-six cases where the appeals were dismissed, three cases where the appeals were withdrawn, four cases where the penalties were increased, and eleven cases where the penalties were reduced. There were a total of 217 appeal cases filed by the defendants that were pending trial (sixty-four in the Supreme Court and one hundred and fifty-three in the Higher Court).

### People's Self-Defense Army Attacks Hongqiao Airport; Tax Collection Agency Also Attacked; Traffic Once Cut Off

Since the Jiangzhe People's Self-Defense Army arrived and scattered in Qibao Sijing area of West Shanghai last month, they immediately destroyed the highway bridges to block the traffic of the Japanese puppet army and launched attacks from time to time. Therefore, the Japanese puppet army in that area was extremely panicked. According to people from that area, on the evening of the 7th of this month, Commander Wang of the First Detachment of the Self-Defense Army personally led Xue's Second Battalion to attack the Japanese puppet army stationed at Hongqiao Airport and the puppet tax collection agency. The Japanese puppet army fought in a hurry and was in a state of panic. After half an hour, they collapsed and fled to West Shanghai. It is said that more than 20 Japanese puppet soldiers were killed or injured in this battle, and the Self-Defense Army suffered 8 or 9 casualties. More than a dozen long and short guns were seized, as well as a lot of canned food. The army returned to its original defense, and traffic to Shanghai was once cut off at that time.

### Notice from the Chinese Consul-General in the Philippines; Measures for Refugees to Enter the Philippines; Ships Sailing from Shanghai and Hong Kong to the Philippines Can Carry Refugees; Holders of "Manchukuo" Passports, Etc. Are Refused Landing

The Philippine government has reached an agreement with the Chinese Consul-General in the Philippines regarding the measures for Chinese war zone refugees to enter the Philippines, stipulating that ships sailing from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fujian can carry 100 refugees per ship. However, those holding passports from "Manchukuo" and the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" requesting to enter the Philippines have been refused landing by the Philippine government. The following is a record of the notice from the Chinese Consul-General in the Philippines regarding the measures for refugees to go to the Philippines:

In the case of refugees from our country coming to the Philippines, this consulate has already handled it properly. The following are the procedures that all refugees should go through: (1) For each batch of 100 refugees, this consulate will first fill out a letter of guarantee on their behalf and send it to the review committee for review, and publish the names, genders, and numbers of the 100 refugees in the newspapers.

(4) The applicant who obtains the refugee certificate can directly send the refugee certificate to the refugee, so that they can use it to purchase a ticket to the Philippines from the shipping company. (5) The representative of each refugee must report to the consulate two days before the refugee arrives in the Philippines. This consulate will send personnel to board the ship with personnel from the Philippine Immigration Office when the ship docks to verify the refugee's photos and issue another receipt (the receipt states that they should go to the consulate on a certain day to complete the procedures). At the same time, the refugee certificate will be collected, and then they will be released to disembark. (6) After the refugees disembark, they will go to the consulate on the date stated on the receipt issued by this consulate on the ship to complete the procedures, and then the refugee certificate will be returned to them, which will be held by each refugee as proof of staying in the Philippines. (7) The qualifications of the guarantor must have considerable property, shops, or cash. (8) Old refugees who stayed in the Philippines before, if they want to use credit guarantee, they must submit the receipt for six yuan and six jiao issued by this consulate for verification.

The above detailed measures are hereby notified to all overseas Chinese for compliance. This announcement.

### Fuzhou Bombed

The shipping industry received a telegram yesterday stating that at around 9:00 am on the 10th, six Japanese aircraft invaded Mawei, Fuzhou, and bombed it. The losses were not reported in detail, but Fuzhou has suffered heavy losses since it was repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft. Commerce is depressed. Japanese warships anchored in Quanzhou Bay sometimes launch speedboats to patrol the coast, seemingly with some intentions. The local garrison is on high alert.

### Japanese Troops in Daishan Have Not Yet Withdrawn

Since Japanese troops landed on Daishan in Dinghai, they have not yet withdrawn. Recently, they have also forcibly collected fishing taxes and salt taxes, causing considerable unease among local residents. It has been found that the footprints of Japanese troops have spread to Gaoting in the south of the island and Dongsha Cape in the north. As for Changtu Island, the Japanese troops have withdrawn. It has been found that Changtu and Daishan are only separated by a body of water. The Japanese troops are stationed on Daishan and have not withdrawn, and Weitu feels uneasy.

### Litigation Procedures During Extraordinary Times; The Court Orders Efforts to Be Simple and Quick; Delay in Handling May Cause Accidents; A Special Order Is Issued to All Levels of Courts to Pay Attention

For the convenience of the people during extraordinary times, the Judicial Yuan of the National Government specially ordered all levels of courts to simplify the litigation procedures. The original order stated that civil and criminal litigation procedures are cumbersome. During these extraordinary times, if the handling is delayed, not only will the criminal defendants in custody be at risk of accidents, but also the pain felt by both parties in civil cases will be more profound than usual. All levels of courts and prosecutors should understand this meaning and, within the scope permitted by laws and regulations, strive for quick litigation procedures, simple judgments and other documents, so as to save time and facilitate the people. They should be informed accordingly.

### Chartering a Ship to Join a Japanese Merchant Organization; Shipowner Sues for the Return of the Ship; Owner of Fish Market Relies on Chartering the Ship; The Court Orders Both Parties to Attempt Reconciliation

Han Funan, a local resident residing at No. 44, Tongli, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession (49 years old), purchased a steamer before August 13, specializing in sailing to various inland rivers. After the withdrawal of the National Army, he left Shanghai and anchored in Tianshenggang. Until February of last year, Qu Songqing (44 years old), a local resident who opened the Quchangshun Fish Market on Xiaodongmen Street, and his uncle Qu Jiugao, brought out Cai Juming, the old captain of the ship, to charter the ship from Han for

transporting fresh fish

At that time, in addition to signing a contract, the various documents that the ship should have were handed over to Qu Songqing for counting, and Qu issued a receipt. Later, because Qu's uncle did not intend to continue after the three-month lease period expired, the contract was destroyed. However, Qu Songqing personally still wanted to continue the lease, so instead of using the name of Quchangshun Fish Market, Qu brought out Liu Wuzhai, a native of Wuxi, to continue the lease, and he himself was in the position of guarantor. Therefore,

another contract was signed

extending it for two months, so the chartering and all its accessories were not returned by Qu and then delivered again, saving procedures. Unexpectedly, after the expiration date of July 17, 1938, Qu actually estimated the value of the ship and made it a share, joining the "Hainei River Steamboat Company" run by the Japanese, and the ship's name was changed to "Yixing Maru." The shipowner Han Funan learned about this, and immediately entrusted a lawyer to send a letter to question and urge the return of the ship, but Qu ignored it. Therefore, Han could not bear it and hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Liu Wuzhai, Qu Songqing, Yan Shanzhou, etc., for

the return of the chartered ship

and compensation for the ship price totaling 19,200 yuan. At the same time, he applied for provisional execution. The initial trial resulted in the rejection of the plaintiff's claim. After Han received the judgment, he was unwilling to accept it and still hired lawyer Wu to appeal to the Third Branch of the Higher Court. The case was heard by Judge Tong the other day, and both parties were represented by lawyers. The appellate agent stated the reasons for not accepting the original judgment and the appeal in four points: (1) The Ying Shi lawyer hired by the opposing party in the first instance was the former president of the local court, and the judge in charge of the case was his former subordinate, which inevitably

lacked fairness

(2) The appellant transferred the ship to a company run by a Japanese merchant and falsely accused the appellant of being voluntary. If the appellant had entrusted this lawyer to send a letter of inquiry on July 23, 1938, why did he not reply and instead asked his friend Wang Zhiliang to come to discuss mediation? (3) It is said that the ship has been recovered. Why are the contract and insurance policy still in the hands of the appellant? Even if the appellant failed to retrieve and return them at that time, a receipt should be issued to clear the procedures. (4) The current letter from Pan Sansheng, the Chinese manager of the Japanese merchant "Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Company," to Qu Songqing mentions that the ship has been made a share and the

contract period

actually states "Showa, March 15, 1938," which shows that Qu Songqing had long been harboring evil intentions, colluding with Pan, relying on power, and trying to swallow the chartered ship. Later, the opposing lawyer Tang Ying responded to each point and requested that Pan Sansheng, the person in charge of the Japanese merchant "Inland River Steamboat Company," be summoned to court to testify at the next hearing. At this point, the appellate agent immediately stood up to express his opposition, saying that Qu and Pan were in the same voice, so the court ignored it. Then, the witness Cai Juming (the old captain of the ship) was questioned. He testified that when the ship was anchored in Tianshenggang, it was within the

Japanese blockade line

At that time, Qu Xiaokai came to contact me and said that he was familiar with the Japanese and could be responsible for dragging it out, but it had to be chartered to his fish market for use, so I introduced it to the shipowner and signed a charter contract, and I continued to be the captain of the ship. Later, the ship was dragged away by the Japanese merchant, which was agreed to by Qu Xiaokai. After that, my salary was also instructed by Qu to be collected from the company. Qu himself also went to the company every day, but although I am a villager, I am unwilling to continue serving and have now resigned. What I said above is all the truth. We who eat on the boat cannot tell lies. Then, the witness Wang Zhiliang was questioned and testified that both parties are friends. Since the ship was

dragged away by the Japanese

I have been serving as a mediator. Mr. Qu Songqing is a big businessman. This matter was completely wrong, but he knew the desire for profit and recklessly joined the Japanese merchant. If he had returned it at that time, there would not have been litigation. Recently, I heard that the Japanese merchant, "Inland River Steamboat Company," is making a lot of money. According to my observation, this case is easy to reconcile. In the future, I am still willing to mediate, etc. The court reviewed the words and instructed both parties to go out and attempt reconciliation, and adjourned the hearing to another date.

### Tenth Public Bus Runs Over an Old Man

Near the Wuzhen Road Bridge on Xinzha Road, a certain number ten public bus, traveling east to west, sped past at around 10 pm last night. Coincidentally, an old man over the age of 50, wearing white old cloth trousers, was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground, injuring his head and vital parts, and was on the verge of death. When the patrolling police heard the alarm, they rushed to the scene, copied the driver's license number, and urgently transported the injured man to Baolong Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and he died soon after.

### Robbery of a Silk Weaving Factory

The Hengfeng Silk Weaving Factory near the Yanjiachiao of Jixifei Road in West Shanghai has only eight looms, and is a small-scale silk weaving factory, employing a total of only 30 male and female workers. It was jointly opened by Cao of Hangzhou and others. The accountant is Bian Shaoqing of Jiaxing. At around 11 pm the night before (the 10th), more than a dozen bandits suddenly came. Three of the bandits broke into the accounting room with pistols. At that time, the accountant Bian Shaoqing had not yet fallen asleep and was held by the bandits, forcing him to hand over the key to the account box. They only searched for 23 yuan in cash and more than 5 yuan in corner tickets and auxiliary coins. The bandits were still not satisfied, and robbed 12 pieces of Huasi Ge, which had not yet been sorted on the shelf, worth more than 300 yuan, and fled. One

### Kidnapping of a Good Family's Daughter; Criminals Chen Bingwen and Sun Shiqi Arrested; Parents Meet in Court and Cry in Each Other's Arms

The French Police Department of Lujiawan received a secret report the day before yesterday (the 10th) stating that there were criminals selling women in Room 33, Wuling Apartment, Guifu Lane, Bair Road. The West Detective Li immediately led Chinese Detective Wang Guancheng to Room 33 of the apartment and arrested Chen Bingwen (26 years old, residing at No. 8, Yejiazhai, Yanping Road), a native of Changshu, and Sun Shiqi (24 years old, residing at Kangnaot Road), a native of Haimen, and

the young woman Wen Xiu

He was also brought back to the police station. According to Chen's confession, Wei Wenxiu is the legal wife of the people, and she is 21 years old this year. Because of poverty, she had no choice but to sell his wife to others. The price was negotiated at 600 yuan, and there was no illegal behavior. However, when questioned, Wei Wenxiu was vague and seemed to want to say something but stopped, with infinite pain and laughter that were not laughter. The detectives in charge believed that Chen Bingwen was a rough man with a black face, while Wei was a beautiful woman,

a small jasper

With such a woman, it was definitely not Chen's spouse. It was thought that there must be something mysterious about them. Chen and Wei were interrogated separately, and only then did they know that Chen was a big bandit who kidnapped good women and sold them. It was also found that Wei was 17 years old this year, and her father Wei Fuxing was 44 years old this year. He worked as a carpenter in the Tanler Motor Company and lived at No. 34, Yejiazhai, Yanping Road. It was originally a happy little family.

Criminal Chen lives nearby

Specializes in forming gangs to rob in the area beyond the border roads of Yanping Road and Kangnao Road, committing numerous crimes. Seeing that Wei Wenxiu was beautiful, he had bad intentions. On the evening of the 5th of this month at 7 pm, he gathered a few of his party members and threatened to make a scene at Wei's house with a pistol, and then took Wei away and hid her in Wuling Apartment, intending to sell her at a price. The opportunity was not secret, and it was discovered by someone

reported to the police station

Arrested, Sun Shiqi is Chen's accomplice. Later, the detective summoned the woman's father to the case. The father and daughter met and cried in each other's arms. Since the location of the incident was in the public police station, the captain ordered the two criminals Chen and Sun and the woman to be transferred to the Public Concession Police Station for verification.

### Wanting a Divorce; Falsely Accusing the Man of Theft; Sentencing Today

Gu Zhengong, a native of Huzhou, residing at No. 21, Songjiaben, Beijing Road, and running a throat clinic at the Tianshengtang National Medicine Store, No. 64, Xiafei Road, French Concession, is 23 years old this year. He healed the disease of Yin Rongqiu, a Muslim woman from Hubei residing at No. 3471, Yinghua Lane, Robert Road, West Shanghai. Through the introduction of Zhang Shuqiao and Jia Xuewen, they officially married on March 3 of last year, with the condition that Yin's parents would be supported by Gu, and Gu would also join Islam. It is known that not long after the engagement, the feelings of both parties changed,

and disagreements arose

and gradually became worse. Later, Yin Rongqiu sued Gu Zhenghong in the First Special Court for theft of rings, injury, and obstruction of freedom, but the results were all unsuccessful. The woman then filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Gu, requesting the dissolution of the marriage. The reasons given were that Gu's character had changed greatly and his actions were obscene. The case was repeatedly opened for trial by Judge Wu Xiaoke, but it was not concluded. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The case was opened for continued trial the other day. The plaintiff stated the reasons as before. The defendant Gu Zhenghong said, "Our legal marriage must have legal reasons before it can be dissolved. Now the plaintiff is completely falsely accusing me of bad behavior and absurd behavior,

completely false

There is no corresponding evidence to present. It is difficult to agree to the request for dissolution without reason. If the plaintiff has someone else in mind to marry, thinking that it will hinder her marriage, I can forgive the dissolution for the sake of her lifelong happiness and happy family. However, I have spent a lot of money for her. Now the plaintiff is completely instigated by her uncle Yin Zongquan to request dissolution. Please reject it so that we can get married early." Lawyer Wang Xintang also debated for him. The court reviewed the situation and announced the end of the debate, and scheduled the sentence for the 12th (today). However, it is expected that one of the parties in the initial trial judgment will find it difficult to accept and will inevitably appeal. It is not known when the litigation will end.

### Fake Trademarks - Over Seven Hundred Counterfeit Hats Seized - Approval Granted to Confiscate and Further Investigate

The Huacheng Hat Factory at 669 Zhejiang Road, although producing its own goods, often engaged in trademark infringement, thereby gaining substantial profits and filling the pockets of its partners. Now, with the arrival of summer and the popularity of straw hats, they secretly manufactured fake imitations of two types of trademarked felt and straw hats from a famous British factory day and night, mixing them into the market. Unsuspecting buyers were often deceived. The agent of the original trademark hat company investigated and confirmed the counterfeiting, reporting it to the General Inspectorate, who then requested a search warrant from the First Special District Court. On Friday, Chinese Detective Zhu Shouling, along with Western Deputy Detective Breit, were dispatched to the factory address. They seized over seven hundred counterfeit hats. Their styles and English trademark names were entirely identical to the genuine ones, except that the inner brim of the "鼎" brand hats had the added Chinese characters "British Made." The factory owner and others are still under investigation. This morning, the Inspectorate's lawyer Qian Xunjiu went to court to report the search results, requesting the confiscation of the fake goods. Judge Dai Rongduo approved the request, ordering all the items to be confiscated for further investigation.

Major Fire in the Nanshi District

Around 10:15 PM on the night before last (the 10th), a woodpile at the Yang Hongji Construction Factory, located behind the Dongshan Guild Hall on Xiexu Branch Road (Liyuan Road) off Xieqiao Road in the Nanshi district, caught fire due to carelessness. The flames spread rapidly, destroying more than ten factory buildings and affecting the houses of Xie Changen, Zhang Changxing, and others at numbers 46 to 50 on the same street, resulting in eight completely burned down bungalow houses. Fire brigades from various districts in the Nanshi area rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after an hour. The losses are reported to be substantial, but fortunately, no one was injured. Ms. Zhang Gu, a young woman from Ningbo, residing in room number 20 of the First Hotel in an alley next to the Grand Theater on Hankou Road, suddenly had a moment of despair at 10:30 PM last night. She secretly ingested poisonous liquid and attempted suicide. A hotel employee discovered her and immediately reported it to the police, who summoned an ambulance to transport her to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that she ingested too much poison, and her life is in danger. After investigation, it was found that she resided at 3 Deming Lane, Pushi Road in the French Concession. Her suicide was due to economic hardship. Around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a man, identified as A, was walking near Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road in the western part of Shanghai. Suddenly, three thugs jumped out from the side of the road. Two of them drew sharp knives, surrounding the man and preventing him from making any noise. As a result, he was robbed of 25 French currency and the thugs fled with the loot.

### Xin'an Children's Touring Group - 30,000 Li Long March - Sending Representatives to Unite Overseas Chinese - And Hoping for the Efforts of Children on the Isolated Island

The Xin'an Children's Touring Group, the only one of its kind in the country, consisting of sixteen members, with Zhang Jie as the head, Zai Dazhi as the advisor, and Tao Xingzhi as the teacher, set off from Huaian, Northern Jiangsu, on the Double Tenth Festival of 1935. Group leader Zhang Jie once came to Shanghai from the war zone. When he was in Shanghai, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency paid him a special visit and learned that the group, after departing from Northern Jiangsu, had passed through Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, and Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Wuhan and other provinces and cities, as well as more than three hundred small county towns and villages, covering a journey of more than 30,000 li. Now it has a history of eight years. In the places where the group has walked, more than four million people have been awakened, they understand the meaning of the war of resistance, and actively participate in various front and rear tasks. More than five or six hundred thousand children, we have met and made the dearest friends, and have been doing various anti-war propaganda and services in various places. The youngest member of the working group is only eight years old, and the oldest is only seventeen or eighteen years old. Now there will be fifty people. Recently, the headquarters will go to the Northwest to work, but a part of the people will be left in Guilin to organize a new Southwest Working Team, which will work in the southwest and southeast provinces in the future. Recently, a twelve-year-old member was sent alone to foreign countries to promote and call on overseas Chinese children to unite and participate in the motherland's war of resistance. On the one hand, I am sent to meet with the war zone and forced children, hoping to establish a communication office and realize the union and unity of children across the country. At the same time, I also hope that the children on the isolated island will not be deceived by the corrupt.

### Sons of Party, Government, and Military Officials Enthusiastically Enlist - Many Women Also Voluntarily Receive Training - Overseas Chinese Technical Personnel Return to the Country

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the people of the whole country have contributed their material, financial and human resources to the best of their ability, and the conscription in various places has proceeded smoothly. Since the National Government advocated that the sons of party, government, and military officials should take the lead in serving in the military and set an example for the people, various provinces, cities, and counties have promoted this movement. The sons of party, government, and military officials who are of military age (18 to 45 years old) have enthusiastically enlisted. Those who are eligible for deferment have also voluntarily enlisted or entered military schools for training. Currently, many women in the interior have also voluntarily enlisted and received training, so the replenishment of soldiers is extremely abundant. Overseas Chinese have also voluntarily enlisted, and various technical personnel have returned to the country to serve, coming in an endless stream.

### Copper Auxiliary Currency Notes - Market Urgently Needs - Copper Coins Have No Formal Market Price, Substitutes Are Used - Rumor That the Ministry of Finance's Auxiliary Currency Notes Are Being Printed in Shanghai

Since the Ministry of Finance issued an order strictly prohibiting the private export of copper coins, those who violated the order would have all their goods confiscated and be punished according to the law of disrupting finance. Under special circumstances, Shanghai copper coins and coppers were almost completely collected and supplied to a certain party as military equipment. As a result, a serious shortage occurred, and transactions in various industries were greatly affected. Small vegetable markets were originally places where copper coins or coppers were collected. In the past, every time the market closed, vendors would exchange copper coins or coppers for national currency at a discounted price at stores. But this is no longer the case, because copper coins are rarely seen in the vegetable market, causing panic about giving change. Therefore, for purchases below five cents, the coins were refused to give the change. In order to make up for the difficulties, most shops currently use stamps as alternative chips, only those who have obtained stamps cannot use them in stores, so the accumulation of the stores is becoming too difficult. As the number becomes too large, there is no need to send a large number of letters, so the difficulty is also felt. The post office cannot sell more stamps to the stores, so this kind of the stores are creating an obvious pain to the citizens. Therefore, the issuance of one-cent and two-cent auxiliary currency notes is urgently needed. It is heard that these auxiliary currency notes will be issued by the Ministry of Finance and printed in Shanghai, and are currently being rushed to produce. It is rumored that five-cent notes will also be printed.

Profiteers Collect

The one-cent and half-cent copper coins and old coppers minted by the Central Mint that circulate in the Shanghai market were originally very numerous. After the war, profiteers bought them in large quantities and supplied them to a certain party as military equipment. First, they collected old Qing Guangxu coppers with thicker quality, and then, due to the soaring copper prices overseas, ordinary profiteers continued to collect Republic of China flag coppers and one-cent and half-cent copper coins. It is heard that 250 old coppers are worth 3 national currency, and 100 copper coins are worth 1.20 national currency. Therefore, profiteers seek profit and collect them in large quantities from the market, and transport them to a port, where they are loaded onto ships for export to a certain party.

Main Reason for Market Shortage

The Central Bank had previously signed a contract with the tram company and others to collect copper coins and was responsible for issuing new copper coins to circulate in the Shanghai market. After the war, it collected old copper coins and was forced to stop due to the environment. However, it continued to be responsible for issuing new copper coins to circulate in the market. Now, due to the large-scale purchase by profiteers and the government's inability to enforce the ban, it had to suspend the supply. At the same time, because profiteers still buy the coins and causing a shortage of copper coins in the Shanghai market, which has a great impact on all industries.

Exchange Rate No Longer Has Formal Market Price

Most tobacco shops on the market still refuse to exchange auxiliary paper currency for copper auxiliary coins. Occasionally, they exchange one corner of auxiliary paper currency for eight cents of copper auxiliary coins, or one yuan of national currency for eighty one-cent copper coins. Those who exchange feel that there is no difficulty in shopping without copper coins, so even though they know they are losing out, they are willing to do so and do not feel resentful. The Shanghai Tram Company has also issued a notice stating, "Please pay the appropriate fare to the ticket seller, and the ticket seller does not need to give change in copper coins." The public bus company has re-issued the coins that have been collected and replaced copper coins for circulation. The tobacco shops have removed the signs for exchanging copper coins, indicating that there is no formal market price, but they exchange them secretly. Old copper coins are exchanged at 2,500 cash coins per yuan, and new copper coins at 90 per yuan, but they do not allow large amounts to be exchanged. For zero transactions in various industries, stamps or revenue stamps are used instead. Copper coins are also rarely seen in transactions in small vegetable markets. It is heard that the export of Chinese copper coins is 7 million pieces per month, and the collectors are all Japanese military arms dealers, and it is said that most of them flow out of Shanghai.

### Playboy Swindler Jiang Qiu - Transferred to the Second Special Court - The First Special Court Sentenced Him to Five Years in Prison - Many Cases Were Also Committed in the French Concession - Stolen Goods Such as Decorations Were Dragged Out

Jiang Jianqiu from Nanjing, also known as Ye Jianming, is 25 years old this year, of medium build, has an ordinary appearance, is good at talking, and has been jailed for committing crimes. In prison, he studied the magic of seducing women. After being released from prison, he used the means of deceiving women. The first person to be deceived was a prostitute. After sleeping with the prostitute, he pawned the prostitute's clothing and decorations. Then he used the same method to deceive the guides of various guide companies. He used the money he cheated to buy the most fashionable clothes, and went in and out of various parks and major cinemas, attacking young mistresses and aunts. Therefore, there were more than ten cases in the French Concession where young mistresses and aunts who loved the style of light were seduced and gave him gold ornaments or money. Last month, Jiang was arrested by the Public Concession Police Station and sent to the First Special Court for a sentence of five years in prison. The victims in the Public Concession were all prostitutes, dancers and female guides, but most of the 20 victims in the French Concession were mistresses and aunts.

Is the young mistress

and aunt, the French Concession authorities sent people to transfer Jiang to the case and ordered Detective Sui Wenzhi to investigate. Because most of the victims were unwilling to come forward to testify, the investigation procedures were more difficult. The French Concession authorities escorted Jiang Jianqiu to the Criminal Division VIII of the Second Special Court a few days ago, requesting remand for investigation. Magistrate Qiu Xiansheng sat in the chair and questioned him. The defendant Jiang Jianqiu confessed to committing many crimes in the French Concession. Sui Wenzhi, the detective in charge of the case, reported to the court that the defendant Jiang Jianqiu in this case

is a big swindler

and also a big thief, but the victims are all young mistresses and aunts from noble families. It can be said that the defendant is a romantic thief. Although gold ornaments and other objects have now been dragged out, it will take a long time to investigate. The court inquired and ordered the defendant Jiang to be remanded in custody for questioning again on June 21. It is heard that in addition to the young mistresses and aunts, there is also the wife of a Westerner, the manager of a large hotel. Jiang cheated them out of gold red envelopes and gold ornaments worth about tens of thousands of yuan in a few months.

### The Future of Black Market Exchange Rates

— By Bao Leti

Automatic Adjustment, Not Forced Collapse

Nothing is more startling than the recent drastic changes in the black market exchange rates. However, looking at the course of these drastic changes, the cause was clearly the HSBC's automatic adjustment of exchange rates, and even the automatic cessation of selling foreign exchange. This is fundamentally different from a forced collapse, with a clear distinction between subject and object. Although HSBC is a British bank, because it is a major player in the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, it implicitly acted as the representative of the Chinese Ministry of Finance in the black market for foreign exchange. This action of theirs was based on the authorization of the Ministry of Finance, acting on orders. There is no reason to strike oneself. Based on common sense alone, one knows that this sharp drop in the exchange rate is a change in the Chinese government's policy on foreign exchange management, and has nothing to do with the security of the legal tender itself.

Several Ridiculous Speculations in the Market

However, when HSBC initially adjusted the exchange rate against the British pound from eight pence to seven point seven five pence on the morning of the seventh, rumors spread in the market, and all sorts of gossip arose. Some made far-fetched political connections, maliciously slandering, even saying that this was a means by which Europe and the United States were beginning to force mediation of the Sino-Japanese war. Some made reckless speculations about the Exchange Equalization Fund, creating rumors and undermining confidence, even saying that China's foreign exchange reserves had lost more than half due to long-term trade deficits and the illicit buying by the Japanese and puppet regimes. Some asserted that the Chinese government had decided to change its policy of controlling foreign exchange, implementing a devaluation of the currency, and even moving the agency supplying foreign exchange from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Furthermore, because various parties were eagerly awaiting the Ministry of Finance to announce measures to deal with the aftermath of this drastic change in the exchange rate, but the Ministry of Finance remained silent, not revealing any opinion in the past two and a half days, it made people even more suspicious and worried about whether there would be problems with the legal tender itself. In addition, the circulation of copper subsidiary coins in Shanghai gradually contracted, and public transport companies explicitly revealed news of a shortage of copper coins. This strengthened the public's psychology of hoarding copper coins, even to the point of using various substitutes, and even using postage stamps as change. This made people even more pessimistic about the future of the legal tender. Rumors of issuing "drawing slips" and withdrawing five-yuan and ten-yuan legal tender banknotes took the opportunity to resurface.

Statement by the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance

Until now, although the Ministry of Finance has not yet issued a formal order regarding the measures to deal with the aftermath of the black market for foreign exchange, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance, in answering questions from journalists on the tenth, swept away the above-mentioned doubts. Furthermore, from the content of this answer and the illegal nature of the black market where the turmoil occurred, it is likely that the Ministry of Finance will not issue any formal orders.

In answering questions, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance formally pointed out that HSBC's adjustment of exchange rates and restriction of foreign exchange sales had been approved by the Ministry of Finance. At the same time, he earnestly reiterated the determination to maintain the legal tender and indicated the authorities' future policy for managing foreign exchange. The spokesperson's explanation was divided into five points, the main points being:

(1) Maintaining the legal tender is the established policy of the Chinese government. The methods used by the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee to adjust foreign exchange market prices recently have not been changed, and the government's policy is also a measure approved by the government.

(2) Due to seasonal factors in imports and exports, imports are currently increasing, especially the import of non-essential goods. Therefore, adjusting foreign exchange market prices to meet standards that are beneficial to the Chinese economy and maintain a balance of international payments will further consolidate the foreign exchange market.

(3) The government's maintenance of the legal tender's legal price has remained unchanged before and after the war of resistance. Since the management of foreign exchange, public and private institutions that have legitimate needs for foreign exchange, approved by the Ministry of Finance, have been sold foreign exchange by the Central Bank at the legal price. This fact is obvious. As for the difference between the market price and the legal price, since foreign exchange has been managed, this phenomenon is not unique to China.

(4) The government has repeatedly instructed banks to maintain the market in order to reduce market fluctuations, and the results have been quite good. After the establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, the management mechanism has become even more perfect, and the strength of maintenance has been further increased.

(5) Recently, the government has been striving to reduce the import of non-essential goods and has been devising various methods to encourage exports, while also saving foreign exchange, hoping to benefit China's economy and adapt to the needs of the war of resistance. The strength of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee is sufficient to stabilize the market situation. I firmly believe that all parties' confidence in the legal tender will be further enhanced and will not be affected by current market fluctuations.

Information Revealed from This

The wording of this statement is undeniably ambiguous. However, we can at least discover the authorities' active views on foreign exchange control.

Needless to say: the authorities' established policy is to never change, which is to establish and maintain a monetary system suitable for the national economy and capable of serving as the basis for legitimate trade. Up to April 6, China's foreign exchange policy clearly adopted a dual system, or it can be said to have adopted a two-track system. This means that on the one hand, the Central Bank's operations maintained an exchange rate of one shilling and two pence, so that imports that the government considered legal were not adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations. All imports that had been applied for and approved were always sold foreign exchange by the Central Bank at the legal price of one shilling and two pence. But on the other hand, the operations of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee maintained a black market price of eight pence against the British pound. This effect is clearly threefold: First, to prevent speculators from taking advantage of the black market for foreign exchange to stir up trouble; second, to ensure that various imports that have not been approved by the Central Bank are not subject to greater losses due to the constant fluctuations in the black market for foreign exchange; and third, to believe that this black market exchange rate, which is more than 40% lower than the legal rate, can at least implicitly restrict various unnecessary imports. In a nutshell: this dual system is to maintain legitimate import trade and protect legitimate import trade with a legal exchange rate that is more than 40% higher than the black market price. At the same time, it uses a black market exchange rate that is more than 40% lower than the legal rate to restrict imports that are not conducive to China's wartime economy, and stabilizes the foreign credit of the legal tender by stabilizing this black market.

This dual foreign exchange control method has clearly not been changed by this adjustment. In other words: the Central Bank will continue to maintain the legal exchange rate and continue to provide foreign exchange to approved importers. And the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee will continue to operate in the black market, thereby stabilizing exchange rates in the black market. However, whether the black market exchange rate will still be stabilized at the level of April 6 is being reconsidered. Moreover, the black market exchange rate under consideration is hoped to be stable at a level that can implicitly restrict unnecessary imports.

Eight Pence and Import and Export Trade

Before the establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, the black market exchange rate in Shanghai had been stable at the level of eight pence for more than nine months. At that time, there was no equalization mechanism in existence, and of course there was no equalization operation relationship. The emergence and stability of this eight-pence black market rate was entirely accidental, and there was no theoretical basis whatsoever.

The Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee was established and took this eight-pence black market exchange rate as the standard for equalization operations. There is no reason whatsoever, except to assume that it is in line with purchasing power parity. But as mentioned earlier: In addition to eliminating speculative activities and reducing the foreign exchange losses of unauthorized imports, the mission of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee is also to restrict various unnecessary imports and promote the export of domestic products.

However, according to the recent trend of sharp increases in import trade, this eight-pence black market exchange rate, which is lower than the legal exchange rate, is obviously unable to restrain general import trade, especially in Shanghai: The value of imports in the first four months of this year reached 185.7 million yuan, nearly doubling from 68.7 million yuan in the same period last year, accounting for 46.8% of the total value of national imports.

However, It is Completely Different From Devaluation

After the foreign exchange control was implemented last year, there was a period when the exchange rate in the black market drastically diverged from the legal price and fell, until the black market exchange rate naturally stabilized at the level of eight pence against the British pound. In the domestic academic community, there were many people who advocated that the legal price should also be appropriately devalued. The reasons for advocating devaluation of the legal price were nothing more than restricting imports and protecting domestic exports, and even promoting exports, and even attracting remittances from overseas Chinese back to the country as the most powerful. However, in addition to firmly maintaining the foreign credit of the legal tender and refusing to take any action on this, the government authorities have also been carrying out various means to achieve the above-mentioned goals in other aspects, and have achieved extraordinary results. For example, importers can only purchase foreign exchange at the legal price in a very small number of cases. Most of them purchase it at high prices in the black market, which has implicitly restricted imports. At the same time, most of the domestic transportation tools are in the hands of the state, and the state naturally selects imported goods according to their needs and the degree of their need. Secondary and even unnecessary imported goods have also been subject to strict restrictions on transportation. As for the purchase of military supplies from overseas, most of them have already implemented barter trade. The determination of the prices of goods from each other does not require the use of devaluation policies to manipulate. Therefore, it will no longer affect the development of export trade. As for remittances from overseas Chinese back to the country, there have been considerable gains solely from the development of their patriotic hearts, and the existence of the black market is also sufficient for overseas Chinese to choose from.

In the face of these facts, the government has no need to devalue the legal price, so this approval of HSBC's reduction of the black market exchange rate is, of course, completely different from a devaluation policy. Furthermore, we can obtain an opposite proof from the content of the second article of the statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance recorded above.

As mentioned earlier: Currently, because of seasonal factors, imports are quite high, especially the import of non-essential goods has increased even more. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust foreign exchange market prices based on standards that are beneficial to the Chinese economy and maintain a balance of international payments. It is clear that the future level of the equalization black market price will be quite different from the past in terms of method.

(1) The Central Bank will always maintain the legal price of one shilling and two pence, and will certainly not change it. However, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee will abandon the policy of freezing at a certain point (like pegging at eight pence) in its equalization operations in the black market, and will adapt to changing circumstances and take measures appropriate to the occasion based on standards that are beneficial to the Chinese economy and with reference to the seasonal factors of imports and exports.

(2) Although the equalization standard will be adapted to changing circumstances, it must take whether or not it is beneficial to the Chinese economy as the principle of selection. This is clearly completely different from the past pegging policy. Therefore, the new level that will appear in the future is by no means an immutable level. It can be smaller than eight pence, and it can be larger than eight pence.

Crushing the Japanese and Puppet Regimes' Conspiracy to Buy Up

Although everyone knows that Japan relies on the excessive issuance of inconvertible paper money to plunder raw materials and local products from Chinese occupied areas. Besides transporting a portion to its own country to supply its factories for consumption, it also resells another portion of unnecessary items to Shanghai and other parts of China, thereby absorbing legal tender in order to buy up foreign exchange. Needless to say, this scheme of theirs must take the unlimited supply of the black market as a prerequisite, and at the same time, it must have a stable black market exchange rate in order to obtain sufficient profits. Especially in recent months, when the Japanese yen has drastically depreciated against the legal tender and the black market exchange rate of the legal tender has been stable for a long time, the necessity and benefits of their buying up legal tender foreign exchange have become even greater. According to recent reports: they are currently using this method to purchase large quantities of cotton and wheat from overseas for their factories in Shanghai. However, due to this reduction in the foreign exchange black market, it is impossible to import. From this, it can be seen that this drastic change is completely in line with the "national policy of resistance."

However, merely reducing the black market exchange rate to combat the Japanese and puppet regimes' conspiracy to buy up legal tender foreign exchange is absolutely insufficient in reality. Unless it is possible to also devise methods to restrict the supply of foreign exchange in the black market at the same time. Although, during the drastic change in the exchange market, there was once a rumor that the "location of foreign exchange supply would be moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong," there is absolutely no such indication in the statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance. Although this is a major regret, it is sufficient to reflect the fact that the government authorities are mindful of the convenience of Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai, and to reflect the strength of China's foreign exchange reserves.

### New Measures for Legal Tender Exchange

— By Gong Jialin

Since the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Committee in Hong Kong telegraphed Shanghai on the morning of the seventh to temporarily suspend the sale of foreign exchange, a huge storm has been stirred up in the Shanghai exchange market: in two days, it has fallen from eight pence two five to six pence half. The prices of hardware and imported goods in the market have risen, and the price of gold has also been subject to speculative manipulation, rising endlessly. The public, although still ultimately maintaining trust in the legal tender, those with poorer judgment are inevitably agitated by rumors and show panic. Although the Ministry of Finance has not yet issued a formal order regarding the detailed measures for this action, based on the gathering of information from various parties and our own speculation, the government seems to have decided to stabilize the new exchange rate at around six pence half, so as to make it adapt to the balance of international payments, and to impose appropriate restrictions on the supply of foreign exchange in the open market thereafter. Now, we will clarify the points that are prone to misunderstanding by the public regarding these new measures, and describe their significance below.

(1) The Government's Change of Exchange Rate Equalization Does Not Mean Abandoning the Policy of Maintaining the Legal Tender Exchange Rate

We must first point out to everyone that the government's support for the market price of the legal tender did not begin with the establishment of the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund in March of this year; therefore, this temporary suspension of foreign exchange supply by the Equalization Fund is by no means saying that the government will henceforth disregard the market exchange rate. We know that when the government implemented the foreign exchange application and approval law in March of last year, it used gradually reducing approval amounts to ease the decline in the exchange rate. After mid-June, the government even joined forces with HSBC to maintain the exchange rate at a standard of more than eight pence, in order to eliminate the forces of speculation. This exchange rate has been maintained for a long time of ten or more months. In March of this year, in order to strengthen the operational mechanism for stabilizing the exchange rate, it was established with the United Kingdom an Exchange Equalization Fund, in order to place exchange rate stabilization on a stronger foundation. However, we must understand that the policy of establishing this Exchange Equalization Fund to stabilize exchange rates is just like our country's basic military strategy of resisting the war, it is not something that should spare no cost to defend any place. It is not only proper for the government to take expedient measures in consideration of market conditions, but it is also necessary. Today, the government, in view of the sudden increase in non-essential imports, devalues the black market exchange rate to adjust trade, and may raise the exchange rate again in the future due to the movement of the international economic situation. This is equally possible and equally proper.

(2) This Action by the Government is Automatic and Positive.

A country's intervention in the exchange market can be divided into two types: positive and passive. The Chinese government is now stabilizing the black market exchange rate at a new standard, adopting a preemptive positive means. This means that this new measure is by no means forced to suspend sales due to the depletion of foreign exchange funds, but is to strengthen preparations to prevent problems before they occur. We have several very strong bases:

(1) Since the establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund in mid-March to the beginning of this month, it has only been two and a half months. Even according to the most extreme estimate, the 10 million pound Equalization Fund can at least maintain the exchange rate of eight pence for more than a year and a half. There is no reason to use it up in two and a half months. Moreover, the government now has a considerable amount of foreign exchange obtained from export control, which can be used to supplement it at any time, making the Exchange Fund even more consolidated.

(2) Although the two types of counterfeit banknotes in the north and south have tried their best to obtain foreign exchange, according to reliable estimates by foreigners, the legal tender obtained by the "United Bank Notes" in the year since their issuance is not even one-tenth of the amount of legal tender in circulation in North China (i.e., about 30 million yuan), and since the issuance of the "Hua Xing Notes", due to obstacles in circulation, it has only been more than 200,000 yuan. Therefore, the pressure of counterfeit banknotes on the legal tender foreign exchange in these two and a half months is not very great either.

(3) The Chinese government's deposits and cash silver reserves abroad are very sufficient, and there are also loans and remittances from overseas Chinese to replenish them from time to time. Since the start of the war, they have only increased and not decreased. If necessary, it is easy to use a portion of them to maintain the exchange rate of eight pence one five.

(4) Since the implementation of the legal tender policy in 1935, the British and American governments have been making every effort to assist China. The stability of the legal tender is of great benefit to British and American investors with significant vested interests in China. If the legal tender cannot maintain stability, how can they not provide support. It is clear that this action is the result of prudent discussions between China and the parties involved, and is a completely planned and positive policy.

(3) The Significance of the New Measures

Under a managed currency system, the exchange rate of a country's currency is not immutable. If an exchange rate is no longer suitable for national conditions, then maintaining it is not only useless, but also harmful. Especially in Shanghai, the economic center of the occupied area, the government has lost its ability to govern politically. There is indeed room for consideration in the unlimited supply of foreign exchange in the black market. We have said this opinion a long time ago; until recently, with the establishment of the counterfeit "Hua Xing Bank" and the attempt to use the old trick of the "United Bank" in North China to exchange legal tender for counterfeit money to obtain foreign exchange in Central China, we feel even more that the government needs to further control foreign exchange (see my article "The Issuance Policy of Hua Xing Bank and Its Future"). It is now heard that the government intends to adjust the currency exchange rate and stipulate that in the future, legitimate merchants who are unable to apply to the Central Bank for legal foreign exchange can purchase foreign exchange from foreign banks without restrictions with a fixed order form. This action is exactly what we want. Analyzed, it has at least the following four points of value.

(1) Adjusting Trade: One point in the trade of various commercial ports in China in recent months is quite noteworthy, that is, the ports under the government's jurisdiction all have a trade surplus, while the major commercial ports in the occupied areas have huge trade deficits due to the government's lack of power. This division is very obvious: According to customs statistics, in the first quarter of this year, the main ports under the government's control totaled Mengzi with a surplus of 8,121,000 yuan, Huanzhou with a surplus of 285,000 yuan, Leizhou with a surplus of 2,448,000 yuan, Shantou with a surplus of 5,038,000 yuan, and Wenzhou with a surplus of 4,032,000 yuan, totaling about 20 million yuan in surplus in these five places; but in the occupied areas, the two ports of Tianjin alone have a deficit of more than 90 million yuan. Although the government cannot correct this phenomenon by direct methods, it is indeed a smart way to temporarily withdraw the support of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund in the market, and then find a suitable exchange rate to stabilize it. In today's occupied areas, the government cannot use political power to control trade, and this is probably the only effective way.

(2) Reducing Imports of Japanese Goods: In view of the gradual depletion of Japan's gold reserves, Japan has been striving to promote the sale of a portion of its surplus commodities (that is, those that cannot be sold overseas at a good price) to the Chinese occupied areas in order to absorb foreign exchange. However, they are not willing to recover the Japanese yen and military notes in China, so they exchange these banknotes for legal tender, and then transfer foreign exchange. Recently, the export control in North China limited the export of certain local goods to be settled in foreign currency, which is also the reason. The result of the sale of surplus commodities is a sharp increase in Japanese goods imported into China: in the first quarter of this year, it reached as high as 70 million to 80 million yuan, ranking first among the values of goods imported into China from various countries. The legal tender reserves for this huge amount of imports have all been absorbed by the Japanese. If the Equalization Committee restricts the purchase of foreign exchange by the legal tender, then Japan's exports to China will inevitably not be able to obtain foreign exchange (referring to US dollars, British pounds, etc.), or will be exchanged for foreign exchange at a greater cost, then the import of Japanese goods will be reduced invisibly.

(3) Preventing Counterfeit Money From Obtaining Foreign Exchange: The establishment and issuance of banknotes by the counterfeit "Hua Xing Bank" in Central China in the middle of last month is undoubtedly also one of the reasons for this new measure. We remember that when the "United Bank" in North China was established last year, the government implemented the foreign exchange application and approval law, so it is not surprising that the government once again strengthened control with the establishment of—Hua Xing—. Although the circulation amount of "Hua Xing Bank" banknotes is still limited now, we have various reasons to speculate that the Hua Xing Notes—will inevitably tend to expand in the future. In order to prevent problems before they occur, it is necessary to add prevention to the old trick of absorbing legal tender with counterfeit banknotes to obtain foreign exchange.

(4) Making the Planned Export Control in Central China by the Japanese and Puppet Regimes Meaningless: The export of occupied areas is one of the main supplies of foreign exchange in the black market. If the puppet organization really comes out of the way of controlling export foreign exchange (whether it can be done or not is another matter), then the supply of foreign exchange in the black market will inevitably decrease, and the Japanese side's plan to obtain foreign exchange will inevitably be more difficult to implement. It is eating its own fruit.

(4) The Strength of the Legal Tender and the Weakness of the Japanese Yen

After the violent decline of the legal tender exchange rate, the Japanese yen in the Shanghai market, although slightly stronger, is far from reaching the standard it should have reached. On June 7, the day before the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee restricted the supply of foreign exchange in the black market, the price of the Japanese yen in Shanghai was 92 cents, and the price of the legal tender was 8 pence 25; recently, when the legal tender fell to 6 pence half, the Japanese yen should have risen to 1 yuan 17 cents, but in reality it is still hovering within 1 yuan, unable to break through par, which seems quite intriguing. In fact, this is not very difficult to explain. Although the Japanese yen in Japan still maintains an official price of one shilling and two pence on the surface due to the government's strong control, due to the country's financial difficulties, currency inflation, depletion of reserves, deterioration of trade, restrictions on the domestic and foreign use of the Japanese yen, and the gradual failure of the war against China, even Japanese citizens with a strong sense of patriotism have expressed pessimism about the future of the Japanese yen. The depreciation of the Japanese yen shown in the open market in Shanghai is the best evidence. Conversely, the legal tender's reserves are still abundant, it can freely purchase and trade goods domestically, and it can freely exchange foreign exchange abroad. The Japanese also firmly believe in the foundation of the legal tender, so as soon as the exchange rate is slightly favorable, they desperately exchange Japanese yen for legal tender, and as a result, the supply of Japanese yen in the market exceeds demand, and the exchange rate naturally falls back again. This simple fact has already shown us the solid foundation of the legal tender by the Japanese themselves, so why should we doubt it?

### A Review and Outlook on the Sino-Japanese Currency War

— Anshi

1. The Seriousness of the Sino-Japanese Currency War

In modern warfare, victory or defeat can be said to depend on the strength of the economic foundation. The reason why the National Government advocates long-term resistance is also based on the fact that Japan's economic foundation is fragile and cannot withstand a single blow. However, the production methods of capitalists take commodity exchange as a condition for their existence, and commercial exchange must take currency as a medium, so in a certain sense, economic warfare can also be said to be currency warfare. On the front line, there is the hand-to-hand combat of loyal men and soldiers, and in the rear (especially in the occupied areas and the concessions), the legal tender is also constantly engaged in fierce battles with Japanese banknotes and counterfeit coins. If in the future someone writes the record of this Sino-Japanese War and casually dismisses the glorious battle record of this warrior (legal tender), that war record must

I don't have time to talk about the monetary policies of various countries towards China before August 13. However, we must know that in a certain sense, China's monetary policy in this Sino-Japanese War can be said to be one of the reasons why Japan had to risk a desperate gamble. Therefore, Japan's policy towards the legal tender is actually of very important significance and practical nature. Because of the solid foundation of the legal tender and the nationalization of silver, Japan foresaw the difficulties and obstacles of the monetary war against China at the beginning of the war. Even in North China, which they were confident would be relatively problem-free, they tasted a lot of hardship! (To be continued)

Commercial News

### Finance   Hong Kong Dealers Continue to Inquire; Cash Prices Remain Firm

Yesterday, the unofficial market for current silver dollars remained stable.  Due to the Sunday holiday, few members were present.  Reportedly, the market was very strong. Although Hong Kong dealers had aggressively bought at the high price of $2,280 the day before, there was still a profit of $100 to be made by shipping to Hong Kong.  Therefore, there was continued interest.  Numerous inquiries were made at money exchange shops, with offers of $2,475.  However, sellers were asking for $2,485.  The exchange rate for gold jewelry remained unchanged.  Da Tong Hang was still quoting $250.  Xin Tong Hang was at $248 for selling and $242 for buying.  Furthermore, according to a London cable dated the 10th, the price of pure gold remained fixed at £7 8s 5d per ounce.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Continue to Weaken

According to London cables, Indian silver sales lacked support, and the market remained flat.  The spread between near and far term contracts narrowed by 0.0625.  A New York silver cable reported that spot prices remained unchanged.  A Bombay silver cable stated that Indian silver was weak, with spot prices down 5 annas, June futures down 6 annas, and July futures down 9 annas.

### Trading Copper Coins: Profit and Loss, Nickel Coins and Small Change Also Robbed

Recently, copper coins have become increasingly scarce, and small coins are also rare. Making change in small transactions has become quite difficult.  Taking public transportation or streetcars is especially inconvenient. Although various newspapers have reported on this issue, they have mostly offered superficial commentary and have failed to uncover the truth.  Here, I will describe the reasons for these purchases.

Two hundred copper coins weigh approximately 2.5 "jin" (approximately 2.75 pounds) on the market scale and can be sold for one yuan in legal tender, yielding a profit of 50%. The dragon-patterned copper coins from the late Qing dynasty are valued the highest and weigh the most. Certain parties collect them, store them in wine jars, and transport them by wheelbarrow. Those who collect, trade and transport these coins in China are mostly opium dealers and unscrupulous citizens. They search everywhere, or go to the countryside to buy, where they can purchase them for 20 to 30 fewer coins per yuan. After collecting them, they transport them to Hongkou. Fewer money exchange businesses are involved in the trading and transport of these coins, only a certain money shop north of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road.  Dozens of bags of coins have been seen being transported there.  These are truly examples of people flocking together. Other organized collectors, such as copper skin factories and foundries, melt the coins into copper ingots and sell them to goldsmith shops, shipyards, or export merchants, making even greater profits. The current market price for copper ingots of 99% purity is 85 yuan per "dan" (approximately 110 pounds). Copper ingots of 70% purity sell for 65 yuan per "dan." Foundry copper material sells for 50 yuan per "dan."

Small change used to be closely related to copper coins. Since the old ten-cash copper coins disappeared, opium dealers have stopped supplying them. Some exchanges offer ten-cent pieces, with the exchangers finding small coins to provide as change. The demand has become so great that there is now a black market. One yuan in legal tender can only buy 90 small coins, and even then it is difficult to obtain them. Certain parties are also very eager to buy small coins, offering only 80 small coins for one yuan in legal tender. With unbacked paper money, even buying ten or twenty small coins is like finding something for nothing, let alone obtaining more than that.

Nickel coins have not been in circulation for long, and the quantity is not large. After the Nationalist army moved west, nickel coins were shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Recently, certain parties, relying on military force, searched foreign ships repeatedly and confiscated all nickel coins being transported to Shanghai.  The looting of the public is even harder to describe. With the source of nickel coins cut off, the number in circulation is decreasing daily. Furthermore, the material of nickel coins is more valuable than copper or lead, so they are being bundled up and taken away.

During the early Republic of China and the warlord era, excessive minting of copper coins in Hunan and Hubei resulted in large copper coins (worth 20 cash) being exchanged at over 300 coins per yuan, or over 600 single copper coins per yuan. Single copper coins from Hunan and Hubei flooded the market in Shanghai, causing the exchange rate to fall and prices to rise. After the January 28th Incident, one yuan could be exchanged for over 380 coins. When small coins first came into circulation, they were also exchanged at over 320 coins per yuan. In the past year or two, the rate has been fixed at the legal price and has not changed. Recently, certain parties have been collecting them in large quantities for use as raw materials for munitions. However, certain parties have been collecting copper coins and smuggling them out of the country for several years. Stevedores and sailors on Yangtze River steamers transport large copper coins and resell them to money shops in Hongkou, who then sell them to certain parties for private export. With so many people involved in the smuggling, the accumulated losses are incalculable. Counting the coastal ports and North China, the annual smuggling of copper coins reaches over 50 million yuan. What has been cast and accumulated over decades is flowing eastward in a torrent in the shortest period of time, and it is feared that this will not stop until everything is exhausted. The smuggling was especially rampant before the August 13th Incident in 1937. In North China, Japanese adventurers were engaged in large-scale smuggling. In Shanghai, when certain foreign ships were leaving the port, Japanese adventurers would travel in groups, openly carrying away gold bars, silver coins, and copper coins, refusing any interference. This cannot simply be described as smuggling. As the Jiangnan regions fell, the gold and silver sold in European and American markets were all treasures of our country. The recent soaring gold prices and plummeting exchange rates may also stem from the same causes as the outflow of gold, silver, and copper coins. (Yuan)

### Food  Speculators Active, Rice Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, shipments from upriver were blocked, and no goods arrived. However, wheelbarrow and "baozi" (steamed bun) dealers from the Sikhs area brought 3,400 to 3,500 packages. The market is currently using the price of foreign rice as a benchmark. After the excitement, the momentum remained strong yesterday. From the opening of the market, speculators continued to actively buy, and other businesses followed suit, causing the market to tighten. Local merchants also took the opportunity to enter the market, so sales were brisk. Sellers raised their prices. High-quality "Chang Jing" rice was bid at $18.50, but ultimately sold for $18. The prices of other northern and southern "Jing" rice varieties also rose by 2 to 3 "jiao" (10 "jiao" = 1 yuan). The price of top-grade "Bo Dao" rice only increased by one "jiao," as its price was already high, while ordinary "Shi" grade rice increased by 2 to 3 "jiao." "Du Yang Jian" and "Bu Ke Jian" rice varieties were also very active, similar to the "Jing" rice market, and prices increased by 3 "jiao."

### Dried and Preserved Goods Raw Peanuts Tighten

Raw peanuts had previously arrived in shipments of over 4,000 packages. Two attempts to clear these holdings failed to result in any sales. However, since the changes in foreign exchange rates, the market has tightened. This is because the transportation from Qingdao to Shanghai has been restricted by certain parties, and the foreign exchange rate is also a factor. Yesterday, it was reported that over one hundred small packages were traded at a price of $19. The market price may increase slightly in the future.

### Longkou Noodles Scarce and Expensive

Fine noodles and dried noodles have become scarce recently, and market prices have risen repeatedly. Longkou noodles are selling for as high as $80. It is reported that stores that stocked up earlier at high prices have been selling at a loss. In addition, Qingdao noodles are scarce, while Jiangbei noodles are commanding a high price of $33.

### Sugar Market Prices Fluctuate Then Stabilize

Yesterday, there were no telegrams from London regarding the sugar market. According to a telegram from Hong Kong, the cost of coarse white sugar to Shanghai is HK$10.60, which is difficult to reconcile. However, the Shanghai Sugar Association's prices, which had been rising for several days, have now stabilized. Spot prices for "E4" grade coarse white sugar from local warehouses are at $29.20, while outside warehouses are still asking $29. 100 bags of re-exported sugar were traded at $29.70. Local warehouses sold 70 bags of "Da Jin Qian Ma Ke" sugar at $29.60. Taikoo brand white sugar: "B Mark" at $29, "C Mark" at $28.80, "CX Mark" at $18.50, "DY Mark" at $27.40, "HX Mark" at $27.20. The other grades have not changed. Guangdong Sugar Company offered 100 bags of "Diao Qing" sugar at $11.10. Guangdong and Hong Kong dealers were asking $14 for Hainan red sugar, but no sales were made.

### Several Harms of Excessive Indulgence, and Their Medical Remedies

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of a Russian Labor University

Animals have the instinct to reproduce to prolong the species. Sexual desire is a manifestation of this instinct. However, if this sexual desire is excessively indulged, it will greatly harm various parts of the body, especially shortening human life, which has been consistently verified by doctors in various countries.

Therefore, to prevent premature aging and prolong life, in addition to paying attention to daily diet and habits, one should regulate one's sexual life. Modern medicine has advanced greatly. It has been proven that the harm to brainpower, the weakening of sexual function, and the obstacles to fertility caused by excessive indulgence are becoming increasingly clear and verifiable.

Engaging in sexual behavior before the body and mind are fully developed can also be regarded as excessive indulgence. Furthermore, if the body is inherently weak and lacking, even engaging in sexual intercourse only once or twice a month causes extreme fatigue, then these one or two instances of sexual behavior may also be considered excessive. All activities that weaken the body's health should be avoided by those seeking offspring.

According to the most advanced medical judgment of modern times, long-term abstinence is also not a good way to maintain health. Therefore, a person's sexual behavior must be determined based on his or her health condition. For young people aged sixteen or seventeen, every drop of semen is material needed to lay the foundation for future health. At this time, if one commits self-abuse or becomes dissolute, the result will be great damage to the body. Headaches, head heaviness, tinnitus, palpitations, forgetfulness, insomnia, and various other symptoms of premature aging and kidney deficiency will appear. Therefore, young people under the age of twenty should remain celibate, regardless of how favorable the environment may be. However, if one frequently engages in self-abuse, then a different approach is needed.

In addition to the above symptoms, excessive indulgence can also cause a sudden decline in sexual ability. Premature ejaculation, kidney deficiency, and infertility may follow. The best treatment is to take the German "Bit Maru" essence preparation for men, "Bu Ti Kang." This agent is composed entirely of extracts from calf, deer, orangutan, seal, goat testicles using scientific methods to extract their essence. Imagine using the essence of robust animals to supplement the deficiency of human body essence. It will naturally exert its great therapeutic effect. I have clinically confirmed that it has the functions of tonifying the brain, blood, and kidneys. The female version is a good medicine for regulating menstruation and promoting fertility.

Modern Medicine

### New Principles for the Radical Cure of Gonorrhea

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Doctor of Medicine

Gonorrhea is not truly incurable. The reason why it is difficult to cure is that it becomes a chronic condition due to delayed or incorrect treatment. The best approach is to seek correct medical treatment as early as possible to achieve a cure. However, if the disease is prolonged, the virus will penetrate deeper. How can one expect a radical cure in a short period? However, this statement only refers to the difficulty of achieving a radical cure of chronic gonorrhea in the shortest time. It does not mean that it cannot be cured. Because once gonorrhea becomes chronic, the toxins are no longer concentrated in the urethra but are scattered throughout various parts of the body. Therefore, treatment takes longer than treating acute gonorrhea. Patients should be calm and trust the doctor's treatment.

However, I often see gonorrhea patients who, because their illness cannot be cured immediately, inevitably show anxiety. The general medicines on the market cater to this desire, claiming that their medicines can definitely eradicate the disease in a short time. Gonorrhea patients, regardless of their methods, compete to take these medicines. As a result, they often fail to achieve the desired results and are disappointed. Or their condition may be even worse than before they were ill. This is because they do not know the truth about gonorrhea and make such mistakes. Because there is no such thing in the world as a gonorrhea medicine that can cure the disease in one or two days as in mythology.

In my experience, the medicine that best meets my ideal is "Ke Lin Nong," invented by Dr. Peter of Germany. This medicine is based on non-specific therapy and is made from a mixture of protein and pigment. It has been gradually improved through thousands of field tests and tests in famous venereal disease hospitals in various countries, until it has reached a state of perfection. It is completely different from the crudely manufactured medicines on the market. All cases of new and old leukorrhea that have not been cured by various city doctors' surgeries, injections, and various over-the-counter medicines can be completely cured by taking "Ke Lin Nong" within three to five weeks. In addition, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used externally! For female gonorrhea leukorrhea, "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" can be used as suppositories, which are especially effective.

### The Latest Good Medicine for Curing Lung Diseases

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Although doctors in various countries have made inventions for the treatment of lung diseases, the power of tuberculosis has continued to increase. There are few medicines with special effects. The commonly used medicines can also be effective for a while, but they are not absolutely effective. Therefore, both doctors and patients suffer. However, medicines composed of iodine and calcareous matter have the effect of improving physical fitness and the mechanism of treatment, and have a strong bactericidal power. The medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" was invented based on the above principle. This product is truly effective for lung diseases. All symptoms such as hemoptysis, sputum, coughing, dyspnea, chest pain, bloody sputum, loss of appetite, night sweats, pale face, and emaciation can be miraculously cured by taking it. Because it can fill calcareous matter and heal the cavities in the lungs, it has remarkable effects on all stages of lung disease.

### Do Young Men Who Masturbate and Have Nocturnal Emissions Have the Qualifications to Be Husbands in the Future?

— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Doctor of Medicine

There are so many young men who masturbate and have nocturnal emissions. Although we in the medical community constantly advise them, only a few can truly break away from their evil ways and reform. In every corner of society, there are still many young men engaging in their sexual sins to satisfy their desires. Over time, not only will their entire will be exhausted, but marriage will also become a serious problem.

Because masturbation can quickly destroy sexual function and lead to a state of hypersensitivity, people who masturbate will inevitably experience premature ejaculation after marriage. Especially young men during puberty, often suffer from nocturnal emissions due to masturbation. Constant leakage of essence and blood will hinder and stop their development, leading to impotence and kidney deficiency. Young men with premature ejaculation, impotence, and kidney deficiency are hated by every woman because they cannot have a happy sexual life and bear the responsibility of giving birth to children. Therefore, such people are not qualified to be husbands. However, in medicine, the newest way to restore the health of such people is to take the testicular essence preparation "Bu Ti Kang." Those who have nocturnal emissions should take "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to be effective. Therefore, those who suffer from this kind of problem should wake up as soon as possible.

### Leukorrhea Easily Leads to Sexual Neurasthenia

— Narrated by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: Intersection of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road, No. 9

……Sexual nerves are extremely fragile and sensitive, so they are easily weakened.

……Therefore, it is best to cure it before the gonococci enter the deep internal reproductive organs such as the testicles.

The reason why gonorrhea easily destroys sexual function is that gonococci often cluster in the reproductive organs. This is because gonococci have the ability to escape, and the external reproductive organs and internal reproductive organs have the urethra as a channel of communication. The most obvious example is that they invade the prostate and testicles through the posterior urethra, causing prostatitis and orchitis. Of course, once these diseases occur, they are extremely likely to damage the patient's sexual nerves. Therefore, we must be extremely careful in treating gonorrhea. If we are careless, we may cause the prostate and testicles to collapse. Therefore, once we know that a gonorrhea patient has prostatitis, we must quickly find a way to cure it. If we delay for a moment or misdiagnose it, gonococci will often invade the inside, and there is a risk of complications of orchitis.

How can we avoid these dangers? If we can ask a doctor with experience and responsibility to treat us, we can avoid these adverse outcomes. Before orchitis occurs, we can use agile massage and German static electricity therapy, and the holy medicine "Ke Lin Nong" for gonorrhea, to quickly save the situation and eliminate gonococci. Then, the symptoms of prostatitis can be completely cured, and the symptoms of gonococcal neurasthenia (such as prostatic leakage, nocturnal emission, and premature ejaculation) can also be cured, and the original healthy performance can be restored. Do not delay and make mistakes, lest you cause disharmony in your future marital love and regret it. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. From today, 20 free consultation tickets will be given out every day. Each ticket will cost only five jiao and will include a complimentary copy of my book "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan.

### Where Do Young People's Old Hobbies Come From?

— Xiaoren

A few years ago, someone copied the words of old writers from the "May Fourth Movement" era to guide young people. These words were: "To make new literature good, old literature must have a foundation!" During the May Fourth Movement, this was a brilliant plan by old writers. At that time, because new literature had won, old writers felt the danger and came up with this sentence to both hold on to old literature and send a "flirtatious glance" to famous new writers. But now, some people are also saying this, but they are "genuine" new writers. The effect is like some young writers are writing better than them, and they can't stand it, so they bring out old literature to intimidate them. The meaning is: "Don't be smug, that kind of writing will never work!" Naturally, this does stabilize their position to a certain extent, but it really doesn't benefit young people. In the past, old writers used this sentence to lure a group of new people to climb up, become sages, talk nonsense about national affairs, and open several so-called national studies book catalogs. But this time, it can only make young people feel dejected and dare not write anymore. This is called "each generation is inferior to the previous one." In the end, apart from causing young people to develop old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, it doesn't leave anything behind.

And at the same time, came square poetry. That was super new, and the authors were mostly people who understood foreign languages and even declared that they were imitating some foreign style. But readers were very strange and couldn't appreciate that kind of art. They had to fall asleep to read it. This secretly responded to the old writers' prediction: "Chinese literature is fundamentally different from foreign literature. Imitating foreign literature will make it unrecognizable!" And the facts were indeed correct. The poems were written in squares and had no poetic flavor! Then, it's better to have five-character or seven-character poems, which are much more straightforward. So, some new writers came out and slapped themselves, saying that it was still questionable whether new poetry could stand on its own. As a result, old poetry really raised its head. You wrote one, I wrote one, and everyone rolled up their sleeves and started writing. In the end, apart from causing young people to develop old hobbies that even they themselves didn't understand, it didn't leave anything behind.

I don't know how it happened, but suddenly there was a quarrel between the "Beijing School" and the "Shanghai School." The conclusion of the quarrel was: "The Beijing School is good, the Shanghai School is not." So, the "Shanghai School" bravely rose up and followed the "Beijing School." From then on, a big trend was created. "Spirituality literature, real literature, and record literature are the advanced literary styles." The ancestor of "spirituality" was originally a prose style of the Ming Dynasty, but soon it expanded to the so-called "rare books." Naturally, this was good, but some "books" were really not "rare." Later, even Ye Shaoyuan's semi-true and semi-false poetry collection for his wife became a treasure that young people had to read. "Record literature" is not like the rambling of colloquial literature, which is of course also good because it can save paper. But the paper saved was used to print classical Chinese and old poems, and the strangest thing was that the masters of the "spirituality" school also brought out "A Rustic's Exposure." This trend really made people dizzy. In the end, needless to say, apart from causing young people to develop old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, it didn't leave anything behind.

On the teacher side, the movement was first initiated by the "Beijing School" elders. If a student wrote a wrong word on the exam, the examiner would pick up the pen and ridicule him greatly, and the method of ridicule was also to write old poems, oil-slang old poems. This made the younger generation of the "Shanghai School" envious, so they advocated that young people specialize in vocabulary in ancient books. Whether young people specialized in it or not, no one seems to have investigated, but judging from the tone of the advocates, if they didn't specialize, they would be deducted points. And in fact, it's really no wonder, many Chinese language test questions in universities are taken from ancient books, either the "Book of Changes" or "Rhetoric", as if the older the more suitable. In fact, the people who put out those questions may not be able to know them all without looking up the books. If they were to take the exam as students, they might even hand in a blank paper. But in short, the result is needless to say, the more so, it is besides causing young people to develop old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, it didn't leave anything behind.

These are all the achievements of our celebrities. Counting them, naturally, there aren't many, but just these few are already enough to pull some young people back on the wrong track. I agree with Mr. Shang Qing's suggestion a few days ago that all teachers should seriously give young people some good guidance. But is it really possible to do it in practice?

### Vow to Sweep Away the Tartar's Lands, Regardless of Personal Safety (Woodcut)

— Li Yishan

### The Pit (Part Two)

— Dian Chang

I looked straight ahead and saw only two legs moving closer, so I bent down and dug; suddenly there was a clap and they turned away again, the sound of footsteps gradually faded from my ears, and I took a breath again, and pushed all the mud back, making the pile on the ground even higher.

I thought, if that guy came from behind and kicked me a few times, sweeping all the mud down, I would be buried here.

The sweat on my forehead was dripping: Was I really digging my own grave? Was this my tomb? Alas, the more I thought about it, the more I felt cold... so I hurriedly turned around, stood on tiptoes and looked around, and then hurriedly cut out a few steps of mud steps on the pit wall.

After a while, I did hear a faint sound of footsteps in my ears, so I squeezed the shovel, stepped on the pit wall with my right foot, turned backwards, and then stood still.

I immediately stepped up one step, my heart was jumping and jumping non-stop, but I saw that guy holding a rifle and aiming at a runner in front.

"Bang--" The gunshot pierced the sky, and I hurriedly shrank down, waited for a while, and then used the shovel to prop myself up to take a look, the two legs in front were shaking and shaking and retreating, the guy's knees bent left and right, and then he stood still.

"Bang--" I thought the person running was finished, so I lay on the side of the pit and listened quietly, the sound of leather boots rubbing the ground was very clear, I stood on tiptoes again, the two trembling legs were only five or six feet away from my head. Suddenly, I unconsciously mustered my strength and suddenly climbed out of the pit wall with the shovel, lay on the ground and rolled over; but that guy immediately turned his head very keenly and stabbed down with the rifle like a mad dog at me.

"Bang--" My eyes went dark, and I mustered my strength to stand up against the gunshot, and took advantage of the momentum to hit him squarely on the shoulder with the shovel, and he fell down stiffly.

I wiped the sweat on my forehead and smiled proudly at this horizontal yellow candle. I looked into the distance again, and that person was walking towards this side.

"Haha, is that you, Egret No. 8?" I saw clearly that it was him, so I shouted, "I saved your life!"

He walked closer slowly, holding a Mauser in his hand, and said calmly, "I've been watching you dig a grave over there for a long time, now bury him." I went over to take a closer look, but the ground was full of blood, and I looked at how deep the wound on his shoulder was - this was my masterpiece, such a powerful chop.

But that guy's shoulder wasn't even broken, and the blood was gurgling from his back.

I understood, and greeted Egret No. 8 shamefully:

"I've been digging a grave for this grandson for a long time, I'm really exhausted: Thank you, can you help me carry him into that pit?"

### Bēn Quán (Rushing Spring)

— Dīng Dì (Ding Di)

"Glorious spring! May my heart be like your new flock, enduring, upward, and ever-renewing." ——HewoI

Rushing spring, I love its powerful surging.

Not the moldy, stagnant water in the dark pool, not the ever-still waves confined to a narrow river, not as soft, frivolous, and weak as lake water, nor as flat, merely spreading to both banks: it surges upward, with streams of force, constantly expanding upward, the air unable to suppress it, galloping, twisting like a swimming dragon. The long days and months drag a gray, hazy shadow, and in that haze, the spring's sound plays an unceasing song of joy. In the haze, there are glittering golden scales.

There is no stopping, the water will never run dry, in mountain streams, in valleys, amidst the scattered, withered vines and chaotic leaves, go search, there you will always find a pool of emerald green ripples, in the deep, secluded depths of small cliffs, hanging down a strip of silvery light, shimmering in the sun, also mixed with mountain red flowers, small grass and leaves, rushing and roaring, showing the great joy of nature, the high song of vibrant life.

Exploring the endlessness of the spring source, what you feel is not disappointment, not vagueness, you will therefore further expand the realm of life.

For example, let's say life is a rushing stream. Life should have a core, just like, when we eat apples, pears, or walnuts, don't they all have an annoying core? Exploring this core is no different from peeling a fruit at will or cracking the hard shell of a dried fruit. Pursue the truth of life, just like, exploring the ultimate source of the spring.

But is there no truth forever? I know it has a core. "Pursue that truth."

I say, "I love that spring source."

I remember the scenes I saw two years ago.

It was outside the mountain gate of Hupao Spring. New green tinged the mountain slopes. A burst of fragrance floated up, mountain mist struck my brow, my brow was pale. In the cracks of the rocks, leaning against the earthen cliffs, a row of trees on the cliffs, somewhat irregular, yet seemingly chaotic. The shade of the trees covered the spring water, the gurgling whispers, a continuous sound, penetrated the shadows. Like a rope tied to the ear, the sound of the spring followed me as I walked, walking up the stone steps…

Also in Hangzhou, in the dim and heavy Phoebe zhennan forest, going to Jiuxi Shiba Jian (Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gullies), turning a few bends on the road, I entered a suddenly open realm. Bubbling with latent force, flowing through the narrow cliffs, a few spirals, impacting the mountain rocks, splashing open grains of water droplets. Looking back, I gradually walked away, looking at the white stone, I thought, when did it start flowing? I calculated it for it.

In the cold weather, it keeps moving, surging upward, flowing downward. Now I'm calculating it for it, it's still flowing. Flowing into winding streams, from the valley: hidden among withered branches and chaotic leaves, carrying a fallen red small boat, and flowing again into the unknowable. Maybe returning to the valley?

When leaving Hangzhou, I calculated for myself, it's been exactly two years. The old spring water, I don't know where it has flowed, even a small homemade fountain in my goldfish bowl has long been destroyed without a trace. Am I disappointed? No, I know the spring is still flowing, flowing every second, tirelessly, without rest.

If you block it with stones, maybe you see the unfortunate temporary stopping of the spring, but when the power of this spring breaks through the obstacle, you know it is more powerful than before. Grasping the long-term life, the spring never dies.

No one has ever subdued the spring, we know that many stones have rotted.

### Xīng Huǒ (Spark)

— Shǔguāng (Dawn)

In the hazy future,

A spark flashed out,

Bright!

Eyes, deeply buried in the dark earthen tomb,

Spent nineteen years of suffering,

Only now touched the torch of freedom.

Left hand propping up in the mud,

Right hand holding onto the mountain rocks beside me,

Stepping in one foot,

Then closely following the next step.

Who is it, that scattered this slippery layer,

Making me falter, unable to open my pace?

Looking back is a stretch of black with dancing ghosts,

Only ahead rises a spark.

Go!

### Jiùjīnshān Huáqiáo Qíngxíng (Situation of Overseas Chinese in San Francisco)

In the port of San Francisco, there are approximately over one hundred thousand Chinese people, all independently operating, seeking food to make a living; the wages vary, the lower end being more than twenty gold per month, and the higher end approaching one hundred gold. Those manufacturing leather shoes, although engaged in a small business, are uniquely profitable. However, the locals are jealous and resentful of the Chinese, which has happened more than once, because they are seizing their lucrative businesses. They are constantly thinking of taking up arms against them, and these people are all from Willis, England, who are impoverished and unable to make a living. Since the opening of the port of San Francisco, they have been cultivating the land here, raising children and grandchildren. Once the Chinese take over their businesses, they hold a grudge and are determined to kill them to vent their anger. As for the Americans, they treat the Chinese quite well, and local officials protect them from time to time. However, the locals are numerous and powerful, while the Americans are few and insufficient to suppress them. Recently, a wheeled railway has been built from the main port of San Francisco to New York, making travel convenient. If there is an emergency and troops are dispatched, they can arrive in seven days, so there is no need to worry about the locals engaging in rampant cruelty.

### Hǎijūn Shǐ Yāntái (Navy Sails to Yantai)

The nation has already ordered Guangdong to dispatch sixteen old-style warships and six steam-powered warships, all of which will sail to Yantai between summer and autumn, awaiting deployment. From current speculation, it is suspected that this is related to the situation in Taiwan, and that there will be military action. Therefore, large ships are being gathered to transport soldiers.

Governor Zhang of Wuzhong was about to visit a guest, and the sedan umbrella and flags were all waiting. Suddenly, a military officer came to pay his respects, and the Governor had no choice but to meet with him. Before the guest left, the Governor's sedan chair soared into the air. Only a sudden whooshing sound was heard, and smoke and flames filled the sky. The green felt sedan chair turned into a red fireball, as it was a gunpowder explosion. In shock, the Governor summoned all the officials and interrogated them, learning that it was done by a dismissed patrol officer. The arrival of the military officer, neither too early nor too late, saved the Governor from the fire disaster, which was quite a coincidence.

### Chéngzhì Tānwū zhī Lìfǎ Yángé (Legislative Evolution of Punishing Corruption)

— Jìng (Quiet)

The National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Corruption on June 27 of last year, consisting of eleven articles in full, effective from the date of promulgation.

Criminal officials, the chapter on dereliction of duty in the criminal law, originally had very detailed provisions. However, at this time, the nation is in a critical autumn of survival, soldiers, civil servants, and those handling public welfare affairs, at this dangerous juncture, should be careful and self-disciplined, and devote themselves to diligent governance. What heart and soul do they have to harbor thoughts of corruption, being traitors to the nation above and villains to the people below? This is why the government, in addition to the chapter on dereliction of duty in the criminal law, has specially promulgated special criminal laws, also in the spirit of "using heavy penalties to govern a chaotic country."

Criminal officials have been heavily punished in all dynasties' criminal laws. Before the Qin and Han dynasties, regardless, Li Kui's Legal Canon listed accepting bribes and perverting the law as the first chapter on theft of law, because although bribery is not theft, its greedy heart is no different from theft, the evil of which can be imagined. In the Xiao Code's section on official duties, those in charge who accepted bribes and perverted the law were given one hundred strokes of the cane; one bolt of silk added one degree; fifteen bolts of silk, strangulation. Those who did not pervert the law were given ninety strokes of the cane for one chi (unit of length); two bolts of silk added one degree; thirty bolts of silk, exile. Those without salary were reduced one degree each. Those who perverted the law, twenty bolts of silk, strangulation. Those who did not pervert the law, forty bolts of silk, exile. The punishment in the Ming Code was even more severe, with a special section on accepting bribes, stipulating that those with salary who perverted the law and accepted bribes, seventeen strokes of the cane for one guan (unit of currency) or less; increasing sequentially, adding exile for twenty guan or more; those accepting bribes in four instances of legal infractions, seventeen strokes of the cane for one guan or less; increasing sequentially, adding exile for twenty guan or more; over forty-five guan, exile; up to eighty guan, strangulation; those who did not pervert the law and accepted bribes, sixty strokes of the cane for one guan or less; over fifty guan, penal servitude; over one hundred guan, exile. Unsalaried individuals who perverted the law and accepted bribes, one hundred and twenty guan, strangulation. Unsalaried individuals who did not pervert the law and accepted bribes over one hundred and twenty guan, the crime was limited to one hundred strokes of the cane and exile of three thousand li. This continued until the Qing Dynasty, without being mitigated, that is, in the current criminal law of the late Qing Dynasty, accepting bribes, officials accepting money, also stipulated that salaried officials accepting one tael or more would be punished in seven degrees, increasing sequentially, penal servitude for over twenty taels, exile for forty-five taels; strangulation for eighty taels. Those who did not pervert the law and accepted bribes, six degrees of crime for one tael or more; penal servitude for over fifty taels, exile for over one hundred taels; strangulation for over one hundred and twenty taels. Unsalaried individuals who perverted the law and accepted bribes, one hundred and twenty taels, strangulation; Unsalaried individuals who did not pervert the law and accepted bribes over one hundred and twenty taels, the crime was limited to exile of three thousand li. Since the Republic of China, since the Provisional New Criminal Law, there have been special chapters on dereliction of duty; however, in the third year of the Republic, the Law for Punishing Officials and Clerks Who Commit Bribery was promulgated, although the provisions were few, the punishment was especially severe. A certain Wang, the magistrate of the capital, was sentenced to death under item two of that regulation for receiving bribes and engaging in conduct that violated his duties, marking the beginning of applying special laws to bribery cases. This law was repealed by decree in July of the fifth year of the Republic. In March of the tenth year of the Republic, the Regulations for Punishing Officials and Clerks Who Commit Bribery were promulgated again, with a fixed implementation period of three years. The term was not extended upon expiration. After the establishment of the National Government, orders and injunctions were repeatedly issued regarding honesty and prohibiting official misconduct. In September of the fifteenth year of the Republic, the Regulations for Punishing Party Members Who Break Oaths were promulgated, stipulating that party members who used their authority to manipulate finances for personal gain or the benefit of others, or who embezzled treasury funds, with an amount exceeding one thousand yuan, would be sentenced to death and their property confiscated. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, the Supreme Court, in Interpretation No. 211 of the Explanation, expanded its scope of application, allowing all officials who committed bribery to be punished under that regulation. There was even advocacy for the establishment of a special court for punishing corruption, which was widely supported. Although it did not materialize, the movement to punish corruption was vigorously pursued for a time. On February 17 of the twentieth year, the Regulations for Punishing Party Members Who Break Oaths were repealed, and thereafter, ordinary criminal law was applied to bribery cases. According to the chapter on dereliction of duty in the criminal law implemented in September of the seventeenth year, the punishment for perverting the law and bribery was imprisonment for life or imprisonment for more than five years but less than an indefinite term, and a fine of up to 10,000 yuan may be imposed concurrently, further inheriting the intention of the old law to "calculate the value of the bribe to determine the crime," allowing for an increase in punishment within the scope of the benefits obtained. (Article 58 of the Criminal Law) Looking at the legislative system for punishing corruption throughout history, although not entirely the same, the spirit is consistent and has not changed.

Now is a time of great crisis, and the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Corruption have been promulgated again. From a historical perspective, this is not surprising. However, after exploring its content, there are things worthy of praise:

1.  Implementation Period: Generally speaking, the implementation period of temporary special laws and regulations is mostly limited, with little room for flexibility. The Provisional Regulations for Punishing Corruption, however, take the duration of the war as its implementation period. In other words, the period of war is the period of implementation of these regulations. The regulations will not expire as long as the war continues. This is because cleaning up corrupt officials is an essential part of completing the great cause of national construction, and cultivating integrity is a crucial task in rectifying officialdom. The objects of crime stipulated in these regulations are mostly related to the nature of wartime, such as military salaries, military engineering, military supplies, military vehicles, aircraft, horses, pack animals, etc. Therefore, taking the duration of the war as its implementation period is to facilitate the application of the law and to adapt to the needs of the environment.

2.  Scope of Subject: The subject of ordinary criminal law's dereliction of duty crimes is, in principle, limited to civil servants, excluding soldiers and those who handle public welfare affairs. The same is true for special laws throughout history. For example, the Law for Punishing Officials and Clerks Who Commit Bribery limits its actors to officials and clerks; the Regulations for Punishing Party Members Who Break Oaths limit its actors to party members and non-party members who hold official positions. The subject of crime in these regulations includes soldiers, civil servants, and those who handle public welfare affairs, which is a unique feature in the legislative history of punishing corruption.

3.  Highest System: The penalty for corruption has always been severe. In the chapter on dereliction of duty in the Provisional New Criminal Law, the highest degree of punishment for corruption was first-degree imprisonment; in the chapter on dereliction of duty in the old criminal law, the highest degree of punishment for corruption was imprisonment for more than three years but less than seven years; in the chapter on dereliction of duty in the current criminal law, the highest degree of punishment for corruption is imprisonment for life. Although the severity varies, the crime is limited to imprisonment, not death. In special laws, such as Article 2, Item 2 of the Law for Punishing Officials and Clerks Who Commit Bribery, and Articles 3 and 4 of the Regulations for Punishing Party Members Who Break Oaths, although the most severe penalty is death, the former's implementation period has long expired, and the latter has been expressly repealed for seven years, making the punishment of corruption gradually more lenient, which cannot be denied. During this period of war, if corruption recurs, the impact will be particularly detrimental. Therefore, these regulations make the death penalty the most severe penalty.

4.  Types of Crimes: According to the chapter on dereliction of duty in the criminal law, except for Article 129, Paragraph 3, which has special provisions for punishing the attempted crime of public officials illegally collecting taxes and levies and suppressing or withholding the issuance of funds or items; the remaining crimes of dereliction of duty have no clear provisions for punishing attempted crimes. As for the punishment of conspiracy to commit crimes, special provisions are only provided for the crimes of internal rebellion and foreign aggression. The punishment for preparing to commit crimes is only provided for the crimes of internal rebellion, foreign aggression, public danger, murder, robbery, extortion, etc. Conspiracy or preparation for crimes of dereliction of duty are not punishable. It seems too lenient in peacetime, but during wartime, the scope of punishing corruption must be expanded. The three types of criminal conduct: conspiracy, preparation, and failure to complete, one belongs to the internal intent of the crime, the second belongs to the act of preparing for the crime, and the third belongs to the failure to complete the execution of the crime. Although the degree of crime has not been completed, in terms of corruption crimes during wartime, it is sufficient to recognize the serious evil of the criminal. These regulations specially set up special articles and punished them together, deeply understanding the meaning of punishing evil.

5.  Confiscation of Property: The provisions on confiscation in these regulations are extremely complete in legislative system. In addition to those who have committed crimes under these regulations, the illicit money and property obtained, if publicly owned, should be recovered. If it is not publicly owned, it should be confiscated or returned to the victims according to the circumstances. If all or part of the illicit money and property cannot be recovered or confiscated, its value should be recovered. If the recovered amount cannot be paid, the property may be confiscated as a way to execute the recovery. If the value of the property is less than the amount to be recovered, necessary living expenses for the family may be left, meaning that the guilt does not extend to the wife and children. There is also a saying that, according to the interpretation of the former Supreme Court and the Judicial Yuan, the confiscated items are limited to movable property. (Refer to Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 574 and Unified Character No. 1148). However, according to an expanded interpretation of Article 38 of the Criminal Law, immovable property is also not impossible to confiscate. These regulations list both "illicit money" and "illicit property," the former specifically referring to movable property, and the latter including immovable property. Therefore, the property confiscated in accordance with these regulations should also be interpreted broadly.

6.  Jurisdictional Organ: These regulations take the duration of the war as the implementation period, and the subject of the crime includes soldiers. The objects of protection are mostly of a wartime nature, as mentioned above. Therefore, its jurisdiction should belong to military organs. Therefore, those who commit crimes under these regulations, whether soldiers, civil servants, or those who handle public welfare affairs, are all tried and executed by military organs. As for the designation of jurisdiction, it is also done by military organs.

The evolution and characteristics of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Corruption are as described above. However, how perfect the legislation is and how smooth the implementation is are not what we want to hear. It is only when there is no litigation that we can achieve no punishment. We hope that the entire nation will have a deep understanding of the implementation of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Corruption and encourage each other, "The failure of the nation is due to the evil of officials." Let us encourage each other!

Judicial Compilation

(Excerpts from the Shanghai Special Zone Branch of the Supreme Court)

Using a check to pay off old debts for goods, if the check is not cashed, it constitutes a new debt of non-performance of the negotiable instrument. According to Article 320 of the Civil Code, the old debt is not extinguished. (Hushangzi No. 24 of the 28th year of the Republic of China)

Identifying facts, selecting and adopting evidence belongs to the duties of the fact-finding court. If its identification of facts and adoption of evidence is not contrary to the law, the parties are not allowed to arbitrarily accuse it of being inappropriate. (Hushangzi No. 26 of the 28th year of the Republic of China)

Legal Questions

(Question) When an insurer goes bankrupt, except as otherwise provided in Article 79, insurance contracts are terminated one month after the declaration of bankruptcy, as specified in the first half of Article 28 of the Insurance Law. Why is the termination period of life insurance contracts different from other insurance contracts? If the insurer has declared bankruptcy, it is clear that its assets are insufficient to pay off its debts. If the contract is still valid within one month after its bankruptcy, and a risk occurs at this time, the insurer is unable to compensate, and even if the insurance amount it should receive is delivered to the creditors for equal distribution, the amount obtained is also limited. It is not the way to protect the insured or the beneficiary. What is the legislative reason? Please explain it once to enlighten my ignorance! (Xiàng Jiǒng)

(Answer) When an insurer goes bankrupt, there is indeed a question worth studying as to why the termination period of casualty insurance contracts and life insurance contracts is different. When I was drafting the amended Insurance Law, I also paid attention to this and thought about amending it. Because this clause was adopted from French law, I thought there must be a special reason, so I did not dare to move it without authorization. However, during the first reading at the Legislative Yuan, I explained the reasons for wanting to amend it to the public, hoping to modify it in the review committee. In the end, due to various reasons, the original text was maintained and not changed. This is the original reason for amending Articles 28 and 79 of the Insurance Law, and its legislative reason really needs to be studied.

As far as I can see, life insurance contracts are often established for a longer period, and the calculation of insurance premiums depends on the size of the age. Once the contract is established, the insurance premium that the insured should pay each year is fixed and will not change. Therefore, the annual insurance premium for a life insurance contract established at the age of forty is lower than the life insurance premium established at the age of forty-one. Therefore, if a life insurance contract is terminated for any reason after it is established, and then a contract is established with another insurer, the conditions of the contract cannot be the same as the previous contract. Even if it is for the protection of the policyholder, stipulating that the termination period of his contract will be extended by one month when the insurer goes bankrupt, the same as for the loss insurance contract, it will still not allow the policyholder to establish a life insurance contract with the same conditions with another insurer, and it will still be of no help. It is better to terminate it when the insurer goes bankrupt. As for the loss insurance contract, the period is usually one year. For the protection of the insured, the legislator stipulates a one-month delay in termination, so that the policyholder can re-establish an insurance contract with the same conditions with other insurers, so as not to suffer losses in the short period of time after the immediate termination. This may also be the main reason for the legislation of the two articles, because the insurer's debts are not only one type of compensation liability, but there are other arrears such as property mortgages, etc. The law stipulates that the termination period of the loss insurance contract should be delayed by one month, which is also to protect the interests of the insured. (Wáng Xiàowén)

(Question) A rents a part of his surplus house to B. Last year, when A intended to take it back for his own use due to an increase in population, B requested mediation from the Residential Problems Mediation Committee. As a result, B agreed to vacate the house by the end of April of this year. Both parties wrote mediation documents and held them as evidence. A sent a letter at the end of March to inform B of his performance, but B is still overdue and refuses to vacate. (1) Can Party A immediately request the court to execute it? (2) If it is necessary to first file a lawsuit for judgment, can a request be made to allow provisional execution? (3) Is it necessary to provide a guarantee when requesting provisional execution? (4) Can A request B to compensate for the losses caused by the delay (according to which articles of the Civil Code)? (Yáng Xiāngbō) (1) No. (2) Yes. (3) According to the law, the court should declare provisional execution ex officio, without the need for a guarantee. (4) Yes. (According to Article 231 of the Civil Code) (Ditto)

(Question) (1) A and B are both women, each with a husband, and although the two hosts are friendly, there is no improper relationship. If B's husband finds out, is A committing a crime? (2) Is A committing a crime if he gives something to B? (3) If A and B want to live together, what are the procedures? (4) If B commits suicide due to unrequited love, what crime does A commit? (5) B marries her husband without a certificate. If her husband later finds out about B's love affair with A, does he have the right to not care? (Chén Qí)

(Answer) (1) Since A and B did not have illicit intercourse, they should not be guilty. (2) Giving gifts is not a criminal act. (3) A is already married? B is also already married. If they live together, they will violate the crime in Article 239 of the Criminal Law. (4) If A has incited or assisted suicide, he should be held liable for the crime in Article 275 of the Criminal Law. (5) A marriage certificate is not a necessary form for marriage. If B and her husband have indeed married, then the husband is not without the right to care about her relationship while the left marital relationship continues. (Huáng)

(Question) After B's death, his younger brother C seduced B's wife A and gave birth to a son D. Because C has a wife, he abandoned A and D, mother and son. (1) Can A and C freely break away from the relationship? (2) Is it legal for D to be raised by A? (3) What procedures and results are there when D comes of age? (Yóu Gùshì)

(Answer) (1) Yes. (2) Legal. (3) None. (Wú Guāngdǐng)

(Answer) (Mǎi Xiānshēng) The question has been assigned to the "Legal Questions" column of the second issue of this publication on the eighth of this month (May). (Yi)

Brief Comments

### Fùzhài Zǐ Huán (Father's Debts Repaid by Son)

— (Wúyòng) (Useless)

"Father's debts repaid by son" has been generally recognized by society for thousands of years. However, the accompanying laws, fearing that the violence would lead to self-abandonment and the lack of talent, have provisions for "limited inheritance" and "abandonment of inheritance rights." Those who abandon the inheritance do not care about the parents' assets and liabilities, and those who limit the inheritance are not responsible for the parents' debts when the parents' estate is not enough to pay off the debts.

### An Easy and Simple Task

— Gang Ni

Cigarette cards are popular among the general lower-class laborers and children with limited knowledge, so they bear the responsibility of educating the public. Their influence is significant, especially in this great era when the motherland and the nation are facing life and death, and we are in such adversity...

Recently, there is a cigarette called "Great Anchor Brand" on the market. Its cigarette cards depict miserable scenes of refugee areas, and the back is printed with "Refugee Song." Refugee Song (4) goes like this:

——Arriving in a bustling city,

Hoping to find a place to rely on;

Who knew that the land is inhospitable, and poverty is hard to cure,

Begging on the streets,

Suffering from cold and lack of clothing,

Where is home after the country is lost?

Such material is taken from the bloody reality and the familiar environment around us. Moreover, the form of the text is in the "song" style, which is easy to understand. Some are the "living spoken language" of the public, so they are closer to the public and suitable for the public's taste. It is very meaningful and worth promoting and emulating.

But we are by no means saying that the material for cigarette cards must be taken from the reality of this era and environment. Historical stories (such as the Biography of Yue Fei and Mulan Joining the Army, which are rich in national consciousness and educational significance) are equally valuable.

In short, we sincerely hope that domestic cigarette companies can more practically shoulder this responsibility—the responsibility of educating the public. This is an easy and simple task, but its impact and significance are so great!

### Tapping Little Hammers

— Zhu Yan

—A Typist's Life Record—

The first important thing to do when arriving at the office in the morning is to carefully uncover the cover on the typewriter. Every time I stroke the typewriter, my means of livelihood for the past ten years, I can't help but feel sad.

Every morning from nine o'clock to twelve o'clock, and in the afternoon from one o'clock to five o'clock, my ten fingers "tap, tap" on the typewriter without stopping. Some say that the typewriter is a machine, and the typist is just a machine of the machine. All day long, official documents, letters, invoices, receipts, piles of them several inches high in the wire basket, one batch after another, barely giving you a chance to breathe. Sometimes you have to line up ten or twenty sheets of carbon paper. If you don't use enough force, the printing won't be clear, so you have to hit it hard, often causing the flesh on your fingers to separate from the nails, creating wounds that open like mouths, causing pain that pierces your heart. Sometimes you have to use a thirty-two-key typewriter, which is so big and heavy that you almost break your fingers. Sometimes you also have to use blue-green carbon ribbon, making your hands look like you work in a dye shop, and you can't wash them clean. Our manager, although he has never been abroad or gotten any fancy education, adopts some Westernized methods in managing his subordinates, especially for typists. He is particularly meticulous in managing whether the posture is correct—back straight? Is the sound of typing fast and rhythmic? If you want to slack off, light a cigarette, and take a break, you will immediately be "eating big dishes" (getting punished), so after leaving the office every day, I always feel pain in my waist and fingers, dizziness, and blurred vision. But what can I do in order to be driven by the whip of life?

Hard work, hard work, the end of the month arrives, and it's time to collect the salary. Everyone's withered faces are covered with a trace of a smile, but the price of a month's hard work is thirty yuan in legal tender. Fifteen yuan for a month's rent in a small attic has already taken up half of it (and that's a bargain, the sub-landlord is thinking of ways to increase the rent!). Recently, the price of rice has skyrocketed again, with second-grade rice selling for more than sixteen yuan per picul. Firewood, charcoal briquettes, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar are all more expensive than before. How can that fifteen yuan support a family of several people? My wife's belly is getting bigger day by day, and the delivery date is just around the corner. I don't know where the delivery expenses will come from. The children's shoes are torn every day, and their socks are torn, and it's time to get them new ones. As for my worn-out, shiny gown, I'll just make do with it. I remember that next Saturday is the happy wedding of the director's daughter, and those two yuan can't be saved. Next Sunday is the 60th birthday of the manager's mother. This gift cannot be missed either. Thinking of this, I felt a burst of darkness in front of me, and even swallowed the "sigh" and couldn't breathe it out.

Typists are commonly known as "little hammer敲小榔頭" workers, probably a self-deprecating term.

### This Year's Loquats

— Xu Zhen

Inland transportation involves heavy donations and taxes along the way, and there are many inferior goods, making it difficult for vendors to make money.

The cries of yellow hot plums fill the streets and alleys, and at this time, you can see the loquats with their mixed fur and wearing yellow and red robes.

Loquats are not considered a valuable fruit in Jiangnan. In the early summer and late spring, this thing appears on the streets, and the price is not very expensive. But when it first comes on the market, it is so sour that it is unbearable. Because it is a seasonal fruit, it is used as an embellishment on banquets.

But these days, Shanghai's loquats have reached their peak, filling the streets and alleys, but there are very few loquats coming.

The wholesale market for loquats in Shanghai, like fresh fish and fruits, is in the Sixteenth Settlement. At this time, other fruits cannot be temporarily connected, and loquats are used as a major business in the general fruit shops in the Sixteenth Settlement.

As long as you go to the Sixteenth Settlement, you can see small baskets of loquats placed in front of every store and vendor stall, covered with a red advertising paper, and a piece of wood with the words "Tangqi Big Red Robe" for 65 cents per basket, and "Dongting Mountain White Sand Soft Carving" for 75 cents per basket.

The so-called "Big Red Robe" is a loquat with red skin and red flesh. This kind of loquat comes from Tangqi and is cheap. Although some are sweet, many are sour. If you are not careful, you can only admit bad luck.

The so-called "White Sand Soft Carving" is the best and sweetest loquat in the middle. It is not very big when it is born, but it is very solid, has a lot of water, the flesh is white, and the taste is extremely sweet. This kind of loquat comes from Dongting Mountain in Suzhou. The highest price is 80 cents per basket (about fifty or sixty), and the cheapest price is more than 60 cents.

I talked to some fruit shops in the Sixteenth Settlement about the market conditions for loquats this year. He said that this year's loquat profit is very light, and the days of business are also very short.

It is said that there are not as many loquats this year as in previous years. On the one hand, the donations and taxes along the cards are too heavy. A boat of loquats often has to donate 20 yuan. If it passes through other cards, it will have to donate as well.

They sent people to the mountains of Suzhou to purchase loquats. In the past, they used to take the land route and take the train, and they would be quickly delivered to the mouths of Shanghai people in two days. But now it is not possible. A boat of loquats has to take the waterway, from Suzhou to Jiaxing, and then to Shanghai. Its waterway journey takes at least eight days. Some loquats that are a little greener can withstand the delay, but some loquats that are riper will rot as soon as they arrive in Shanghai.

"Business is not comparable to before!" said a fruit shop owner with anxiety.

They transport the loquats to Shanghai and then wholesale them to fruit stores and vendors. The best common red sand loquats sell for 4 yuan for ten, and the best white sand loquats sell for 6 yuan per ten.

It is said that the loquat season this year is very short. It will probably be sold until the end of the month, and loquats will not be seen on the market.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Twelve: Red Powder Eliminates Enmity but Fails to Dissipate Sin, Green Window Discusses Love and Remakes a Good Relationship

Zhao Letian was hospitalized for a long time, and a one-legged person could no longer go to the front line. At that time, he was truly unburdened and the shadow of Pan Peiying gradually faded away. However, the letters Zhao Letian sent to Pan Peiying could never reach her boudoir. All of them were intercepted by her father. Naturally, Pan Peiying could not obtain freedom and was secretly monitored by her father, Pan Xinxin. He knew that this reply to Zhao Letian was forced to write, not out of her own will. To guard against the future that she would write another letter to Zhao Letian, denying that the reply that day was not out of her own intentions. But at that time, her actions had lost freedom and she was monitored everywhere. Even if she wanted to send a letter, it had to go through her father's hands. Peiying initially had this intention. After writing that forced reply, she hurriedly thought of writing another letter to cancel the previous one. Who knew that her father's surveillance was so tight that she didn't even have the chance to write a letter. Moreover, the previous letter did not give her Zhao Letian's address. The whole letter was sent out by her father, Pan Xinxin, without any relaxation. Later, Zhao Letian sent two more letters to Peiying, which were all intercepted and viewed by her father. The first soil (letter) was actually prepared for Peiying, and he verbally abused her father. At this time, her father had already developed an old face. He just laughed and locked the letter in his desk drawer. The so-called "Let him laugh and scold, I will do my own good office," the ancients had already described it perfectly. "I am always cleaner than you!" Her father thought after reading it: "You die, you die in vain, not like us dying, at least we can receive tens of thousands of dollars in pension in the puppet government? But if you really die, we will have some benefits. Because Peiying's father, although he forced his daughter to write a reply yesterday, refusing Zhao Letian, knew that this matter was forced. His daughter still loved this young man. All the expressions and words showed it. Why did he want to monitor her so closely? It was just because he was afraid that if there was any slack, they would still communicate, or even have an agreement to meet and flee together! Just look at her frowning brows and long sighs every day, and she can't arouse her interest in anything! If he really died, Zhao Letian's body died, but Pan Peiying's heart did not die. At that time, or when giving her a match, there are also many beautiful men in the puppet government, or to use this to contact people in high positions, she will not firmly reject my father's New proposal."

### "Secret Service of the Air"

— Qi Hua

“Secret Service of the Air”

Produced by Warner Bros. Shown at the Grand Light Theatre

The story of "Secret Service of the Air" is a copy of "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang" plus "G-Men."

"Gangster Hanlik is the ringleader of a group illegally smuggling people into the country," which is the same as George Aynes and his partners in crime in "G-Men," running a tight transportation company, except that the former is illegally smuggling people into the country and the latter is escorting criminals out of the country. The special agent who investigates this illegal smuggling of people into the country, Boss, "deliberately goes to jail for illegally smuggling counterfeit money, so that he can get close to Hanlik and find out the secrets," which is the same as the journalist in "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang," who deliberately commits a crime to go to jail in order to collect evidence.

"G-Men" and "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang" are the only two examples I can remember, but there are many more stories like this.

"Secret Service of the Air" created a gangster Hanlik who trafficked people, and a special agent Boss who stood in opposition to him. Then Boss won the trust of Hanlik's party member Jim, and then revealed his true colors. At this critical moment, he finally turned danger into safety and wiped out all the party members in one fell swoop. The special agent established great merit, which is also a cliché.

This exposes the ferocity of the gangsters and the shrewdness of the special agents. Perhaps this contrast is the original intention of repeatedly making similar movies? However, because it is necessary to emphasize the wisdom and courage of the special agents, the various wrongdoings of the gangsters are used to set them off. After James Cagney's "The Public Enemy" was banned in Shanghai, I felt that the objective effect after the release of this type of film may be counterproductive. Even from a "business perspective," the dogfights in the planes and the model planes flying in the sky are not new or exciting after seeing them repeatedly.
