### Spokesperson of the Chinese Army Discusses the Reasons for the Quiet Front Lines

Insufficient Strength of the Japanese Armies on All Routes; Tokyo Unable to Send Reinforcements

Chongqing: A spokesperson of the Chinese military acknowledged to the press that there were only two thousand Japanese troops on Weizhou Island near Beihai in northern Guangdong, and there were still twenty Japanese warships near Weizhou Island. The military strength of the Japanese army in South China is insufficient to attempt a landing in Beihai. The Japanese army around Guangzhou numbers four or five divisions. There are two Japanese divisions in Guangzhou city, and one Japanese division in Sanshui. The remaining Japanese troops are distributed in various places to respond to the guerrillas. Because the Chinese guerrillas are constantly counterattacking to disrupt the Japanese army. There are nine Japanese divisions in the Wuhan area, and three Japanese divisions west and northwest of Hankou, specializing in dealing with the continued counterattacks of the Chinese guerrilla forces. There is only one Japanese division north of the Yangtze River north of Hankou, preparing for the Chinese army's counterattack from the northeast of Hubei and the southwest of Anhui. There is one Japanese division in each of De'an and Yuezhou, and two Japanese divisions between De'an and Yuezhou. Because the Chinese guerrillas are constantly disrupting them, the Japanese have not withdrawn their troops from central China. The Japanese army in Shanxi is also insufficient to do anything. After the initial decision of the Japanese army between the Yellow River and the Fen River in southwestern Shanxi failed, all the cities in that area have been recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in southwestern Shanxi is now attacking the Zhongtiao Mountains along the Tongpu Railway, but there has been no progress, and on the contrary, they have suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese army in China once asked Tokyo to send four more divisions of reinforcements, but Tokyo was unable to send reinforcements to China, so the front lines in South China and North China have been very quiet recently.

At about 1:00 PM on the 31st, the Japanese army in Qiujin on the north bank again shelled the Tong'anling area on the south bank of the Chinese side, but this is equivalent to the daily routine of the Xiu River battlefield. The Chinese side suffered no losses and did not retaliate, but every night the Chinese army has small units crossing the river to disrupt the enemy. (Dispatch, 31st)

### Bloody Battle in Sanshui Area, Recovering Le'gang and Zao'gang

Sihui: On the 31st, the Japanese army in Sanshui crossed the river to invade the west and launched a bloody battle with the Chinese army in the area near the old Sanshui. The Japanese army was extremely fierce, but it could not withstand the heavy blows of the Chinese army and collapsed in a panic. That morning, the Japanese army set up twenty steel cannons in Mumianxu, densely bombarding Le'gang and Zao'gang across the river, firing more than twenty rounds per minute, continuously for half an hour. Then, more than 600 Japanese soldiers were dispatched to forcibly cross the river under the cover of fierce artillery fire, landing at the estuary southeast of the old Sanshui and advancing towards Chinese Le'gang and Zao'gang. The Chinese alert troops immediately met the enemy. However, the Japanese were numerous and the Chinese were few, so they changed to defend the lines of [illegible]. The Japanese continued to attack, and the Chinese army fought bravely. Until noon, the Japanese firepower gradually weakened, and four Japanese aircraft came to attack, circling over the Chinese positions to scout and then dropping bombs to assist in the battle. The Chinese army stood firm and remained steadfast in its defense. The Japanese army could not advance any further. The two sides were deadlocked until dawn this morning, when the Chinese army launched a counterattack under the moonlight. The Japanese army was caught off guard and retreated in a panic, taking advantage of the victory to pursue and kill, and completely recovered Le'gang, Zao'gang and other places. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than a hundred casualties of officers and soldiers, and suffered heavy losses. The Chinese tax police team leader fought bravely and died in battle, and dozens of soldiers were killed and wounded. This morning, more than 300 Japanese soldiers, attached with several artillery pieces, fled from Sanshui to Langgang and shelled Mafang. The Chinese defenders were closely monitoring. By 4:00 PM, most of the Japanese had retreated to Sanshui, leaving only a few on guard. (Dispatch, 1st)

### Editorial: The Movement to Rescue Wounded Soldiers

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Shanghai, due to its special location, accommodated many wounded soldiers in various hospitals during the early stages of the war. At that time, the general public paid close attention to the care, comfort, and emergency relief of wounded soldiers. However, after the war moved away from Shanghai, Shanghai became merely a refuge area for refugees. As a result, refugee relief became a major issue in Shanghai society. Even now, with only a small number of refugees remaining, generous philanthropists from China and abroad are still loudly appealing for donations to provide relief. However, news about the relief of wounded soldiers has not been heard for a long time. In fact, the seriousness of the wounded soldier relief issue, compared to the relief of a small number of refugees in Shanghai, is actually even more important. Because the war zone is expanding and the war is prolonged, the number of wounded soldiers will only increase day by day. The cost of medical care and supplies needed by these brave men who are wounded for the country is enormous! On the government side, of course, there are also considerable funds available, but to seek thorough relief, and to quickly alleviate the suffering of countless wounded soldiers struggling in flesh and blood, it is necessary for the wealthy people of the whole country to work hard to expand the relief movement. Shanghai, at present, is naturally still the leading wealth concentration area in China, so launching this movement by Shanghai society will certainly have a considerable and huge effect.

We must know the motivation for relieving refugees does not entirely stem from a humanitarian standpoint; moreover, during the course of the war, relieving wounded soldiers with combat capabilities has a far-reaching impact on the future of the war of resistance! Wounded soldiers, in terms of military skills and courage, are generally far superior to new recruits. If they can be quickly treated, recover from their injuries, and return to their units, their effectiveness will naturally be far greater than recruiting new troops to replenish the ranks. This is a direct way to strengthen China's ability to resist Japan. Now, because the facilities for rescuing wounded soldiers in the war zone are incomplete, many unnecessary sacrifices are often encountered. If the rescue facilities can be improved, it can avoid wounded soldiers rolling in ditches and wandering on the roads, countless heartbreaking and tragic tragedies, which is also a way to indirectly preserve the strength of the war of resistance.

However, the necessity of the wounded soldier relief movement is known to all; what is lacking now is an organized effort to carry it out. We often see in Shanghai newspapers foreign news reporters' war zone dispatches, emphasizing the pain of Chinese wounded soldiers in the war zone and the urgent need for relief, and saying that many wounded soldiers could have been saved, but they died because medical treatment was too late, and even saying that wealthy people who do not donate money to rescue these enthusiastic, patriotic, and injured heroes are committing a crime. Are there not many wealthy merchants and magnates in Shanghai? And since the outbreak of the war, due to the increase in the population seeking refuge, there are also quite a few people who have made fortunes from the national crisis. In recent years, there have been many industrial and commercial firms that have made a lot of wartime profits, including the textile industry and others in the concession areas. There are certainly no lack of patriots among them, who should take the lead in donating large amounts of money to the national fund for rescuing wounded soldiers; and various public legal bodies should also uphold their usual enthusiasm for relieving refugees to support the implementation of this new movement. Why hasn't anyone initiated this important movement yet?

Moreover, those who have money should immediately donate money, and those who have strength should also contribute their strength. The most powerful people to rescue wounded soldiers are, of course, medical and nursing talents. Now, medical rescue personnel from the League of Nations, as well as foreigners from India, the Philippines, and other places, are still voluntarily participating in Chinese battlefield service. We have also seen recently that the wife of the Czech Minister of Health almost died in an effort to manufacture and donate cholera vaccine for Chinese wounded soldiers. How can we not feel ashamed to death! Is it possible that Chinese people love their own country less than foreigners love China? No! No! We believe that as long as someone initiates this wounded soldier relief movement, many enthusiastic people in Shanghai's famous medical organizations, such as the Chinese Medical Association, will certainly not let foreign medical professionals monopolize the limelight, and some will also go to the battlefield to serve and do their best for the country. As for the large amount of medical supplies needed, the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association will also solicit donations from its members. Even overseas Chinese can collect suitable medical supplies, taking advantage of the convenience of their locations. For example, quinine is in great demand on the Chinese battlefield, and in the past, it could only be bought at high prices in Hong Kong and Shanghai, but the Dutch East Indies, where many overseas Chinese are located, produce the most. Wouldn't it be convenient and appropriate to donate it wholesale?

However, in the entire wounded soldier relief movement, "giving money" is still more important than "giving strength," because with money, you can control manpower. Medical facilities can be purchased and completed accordingly, and even the wounded soldiers' nutrition and sanitation can be properly arranged. Let's see what large-scale measures the enthusiastic and patriotic people of Shanghai society will use to promote this most important "wounded soldier relief movement" at present?

### Wu Peifu Refuses to Take Up a Puppet Post

Not Subject to Any Threats or Inducements

The People of Tianjin and Beijing are Greatly Relieved to Hear This

Hong Kong: Tianjin News: Japan's attempts to induce Wu Peifu to take up a puppet post have been very fierce. A few days ago, it instigated ruffians in Tianjin and Beijing to send telegrams in support of Wu, and spread rumors that Wu had accepted a certain puppet post, and arranged for more than 130 Chinese and foreign reporters to meet with Wu on the 30th. Beforehand, the Japanese special service agency prepared a draft of the conversation to be released on the spot. Unexpectedly, the content of Wu's conversation during the meeting was completely contrary to the Japanese-prepared original draft. Wu not only did not express his intention to accept, but also put forward three conditions, saying that true peace could not be achieved without these conditions. The foreign reporters were all astonished, and the supervising personnel also changed color. They immediately ordered the inspection agency to withhold the foreign reporters' telegrams, and at the same time copied and issued the Japanese-prepared conversation through the Domei News Agency in an attempt to cover up the situation. Wu's attitude is very firm, and he disregards any threats or inducements. The people of Tianjin and Beijing are greatly relieved to hear this. (Dispatch, 1st)

Beijing: Wu Peifu, whom the Japanese are eager to confer a puppet post on, met with foreign reporters in his private residence today, under the strict protection of Chinese and Japanese guards, but did not specify his position, only stating the benefits of peace, and said that he had received requests from Chinese and Japanese friends to come forward and lead the peace movement, but to make peace a success, he must have the strength and the ability to promote peace. Judging from the slightly dissatisfied reaction of various Japanese circles to Wu's words, Wu has not yet been induced by the Japanese. According to reliable sources, Wu's demands include: organizing a strong Chinese army, completely under Wu's command; returning real power in China to the hands of the Chinese people. Judging from the translation of Wu's statements, it does contain the second proposal. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

Beijing: Wu Peifu, a Chinese Confucian general, issued a statement to 150 newspaper reporters here today, stating that he himself has not accepted any new position, nor is he prepared to come out and accept any new position. Wu first said, "Foreigners say that because I love peace, some people want me to come out and lead the peace movement. My friends also encourage me to come out of the mountains. However, I want to lead to true peace, and three prerequisites must be fulfilled first. We must have real military force, we must have real political power, and a suitable location. As for the location, of course Beijing is the best. I may be slightly popular in Beijing. The problem is whether I have real political power. I have heard rumors that the Japanese military is willing to return real political power to the Chinese people. I also believe that peace will be difficult to achieve unless Japan does this." Judging from this oral statement of Wu, it can be seen that the saying in the Chinese and foreign newspapers in recent days that Wu Peifu has actively participated in the so-called "peace" movement is actually just a one-sided wish of a certain party. (Associated Press dispatch, 31st)

Beijing: Wu Peifu said to newspaper reporters today that his actions have always been aimed at peace, and at the same time, he showed the reporters the texts of ancient Chinese philosophical works that he had collected in Sichuan to oppose communism, as well as his own anti-communist poems written yesterday, and said that if you read them, you will know that communism is not suitable for China's national conditions. Also, there were some differences between the record of Wu's conversation and the Japanese English translation, because Wu went back into the inner room after talking to the newspaper reporters and did not answer any questions. But later he suddenly handed over a written statement, which vaguely stated, "I intend to save the country from collapse, and it is indeed time to seek permanent peace. Some people want me to take on the important task of appeasement. I am old and weak, and I am afraid I cannot bear it. However, since I am a citizen, it is my duty to strive for peace, so I will only do my duty in the future, so as not to disappoint the people of the country. I believe that if the Provisional Government and the Reformed Government can cooperate with each other, and at the same time, can gain the good sympathy of the Japanese government and its military, then peace can be gradually achieved." However, as far as the Associated Press knows, this statement was actually drafted by a group of pseudo-officials who persuaded Wu to come out, because Wu at the time stated that he would not issue a written statement, but only made an oral statement. Therefore, it is impossible for Wu's side to verify whether this written statement was actually issued by Wu himself. Also, when reporters, including foreign reporters, visited Wu, they were severely searched by Japanese and puppet military police. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)

### New China Daily Praises the Fifth Plenary Session

An Important Conference of Historical Significance: Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Will Continue to Advance

Chongqing - Today's Communist Party organ, the New China Daily, published a commentary praising the resolutions of the Kuomintang Fifth Plenary Session. It stated that the Kuomintang Fifth Plenary Session and the Communist Party's Sixth Enlarged Conference echoed each other, promoting unity and continued resistance against Japan in the same spirit. The newspaper stated, "Under the principle of intensifying unity, no matter what practical ways the two parties cooperate, we believe that the cooperation between the two parties will continue to progress based on the current relationship between the two parties.

Japanese Side Monopolizes Hankou Water and Electricity Businesses

Hankou - The contract signed on January 28th between the "Hankou Branch of Central China Water and Electricity Company" and Mr. Duberry, Director of Special District Three (i.e., the former British Concession), can be regarded as the first concrete manifestation of Japan's formal recognition of the Chen Youren-O'Malley Agreement, and proves that the Chinese Water and Electricity Company has been merged by the Japanese Electrical Monopoly. It is reported that the Japanese side did not force Special District Three to sign this agreement, but instead proposed a method by which the Japanese side directly collects water fees from the residents of Special District Three. If this is the case, then the Chen-O'Malley Agreement is tantamount to being invalidated. It is said that the contract does not stipulate that the price rate should be calculated according to the user as determined by the company, but only that the quantity consumed by Japanese military and civilians in the area should be deducted from the total amount supplied to the area. The contract period is six months, and either party can cancel it with one month's notice. It is reported that the British Consul-General has notified the Japanese Consul-General, declaring that the British government reserves its rights under the Chen-O'Malley Agreement. The current water price has increased by 55% compared to before. In addition, by changing Chinese legal tender to Japanese gold, the Japanese side has actually doubled the water price. The newly stipulated water price is one Japanese gold yuan per thousand gallons. Special District One and Jardine Matheson Properties are also supplied with electricity by the company.

Xi'an - Military news: Guo Shoushan, a sergeant of the Fifth Company of the Second Battalion of the Ninth Regiment of the China Guerrilla Force, was 23 years old and a native of Wayaocun Village, Zhaocheng. In the autumn of last year, he and his younger brother Guo Shouhai joined the Dare-to-Die Corps due to resentment of Japanese oppression. His bravery and patriotism were admired by the entire battalion. In December of last year, he was assigned to reconnoiter the Japanese situation in the city. He took the opportunity to be introduced by his father and voluntarily entered the traitor school to conduct secret work. He and his father, Guo Junjie, who assisted him in his work, were quickly arrested by the Japanese army. After interrogation and torture by the Japanese army, the two men were bruised and battered, but they firmly refused to reveal the truth about the Chinese army and scolded them severely. Under shame and anger, the Japanese army even used iron hammers to knock out their teeth one by one. Guo Shoushan's hair was completely pulled out. On the morning of December 13, Guo Shoushan and his father, Guo Junjie, were brutally murdered by the Japanese army next to the Dongyue Temple outside the East Gate of Zhaocheng. When they were executed, both father and son shouted "Down with Japanese Imperialism! Long live the Liberation of the Republic of China!"

Arita also said that the government should not pay compensation for losses suffered by third countries in the Chinese theater of war, as this compensation should be paid by the Chiang Kai-shek regime.

### One of the Most Exciting Scenes of the Japanese Diet's Interrogation on the War

The Prolongation of the War and Unfavorable International Situation, Domestic Anxiety Clearly Visible

Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch: The interrogation on the war at the Budget General Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 31st was quite sharp. First, Bei Lingji, formerly affiliated with the Orient Association and now affiliated with the Civil Administration Party, asked, "China is friendly with Britain and the United States and hostile to Japan. Is it not because of defects in Japan's diplomatic measures?" Arita was quite embarrassed, but replied, "The fact that Sino-Japanese relations cannot be adjusted and that this decision has become increasingly profound is due to very complex reasons." Bei asked, "Does the cabinet intend to take resolute measures against the British and American policy?" Arita replied, "The Konoe statement has already indicated the goal, and now is not the time to take resolute measures." From this, it can be seen that the diplomatic line taken by Arita is still the old line of Hirota. The reason why he does not take resolute measures is not that he does not want to, but that he cannot. Sato, a member of the Seiyukai, asked, "What is the meaning of Konoe's statement that he does not want to demand compensation?" Arita replied, "The losses of the country can certainly not demand compensation, but the losses of individuals cannot but demand compensation." Bei also asked, "How much is the amount of compensation?" Arita replied, "The exact amount has not yet been calculated." From this question and answer, it can be known that Konoe's statement that he would not demand compensation is actually a deceptive statement. Compensating for personal losses is a disguised form of compensation. Arita has revealed it all. Xiaochu, a member of the Civil Administration Party, asked about the relationship between Japan and the National Government. The questions and answers from both sides were all old stories and had no meaning. Xiaochu then turned to question the foreign exchange policy, saying, "Why does Japan still insist on the exchange rate of one shilling and two pence against the pound?" Ishiwatari replied, "The current exchange rate is very proper and beneficial, and there is no need to change it." Since the start of the war, the price of Japanese foreign exchange has fluctuated. Because its government would rather suffer losses than give up the exchange rate of one shilling and two pence, foreign exchange can still be maintained with difficulty. Recently, some financiers in the country have advocated lowering the legal exchange rate, but its authorities are maintaining the old rate in order to avoid a collapse in foreign exchange. This question and answer can make it clear. Xiaoshan also raised an important question, saying that in order for Japan to make its true intentions clear to all countries, it should convene an international conference in Tokyo, inviting Britain and the United States, and if necessary, also inviting Germany and Italy to jointly discuss the East Asian issue. This proposal has its own deep meaning, and seems to want to seek an end to the Sino-Japanese war through an international conference. Hiranuma replied, "There is a need to explain Japan's true intentions, but there are no plans to convene an international conference at this time." Hiranuma's answer was very suggestive, and seemed to be mostly supportive. Arita replied, "It is also doubtful whether convening this international conference can make the third country understand. It is more effective to have a cordial meeting with the representatives of the countries concerned stationed in Japan." However, Xiaoshan expressed deep dissatisfaction with the replies of Hiranuma and Arita, and still advocated convening an international conference as soon as possible. Finally, Arita replied, "Japan's determination has been repeatedly expressed to the outside world and there is no need to convene a meeting again." Xiaoshan also asked, "Last year, Japan asked the French ambassador to China to submit four principles for resolving the incident to China. I don't know if the current cabinet is still considering them." Arita replied, "The current bald cabinet continues to implement the Konoe cabinet's China policy." The debate then came to an end. This section was one of the most exciting scenes of the 31st. The domestic concern about the international situation and the anxiety caused by the prolongation of the war are clearly visible. (Dispatch on the 1st)

Tokyo - When the House of Representatives debated the budget案 this morning, the main events discussed included strengthening the participation of political parties in the cabinet, a proposal to convene a conference of overseas Japanese in Tokyo, the difference between the policies of the former and current Army and Foreign Ministers on the China Incident, the compensation that can be demanded from China, and the benefits of third countries in China, etc. Seiji from the Seiyukai took the floor first, saying that Prime Minister Hiranuma had guaranteed to respect political parties and asked to quickly grant more positions in the cabinet to party members, so as to realize the policy of national unity to serve the emperor. The Prime Minister replied that the whole country is always loyal to the emperor under the constitutional government, and the size of its activities does not depend on the number of positions. When he formed the cabinet, he implemented the policy of talent without distinguishing between parties. Segoe then proposed convening a conference of overseas Japanese representatives in Tokyo to show Japan's policy on the China Incident. The Prime Minister replied that he was unable to give a definite answer to this proposal at this time. Segoe continued to explain that the opinions of the former and current Army and Foreign Ministers regarding the compensation that can be demanded from China were quite different, and Japan's policy on the China Incident has changed every time the cabinet is changed, so that the outside world has the impression that Japan has no fixed policy. He also asked, "The losses caused by Japan's military operations in China will not be compensated. What kind of answer did General Chiang Kai-shek give to the four points for resolving the China Incident proposed by the former Foreign Minister Hirota?" Foreign Minister Arita replied, "I do not know the details of the conditions submitted to the Chiang Kai-shek government by the former German ambassador. As for Japan's policy on the China Incident, it is unchangeable. Prime Minister Konoe has stated this in his declaration on December 22. Konoe's declaration is slightly different from the previous declarations issued by the government, but this is due to changes in the situation. Konoe's declaration is still valid today, and the government's policy has not changed since December 22." The Foreign Minister also revealed that the government's policy is that foreigners will not be compensated for the losses they suffered due to Japan's military operations in China. Fan Gu then criticized the government's secret policies after the outbreak of the China Incident, and urged the government to recognize the rights and interests enjoyed by third countries in China who hinder Japan's just cause and assist the Chiang Kai-shek government. In his reply, the Foreign Minister reiterated the policy of respecting the interests of third countries in China as much as possible. Then, Army Minister Itagaki stated that the government is confident in its ability to maintain peace and order in China in the future, and said that the situation in North China has greatly improved as a result of the efforts of the Japanese expeditionary force.

### The United States Decides to Take Various Steps to Actively Aid Civilized Countries

To Confront European Dictatorships: America's First Line of Defense is in France

New York - Today's newspapers carried shocking news about President Roosevelt's meeting with the Senate Military Affairs Committee yesterday. The New York Times stated that after the members left the meeting, they all had the impression that the US President would take all possible steps except war to safeguard the civilized countries of Europe and confront the dictatorships. It is reported that the US President asked the members to regard France as the actual border of the Americas in the inevitable conflict between the civilized countries and the dictatorships. The New York Daily News recorded roughly the same, also mentioning the US President's remarks about the border between the American and European continents during the war, and said that the President had a concrete understanding that there was active support between the United States and the civilized countries of Europe. The leading leaders of the civilized countries of Europe all know the position of the US President, etc. It is also said that the US President's convocation of the Senate Military Affairs Committee is a first in nearly 25 years. The reason for this move is to explain the reason why he allowed American aircraft manufacturers to sell new-style aircraft to France. After hearing the President's words, the members left in silence. It is reported that the President said that he did not expect to see a day when American troops would go abroad to fight again, but he felt that the United States must do what it can to preserve Britain and France. The New York Daily News also said that several senators felt that it was not appropriate to hide anything from the American people at this time, but because they swore to keep secrets, they were quite unhappy. A member said that the President's opinion on the world situation was truly shocking, but the President thought that the situation he observed was extremely serious, and he was afraid that the American people would be shocked by it, so he advised the members to keep the secret and not reveal what he said to the outside world. Last night, some members ignored their words and directly published them in the newspapers, saying that President Roosevelt had stated that the United States selling aircraft to France was in line with American foreign policy, because aiding civilized countries was one of the general purposes of American foreign policy. The President also stated that since he is the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, he has the right to allow the sale of aircraft and is fully responsible, so the Military Affairs Committee should not continue its investigation into the sale of aircraft to France. Furthermore, the US government has encouraged foreign governments to purchase aircraft from the United States in the past two years. As for how to encourage it, and whether this encouragement is applied to all relevant foreign governments, the President did not elaborate. According to the United Press, Senator King has repeatedly criticized the government, but is now one of the supporters of the President. It is reported that King said that he hopes to have an understanding to sell aircraft to Britain and France, and that this move does not violate neutrality. At the same time, President Roosevelt also expressed concern about the national socialism that is invading Latin America, advocating expanding American trade to defeat national socialism.

German Newspapers Criticize

Berlin - President Roosevelt's statement has been commented on by German newspapers. "The People's Observer" stated, "President Roosevelt despises American law. His supply of aircraft to France has actually constituted a rare inferiority in the American government's behavior." The Evening News used the headline "Is the American Border on the Rhine River?" "After Hitler first gave a speech advocating peace, President Roosevelt actually had this unbelievable provocative act." The newspaper's correspondent in New York declared, "President Roosevelt's actions are the only ones seen since the European War, and it is appropriate to call him Wilson II. The United States has now abandoned its neutral policy, and Washington has become the provocative center of the war against omnipotent regimes since yesterday." (Havas Dispatch on the 1st)

The German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Communist Pact

Transformation into a Military Alliance: Difficult to Achieve for a While

Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch: Japanese envoys to European countries recently met in Paris to discuss the issue of whether the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Communist Pact should be revised into a military alliance treaty to deal with the civilized countries of Western Europe at the same time. It is reported that to deal with Britain. It is reported that according to well-informed sources here, the envoys have different opinions. Therefore, this decision-making meeting only exchanged information. It will be necessary to continue to meet several times before recommending specific policies to the Tokyo government. In general, regarding anti-Soviet actions, if Japan cannot come out to participate and assume definite tasks, it will be difficult to achieve military coordination between Germany, Italy, and Japan for a while. If Germany and Italy have an affair with the Soviet Union and have affairs in the Mediterranean, military coordination may not be achieved either. (Dispatch on the 31st)

### Japanese Finances

Runaway Inflation, Industry and Commerce in Decline

Chongqing – According to a Havas news agency report from New Delhi, Japan's financial difficulties have reached the point of runaway inflation, which is made even more credible by its new budget reaching a massive 10 billion yen. The amount of paper money issued by the country was 1 billion yen in 1932, but has recently increased to 2 billion yen, while industry and commerce have declined. The abnormal development of military industries is of no benefit and is even harmful to ordinary industry and commerce. Its production is decreasing daily, while price indices are increasing. According to statistics published by the Bank of Japan, the retail price index, assuming 1914 to be 100, was 174 in June 1937, and rose to 203 in the same month last year. The standard of living in 1937 was 194, but rose to 211 last year. The severity of the crisis is self-evident. Moreover, the new massive budget is sufficient to exacerbate this crisis. Based on this, industry and commerce in the Japanese-occupied areas of China will inevitably be desolate, and there is little hope for improvement. Disputes between Japan and various related countries will also become increasingly serious, it can be asserted. (Dispatch, 31st)

### Gayda's Article

Attempt to Control the Mediterranean, Italian Ambition Clearly Visible

Berlin – Gayda, the editor-in-chief of the "Giornale d'Italia" and a senator, published an article yesterday in the organ of the German Hitler Youth, revealing Italy's objectives in the Mediterranean. The article strongly advocated the policy of the German-Italian axis, naturally designating German interests in Southeast Europe and Italian interests in the Mediterranean. It went on to say that both Britain and France hold anti-Italian policies in the Mediterranean, which was evident during the Abyssinian War. However, as a result, Italy not only gained territory but also achieved political victory in the Mediterranean. Gayda acknowledged that the British government under Chamberlain is more conciliatory, but is still actively expanding its military. After the Abyssinian War, Britain felt there were only two paths: one was to open a new sea route to India via the United States, and the other was to concentrate its navy in the Mediterranean to be able to repel attacks from any direction. As a result, the second path was adopted. France also has the same objective, but in a more selfish way. The Mediterranean is France's shortest route to the East and Africa. France is preparing to conscript 1.5 million black soldiers from Africa to fight in France if it goes to war with Germany and Italy. Gayda believes that this is France's imperial attempt to threaten Europe. At the same time, the mass conscription of black people violates the principles of European culture. After attacking Britain and France, Gayda declared that the strength of the Italian army, the relationship of solidarity with Germany, the agreement with Yugoslavia, and the friendship with various Arab countries can counteract this anti-Italian policy. Therefore, "Italian policy is aimed at defending against British and French aggression." Moreover, the colonies of Britain and France are only for military and political purposes, while Italy is burdened with overpopulation. Therefore, in order to protect its national interests in the Mediterranean, Italy is determined to prevent all "future threats." (Haitong Dispatch, 1st)

### Eastern Newspaper's Commentary

Axis of Aggression, Three in One

Tokyo – Japanese newspapers are generally satisfied with Hitler's speech in the Reichstag, especially with the two points in Hitler's speech concerning the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Sino-Japanese War. According to the "Nichinichi Shimbun", a local newspaper, in its commentary on Hitler's speech, Germany's dissatisfaction with Britain and France stems from their inability to treat Germany fairly, and their hope that Germany will always be in distress and unable to become a strong country. The newspaper believes that Hitler's speech regarding East Asia is very reasonable, and praises Hitler's ability to establish the Anti-Comintern Pact, forming a united front between Japan, Germany and Italy to jointly oppose communism. The newspaper also said that Britain and France should, in principle, promptly return to Germany what they had seized in the past, in response to Hitler's demand for the return of old colonies. However, the "Nichinichi Shimbun" did not mention the fact that the islands in the Pacific mandated to Japan were formerly owned by Germany. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" also said that if Britain hopes to achieve its own peace and security, it should acknowledge Germany's right to exist. The newspaper then discussed the peace declaration made by Germany and France in November, saying that this is a manifestation of Hitler's policy of appeasement, but Hitler will never turn a blind eye to the unfair treatment he is currently suffering because of this declaration, and it is not logically sound. Finally, the newspaper stated that Germany is prepared to support Italy's demands for colonies from France, because Italy supported Germany when it took action in Austria and Czechoslovakia last year, so Hitler is now reciprocating.

### Soviet Union Announces Outline of Draft Revised Party Constitution

Recruitment of Party Members Should Eliminate Class Differences, and Suggests Abolishing Periodic Mass Purges

Moscow – The outline of the draft revised Party Constitution, which Zhdanov will report at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (to be convened on March 10), was recently published by local newspapers. The report first suggests that because the class boundaries among the working people of the Soviet Union have been eliminated, and the economic and political contradictions between workers, peasants, and intellectuals are gradually being eliminated and tend to disappear, the conditions for the Communist Party to recruit new party members should be revised. Currently, the procedures for recruiting party members are divided into four classes according to the social status of the applicant. This method is clearly inconsistent with the class structure of Soviet society since the victory of socialism. Therefore, the report proposes to abolish the current class distinctions in the recruitment of party members. In the future, when new party members join, whether they are workers, peasants, or intellectuals, the procedures should be the same. The report then proposes to add a clause on the rights of party members to the Party Constitution. In the past, these rights were considered self-evident and were not listed in the Party Constitution. The new clause should stipulate that party members have the right to criticize any party staff at party meetings, to elect and be elected into party organs, and to request to attend and participate whenever their activities or behaviors are discussed and decided upon, and to submit any questions or statements to any party organization, including the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party. The report then proposes to abolish the periodic mass purges, because this method was adopted at the beginning of the New Economic Policy and there is no reason for its continued existence. In practice, experience has proven that this method cannot individually examine party members, and as a result, it is ineffective against opposing elements who are good at concealing themselves, while it expels loyal and conscious party members on the grounds of being passive. The report suggests that when deciding on the expulsion of party membership, a very cautious and caring attitude towards comrades must be adopted, the reasons for the accusations against party members must be carefully investigated, the rights of party members must be protected from being harmed by any arbitrary actions, and expulsion of party membership should be used as the party's highest punishment, only when absolutely necessary.

The report also proposes to include in the Party Constitution the various measures that the Party has already implemented to ensure the practical realization of democracy within the Party, such as secret ballots in Party elections, prohibition of elections by list, Party members can freely criticize and attack candidates, and convene meetings of active workers of city and district Party committees on a regular basis. Because the primary organizational task of the Party is the correct selection of cadres and the investigation of the implementation status of resolutions, the report suggests that a Cadre Department be established under the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, and Cadre Departments be established under the provincial and regional Party committees, the central committees of the Party in the national republics, and the city and district committees.

In order to raise the Party's propaganda and agitation work to the proper level, the report suggests that a Propaganda and Agitation Department be established under the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, and Propaganda and Agitation Departments be established under the provincial and regional Party committees, the central committees of the Party in the national republics, and the city and district committees.

Because the pace of the Party and national life is accelerating, and in order to address urgent issues in the Party's policy, the report proposes that at least one plenary meeting of representatives from local Party departments across the Soviet Union be convened each year to make a resolution, and that the meeting be empowered to recall members of the Central Committee who fail to effectively fulfill their responsibilities and replace them with other members, provided that the number does not exceed one-fifth of the number of Central Committee members elected by the Party Congress. The decisions of the aforementioned meeting, with the exception of the replacement of Central Committee members, must be approved by the Central Committee.

Because the Party's basic organizations have become increasingly strong and are increasingly closely related to practical administrative and cultural work, the report suggests that in order to strengthen the position of each basic organization within each production unit, including state-owned and collective farms, and to increase their degree of responsibility to each unit, these organizations should be granted the right to supervise the work of the administrative organizations of each unit. The Party organizations in the People's Committees, due to the special working conditions of the Soviet organs, cannot implement supervision, must notify the Central Committee of the Party and the leading staff of the People's Committees of the shortcomings in the work of the People's Committees and their respective members.

In order to create conditions for promoting new cadres to leading positions within the Party, the report suggests that the minimum Party record for secretaries of provincial and regional committees and central committees of national republics be five years or more (previously twelve years), and the minimum Party record for secretaries of lower-level Party departments should also be shortened accordingly.

### French Chamber of Deputies Passes Bill

Extending Mandatory Military Service

Current Troop Levels for Army and Air Force Deemed Necessary to Increase

Paris – Because of the reduced birth rate during the European War, the government previously promulgated a law in 1936 stipulating that the duration of mandatory military service should be increased from one and a half years to two years until 1940, in order to make up for the shortfall. The Chamber of Deputies also passed a bill this afternoon stipulating that the two-year military service system will continue to apply after 1940, thus becoming a permanent measure. In addition, a bill was passed stipulating that the training period for soldiers in the army reserve should not be extended, but their numbers should be increased. During the discussion, the reporter of the conscription bill, Isner, delivered a speech saying that the German army currently has 900,000 active troops. The active troop level of the French army headquarters is only 450,000. In addition, since the establishment of the German-Italian axis, the northeastern and southeastern borders of France must be defended simultaneously. After the military equipment is fully equipped and fortifications are added to the border, the army personnel also need to be increased. Therefore, for various reasons, the current active troop level must be increased to 550,000 to be sufficient. The need to increase the current number of officers and soldiers in the anti-aircraft artillery and air force is even more important. The Minister of Aviation, Lai Shangboer, then gave a speech on France's order of airplanes from the United States, saying, "What our country has ordered is the best American airplane, which should be attributed to President Roosevelt." The monthly production of French aircraft factories is currently 90 units, which can be increased to 100 units. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)

### British Government Plans New War Risk Law

Specifies Compensation Methods for Damage Suffered in War

London – Today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon delivered his first important speech in the House of Commons regarding war risk insurance, saying that the government has considered methods of paying compensation to those who die or are injured as a result of air raids and other war actions. A plan has now been drafted, including casualties among civilians and commercial ships. The payment of compensation will not be delayed until after the end of the emergency period. In addition, a plan for the emergency revitalization of property in central locations, including housing, has been drafted. Plans for marine war risk insurance and war risk insurance for various goods between ships and warehouses will be announced soon. The government has drafted an insurance plan for maintaining the various major land goods necessary for people's lives during wartime, including export trade, and premiums will be collected. This plan will be forcibly implemented during wartime. Retail merchants who store various major goods will insure each item to avoid losses. The government's conclusion is that the principle of implementing war risk insurance should regard this loss or injury as not only related to those who directly suffer it, but must be regarded as the concern of the entire people. Simon continued, regarding various private properties, there have been suggestions that the government establish an insurance plan, collecting insurance from each property owner, and then bear all the compensation in the event of any damage. This proposal has been thoroughly reviewed and found to be a difficulty that is not easy to overcome in practice, that is, there is no possible basis for accurate calculation. However, this does not mean that the government will not pay attention to the losses of individuals, and will provide higher compensation depending on the situation of the country after the war. Once the extent of private property losses has been ascertained, if circumstances permit, compensation will be made from public funds in accordance with regulations sufficient to fully reimburse some limit of their losses, so there will be gradations. A compensation committee will be established soon, headed by a British judge. As for the collection of compensation claims and the recording of damages, they will be handled by the appraisers of the Inland Revenue Department. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)

Girona – The Spanish Government Ministry of National Defense issued a war report last night stating that on the Catalonia front, government forces have been quite successful in the battles at the Querino and Arrans positions. The Italian divisions of the Nationalist forces have attacked several times, but have all been repulsed.

The government forces resisted desperately, and have not abandoned important strongholds so far.

They encountered determined resistance from the government forces at various important strongholds. It is expected that the government forces will take advantage of the natural defenses in the mountainous areas to reorganize their positions and prepare to fight a desperate battle with the Nationalist forces. The government forces on the Vich front are also resisting strongly, because if the Nationalist forces break through the front line there, the government forces in that area will be in danger of being surrounded, and the natural defenses outside the mountains will be completely ineffective.

### Germany Desires Peace, Britain Genuinely Shares the Sentiment

Chamberlain's Speech Echoes Hitler

International Negotiations Considered Premature

London - Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, outlining the current foreign policy, stating, "Hitler has expressed a strong desire for mutual trust and cooperation between the British and German nations. I welcome this expression, and I would like to take this opportunity to state that the British government and people fully share this sentiment." Although the British and German governments are not currently considering any negotiations, it is gratifying that representatives of both countries' industries are currently engaged in talks. Regarding Hitler's entire speech yesterday, "I personally believe that the speaker is not one who is preparing to incite another crisis in Europe. He has even repeatedly expressed that a peaceful situation is necessary for Germany, a view shared by us." I believe that all international issues can be resolved through negotiations, "But if the international atmosphere is not good, then proceeding with negotiations to resolve disputes, satisfy desires, and eliminate grievances will be futile. In other words, when conducting negotiations, if those involved do not believe that all participants are pursuing peace and earnestly hope for a peaceful solution, and are not harboring ulterior motives, it will be of no avail. After a long period of anxiety and concern, European countries are now gradually restoring confidence. I would like to inform the world that what we want to see is not only a desire for peace, but also to find more concrete evidence before reaching a final solution. In other words, even if countries cannot disarm, they should at least have the intention of limiting armaments. If such an opportunity arises, the entire British people will not only sympathize with it, but will also do their utmost to ease the general situation in Europe. This can be stated with certainty," he said. (31st Havas dispatch)

London - During yesterday's House of Commons debate on foreign affairs, Prime Minister Chamberlain declared, "We are now beginning to see the effects of our long-term preparations for rearmament. The public in all areas now feels that our efforts have greatly increased our defense capabilities. Our prestige abroad has never been higher than it is today, and our friendship has never been as eagerly sought by other countries as it is today. The claim made by Attlee a moment ago that the policy of appeasement has failed is inaccurate. In fact, I am still making it progress gradually."

Reiterating the Relationship between Britain and France

"I hope that our visit to Rome has strengthened the friendship between Britain and Italy, while not weakening our relationship with France. The closeness and intimacy of the relationship between Britain and France is almost unprecedented in our memory. Moreover, this relationship is now based on mutual trust, which is far different from what it used to be."

The House of Commons reconvened today after the Christmas recess, and the general public expected a debate on foreign affairs and eagerly wanted to hear it. Therefore, the House was packed, and both the public and private galleries were full. The diplomatic corps seats were also filled. The debate began after the question period, led by opposition leader Attlee.

Satisfied with Herr Hitler's Speech

The Prime Minister said in his speech that the British government was greatly satisfied with the recent declarations of France and Germany, and that the excessive panic and predictions seen in the general newspapers before Hitler's speech have now been dispelled by the facts. Herr Hitler's speech was very long, involving many events and covering a wide range. I do not presume to say that I have had time to study it sentence by sentence with caution, but I can say that I definitely have the impression that it was a speech not issued by someone who is preparing to throw Europe into another crisis. I believe that many sections of the speech indicate that Germany urgently needs peace, just like other countries. We all have our own internal problems, our own economic or financial problems, or unemployment problems in one country, or other problems in other countries. Politicians of all countries should concentrate on improving the conditions of their own people today. None of us can fail to sympathize with this view." Before mentioning Hitler's speech, the Prime Minister had also referred to it in his answer during the question period.

In his answer, the Prime Minister said that he welcomed the section of Herr Hitler's speech in which he expressed his strong desire for mutual trust and cooperation between the British and German peoples. "I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that the British government and people share this sentiment. The British government is not currently considering negotiations with Germany, but is very pleased to declare that representatives of the two countries' industries have recently held a discussion on many industrial matters."

Adhering to the Policy of Non-Intervention

The Prime Minister continued, "The policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War is proceeding satisfactorily, and it is not yet time to change this policy. I do not believe that the current situation in Spain is enough to endanger the peace of Europe, but I would like to state clearly that any large-scale intervention at this time would inevitably lead to the expansion of war in Europe and be a disaster for peace. This is why the government is unwilling to change its policy of non-intervention."

Refuting the Opposition Party's Remarks

The Prime Minister then addressed the opposition leader Attlee's claim that General Franco's victory would pose a military threat to Britain, saying that the Foreign Secretary and himself, while recently in Rome, received renewed assurances from Mussolini and Count Ciano that once the Spanish Civil War ended, Italy would not make any demands on Spain. Hitler also made the same assurances. As for the Spanish refugees, the government has done its best to help them, and will continue to do so in the future. He hopes that General Franco will allow the establishment of a neutral and safe zone to accommodate women, children, and the wounded. It is heard that the French government is working hard with the Spanish government to deal with this matter. The Prime Minister criticized the opposition party for not taking the worst possible view of the will of the leaders of totalitarian countries, for not making all sorts of illusions about uncertain rumors to frighten themselves, and for not making all sorts of nitpicking remarks about Britain's strength. He believes that although the problems between countries are serious, there is nothing that cannot be resolved through discussion, but he must add that if the atmosphere has not improved, and if those engaged in discussion do not feel that those present are all willing to obtain a peaceful solution, and do not harbor malicious intentions in their hearts, then it is impossible to proceed with discussion to eliminate differences of opinion, fulfill desires, and dispel grievances.

The Prime Minister refuted the opposition party's disbelief in the statements made by Mussolini and Hitler, saying, "For those who give assurances that the speaker will keep their word, there is no worse way than to tell people, 'Don't believe them. Your actions can be based on your assumption that the person will not keep their word.' I dare say that Attlee is mistaken. Before we proceed with a final solution, we want to see clear evidence from all sides that they are willing to form an alliance, if not an alliance to disarm, then an alliance to limit armaments. Once this opportunity arises, if we can see everywhere a spirit that is in line with our own, then I know that Britain must be prepared to contribute to general appeasement." (1st Reuters dispatch)

Report on the Visit to Rome

London - Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons yesterday on his visit to Rome, saying that Mussolini, during the Anglo-Italian talks, had guaranteed that he had no demands on Spain. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also reiterated Mussolini's guarantee, saying that Italy had no territorial ambitions for any Spanish territory. We cannot regard the discussions in formal meetings or negotiations as containing exploratory or informal natures. Therefore, the general impression he received was that Mussolini first clearly stated that Italy's policy was peace, and that he would be happy to use his power to uphold peace when necessary. Mussolini further explained that the Berlin-Rome Axis was the key to Italian foreign policy, and we similarly explained that Anglo-French cooperation was the foundation of British policy, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister continued, "Mussolini expressed satisfaction with the terms of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, and repeatedly and solemnly reiterated Italy's willingness to abide by the obligations stipulated in the agreement. We know that the biggest obstacle between France and Italy is the Spanish issue, so it seems unlikely that the negotiations between France and Italy will yield any results before the end of the Spanish Civil War. Regarding arms reduction, Mussolini agreed that the first step was to implement qualitative restrictions. Mussolini believes that the Jewish question is international in nature and must be dealt with generously." Zhang said that the atmosphere during the Anglo-Italian talks was extremely harmonious. It is difficult to expect that all the points of contention and opinions raised by both sides will be accepted by the other side. Therefore, although it is impossible to report that both sides have agreed on all points during the talks, the purpose of the talks has indeed been achieved. Zhang finally mentioned the meeting with the Pope, saying that he and Halifax were deeply moved by the courage and humanitarian spirit shown in the Pope's demeanor and actions.

### Labor Party and Liberal Party Criticize the Government

Blindly Accommodating and Tolerating, Only Encouraging Aggression

London - During yesterday's House of Commons debate on foreign affairs, opposition leader Attlee began with the Spanish issue. Attlee said that when the Prime Minister mentioned that Mussolini was committed to peace, the people of Great Britain were even more moved because Mussolini had interfered in the Spanish war for at least two and a half years. The Prime Minister should be aware that general public opinion in Britain is increasingly dissatisfied with the attitude taken by the British government in the entire Spanish war. Italy's own declarations and the facts are obvious, but it is foolish to try to cover up Italy's assistance to the Nationalists in the offensive taken in Catalonia. More than half of the troops attacking Barcelona were Italians. The Italians have celebrated the fall of Barcelona as a great victory for Italy. The actions of the British government in the entire Spanish issue, except for the Nyon Agreement which was barely satisfactory, have all definitely encouraged the aggressors.

Liberal opposition leader Sinclair rose to speak, saying that although there is no reason to take a pessimistic view, the government's lack of policy is indeed not reassuring. Although we are rearming on the one hand, we have lost the assistance of important and powerful forces overseas. We could rely on this force to resist aggression a few months ago, but now the Rome-Berlin Axis has become a geographical and military reality on the map of Europe, dividing Europe into two major parts, east and west. Britain should now show its position of adopting freedom and international goodwill, with neither shame nor fear. We are willing to help the German, Italian and other peoples establish a just and upright world order. Prime Minister Chamberlain has now added a debt to the cause of peace. The Prime Minister has made a large part of the German and Italian people believe in the goodwill and peaceful intentions of himself and all those who protect Britain. Many people in Germany and Italy have found the symbols of politeness, tolerance and calmness under the Prime Minister and his umbrella, and when comparing it with the proud attitude of the rulers of the totalitarian countries, they feel its beauty.

Labor Party leader Greenwood then rose to speak, ending the debate. It is said that we should know that 130 British ships have been attacked by Franco's troops, and the protests made by Britain have all been ignored. Intervention in the Spanish war has been strengthened. The position of the British government is indeed very abnormal, because it believes that supplying the Spanish government with military supplies may promote war between countries, while Germany and Italy's clear assistance to Franco can achieve peace. As for the claim that all of Franco's large quantities of weapons were obtained as prisoners, it is absurd. In fact, they were all provided by the two countries with whom our Prime Minister cooperates most closely. Greenwood concluded by saying that the danger of war lies only in two people, namely Hitler and Mussolini. (1st Reuters dispatch)

### Chamberlain's Remarks Greatly Reassure People

Paris Expresses Gratification

Berlin Newspapers Unanimously Praise

Berlin - German newspapers unanimously praised the speech delivered by British Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying that the speech was delivered 24 hours after Hitler addressed the Reichstag, so it can be regarded as a positive response from the British authorities. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung wrote, "Among Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, the German side should be satisfied with what Herr Hitler said. In addition, the British opposition leader actually misinterpreted what Herr Hitler said, 'If another country goes to war with Italy, no matter what the motive, Germany will definitely help Italy.' It is especially commendable that Prime Minister Chamberlain has effectively corrected this." The Hamburger Fremdenblatt wrote, "Prime Minister Chamberlain has fully expressed the thoughts of people around the world after Herr Hitler delivered his speech. The fastest official response from foreign politicians is like this, so it is known that the lasting and fair policy of peace advocated by Herr Hitler has won a victory. In addition, there is one point in Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech that cannot be ignored, that is, the general professional pessimists are blinded by the long-standing prejudice against the totalitarian countries in Europe. Therefore, they thought that Herr Hitler's speech yesterday was about to cause a crisis. Now, Prime Minister Chamberlain's words have refuted their falsehoods." (1st Havas dispatch)

Berlin - Berlin newspapers published news about the news, all under the following and similar headlines: "London Changes Attitude", "The Nightmare is Over", "The World Gains an Exceptionally Deep Impression". The Deutsche Tageszeitung wrote, "Germany's contribution to the reorganization of Europe has made accurate remarks at the appropriate time. We must wait eagerly and see how other politicians receive the direction of German foreign policy and how they accept it. The German local newspaper warned the world not to misunderstand Herr Hitler's speech, saying that the huge problem has never lost its seriousness, urgency and strength. However, this problem has been raised in a way that puts the opponents in a bad position from the beginning. Those who thought they were distributing the world, that is, the powerful country in one country's business, namely Britain, have definitely felt it." (1st Reuters dispatch)

Paris - The speech delivered by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday was warmly welcomed by France, and it was agreed to welcome the Prime Minister's clear statement on Anglo-French cooperation, believing that the Prime Minister's speech was greatly reassuring. (1st Reuters dispatch)

Paris - After German Herr Hitler delivered a speech yesterday, British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons today in response. Responsible persons here said that these two speeches are greatly beneficial to the convening of an international peace conference to resolve the issues of colonies and arms reduction, but it is necessary for Italian Minister Mussolini not to block the door of the policy of appeasement before it can be done. Prime Minister Chamberlain once said that he would conduct negotiations in order to achieve a general solution. The goal is to adapt the German viewpoint to the policies pursued by Britain and France. This policy was determined by former French Prime Minister Chautemps and former Foreign Minister Delbos when they visited London in November 1937. In other words, the colonial issue must be considered within the scope of a general solution, and the arms reduction issue should also be included in the scope of a general solution. Responsible persons here also said that it is noteworthy that Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet advocated the convening of an international peace conference in their speeches in the Chamber of Deputies a few days ago, and German Herr Hitler did not oppose this. How this matter will develop in the future will naturally be judged by what demands Italian Minister Mussolini will make at the meeting of the Fascist Party's Supreme Council on the fourth of next month (31st Havas dispatch)

### Anniversary of the Founding of the Fascist Party Army

Nationwide Celebration Mussolini Holds Military Parade

Rome - Today is the 16th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Party Army. Flags are hung throughout the country to celebrate, and military parades are held. The celebration here was held in front of the graves of the war dead in the European war, and the situation was very enthusiastic. Prime Minister Mussolini, wearing the uniform of the commander of the Party Army, first presented medals to the families of the Party Army soldiers who died in the Abyssinian and Spanish campaigns, and then reviewed 20,000 Party Army members. The audience was very crowded, and they cheered and saluted the Prime Minister. (1st Havas dispatch)

London, New York, Berlin - Stock Prices Soar

London - Today's stock market prices have all soared, which proves that the people of this city have calmed down after Hitler's speech was published, and they feel satisfied with the relatively moderate tone of Herr Hitler's speech. (31st Reuters dispatch)

New York - Hitler's speech was more moderate than expected, so Wall Street's financial market rose by three pounds. Prime Minister Chamberlain's hopeful tone also made the market slightly optimistic. (1st Reuters dispatch)

Berlin - Hitler's mention of "a long period of peace" has given a very good impression here. In the Berlin Stock Exchange, general securities have all seen an increase, and stocks and securities have increased by one pound to two pounds. Political figures expressed satisfaction with Britain's satisfaction with Herr Hitler's speech, but they were quite doubtful whether Britain had drawn the correct conclusion from this speech. Many people said that Herr Hitler did not clearly raise the colonial issue in this decision, but only wanted to put this issue aside again. Political figures solemnly declared that Herr Hitler clearly recognized this as an issue that must be resolved, so they planned to start a major propaganda campaign on the colonial issue. The German people, who had been silent for a long time, would now revive their "colonial consciousness," which would begin today. Jews and churches felt that Herr Hitler's speech was quite unfavorable to them, and even threatened them. (1st Reuters dispatch)

### All Overseas Chinese in San Francisco Actively Raise Funds to Relieve Compatriots in Distress

Aiming to Raise One Million US Dollars, Promoting an Embargo on War Materials to Japan

A special dispatch from the Continental Daily, San Francisco, January 14, states that the United Chinese War Relief Association of San Francisco is enthusiastically conducting a campaign to raise one million US dollars to relieve Chinese refugees. It has already raised US$30,000 in cash, and pledges have reached US$200,000. On December 6th of last year, the Association held a meeting attended by more than 300 overseas Chinese men and women, and passed a resolution stating, "We sincerely support the National Government and resist the enemy to the end. We will abide by the Association's regulations and continue the fundraising campaign until the goal of one million US dollars is reached." During the meeting, the overseas Chinese unanimously declared, "If we do not abide by the Association's regulations or refuse to collect funds, we are willing to accept the most severe punishment from the Association." Then, the overseas Chinese attending the meeting, except for a team formed by women, were divided into eleven teams. Each team held a flag, each taking one character from the phrase "American Overseas Chinese Cooperate to Save China," and walked slowly through the streets of Chinatown, singing patriotic songs, and starting the first day of work. Overseas Chinese teenagers and youths here have been preparing a few days ago to mail anti-Japanese printed matter to 6,000 famous American beauties and overseas Chinese in the United States. The printed matter contains a booklet entitled "Japan's Ally is the United States," which laments that the United States donates food and medicine to China on one hand, while supplying Japan with war materials on the other. Each booklet includes a postcard addressed to President Roosevelt at the White House. The postcard is mailed to Washington by the recipients of the booklet. The booklet also includes a short note saying, "Greetings to you and President Roosevelt. We hope that you will promote an embargo on war materials to Japan, so that the Chinese people will be more pleased next year." The Association's campaign will last for ten months. During this period, every overseas Chinese in San Francisco can expect to donate at least US$50, either paid in full at once or in ten installments. Those who are exempt from paying are limited to the old, weak, poor, sick, or unemployed. The campaign will focus on soliciting public pledges for the first five days, and will begin automatic pledges from this year onwards. Those who donate in cash at that time will be given a red badge for identification. If the staff of this campaign are absent without reason, they will be fined US$2.50 per absence. If they request an exemption or are unable to pay after pledging, a committee will investigate their personal circumstances. According to Tang Jun (transliteration), chairman of the Association, the previous two fundraising campaigns for relief work in China have raised US$1.6 million, equivalent to 10 million Chinese currency. The first campaign lasted from August 20th to November 20th of the previous year, and the second lasted from November 21st to December 4th of last year. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shi sent a telegram to the Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco, which was forwarded to the headquarters of the Association, publicly endorsing the work.

### Foreign Trade in Yantai under Japanese Control Suffers a Blow

Guerrillas in the Suburbs Attack from Time to Time

Few Italian Overseas Chinese Actually Set Up a New Consulate

A special dispatch from the Continental Daily correspondent in Yantai, January 17, states that in the peaceful city of Yantai, Japanese merchants are gathered, and it has been controlled by Japanese sailors and "managed" by a puppet government controlled by the Japanese. Yantai is also the target of frequent guerrilla attacks. Japan once fired cannons to bombard it last year, but foreign expatriates believe that Yantai is still more fortunate than other occupied cities. The business community here is gloomy and the future is bleak. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in the summer of the previous year, the people in this area of Shandong have indeed ignited a patriotic heart that has not been seen for hundreds of years. Not long ago, the Japanese overseas Chinese in Yantai had to withdraw in a hurry. According to the order of Han Fuju, the chairman of Shandong Province at the time, strong fortifications were built in the suburbs of this city, and perfect preparations were made to resist attacks. The Chamber of Commerce contributed 30,000 yuan to build ten concrete and steel-framed fortresses on the seaside to defend against naval attacks. The fortresses were built very well and still stand today. However, the Chinese side had no intention of defending Yantai, so the entire army withdrew one day, and it took half a month for the Japanese army to arrive. However, the Japanese army soon went elsewhere, and 600 Japanese sailors and Manchukuo soldiers were stationed there. In the past year, Japanese merchants have returned to Yantai one after another, and the number of Japanese overseas Chinese has greatly increased compared to before the war. All port affairs are controlled by the Japanese, and the import and export tax rates have been changed, which of course gives Japanese goods preferential treatment. Foreign trade was initially prosperous, but when exchange control was implemented, export activities suffered a serious blow. Not long after Yantai was occupied, a consualte of Italy was established, which was a first in the history of Yantai and caused quite a surprise among foreign expatriates, because there were only three Italian expatriates in Yantai. Although the guerrillas have inferior guns, they attack from time to time in the suburbs of Yantai, causing the invaders to disappear. Therefore, the Japanese army has built solid sandbag obstacles on the nearby mountains. The Japanese army has formed a puppet government in Yantai, the same as in Tianjin and Nanjing, hanging five-color flags. Before the war, the chief consuls in Yantai were often British and American consuls, but now the Japanese side has obtained the title of "chief consul."

### Mass Mobilization Forces of Various Counties in Northern Jiangsu Complete Reorganization and Gradually Become Regularized

Monthly Salaries Issued; On-the-Spot Exactions Strictly Prohibited

Provincial Committee Assigns Qi Shuzu as Magistrate of Xinghua County

Taixian Dispatch: The headquarters of the Northern Jiangsu ×th Guerrilla Zone and various units have successively completed reorganization. All salaries will be uniformly issued from provincial funds, and local militias will also be funded by the county governments. A public notice was specifically issued yesterday, strictly prohibiting the pretext of raising funds to demand from the people. The notice is recorded below: "Since the fall of Jiangnan, the people of various counties have gathered under righteous banners, with numerous units. Procuring salaries, weapons, and uniforms has been difficult. Some units have occasionally raised funds from the people on their own to meet urgent needs. Under the circumstances at the time, it was a last resort and understandable. However, the people in the war zone have suffered greatly, and the floods along the canal are becoming increasingly severe. How can the survivors bear further burdens? Now, all units in this area have successively completed reorganization and are gradually becoming regularized. All salaries will henceforth be issued by the provincial government, and local militias will also be funded by the county governments on a monthly basis. Other military supplies will be centrally managed and distributed by this headquarters, so there is no need to worry about shortages. From now on, no unit is allowed to use the pretext of raising funds to demand from the people, in order to prevent disturbances and alleviate the suffering of the people of Jiangsu. Anyone who dares to violate this will be severely punished according to military law once discovered, without leniency. In addition to separate orders, this public notice is issued for general knowledge. Let everyone abide by it and not violate it."

Eliminating Sea Bandits: The coastal ports of Yancheng, Dongtai, and other counties in the northern region have long been areas where sea bandits gather, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, kidnapping and extorting ransoms, which has been frequently heard of. However, since Commander Zhang of the Jiangsu Provincial Industrial Security Corps led his troops to station there, he has, on the one hand, dispatched teams to patrol the sea, so that the bandits have nowhere to hide, and on the other hand, dispatched troops to strictly search and suppress them, repeatedly engaging in fierce battles with the bandits, rescuing kidnap victims, and capturing bandit leaders. In just a few months, the coastal area has become peaceful, and the nearby people have sung praises endlessly. Recently, Yuan Xiangchen, the independent battalion commander of the corps, Shen Yueting, the seventh battalion commander, together with Deng Famai, the ninth company commander of the third battalion, and Lu Chaoqun, the artillery team leader, encountered bandits in Nanlinjiadun while patrolling the sea and engaged in a fierce battle. In addition to the capture of seven bandit leaders, including Chen Qingxiang, all the rest were killed, two bandit ships and several guns were seized, and two kidnap victims were rescued. The two battalion commanders, Shen and Yuan, have already presented the situation of suppressing the bandits to Commander Zhang for review and handling.

Qingtai Telephone Communication: The long-distance telephone between Taixian and Qingjiangpu used to be connected via Yangzhou, but since the fall of Yangzhou, it has become increasingly delayed. Previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Exchange requested and was approved to set up a telephone line from Gaoyou to Fanchuan to Taixian. It has now been completed and tested, and the sound is very clear. A branch office has also been established in Fanchuan to open for business. The toll from Qingjiangpu to Taixian is 86 cents per call. It is also heard that the vacancy of Xinghua County Magistrate, which was originally held concurrently by Jin Zonghua, the Administrative Inspector of the district, has now been filled by Qi Shuzu, who has been appointed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government as the magistrate of the county. Jin Zonghua will then serve exclusively as the Inspector and concurrently as the District Security Commander. It is said that Qi has already left the province for Xinghua to take up his new post.

Each of the Zhejiang Provincial Specialty Products Transportation and Sales Offices will also send a representative to Shanghai to work together.

### Production and Sales of Sichuan Province Commodities in the Second Year of the War of Resistance

Reduced Imports Due to Difficult Transportation

Sales of Local Products Still Inevitably Suffer from Stagnation

Chongqing Dispatch: Sichuan is the province with the richest products and the largest consumption volume in the southwestern provinces. Chongqing can be regarded as the general hub for the collection and distribution of all native products of Sichuan and Kang provinces, as well as parts of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Gansu provinces, and imported commodities. Exported commodities have always been dominated by tung oil, silk, bristles, wool, medicinal materials, and sheepskins. Imported commodities have always been dominated by cotton yarn, piece goods, Soviet goods, hardware, dried vegetables, pigments, and Western medicine. In addition, there are two kinds of products with extremely high output, sold in this province, neighboring provinces, and the Far East: Sichuan salt and Sichuan earth. In Chongqing, they can only be listed as commodities similar to transit trade, but the total business volume is higher than that of general import and export goods. Sichuan earth, in the process of being banned for six years, still seems to hold the leading position in the Chongqing market. After the start of the war, exported commodities, initially with Hong Kong, Hankou, and the Yangtze River traffic not yet obstructed, the export volume was still considerable. Later, with the interruption of the Yangtze River traffic and the inconsistent foreign exchange settlement prices, which were unfavorable to the operation of the export industry, the export volume inevitably declined greatly for a time. Domestic trade has also changed from time to time due to the different scope of sales markets. Most of the imported goods have also reduced the amount of intake and changed their appearance due to transportation difficulties and changes in the route of arrival. Wool, one of the exported goods, even lost its original position last year and became an unimportant commodity. Recently, although it is estimated that since the War of Resistance, the capital flowing into Sichuan Province should be in the range of 150 million to 200 million yuan, the various machines transported into Sichuan Province are indeed more than 100,000 tons, and various technical experts have also gathered in Sichuan Province. There are dozens or hundreds of factories and firms that have moved to Sichuan, but the functions of transporting and selling local products and supplying necessities have not yet been fully demonstrated. Local products still inevitably have a sense of stagnation, and the items needed by the people still inevitably have a sense of lack. This is really a great opportunity for entrepreneurs from all over the country to come to Sichuan to engage in industry and commerce. Please describe the general situation of the production and sales of various important commodities in Chongqing in the twenty-seventh year for the entrepreneurs.

Exported Goods

Tung oil, which has always occupied the first place in the export value of Sichuan Province, is in great demand in the international market. At the peak of sales, it could be 700,000 dan per year, with a total value of more than 25 million yuan. Last year, 330,000 dan were shipped out, with a total value of more than 16 million yuan. After the interruption of the Guangdong-Hankou traffic, the average monthly export value was only about 1% of what it was before the interruption. As a result, the sales volume was greatly reduced, and the oil price even fell from more than 50 yuan per dan to 17 or 18 yuan at one time. At the end of the year, although some people hoarded a large amount, the market price rebounded to 23 or 24 yuan, but foreign transportation was still not very smooth. Generally, people hope that foreign trade can be directly operated by the state in the future, so as to maintain the prosperity of domestic production and enable the country to obtain a continuous increase in foreign exchange and strengthen the power of resistance. The second is bristles. The output is the most abundant, reaching 20,000 boxes. There are two kinds, black and white. White ones have always only been sold to Japan. In the previous year, more than 16,000 boxes could be shipped, of which white ones accounted for more than 3,000 boxes. Last year, due to the impact of the war, two new bristle bleaching factories were established in Chongqing, which can directly sell to Europe and the United States, so that Japanese merchants will not be able to make profits in the middle. However, due to the drought, the output is less, and after the interruption of the Yangtze River traffic, the average monthly export value is only one-seventh of what it was before the interruption. Therefore, the total number of exports for the whole year is only 10,000 boxes, with a total value of 10 million yuan. It is said that recently, it has been possible to use the empty trucks when requisitioned vehicles set off to transport a lot of goods through other routes. The third largest export commodity is silk. In its heyday, Sichuan silk sold 20 million dan per year. Later, due to the depression in the international market, the silk industry in Sichuan also suffered a setback. In the previous year, the silk price even fell to more than 300 yuan per bundle. Last year, the Sichuan Provincial Government expanded and reorganized the original silk company and reorganized it into Sichuan Silk Industry Company. In the spring and autumn seasons, a total of more than 5,000 dan were produced, worth more than 2 million yuan. The total sales volume of Shun, Tong, and Yu gangs was also 3,000 dan, with a total value of more than 2 million yuan. After the interruption of the Yangtze River traffic, the transportation situation was less than one-fifth of what it was before. The fourth largest export commodity is medicinal materials. In the twenty-sixth year, the total business volume of medicinal materials in Chongqing was 6 million yuan, which was 1 million yuan less than in the twenty-fifth year. Last year, from the middle of the second month of the lunar calendar to the end of the year, it was only 5 million yuan, of which imported goods accounted for more than 1 million yuan and exported goods accounted for more than 3 million yuan. After the interruption of the Yangtze River traffic, the monthly transportation and sales volume was less than one-half of what it was before the interruption. (To be continued)

### My Outlook on Life and the Basic Theory of Our Engagement in Vocational Education (2) Huang Yanpei

The existence of countries in the world is based on various demands on life and the environment and their evolution. However, the innate condition is to serve the people. Therefore, there is a right path for political systems. Under the three essentials of government by the people, of the people, and for the people, appropriate settings are made. For those that do not match name and reality, there is only the removal of falsehood to seek truth. Perhaps abandoning everything and adopting dictatorship is because of being forced by some special environment and seeking the convenience of temporary coping. However, in political history, it can only be regarded as an abnormal organization in a certain aspect and a certain period, and placed as an exception. It is expected that when the function ends, it will naturally step onto the right track, and it can never be regarded as a permanent national law. As for social and economic systems, only under the overall interests of society and the country can the legitimate interests of individuals be safeguarded. Anything that relies on a special position to seek monopoly or over-occupation, forming injustice and unfairness, is not acceptable. After various evolutions of politics, the democratic system is proposed, and after various evolutions of the economy, socialism is proposed, which are all our beliefs. From the standpoint of the country, whether it is politics or economics, the principle is always to respect and safeguard the rights and interests of the people and concentrate and increase all forces to dedicate to the country, in order to complete its mission of creating strong and powerful individuals internally.

How to maximize the protection of the rights and interests of the people? The most effective method is to use an enlightened approach to make everyone understand the quality and extent of the rights and interests they should enjoy in addition to the obligations they should fulfill, and strive to obtain them, and cherish and exercise them. How to concentrate and increase all forces to dedicate to the country? The most effective method is to develop everyone's intelligence and use science to develop local and material resources. The key is to use an enlightened approach on everyone's daily work, that is, on the stereotyped actions of exchanging their mental or physical labor for the needs of life, to make everyone increase their intelligence, that is, to know and to act. And deeply understand its meaning, so that they know that the long life of mental and physical labor is not only for personal life, but to fulfill their sacred obligations directly to the group and indirectly to the country. Therefore, the power of the land and materials is increased because those engaged in development know the correctness and proficiency, and concentrated because everyone universally understands the great righteousness of pacifying and dedicating to the country, and the entire power of the country is strengthened because of this. There will be two major contributions in the meantime. Everyone's daily labor is recognized as a sacred obligation to the group, and because of the mutual induction of goodwill, everyone will also give more respect and kindness to the laborers. The wind of mutual strife and killing will gradually turn into mutual love and affection, which should not fail to be a kind of action to reduce human tragedy. Because their intelligence increases, the emphasis is on knowing and acting, so that thought and action are linked, and all their intelligence and talent are used in daily work, seeking to increase efficiency and constantly improving their work, promoting new inventions of things, which will contribute to the development of culture, so as to make up for the regrets of our country's lack of inventions and backward culture for two thousand years.

Based on the above understanding, we all seek the way to devote ourselves to it. There are many ways, but as we think about it, the so-called enlightened approach is to make everyone understand the obligations they should fulfill and the quality and extent of the rights and interests they should enjoy, and strive to obtain them, and cherish and exercise them, which is education. The so-called stereotyped actions of everyone exchanging their mental or physical labor for the needs of life is a profession. And using an enlightened approach to make everyone increase their intelligence, that is, to know and to act, and deeply understand its meaning, is vocational education.

Education, vocational education, are complex and varied. And its main contribution to the country is nothing more than this. The establishment of a country is complex and varied, and the basic conditions for cultivating strength are nothing more than this.

We have seen something and immediately try to do it. Even if it is just a corner, we must devote all our strength. If a small attempt is successful, it will be widely implemented, so there is no choice between ourselves and others. We know and immediately act, and do not take credit for success, to encourage others, and also to encourage ourselves. To seek the increase of work efficiency, we must gather like-minded people, the organization must be sound, the discipline must be strict, and the life must be orderly. We will not hesitate to work hard, because we are driven by our beliefs.

Based on the above principles of life, and the entire world view and outlook on life, our colleagues dare to generously shoulder such a great and arduous mission, believing that it is a necessary contribution to the country, and a necessary contribution to the world and all mankind in the initial stage. We have been engaged in it for many years. We respectfully express our innermost thoughts to ask for the clarification of those who know me. The purpose of vocational education was officially determined in the sixth year of the Republic of China, the year the Chinese Vocational Education Society was established.

1. Seeking the development of individuality.

2. Preparing for personal livelihood.

3. Preparing for personal service to society.

4. Preparing for the nation and the world to increase productivity.

December 20, 27th year of the Republic of China, Nanquan, Chongqing. (End)

London English Far East Company Stocks: The trading prices of stocks of various Far East companies listed on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday, January 31st, continued to rise. The stock of the Mercantile Bank continued to rise by five shillings, with a price of nine pounds, two shillings, and six pence. The stock of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation continued to rise by one pound, with a price of eighty-three pounds and ten shillings for those registered in London and eighty-five pounds and ten shillings for those registered in Hong Kong. The unregistered stock of the Kailan Mining Administration rebounded by one shilling, with a price of sixteen shillings and six pence. The stock of the Kuraclim Plantation Company rose by one shilling and three pence, with a price of eighteen shillings and nine pence.

Yesterday's securities gray market situation: All bonds are calculated ex-dividend market prices. After a period of hovering, they gradually rebounded. The market situation: Initially, it was full of suspicion and wait-and-see. The appetite of those who were long had reached saturation. Most sellers sold ex-dividend to avoid the trouble of monthly dividends, and bought back on small dips. In this shift, they had already received the full interest. At this point, the downward trend came to an end. The rebound was sudden. The contrast between the forenoon and afternoon was absolute. However, people are still skeptical about whether the rebound will continue. As the market rebounded slightly, rumors of full interest spread. The sluggish and stagnant situation in the morning remained unchanged. Both buyers and sellers were very idle, adopting a wait-and-see attitude, with no business. In the afternoon, No. 41 suddenly bought in at a low price. Tong Kang issued Bing into Jia, which was also very lively. Retail investors also bought more and sold less. This rebound was not a short covering but a temporary long position. Therefore, the rebound of one yuan and several angles in the afternoon seemed too rapid. The opening of Classes A and B ex-dividend shows a decline, which is not a fact. As a result, apart from Classes A and D opening ex-dividend, the market price rebounded by one yuan and one or two jiao. The volume of transactions was more than 500,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

The table shows that the opening prices of Classes A and D ex-dividend are lower than the dividend price.

Stock market conditions: The profits and losses of various firms varied, so stock prices also rose and fell differently. The business of the China National Goods Company was unusually developed. The stock, with a face value of 20 yuan, could not be bought even at a price of 28 yuan. There were rumors of two stocks being worth one stock. Thousands of shares of China Book Company were traded at a price of 24 yuan, up a few jiao from the previous day.

### Finance Cash Confidence Rebounds: Returning to 2020 Yuan Outside the Pass

Yesterday, the cash gold market's trading range remained narrow, but prices rebounded and strengthened. It is said that after foreign exchange received support from foreign firms, it softened, and the European situation eased after Hitler's speech, leading to a slight recovery in confidence. This rekindled interest in gold purchases among Hong Kong investors. An attempt was made to task a certain gold firm and a jewelry store to search for and purchase gold. Ultimately, with the help of jewelry stores, cash shops, and securities firms, the supply was steady, so the price increase was minimal, closing with a rebound of only three yuan. Overall confidence was slightly better than the previous day, with moderate trading. Gold jewelry remained stable, while customs gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to decline.

Hong Kong Investors' Interest in Cash Gold Rekindled

From the morning, the market opened with news that foreign exchange had softened after being supported by foreign firms, and a certain gold firm was showing strong interest in purchasing on behalf of Hong Kong investors. As a result, the opening price was raised to 2020 yuan per tael (ten liang). The gold firm then purchased 50 taels each from a securities firm and a cash shop, followed by 100 taels from a jewelry store, all at the same price. Shortly after, a jewelry store also purchased 50 taels from a cash shop on behalf of Hong Kong investors, again at the same price. Subsequently, it purchased another 50 taels from a fellow jewelry store for 21 yuan. The gold firm then purchased 30 taels from a jewelry store for 22 yuan. The gold firm again purchased 50 taels from a jewelry store at a similar price. After selling, the jewelry store immediately repurchased at the original price, acquiring 50 taels from a cash shop. Later, a money exchange also sold 50 taels to a jewelry store at the same price. Another money exchange purchased 50 taels from a jewelry store, still at 22 yuan. By then, it was already 11:00 AM. After this, both supply and demand became scarce, and the price remained stable. No transactions occurred until noon, so the closing price at noon remained at 22 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the lack of activity in the foreign exchange market, trading became even more sparse. Around 3:00 PM, only 50 taels were traded between money exchanges, still at 22 yuan. After that, the market became even quieter, so the closing price in the evening was no different from the noon price. As a result, the price increased by three yuan compared to the previous day. The cash shop's listed selling price for standard gold was 2030 yuan, and the buying price was 2015 yuan. The spot gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but no transactions occurred.

Gold Jewelry Remains Unchanged

The price of gold jewelry in jewelry stores remained unchanged due to the stability of cash gold. Large stores like Lao Qingyun continued to list the original price of 205 yuan per liang, while newer stores listed 203 yuan for selling and 197 yuan for buying.

Pound Sterling Strong, Pure Gold Continues to Fall

A London dispatch on the 31st stated that the price of British pure gold continued to fall because the pound sterling had strengthened since Hitler's speech. The price fell by another 1.5 pence per ounce, reaching £7 8s 6d. The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash also decreased to 1212.3 yuan. The listed price of customs gold also decreased by 3%, amounting to 2.394 yuan. The price of Shanghai standard gold also decreased by one yuan, amounting to 1207.6 yuan.

### Money Exchanges' Clearing Volume in the Past Two Weeks

—Around 12 Million Yuan—

Since the Shanghai money exchanges started including clearing transfers in the reserve pool exchange on January 16th of this year, it was initially considered a trial run and not disclosed. Even after this newspaper published the news, outsiders still mistakenly believed it was a bank clearing transfer exchange, even involving banks on the Bund, demonstrating the extent of the misunderstanding. Now, the clearing volume for the past two weeks since the money exchanges started handling clearing transfers themselves is disclosed below. However, this newspaper did not send anyone to the money exchanges' association to investigate these figures. The newspaper has its own way of gathering news. This is for the information of all parties. (Unit: Yuan) (0)

### Foreign Firms Increase Settlements, Foreign Exchange Returns to Tightening

Although the foreign exchange market received a continuous flow of telegraphic transfers from abroad yesterday, it tightened again due to the approaching Lunar New Year and increased settlements by foreign firms. Furthermore, the European situation remained internally tense despite external relaxation, and banks were not supplying smoothly. However, there were no special changes mid-session, and trading remained active. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate tightened slightly because money exchanges were not actively selling, and banks were absorbing the currency better.

In the early morning, the spread between near-term and forward London large bills continued to narrow, New York spot rates remained flat, London gold narrowed by 1.5 pence, the pound-to-dollar exchange rate increased by 1.3 cents, and the exchange rates against France and Shanghai remained unchanged. The dollar-to-pound exchange rate decreased by 4375, the dollar-to-franc exchange rate decreased by 125, and the dollar-to-Shanghai exchange rate decreased slightly by 0.02. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. At the opening, banks' selling price for the pound was 8 328125 pence, and the selling price for the dollar was 16.25 yuan, shrinking by 0.015625 for the pound and tightening by 0.03125 for the dollar compared to the previous closing price. After the opening, foreign firms first aggressively bought from American banks and Dutch banks at only 8 328125 pence for the pound, leading to a tightening of the situation. The pound tightened to 8 3125 pence, and the dollar softened to 16.1875 yuan. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was announced to be reduced by 25. Subsequently, telegraphic transfers poured in, and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation sold pounds to Dutch banks at 8 34375 pence and American banks sold dollars to the Hua Bi Bank at 16.28125 yuan, resulting in a slight rebound in the process. Later, foreign firms returned to purchase dollars from American banks at only 16.21875 yuan, and Italian, Dutch, and Anda banks bought Hong Kong dollars from money exchanges, narrowing from 56.125 yuan to 56 yuan, ultimately leading to a tightening of the situation. The closing selling price for banks at noon was 8 328125 pence for the pound and 16.21875 yuan for the dollar, resulting in a tightening of 0.015625 for the pound and a decrease of 0.0625 for the dollar compared to the previous closing price. The Hong Kong dollar softened by 0.125. In the afternoon, the market was quiet on Wednesday.

Sharp Increase in Demand for Foreign Currencies

Yesterday, British pure gold fell by 1.5 pence, and the British-American exchange rate decreased by 4375. Foreign exchange trading remained active, but bank supply was not smooth, indicating a weakening trend. The market was quiet on Wednesday afternoon. Cash gold supply and demand were balanced, and large transactions became rare. The afternoon market was even more depressed, showing a fluctuating trend. Foreign currencies were abundant and there was some hoarding. The foreign exchange market closed slightly weaker, and market prices became more firm. Most currencies tended to rise again. Demand for American dollar drafts increased, and French franc drafts were also strong, showing a firm trend. Trading at the exchange was still active. Yongtai sold and Hengmao bought 1000 yuan in American dollar drafts. Also, Huetong bought 10 British pounds from Letai. Letai sold and Santai bought 2000 yuan in American dollar drafts. Fusheng sold and Fuhexing bought 4000 francs in French franc drafts. Yesterday's market prices: the British pound increased by 0.2 yuan, the American pound increased by 0.3 yuan, the American dollar draft increased by 0.014 yuan, the Hong Kong dollar draft increased by 0.005 yuan, the French franc draft increased by 0.005 yuan, the Singapore dollar and the Dutch dollar each increased by 0.02 yuan, the Canadian dollar draft increased by 0.04 yuan, the Philippine dollar draft increased by 0.03 yuan, and the Italian dollar draft decreased by 0.015 yuan. The Australian gold draft increased sharply. Only the British gold draft, the Annam dollar, the Rupee, the German dollar, and the Siamese Tical remained unchanged.

Discount Rates Steady

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts tended to stabilize, hovering around 37 yuan per thousand yuan, ultimately settling at 37 yuan, with no change compared to the previous day.

British and Indian Silver Prices Weak

A London dispatch on the 31st stated that there was little market change due to limited buying and selling by speculators, and the market remained steady after closing. The spread between near-term and forward large silver bars continued to narrow by 0.0625. A New York silver dispatch stated that American silver prices remained unchanged. A Bombay silver dispatch stated that the Indian silver market was slightly weak, with both spot and near-term prices decreasing by 3 annas and forward prices decreasing by 4 annas.

### Silk and Tea Domestic and Foreign Silk Prices Rise Together

Yesterday, overseas silk markets, both in Japan and America, experienced sudden and rapid increases. Yokohama spot prices opened at 915 yuan in the morning and closed at 920 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 30 yuan compared to the previous day. Forward prices opened at 890 yuan in the morning and closed at 897 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 24 yuan. New York 83-day silk was sold at $1.99, up $0.05; 75-day silk opened at $1.93, up $0.03; Shanghai silk was at $1.89, up $0.05; Guangdong silk was up $0.01. Exchange prices for near-term increased by $0.04 and for forward increased by $0.045. Due to the feverish rise in foreign silk markets, the situation in Shanghai was even tighter. The price difference between foreign firms and domestic users reached 100 yuan. User White Factory original paper was sold at 1390 yuan, and Peace grade was sold at 1440 yuan. Wuxi small trucks have also been sold at 1350 yuan. Market sentiment is extremely enthusiastic, but although silk prices are rising daily, silk trading is not as active as it was the week before. In the foreign firm silk market, only India saw slightly more sales. Zhejiang reeled silk was traded at 760 yuan in the afternoon, up 30 to 40 yuan. According to January figures, the market price of Shanghai factory silk has increased by 140 yuan (at the beginning of January, the price of White Factory B grade was 1260 yuan, and at the end of January it had risen to over 1400 yuan). Foreign firm silk trading has been quiet for a long time, with only domestic user seeing strong sales. This is not a good outlet for factory silk.

516 pieces of silk were shipped to Europe in one day.

### Yarn and Cotton Yunnan and Guangdong Investors Active Again, Cotton Yarn Decline Stabilizes

Double Horse Warehouse Orders Still Being Pulled

Japanese Yarn Market Eases in February, No Transactions Yet

After several days of continuous decline in the yarn market, the situation stabilized slightly yesterday. At the same time, the Yunnan and Chaoshan investors showed healthier appetite, buying nearly 300 bales of coarse and fine yarn. Otherwise, there was no hope of improvement. However, some argue that in recent days, prices have fallen by 16 yuan from the peak, and although the Shenxin factories have released a large number of bonds, they are mostly futures and cannot be used as warehouse orders for the time being. Most of them are in the hands of financial institutions and there is no intention to release them currently. Therefore, no one is willing to cut their losses and are holding firm, which has slightly stabilized the weak market. Selling prices are uneven.

Checking the current yarn market situation, the market opened weakly in the morning due to sluggish actual sales and the approach of the Lunar New Year. Generally, there was a lack of desire to hold through the New Year, leading to the release of goods and a depressing market. Opening prices fell by 0.5 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 391.5 yuan. Hong Kong investors only bought 10 bales. After that, sales were sluggish and gradually decreased. Double Horse almost broke through the 390 yuan barrier. Subsequently, after someone pulled 200 bales of Double Horse yarn with warehouse orders, the closing price rebounded slightly. The current price of Double Horse yarn is still 392 yuan, with no change from the previous day. A total of 924 bales were traded in the morning, with inter-dealer trading accounting for two-thirds. As a result, the market prices for 20-count Double Horse were similar to the previous day, Tiannv fell by 0.5 yuan, Special Jincheng rose by 1 yuan, and Double Globe rose by 0.15 yuan. However, 18-count Tiannv fell by 1.5 yuan. The factory did not take any action. Yesterday, 135 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 590 pieces to Shantou, and 20 pieces to Hong Kong. The amounts bought by each investor group are listed below.

After the short-selling squeeze in the Japanese yarn market, the market eased substantially and prices continued to decline. At the same time, actual demand was extremely weak. The current price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 324-5 yuan, and the current price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 320 yuan. There have been no transactions for February yarn.

### Cotton Transactions Await Bull Market

Overseas Market Prices All Rise

The price of foreign cotton, and American cotton prices in particular, currently depend entirely on government cotton legislation and the sale of loan cotton. However, Congress is constantly wavering on this cotton issue, which is attracting worldwide attention, making it difficult to predict. This issue is indeed a serious global problem. Therefore, all operators are uneasy and waiting for developments in Washington. Yesterday, New York rose by 4 points. India, due to the sharp rise in New York forward prices the day before, rose by 2 rupees along with forecasts yesterday. Egypt is still closed. Exchange rates yesterday did not fluctuate much. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices all rose, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rising by 0.6 yuan per dan, Indian cotton rising by 0.09 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rising by 0.1 yuan.

Due to the imminent Lunar New Year, foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has become quiet. Moreover, yarn prices have not improved this week, so there may be no large-scale transactions this year. However, it is generally believed that yarn prices will improve next year when the bull market arrives, and foreign cotton trading will also have to wait until next year. Yesterday, there were still small transactions with Japanese factories. The transaction amounts and prices for yesterday are listed below.

Local cotton business remains stagnant, with no activity from any party, almost at a standstill. This is due to the approaching end-of-year accounting period, as cotton merchants prepare to close for the New Year. Trading is unlikely to develop further. In addition, prices have already risen to the point where there is no room for further increases. The factory, due to the recent sluggish yarn market and narrowing profit margins, has limited purchasing power. However, purchases of foreign cotton are still in full swing. The supply from Northern Jiangsu is becoming increasingly scarce. 846 bales of Tong cotton arrived, 54 pieces came from Youpu, 220 pieces came from Baimao, and 190 pieces came from Beisha. For exports, 170 pieces were shipped to Shantou, 90 pieces to Hong Kong, and 50 pieces to Beihai. The current cotton selling prices and transaction amounts are listed on the left.

### Grains Lower-Grade Flour Shipments to the North Show Activity, Wheat Prices Remain Stable

The flour market remained stable yesterday, with continuous small transactions from various investors. Southern investors added 5,000 to 6,000 bags of No. 2 flour, etc., while shipments to the North increased, with nearly 20,000 bags traded. "Tuzhong" and "Chechuan" brand No. 2 flour accounted for half of the transactions, with the remainder being No. 4 and No. 5 flour. The prices were 4.8 yuan for "Chechuan," 3.55 yuan for "Hong Liuhai," and 3.3 yuan for "White Bag." The market situation is unlikely to change significantly this year. Yesterday, 3,000 bags were shipped to Weihaiwei, 2,000 bags to Yantai, and 8,500 bags to Xiamen.

The supply of wheat remained limited yesterday, and costs were not particularly high. Factories, facing a shortage of imported wheat and persistent demand for domestic wheat, were unwilling to accept inflated prices, resulting in a cautious market. As a result, only one type of Northern Jiangsu high-gluten wheat was traded, with Fuxin and Fufeng factories each purchasing 1,000 bags at the original price of 6.55 yuan.

High-Quality Early Rice Market Active

Yesterday, the number of early rice arriving by military transport was small, with only 2,150 bags coming from Pei County. However, local retailers' appetites were strong, with shops, factories, and foreign buyers absorbing much of the supply early. As a result, over 1,000 bags were sold in the morning, followed by another 2,000 bags in the afternoon. The high-quality early rice, priced at 10.023 yuan, was particularly active. There were few transactions for higher grades. Nanjing early rice rose to 10.08 yuan. Higher grades of Wuhu early rice were not sold, while mid-grade rice rose by 0.1 yuan in the market.

Polished Rice Shows Revival, Shanghai Warehouses Full, Leading to Scarcer Supply

After a continuous decline, the domestic rice market rebounded yesterday, driven by full warehouses in Shanghai, which led to a decrease in supply from the interior. Only No. 3 rice arrived from Hexia, and only 1,000 to 2,000 bags of "Cheliun Baozi" rice arrived, leading to a revival in sentiment. The local market was quite active. However, because warehouses were full, hoarders were reluctant to buy, preventing a full recovery in the market. As a result, the price of thick japonica rice rose by 0.1 yuan after falling below market value, and the price of "Gaoke" rice rose only by a few cents. Due to the shortage of Hexia rice, thin indica rice rose by 0.1 yuan, while original-packaged rice remained largely unchanged. Consequently, the prices of "Duyang Jian" and "Bujian Jian" rice only improved slightly by a few cents. High-quality "Bian Yuan" rice was unchanged, while mid-grade rice showed a slight improvement of 0.1 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains Soybeans Exported: Over 500 Tons

Xiamen and Other Locations Continue to Purchase

The price of soybeans is usually determined by the price of train soybeans. However, since the start of the war, train soybeans have not been available. As a result, Chongming sand soybeans, which have a daily market, have become the standard for both buyers and sellers. Recently, the supply of this soybean has decreased due to environmental factors. The market has become more lively, leading to rising prices. However, yesterday's market saw a slight decline in demand. High-quality sand soybeans were priced at 7.7 yuan, while mid-quality soybeans ranged from 7.64 to 7.645 yuan. Xiamen buyers purchased over 600 bags from this area. Other transactions included 50 bags of Pinghu mid-grain "Du" soybeans, priced at 9 yuan, and 50 bags of Dalian soybeans, priced at 7.95 yuan. Shipments for export yesterday included 250 bags of soybeans to Dumen, 50 bags to Hong Kong, 421 tons to Bombay, and 101 tons to Colombo. In addition, 500 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Xiamen, 400 pieces to Shantou, and 1,640 cans of crude oil were shipped to Hong Kong.

Sugar Market Domestic Sugar Market Unusually Strong

Yesterday, the trend of Dutch sugar remained weak. The exchange set the price of No. 2 Dutch coarse white sugar for spot goods in foreign warehouses at the original price of 24 yuan, but there were few buyers. Re-exported goods were 0.2 yuan lower, at 15.6 yuan. The price of Taikoo "Che Bai" B grade sugar in Western warehouses fell to 23.6 yuan, and the price in Eastern warehouses fell to 23.5 yuan. Sellers were even more accommodating, fearing further softening in the market. On the other hand, the domestic sugar market trended differently, as production in various producing areas this year has decreased. For example, in Zhangzhou, where hundreds of loads were exported daily in winter, only dozens of loads are exported daily now. Furthermore, because domestic white sugar sells well, some are converting sugar production to white sugar, so green sugar is becoming scarcer. In Shantou, farmers are no longer rushing to Shantou to sell their sugar. If they are purchased directly in the countryside, prices are difficult to lower. Northern investors are stationed in Shantou to purchase sugar, so green, red, and white sugar are consistently strong. In Quanzhou, foreign investors have been buying, so land prices have been rising frequently. High-quality white sugar is being quoted at 26-27 yuan, and the prices of green and red sugar are also soaring. Yesterday, only seventy bags of Xinghua "Jue Bai" sugar were offered, priced at 18 yuan. Chao sugar was slightly re-opened, with no change. Over 100 bags of Huanggang green sugar were priced at 13.8 yuan. On the 31st, 1,100 bags of sugar were shipped to Ningbo.

Miscellaneous Items Star Anise Plummets by Four Yuan

Because it is expected that star anise will be available in mid-March and due to the end-of-year accounting, some sellers who do not want to hold the product for long are willing to sell at a loss. Yesterday, the market offered a price of 24 yuan, offering over 20 bags. However, even at this price, although not the bottom, it is unlikely to fall further as the arrival of new stock is not significant.

Northern and Southern Goods: Both Peaches and Lotus Seeds See Price Increases

Hand-picked peaches from within the pass have recently seen increased prices, reaching as high as 44 yuan, with sellers asking 46 yuan. The prices of other varieties ranged from 40 yuan to 26-27 yuan. Mingguang Lake lotus seeds have recently arrived, and their quality is good, so the selling price has been raised to 40 yuan, an increase of 5-6 yuan. Hunan lotus seeds remain stable with no changes. Local lotus seeds are priced at 125 yuan, and other varieties are priced at 120 yuan. Top-grade white lotus seeds are being quoted at 100 yuan, and stock is scarce.

Coal and Charcoal Coking Coal Sales Plunge

Down By As Much As Fifty Yuan

Recently, because the foundries in Shanghai have mostly stopped working due to the approaching end of the year, coking coal sales have been severely affected. Inventory has piled up, and the market is depressed. Recently, the black market price was only 170 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan. Demand remains weak, and the trend seems likely to continue. It is said that most outside hoarders currently holding inventory have suffered significant losses, which was unexpected.

### Piece Goods Approaching End-of-Year Accounting, Ordering Gradually Cools

Factory Goods More Expensive in the Future

Domestic cotton cloth from Zhejiang and Fujian is currently in low demand, as various investor groups need to reconcile their accounts due to the approaching end-of-year accounting period. The ordered goods are still being shipped as planned, but new orders have become intermittent. The market is average, and the momentum remains tight. Factory prices for future deliveries are more expensive than current prices. Local dealers are also unwilling to sell at a loss. Demand from Southwest, Sichuan, and Yunnan investors remains strong. Yunnan investors have ordered nearly 200 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, bleached twill, lining, cotton, colored twill, and printed fabrics. Sichuan investors have also ordered 1,000+ pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, cotton, printed fabrics, and satin. Wen and Yong investors from Zhejiang have ordered over 200 bales of Yihe coarse cloth for next month's delivery at 0.1 yuan above the market price. New orders are rare, and only orders for colored cloth and colored twill are still being processed. Hong Kong investors have ordered 30-40 pieces of dyed grey fabric and fine twill. Local wholesalers have purchased 56 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, and coarse twill for bleaching and dyeing.

Yesterday, the market price of fine cloth and fine twill from Dong Cloth continued to decline. This is because the actual sales to the customer are gradually decreasing as the close of the business year draws near, resulting in increasingly weak spot prices. In the morning, the price of Longtou fine cloth fell to eleven yuan and eight jiao, then a Shanghai color cloth firm rose to absorb the stock with a single order for 200+ pieces. Other fine twill, fine cloth, and other factories searched for around 1000 pieces of dyed blank cloth. In the afternoon, the market turned bullish and the price rebounded slightly, resulting in a fall of one jiao per bolt of fine cloth/ fine twill compared to the previous day. However, the futures market remained stable and did not ease. The ratio between the market list and the spot list was a difference of 4-5 jiao per piece. Therefore, the offer of goods from various firms was said to be uninteresting.

Inspection of Piece Goods exports yesterday showed 20 pieces shipped to Xiamen, 10 pieces to Shantou, 2 pieces to Hong Kong, 300 pieces to Yantai, and 70 pieces to Tianjin.

Seafood New Bombay Shrimp Tails Arrive

Dried Shrimp and Glass Fish Arrivals Also Lacking

New Bombay shrimp tails have recently started arriving, but the quantity is small. Yesterday, a firm offered high-grade shrimp tails for 106 yuan and secondary-grade shrimp tails for 87 yuan. Quality quite dry.

Arrivals of Yantai dried shrimp have been lacking for a long time. Sales have been continuous on a small scale. Currently, ordinary goods are sold for 60 yuan, so the trend is stable.

Zhejiang glass fish from Zhoushan is even more scarce. Ningbo goods require 34 yuan. The market will need to increase by 1-2 yuan later.

Hardware American Narrow Strip Steel Widely Sold

American narrow strip steel is being heavily purchased by Tianjin investors. Local canneries are also showing good appetite. As a result, 400-500 boxes are being offered daily. The market price for assorted colors is 43-44 yuan per box. The market price for single sizes is 42 yuan for 2-inch to 4-inch, and 45-48 yuan for 5-inch to 8-inch. Yesterday, over 1,000 boxes of new goods arrived at the Kung Wo Cheung, Kee Chong warehouse, etc. It is said that factories have already disposed of half of them. Because overseas prices have been rising sharply in recent days, local confidence is strong, and no one is willing to sell much. The market is not expected to ease easily in the near future. The previous day, 460 pieces of lead and 800 pieces of nails were shipped to Ningbo.

### Japanese Airplane Lands in Jiading, Burned by Guerrilla Unit, Forced Landing Due to Mechanical Failure, Pilot Visited the Next Morning and Only Remained the Shell

The Zi Lin paper said that yesterday (31st) afternoon, news was revealed in Shanghai, a Japanese Airlines biplane forced landed near Jiading on Monday (30th). Guerrilla fighters active in that area searched the plane thoroughly and burned it. The three Japanese crew members were all safe. It was found that the plane was a four-seat commercial transport plane, which took off from Nanjing at 2:30 PM on that day. Ten minutes later, the engine malfunctioned and the plane was forced to land in a rice field 10 kilometers southeast of Jiading. The three Japanese crew members left the plane and went to the nearby Japanese garrison for help. They then met some Japanese soldiers, intending to return to the landing site, but because it was already dark, they did not go. Yesterday morning, they went to the landing site again and found that the plane had been searched and burned.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Protection of Domestic Goods, Strict Prevention of Japanese Goods Posing as Domestic

Order number Chuan Gong Zi 14885 from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, ordering the Construction Departments of the provincial governments and the consulates in Nanyang, etc. states that, "The rules for issuing certificates of origin for domestic goods, promulgated by the Ministry, were revised and announced in September of the 27th year. Currently, in extraordinary times, the government should broadly provide certificates for, and protect, domestic goods manufactured by domestic factories. At the same time, the government should strictly prevent Japanese goods from posing as domestic goods in order to maintain the interests of legitimate manufacturers. To ensure that these measures are widely known, in addition to separate orders, a complete set of rules for issuing certificates of origin for domestic goods is enclosed for local Chinese newspapers to publish, in order to broadly disseminate this information. This order is issued.

### Miscellaneous Grains and Their Products, Exempt from Transit Tax, From Number 45 to Number 54

Now, sugar bran, buckwheat, sorghum, corn, millet, soybean cake, cottonseed cake, peanut cake, vegetable seed cake, other seed cakes, unnamed miscellaneous grains, wheat flour, and unnamed miscellaneous grain flour, etc., from number 45 to number 54, are all allowed to be tax-free to show consideration. All customs offices have been ordered to comply.

### City Residents Form Fundraising Committee: Standing Committee Meeting Resolves Several Important Cases

### The Vanguard Army Engages in Fierce Battle at Changshu; Company Commander Yu Sacrifices Himself for the Nation; Struggle for the Shizhuang Bridge in Wuxi; Japanese Casualties Exceed a Dozen, Eventually Retreating

According to people from Changshu, the 5th Company of the Independent Detachment of the 4th Regiment of Commander Zhong Bingyan's unit of the Second Vanguard Army in Jiangnan, Third War Zone, was recently transferred to Xiyang near Fushan in Changshu. At dawn at the end of last month, they encountered over 200 Japanese soldiers coming from Changshu City. Company Commander Yu Shitang bravely led the charge and was unfortunately killed after being struck by several bullets, sacrificing himself for the country. Six soldiers also died in action at the same time, and four were seriously wounded. The situation was critical at the time. Fortunately, after hearing the news, the regimental headquarters, led by Commander Zhong, surrounded the enemy in several directions, and after four hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese were defeated. After the battle, it was found that four Japanese soldiers had died, and a local civilian, Xu Caidong, was also unfortunately killed by a stray bullet. Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 25th, the unit under Deputy Commander Gao Zugao engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese at Shizhuang in Wuxi. The two sides fought across the Xicheng Canal. The Japanese used small mortars and launched grenade assaults. During the struggle for the Shizhuang Bridge, Gao Ahong, the squad leader of the special task force under Gao's unit, led a charge but was unfortunately killed by mortar fire, and three soldiers also died, with five wounded. The Japanese side suffered more than a dozen casualties and retreated towards Tangtouqiao in Jiangyin in the evening after skirmishing until nightfall.

### Customs Increase, Five Branch Offices Added, Some New Japanese Customs Officers

Regarding the forced increase in Japanese customs officers at the Jianghai Customs and the subsequent establishment of customs branch offices, this reporter has learned that the new customs branch offices established by the Jianghai Customs were established today. A total of five branch offices have been added: North Railway Station, Jessfield Road near Caojiadu, Hongqiao Road in Xujiahui, and the other two are roughly in the Hongkou area, one being a key location for goods transported by road to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line, and the other being the Suzhou River. The customs offices at these newly established branch offices are now mainly staffed by Western customs officers, together with Chinese customs officers, and newly added lower-ranking Japanese customs officers. According to sources, the establishment of these customs branch offices was indeed triggered by the addition of lower-ranking Japanese customs officers, which caused a public outcry. However, the establishment of customs branch offices is also sufficient to prevent and investigate the smuggling of goods into the interior for dumping. However, the Japanese demand for more senior customs officers was repeatedly rejected by Tax Commissioner Rocher due to customs regulations. However, the Japanese side continued to demand, and Rocher, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, stated that he had no authority to handle it and transferred it to the Inspector General of Customs for processing.

### Escorted by British Warships, Yongzhen Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Heda and Hafa Delay Departure Due to Insufficient Coal, Seized Legal Tender Returned After Negotiation

The three foreign freighters seized by Japanese warships and customs patrol boats at Yanghekou on the 27th of last month and forced to sail to Qingdao have all been released successively after negotiations by the British and Norwegian consuls. The Yongzhen arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 yesterday morning. The Heda and Hafa delayed their departure due to insufficient coal and telegraphed to delay until last night or this morning to leave Qingdao. The legal tender seized by the Japanese side has also been returned after negotiation. Details are as follows:

British Warship Escorts Yongzhen to Port

The British freighter Yongzhen of the Shanghai Yongli Shipping Company, along with the Heda and Hafa, was seized by Japanese warships and Qingdao customs patrol boats at Yanghekou on the 27th of last month and forced to sail to Qingdao. Subsequently, the British Consul-General lodged a protest and sent the British warship HMS Hynam to Qingdao for protection. The Japanese side released the ship first on the morning of the 30th. Then, at around 9:00, escorted by a British warship, it sailed directly back to Shanghai and arrived at Pudong Longmao Warehouse at 10:00 yesterday morning. According to crew members of the freighter, the forced seizure of the Yongzhen and other three freighters and sailing to Qingdao had no legal basis. Fortunately, the British Consulate lodged a reasonable protest, and the British warship was dispatched for protection. Therefore, although the Yongzhen was searched in Qingdao, the silver and banknotes it carried were not detained.

Heda and Hafa Delay Sailing to Shanghai

A reporter from the Modern News Agency learned from the Subei Joint Transportation Company yesterday that according to a telegram received by the Norwegian Consulate, the Heda and Hafa were released at 11:00 the day before yesterday after negotiations by the Norwegian Consul in Qingdao. They originally planned to sail to Shanghai immediately, but the coal carried in the ships had been used up and could not be started. The Norwegian Consulate notified the Mitsui Coal Yard in Qingdao to add coal, but the docking was slightly hindered due to wind in Qingdao port, resulting in insufficient coal loading and a delay until last night or this morning to set sail for Shanghai, arriving in port the day after tomorrow.

Seized Legal Tender Returned After Negotiation

After the Heda and Hafa arrived in Qingdao, they were illegally searched by the Japanese side, and all the silver and legal tender carried by the two ships from Fuyu to Shanghai were seized, intending to confiscate them. According to a telegram from the Qingdao Consulate, regarding the seized silver and banknotes, the Norwegian Consulate continued to negotiate, and all legal tender has been returned in full. However, regarding the confiscated silver, the Japanese side claimed that it would only be returned after verification.

HMS Poulo Also Escorted to Shanghai

The British freighter HMS Poulo, which was detained by the Japanese side in Qingdao the other day, was escorted to Shanghai yesterday by a British warship. The British naval authorities have protested to the Japanese side and stated the reason for the detention of the British ship. The Japanese side has agreed to submit a reply today. According to the captain of the HMS Poulo, the ship was loading goods near Haizhou together with two Japanese ships, when a Chinese customs patrol boat and two Japanese destroyers sailed over and ordered it to sail to Qingdao. It was released only one day later. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, it immediately notified the British Navy, and the British warship HMS Birmingham, which was stationed in Weihaiwei, was ordered to sail to Qingdao and escort the HMS Poulo to Shanghai.

### Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Route Still a Temporary Measure, Formal Sailing Only Permitted After Inspection and Certification, Tangsai and Meida to Sail to Shanghai from Ningbo Today; Unification of Freight Rates Still Under Negotiation

Since the Headquarters of the Tenth Army Group promulgated revised measures for navigation in eastern Zhejiang, no longer prohibiting direct routes between Shanghai and Ningbo, the Moufu, Xin'anna, Liangzhou, Deping and other ships have all implemented direct sailing to Ningbo. However, this direct route is temporary. Formal long-term sailing is only permitted after the completion of measurement and registration procedures. The Sino-Italian Company stated that it has not yet made a formal decision on the unification of cargo freight rates. The Tangsai and Meida, vessels on the Ningbo fixed route, have telegraphed that they are scheduled to sail directly to Shanghai today, and will also implement direct routes between Shanghai and Ningbo. Details are as follows by a reporter from the Modern News Agency:

Direct Route Still a Temporary Adjustment

In the past, the military authorities in Zhejiang Province strengthened national defense forces, so they directly blocked the Yong River, prohibiting navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo. After requests from various parties, they only permitted routes via Wenzhou and Taizhou, and continued to prohibit direct routes. It was only recently that revised measures for navigation in eastern Zhejiang were promulgated, allowing Shanghai and Ningbo to resume direct routes. Therefore, the Moufu, Xin'anna, Liangzhou, Deping and other ships have all implemented direct sailing to Ningbo. However, according to reliable information obtained by a reporter from the Modern News Agency from the shipping industry yesterday, although direct routes are now permitted for each ship, it is still temporary. This is because the Ningbo authorities recognized that there was a large backlog of local products, and with the approach of the end of the year, they adopted a flexible approach to regulate the rural economy. However, each ship is limited to two or three trips. At the same time, during the direct route period, they will carry out measurement procedures and apply for a certificate with a limit of more than one year of sailing. If they get approval, they can sail permanently, otherwise they will still be prohibited from sailing.

Tangsai and Meida Sail to Shanghai from Ningbo

The Tangsai, of the American-owned Huamei Company, and the Meida, of the Portuguese-owned Meili Company, originally sailed on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. However, on December 26th of last year, they were ordered to stop sailing to Shanghai, so they specialized in the Ningbo-Taizhou route. The Tangsai sailed to Fujian some days ago to load goods once, and returned to Ningbo yesterday morning. The Meili Company received a telegram from the Ningbo branch yesterday reporting that the Meida is scheduled to sail directly back to Shanghai from Ningbo today (2nd), and asked the Shanghai company to prepare goods for transportation to Ningbo. Judging from the meaning of the telegram, it should be that the Ningbo side has agreed to join the Shanghai-Ningbo route. The Tangsai is also scheduled to sail to Shanghai from Ningbo today, and will probably also join the direct Shanghai-Ningbo route, and that after the Moufu opened to Ningbo, it returned to Shanghai yesterday and will arrive in port this morning.

Freight Rate Issue Still Under Negotiation

According to the person in charge of the Sino-Italian Shipping Company, the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping freight rates were re-negotiated by the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Sino-Italian companies on May 1st of last year, and were appropriately increased compared to before the war. Later, the Shanghai-Ningbo route was prohibited, and the Sino-Italian ships stopped sailing in compliance with the order. As for other shipping companies, there may have been special circumstances, and they were still able to sail. As a result, the increased freight rates were excessively high compared to the publicly determined prices last year. After the Ender and Deping were approved to sail from Wenzhou to Ningbo, in order to reduce the burden on passengers, they still charged the previously determined freight rates, and did not arbitrarily lower them. Yesterday (i.e., the 31st), representatives of the three companies gathered to discuss unifying freight rates, but it was only an exchange of views and not a formal meeting, so there was no decision.

Merchants Eagerly Hope to Reduce Shipping Costs

The Ningbo merchants in Shanghai believe that with the recent restoration of direct Shanghai-Ningbo routes, shipping freight rates should be appropriately reduced in accordance with the wishes of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to reduce the burden on merchants and facilitate the transportation and sale of local products. It is heard that they will jointly submit a request to the Ningbo Association and the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, who will inform the three companies for review. According to a leader in the customs declaration industry who spoke to a reporter from the Modern News Agency, before the war, Shanghai-Ningbo shipping freight rates were only 7.6 yuan per ton for general cargo, 0.42 yuan per load for miscellaneous grains, 1 yuan per load for oil, 0.46 yuan per load for sugar, 0.1 yuan per bag for flour, and 3.11 yuan per piece for golden silk grass. However, after the war, the various shipping companies raised prices one after another without any restrictions. After opposition from various parties, the new tariff of the three companies was set on May 1st of last year, but it was still three times higher than before the war. At present, the various companies have a proposal to maintain the previously set freight rate list. The customs declaration industry believes that it is still too expensive, so they hope that it can be appropriately reduced.

### Large Export of Inland Rice Grains Will Affect Food Supply in Shanghai; Reduced Arrivals Cause Continued Rise in Rice Prices; Central Government Implements Control of Reserve Military Grain

The Japanese side is seizing rice grains in large quantities in the occupied inland areas and shipping them for export. At the same time, the North and South Ocean gangs are also directly purchasing rice grains from various producing areas along the Yangtze River for transshipment, resulting in a sharp decrease in inland reserves. It is expected that there will be a food panic in April and May of this year when the harvest is not in. For the sake of long-term resistance against Japan, the central government has taken control of grain producing areas in various provinces, and local government organs have been placed in charge. Shanghai rice prices continue to increase. Details are as follows by a reporter from the Modern News Agency:

Large Exports Reduce Reserves

The Japanese side is using its special power in the inland areas to seize rice grains at low prices in the rice-producing areas of various counties in Jiangnan and ship them for export. If the people slightly disobey, they will be detained and killed. Therefore, they dare to be angry but dare not speak out, and are left at the mercy of traitors. Also, since the Shanghai authorities restricted the transshipment of rice grains, the various gangs have been directly purchasing from various producing areas along the Yangtze River, such as Wuhu, Zhenjiang, Changyinsha, Hupu, and Jiaxing, Pinghu, and Songjiang along the inner Yangtze River line. The number of those directly transshipping each month is very large. At present, inland reserves have decreased. Even farmers who plant more fields can only store one or two dozen loads of rice grains after the autumn harvest, which is only a few percent. Under this situation, it is expected that there will be an extreme panic of rice grains in April and May of this year.

Shanghai Rice Prices Continue to Rise

The arrival of inland rice in Shanghai recently has decreased by 30-40% compared to October and November of last year. The daily arrival is currently 6,000-7,000 bags, while the Shanghai consumption for civilian food supply is more than 11,000 bags per day, with a daily deficit of 3,000-4,000 bags. Based on the current stock of 700,000 bags of rice in Shanghai, it can only maintain the people's food supply for four or five months. Therefore, the current market rice price continues to rise due to increased sales, numerous inland taxes, and rainy weather, among other reasons. With the Lunar New Year approaching, rice prices are unlikely to fall.

Grain Reserves Under Provincial Control

Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek decided to store ten years of military and civilian grain to prepare for a long-term resistance against Japan, the provincial governments have followed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's instructions to implement measures to control the production and sales of grain. According to sources from the Modern News Agency, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have already started to conduct a thorough investigation of the amount of grain produced in various provinces, counties, and districts, and reward farmers for production. All newly harvested rice grains this year will be purchased and stored by the government at an assessed price, and absolutely prohibited from being transported to the Yangtze River area.

### Report of Reorganization of Tianjin Bank of Communications Not True, Tianjin Branch Operating as Usual, No Other Changes

The report that the Tianjin Bank of Communications had been reorganized and managed by the "United Reserve Bank" after the puppet government repeatedly lowered the value of legal tender has been denied by the bank's authorities and branch personnel. The Tianjin branch is still operating as usual and there have been no other changes.

### Ministry of Economy Negotiates Regulations; Japanese Forcefully Control Certain Areas; Zhejiang Provincial Government Recognizes Shanghai as Not a Controlled Area; Wenzhou and Ningbo Customs Telegraph Inspector-General for Instructions

After various provincial governments and customs authorities were ordered to investigate and prohibit the transportation of 54 types of goods to Japan, its colonies or mandated territories, and areas forcefully controlled by the Japanese, the Ministry of Economy is currently conducting a detailed investigation and consulting with relevant agencies to determine the "prohibited transportation areas forcefully controlled by the Japanese." Local customs authorities generally prohibit the transportation of the above-mentioned goods to Shanghai, believing that since Shanghai fell, everything has been under Japanese control. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that, although the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that Shanghai has not been forcefully controlled by the Japanese and has not been designated by the Ministry of Economy as a prohibited transportation area, all local goods such as paper are allowed to be transported and sold according to the original plan. However, the tax commissioners of the Zhejiang Ningbo and Wenzhou customs have telegraphed the Inspector-General of Customs for instructions and will proceed with handling the matter after an explanation.

The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy, saying, "Regarding the case of the prohibited transportation of materials to the enemy, the Zhejiang Customs issued an announcement on the last day of January, and designated cotton, tea, paper, eggs, and other items as major export products of eastern Zhejiang. Once these items are prohibited from transportation, millions of people will be cut off from their livelihood. We have already sent a letter to the Zhejiang Customs to postpone implementation, and also telegraphed your ministry for instructions in the You month, and also presented a request through the First Inspection Team of Military Discipline in the War Zone of the Military Affairs Commission, and telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission to instruct the customs to allow the shipment of goods for export. Later, according to the Ning Shao Paper Distribution and Sales Office, we received a telegram from Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government stating, 'The list of prohibited transportation materials to the enemy announced by the Zhejiang Customs refers to the prohibition of transportation to enemy countries and their colonies or mandated territories, and areas that have been forcefully controlled by the enemy. Since Shanghai has not been forcefully controlled by the enemy and has not been approved by the Ministry of Economy as a prohibited transportation area, all paper can still be transported and sold according to the original plan. Please comply accordingly.' Therefore, it is undoubtedly clear that Shanghai is not a prohibited transportation area, as clearly stated by the Zhejiang local authorities. However, the Zhejiang Customs does not allow exports because it has not received instructions from the ministry. Now, the commercial settlement period is approaching, and stopping transportation for one day will result in huge losses, and both livelihoods and finance are affected. We earnestly request your ministry to promptly instruct the Zhejiang Customs to allow the usual transportation and export of all kinds of goods from Ningbo to Shanghai, so as to maintain livelihoods and strengthen finance. We are anxiously awaiting your instructions."

### Yu's Unit of the Chinese Army in Pudong Forbids Occupation of Civilian Houses to Prevent Japanese Troops from Setting Fires

The Japanese troops in Pudong have been repeatedly attacked by guerrillas, and they are furious. They often resort to setting fire to civilian houses and killing innocent people as a retaliatory policy. Yu's unit of the Chinese army in Nanhui has issued a general order to the Gu, Yan, and Li battalions, instructing their subordinates to uniformly prohibit the occupation of civilian houses in the future, so as to prevent the Japanese troops from having any further excuses. Therefore, the various units have successively moved into public institutions or group schools and temples. Other units are also preparing to move, so as to prevent the Japanese side from succeeding in its poisonous scheme of pressuring the masses to report the whereabouts of the guerrillas.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Schedules Taxpayers' Meeting for April 19th Afternoon

The Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council recently decided on the dates for the election of council members and the annual meeting of taxpayers at its board meeting. The date for the election of council members for this year has been set for April 12th (Wednesday) and April 13th (Thursday). As for the annual meeting of taxpayers, it is scheduled for April 19th (Wednesday) from 2:30 PM, and will still be held at the Grand Theatre.

### Coolidge Delays Departure One Day Due to Anchor Chain Entangling Propeller; Hired Divers to Saw it Off

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The American President Line's Coolidge arrived in Shanghai from America on January 31st. It was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong and Manila at 5:30 AM on February 1st. At around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, the ship was prepared to depart. After the Japanese pilot boarded the ship, the engine was started. At that time, the sailors were also reeling in the anchor chain tied to the buoy. Among them, there were three anchor chains tied to buoy No. 11. Two of them had already been reeled in, and the remaining one could be reeled in within a few minutes. Suddenly, the stern of the ship slightly retreated, bringing it closer to the buoy. The anchor chain became entangled in the propeller, and the ship's engine could not be started. It was late at night, and the sailors had no way to rescue the situation, so the scheduled departure was delayed. At dawn, the shipping company hired craftsmen from the Rui Rong factory to try to repair it and sent divers to inspect it. It was found that as many as ten coils of the anchor chain were entangled in the propeller. At first, it was originally planned to remove the anchor chain, but after six or seven hours, there was no success. Later, it was decided to saw off the anchor chain. By about 4:00 PM, it was heard that five coils had been sawed off, and the rest would continue to be sawed off, so that it could be completed that night, so that the ship could depart for Hong Kong as usual at 6:00 AM this morning (the next day). It is heard that the ship's loss for being stranded in Shanghai for one day will be more than 10,000 yuan, and the passengers on the ship are extremely anxious.

### The Collapsed Tiger Cart Trade Petitions; Chinese Directors Express Sympathy and Agree to First Request the Authorities to Release the Detained Vehicles

The Municipal Collapsed Tiger Cart Trade Mutual Aid Society, yesterday expanded its effort to request the Municipal Council to accept the society's proposal to terminate the extension of the stub axle replacement. It dispatched more than ten representatives to petition each Chinese director, and notified those whose vehicles were detained and unable to work, to temporarily endure hunger and starvation, and not to panic. The details are recorded below:

Expanded Petition: Yesterday morning, the council of the society appointed representatives Zou Shisong, Ke Huaxin, Wu Zhengyuan, Hong Ruqin, and more than ten others, along with the society's general managers Ge Futian and Gao Youyu, at 10:00 AM, first delivered a letter to the Sanbei Company, the office of Director Yu Qiaqing, and then to the Jingxing Building, the office of Director Xi Yushu, to petition, stating various difficulties and proposing three points, requesting that they lead them to personally request the Municipal Council's General Manager, Mr. Felippou, to accept and make flexible arrangements. At 2:00 PM, they went to the offices of Directors Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, and Guo Shun to make the same petition, and decided to send representatives again today to appeal to various organizations in the city for sympathy and assistance, and to make a unanimous request to the Municipal Council to achieve their goal.

Questions Arise: According to the person in charge of the society, speaking to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, the Municipal Council should have considered the society's request to cancel the stub axle replacement agreement, as it was petitioned twice to the Bureau on January 16th and 20th. However, recently, it suddenly believed that the number of licensed rickshaws had exceeded 10,000, and that the opposition was only a minority, so it changed its attitude and firmly refused to accept the society's request. However, according to the society's investigation, most of the military vehicles that have been licensed to the Municipal Council are unqualified, and there are serious questions about how the licenses were issued. The truth of the matter needs to be investigated. Therefore, when petitioning yesterday morning, they solemnly declared to the Chinese directors, requesting that they forward it to Mr. Felippou, the General Manager of the Municipal Council, and pay attention to it.

Notice to Members: Since the 29th of last month, the police stations have been implementing inspections, and according to reports to the society, more than 100 vehicles have been detained. The society's members are panicking due to the suspension of work and the impact on their livelihoods, and have been repeatedly requesting the society to negotiate for relief. However, due to their lack of knowledge and the nature of their lives, their attitudes are very impetuous. The society is sincerely afraid that its members will cause trouble and violate the law. Yesterday, it issued a notice to its members, roughly stating that during the negotiation period, it is inevitable that the police will detain vehicles. However, coolies are ultimately subject to control. If they are too impatient, they will not only fail to gain the sympathy and understanding of the Municipal Council, but may also be considered to have violated the law and suffer unexpected pain. Therefore, it is hoped that all rickshaw owners whose vehicles have been detained and who cannot work, will temporarily endure hunger and starvation, and wait patiently for the Chinese directors to mediate and seek a reasonable solution.

Petition Situation: When the society's representatives petitioned the Chinese directors yesterday, the Chinese directors agreed to mediate. When the society's representatives set out to petition in the morning, all the rickshaw owners whose vehicles had been detained, and the rickshaw pullers who had not obtained licenses, followed them on the road, numbering more than 300. The society's general manager, Ge Futian, fearing that there would be too many people and that unexpected incidents would occur, immediately explained and guided them, and ordered Zhang Baosen, Lu Jinhong, and four others to be representatives and accompany the petition. When they arrived at the office of Chinese Director Xi Yushu in the Jingxing Building on Ningbo Road, South Henan Road, they dispersed, showing the rickshaw pullers' panic.

Chinese Directors Meeting: The society originally hoped that Directors Yu Qiaqing and Xi Yushu would lead them to meet with the General Manager of the Municipal Council to make a request. However, because there were too many rickshaw pullers following them, fearing misunderstandings at the Municipal Council, and because Director Yu Qiaqing had a cold and was not convenient to be disturbed, the original proposal was cancelled halfway and they did not go to the Municipal Council. After the Chinese directors were petitioned by the society's representatives, they all believed that the hardships of the laborers should be resolved. They gathered at the Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday afternoon to discuss and decide to first request the authorities to release the detained vehicles in order to stabilize the livelihoods of the coolies. Regarding the termination of the extension of the stub axle replacement, the Chinese directors also believed that it was indeed a reasonable request.

### Foreign Ships Docking in Quanzhou; Protected by Their Own Country's Navy; Subject to Inspection by Customs and Military Police; The National Government is Not Responsible for Attacks by Japanese Warships

The National Government's Military Affairs Commission has designated Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Hanjiang in Fujian as navigable ports. To maintain the commerce of friendly nations, it has stipulated regulations for foreign ships' traffic and inspection. All three navigable ports have been blockaded, and foreign ships are specially allowed to dock outside the blockade line. Now, the Fujian Provincial Government has specially designated that friendly foreign ships, such as those docking at the port of Quanzhou, must be protected by their own country's navy near the Tapu Island outside the blockade line. Barges loading and unloading goods must submit to the military authorities for approval and be subject to inspection by customs and military police. When departing, they must obtain a visa from the customs and the military authorities stationed at the blockade line. The National Government is not responsible for attacks by Japanese warships on friendly ships and barges, whether inside or outside the blockade line.

### Chinese Team of the Merchant Corps; Shixia Cup Finals; Small Target Shooting Competition; Li Yushu Wins the Championship

Mr. Chen Shixia, the battalion commander of the Chinese Translators Team of the Shanghai International Merchant Corps, has been in office for seven years since the "January 28th" Shanghai War. He is highly respected by his colleagues for his serious management, effective training, cooperation between superiors and subordinates, and fair arrangements. As a result, the team's performance has been improving and outstanding. When the team celebrated its 30th anniversary two years ago, Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Zhi, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Chinese Team Association, presented a large silver cup to the team leader as a reward, named the Shixia Cup. The team leader declined with humility, and then donated it to the Chinese team members as a competition prize. It was stipulated that all team members who were fully present throughout the year would be eligible to participate in the competition as an encouragement. The intention was very good. It is reported that the first final competition was held in the Municipal Council training hall on the 25th of last month and at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The competition was small target shooting, with scores for hitting the bullseye, the moon target, and slow fire, with and without a rest, for a total of 20 shots, with a total of 80 points. After the competition on the 25th, Shen Linshu was the best. Yesterday was the final, and the competition was very intense. As a result, Mr. Li Yushu shot 72 points and won the championship, Mr. Zhou Qingen was second with 68 points, and Mr. Shen Linshu was third with 65 points. The trophy went to Mr. Li. The prize was awarded by Mrs. Chen, the team leader, amidst enthusiastic applause and cheers from the audience.

Both gatherings were very lively.

### A Record of Visiting the Jewish Refugee Residence; A Primary School in Hongkou is Converted into a Dormitory; Everything is Available and There is Even a Theater

The China Press reports that it was recently rumored that 1,000 Jewish refugees were coming to Shanghai. The reporter asked Mr. Spielman, the chairman of the European Jewish Refugee Committee, who said that he was also shocked by the news. The Shanghai people donated funds, clothing, and other items to the committee, so the refugees who have already come to Shanghai can still be taken care of. But when this large number of refugees comes to Shanghai, the committee will not be able to meet even half of their needs. The reporter was then led by several members of the committee to the

Refugee Residence:
across from the Western Prison on Huade Road for a tour. The place used to be a primary school. A month ago, it was allocated by the Municipal Council's committee to accommodate refugees. It has now been converted into a dormitory that can meet all the needs of the refugees. Two weeks later, the construction will be completed and it will be able to accommodate 1,200 people, including a hospital, a theater, a dining hall that can accommodate 200 people, and places for making clothing and shoes, which will be operated by the refugees themselves and serve only the refugees living there.

The converted dining hall
can also be used as a classroom. Double-decker iron beds have been placed in the bedrooms. The hospital, which is about to be completed, has isolation wards and a pharmacy for dispensing medicines. According to a committee member, the place will temporarily accommodate single men. When other places are completed, women and children will also be accommodated. The monthly cost of food and lodging per person is about 17.50 yuan. Currently, there are approximately

Two Thousand Three Hundred Jewish Refugees
in Shanghai. Four hundred of them are self-sufficient, so the remaining 1,900 have to be taken care of by the committee. Judging from the current situation, in addition to the 1,000 refugees who have already left Italy and are on their way to Shanghai, it is expected that another 1,000 people will come to Shanghai in the next month or so. Representatives of the two committees in charge of refugees are scheduled to meet this afternoon (the 1st) to discuss how to cope with the influx of a large number of impoverished people. The large number of refugees who arrived in Shanghai on the Italian mail ship Contessa on Sunday (the 29th) had to temporarily live in the

Jewish Church
on Museum Road, sleeping on straw mats on the floor, with two meals a day. A large number of other refugees are temporarily living in the Riverside Mansion. The committee is currently leasing suitable houses in the Hongkou district to meet the needs that will be encountered soon. Although the committee has been making every effort to find jobs for the refugees in China, so far there has been little success. This is a very difficult point for the committee.

### Former Russian Tax Collector in Beiping Comes to Shanghai; States the Circumstances of Being Slandered; The Puppet Authorities Accuse Him of Being Connected to the Communist Party and Order Him to Leave the Country; He Himself Has Never Been Involved in Politics and It Is Not Worth Refuting

The Continental News reports that Gu Nuofanlov, former advisor to the Chinese government and recently the Customs Commissioner in Beiping, and his wife, were accused of being directly connected to the Communist Party in Tianjin and were ordered to leave the country. After leaving North China on December 31st of last year, they arrived in Shanghai on the 7th of this month, but it was not until a few days ago that they met with reporters. He denied all the allegations made against him in North China. The reason why the Tianjin "authorities" arrested Mr. Gu was

to implement a release
, because it was alleged that Mrs. Gu often went to the Soviet Union, "apparently as a communication agent between Moscow, Leningrad, and the capitals of Germany, France, and Sweden." In addition, the "authorities" also claimed that Mr. Gu had a relative named Zhdanov, who was an important worker in the Communist Party in Moscow, Soviet Union. As far as is known, except for Andrei Zhdanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and Secretary of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party, there are no

public officials
in the Soviet Union holding important positions with the name Zhdanov. Yesterday (the 31st), Mr. Gu stated that he not only had no relatives related to Andrei Zhdanov, but that he and his wife had no relatives named Zhdanov. Since coming to China from the Soviet Union in 1924, he and his wife had never returned to the Soviet Union, and he himself had never been in contact with politics. The accusations against him and his wife were

absurd and unfounded
and not worth refuting. Many of his friends can testify to this. It is reported that Mr. Gu joined the Chinese Customs in 1897, first working at the Yichang Customs as a fourth-class assistant, and was then transferred to the Beiping Customs. At that time, a special customs school was established in Beiping, where Mr. Gu taught Russian. In 1900, he was appointed as the personal secretary of Sir Robert Hart, the founder of the Chinese Customs. Three years later, he was transferred to the Yingkou Customs as the Customs Commissioner. After the Japanese occupied Yingkou, he

returned to Beiping
as the Customs Commissioner. In 1907, he participated in the negotiations between the Chinese and Russian governments on establishing a customs office in Harbin. When the Harbin Customs was established, Mr. Gu was the first Customs Commissioner. In 1910, when the Chinese delegation negotiated the 1881 treaty in St. Petersburg, Mr. Gu served as the delegation's technical advisor. Later, he served as an advisor to the Beiping Administration Bureau of the Chinese government. He retired in 1928, stayed in Beiping for five years, left China for Europe, and returned two years later. He decided to come to Shanghai to retire in the south of France.

### The Japanese Occupy the Chinese Merchants' Tram; Preparing to Resume Operations for Profit

After the Japanese occupied the Chinese Merchants' Tram Company in Nanshi, after many days of repairs, all the factories and vehicles have been tidied up and painted. They are now training a group of inexperienced and foolish people to drive the trams, and plan to resume operations on the main lines during the New Year to make a profit.

### Southwest Cotton Production Expands; Henan and Shaanxi Seeds Distributed to Various Provinces; Cotton Production Gradually Increases Thereafter

The Chinese government is making every effort to promote cotton production in the southwestern provinces to meet the needs of the yarn factories and people who have moved inland. It has distributed 7,000 seeds of cotton from Henan and Shaanxi provinces to the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. By the end of last year, the cotton-producing area in Sichuan had increased to 540,000 mu, Guizhou to 42,000 mu, Yunnan to 81,000 mu, and Guangxi to 12,000 mu. Cotton production in various provinces will gradually increase thereafter, and the results will be considerable.

### Jardine Matheson's New Ship; The "Mingsheng" Arrives in Shanghai; Invites All Sectors to Visit; Invitations Have Been Sent

Jardine Matheson, a British company, has developed its shipping business in recent years. In addition to building the Taisheng and Yongsheng ships in Hong Kong last year, it also purchased four new ships from a certain company in Hong Kong, the Yisheng, Hesheng, Xinsheng, and Mingsheng. These four ships were built in the UK, with solid hulls and novel designs. Except for the Mingsheng, the other ships have arrived in Shanghai one after another to join the north-south shipping lines. It is now reported that the Mingsheng has also completed its painting and departed from Hong Kong the day before yesterday, arriving in Shanghai tomorrow morning (the 3rd) at 7:00 AM, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf on Xinkai River in the French Concession. The company is scheduled to invite guests and colleagues to visit in the afternoon of the 3rd. Invitations have been sent out yesterday.

### The Postal Bureau Resumed Yesterday; Small Parcel Post to Shaanxi and Gansu; Personal Small Parcels Also Accepted; The Weight Must Not Exceed One Kilogram

The Joint Dispatch Group for Small Parcels of the Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice yesterday, stating that from now on, small parcels of medicine sent to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, those containing fully packaged medicines, and personal small parcels (limited to genuine personal small parcels; commercial small parcels sent by postal companies on behalf of others, even if they bear personal names, may not be accepted for delivery) can be resumed. However, each parcel must not exceed one kilogram. This is hereby announced. It is reported that the fee is three yuan per kilogram.

### "Aspirin" Is Not a Common Trademark

The Chinese National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association and the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association previously submitted an application to register six trademarks, including "Aspirin," by Dade Paint Factory. At the time, the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was requested to re-evaluate on the grounds that the scope of use of each trademark was unclear, or that it was a commodity name, and could not be exclusively used according to law. Now, the Trademark Bureau has issued No. 92.

Re-evaluation Letter:
still maintaining the original ruling that "the request of the requester can be established." The reasons are as follows: The only reason for the requester's request for re-evaluation is that the (Aspirin) and the Chinese "Aspirin" trademarks have become commonly known drug names and are common trademarks, and have lost the special distinctiveness that trademarks should have, violating Articles 1, Section 2, and 14, and Article 2, Section 5 of the Trademark Law.

The respondent's reasons
roughly stated that the trademark in dispute was created by them, and that the trademark is known to a part of the Chinese people because of their efforts in promotion. Therefore, the key to resolving the case lies in investigating whether the trademark has become a common trademark. According to the fact that a trademark is a coined term at the time of registration, it is known to the general public in society because of the efforts of its owners in operation and promotion, and its distinctiveness is not reduced.

Its Exclusive Rights
cannot be restricted or prohibited as a result. It is obvious that trademarks known to the general public cannot be confused with the "commonly used trademarks in custom" stipulated in Article 2, Section 5 of the Trademark Law. The so-called "commonly used trademark in custom" refers to a trademark that anyone who operates the same product

can use
and is in fact commonly used. Because it is recorded as commonly used by the industry, the law allows one person to adopt it as a trademark, obtain exclusive rights, and prohibit others from citing it. The "Xuefang" trademark case cited by the requester is completely different from this case. The word "Xuefang" has long been in the custom of the Dongyang ham industry.

Common Trademark
Therefore, it cannot be exclusively used by anyone. The "Aspirin" trademark in this case was created by the respondent, which is an undisputed fact and has been registered according to law for many years, obtaining exclusive rights. The requester failed to provide evidence to prove that the trademark is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry, and only stated that it is known to the general public and emptyly claimed that it is a "commonly used trademark in custom," which is not sufficient to adopt. Based on the above conclusions, the requester's reasons for the request cannot be established.

Municipal Council 1938

### Police Report (1)

Last year, there were a total of 43 incidents of clashes between police officers and armed bandits. One police officer died and six were injured. Ten bandits died and 18 were injured.

There was no difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel. The general level of newly recruited personnel has been fully maintained. There were still not enough Western police officers, and future recruitment will be done locally as much as possible within the scope of possibilities. A total of 193 newly recruited personnel were trained and assigned to duties, including 133 Chinese, 14 Westerners, and 20 Japanese. Among the newly employed Western personnel, 31 were recruited locally. Various review courses on management, transportation, security duties, and drills for Chinese and Indian constables were continued throughout the year. The discipline, conduct, and health of all police officers were satisfactory.

A total of 3,823 pieces of ordnance used by the police officers were repaired in the armory, which did not cost much. No defects were found in the firearms used in the clashes with the bandits.

The effectiveness of the reserve team has been fully maintained at its high level. Last year, the team went to 27 places where bomb cases occurred, one factory where riots occurred, 20 places where bandits robbed, and two places where gun battles occurred. It also assisted in the arrest of armed bandits in two cases. In addition, it was responsible for guarding, searching, patrolling, guarding, and protecting.

At the end of last year, the mounted patrol隊 had seven large horses and 39 small horses.

There were a total of 507 special police officers. Twenty-seven new ones were recruited and 91 resigned. The special police officers at all levels held two pistol shooting exercises with excellent results. The special police officers were ordered to be on duty on various commemorative days last year, and the efficiency was good.

The telegraphic printing machine is still in use, and the overall effect is very good. Street telephones are also an effective tool for transmitting police news. Patrol cars equipped with wireless radios have not been used due to insufficient personnel allocation. However, when reserve team vehicles patrolled, they still used wireless radios to communicate with the police station. Some of the armored vehicles of the merchant corps have also been equipped with wireless radios, which makes communication with the police more convenient.

At the beginning of last year, there were 154 refugee camps in the Public Concession, accommodating a total of more than 90,000 refugees. In addition, there were no less than several thousand refugees living in empty houses in the alleys. Later, some of the refugees were sent back to their hometowns, and some camps were merged, so by the end of the year, the number of camps had been reduced to 68, accommodating 50,000 refugees. Various public organizations and charitable organizations in the city continued to raise funds to help the refugees. There were 21 factory strikes, less than one-sixth of the number in the previous year, affecting more than 6,000 workers and losing more than 27,000 working days. There were no strikes in the first quarter of last year, one in April, and an average of two or three in each of the remaining months. The factories where strikes occurred included 10 silk weaving factories, 2 printing factories, and 3 cigarette factories. In addition to strikes, there were 23 recorded labor disputes, mostly due to disputes over dismissal, wage reduction, and payment of severance pay. A total of 25 people were arrested throughout the year for striking or inciting labor unrest. The industrial sector in the city suffered severely due to the war, and a large number of workers were unemployed. A small number of factories resumed operations at the beginning of last year, employing some workers. Later, the state of the industrial sector improved day by day, and more and more factories resumed operations.

The city's residents' food problem was quite serious at the end of the previous year. Fortunately, foreign rice was imported to remedy the situation. After April last year, the source of rice became more abundant, and there was no need to worry about food for the people. The average rice prices last year were as follows: First-class domestic rice, 13.66 yuan per dan; medium, 12.59 yuan; ordinary, 11.45 yuan; Saigon rice, 8.3 cents per catty.

### Intense Gunfire at Xin Kang Li: Geng Shoubao Shot and Killed; The Deceased Was a Shameless Collaborator Whose Evil Deeds Were Numerous; Over Ten Men Fired More Than Forty Shots, Stray Bullets Injuring Six, One Fatally and One Severely

Geng Shoubao, a local resident, 32 years old, currently residing in a bungalow at 491 Kang Nao Tu Road, a road built outside the concession in western Shanghai, relied on his relationship with Lu Ying, a disciple of the then-Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Squad Leader, before the war in Shanghai. Through this connection, he managed to obtain the position of captain of the Second Squad of the Detective Division of the Caojiadu branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. At that time, Geng immediately abused his authority, taking advantage of the special circumstances to exploit the people, colluding with Lu Ying to amass wealth through extensive extortion. He also recruited many followers and cultivated a private clique, thus establishing a significant evil influence in the Caojiadu area. At that time, the authorities were planning to bring him to justice, but unfortunately, the war broke out, and the matter was shelved. Soon after, both Lu and Geng lost their jobs. Unexpectedly, after the Chinese army withdrew, Lu Ying became insane and shamelessly served the enemy, accepting the position of "Police Bureau Chief of the Shanghai Dadao (Great Way) Municipal Government," a puppet regime. Geng Shoubao also took the same position at that time, appointed by Lu as the "Detective Squad Leader" of the puppet "Police Bureau." After accepting the puppet mandate, Geng Shoubao relied on his numerous accomplices to intensify his evil deeds, committing all kinds of atrocities. Furthermore, seeing the recent prevalence of gambling and opium dens in western Shanghai, he resumed his old tricks, providing protection and engaging in extensive extortion. Although he had only taken office for less than two months, his skillful methods allowed him to accumulate a considerable amount of money. At the same time, Geng Shoubao was aware that he had made many enemies and was wary, so he hired four bodyguards to serve as his guards, accompanying him whenever he went out, thinking that he could rest easy from then on. Unexpectedly, the more he tried to prevent trouble, the more quickly it came. At about 7:45 yesterday morning, Geng, dressed in a Western suit, left his home, intending to go to the puppet "Police Branch Bureau" to "work." As he was passing Xin Kang Li on Kang Nao Tu Road, he suddenly noticed more than ten men acting suspiciously in that area, rushing toward him from behind. Knowing that something was wrong, he immediately turned into a gambling den near Dasheng in Qi Kang Li to seek refuge. After about twenty minutes, Geng thought that the pursuers had left, so he came out again. Unexpectedly, the plotters had increased in number. As soon as they saw Geng Shoubao emerge from the alley, more than twenty people each drew their guns and fired at Geng. At that time, the sound was like a string of beads, and bullets flew like rain, reaching over forty shots. Geng Shoubao was shot down to the ground. Because he was hit by eleven bullets, all in vital areas, he died immediately. All the murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, immediately scattered and fled without a trace. At the same time, six pedestrians, unable to avoid the attack, were also injured by the bullets. Among them, an old man unfortunately died on the spot. In addition, Zhu Kaoer from Jiangyin, 44 years old, was hit by three bullets, injuring his hands, feet, and legs; Lu Zishi from Chongming, 55 years old, was hit by one bullet, injuring his right hand; Yu Guoyun, a five-year-old child from Ningbo, was hit by one bullet, injuring his left foot; Sun Guohuan from Shaoxing, 27 years old, was hit by one bullet, injuring his right hand; Wang Xi'en from Zhenjiang, 30 years old, was hit by one bullet, injuring his throat. For a time, cries of pain filled the air, and the road was stained with blood. At this time, the Gordon Road Police Station received a report. The Chinese Detective Chief Zhu Mengwei led detectives to the scene to investigate. At that time, Geng's body had already been taken away by the puppet "Dadao Municipal Government" vehicle. The wounded were sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. It is reported that Wang Xi'en was severely injured and his life was in danger. In addition, the detectives found more than ten bullet casings nearby, as well as a leaflet bearing the name "China Youth Anti-Traitor Corps," which read "Strike Down the Traitors." These items were brought back to the police station for filing, while investigations into the case began. Therefore, whether Geng's murder was related to political affairs or revenge remains to be reported.

### Dispute Over Leased Ship: Closing Arguments Concluded, Verdict Pending; Police Lawyer Believes Defendants Committed Fraud, Requests Severe Punishment According to Law

The Yi Tai Shipping Company had previously leased the Minhang-registered ship from the Min Nan Shipping Company. After the withdrawal of the National Army, the ship was detained by the Japanese. Later, it was freed through various means, and the flag was changed. It continued to operate as usual. Until November of last winter, Zhu Yousong and others formed the Dade Shipping Company and leased the ship, intending to operate on coastal routes. Yi Tai learned that Dade intended to change the flag again, which violated the lease agreement between them and Min Nan. Cao Hongyi, the manager of Yi Tai, negotiated with Zhu Yousong, and both parties agreed to terminate the lease. The 4,000 yuan in legal tender received from Dade as ship rental was settled with a promissory note. At that time, Luo Wanxiang, the owner of the Dagong Customs Brokerage, established a Hankou Shipping Company and appointed Shi Guangchang, a Suzhou native, as manager. He leased the ship from Cao, and a dispute arose when Luo paid the rent. Luo accused them of fraud and reported them to the police. The police arrested Shi, Cao, and Wu Chaohua, the former manager of Yi Tai, Ma Chengbeng, the owner of Yuan Tai Heng Weaving, and Huang Zhichu, a ship broker, who were also involved in the fraud, and brought them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. At this time, Zhu Yousong filed a complaint against Cao for fraud and sued all the shareholders of Yi Tai for damages. Judge Zhong conducted investigations, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing continued. The reply from the Jianghai Customs regarding the court's inquiry about the ship's whereabouts had been sent to the court, stating that according to the report of an Italian merchant, the Wan Na-registered ship was bought back by the original owner, Min Nan Company, on December 12. On the 15th, the ship suddenly left its original berth and its whereabouts were unknown. Judge Zhong then continued to question Luo Wanxiang about the issue of the flag when the ship was rented and set sail. According to Luo, it was not necessary to fly the Japanese flag when sailing to coastal ports, but it might be necessary to have relations with the Japanese in order to be allowed to sail. However, although there was a letter from Shi Guangchang to him stating that the cooperation with the Tianli Shipping Company had not been finalized, Luo still insisted that it had been. After being questioned by the court, Shi Guangchang stated that after the ship was leased, it was decided to join Tianli for cooperation, so the pass was also obtained from the Japanese army by Tianli. All these matters were instructed by Luo, and he, Shi, handled them on behalf of the Hankou Company as manager. Later, because the pass could not be obtained, he sent a letter to Luo resigning from his position. As for the fact that the ship was indeed handed over by Cao on December 6, Cao Hongyi also continued to provide details, saying that when Shi Guangchang and Chen Defu first came to discuss the lease, they said they were sailing to coastal ports. He immediately told them that the Dade Company also wanted to lease the ship to sail that route, and to change to the Japanese flag, which he would not allow and would terminate the lease. Shi and others then said that they were leasing to sail to coastal ports and would never fly the Japanese flag, so they began negotiations. Unexpectedly, a few hours after the ship was handed over on the 6th, two Japanese suddenly boarded the ship to change to the Japanese flag. After negotiations and prevention, the Tianli pass could not be obtained, etc. The court believed that the case was clear and ordered the closing arguments to begin. First, Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, stated that the facts of the case confirmed that the defendants had colluded in fraud and requested that they be punished according to law. Then, the lawyers for the defendants defended, all arguing that Luo Wanxiang was cunning and did not want to be seen as a traitor, so he used Shi Guangchang as a front. Later, he intended to destroy the deal and made this preemptive accusation, requesting that all defendants be declared innocent and that the civil lawsuit filed by the two plaintiffs be rejected, etc. As a result, the defendants were remanded in custody, and a date was set for the verdict to be announced.

### Seduction of Dancer An: Improper Jurisdiction, Second Special Court Refuses to Accept

Yang Lingmei, a girl from Ningbo who used to work as a dancer in the mainland ballroom, 17 years old, formerly residing at 32 Fangjia Alley, Daxi Road, a road built outside the concession in western Shanghai, was seduced by Zhu Xiasheng (19 years old), a neighbor and fellow villager who worked as a waiter at the Hollywood Ballroom, around the spring of this year according to the lunar calendar. After the seduction, the girl's parents moved out and opened rooms in the Zhongnan Hotel and the Chunjiang Third Inn, continuing to have sexual relations and making a lifelong commitment to marry her. On October 7, the girl's sister, Yang Shenghong, found her and took her back. Zhu personally wrote a statement agreeing to marry Yang. Later, Zhu regretted his decision and married another woman, neglecting Yang. Yang's mother, Yang Lu, as her legal guardian, hired a lawyer and filed a criminal complaint of seduction and abandonment against Zhu Xiasheng in the First Special Court. The defendant, Zhu Xiasheng, also hired a lawyer to argue the issue of jurisdiction. Judge Yuan opened a hearing and ordered Zhu to pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan, setting a deadline for further questioning. The details were reported in this newspaper on the 24th of last month. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liao continued the hearing. Both parties and their lawyers appeared in court. After questioning both sides about the location of the crime, which was in the road built outside the concession, the court announced the judgment that the jurisdiction was improper. The proceedings of this case must wait until the Nanshi Court resumes operations before they can continue.

### Abuse of Maidservant: Xu Xue氏 Released on Bail Awaiting Verdict; Maidservant Temporarily Sent to济良所

Xu Xue氏, a woman from Qingpu residing at 3, Lane 264, Hart Road, her husband, Xu Wenda, works at the telephone company. Two years ago, Xue氏 spent 50 yuan to buy a 12-year-old Ningbo girl, A Jin, as a maidservant to do all the work. Yesterday, the中華慈幼恊會 suddenly received a report letter stating that Xu Xue氏 had repeatedly abused the maidservant, beating her with wooden sticks, and requesting rescue. The Association immediately instructed staff member Liu Wenlin to report to the 静安寺 Police Station according to the information and instructed Chinese detective Qian Guobin to investigate and arrest Xu Xue氏, along with the maidservant A Jin. The girl was sent to 廣仁 Hospital, and it was found that her left arm had bruises and both hands had frostbite, so she was sent to 济良所. Xu Xue氏 was detained and sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan filed charges of injury according to Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and described the case. He also cited the maidservant A Jin's testimony that she had been beaten by the mistress with a stick before serving as a maidservant in Xu's house because she did not do her work well, but she was not usually beaten often. When questioned, the defendant Xu Xue氏 stated that she learned that A Jin went out the other day and hung on the streetcar, so she persuaded her not to do so. She was disobedient, so she slightly beat her, etc. She also hired Xu Yin 律师 to defend her in court. After Judge Liu verified the供词, he announced that the defendant would be released on bail of 100 yuan and postponed the verdict to this Friday. A Jin was temporarily sent to 济良所 for custody.

### Director of Nanshi Fu Shun Tang Shelter Embezzles Funds and Deducts Food Rice and Winter Clothing; Ren Linsen Has Been Dismissed and Is Under Investigation

There is a Fu Shun Tang Shelter run by a礼敎所 in Nanshi, Nine Mu Di. The Tang first opened when Shanghai south fell, with several branches, and accommodated a large number of refugees. Initially, the person in charge was Ren Xipeng, a staff member of the Tang. Later, Ren was attacked, so Ren's son took over. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Military Police Headquarters stationed in Nanshi recently received a complaint from a large number of refugees accusing Ren's son of deducting food, embezzling winter clothes. The Japanese reported the matter, and on the morning of the day before yesterday, they ordered several Japanese soldiers to go to the Tang with the Shanghai International Refugee Relief Committee to search the premises. They found more than 1,000 pieces of unissued winter clothes and dozens of dan of refugee rice on the spot (the refugees' food rice in each shelter is领到 from the Relief Committee every day and must not be left over to the next day in order to prevent abuses). Ren's son, the person in charge, and the seized winter clothes and food rice were all taken away. Since the case occurred, the International Relief Committee has attached great importance to it.

Ren Linsen of Shanghai Fu Shun Shantang in the Nanshi refugee area, under the guise of Shantang, set up a donation register and solicited donations from all walks of life. Most of the money and goods raised went into his own pockets. The puppet police authorities in Nanshi, based on a secret report, sent personnel to search and arrested Ren Linsen of the 社. He is now under close investigation. At the same time, Father Rao, the founder of the refugee area, believing that Ren Linsen also served as the district chief of the Seventh District of the area, could not avoid deducting the refugees' clothing and rice, ordered the headquarters to dismiss Ren and cancel the name of the Seventh District. All refugees in the district's shelters were transferred to other districts.

### Two Escaped Prisoners Healed and Interrogated; Sentencing Set for the 8th

Murderer Liu Yuepo from Taixing threw a bomb at Hualong Elementary School on Hualong Road on the afternoon of March 4 of last year, causing student Yin Xingyuan to be injured and die. Liu was arrested on the spot and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution. After three trials in the Higher Branch Court and the Supreme Court, he was sentenced to twelve years in prison. During the retrial appeal period, he was detained in the bald head of the detention center attached to the Second Special Prison on Masnan Road. Wang Shaoting (from Fengyang, Anhui), a robber, was sentenced to seven years in prison for his crime. He was held in the same prison cell as Liu. Unexpectedly, on the night of November 23 of last year, taking advantage of the guards' negligence, Liu and Wang sawed off the iron bars in the prison cell and fled. The guards discovered this and reported it to the competent department and requested the 法警务处 to send detectives to arrest them. At dawn the next morning, the detectives arrested Liu and Wang at Liu's home at 100 Macau Road in western Shanghai and at the entrance of the Luban Road Continental Alley and brought them back to the police station. Because the two criminals were injured when they jumped over the wall to escape, they were sent to廣慈 Hospital for treatment. The case was transferred to the Second Special Court, and the administrative authorities of the French Concession filed a public prosecution based on the crime of destroying the detention facilities and escaping according to the Criminal Law and requested an extension to wait for the two criminals to recover before questioning them again. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Because the injuries of Liu and Wang have fully recovered, the hospital notified the Police Department to take them back into custody. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Minsheng of the Second Special Court came to the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Yuan Jiahong, the lawyer representing the administrative authorities of the French Concession, described the case and the articles of the indictment. Liu confessed that Wang designed the escape. When Wang was questioned, he admitted that they had planned the escape together. Wang also admitted. After verifying the confessions, the court announced the end of the trial and set the sentencing for the 8th. The two defendants were returned to custody.

### Murder Case Over Extortion: Trial Concluded, Verdict Pending; Defendant Denies Committing the Crime

The thug Chen Along, at 8 PM on December 27 of last year, together with his accomplices, went to the middle厢房 on the ground floor of 66 Ruifu Alley, Zilaihu Street in the French Concession, to extort money from Xu Bingsheng (nicknamed "Blind Ah Fu"), a Wuxi native who sold morphine. A verbal altercation and quarrel ensued. There were no electric lights in the room, only a 洋烛火 which was blown out. In the darkness, Chen was stabbed in a vital area with a sharp knife and died on the spot. The murderer and Chen's accomplices, seeing that they had caused a disaster, all fled. Later, the French Police Department sent detectives to arrest Xu Bingsheng, his mistress Xu Wu氏, and suspect Shao Rongbao. It was found that Xu had been sentenced to one year and four months in prison by the First Special Court for a morphine case in previous years. He was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Shao Rongbao and Xu Wu氏 were found to be unrelated to the case and were released first. Only Xu Bingsheng was indicted for murder. The deceased's daughter, Li Zhang氏, hired a lawyer to file an incidental civil lawsuit, stating that the deceased Chen Along, also known as Li Along, was killed innocently and demanding damages and funeral expenses totaling 20,780 yuan, etc. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The day before yesterday, Zhang Minsheng, together with Prosecutor Wang Ren, continued the hearing and appointed lawyer Wang Shizong to defend the defendant. The police detectives presented the sharp knife, iron rod, and iron ruler, which were found in the defendant's home after the incident, as evidence. When questioned, Xu denied selling morphine, stating that the deceased bought a package of morphine from Xiao Suzhou, but he did not feel well after consuming it and came with several people to argue with Xiao Suzhou. A verbal altercation, quarrel, and fight ensued. He was suffering from a fever and chills, and when he saw them fighting, he hid under the bed. When he came out after they left, the deceased had been stabbed to death. He did not use a knife to commit the crime, etc. At this point, the court believed that the case was clear and ordered the closing arguments. After the prosecutor's opinion, lawyer Gu Shouxi of the French Administrative Authorities and the defendant's defense lawyer debated, and the court announced the end of the trial and set the verdict for the 6th. The defendant was returned to custody.

### Macau Road Robbery Case: Five Robbers Arrested

At 8:20 PM on the day before yesterday, the home of Yu Xiaozhang at 43 Macau Road was suddenly invaded by several robbers, who brandished pistols, threatened them to remain silent, and robbed them of valuables worth 180 yuan and 5 jiao before fleeing. The victim reported the incident to the Putuo Road Police Station, requesting an investigation. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Chief Feng Baishun, Detectives Yuan Xinzhong and Zhang Youming, and Detective Zhang Changkun arrested three local robbers, Ding Maotou, Ding Zhaosheng, and Ding Zhanggen, at 156 Pushanli, Gordon Road. It was learned that they had conspired in a room at the Changhua Hotel on Fujian Road beforehand. Detective Chief Feng, together with Western detectives, rushed to the hotel and arrested two more women, Ding Wu氏 and Ding Chen氏.

### Shanghai Bao Repeatedly Publishes Obscene Text: Kuang Menghuai Fined Again; Kuang Declares Disagreement and Files an Appeal

The small newspaper "Shanghai Bao" at 36 Meirenli, Hankou Road, was sentenced to fines three times by the court last year for repeatedly publishing obscene text. The content of the novel "顚鸞艷影記" published in the newspaper on the 8th and 9th of last month was extremely obscene. The工部局's Political Department filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court according to law. On the 25th of last month, the Special Court sentenced Kuang Menghuai, the editor of the newspaper, to a fine of 300 yuan. However, Zhang Yi, a detective from the Political Department, found that the newspaper had repeatedly published "捉刀六記" and "天津小姐" by Zhang Qinglin from January 14 to 16. There were also elements that offended public morals. Therefore, lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the工部局's Legal Department filed a complaint with the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Fang Qinghuan opened the Fourth Criminal Court and ordered Kuang Menghuai to appear in court. Kuang stated that the Police Department had not warned him beforehand and that the newspaper had stopped publishing the stories related to public morals after receiving the court's summons. Therefore, he had no intention of committing a crime. Moreover, it was a continuous act and he had already been heavily penalized, which he could not afford. He requested the court to investigate. Judge Fang核稟 and announced the judgment that Kuang Menghuai repeatedly disseminated obscene text and would be fined 300 yuan. If he was unable to pay, he would be forced to work. Kuang declared his disagreement in court and stated that he would file an appeal.

### Eating Habits of Famous People

— Yisu

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek likes to eat roast pigeons. When he was in Whampoa, he often went to Taiping Restaurant in Taiping Sha for a big meal. Ye Chucang likes peanuts and enjoys drinking. Five years ago, he competed with British Ambassador Lampson in drinking. As a result, Ye fell drunk after 54 cups, while Lampson also fell unconscious after drinking 55 cups.

Dr. Ma Junwu is very fond of cigarettes. Mr. Feng Yuxiang, on the other hand, is the opposite. When he ruled the Northwest Army in the past, one day he went to the office of Secretary-General Wei and felt the smell of smoke. Feng pretended not to know, but recited aloud: "Your house is smoky and smelly, smelly and smoky, both smoky and smelly, both smelly and smoky, smoky and smelly, smelly and smoky, smoky and smelly, also smoky and smelly, also smelly and smoky." After speaking, he turned his head and left. Mr. Wei was ashamed and quit smoking.

The late philanthropist Wang Yiting always puts the remaining matchsticks after smoking in the matchbox and is reluctant to throw them away. When others smoke and strike a match, he uses the matchsticks to ignite the cigarette.

Mao Zedong likes to eat oranges, Wang Chonghui likes to eat lean oil porridge, and Zhu De likes to eat steamed buns and large pancakes.

### Clothing Outside Clothing

— Shuangxi Yiye

Suits have always had overcoats. If you wear a suit without an overcoat, it's like a fledgling bird, with a shabby look. That kind of awkward taste of relying on others everywhere, or thinking of the "strong grass" in "Strong Wind", is not easy to find. In fact, overcoats are sometimes not for keeping warm, but mostly for maintaining appearances.

At present, in addition to the Chinese gown, it is also popular to wear an overcoat. This clothing outside clothing is naturally much more magnificent in appearance, but in reality it seems a bit like "a donkey in tiger skin." However, the general trend is that it seems that this garment cannot be less.

Friends all say that clothing outside requires clothing—an overcoat. Without an overcoat, it seems that the function of wearing clothes has not been fully realized. Therefore, for overcoats, most people who pay attention to clothing must make a final struggle. In fact, why bother, really, why bother.

"Reducing clothing", if you want to express it concretely, then you should first reduce the clothing outside the clothing—the overcoat. But Chinese people often have more slogans than actions. Positive slogans must be supplemented by opposing actions. As soon as the shout of reducing clothing stops, the father immediately goes to add clothing, as if reducing clothing is only worthy of being shouted, and adding clothing is the footnote of reducing clothing. This contradiction is really painful to say. But there is no way to correct it, so you have to listen to it. If you don't listen to it, then what?

Speaking of the initial mission of clothing, it is very simple, that is: "Clothing is for covering the body." Logically speaking, covering the body is enough, including keeping warm, and other trivial issues should be discarded. However, after sliding from neatness to gorgeousness, it almost stripped the true meaning of clothing. At the same time, people who "look down on others" have emerged one after another, thinking that "when returning home, the first thing to look at is clothing." This situation, deeply rooted in the country, grabs the psychology of most people, so they work diligently, only paying attention to clothing, planning it, and planning it, creating social hypocrisy. And it is not only hypocrisy.

I am not using the topic of "clothing outside clothing" to criticize our compatriots, but now that the country has reached this point, this expense seems to be able to be saved. Moreover, looking at the past, Chinese-style overcoats are mostly imported. Personal economy and national leakage are all related. Even if it is for keeping warm, why not change to making silk and cotton padded jackets to be lighter and warmer?

### New Voices in Housing

— Xin Liang

Italy's recent contribution to the science of life is the invention of a "sunflower" house. It rotates on a concentric track, so that the living room always faces the sun. The power is supplied by a three-horsepower engine located in the center of the house.

There is a glass hotel in Doncaster, England. It is declaring that glass can also be used as a building material. The outer walls and the inner rooms—even the floors and furniture—are all made of glass in various colors. The floor is composed of many small squares of colored glass, and it is not slippery to walk on.

In Chicago, there is a department store called Sears, and except for the display windows on the ground floor and the offices on the top floor, you can hardly see a window. However, the engineer who built the house said that its temperature and light will not be worse than buildings with windows, and can invisibly save us a lot. Because the goods damaged by sunlight, fireworks, and stains can be reduced, and the outside noise can also be isolated, which is especially beneficial because we will get more space to display goods.

Although walls and roofs can separate living rooms from the outside world, a large amount of heat will still escape from the windows. In order to overcome this shortcoming, American glass workers have made a double-layered glass window, which is to put two pieces of glass into a window frame at the same time. The dead air sealed in it acts as an obstacle to prevent heat from escaping, and moisture is also prevented from entering.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Dried mushrooms are also an important auxiliary product in dishes, and almost everyone loves to eat them. Only because most of them came from Japan before, everyone is unwilling to eat them, which is very respectable. But our country also produces them, not all of them are imported. Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, which is famous for porcelain (now called Fuliang), is the place of origin of dried mushrooms. The dried mushrooms produced are cheap and good, and are really above imported products. The top-quality products only cost one yuan and eight jiao per catty, and the flower mushrooms only cost about two yuan per catty. Each one is very thick. When cooked together in dishes, the taste is very delicious. Originally, when winter bamboo shoots are on the market, stir-frying the two winters is a seasonal dish in restaurants, and the price is very expensive. I didn't dare to add it to the economic menu for this reason, but recently the price has gone down; so let's have a stir-fried two winters to try this week. What is called stir-fried two winters? It is stir-fried winter bamboo shoot slices and dried mushrooms. It seems a bit uneconomical to use whole dried mushrooms, so you may want to look at the size of each one and cut it into two or four pieces, which can save a lot.

### Winter Clothing Selection

— Yuren

The first requirement for winter clothing is that it does not conduct heat, so that body temperature is not dissipated to the outside. There are also points called "warm," "soft," and "light," which are also indispensable. To have the above advantages, it is naturally necessary to use wool fabrics. Therefore, pure wool fabrics are the first choice for winter clothing, followed by silk and wool interwoven fabrics. Cotton fabrics also have a considerable effect on maintaining body temperature. The most undesirable thing is rayon fabrics, which not only cannot maintain the body's own heat, but also contradict the three essentials of warmth, softness, and lightness mentioned above: cold, hard, and heavy. In fact, rayon fabrics are not only unsuitable for winter clothing, but also not very suitable in other seasons, because they are not durable, easily wrinkled, and especially clothes that need to be washed cannot be put in water. What's more, rayon is basically a foreign product, and most of the goods imported by unscrupulous merchants these days are private goods. If our 40 million compatriots each have a rayon garment, and the average is assumed to be one yuan in national currency, the number is already alarming, and the British and American loans can be paid off in full!

### Necessary Treatment for Premature Aging and Kidney Deficiency

— Dr. Yang Daonan, graduated from the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Those who feel neurasthenia before the age of forty are generally called premature aging. If young people excessively masturbate or indulge in sexual desire after marriage, this disease is inevitable.

The short life span of Chinese people is indeed undeniable. Seeing that many young people suffer from neurasthenia or kidney deficiency, which leads to a lack of determination to make progress, this is not only a loss for them personally, but also the main reason for the weakness of the country.

Regarding the symptoms of premature aging, such as mental malaise, easy forgetfulness, feeling tired after a little work, difficulty falling asleep at night, dizziness, and memory loss, those who have these symptoms before the age of forty are generally called premature aging.

As for kidney deficiency, it refers to the decline of reproductive function. Symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, and infertility all belong to it, and have a related relationship with premature aging, because those who suffer from premature aging have this sad symptom.

Logically speaking, young people should have abundant vitality, so there should be no such problems. However, due to masturbation and indulgence in sexual desire, the above-mentioned diseases are caused.

In that case, the essences of the youth glands (i.e., the testicles) of strong animals are injected into the human body. That is to promote its prosperity, relieve its premature aging, and restore its inherent energy, so as to achieve rejuvenation. This is the latest invention of modern medicine, organ therapy.

Since the testicles are important reproductive organs, premature aging and kidney deficiency are caused by the dysfunction of this organ. Now, if we take the testicular essence of young animals to nourish the deficiency, it is indeed the most fundamental way to treat the symptoms.

For example, a forty-year-old person feels that his energy is declining. After engaging in this type of therapy, the above-mentioned malpractices can be delayed for at least ten years before they occur. Its treatment results have been definitely proven in clinical practice.

Testicular essence agent for men "Buti Kang" has a long history in the application of organ therapy. We doctors have accurately recognized its medicinal power. It generates essence and nourishes the kidneys in 24 hours, so it has the great functions of invigorating the nerves, nourishing the kidneys, nourishing the blood, and nourishing the brain. Whether the patient's disease belongs to premature ejaculation, or neurasthenia, premature aging, or even incomplete development, infertility after marriage, after taking "Buti Kang", he will get the effect of rejuvenation. In one thousand cases, there are almost no disappointed ones.

The reason why "Buti Kang" can exert outstanding efficacy is actually due to precise extraction. The animal glandular element used is mainly chimpanzee, so its efficacy can surpass other agents.

Women should take "Buti Kang" for women's diseases

If the bad habit of self-indulgence becomes a habit, then the frequency of nocturnal emission will also increase, which can lead to chronic urethritis, urethral leakage, and relaxation of the vas deferens. Seeing a member of the opposite sex will immediately cause nocturnal emission, so that person's energy is depleted, their complexion is pale, their development is incomplete, their sexual function is weak, they often have dizziness, insomnia, forgetfulness, mental palpitations, tinnitus, night sweats, and a sharp decrease in appetite. The heart and stomach. Although no major diseases have been discovered, all kinds of obstacles can strike at any time.

Speaking of the treatment of nocturnal emission caused by self-indulgence, the most important thing is health preservation, and then the German special medicine for nocturnal emission, "Nairs Nocturnal Emission Tablets," can be used to cure it. In case the person is too weak due to prolonged nocturnal emission, "Buti Kang," a German testicular essence preparation for men that nourishes the brain, kidneys, and blood, can be taken in conjunction. This has been proven to be highly effective in clinical trials. Famous doctors around the world unanimously recommend it and praise it highly, especially because its ingredients are pure and refined, and it is by no means comparable to ordinary endocrine preparations.

### The Practice of Curing Leukorrhea

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Theory should be combined with practice. If the theory is irrelevant to practice, then it is only empty talk and does not help the facts. Why should such empty theory be valued? Therefore, all scientific theories are based on practical evidence as the most important thing.

Recently, there have been many treatments for gonorrhea, causing patients to be at a loss. It is inevitable that they have a feeling of wandering on a path. This is tantamount to adding a layer of suffering from the problem of treatment in addition to the suffering of the disease. Therefore, as doctors, we have an unavoidable responsibility to provide guidance on the treatment of gonorrhea.

Based on my clinical experience of more than ten years, of course, all the treatments for gonorrhea that people know how to use, I have used them all. The so-called local therapy, chemical therapy, transmembrane sterilization therapy, and leukorrhea drugs that claim to be able to eradicate the disease in three to five days have all been tried, and the process has been carefully recorded. The advantages and disadvantages of the above-mentioned various treatments do not have a fixed standard, because these treatments are actually mostly unhelpful. According to my experience, the gonorrhea special medicine "Kelinong" invented by German Dr. Peter is the comet for treating gonorrhea. This agent is based on the principle of non-specific therapy, using a mixture of protein and pigment, and has undergone countless experiments and gradual improvements to achieve success. Doctors and specialized venereal disease hospitals in various countries have adopted it as a special oral medicine for gonorrhea. For example, the countries of Norway were countries where gonorrhea was rampant. Now, due to the invention of the drug "Kelinong", the number of patients has been drastically reduced. This can prove the general effectiveness of this agent. In general, over-the-counter drugs on the market or leukorrhea that is difficult to treat with other surgeries or that has been repeatedly treated without success are especially effective when taken. Generally, new drugs for treating gonorrhea only work if they have actual bactericidal power, and only then can they be eradicated. "Kelinong" is the crystallization of success obtained from actual efficacy, so it can be popular all over the world. For external use, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" to wash themselves according to the instructions in the manual. Women can use "Karsher Di Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories for external use, which will be even more effective (Note: "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is sold in both Zhongxi Taihe pharmacies in this city).

### Gonorrhea Lecture

— Physician Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

Is the Elimination of Gonorrhea Truly a Radical Cure?

Clear Urine is Insufficient Evidence: It is dangerous to judge whether gonorrhea is cured based on whether the urine is clear or not. In fact, most chronic gonorrhea cases have clear urine, and the patients themselves feel this phenomenon, so they do not consider it evidence of a cure for gonorrhea. Originally, gonorrhea is extremely small in size and can only be seen in its original form under a high-magnification microscope, which is beyond the reach of the naked eye. Generally, after gonorrhea becomes chronic, it mostly lies dormant inside and only emerges when the body's resistance is weakened. After sexual activity, alcoholism, or strenuous labor, gonorrhea will become active, and this cycle will inevitably lead to major problems. Only when gonorrhea recurs can gonorrhea-like flakes be seen floating in the urine again, which is especially a burden for chronic gonorrhea.

Turn into Other Symptoms and Treat Early: However, because the gonorrhea has cleared, most people are negligent in seeking a radical cure, so they often develop various other symptoms. The most notable are gonorrheal prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, cystitis, arthritis, urethral stricture, etc., all of which are caused by this. Now, if you want to fundamentally eliminate this gonorrhea, you must thoroughly cure it. In my personal experience, only the gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelinong" can take on this important task, and the combination of German electrostatic therapy and X-ray radiotherapy can especially exert the bactericidal and anti-gonorrhea power of "Kelinong". Because the bactericidal power of "Kelinong" is truly far-reaching and meticulous. Regardless of whether the gonorrhea is superficial in the mucous membrane or deep in the inner layer of the tendons and bones, its bactericidal power is more than enough. Therefore, if you want to fundamentally and quickly solve the gonorrhea problem, you cannot achieve the true goal without this. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. From today, 20 numbers will be given out every day, and each number will only cost 5 cents.

### The Choice of Lung Medicine

— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang

Lingering coughs are often a precursor to lung disease. To prevent lung disease, it is imperative to quickly cure coughs. I have been a lung disease expert for nearly 20 years. Due to my extensive experience in various symptoms of lung disease, I am very confident in which medicine is the most effective. Whether it is to relieve coughs or treat various forms of tuberculosis, the German medicine "Bufei Naier" can definitely do the job happily. No matter how stubborn the cough is, taking "Bufei Naier" can relieve the cough and expel phlegm within three hours, making it easier to cough up phlegm, and it can also nourish the lungs, with effects far above ordinary lung medicines. Those who suffer from lung disease and feel that other medicines are ineffective may wish to try this product, as its effectiveness is indeed reliable.

### "Also Has"

— Du Jin

"What foreign countries have, China also has." This is a sentence we often say. "What China has, foreign countries also have." This is also a sentence we often say. However, these two sentences each have their own meanings.

Rong Ren Gong once wrote an article saying that "Gentleman" is the most special word in English, and there is a "Junzi" in Chinese that is exactly the same, which shows that Chinese is the richest language in the world. This argument did cause a stir for a while, but in the end, no one paid attention to it. In the past, the foreign language that was popular in China was only English, and the high-level Chinese people that Mr. Liang interacted with only kept calling the word "Gentleman" in their mouths, so Mr. Liang had such a "smokescreen". This kind of invention of "what foreign countries have, China also has" is actually not clever.

However, this kind of not-so-clever invention can still be considered not to be rambling. Because there is indeed a word "Gentleman" in English, and it does have something to do with the "Junzi" in Chinese. The most thorough is the shouting of another faction. Kang Youwei went to Shaanxi to give a lecture and roared: Confucius also invented wireless telegraphy, and he was going to write a book to invent Confucius's invention. However, until his death, that book was never published. This time, the "what foreign countries have, China also has" resulted in only "nothing".

When this trend reached the last dynasty, it became even more of a scam. Now, some famous Chinese medicine practitioners in Shanghai also use stethoscopes when treating patients, and also ask patients to take quinine when treating malaria. They rarely say "sour medicine belongs to wood and enters the liver, bitter medicine belongs to fire and enters the heart" anymore, but they are still scolding Western medicine. The meaning is obvious that they attribute stethoscopes and quinine to their "ancestral" names. This method is naturally much smarter than before. They made a fortune by "what foreign countries have", and then went a step further and simply said: "What foreign countries have is actually all Chinese!" Not only is it more thorough, but it also takes advantage of it, which is really admirable.

But no matter what, this kind of "what foreign countries have, China also has" can actually be said to originate from a kind of competitive spirit. Although it eventually became taking advantage of it, the creator of this trend still has a place to be forgiven. The most useless is "what China has, foreign countries also have."

China has mahjong, and foreign countries also have poker; China has "Sanbian Wine", and foreign countries also have Curacao; China has foot binding, and foreign countries also have waist binding; China has concubines, and foreign countries also have mistresses...

Although the purpose is to justify oneself, those things cannot be said to be good things in foreign countries, and uselessness has naturally reached its peak. However, on the matter itself, it can still be said to be passable. Only when this trend reaches the last dynasty will it also become a scam, and the characteristic of that scam is: using foreign good things to cover up one's own useless things.

There was a past example. A poet who considered himself a symbolist made poems that no one could understand, so he said: "I will translate a famous foreign poem for you, and see if it is easy to understand!" The poem was really translated, and it was said to be "Nocturne parlsien" by the French poet Verlaine, which did make people's eyes turn white after reading it. But fortunately, the era was no longer that of Liang Rengong, and some people could actually read French. When the original text was read, it was discovered that the poem was originally easy to understand. In this way, the poet's secret was revealed, so the poet sadly slipped away, and it seems that there have never been any symbolic masterpieces since then.

There is also a current example. A group of "peace-loving" great men are "fighting for peace". Because they were scolded so badly that they had no choice, they said: "It doesn't matter if we are humiliated, don't you know that Russia once signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with foreign countries?" This is a really good analogy. "Anti-communism" is right, but the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk is a treasure. However, in the end, it is probably not feasible, because there are many people who know what the situation in Russia is like and what the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk is, and in the end, they still cannot deceive people, and they can only shrink their heads and be done with it.

"What China has, foreign countries also have" is fundamentally inferior to "what foreign countries have, China also has". Therefore, the scam of the last dynasty not only does not take advantage of it, but also reveals its hideous face even more.

### A Clown in a Fascist Martial Arts Troupe: "Watch My Trick!"

— Cang Qi

### In the Concentration Camps of Germany (Part Two)

— Translated by Wan

After that, we held "Prussian-style gymnastics." The team advanced on the exercise field of Burleigh. "Lie down!" "Stand up!" The iron-like command forced every prisoner to become a docile lamb.

We also have game time in a day, but the so-called game is not to give us a good rest, but to tell us to stand in serious teams and learn the National Socialist morality and the action guidelines of the Third Reich.

At four o'clock, we all returned to the barracks for dinner: black bread and vegetables. After five o'clock, we were allowed two hours of freedom (the so-called going out, of course, was within the scope of the concentration camp). Every day, we had two hours to talk, but our conversations were very cautious. We often took a very long time to gain an understanding of the prisoners on the neighboring bed before starting to talk freely. We rarely knew the real names of the cohabiting prisoners, because the more we knew, the more trouble we would have. Many prisoners who seemed to know a lot were expelled by the guards. Where did they go? What did they do? These were all questions that we could not understand. Our spirits had been destroyed, and our whole day was immersed in constant fear and inexplicable intimidation. As a result, we were deprived of the courage to even talk.

"Two hours of freedom?" What to do? Cigarettes, books, and magazines were all prohibited. We could only read Hitler's "Mein Kampf" - the only coercive tool used by the Nazi authorities to promote their doctrine. In January, we only had one chance to get a military note and write a letter home under strict supervision. In January, we also only had one chance to receive a letter from outside that had been checked. On my wife's black-edged letter paper, she frantically reported that my family was using all means outside to save me from the camp. For six months, we never knew why I was declared guilty without trial; at the same time, I didn't know when my prisoner life would end.

An invisible pressure deprived us prisoners of our morality. There were a total of three thousand prisoners here. Although in Germany, they always maintained their pure and independent conscience. Everything that violated their conscience was the planned oppression that caused it. We were controlled by them like mutes and banished beasts. We were imprisoned there, which was the Nazis' means of destroying the spirit of those mutes or banished beasts. Texas - the death of the spirit! Our only wish was fixed on one goal: to be cautious in all our actions in order to achieve the hope of early freedom and liberation.

In this way, until seven o'clock, we went to bed. Ten hours of sleep was certainly not too little. In fact, the Nazis often disturbed us during this sleep time, so that we could not sleep peacefully. Every night, we were immersed in dark thoughts, whispering our expectations and fears to each other. Later, a very big rumor spread in the camp, saying that ×× had committed suicide; ××× had been assassinated; at the same time, we could be free next Saturday!

Many prisoners could not bear the senseless harassment, so they simply committed suicide. One prisoner secretly obtained a piece of tin from the stove and quickly used it to chop off his wrist, then quietly lay on the bed with a smile until he bled to death. Several tied knots with rags and sneaked out to a damp place, where they hanged themselves in the dark.

These six months of leisurely years slowly dragged on, slowly passing through the rough situation every day. This kind of life continued until I left the camp and got back on the windowless truck that took me here from Munich.

I was imprisoned by them without any reason or purpose, and there was still no news of the "trial." Finally, a train took me to Kopres, where I was imprisoned for another month before they took me to court.

The three judges selected by the state lawyer declared that my crime was treasonously violating the German people, and the old woman who came to visit my sister-in-law testified. At that time, one of the doors of the court was half open, and my wife was standing there! During the lawyer's defense time, we were given a chance to look at each other. In the silent gaze, our hearts almost broke!

The three judges believed that my crime should be sentenced to four months of imprisonment. The time I spent here awaiting trial was already seven months, so this four-month sentence was considered to be before my release, and I had to take an oath: I must keep secret everything I saw and heard in the concentration camp. If I violated this oath, I would be subject to imprisonment by the German Board of Reflections.

My wife and I went to Berlimenfu to get our American passports. After they issued them, I bid farewell to Germany forever.

Even now, when my wife and I hear those stories about Nazi Germany in tea rooms with friends, my heart jumps involuntarily; at the same time, to avoid being heard by others, I lower the tone of my conversation. Even now, I still don't believe that I am in a free country - the United States! (Translated from Collier's)

### A Great Group

— Yan Peng

In order to save the country from disaster, in order to protect our homeland; go! Brothers, pick up our shovels! A silver-gray wilderness night. A group of black shadows, tall and short, talking, laughing, humming songs, left the quiet village and walked towards the road.

That endless "Hai Zheng Highway" had been neatly repaired by the enemy after the second fall of Suining. Cars came and went constantly during the day, and the smell of gasoline spread and could still be smelled at night.

The sky was filled with stars and the moon, casting a cold light, and the wind was blowing a sad tune on the withered trees.

"We're here! Yuejia Bridge."

The flowing water under the bridge was washing away the gravel on the edge, making a crisp sound, rustling...

"Come on! Brothers, let's work together to destroy this bridge!"

With that, a group of black shadows dispersed.

Tall and short, waving shovels, rising and falling, the clanging sound was very crisp, forming a great symphony!

"Hmm! Old Wu! Does this sound good?"

"Of course! It's more pleasant than the sound of bombs dropped by airplanes!"

"Damn it: the soldiers are having nightmares in their beds at this time!"

"Hey! The soldiers won't guess that we farmers did it when they find out that the bridge is broken!"

Talking, laughing, and excitedly waving their strong arms.

Stone strips and mud clods kept falling into the water, splashing up patches of broken waves, revealing glittering silver light.

"Crash!" Suddenly, with such a sound, a section of the bridge in the middle of the three holes collapsed completely.

"Hehe! It's done! Let's brothers cross the river to dig up the highway!"

A group of black shadows waded across the water, and soon they were waving shovels on the smooth road over there.

Everyone is shedding blood and sweat together, huh ha hai,

Resist the war,

Even if the frost wind blows cold to the bone! Huh ha hai

……

The cheerful singing gently rippled in the silent air.

"Quieter! Don't be too happy, it's not fun if the devils hear us."

"……"

The moon slipped past the mid-sky, and the rustling cold wind kept blowing,

The night was deep, and the shovels danced more quickly...

"Alright! It's almost dawn!"

A group of great black shadows slowly moved again.

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

The banquet started at noon, but it wasn't even ten o'clock yet, and the guests had arrived one after another. Everyone wanted to take this opportunity to admire the demeanor of Commander Ye. These guests, such as Lu Yaojin, the principal of Hup Elementary School, Jin Chunan, a doctor, Yang Yueliang, a map director, and Cai Hefeng, the owner of Fengmu Firm, were all well-known figures in the town who were greeted everywhere they went. Inviting them to be guests for Commander Ye was indeed not humiliating.

Because it was still early, the guests used conversation to pass the time. Needless to say, the topic of conversation was focused on the war. The only newspaper in the township office became a very valuable material. The newspaper was reporting the news that the soldiers had landed on Jinshanwei and attacked Songyin Mishidu, but the people present were very vague about the geographical situation and did not know where Jinshanwei was. However, there was no map in the newspaper that day, which could not help everyone understand, so everyone had to guess wildly.

"I guess Jinshanwei must be on the other side of Liuhe," said Yang Yueliang, the map director, affirmatively, stroking his mustache. "Otherwise, it wouldn't have such a significant impact on the military. Last time, during the January 28 Shanghai War, we had to retreat because the soldiers landed on Liuhe, didn't we?"

"Maybe it's not necessarily on Liuhe," said Dr. Jin Chunan tactfully. He was a well-rounded person and obviously didn't want to offend the map director in his words. "If it was on the other side of Liuhe, then the troops fighting near Shanghai should have retreated to Kunshan Qingyanggang, why are they still holding on to West Shanghai and Nanshi after retreating from Zhabei?"

"I think it's probably in Pudong," said Cai Hefeng, the owner of Hefeng Timber Company, who was reading the newspaper. He folded the newspaper casually, but eagerly found the words "Punan" from the news and pointed them out to everyone, saying: "Punan and Pudong must be close to each other, this is a very good proof."

"Punan is Punan, Pudong is Pudong, how can you confuse them," said Yang Yueliang unconvinced, his nature has always been a bit stubborn.

However, Cai Hefeng refused to give in and insisted on his own opinion, saying:

"Who knows, maybe the word "South" was originally the word "East", and the typesetter made a mistake." (II)

### A Mother's Farewell Amidst a Barrage of Arrows is a Patriotic Drama

— Su Shaoqing

"A Mother's Farewell Amidst a Barrage of Arrows" is two scenes from the Kunqu opera "The Iron Crown Picture." It tells the story of Zhou Yuji, a loyal minister of the late Ming Dynasty, who defends Ningwu Pass alone against insurmountable odds. As a result, his elderly mother, wife, children, and servants all sacrifice themselves. Zhou himself is killed by Li Chuang's barrage of arrows, making it a heroic and tragic play about sacrificing oneself for the country. This play has always been highly regarded and is now performed by several schools. The Kunqu opera troupe's performance is the authentic and direct transmission. The Gaoqiang opera troupe's performance is similar to Kunqu opera, except that during the farewell scene, Zhou's wife seizes Zhou's sword unexpectedly and commits suicide, which is different from the Kunqu version, where Zhou throws the sword to his wife, implying that she should kill herself. The Erhuang opera troupe also sings Kunqu opera, which originally evolved from the Kunqu opera troupe, but there are slight differences in the postures and lyrics.

In the Gaoqiang school, I have seen Tao Xianting often perform this play (while Han Shichang performed "The Tiger Assassin"). In the Erhuang school, I have seen Yu Shuyan perform it, reportedly taught by Yao Zenglu (who played Zhou's mother at the time). I have also seen Rui Deshi perform a segment. In the Kunqu school, I used to see Shi Chuanzhen perform several segments. Now I see Zheng Chuanjian perform it, with Chuan Ling performing the barrage of arrows. Ignoring the rest, I will now comment on Zheng's art.

Zheng Chuanjian, playing Zhou Yuji, sings with strength and has the play in his heart and on his face. The feelings of grief and indignation are completely expressed without any omissions. Although his voice is not smooth, he does not screech in the high notes. If he had a good voice, he would be even more outstanding. His stage movements are skillful, every hand gesture and stance is proper. During the fire-fighting scene, he even performs a backflip, which is very tense, though it seems slightly influenced by Peking opera. I recall that twenty years ago, Tao Xianting crawled forward on his knees in this section. In the barrage of arrows scene, Chuan Ling is good at transmitting the arrows. After being shot, he returns to the stage as a stiff corpse and falls backward, which is extremely solid and unprecedented. In this scene, he fights a tiger beforehand, which is quite spectacular. Although there is a hint of Peking opera in the martial arts, it must be said that there is progress. Chuan Qian also excels at transmitting the barrage of arrows in several scenes, with superb martial arts skills.

Besides these two acts, there were "Borrowing Military Pay," "Borrowing Tea," and "A Stroll in the Garden, Awakening from a Dream," performed jointly by Zhu Chuanming and Zhang Chuanfang. However, the audience turnout was not as large as for xiaoshu (storytelling) and new dramas, proving the saying "high art finds few followers."

According to official history, Zhou's wife did not commit suicide but was a female hero who led several hundred female soldiers in street battles against the rebels, eventually committing suicide after exhausting her strength. In the second year of the Xuantong era, I visited Fengshan Mountain in Pi County, which is the hometown of Zhu Zhi. The mountain is not very high, but there is a Zhou Yuji temple on it. The murals depict the entire story of the resistance against the war and his martyrdom at Ningwu Pass, all based on the official history of the Ming Dynasty. There is also a painting of Madam Zhu leading female soldiers in street battles. Many residents in the villages at the foot of the mountain are surnamed Zhou, said to be descendants of Yuji. It is thought that although Yuji's immediate family died in martyrdom, other branches of his family have not died out, as the saying goes, "A loyal minister's line will not be cut off."

This play is an excellent patriotic drama, of great significance for the independence of the Chinese nation, shining brightly throughout the ages, comparable to the sun and moon. It should be vigorously promoted in all sectors of society. I once studied the music of this play with Jin Jun and a certain musician in Tianjin (introduced by Tong Manqiu from the south), but I have never performed it, mainly because I was afraid of the difficulty. I heard that the Red Bean Villa owner learned this play from Tan Xinpei himself, and I intend to verify this.

### Artistic Tastes

— KS

For a time, Han Langan was even crowned with the nickname "Eastern Laurel," which made Little Monkey feel delighted. Therefore, Little Monkey, hoping that his acting would closely resemble Laurel's, spent a lot of money to specifically study Laurel's movements. As a result, there are many places in his performance style that are learned from Laurel. However, although this is imitation, it also shows Little Monkey's dedication to art. Before Little Monkey appeared on the screen, his nickname was "Little Trembler." In the Ximeng Road area of ​​Ma Lang Road, he could often be seen lying across the road kicking a small leather ball, always trying to take advantage of women. Now that he is famous in the film industry, he may not need to put on airs, but he must have a presence. He rides his motorcycle back and forth every day, making a "put put put" sound, which is indeed a bit imposing.

Although Film Queen Hu Die is not as delicate as the young girls, her beauty is still as good as ever. Her appearance is elegant and luxurious, but in reality, she is very stingy. She does not have the extravagant habits of other actresses, but is full of deep storage. Saving is her natural ability: often thirty copper coins are exchanged for a dime; ten dimes are exchanged for a dollar; accumulating five one-dollar bills becomes five dollars; collecting two five-dollar bills becomes ten dollars; and so on, from hundreds to thousands, from thousands to tens of thousands. Other actresses are panicked every day, but she is the opposite. If someone asks her, she will tell you "Raise children to prevent old age, store grain to prevent famine." These two old sayings.

Old-timer Huang Junfu, a big guy, is also the small boss of a pork shop in Fahua Town, Xuhui. He always raises seven or eight sows at home, hoping that they will eat, sleep, and become fat. Who knew that things would gather according to type, and the thin Huang Junfu actually became as fat as a pig. Huang's expression is dull and rigid, which is not pleasing to the director, but he can rely on his fatness to fill a role and regulate the atmosphere. Later, because he indulged in gambling, he became confused and lost everything. He went from being a boss to a pauper, and his body became as thin as a snowman under the sun. I advise fat Huang to turn back, as the shore is within sight.

"Nominal Husband and Wife" is Ruan Lingyu's debut work. From that film, you can see Wang Xianzai's elegant and suave appearance in his youth. Because of his inherently sinister face, his role in the film is to play villains and be an unpleasant person. In reality, however, his conduct is truly "Amitabha," a very good gentleman who must bow and greet everyone. He lives in Mingle Lane on Foch Road and is obsessed with radio. His house is filled with several large and small radios, and the sound of Suzhou storytelling fills his bedroom all day long.

Poet-director Sun Yu is a graduate of Nankai University who does not like to talk and looks at people with calm eyes all day long. He loves ideals, and the materials in the films he directs are his only reminders of his ideals. He also loves carnality, such as the fat legs of women that are the most common embellishments in "Little Toys," "Sports Queen," and "Go to Nature." What does this mean? His answer is "Because the audience below the stage has the same taste as me!" Wonderful!

### Another Round of Kowtowing in the Opera World

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

"Adoptive Father" and "Teacher" in Harmony, "Tianjin" and "Shanghai" Rejoice Together

My friend Chen Chanweng wrote an article titled "A Sound of Apprenticeship in Tianjin" twenty years ago, published in the entertainment section of this newspaper, recording important news in the opera world. This article describes things that Chanweng did not know about, and I am eager to select them and turn them into an article, published in this section, also with the intention of supplementing historical records.

Newcomer Kunqu actress Tong Zhiling is the daughter of Tong Hanxia, a famous figure in the Tianjin education circle. She is intelligent, talented, and obsessed with opera. When she was very young, she began learning opera from a certain actor, diligently and tirelessly studying without complaint. Immersed for several years, her progress was rapid, and now she has emerged. My friend Sha Dafeng is a talented figure in the Pingju opera world and has a reputation in Tianjin. Seeing that Zhiling's talent and art are both excellent, he believes she is promising, and his articles of praise are seen in newspapers in Tianjin. Zhiling's father, grateful for Sha's encouragement, specially asked someone to act as an intermediary, intending to have his daughter become Sha's apprentice. Sha has a lot of contact with people in the opera world and appreciates Zhiling. Now that Zhiling is willing to become an adopted daughter, he is naturally happy to agree. Zhiling heard that Sha had not refused, and was overjoyed. On the 14th of last month, she personally went to the Tianfeng Newspaper Office to hold an adoption ceremony. The ceremony was very grand, with over sixty guests including celebrities such as Wang Bolong, Jin Laoguan, Liu Yunruo, and prominent figures from all walks of life in Tianjin. It was a grand occasion, and the atmosphere was especially pleasant and enthusiastic, with toasts and mutual encouragement.

Kunqu actress Jin Youqin (the name "Youqin" reported in a certain newspaper was wrong) was recognized by Jin Shaobao Xihou, and her reputation was shaken. Recently, under the leadership of Shaobao, Youqin went to Tianjin to become an apprentice of Wang Yaoqing, a famous Dan actor, to seek further studies. Yaoqing received Shaobao's letter and immediately agreed, and chose the 14th to hold the apprenticeship ceremony in his home at Dama Temple. Youqin's art is not weak, and in the future, with the personal guidance of the old actor Wang, her achievements will be limitless.

Boy actor Du Fuchu, the younger brother of famous Kunqu actress Du Liyun, came to Shanghai from Tianjin in early summer. Because of his admiration for Mr. Su Shaoqing, he specially asked someone to introduce him, requesting to become his student. Seeing that Youchu was intelligent, Mr. Su accepted him and taught him six Tan school operas, including "Empty City Stratagem," "Fish Intestine Sword," "Eight Righteous Figures," "Hongyang Cave," "Drumming and Scolding Cao," and "Qin Qiong Sells His Horse," as a greeting gift. Recently, Youchu also became the adopted son of Luo Quyuana, a famous amateur performer. On the day of the ceremony, Luo said to Youchu with a smile: "Teacher Su has taught you six plays. As your adoptive father, I should at least double that. Now, I will teach you "The Precious Lotus Lantern." After "The Precious Lotus Lantern" is completed, I will continue to teach you "Sitting in the Building and Killing the Daughter-in-Law," "Emerald Screen Mountain," and "The Upright Official's Booklet," what do you think?" Youchu was shocked and returned to tell his sister: "With these two 'teachers' and one 'father,' how can I not become a famous actor?" Liyun said: "Do your best and never let down the cultivation of these two adults."

Sha Dafeng wrote from Tianjin, saying that Zheng Bingru, a newly famous Kunqu actress in Tianjin, has excellent talent and art and is worth cultivating. If I could take her as an adopted daughter, Dafeng would be very willing to act as Cao Qiu. I replied expressing my agreement. There has never been anyone with the surname Zheng in the opera world. Now Bingru is like a rare flower emerging. It is the supreme glory of our Rongyang clan. If Bingru does not dislike my old age and is willing to call me adoptive father, I would be seeking it and not be able to get it, so how could I pretend to be polite and reject her from thousands of miles away? This letter has been sent for seven days. It is expected that on the day this manuscript is published, it will be the time when this letter reaches Dafeng. Upon seeing the letter, Dafeng will definitely tell Bingru immediately, so the time when this manuscript is published will also be the time when Bingru calls me adoptive father. Thinking of this, how can my heart not bloom with joy!

Currently, Gu is in contact with the Tianjin Chinese Grand Theater, exchanging letters and telegrams, and the two sides are very close, and there is a good chance of success.

The Gongwu Stage has decided that the day shows will run until the 18th starting from New Year's Day of Jimao. After that, movies will be shown from Monday to Friday every week. The stage's martial arts actor Wang Fuying resigned from the troupe, but the authorities announced that he would remain in his original position, and his request was not approved.

Zhang Yipeng, the pillar of the Xinji Grand Stage, has recently expressed his intention to retire. After repeated persuasion and retention by backstage personnel and his friends, Zhang has abandoned his prejudice and will definitely continue to work there next spring.

Since the Red Star Theater began showing dramas, it has suffered huge losses and cannot maintain itself, so it announced its suspension of performances yesterday. It is reported that the authorities of the Queen will negotiate with Wang Yigong and Dong Tianmin, the persons in charge of the Red Star, based on the contract.

— Ruoqi

The Shanghai Relief Fund-Raising Amateur Performer Group for Refugees was on its fourth day, January 30th. Those who appeared on stage in the night show at the Golden Grand Theater were all child amateurs. Among them was the young Hu Guorong, who is only eleven years old. He played Shi Yi Lang in "White Water Beach." His makeup was handsome; his actions were skilled; and his singing was powerful from beginning to end. At such a young age, he was impeccable. During his spare time, he learns Peking opera, possessing all these talents. He is truly rare in the amateur world. His father is Mr. Hu Fangming, a comprador of the French Municipal Council. Considering the good deed, he ordered his son to participate, showing enthusiasm for public welfare, which is truly admirable.

### Anecdotes of Spoken Drama

— Yan

Spoken drama in China in its early days was imported from the West and began in schools run by Westerners. Ten years before the founding of the Republic of China, that is, in the eleventh month of the winter of the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu (1902), the Shanghai Christian Hanzhu Academy created and performed spoken dramas, and the Xuhui Public School followed suit; however, the stories performed were European and Western stories, spoken in English and French. Only those who were familiar with Europeanized writing could understand.

In the twelfth month of the winter of Gengzi, the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu (1903), the Shanghai Puyang Public School performed a spoken drama. At that time, it happened to be the Boxer Rebellion, and the plays "Six Gentlemen" and "Boxers" were performed in the classroom for trial performances. The audience was students from Nanyang and Minli Teachers College - this was the first time that spoken drama in China evolved from Europeanization to being sung in "Beijing dialect." In the seventh month of the autumn of the following year, Jia Chen, Nanyang Public School and Minli Middle School also performed spoken dramas. Then, Minli students took the lead in contacting teachers and students from various schools to create the Wenyou Society to study spoken drama.

In the twelfth month of the winter of Jiyou, the first year of Xuantong (1909), students from the Suzhou Gospel Hospital contacted the Jinhua Troupe to perform plays in Shanghai to help with disaster relief. They rehearsed "The Bloody Handprint." The hospital director, Mr. Yang Mou, played Han Lexi, the leader of the big class. When it came to the scene where the leader was assassinated, Chen Deyao, who played the assassin, actually killed him. Later, Chen was convicted of murder in a play and sentenced to life imprisonment, and died in prison not long after. - This is a strange case in the history of the Chinese spoken drama world.

In the fifth month of the summer of the first year of the Republic of China (1912), the Women's Suffrage Association performed plays in Zhang Garden, including "Female Lawyer" and "Women's World Clock," with the intention of promoting the revolution - this was the beginning of Chinese women's spoken drama.

### "Algiers" — Produced by United Artists

— Wei

Starring Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr.

The filmmaking style of Hollywood entered another stage in the spring of 1938. This change, in general, was a shift from light-hearted musical comedies to more serious social and cultural dramas with depth. The film "Algiers" can be said to be a pioneering blockbuster after the change in style. The film tells the story of the tense and romantic life of Pepe le Moko, a notorious gang leader in the Casbah. The police have tried every possible way to arrest him, but the results have always been failures. The streets of the Casbah are narrow, and the residents are very complex. The director made great efforts to portray the special atmosphere and complex social background of that place. The strong local color added a lot of strength. The female lead in the film is played by Hedy Lamarr, the sensual star known for her performance in "Ecstasy." In this film, she makes even greater artistic sacrifices than before. The film was also produced by famous Chinese cinematographer Huang Zongzhan. Huang's unique art, that elusive magic, will be displayed in the film.

### Li Amao and the Entertainment World

— Xiao Fan

The comedian Xu Zhuodai, nicknamed Dr. Li Amao, has had a long history with the entertainment world. He studied physical education in Japan, but after returning to China, he did not work in the sports world for long. He had the longest contact with the entertainment world and has not broken away from it to this day.

He was a pioneer in the spoken drama world, which was then called civilization drama, along with Zheng Zhengqiu. His stage name was Xu Banmei, specializing in playing clowns to provide audiences with laughter. At that time, even if a play was a tragedy, there was often a joke inserted in the middle to allow the audience to change their taste and break the monotony. Now, not to mention that there are no such talents in the spoken drama world, how many famous clowns are there in the Peking opera world? He is the most suitable person to know about the history of spoken drama.

Although he has not put in hard work in Peking opera, he and Xia Yueyu and others have created a serial drama combining film and Peking opera, which has become a style with another kind of interest. Now that he is over fifty years old, if he tightens his throat and hums a few lines of singing from "That Day, I Dressed Up and Looked in the Mirror," people next door would think it was a sixteen-year-old girl.

He not only personally dedicated himself to the silver screen but also jointly founded the "Happy Company" film company with Wang Youyou, specializing in filming comedies. After the Happy Company closed, he sometimes worked as an actor, sometimes as a director, and sometimes as a screenwriter. Able to act, direct, and write, he truly deserves to be called the "Oriental Chaplin." Recently, he still often writes movie scripts and serves as a lecturer at the "Star Training Institute."

While engaged in the entertainment world, he has never stopped writing. His style always cannot escape being comical, humorous, and interesting. The name of the comedian came from when he wrote comical novels. Li Amao was the protagonist in one of his novels. Later, he used this name to create a mailbox, answering readers' questions in a comical tone. The name Li Amao became famous, even more so than Xu Zhuodai. As for his name when he was studying - Xu Chuanlin, even fewer people know about it.

After the National Army withdrew to the West, he also edited the weekly "Instant Karma," still consistently using the same comical style as before, but using a Shanghai term for "flirting." There is also an "Entertainment" column in "Instant Karma," specializing in publishing news about the entertainment world, often providing correct criticism and correction to the current entertainment world. Recently, he has also published two scales of New Year's games, "Li Amao's Shanghai Adventure" and "Tofu Beauty's Escape Map," which are extremely comical and are the only wonderful products in the Lunar New Year. - Li Amao is a strange thing that has never been separated from the entertainment world.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City Opera World (93)

— Xu Muyun

Yu Zhenting Should Play Tyrants and Local Bullies

Recently, newspapers have been competing to publish the news of the death of Xiaomaobao Yu Zhenting. Indeed, his skills were worthy of mention. Jusheng had five sons and three daughters. The eldest son entered the bureaucracy and died early. Although Zhenting was Jusheng's adopted son, the opera world called him Yu Wu, probably in order after his three older sisters. His third brother died young, his fourth brother Zanting, and his fifth brother Huating, all learned martial arts. Because Jusheng loved his youngest son the most, he wanted to pass on all his unique skills to Huating. However, Huating was young and did not work hard to practice, so in the end he did not get anything, which is a pity. Zhenting first entered the Fushou Opera School as an apprentice, studying the beard-and-gown role, but soon changed to studying martial arts. Because of his impatient nature, like his father, everyone called him Xiaomaobao. Judging from his performance, he was not suitable for long-gown plays. Short-gown plays like "Lotus Temple," "Golden Leopard," and "White Water Beach" were probably better than Xiaolou and Heyu. His most skillful and suitable play for his character was "Yan Yang Lou." When he went to Gaodeng, he was different from others as soon as he appeared on stage. His makeup was good, and his poses, style, and stature were all fashionable and beautiful. Later in the fighting scenes, Zhenting's skills were quick and agile, spinning like a whirlwind. Anyone who played against him could not keep up with his speed. In fact, these supporting actors, such as Fan Shiting, Chi Yeting, and Xu Deyi, were all well-known figures in the martial arts world. Especially the martial arts performer Xu Deyi was the eldest son of the famous Kui school Laosheng Xu Yintang. Counting out old Qian Jinfu, he was also considered the first person in martial arts. Although his hands were fast, he was still slightly inferior to Zhenting. This shows the true skill of the Yu family. Old Yu knew that his son was good at portraying tyrants and local bullies, so he passed on the long-gown plays such as "Changbanpo," "Siping Mountain," "Hunyuanhe," and "Picking Huache" to Xiaolou and Heyu as much as possible, without hiding anything. Once, Zhenting strongly requested his father to perform "Lianhuan Tao." Old Yu stopped him, saying that this play was not his forte and would damage his reputation if performed. This is truly the saying "No one knows his son like his father." Old Yu was upright, honest, and selfless. He was truly rare in the ancient and modern opera world. Now that Zhenting is dead, it is said that many people went to pay their respects. I am afraid that many people will miss Old Yu's old kindness, and therefore have a feeling of loving the house and its crow. Among the existing martial arts performers in Peiping, there is Sun Yukun (also known as Little Zhenting) who can pass on the learning of both Yu and Yang. I hope that he can revive himself and come south to show his skills, which would be much better than Zhou Yitui (Ruian) and others.
