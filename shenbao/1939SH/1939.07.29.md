### After the Abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, the United States Considers Further Measures: Restricting Imports of Japanese Gold, Silver, and Goods, Determining Actions Based on the Development of the Far Eastern Situation

(Washington) The United States' action to abolish the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty has clearly defined the U.S. position in the Far East. How U.S.-Japan relations will change in the future depends entirely on Japan's attitude and its actions in the Far East. Government and diplomatic circles expect Japan to take some kind of economic retaliation. If Japan truly retaliates, the United States has long-prepared plans to counter Japan and to avenge the humiliation the U.S. rights and Americans in China have repeatedly suffered. (American Associated Press dispatch, 28th)

(Washington) After the announcement of the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Secretary of State Hull issued a statement saying that the State Department will closely monitor the Far Eastern situation until the expiration of the treaty at the end of January next year in order to consider the situation and decide on a course of action. Several reporters asked whether the U.S. government intends to start negotiations with Japan to conclude a new commercial treaty. He replied that the State Department will maintain a wait-and-see attitude for six months. Another reporter asked about the conversation between U.S. Charg√© d'Affaires Dooman and the Director of the American Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Yoshizawa. He replied that there were no results. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

(Washington) U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that since the State Department announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty yesterday, the Treasury Department will reconsider the issue of purchasing Japanese gold and silver and increasing import tariffs on Japanese cotton cloth in order to counter the export subsidies granted by the Japanese government. It is reported that if the United States stops purchasing Japanese gold and silver, it will deal a major blow to Japan, as Japan has sold gold worth US$415,000,000 and silver worth US$4,000,000 to the United States in the past two years. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

(Washington) Sources close to the government here recently stated that the Treasury Department will take measures against Japanese imported goods that compete with American goods through dumping, and will focus on restricting imports of Japanese cotton textiles. After the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty on January 26 next year, the following measures may be implemented sequentially: (1) Increase harbor taxes for Japanese ships docking in American ports; (2) Restrict the entry of Japanese goods salesmen into the United States; (3) Prohibit the shipment of arms and military supplies to Japan. All of these will depend on how Japan deals with American interests in China, as well as the U.S. public opinion and the determination of the Senate to take action. As far as the Senate is concerned, since the establishment of the initial Anglo-Japanese agreement, there is deep concern that it will cause adverse effects, coupled with the fact that American interests in China are still being harmed, so the attitude has become tougher. Secretary of State Hull said two days ago that the State Department's attitude had not changed and even asked Republican Senator Vandenberg to postpone the abolition proposal until the next session of Congress. The sudden decision to abolish the treaty yesterday was due to the hardening attitude of the Senate. American political figures have had a good reaction to the abolition of the treaty. People in the State Department said that the government had long intended to implement a tough policy towards Japan, but was particularly afraid that public opinion would not fully support it, so it was not implemented until yesterday. Republicans believe that the abolition proposal was initiated by Republican Senator Vandenberg, and they feel satisfied with the party's victory. In short, the Democratic and Republican parties have now become united. The State Department's diplomatic actions in the Far East will be facilitated, and the impact will be that it will be easier to take action in Europe as well. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull declared yesterday that since the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was announced to be abolished this Wednesday, if the two countries want to conclude a new treaty, they must first eliminate political differences. Hull was unwilling to explain the content of the note to Japan, saying only that the note stated that the signing of a new treaty would be determined by the results of careful research. After careful consideration, the U.S. government is certain that "some provisions of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty urgently need to be re-examined." According to his tone, the Japanese government must attach importance to American interests in China. It is said that officials in Washington believe that the Japanese discrimination against Americans in China has long violated the spirit of the treaty. According to Hull, the treaty will not expire for another six months, so what developments may occur within these six months that can make the negotiation of a new commercial treaty clear and definite. All parties believe that Hull's remarks were made in response to the intimidation from Tokyo. Yesterday, Japanese officials said they would continue to take other actions against American interests in China. Secretary of State Hull also said that he did not know anything about the Treasury Department's discussion of increasing tariffs on Japanese goods. (According to reports, since the United States increased tariffs on German goods, German trade with the United States has almost been reduced to zero.) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters that he would study the import of Japanese gold, silver, and goods into the United States based on the abolition of the treaty. As for whether Morgenthau consulted with Secretary of State Hull before the U.S. notified the abolition of the treaty, it was not clearly revealed. However, according to sources in official circles, the two giants did consult beforehand, and the Treasury Department is now certain that the prices of Japanese goods sold in the United States are much lower than those in Japan. Also, between 1937 and 1938, Japan imported US$415 million worth of gold and US$4 million worth of silver into the United States. Therefore, public opinion has fiercely criticized the United States for providing foreign exchange to Japan and enabling Japan to use it to purchase arms. The Wednesday note of abolition was personally delivered to Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi by U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles. Although this may have been accidental, observers here believe that it has great significance. Welles's order to be transferred as Commissioner to the Philippines was only announced a few hours earlier, and the U.S. Philippine Islands are the target of Japan's southward advance. Since the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, the embargo on arms and other retaliatory actions have become legal. In the past, many people in the U.S. Congress believed that the embargo on arms would damage the spirit of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. This decision to abolish the treaty also happened at a time when the United States was greatly expanding its military. Although the reason why the U.S. government strengthened its naval and air forces in the Pacific has not been officially announced, this state of defense is a natural result of U.S.-Japan friction. Republican Senator Borah, the former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had repeatedly expressed his opposition to sanctions against Japan because they violated the spirit of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, but last night, after the commercial treaty was abolished, he also expressed his support. Borah said, "When the time is ripe in the future and there is an opportunity to ban the export of arms to Japan, I will definitely express my support for it, the same as my past attitude towards other belligerent countries (regardless of whether those countries have declared war). In short, supplying arms to neutral or belligerent countries is not only morally wrong, but also enough to involve the United States in the whirlpool of war." Diplomats here were surprised by President Roosevelt's adoption of a tough diplomatic policy and the sudden announcement of the abolition of the treaty. It is said that Roosevelt's plan is quite extensive in nature, and what has already been implemented is as follows: (1) Suddenly abolishing the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, causing an unexpected blow to Japan; (2) The President made a peace appeal to Hitler and Mussolini in March of this year; (3) The President suddenly transferred the U.S. fleet back to the Pacific; (4) In January of this year, the President sent a letter to the Senate and House of Representatives, threatening to impose practical sanctions on all aggressor countries. All parties firmly believe that the treaty abolition incident on Wednesday was aimed at sanctions. (American Associated Press dispatch, 28th)

### Like a Bolt from the Blue: Japan Tries to Maintain Calm; Foreign Ministry Issues Public Notice at Midnight, Hoping to Conclude a New Treaty with the United States

(Tokyo) All sectors of Japan were greatly shaken by the United States' sudden abandonment of the 1911 U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, which is now becoming more and more apparent. It is said that Foreign Minister Arita told a delegation from the House of Peers that he believed the United States' actions were related to protecting its interests in China. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

(Tokyo) The last words of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's midnight statement were, "If the U.S. government wants to conclude a new treaty with Japan to adapt to the new situation in East Asia, the Japanese government will gladly do so." This morning, when the Foreign Ministry hosted a press conference, a reporter raised this question, asking if it was a request. The spokesman replied that the new situation in East Asia naturally requires a new treaty. This is not a request, but an expectation. Currently, there are no plans to ask the United States to recognize the new situation in East Asia. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Arita reported to the Cabinet this morning on the U.S. government's notification of the abolition of the 1911 U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. According to reliable sources, the Japanese government will observe the development of the situation with a calm attitude. The government has formulated a policy to deal with the situation arising from the abolition of the treaty by the United States or other countries. The government does not intend to initiate a new treaty with the United States, but will adopt a wait-and-see policy. "Chugai Business News" stated that whether U.S.-Japan relations will be peaceful in the future depends entirely on the future actions of the U.S. government. The Japanese government and public should pay attention to the future actions of the U.S. government and formulate specific domestic and foreign policies to deal with emergencies. "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that the United States' abolition of the commercial treaty with Japan will not have a serious impact on Japan's overseas trade. However, the U.S. foreign policy after the abolition of the treaty should arouse Japan's preparation and determination. If the United States believes that the abolition of the treaty is enough to protect its rights in China, then its foolishness is beyond reach. "Asahi Shimbun" said that the United States' move provides Japan with the best opportunity to adjust its relations with the United States. Since the new situation in China has led to the adjustment of Anglo-Japanese relations, U.S.-Japan relations should also be adjusted. The government should take advantage of the United States' abolition of the treaty to find ways to conclude a new treaty with the United States to adapt to the new situation in East Asia. "Hochi Shimbun" advised the Japanese government to maintain calm, ascertain the motives of the United States, and pay attention to the various developments in the international situation after the United States' move. However, it must not abandon its existing position and must firmly carry out the construction of a new order in East Asia. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

(Tokyo) After the U.S. government announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the Japanese Foreign Ministry immediately released a statement from the Director of the Information Department at 00:00 on the 28th, explaining the Japanese government's views on this issue. The content of the statement is as follows:

The U.S. government formally notified the Japanese government of the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. However, the incident was sudden, and the reasons were simple. The U.S. intentions are unknown. According to the U.S. statement, the reason for the abolition of the treaty is that the U.S. government has studied whether it is necessary to change the commercial treaties concluded by the United States with various foreign countries in recent years. The result is the conclusion that the current U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation contains some clauses that need to be reconsidered. The U.S. government decided to abolish the current treaty in order to arrange for this consideration and to deal with new situations to protect U.S. interests. However, this reason of the U.S. government can also be a reason for revising the treaty. It has not been able to explain the reason why it had to suddenly notify the abolition. Although the U.S. government said that this decision to notify is not related to the issue of Republican Senator Vandenberg's proposal to abolish the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the U.S. move is easy to make people generally think that it must have a major political significance at a time when the United Kingdom and Japan are negotiating the Tianjin case in Tokyo. New situations are developing in the Far East with great momentum. The Japanese government has long hoped that all countries in the world will increase their proper understanding of this fact. If the U.S. government hopes to conclude a new treaty with Japan in response to this new situation in the Far East, the Japanese government is happy to prepare to respond to this hope, needless to say.

### The U.S. Government Uses Its Power to Maintain China's Independence: President Roosevelt's Strong Measures Receive Unanimous Support from National Public Opinion

(Washington) Regarding the U.S. government's sudden abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, members of Congress, including isolationists, unanimously praised it. Newspapers also unanimously expressed their support for Roosevelt's decisive measures. Political figures expect that the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty is the first step in the United States' adoption of a more active Far East policy. After Congress reconvenes early next year, a ban on arms exports to Japan may be announced. This proposal was put forward by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in the last Congress, but due to the existence of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, the discussion was postponed. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 28th)

(New York) The morning newspapers here recently commented on the U.S. government's abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, all of which were very satisfied, saying that this is the most important expression of the United States' encouragement of China's resistance to Japan since the outbreak of the Far East War, and the United States does not allow consideration of its subsequent impact. "The New York Times" stated, "The U.S. government's decision to take this action is very appropriate. At this critical juncture, the U.S. government's clear statement of its traditional policy towards the Far East is to enhance the strength of this policy. This action provides moral assistance to China. If the British government can adopt a stronger policy towards Japan, it will not be afraid that others will not support it. The United Kingdom and Japan are conducting negotiations in Tokyo. Japan intends to ask the United Kingdom to close the Yunnan-Burma Road to cut off China's supplies and thus achieve a major diplomatic victory. Now that the U.S. government has announced the abolition of the treaty, the position of the United Kingdom has naturally been strengthened. This action by the U.S. government is tantamount to issuing a statement to the Japanese government that our country, having undertaken the obligations of the Nine-Power Treaty, must recognize China's territorial and administrative integrity, sovereignty, and independence, and is prepared to use all its power, except resorting to war, so that China's territorial and administrative integrity, sovereignty, and independence are respected by everyone. The Japanese government also has no reason to doubt the firm support of the majority of the American people for the State Department's actions." "The New York Post" stated that American public opinion has no intention of "colluding with" Japan's murderous adventures, nor is it prepared to accept Japan's "beautiful Dunbarton" and sever diplomatic relations with it. Therefore, the abolition of the commercial treaty is the only correct way. Judging from the reaction in Tokyo, the Japanese military seems to be taking retaliatory measures in a short period of time. If so, the State Department authorities will have no time to draft a new commercial treaty. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 27th)

(Washington) The article in "The Washington Star" is sufficient to represent the reaction of American public opinion. It said, "The government's move will definitely be supported by the people of the country. American rights have been despised and protested repeatedly, but to no avail. The United States has shown extraordinary patience for two years. However, our citizens have been attacked repeatedly, and our legal rights based on treaties have been violated repeatedly. All of this should not be tolerated any longer. Even the fanatical warlords who hold power in Japan know this. In short, our patience has reached its limit." (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### British and American Far East Policies Proceed Along Parallel Lines: Britain May Follow the United States' Lead and Announce the Abolition of the Commercial Treaty with Japan

(London) According to information obtained by Reuters diplomatic correspondents, many people in the United Kingdom believe that the timing of the United States' abolition of the commercial treaty with Japan may have been chosen suddenly, but it is not entirely accurate to say that this is a surprising move, as this move indicates that British and American Far East policies are now proceeding along parallel lines, but the two governments have not attempted to mutually bind each other. This move by the United States has naturally caused all sectors of the United Kingdom to shift their thinking to consider the use of this method to protect their rights in the Far East, as the United Kingdom also concluded a commercial treaty with Japan in 1911. The United Kingdom certainly does not intend to hinder the success of the Tokyo talks, but if it feels it is necessary to emulate the United States in order to provide greater protection for British interests, the United Kingdom will also consider abolishing the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

(London) The Council of the British League of Nations Union today passed a resolution requesting the British government to follow in the footsteps of the United States and send a note to Japan to abolish the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### British Newspaper Commentary

(London) "The News Chronicle" commented today that President Roosevelt's measures in foreign policy have always been firm and often exciting, but none have been as great as this abolition of the commercial treaty with Japan. Whether this move results in an arms embargo or not, this abolition note is the most important political condemnation imposed on Japan, and it also provides timely encouragement to China, which is slightly troubled by Anglo-Japanese compromise. Whether President Roosevelt intended to do so or not, his abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty has given the British government a practical lesson in Far East policy. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

(London) The Manchester Guardian's editorial today stated that President Roosevelt's decision to abolish the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty is a warning that the United States will take more severe action. If the current situation continues, the American people will demand a halt to supplies to Japan, and without this supply, Japan will not be able to carry out its aggression against China. The Birmingham Post emphasized the indirect beneficial impact of the U.S. move on the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo, saying that the United Kingdom and the United States have obviously not yet acted in unison on Far East issues, but their steps are now closer. The Times's diplomatic correspondent said that a study of the original text of the U.S. abolition note shows that the Japanese military is destroying the spirit of the U.S.-Japan treaty. The 1911 Anglo-Japanese treaty is indeed similar to the U.S.-Japan treaty in many ways. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

(London) "The Daily Telegraph" editorial today asked that President Roosevelt, with his sudden decision to abolish the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, has shown the world that a democratic country can sometimes deal with an omnipotent country in unexpected strategies. The United States' move is only exercising the rights granted by the treaty, which is very different from Japan's past seven years of brazenly destroying any treaty obligations that conflict with its policies. Japan not only violates treaty obligations, but also seeks to evade the inconveniences that belligerent countries should have in law by avoiding a formal declaration of war against China, while at the same time demanding the conveniences that belligerent countries can have, as evidenced by the negotiations on the Tianjin issue. President Roosevelt's move will be a powerful warning that Japan cannot continue to take advantage of opportunities or destroy the rights of other countries without incurring early retaliation. If our observation is not wrong, then the time is gradually approaching when the United States will have to abandon its previous tolerant attitude when it encounters this new development. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Soviet Newspaper Criticizes British Policy: It Will Eventually Backfire

(Moscow) Moscow newspapers recently made their first criticism of the Anglo-Japanese compromise, saying that British concessions to Japan will make the aggressors in the Far East more greedy and promote the final elimination of British interests in the Japanese-occupied areas of China.

Editorial

### Capital Recovery Movement

Recently, the Shanghai financial market can be described as having exhausted the possibilities of extreme change! The volatile hearts of the people, after such repeated shocks, turn pale at the mention of a tiger, and rumors flourish. Originally intended to restrict withdrawals and tighten up cash, it unexpectedly promoted cash withdrawals and soaring discounts. Originally intending to tighten foreign exchange and prevent leaks, it unexpectedly made foreign currency expensive and gold rise. All of this backfired because the changes were too sudden, and the evolution was like rumors, so that the psychology of panic could not be controlled by reason. To say that this is the trouble of mediocre people is also due to the facts; to say that this is disregarding the overall situation, how can one know that it is not done for good? In short, merely blaming is not enough to solve the problem.

However, to invest in foreign exchange, buy gold, hoard cash, and transfer deposits to foreign banks, is it ultimately the safest way for our capital, or the most profitable way to handle it? Everyone knows that it is not entirely true. Because foreign exchange today has reached its extreme point, the value of one legal tender is only about four pennies, and the cost of one British pound is 56 legal tender, which has not been seen since the mutual trade between China and the West. From now on, will the price of British exchange shrink to three pennies, two pennies, or even one penny? If this is the case, then the price of currency will fall and the price of goods will rise. At that time, will the currency used be foreign exchange or legal tender? If it is still legal tender, then the benefits obtained will be very limited. Moreover, even without the support of foreigners, the value of legal tender will never fall again and again, even below four or three pennies. President Chiang Kai-shek once stated responsibly at the joint memorial week of the Central National Government on the 24th of this month, saying: "The government will definitely maintain the value of legal tender with all its strength, and will definitely maintain the ratio of legal tender to foreign exchange as much as possible. This is not a problem." From this, we can know that the value of legal tender will never fall again. Even if there are occasional changes in the black market, it will not damage the legal tender in the slightest.

As for the value of gold, it changes with foreign exchange. If the foreign exchange rate does not change, the price of gold will be stable. As for depositing in foreign banks, it is indeed true that they can deposit and withdraw cash without restrictions. If it is said that it has other guarantees, it is not necessarily true. Because those who deposit legal tender pay legal tender. If legal tender is worthless, then what is deposited in foreign banks will also be lost. And to allow cash to flow into the vaults of foreign banks, expanding their power to control the financial market, and destroying the decades of hard work of Chinese banks, is it not a pity? It is important to know that "the use of legal tender in the occupied areas has been fully prepared and will be firmly maintained, so as not to affect the livelihood of our people in the slightest, and not to cause our compatriots any loss," President Chiang Kai-shek has solemnly stated. Then, what doubts and fears can there be about the future of legal tender? Moreover, after several cash withdrawals, the strength of Chinese banks can also be tested. In the past two months, there has been a rush to withdraw cash, which is a fact that cannot be denied. However, Chinese banks can cope with it with ease, and there is absolutely no sign of being stretched. If they were not well prepared at ordinary times, how could they cope with this tense situation?

From this point of view, do not rely on foreign forces as reliable, and do not regard capital flight as reliable. Those who value reality have no long-term plans, and their high hats block their vision, which is similar to frogs at the bottom of a well. Do they really love us deeply? They only love our wealth. When the wealth is exhausted, they will also leave hopefully. As for those who become rich through speculation, they should hold their huge wealth as a small depositor in the wall street, but this situation is also difficult to last. If they have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of capital, considering their monthly income, it is not as good as a beggar in New York. Why are they so eager to escape? It is important to know that the survival of the future depends entirely on self-reliance; even the economic recovery also depends on self-reliance; without self-reliance, how can there be other power? If Britain continues to help us with foreign exchange, it is good, but even if it does not, we can only do our best to preserve the existing foreign exchange and generate future foreign exchange. However, what is closely related to this is our own financial problem. Finance is the mother of all businesses; a sound financial organization, solid credit, and the ability to fulfill its proper functions and not be manipulated by speculation are more than enough to develop industry and commerce and maintain society. If a huge amount of cash is deposited in foreign banks and invested in unproductive foreign currency and gold, it will not only increase the strength of foreign banks, but also drastically reduce the active capital of Chinese banks, which will inevitably hinder the financing and turnover of industry and commerce, leading to the decline of industry, the withering of finance, and the arrival of a general collapse and great panic. Who can be outside this circle? Therefore, only by allowing the financial sector to develop its original functions can the safety of capital be ensured. What we hope from the financial sector is that its every move, small enough to affect industry and commerce, and large enough to affect society, should be cautious beforehand, and meticulous afterwards. Do not take it lightly, and do not be too hasty. Any actions that can increase the trust of depositors are expected to be faithfully implemented; even for customers' improper uses, measures should be taken to restrict them. Profit is indeed valued by the financial sector, but we hope that it will take righteousness as profit, and take great profit and long-term profit as profit, and not take temporary small profit as profit.

What is hoped from the public is that, for the foreign currency and gold purchased and stored, how much higher can the future market price be than this? Why not calculate it? Which is more, when it is high or when it is low? If the market price in the future is better than it is today, then the gains will be abundant, but the risks will also be greater! Also, for the cash stored, do you hope to generate interest, or do you hope to be sealed waste paper? If money loses its circulation, its effectiveness is lost. However, the reason for hoarding cash is probably the inevitable consequence of changing the "August 13" stabilization of financial measures. From this, we can know that the credit of the financial sector cannot be neglected. A team of four horses cannot catch the tongue; how can one retract it again and again? Therefore, for the sake of the financial sector, there should be no more restrictions on withdrawals! For the sake of the general public, it is necessary to gather all its strength to deal with this extraordinary situation, and should not weaken the strength of the financial sector and hinder the survival in the struggle process. Understanding this, then returning the capital to the vaults of Chinese banks, so that it can fulfill its monetary functions and provide for the operation of the financial sector and the development of the industrial and commercial sectors, is indeed the way of economic self-reliance.

### Foreign Minister Wang Praises America's Sense of Justice As A Manifestation of Willingness to Maintain Prestige Regarding the Abolition of the US-Japan Treaty; Further Active Steps Could Restore International Order

(Chongqing) Foreign Minister Wang, regarding the United States' announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, made the following statement to foreign reporters on the 28th: The United States has always been known for its rich sense of justice, and China has a firm and unwavering belief in the American people. US Secretary of State Hull has now notified Japan that the provisions contained in the (1911) US-Japan Treaty of Commerce must be reconsidered, and that the treaty will be abolished after a six-month period. The US government's decision to do so shows that it must have fully considered the (great disorder in East Asia) caused by the Japanese warlords in politics and commerce. The announcement of this abolition can be regarded as an expression of the United States' willingness to maintain its position and prestige in the Pacific region. If the United States takes more concrete and active steps, doing everything within its power to curb international chaos and restore international peace, mutual trust, and goodwill, then it will be what we sincerely pray for. In fact, the United States can implement its decisive power over the peace of the Far East and other parts of the world without engaging in war. If the United States' strength, prestige, and public opinion can be clearly expressed, it will benefit international justice, law, and order. (28th dispatch)

### US President's Decisive Action Praised by Chinese Government and People

(Chongqing) Since the wartime capital received the US government's announcement of the abolition of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, the Chinese government authorities and the people have generally regarded this as the initial step taken by the US government to express its extreme concern for the situation in the Far East. Since Japan implemented its invasion of China, all friendly nations have exercised the greatest patience and watched its development quietly. The United States and Britain have repeatedly given friendly advice to Japan, but it has not only turned a deaf ear, but also intensified its actions to infringe on the interests of friendly nations in China, becoming increasingly proactive. Its intention is to fundamentally overthrow the position of the United States and Britain in the Far East. Recently, the incidents of Japanese troops insulting and persecuting expatriates in the occupied areas are too numerous to mention. President Roosevelt seems to have keenly felt that the actions of the Japanese side cannot be persuaded by empty words. He had no choice but to take the measure of abolishing the treaty of commerce to urge them to reflect. The Americas are the largest customer for Japanese exports, accounting for almost 70% of its total export value. If the United States and Japan become treaty-less states, the great impact on Japanese exports is something that cannot be calculated with numbers. The collapse of its economic foundations is only a matter of time. Moreover, Japan's needed cotton, pig iron, steel, gasoline, timber, etc. will all be cut off from their sources. There is no doubt that its military actions will be severely affected. The Tokyo and Osaka stock markets have already experienced a crash, which can give us a glimpse of the wavering hearts of the people. Although the abolition of the treaty will take effect six months later, before it takes effect, the US president also has the power to increase the import tax rate on Japanese goods or ban their import. Therefore, the second and third steps taken by President Roosevelt after the abolition of the treaty are even more closely watched by the world. The Chinese government and people all admire President Roosevelt's high-minded understanding and decisive determination in taking such decisive measures. The blow Japan has suffered in the past two years has been the most significant with this decision. There is a good possibility that this will become a fatal blow. Judging from the attitude expressed by various major newspapers in Japan, advising their citizens to remain calm, it can be seen that their internal panic cannot be compared to ordinary events. (28th dispatch)

(Chongqing) Chinese Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao told the Associated Press today that the Chinese government is extremely satisfied with the United States' abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, considering it the beginning of actively confronting Japan. The significance of this action by the United States is extremely noteworthy. The entire situation in the Far East depends entirely on the attitude of the US government. We are well aware that Japan will discriminate against the rights and interests of third countries in the Far East. If action is not taken quickly, the disaster will become even greater and beyond repair. The United States must take the lead in a rational adjustment of international relations in the future, and take other measures in the same direction. After a good example is set, other countries can follow suit. Weng also believed that Britain would continue to assist China. (28th Associated Press dispatch)

(Chongqing) All sectors of the Chinese people believe that the United States' abolition of the treaty of commerce and navigation with Japan will greatly enhance Britain's position at the Tokyo Conference. China is now hoping that Britain will take a tougher stance against Japan in the future. They also said that Britain may not take action beyond its vague declarations, which can be interpreted more broadly. Last night, people here were all discussing the news of the US's abolition of the treaty, with enthusiastic and pleasant emotions no less than when they received news of the victory at Taierzhuang in the past. This morning, all Chinese newspapers published this news in large characters, with headlines such as "Fatal Blow to Japan" and "New Shock in Tokyo." (28th Reuters dispatch)

(Chongqing) The United Daily News here commented today that the US's action to abolish the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce is enough to dispel China's ambiguity towards the United States since the postponement of the discussion on the US Neutrality Act. It is said that "Japan's munitions are supplied by the United States for the most part, but once the United States implements an arms embargo, it will be greatly hindered. An arms embargo is the most effective weapon to contain aggressors, and it will surely become the only weapon to maintain the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations. The United States' action this time also clearly shows that the United States is always trying to fulfill its obligations under international treaties, and also shows that the United States is paying attention to the shift in the situation in the Far East. At the same time, this action by the United States has also formed the same front with other peace-loving countries, further demonstrating the potential power of the United States to stop aggressors, and is also a kind of economic retaliation against Japan, and also shows the United States' determination to maintain its position in the Far East and promote world peace. The US's decision this time is also a manifestation of the improvement of China's international relations, but it is also the result of China's determination to continue the war of resistance."

### Tokyo Round Table Conference Britain Firmly Rejects Japanese Demands Opposes Banning Legal Tender in Concessions Refuses to Hand Over Silver Stored in Tianjin

(Tokyo) Today's British-Japanese round table conference convened for three hours and adjourned at 1:00 PM, with a decision to discuss it again on Monday morning. It is heard that the talks progressed smoothly today, and the discussion on monetary issues has been completed, but the nature of the decision is not yet known. The two sides then negotiated the handover of silver stored in the British concession in Tianjin and other matters. It is heard that yesterday morning's round table conference made considerable progress on maintaining peace and order in the British concession in Tianjin. However, the six-hour meeting in the afternoon failed to reach an agreement on the Japanese side's proposal to ban the circulation of legal tender in the concession. It is heard that during the meeting, the Japanese representative stated that the continued circulation of Chinese legal tender in the concession was the cause of economic disorder in North China, and the British side should strictly prohibit its circulation in accordance with the purpose of the Arita-Craigie agreement. However, the attitude of the British representative was the opposite, saying that the British government naturally supports the legal tender issued by the Chinese government, and as long as Britain continues to recognize the Chinese government, Britain will never agree to ban the use of legal tender. (28th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) Today's Japanese newspapers' reports on the Tokyo British-Japanese conference are contrary to the official statement that the conference is progressing smoothly in a friendly atmosphere. According to the newspapers, the British-Japanese conference has stalled due to Japan's demand that the British concession in Tianjin ban the circulation of Chinese legal tender and hand over the cash stored in various Chinese banks in the British concession. It is heard that although the US representative admitted that the Bank of Communications had silver worth 14 million yuan, it would not be handed over soon. The Japanese side then cited the Arita-Craigie agreement, demanding that the cash stored in the four banks of China, Communications, Agriculture, and Industry in the British concession in Tianjin be handed over to the "Provisional Government" of Peiping. The opinions of the two sides are very different. (28th Reuters dispatch)

### British-American Cooperation in the Far East Germany and Italy Worried About Japan

(Berlin) Regarding the United States' announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, political figures here believe that it is a political action. The newspapers in Berlin last night generally claimed that the purpose of this move by the United States was to help Britain, and at the same time believed that the United States would soon ban the shipment of munitions to Japan. The "Financial News" published an article titled "Sanctions War on the Pacific," stating that most US newspapers had long advocated a tough stance against Japan, and that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull had implemented it without waiting for the Senate's discussion in order to avoid Washington being drawn into "Britain's failure in the Far East." The newspaper believed that after the abolition of the Treaty of Commerce, the United States would follow up with an announcement of an embargo on munitions to Japan, which would have a significant impact on Japan, as 57% of all Japanese munitions currently come from the United States. The "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" also published an editorial, vigorously arguing that this move was the first result of British-American cooperation in the Far East. The newspaper stated that Britain has now retreated to Singapore in the Far East, and its position is largely dependent on assistance. The real motive for the United States to abolish the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce is to reverse the failure in Tianjin, but the newspaper believes that Japan will also take tough measures to resist it. (28th Huitong dispatch)

(Rome) After the US government abolished the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, Italian political figures felt extremely interested in the impact of this move on the future of the Far East, and said that this was the prelude to the US implementing tariff policies against Japan. Originally, the Japanese economy, especially the raw materials needed for industrial production, such as cotton, iron, and oil, were almost entirely dependent on US supply, and it would inevitably suffer a serious impact. It can be seen that the US measures are completely based on political considerations, that is, the authorities of that country want to exert pressure on the Japanese government.

Southern Shanxi Chinese Army Recovers Qinshui No Trace of Japanese East of Yicheng Taking Advantage of the Victory to Besiege Jincheng

(Xi'an) Military news: Most of the Japanese troops who broke out of Yangcheng retreated east to Jincheng, and some retreated north to Qinshui. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked the more than 2,000 Japanese troops in Qinshui from Yicheng. After a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. By the evening of the 26th, the Chinese army had recovered Qinshui, and the remaining Japanese troops collapsed and retreated northeast. The Chinese army captured a large amount of military supplies. At present, there is no trace of the Japanese on the line of Dongwuling and Longhua Town in the west of Qinshui and the east of Yicheng.

### Japanese Troops in Southern Henan Probe Tanghe

(Chongqing) Chinese military figures here are paying close attention to the activities of the Japanese troops in southern Henan on the Pinghan Railway, believing that the purpose of this decided attack by the Japanese troops is to suppress the Chinese army in the Dabie Mountains near Xinyang. According to news received by the Chinese side, Japanese cavalry artillery units and mechanized units have begun to advance westward from Minggang, 40 kilometers north of Xinyang, with a view to attacking Gushi in the southwest. Chinese military figures believe that the final purpose of the Japanese troops is to attack Tanghe on the border of Henan and Hubei. (28th Huitong News Agency dispatch)

(Luoyang) At 6:00 PM on the 27th, Minggang saw an increase of more than 3,000 Japanese infantrymen, more than 500 cavalrymen, more than 70 tanks, and 100 cars, dividing their forces to harass the southwest. One route went straight to Wagang (west of Minggang) to harass Biyang, and another route slanted towards Maoji (southwest of Minggang) to flank Biyang. The Chinese army has separately met them. The Japanese troops in Xinyang, after capturing Huaihedian to the west, continued to Yuehedian (west of Huaihedian) to attack Tongbai, to coordinate with the northern Japanese troops, and the Chinese forces have also flanked the Japanese back, launching a pincer attack.

### Long Yun Expresses Disappointment with Britain

(Kunming) Yunnan Chairman Long Yun told a Reuters reporter today that the Chinese government and people were both surprised and disappointed by the British signing of the Tokyo Memorandum. We have always regarded Britain as a party to maintaining justice, international law, and fairness. It is truly incomprehensible why it suddenly changed its attitude and complied with Japan's demands. It should be known that those who are adversely affected by it are not only limited to the Far East, but will also extend to the peace of the whole world. However, we are not completely disappointed by this preliminary compromise, because the final intention of the British people is still unknown. It is hoped that the good consciousness of the British people will have its own expression. This action of Britain will naturally have some psychological impact, which no one can deny. However, the determination of the Chinese government to resist will not be shaken in the slightest. We have a responsibility to defend our land. It would be good to obtain the assistance of friendly countries, but we must continue to struggle. Long also solemnly stated that the Japanese's baseless radio broadcasts, saying that the Yunnan Province and the Central Government have differences of opinion, are absolutely unfounded. The Yunnan Province not only fully supports the Central Government, but also remains loyal to the Central Government. Even before the country was unified, the Yunnan Province had expressed its support for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. At that time, I did my best to persuade other leaders to support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Since that was the case at that time, there is absolutely no reason not to support him now.

### Japanese Veteran Statesman Advises Countrymen Must Change Their Views on China - Yukio Ozaki Publishes Essay - Continuing This Way Will Inevitably Lead to a Deep Recession

(Hong Kong) Yukio Ozaki is a veteran statesman in Japan who advocates parliamentary politics and liberalism. Since Japan wanted to establish a parliamentary system, he has been elected as a member of the House of Representatives in every election without competition, and has also served as a member of the cabinet. During the era of party politics, the Japanese people hailed him as the "God of Constitutionalism." This old man, who is over eighty years old, has been very indignant about the dictatorship of the warlords in recent years. Whenever he has the opportunity, he tells his countrymen his views. Recently, Ozaki published an article in the July issue of "Japan Review" entitled "Policies Towards China and Europe," offering earnest advice to his country in light of the current situation. The full text is quite long, but unfortunately most of it has been censored and deducted by the military, and it is impossible to see the whole picture. Judging from the remaining part, Ozaki cited the expeditions of Chinese troops in the Yuan and Ming dynasties, saying that even the most powerful generals of that time were unable to subdue the Chinese troops, which shows that strength and weakness, prosperity and decline, are only temporary phenomena and not permanent. Today, although China is weak, it will eventually become strong, warning his countrymen that they must change their views on China. He also said that Japan has no inherent culture, and all Chinese characters come from China. The Japanese language has many homophones with different meanings. Without Chinese characters, there is no hope for the development of academics and everything else. He also cited evidence, saying that the elements of nation-building, "benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and filial piety," cannot be expressed with appropriate language without using Chinese characters. Even agricultural tools, sericulture, and textiles were all transmitted from China. Therefore, Japan owes a great deal to China, and his hints are very sharp. He also said that this year's budget is close to 10 billion yuan. When using borrowed money, the market naturally looks prosperous, but debts must be repaid, and repayment is naturally more painful than use. The Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War in the past both led to extremely deep recessions after the war, which can serve as a warning. Yuan troops went on an expedition and encountered a storm, and the entire army was wiped out. This was God's blessing. The Russo-Japanese War ended due to internal strife in Imperial Russia and the mediation of the US president. Moreover, the war expenses used at that time were all borrowed from Jewish people ("pointing to the Jewish capitalists of the United States"), so there was not much worry. The situation is very different today. If we continue to move forward in this way, there will be almost no end date. The lines fully express his sincere concern for the country. Finally, Ozaki also discussed the situation in Europe, but because it was all deleted, there is no way to know its general meaning. From this, it can be seen that Japanese politicians with foresight are very worried about their country's future, and at the same time, their understanding of China is diametrically opposed to that of their military. Under heavy pressure, Ozaki still dared to express his views on his conscience, which is truly commendable, and the Japanese people, who have been deceived by their military, will inevitably have deep feelings and reflection.

### The Anti-British Movement in North China Is Underway

(Tientsin) British residents in Tientsin who reside in areas under Japanese influence have recently received a mailed notice from the Anti-British National Salvation Association, advising the British to leave Tientsin quickly to save their lives. The notice stated, "You must know that the era of the British Empire's long history of aggression is now completely collapsing. The yellow race is gradually awakening, and there is an anti-British movement. Our organization is well-established and has decided to resist the British with iron and blood. If you are wise, you should leave Tientsin immediately to preserve your lives." (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)

### Vagrant Japanese Cause Disturbance at French Barracks in Tangku

(Hong Kong) Tientsin news. On the 24th, Japanese troops in Tangku instigated over a thousand vagrant ruffians to hold an anti-British rally. In the meeting place, a villain suddenly shouted the slogan "Down with France." The vagrants immediately flocked to the gate of the French barracks in Tangku. After the French soldiers defended, the two sides were deadlocked for a long time. The Tientsin French garrison authorities, upon hearing the news, dispatched troops to rush to the scene and dispersed them. It has been found that the Japanese side initially targeted both the British and French sides regarding the Tientsin concession issue. Later, they focused solely on the British. Recently, due to British concessions, they are now targeting the French, employing a divide-and-conquer strategy. (Telegraph from the 28th)

### Flooding Occurs in North China; The Marco Polo Bridge Has Been Damaged; Guerrilla Warfare in the Suburbs of Peking Is Even More Vigorous; Japanese Military Operations Have Been Halted

(Peking) North China has been experiencing continuous torrential rain, and the river waters have risen significantly. Japanese military operations have been halted. Of the four railways departing from Peking, only the Peking-Mukden Railway is still operational. The other three are mostly submerged. The Yung-ting River near Peking has risen by ten feet, and the famous Marco Polo Bridge, where the war began, has been damaged by the water. Tung-chow, east of Peking, is six feet underwater. Hundreds of houses in Peking and its suburbs have collapsed, and several people have died. This situation has emboldened the guerrillas in the Peking area to fight even more vigorously. On Sunday, twenty miles northwest of Peking, they attacked a Japanese outpost, killing ninety Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, two hundred guerrillas advanced to the gates of Peking, abducting twenty-eight Chinese police employed by the Japanese authorities and wealthy Chinese residents to be held for ransom. By the time Japanese troops arrived, the guerrillas had already left. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

(Tientsin) It is reported that the Japanese authorities have stated that ships sailing out will no longer need to dock at the Dairen pier for inspection. This is because the Hai River's water level has risen and the current is swift, making it difficult for ships to dock alongside the pier. The Jardine Matheson and Co.'s "Hsieh Hsing" (transliteration) and the Hai-k'ou vessels, which had departed from the Bund in the British concession today, reversed their course to the Dairen pier. After the inspection was completed, they were proceeding upstream. However, with their sterns still tied to the Bund in the British concession and before they could turn around, the cables suddenly snapped, preventing them from sailing out. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

(London) According to reports received by the British Foreign Office, North China has recently been hit by a series of storms, and the river waters have flooded, greatly hindering military operations. The Japanese are unable to utilize the four railways they occupy, except for the Peking-Mukden line, which is still passable. Chinese guerrillas took advantage of the flooding to attack Peking, engaging in battles with Japanese troops thirty-five miles northwest of Peking, and there are reports that they approached the gates of Peking.

### British and French Military Representatives Have Been Appointed and Are Preparing to Go to Moscow for Discussions; Molotov Meets with the British and French Ambassadors Again; Political Opinions Remain Divided

(Paris) Well-informed sources here recently declared that regarding the talks between the staff officers of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, the governments of the United Kingdom and France may issue a joint communiqu√© tonight, stating that the current negotiations between the three countries have made sufficient progress politically, and that the talks between the staff officers of the three countries can begin in the shortest possible time. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 28th)

(London) The staff officers of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union will begin talks in the near future. According to sources close to the War Office, the British government originally intended to appoint Air Chief Marshal Newall as the chief representative. However, because the issues to be discussed by the staff officers are complex and cannot be resolved in a short period of time, and Newall has important duties in Shanghai, making it inconvenient for him to remain abroad for a long time, it has been decided to appoint General Chatwode instead. He currently has no fixed duties and can stay in Moscow for a longer period of time. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 27th) (Paris) The representatives of the staff officers of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union will hold talks in Moscow. According to responsible sources, the French government has appointed General Doumenc as its representative to participate in the talks. General Doumenc served as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army in 1932 and is currently the commander of the garrison in Lille. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 27th)

(Moscow) Regarding the signing of a mutual assistance agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held talks with French Ambassador Naggiar (and British Ambassador Sir Seeds and Mr. Strang, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office) again at 5:00 PM today, lasting for ninety minutes.

It is expected that consultations will continue for another day or two. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 27th)

### The Relationship Between the United Kingdom and Germany Is Delicate; Hitler Meets with a British Newspaper Magnate; There Is Talk of Internal Differences of Opinion on the United Kingdom in Germany

Berchtesgaden, Germany. F√ºhrer Hitler recently met with British newspaper magnate Lord Kemsley at his villa here. Dietrich, the head of the information department of the German Foreign Office, was also present. Lord Kemsley is the publisher of the London Sunday Times and the Daily Sketch. Before coming to Germany from the United Kingdom, he had several meetings with Prime Minister Chamberlain. His visit to F√ºhrer Hitler is likely to convey Prime Minister Chamberlain's views on the European situation. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 27th)

(London) Reports state that the government has decided to replace the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson. Responsible sources have denied this. It is possible that Ambassador Henderson is physically unwell and may retire. As of now, the cabinet has not made a decision to replace the German ambassador. Such a proposal will only be considered if necessary in the coming weeks. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 28th)

(Berlin) It is widely rumored here that Aviation Minister and Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan, General G√∂ring, intends to obtain a large loan from abroad to transform the country's economic structure, shifting it from a wartime footing back to a peacetime one. It is also rumored that Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have expressed their opposition, leading to disagreements. To this day, the rift between the two sides has become increasingly apparent due to the fact that Walther, an advisor to the German Ministry of Economics, is conducting negotiations with British officials in London. According to reliable sources, Walther obtained G√∂ring's consent to conduct an investigation in London on certain issues. Goebbels and Ribbentrop believe that Germany should not show weakness to the democracies, and that if Germany maintains a firm stance, Britain will eventually yield. Therefore, Goebbels instructed the newspapers to do their best to publicize, in order to make the German people believe that the British government's talks with Walther are proof that Britain is on its last legs and that Germany should adhere to its demands. Once these articles were published, hopes for a beneficial rapprochement between Germany and Britain were dashed. General G√∂ring is extremely dissatisfied and has expressed his displeasure. It is likely that F√ºhrer Hitler will personally intervene to mediate. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 27th)

### The British Parliament Will Adjourn on Schedule; Chamberlain Will Give Another Speech

(London) The House of Commons was originally scheduled to hold a debate on foreign policy on August 2nd, but it has now been decided to advance it to July 31st. At that time, Prime Minister Chamberlain will deliver an important speech on the Far East issue and the current negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that he will announce the date for the resumption of Parliament in the autumn next week. He intends to move that Parliament adjourn on August 2nd and, in accordance with custom, authorize the Speaker to convene Parliament earlier if necessary. Labour Party leader Greenwood asked whether the Prime Minister had considered the suggestion that the House of Commons should meet on schedule and that members should not be away for long. Chamberlain replied that although this suggestion had not been formally proposed, he had seen it in the newspapers. After considering it, he felt that this move was not appropriate, as it might cause nationwide anxiety. Liberal Party leader Sinclair said that there was a possibility of serious events occurring abroad, and that it was inappropriate for Parliament to adjourn for a long period of time at this time. Chamberlain replied that he believed the only reasonable course of action was for the government to monitor the development of events and exercise its functions with a sense of responsibility, which Parliament could rely on. Chamberlain continued to reply to Greenwood, saying that he did not want to be bound by a promise, but in a broad sense, if the government intended to make major changes to its foreign policy, he would consult with Parliament. Churchill asked whether the Prime Minister thought it would be appropriate to declare Parliament adjourned until October 25th if the German army mobilized in early August. Chamberlain replied that this was a hypothetical question. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

(London) Well-informed sources claim that the Cabinet has decided that the date of resumption will be September 19th, at the latest September 26th. (According to custom, the House of Commons should not resume until October). In addition, regarding the issue of the general election in the House of Commons, if the international situation permits, the election will be held on November 10th. In that case, the election campaign will begin on October 25th. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

### The New Dutch Cabinet Abruptly Collapses Yesterday; The Motion of No Confidence by the Opposition Party Has Been Passed by Parliament

The Hague. The new Dutch cabinet, formed just two months ago, has now resigned after failing to obtain a vote of confidence from Parliament. It is reported that Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands may entrust the Catholic Party and the Socialist Party to form a coalition cabinet. (Hai-Tung Press dispatch, 28th)

The Hague. The majority party in Parliament, the Catholic Party, and the Radical Party today proposed a motion of no confidence in Dr. Colijn's new government, which was then put to a vote and passed by a vote of fifty-five to twenty-seven. The Catholic Party, the Socialist Party, the Radical Party, the Christian Radical Party, and the Communist Party all voted against the government. After the vote, Parliament adjourned to allow the government to consider its position. It is expected that Colijn will submit his resignation. The Catholic Party leader, Taekes, proposed the motion of no confidence, arguing that the organization of the "business" cabinet violated the public interest because it did not rely on the majority of the lower house and violated the constitution. Prime Minister Colijn then rose to defend himself, saying that it did not conflict with the constitution and that, given the difficulty of the current financial situation, there was no other way. He stated that if Parliament could clearly express its views and indicate its willingness to provide a majority of people on which another cabinet could rely, he would resign. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, the opposition's motion of no confidence was passed. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)

### Fierce Fighting on the East Bank of the Halha River; Japanese Troops Suffer Heavy Losses; Soviet-Mongolian Forces Hold Their Original Positions

(Moscow) The command of the Mongolian-Soviet forces of the Mongolian People's Republic recently issued a communiqu√© stating that from July 23rd to 25th, Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops repeatedly launched attacks in an attempt to seize the positions of the Mongolian-Soviet forces on the east bank of the Halha River, but were all repulsed by the Mongolian-Soviet forces and suffered extremely heavy losses.

### Main Terms of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty

The Continental Daily News reports that the United States notified Japan on Wednesday of its decision to abolish the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. This marks the death knell for the treaty, which has been in effect for 28 years, and it will be invalidated six months after the notification, on January 26, 1940. This sudden move by the United States, according to opinions gathered in Shanghai yesterday (the 27th), will bring about the complete termination of all formally recognized trade relations between the US and Japan. This situation is unparalleled, except for the period from 1919 to 1933 when the United States did not recognize the Soviet Union. The US-Japan Treaty of Commerce was signed in Washington, D.C., on February 21, 1911, during the presidency of William Howard Taft, by Secretary of State Philander C. Knox and Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Baron Uchida K≈çsai. The US Senate amended and approved it on February 24. The US President and the Japanese Emperor ratified it successively on March 2 and March 31, and it was initialed in Tokyo on April 4 and announced the following day. The treaty includes the following eighteen articles: (1) Trade, travel, residence, and taxation; (2) Inviolability of residences; (3) Consular officials; (4) Freedom of mutual commerce and navigation; (5) Import and export duties; (6) Transit duties; (7) Companies; (8) Equality of shipping; (9) Privileges for ship docking and loading; (10) Nationality of ships; (11) Tonnage taxes; (12) Postal ships; (13) Coastal trade; (14) Most-favored-nation treatment; (15) Patents, trademarks, and designs; (16) Replacement of the 1894 conditions; (17) Effectiveness and duration; (18) Ratification.

Among these eighteen articles, the first, third, fourth, fifth, and fourteenth are most relevant to the current situation in the Far East. These four articles include the following provisions:

Article 1: Nationals of each contracting party shall have liberty to enter the territories of the other, to travel and reside therein, to carry on wholesale and retail trade, to own or lease and occupy houses, factories, warehouses and shops, to employ agents of their choice, to lease land for residential and commercial purposes, and generally to do anything incidental to or necessary for trade upon the same terms as native nationals, submitting to the local laws and regulations. They shall not be compelled to pay any taxes or duties other or higher than those paid by native nationals. Nationals of each contracting party shall, within the territory of the other, conform to the conditions imposed upon native nationals, and shall receive the most constant protection and security for their persons and property, and shall enjoy the same rights as native nationals, but shall be exempt from compulsory military service, whether in the army or navy, or in the regular army or national guard or militia, and from all contributions imposed in lieu of personal service, and from all compulsory loans or requisitions.

Article 3: Each contracting party may send to the other consuls-general, consuls, vice-consuls, and consular agents to reside in such parts, cities, and places of the other as may be agreed upon.

Any such government may also object to receive such officer if such officer be objectionable to it, but if such other party shall not object to receiving such officer, it shall not be treated less favorably than similar officers of other countries. Such consuls-general, consuls, vice-consuls, consular agents, and consular representatives, upon receiving exequaturs or other sufficient authorizations from the government of the country to which they are appointed, shall, on condition of reciprocity, have the right to exercise the functions and to enjoy the exemptions and immunities which are or may hereafter be granted to consular officers of like grade of the most favored nation. The government issuing such exequatur or other authorization reserves the right to cancel it in its discretion, but shall state to the other party the reasons for which it thought proper to do so.

Article 4: There shall be between the territories of the two contracting parties reciprocal freedom of commerce and navigation. The nationals of each, equally with those of the most favored nation, shall have liberty freely to come with their ships and cargoes to all places, ports and rivers of the other which are or may hereafter be opened to foreign commerce, subject always to the laws of the country to which they so come.

Article 5: No other or higher duties of customs, on the importation into the territories of either of the contracting parties of any article, the growth, produce, or manufacture of the territories of the other, than are or shall be payable on like articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any other foreign country. Nor shall any other or higher duties or charges be imposed in either country on the exportation of any article to the territories of the other, than such as are or shall thereafter be payable on the exportation of the like article to any other foreign country. Nor shall any prohibition be imposed by either country on the importation of any article from the territories of the other, which shall not equally extend to the importation of the like article from any other country. Nor shall any prohibition be imposed by either country on the exportation of any article to the territories of the other, which shall not equally extend to the exportation of the like article to any other country. But this provision shall not apply to prohibitions or restrictions maintained or imposed as sanitary measures or for purposes of protecting animals and useful plants.

Article 14: Except as otherwise expressly provided in this treaty, the high contracting parties agree that, in all that concerns commerce and navigation, any privilege, favor, or immunity which either high contracting party has actually granted, or may hereafter grant, to the citizens or subjects of any other state, shall be extended immediately and unconditionally to the citizens or subjects of the other high contracting party; it being their intent that the citizens or subjects of each high contracting party shall enjoy, in the territories of the other, treatment in all respects as favorable as that which is or may be granted to citizens or subjects of the most favored nation.

### Chinese Troops Active Everywhere; Japanese Troops in Hangzhou Retreat to Jiaxing; Puppet Pacification Army Deployed to Hangzhou

Hangzhou Correspondence: In Xiecun, near Tanglou, and Dongtang Town, sixteen miles west, there are over a hundred well-equipped regular troops who ambushed the Japanese Miyajima unit. After a fierce battle, the Japanese troops were routed, suffering many casualties. In Qili area, the Japanese Itou unit was attacked by Chinese troops carrying ten machine guns. The Japanese commander, Lieutenant Hozhou, was seriously wounded and died on the spot. The Tsuchiya unit was attacked by a company of Chinese troops in Mahu Mountain. There were also over sixty Chinese troops active in Ding Shanhe. Japanese troops passing through the area were often severely attacked. At the same time, Chinese troops were active in Changshanmen, Pengjiabu, the Third Cemetery, Lixi Lake, Wengjia Mountain, and other places. Therefore, the highest commander of the Japanese troops in Hangzhou considered Hangzhou to be the most active area for guerrilla warfare and has already transferred the cavalry to Jiaxing, with the headquarters following suit. The puppet pacification army of Xu Pucheng has been deployed to Hangzhou, with the headquarters located in the Bank of China building on Anpo Bridge.

Jiaxing Correspondence: Chinese troops in the suburbs of Xiashi have become increasingly active recently, leading to fierce battles in the surrounding villages in recent days. It is learned that at about 10 a.m. on the 26th, two Chinese soldiers, disguised as farmers, sailed a boat into the town from a certain place. When they docked at the pier, four Japanese soldiers happened to be patrolling the area. The two soldiers seized the opportunity to draw out wooden-cased pistols and ambush them, killing all four Japanese soldiers. They then captured the weapons and ammunition carried by the Japanese soldiers, boarded the boat, and safely retreated. Subsequently, the Japanese authorities in the town learned of the incident and, in addition to cremating the four corpses nearby, announced a special state of emergency and, together with the puppet police, conducted a house-to-house search in all four suburbs, but found nothing.

In Xieqiao Town, which belongs to Haiyan County, more than 100 Japanese soldiers recently (on the 25th) attacked the Chinese army positions in a certain area of the town's outskirts. The Chinese regular army stationed there, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered the soldiers to lie in ambush midway. When the Japanese troops went deeper into that place, they were attacked with machine guns and grenades. The Japanese troops, realizing that they had fallen into an ambush, panicked and tried to escape, but ultimately, due to the unfavorable terrain, none of the Japanese troops survived. In this battle, the Chinese side suffered about ten casualties.

The Japanese army camp in Puyuan Town, which belongs to this county and Jiaxing, suffered a disastrous defeat in an attack by the Chinese army on the 21st. They immediately telegraphed the Japanese army authorities in the three counties of Tongxiang, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, requesting reinforcements to be stationed there. More than 300 Japanese soldiers were dispatched from the three places, and fortifications were hastily built in the strategic passes in the outskirts of the town. This was learned by the Chinese side, who launched an attack in three routes again on the evening of the 24th. The Japanese sentries immediately reported to the Japanese camp. The Japanese army, upon hearing the news, immediately dispersed and stubbornly resisted, but after a fierce charge by the Chinese army, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. The Chinese side, having achieved its mission, destroyed the Japanese fortifications and retreated.

It is learned from Jiaxing and Jiashan that Chinese troops sneaked into the Jiuli Hui area from the defense lines on the 25th late at night, and blew up the bridge near Qixingqiao Station with a large amount of explosives, and pried up the rails for about a li. It is said that when the work was in progress, the Japanese soldiers guarding the railway saw the situation and, due to the disparity in numbers, did not dare to attack. They urgently telegraphed Jiashan Station, but the long-distance telegraph lines had already been cut in advance, so they could not be connected. Therefore, the Chinese side carried out the work leisurely. The next day, the Japanese army forcibly searched the residents in the area and forced them to repair the railway.

### Kazuo Aoyama Discusses the Crisis of Japan's Future: The Nara Buddha Image Will Be Sacrificed Due to Lack of Materials

Chongqing Correspondence: It is heard that the New Shu Daily published a translation by Mr. Shen Qiyu, authored by Kazuo Aoyama, entitled "A Domestic Crisis." The following is a transcription:

Since the beginning of this year, the Korean Volunteer Corps, which we planned and participated in, has been participating in the armed regular army warfare and guerrilla warfare of the Chinese army.

On the one hand, the anti-war work has also shifted from general work to centralized work. In Wuhan, the planned anti-war movement of the Japanese army was successful. In the future, we will work harder to carry out the anti-war work.

In Japan, the general anti-war people have also begun to concentrate on political struggles. Therefore, the merger of the fascist "Eastern Society" and "Social Mass Party" is fundamentally impossible. At the same time, the Japanese fascist forces are generally in a state of division. The Kwantung Army faction, the North China Army faction, and the Central China and South China factions are engaged in open and secret struggles. The Hiranuma cabinet, which is forced between these two factions, often wavers and is unstable. The reason why this cabinet is powerless both internally and externally, and yet there is no phenomenon of cabinet collapse, is precisely because the fascist forces are mutually divided and engaged in infighting.

In addition, from the material point of view, it is also extremely lacking due to the war. The degree of lack has reached the point where they want to destroy the famous Nara Buddha statue in order to obtain copper and gold supplements. The value of the Buddha statue is currently under investigation.

In terms of the replenishment of the army, Japan is also in extreme difficulty. The people who remain in Japan are all physically unable to be soldiers. It is said that the ratio of men to women in this year has reached the ratio of one man to twenty women. In Kyushu, although there is an organization called the "Youth League," most of these organizations are "empty" and there are no members.

From the industrial point of view, only military industries exist now. There are 1.3 million unemployed workers in the country who belong to peaceful industries. At present, because the Japanese government forces the export of food such as milk, eggs, and sugar to foreign countries in order to obtain military expenses, food is also extremely insufficient. What is even more serious is that Japan has recently promulgated the "National Requisition Order," which is considered to have forced the "corv√©e" (pulling laborers), which China has already eliminated, on the entire Japanese population.

### Chinese Troops Recapture Xia Shu

Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Chen Regiment of the Chinese army in Zhenjiang, after being thoroughly trained by the New Fourth Army, has become a strong and powerful force. The other day, 150 soldiers of the regiment took advantage of a strong wind and rain to dash towards Xia Shu. Ma Long, under the command of Li Changjiang, the puppet army, was suddenly attacked. The puppet army fled in panic in the dark and 18 were annihilated, Ma Jinlong was seriously injured, and the rest scattered. Xia Shu town was recaptured. The next day, they advanced to Yingfangkou, northeast of Xia Shu, and attacked the Japanese military police headquarters. Ten military police were killed on the spot and more than 30 rifles were seized.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Xinghua Repeatedly; Dongtai Also Affected

Taixian Correspondence: In recent days, Japanese aircraft have been wreaking havoc in various counties in northern Jiangsu. At 8 a.m. on the 25th, the Taixian Air Defense Office reported that three Japanese aircraft were found in Yong'an Town, and an emergency alarm was immediately issued. It was lifted at 9:40 a.m. According to telephone news from Xinghua, the three aircraft flew from Yong'an into the airspace of Xinghua and dropped seven or eight bombs. The bombed locations included: (1) the Unified Tax Bureau, (2) an egg factory outside the East Gate, (3) a salt warehouse, (4) Zhaoyang Elementary School, (5) the County Middle School, and behind a photo studio. Subsequently, they flew from Qintong to Dongtai and dropped six or seven bombs, passing through the northwest of this county and returning to Yangzhou. Casualties and destroyed houses are currently under investigation.

### Chinese Troops Active in the Occupied Areas of Jiangsu Province

Wujin Correspondence: Since the regular army infiltrated the occupied counties of Jiangsu Province and reorganized the guerrillas in various places, taking the opportunity to attack, the weather has been hot recently, and they have been using the dark nights to work. In the past half month, the Japanese army has been suffering from running around. For example, on July 14, He Keqian's troops in Jijiashi, Jingjiang, and the guerrillas in Yu Dongzhen, Hong Shouzi near Nantong, fought fiercely with the Japanese army. On the 17th, the puppet pacification team in Pengzhen Town, Kunshan, and Qianmentang Town fought with the guerrillas, and the puppet team was defeated. On the 20th, Yang Wei, the commander of the Chinese army, led the Patriotic Salvation Army to attack the Japanese army in Lu Jiaqiao and Qiqi, Changshou Huangtang, Jiangyin, inflicting heavy casualties on them. On the 22nd, a unit of the New Fourth Army near Xixiashu Town in Wujin attacked the Wuyi Road and engaged in an encounter battle with the Japanese army, inflicting considerable losses on them before retreating.

### Bandits Everywhere in the Suburbs of Suzhou, Now Vigorously Suppressed by Chinese Troops

Suzhou Correspondence: Before the incident, most of the people in this county took refuge nearby, but there were robbery cases in the villages every day. The puppet police, limited by their strength, turned a deaf ear and pretended that nothing had happened. The Japanese army did not ask or hear about it. Recently, since the Chinese troops crossed the river and arrived in this county, the bandits in the villages are no longer as active as they used to be. It is heard that the Chinese army is also engaged in suppressing bandits because the Japanese army has abandoned the strategic points in the suburbs.

### Beggar Rehabilitation Education: Great Results Achieved in Three Months of Implementation; More Than 500 People Now Have Productive Skills

The authorities of the First Special District of this city, in order to improve the city's appearance, arrested more than 1,400 beggars who were wandering on the streets within the district and opened a beggar asylum in the International Second Reception Center on West Amherst Road to provide them with shelter. At that time, there were several university graduates mixed among them, which aroused deep attention from the community. Many people went to the asylum to visit them. Later, after adopting the suggestions of the education community of this city, the main reasons for the fall of each beggar were thoroughly investigated, and they were given rehabilitation education and productive skills, in order to start a new life. It is learned that more than three months have passed since the implementation of rehabilitation education, and most of the beggars have been sent back to their hometowns by the French Concession authorities one after another.

Special Edition of National Standard Monosodium Glutamate
‚Äì Inscribed by Yu Qiaqing

### A Word on Taste

‚Äì The Editor

Only a nation that strives for self-sufficiency can become prosperous today. Our nation has a vast domestic market for self-supplied goods, but the standards are not yet met. We have abundant domestic raw materials for self-sufficient manufacturing, but the methods are not yet scientific. Knowledgeable people lament this.

Improving the quality standards of domestic goods and improving manufacturing methods cannot be delayed. In the case of monosodium glutamate, the efforts of patriotic individuals have not been lacking in the past. They have replaced foreign goods that flooded the market with domestic products, reclaiming many rights and interests. However, in terms of quality and quantity, there is still room for improvement in quality, and there is still potential for greater universality in quantity. Therefore, there is an urgent need for entrepreneurs who are in line with the times to gather the greatest perseverance and bring together domestic chemical experts and experienced technicians to manufacture the latest monosodium glutamate to meet the needs of the Chinese people, improve the status of domestic monosodium glutamate, and meet the highest standards. It should be made into a food that everyone needs because of its practical quality that benefits the stomach and intestines and promotes health. It should also make foreign goods disappear from the monosodium glutamate trade market. Therefore, we have compiled a special issue of the Standard Factory to allow the Chinese people to clearly understand the general outline of the Standard Factory and encourage all sectors to pay attention to domestic monosodium glutamate, and to provide good-intentioned supervision and cultivation at any time.

Mr. Yao Junzhi, the general manager of Standard Factory, not only devotes himself to industry, but also is enthusiastic about promoting education. He is especially willing to sympathize with talented and ambitious students who are unable to further their studies. He has proposed to offer an annual scholarship of 1,000 yuan from the factory's "Nine Flavors One" revenue. Although the amount is not very large, Mr. Yao's hard work should be praised by all sectors. Detailed information can be obtained by writing to the factory.

‚Äì Yao Junzhi

Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four essential elements of life. They cannot be dispensed with, nor can one fail to seek self-sufficiency. This is a problem that modern countries are paying close attention to. Before China had trade with Europe and the United States, it was diligent in farming and weaving and was able to be self-sufficient. However, with the import of foreign goods, their novelty in quality and the sophistication of their manufacturing were widely promoted, which made Chinese products appear inferior. The Chinese people's psychology of admiring foreign goods became a habit. Even in the slightest matters of diet and daily life, they would worship foreign goods and rely solely on foreign goods. The outflow of rights and interests cannot be counted. Since the War of Resistance, patriotic individuals in the domestic goods industry have focused on saving the country through production. They have seized the opportunity to rise up, burying their heads in hard work. Heavy and light industries in various places have made considerable progress. However, the August 13th Incident broke out in Shanghai, and factories in the suburbs were almost completely destroyed. Only a few survived in the concession areas. At this time, developing domestic goods, increasing production, and relieving unemployment are the most important responsibilities for us to strengthen the economic power of the rear. However, difficulties arise one after another, and success is not easy. Only Junzhi believes that in order to start a business, in addition to capital and talent, one must have "spirit." There is a saying that spirit is the mother of business. Those who can overcome all setbacks and persevere tirelessly must have great perseverance. In other words, those who possess the spirit of entrepreneurship must always use their clear and decisive thinking, broad and sharp vision, and self-motivated spirit to serve society and work hard for the cause. Any environment cannot shake their will. Moreover, we should consider things from a broad and long-term perspective, and not focus on immediate interests. We should aim to improve products, raise domestic standards, recover rights and interests, and enrich people's livelihood, so that we can promote the prestige of domestic products and make up for any losses. Junzhi has been engaged in the new pharmaceutical industry for sixteen years. In recent years, in view of the urgent need for domestic monosodium glutamate and the fact that inferior products that are mixed with water and disregard commercial ethics are flooding the market, making it difficult for customers to choose and their trust is declining, he felt that there was a need to remedy this. Therefore, he gathered chemical experts and other professionals to research how to improve it and make the raw materials, quality, and packaging meet the standards they should have. It will open up a bright new path for domestic monosodium glutamate. Therefore, after three months of day and night of active preparation, the first factory was completed. Products such as "Nine Flavors One" and "Fresh King" have also been launched on the market one after another. Junzhi is ashamed of his lack of knowledge. He can be said to be completely ignorant of the traditional monosodium glutamate. He relies on the guidance of advanced people from all walks of life and the efforts of all colleagues to achieve success. In the future, he will make greater efforts to contribute to the preparation of domestic monosodium glutamate and amino acid derivatives, and will continue to work tirelessly to make the domestic status shine internationally. He hopes that advanced people from all walks of life at home and abroad will give guidance from time to time to help him overcome his shortcomings.

### The Freshness and Plant Protein

‚Äì Dr. Zhao Jintao, Pharmacology

The reason why food has a fresh taste is because it contains fresh quality. The amount of fresh quality determines whether the taste is good or bad. This fresh quality is d-Glutamic Acid. Glutamic acid comes from protein. After this substance is hydrolyzed, it produces a variety of amino acids. Glutamic acid is one of the amino acids. Proteins are divided into animal and plant proteins. Fish and meat are animal proteins, while gluten and tofu are famous plant proteins. Animal proteins often do not contain as much glutamic acid as plant proteins, but the latter must be chemically decomposed to obtain a large amount of glutamic acid. Therefore, monosodium glutamate is made from plant protein and is regarded as a luxury item in the past. Now, it is as important as oil and soy sauce and is an indispensable necessity for daily cooking. The reason why monosodium glutamate is what it is today can be attributed to two things:

One is the skillful use of applied chemistry, and the other is the emphasis on the art of living. Glutamic acid was discovered in 1868 by the German Rittbausen, who used sulfuric acid to decompose plant protein to obtain it. At that time, it was only a scientific discovery, but he did not know how to use it to make it practical. Who knew that fifty years later, Eastern people would use it as a daily necessity to directly increase personal appetite and enjoyment, and indirectly increase the health and prosperity of the nation? This is indeed the result of skillfully using chemistry, but it is also the result of the Eastern people's emphasis on the art of living. From this, it can be seen that although Western science is prosperous, the art of living is far inferior to that of the Eastern people. This is also a manifestation of the strengths of Eastern and Western cultures.

### National Goods Sector Awards by the Ministry of Economic Affairs

In December of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), Mr. Yao Junzhi, the initiator and current general manager of the company, made full efforts to plan. By March of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), the first factory was completed. It officially opened on April 1st. On January 10th of the same year, accountant Shen Xuejun was entrusted to legally submit a report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government for record. On February 6th and February 24th, trademarks such as Wei Dawang, Jiu Wei Yi, Xian Fu Wang, and Standard Brand were submitted to the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for registration. Subsequently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued the approval "All submitted documents are approved for record" and the Trademark Bureau issued approval for registration and exclusive use and issued Trademark Examination Certificates No. "27917", "28001", and "28002". Later, in order to encourage the export of national goods, the government prepared procedures again and entrusted accountant Shen to apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs on May 20th of this year to exempt taxes and issue national goods certificates in accordance with the current regulations on mechanized Western-style goods tax and joined the Shanghai National Goods Seasoning Products Manufacturing Industry Association's Mechanized National Goods Factory Federation as a member. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that it was a national goods new type of monosodium glutamate and approved the issuance of certificate No. 5163. The key points are hereby published for public viewing.

### The Three Standards of Standard

‚Äì Pan Yangyao

(1) Innovative Standard for Manufacturing Technology

There are no fewer than 20 monosodium glutamate factories in Shanghai, large and small, and the equipment of the Standard Factory is particularly new. Based on what I have seen, I will try to give two examples of the most advanced innovative standards for manufacturing technology designed and created by the factory itself:

A. Hydrolysis Time Shortened by More Than Half: In the production process of monosodium glutamate, the ordinary hydrolysis time under normal pressure is 36 hours, and some even take 60 hours due to simple equipment. However, the latest invention of the Standard Factory is that the hydrolysis time under normal pressure is only 20 hours, and the pressurized time is only 10 hours. After experts visited and confirmed that it has indeed created the latest standard in monosodium glutamate manufacturing technology.

B. Success in Odor-Free Evaporation Equipment: Ordinary evaporation equipment has the disadvantage of odor overflowing, causing the surrounding residents to feel disgusted. The odor-free device of the Standard Factory uses the principle of vacuum to condense all the odor and recover part of the acetic acid. Therefore, even if people stand in front of the stove, they do not smell the odor. This new invention has been praised by the Shanghai Public Concession Health Bureau and the Industrial Section as the latest equipment standard that a monosodium glutamate factory should have.

(2) Innovative Standard for Work Efficiency

The efficiency of ordinary factories is very low due to the abandonment of work and the lax management. However, from Mr. Yao Junzhi, the general manager of the Standard Factory, to the workers, they all abide by the four words of the Standard Factory's motto: Honesty, Diligence, Perseverance, and Endurance. Moreover, due to the latest scientific management, the work efficiency achieved is very amazing. Since the opening of the business, the ratio of the quantity of powder produced in three months to the number of workers has exceeded the effect of more than three times that of ordinary factories. Looking at the spirit of the whole factory, it is indeed suitable for its innovative standard of efficiency.

(3) Innovative Standard for Product Quality

Because of the above two innovative standards, the quantity of products from the Standard Factory is amazing. As for the enthusiastic welcome and best-selling situation at home and abroad, it is because the quality of its products, "Nine Flavors One" and "Fresh King", is superior. Whether it is an expert or a layman, anyone who studies its ingredients knows that its quality is indeed purer than other domestic seasonings. Therefore, the phrase "Complete Protein, Fresh Taste, Nourishing Stomach" commonly used by the Standard Factory has become a new standard for the quality of monosodium glutamate. The above three points are just a brief description of what I have seen. Fortunately, the factory welcomes academic groups to visit and discuss matters. All sectors may wish to write to contact the factory for a decision and a more detailed personal reference.

### Chinese People Don't Believe It, Foreigners Find It Strange

After Jiu Wei Yi and Xian Da Wang were launched on the market, because of their fine quality and elegant packaging, the Chinese people did not believe that there could be such excellent products among domestic goods. Foreigners also found it strange that Chinese goods could be so advanced.

But the fact is indeed the fact. With Chinese capital, Chinese management, Chinese technology, and the use of domestic raw materials as much as possible, the Standard Factory, which worked hard from top to bottom, has finally succeeded in producing the Standard Monosodium Glutamate Jiu Wei Yi and Da Wang. It is one of the jobs of goods labeling.

### Standardization Issues of National Seasoning Powder

‚Äì Zhou Dingyi, Doctor of Chemistry

The history of seasoning powder in our country is only more than ten years. There are only more than ten factories that manufacture it. In recent years, the number of new factories established has doubled. This is indeed a blessing for the industry. However, it contains a major problem, that is, how to standardize seasoning products to increase the reputation of national goods overseas. For more than a year, I have presided over the chemistry department of the Central and Shanghai Municipal Health Laboratories. I have also drafted many regulations on food and drink, and I have first published temporary test methods for sodium glutamate. I was about to start organizing the monosodium glutamate on the market because the outbreak of the war interrupted my work. It is a pity that I have not been able to complete it. Now, I have witnessed the numerous varieties and complex categories of seasonings on the market, and I feel that it is absolutely necessary to take care of them. The most common prohibited examples in the food and drink laws of various countries in the world are adulterants, especially in the laws of various states in the United States. Therefore, any food or drink that contains adulterants is subject to prohibition. For example, sodium salts of organic matter contained in sodium glutamate should be listed as adulterants. In short, the standard of seasoning powder, we must first have a definition of seasoning powder, that is, "Seasoning powder is a product rich in d-sodium glutamate, which may contain a small amount of sodium chloride (food identification)." This is a more reasonable definition. According to this, the following types of standard components should be included:

Grade A Seasoning Powder Standard

Sodium glutamate content shall not be less than 85%.

Salt content shall not be more than 15%.

In fact, in view of the fact that general customers prefer to use more irritating monosodium glutamate, there should be Grade B standards as well:

Grade B Seasoning Powder Standard

Sodium glutamate content shall not be less than 70%.

Salt content shall not be more than 20%.

If other mixtures are mixed according to the above-mentioned Grade A and B components (because the crystal water content accounts for one molecular weight of sodium glutamate), it is impossible. However, the actual sodium glutamate content of monosodium glutamate on the market is as low as 16%, and in addition to salt, it is almost 60%. This kind of suicidal policy is enough to destroy its existing market. Therefore, manufacturers bear great responsibility for the degradation of quality and urgently need to make plans. The fact of "standardizing seasoning powder" is dedicated to the market, and the future of seasoning powder will be fortunate, and the future of national goods will be fortunate. The motivation for the establishment of Standard Monosodium Glutamate Factory lies in this. The goal of all designs is to produce a monosodium glutamate that meets the above-mentioned Grade A standard under the conditions of national technology, national financial resources, national machinery, and national raw materials to supply the society. In this market filled with mixed monosodium glutamate, we are promoting the natural elimination principle of the superior winning over the inferior, winning the love and love of customers, and the permanent trust of those who love national goods.

### Half a Cent, a Bowl of Chicken Broth

Put half a square of Jiu Wei Yi Monosodium Glutamate in a bowl of white open soup, add a little high-quality soy sauce, and it becomes a very fresh and nutritious net chicken broth. But it costs only half a cent to calculate half a square of Jiu Wei Yi. Please try it, thrifty housewives, and you will know.

### Idle Talk About Freshness

When talking about freshness, people in the food industry all recommend beef, mutton, pork, duck, fish, shrimp, and the other nine kinds as the freshest. Who knows that a kind of Jiu Wei Yi can be better than these nine kinds of freshness, and it is absolutely pure, refreshing, and hygienic. It can protect the stomach. If you add a little Jiu Wei Yi when cooking these fresh dishes, the freshness will be added to the freshness. If you add a little Jiu Wei Yi when cooking vegetarian dishes, the cleanness will be added to the freshness. The freshness of the taste is nothing more than this.

### Shanghai National Goods Seasoning Products

### Please Eat Jiu Wei Yi Zhi Cai (Nine Flavors in One Dish)

A type of nine flavors in one, surpassing the nine types of beef, lamb, pork, chicken, duck, fish, shrimp, and crab, yet entirely vegetarian.

Therefore, Jiu Wei Yi Cai is not only for eating, but also suitable for friends; hygienic in hot weather and deemed suitable by friends.

Having Jiu Wei Yi‚Äîplain water, chicken broth.

### Refugee Relief Association Holds General Membership Meeting Yesterday; Passes Revenue and Expenditure Report; Ratifies Revised Board of Directors; Establishes Three New Committees for Education, Hygiene, and Fundraising; Resolves that Fundraising Efforts Should Continue

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held its first general membership meeting yesterday at 4:30 PM at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association. Representatives from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the relief committees of the Chinese Taxpayers' Associations of the two concessions, the Federation of Citizens of the First Special District, various trade guilds, various Shanghai fellow-provincial associations, various charitable organizations, and fundraising committees from the association's citizen, fellow-provincial, education, amateur performer, and dance hall groups, totaling over a thousand people, attended. Among the Chinese and Western directors and committee members of the association present were Michael, Keswick, Xu Jikang, Mao Lizhi, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and committee member Huang Yuzhai. The meeting was chaired by Director Yu Qiaqing, with secretaries Ren Jinpin, Yan E‚Äôsheng, Liu Shifang, Li Kangcheng, and Hui Keyuan. Master of ceremonies Shao Xubai. The Director delivered the opening speech, and Secretary-General Yuan Ludeng reported on the association's affairs in various districts and groups. Treasurer Xi Yushu reported on the collection and expenditure of donations. When he reported on the Central Relief Committee's allocation of 105,000 yuan, the representatives present were deeply moved by the Central Committee's kindness. It was resolved that Jiang Yiping, on behalf of the board of directors, would submit various proposals to the general meeting for discussion. Subsequently, a motion was made to express gratitude to the Director and the directors on behalf of the general meeting.

Speech by the Director: Director Yu Qiaqing said in his opening speech, "Today, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association is holding a general meeting. I am deeply grateful and honored by the presence of representatives from various groups and leaders from all walks of life. On behalf of the association and all the refugees in Shanghai, I extend my deepest gratitude. The association has been established for nine months. Although these nine months have been in an extremely difficult environment, the association's affairs have always been able to progress gradually. This cannot be attributed to the enthusiasm of international dignitaries, leaders from all walks of life, and all people in Shanghai for the general mobilization of refugees. As the ancient saying goes, 'When it comes to doing good, who is not as good as me?' In fact, judging from the experience of running the association, it can be said that 'When it comes to doing good, everyone is better than me.' I imagine that so many refugees need to be supported for such a long time. If everyone did not have a good heart and the act of doing good, relying on a few people would definitely not be sustainable. The character 'association' is composed of a heart character and three force characters. I think using this character to represent the spirit of the relief association is the truest and most accurate. Why? These three force characters are manpower, financial resources, and material resources. First is manpower. Since the establishment of the association, how many people have exerted their strength, running around and taking care of things, braving the cold and heat, not only without pay but also paying for their own transportation. This kind of effort is truly admirable. People say that the senior staff of the association are all serving voluntarily, which is admirable. In fact, comparing the voluntary service of the association's staff with the efforts of people from all walks of life, we are much more ashamed. Second is financial resources. Needless to say, from providing sustenance to education, post-disaster care, medicine, and hygiene, nothing can be done without money. Since the establishment of the association, the donations received, from all walks of life to the hardworking compatriots, they have used various methods, such as adding a surcharge to their business, deducting from their salaries, providing disaster relief from the savings, using savings from ceremonial occasions or banquets, broadcasting appeals, or performing dramas to raise funds. The most notable achievements are the Citizen Group's organization of refugee adoption and the Education Group's promotion of the Happy to Do Good badge campaign, and the fundraising for the refugee production education fund. This is enough to show the generous support of people from all walks of life, fearing that they will be left behind, so that the association can not only maintain the refugees' sustenance but also further plan for their post-disaster care, imparting skills. How precious and admirable this is. Third is material resources. Donating clothes in the winter, donating medicine in the summer, buying rice and trading coal, which is especially cheap, saving the association one point of economy means increasing one point of welfare for the refugees. This is also very touching. But these three kinds of force still have to rely on one heart to connect them. What is this heart? It is a good heart, that is, a loving heart. The three kinds of forces are valuable and sustainable only when they are driven by this good and loving heart. Which of you gentlemen who are attending today is not here driven by a good and loving heart? Everyone has this same warm, pure, and sincere heart, so naturally, we can understand each other and there are many things that we can understand without saying. As the Western saying goes, 'From war comes human affection.' This saying is really good. Shanghai has also held many relief efforts for droughts and floods in the past, but there has never been such a large scale, such a long time, such good results, and such an organization that can cooperate with both Chinese and foreigners. It is precisely because this relief is generated in the midst of war. War has given everyone a deep impression, so it also has a deep sense of sympathy. This sense of sympathy will also develop into new light and become a new torch. Please ask Secretary-General Yuan Ludeng and Treasurer Xi Yushu to report on everything that has happened. I am convinced that everyone will accept this report and will continue to help the association and guide the association so that it can complete its final mission."

Discussion of Proposals

(1) Proposal to pass the revenue and expenditure report, resolved and passed. (2) Proposal submitted by the Board of Directors for ratification: A. Director Brant has returned to his country and applied to resign. On May 24 of this year, the association, in accordance with Article 4, Section 2 of the association's constitution, "When there is a vacancy in the board of directors, it may be nominated by the board of directors," nominated Mao Lishi as a director. This should be ratified by the general meeting. B. The association's constitution originally stipulated that there should be four committees: finance, administration, post-disaster care, and supervision. Later, due to the large number of refugees and the huge amount of money needed, the fundraising plan of the Finance Committee was separately handled by the Fundraising Committee. In addition, due to the educational campaign raising more than 100,000 yuan, the education item of the Administrative Committee was separately handled by the Education Committee. The work training of the Post-Disaster Care Committee was also assigned to the Education Committee. At the same time, the duties of the Post-Disaster Care Committee were increased by adding a production education item. Furthermore, because medicine is related to people's lives, it should be given more importance than any other matter, so the medicine item of the Administrative Committee was changed to the Medical Affairs (i.e., Hygiene) Committee, which was also made independent. This should also be requested to be ratified by the general meeting. Both of the above two proposals were resolved and ratified. (3) The Fundraising Committee suggested how to continue fundraising to maintain the refugees' sustenance. The Fundraising Director, Fang Jiaobo, explained the proposal, saying, "The association has been established for more than half a year. Thanks to the mutual assistance of all sectors and the responsibility for disaster relief, everyone has generously donated and enthusiastically transported, so that the refugees' sustenance has not been interrupted. I am very grateful. However, the subscription period for each group is fixed for one year or half a year. The fundraising times vary, and the subscriptions have now expired. The association has asked them to continue fundraising, and all of them have agreed. Therefore, the sustenance is not a problem for the time being. However, the future is still long, and the difficulty can be helped. The post-disaster care of refugees must wait for time. If limited donations are used for long-term assistance, it can be inferred that it will be difficult to achieve success. If long-term strategies are not properly planned and fundraising is not continued, then the future is long and there is a hidden worry. How should we determine the method of continued fundraising? I dare to submit it to the general meeting and respectfully ask everyone to express their great opinions and jointly discuss the post-disaster care. This is what I should do, and please make a public decision." Zhang Deqin, Zhou Bangjun, and Ma Shaoquan seconded the proposal and made supplementary comments. The general meeting unanimously resolved to continue fundraising in accordance with the original subscription methods. (4) Huang Yuqi, the representative of the silver industry, temporarily proposed that the director, directors, secretary-general, and leaders of various departments and groups of the association provide voluntary service to the refugees. The general meeting should express its gratitude. Cao Zhigong, Zhu Qizhen, and others seconded the proposal, and it was unanimously passed. (5) Feng Meixue temporarily proposed that the association should supervise and improve the management of the shelters. Director Jiang Yiping explained, and Jiang Xinzhao, Yu Jingyu, and others made supplementary comments. It was resolved that the proposal should be handed over to the Board of Directors to be forwarded to the Supervisory Office for handling. The other suggestions from the Haimen Fellow-Provincial Association on sheltering beggars on the streets and from Ying Yongyu were all resolved to be handed over to the Board of Directors.

### New Regulations Reissued for Banning Transportation of Goods Aiding Japan; Bamboo, Wood, Paper, Eggs, etc., Allowed to Be Exempted from Transportation Ban to Shanghai; Tea and Tung Oil Should Continue to Be Handled with Foreign Exchange Settlement

After the Ministry of Economic Affairs promulgated the regulations on banning the transportation of goods aiding Japan, regulations on the transportation to Shanghai have been stipulated and are now ordered to be followed by all provinces and cities, and the Ministry of Finance has ordered the customs in various places to implement them. Here is the announcement from the Zhejiang Customs Superintendent and Commissioner of Customs: "It has been found that the list of goods designated to be prohibited from being transported to aid Japan, the list of areas where goods are prohibited from being transported to aid Japan, and the regulations on emergency relief for transporting prohibited goods to Shanghai have been promulgated successively by this customs in Announcements No. 99, No. 100, and No. 106, respectively. Now, the Ministry of Finance has ordered that various regulations be stipulated as follows:

Bamboo and Wood Transportation Ban

(1) All bamboo and wood (except those that can be used for construction), paper (except newsprint), charcoal, eggs, and tea that have been reviewed by the Trade Commission and are not suitable for export shall be exempt from the transportation ban to Shanghai. (2) The previously stipulated regulations on emergency relief for transporting prohibited goods to Shanghai shall be abolished. All domestic goods that are still under the transportation ban, except for white pig bristles, which can be transported by the Trade Commission, can be transported to the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession by manufacturers in our country or friendly countries in accordance with the following two methods, A and B:

Transportation to Shanghai Method

A. Before shipment, the chamber of commerce or trade association of the place of shipment and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce or the consuls of friendly countries in Shanghai shall issue certificates proving the purpose of the goods being transported to Shanghai and the name and address of the manufacturer in our country or the friendly country, and shall earnestly guarantee that the goods will not be used to aid Japan after being transported to Shanghai.

### Rice Shops in the French Concession Comply with Price Limits by Posting Prices; Rice Stored in Warehouses Is All Bai Geng; Hoarders Are Reluctant to Sell

The Shanghai Rice Shop Trade Association issued an emergency notice stating: "Recently, rice prices have soared, and market transactions are chaotic. The lowest-grade Bai Geng cannot be purchased anywhere at the price limit of 20 yuan per picul. High-quality rice samples have disappeared from the market, resulting in off-market transactions exceeding the price limits. Such behavior, whether selling, buying, or acting as an intermediary, is illegal. Therefore, we earnestly advise our fellow rice shop owners to strictly comply with the price limits set by the concession authorities. The price of high-quality Bai Geng should not exceed 20 yuan in national currency per picul, and the price of Ke Xian should not exceed 16 yuan per picul. If high-quality rice is needed on the market, you should temporarily endure it during this chaotic market situation and never purchase it at prices exceeding the limit. If there are off-market transactions exceeding the limit, settle the accounts according to the price limit and report the situation to the association so that it can be reported to the authorities for thorough investigation. I hope that all my fellow rice shop owners will not indulge in favoritism and self-interest. I hope that you will strictly abide by this. Furthermore, the association has recently received a notice from the French Municipal Council stating that rice shops in the French Concession must write the rice prices clearly according to the price limits and display them in front of the door every day starting from today. I hope you will comply with this."

Rice Stored in Warehouses Is All Bai Geng

In recent days, the concession authorities have strictly enforced price limits. Rice merchants, hoarders, and speculators have avoided the real situation and used the market as a place for off-market transactions. Outside the market, they have engaged in private transactions. Since Monday, they have not displayed samples of the highest-grade Bai Geng and ordinary Bai Geng, resulting in the disappearance of Bai Geng in the market. However, in reality, more than 200,000 bags of goods are stored in various warehouses, most of which are Bai Geng. The authorities, aware of this, are investigating the names of the owners, persuading them to sell, and not hoarding or manipulating the market, which affects people's food.

Hoarders of Stored Rice Have Been Identified

The rice stored in Shanghai is stored in various bank warehouses, private warehouses, and cargo warehouses. In order to prevent hoarding, speculation, and manipulation, the concession authorities have sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the names of the owners of the goods in various warehouses in order to verify and handle the situation. It has been learned that the rice stored in a certain bank warehouse is hoarded by non-industry people, attempting to speculate and make profits. The authorities have ordered the owner to sell all of the rice at or below the price limit. At the same time, they hope that citizens will report cases of rice shops exceeding the price limit to the police at any time. If the investigation proves to be true, they will be investigated and dealt with, and all transactions exceeding the price limit will be deemed invalid.

People's Food Supply Is Absolutely Not Worried About Shortage

The food supply for the people of Shanghai is absolutely not worried about shortage. There are six reasons for this: (1) The total amount of goods stored in various warehouses in the city is hundreds of thousands of bags, which is more than enough to supply the city. (2) The ban on rice exports from Wuhu will be lifted on August 1 after being cleared. (3) Rice industry groups and concession authorities are actively clearing the sources of supply from various places. (4) On average, more than 3,000 bags of goods arrive every day. (5) Dongxin Geng will be available on the market in ten days. (6) Other new rice will also be available on the market.

Authorities' Measures for Handling Stored Rice

The Public Concession Bureau and the French Municipal Council, in order to prevent hoarders from speculating and manipulating the market and affecting the food supply for the entire city, have jointly notified various banks, money shops, warehouses, and private temporary warehouses to report the quantity of stored rice and the names of the owners in detail within a time limit. According to a report from the Daguan News Agency, the authorities' action is to completely and thoroughly investigate whether this stored rice is in the hands of rice merchants or non-industry people, and why they are hoarding it and not selling it. The first step is to persuade the hoarders to sell it immediately in order to maintain the market. If the persuasion method fails to achieve results, then it is known that they are intentionally hoarding and manipulating the market. The second step will be to adopt appropriate measures and implement them in a mandatory manner to ensure that market transactions and supply and demand correspond to each other, and that market prices are balanced.

Common People Hope for Implementation of Government Rice Sales

The reason for the abnormal price increase in the Shanghai rice market is that if there is no manipulation and hoarding of prices by speculators and hoarders, the price will not continue to rise. Therefore, the general public has doubled their burden on the daily necessities of life, and the poor citizens feel it deeply. They are pleased with the wise concession authorities' stance on maintaining the food supply for the people. They hope that the authorities will order the hoarders to quickly plan for government rice sales to benefit the common people and reduce their burden.

Market Transactions Stalled Yesterday Morning

The Fuzhou Road Rice Industry Market of the Bean and Rice Industry Association opened at 9:00 yesterday morning. Because the hoarders still took a wait-and-see attitude, no samples of rice from the upper and middle grades were brought into the market. Except for a few Xian rice that was slightly available, there were no other rice for sale. Therefore, although the market formally opened, it was actually in a state of stagnation. The reason for this is that speculators are still manipulating the market. I hope the authorities will pay attention to it in order to maintain normal market transactions.

Selling Privately at Prices Exceeding the Limit, Refusing to Issue Invoices

The authorities of the two concessions have strictly enforced price limits in order to maintain the food supply for the people. For example, Jiu Da Rice Shop was penalized by having its business license revoked for exceeding the price limit. Many other rice shops that exceeded the limit have also received the same penalty. Therefore, people's minds have turned stable. Currently, some rice shops, in order to avoid punishment, refuse to issue invoices for rice that exceeds the price limit. I hope that citizens will report them to the police at any time to assist the authorities in maintaining rice prices.

### Strike Wave on Japanese Public Buses in Hongkou

The English-language "Great America Evening News" reported that half of the 260 Chinese drivers and conductors of the Japanese public bus company in Hongkou suddenly refused to work for the company yesterday (the 27th). Although the company immediately tried its best to recruit Japanese drivers and conductors, the public bus traffic in Hongkou could only maintain three-fifths of its normal level. According to the Japanese public bus company, Chinese guerrillas appeared in Hongkou via the Public Concession and the French Concession and threatened its Chinese employees. It also said that the company's labor conditions were not bad, providing free accommodation, with drivers receiving a monthly salary of 50 yuan and female conductors receiving 25 yuan.

### Letter from Regiment Commander of the Lone Army to the Municipal Council Requesting Restoration of Freedom; Detained Here for Twenty-One Months; Please Consider Restoring Freedom

Xie Jinyuan, Regiment Commander of the Lone Army, sent a letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday stating, "It has been twenty-one months since we have been detained here. I truly do not know why this third party's request and the high authorities' order to withdraw were both out of consideration for the safety of the concession. Now, China and Japan are at war without a declaration of war. No one can predict when the war will end. Therefore, I dare to ask your Bureau to deeply consider the issue of restoring our freedom. This is not only the fortune of public justice and international treaties, but also the fortune of human civilization. To the Public Concession Municipal Council."

### Confiscated Garbage Trucks Returned to the Municipal Council; No Conditions Attached When Returning the Vehicles; Now Requesting Monthly Payment of 15,000 Yuan

The "China Mail" reports that the hundred or so foreign and Chinese workers of the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council who were detained by the "Great Way" authorities on Sunday afternoon were released on Wednesday noon. At the same time, the thirty-one trucks of the Public Works Department that were confiscated were also returned to the Municipal Council authorities shortly after 4:00 PM yesterday (the 27th). As far as can be confirmed, no conditions were attached to the return of the vehicles. A Japanese naval spokesman stated at a press conference yesterday, "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan misunderstood the agreement between the Japanese Marines and the Municipal Council regarding dumping garbage in the designated area near Baziqiao. Both parties faithfully abide by the terms of the agreement, which "Mayor" Chuan apparently did not know. The spokesman replied to a question that, in his opinion, the issue of the Municipal Council paying a monthly fee did not arise. Because the Municipal Council did not protest to the Japanese Marines, the release of people and vehicles was delayed for a long time. When all three parties knew the truth of the situation, the matter was resolved and is now over. Before yesterday evening, the reporter visited Mr. Chuan to verify.

Trucks Returned

The reporter asked if the "Great Way" municipal government would require the Municipal Council to pay a fee. Mr. Fu confirmed that he had asked the Municipal Council to pay 15,000 yuan per month, instead of the 10,000 yuan paid to the Shanghai municipal government before the war. When asked why the fee was higher than before, he said that there were more people currently living in the Public Concession, so there was more garbage. According to Public Works Department personnel, the incident of being detained by the "Great Way" police while attempting to dump garbage in the area designated by the Japanese Marines was sudden. It has been more than four weeks since the Municipal Council and the "Great Way" authorities discussed the garbage dumping matter. It was learned yesterday that the talks will continue.

### After the U.S.-Japan Trade Treaty Is Abolished, Foreign Exchange Loosens

Gold Prices Fall, Securities Rise, Discount Drops

Since the United States announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Trade Treaty, the Shanghai financial market has improved, the black market for foreign exchange has loosened, the black market for securities has risen, and the black market for gold prices has fallen. According to a report from the New Voice News Agency yesterday after inquiring about the financial market: (1) In the black market for foreign exchange, although the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation quoted 4 pence for British exchange and 7.75 yuan for U.S. exchange, the actual market price was 4.375 pence for British exchange and 8.375 yuan for U.S. exchange, which was slightly looser compared to the previous day. (2) In the black market for gold, prices fell after opening yesterday morning. The closing price in the morning was 3,800 yuan, and the closing price in the afternoon was 3,695 yuan. The public price quoted by major silver shops has dropped from 390 yuan to 375 yuan. (3) The black market for securities rose yesterday. The closing price in the morning was 53.6 yuan for Unified Government Bonds Type A, up 1.6 yuan; 44.3 yuan for Type B, up 9 cents; 42.6 yuan for Type C, up 8 cents; 41.9 yuan for Type D, up 9 cents; and 42.25 yuan for Type E, up 9 cents. (4) The remittance discount was 250 yuan yesterday, which was lower than the previous day.

### Japan Notifies the U.S., Germany, and Italy to Carefully Use Flags

Claiming that Residents of the Zhoushan Islands Are Abusing the Flags of These Three Countries

The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, at the request of the Japanese Navy, sent texts to the consulates of the U.S., Germany, and Italy in Shanghai on the 26th, requesting that the flags of the three countries be used carefully in the Zhoushan Islands. The content of the text actually claimed that Chinese residents on the Zhoushan Islands were abusing the flags of the three countries for protection.

### Fortifications Built on Avenue Edward VII

French Concession Consolidates Defenses; Parking Prohibited in Chang Geng Lane

In order to maintain the safety and security of residents in the concession, the French Concession authorities, in addition to stepping up the number of patrols in the concession and searching entrants, are building two concrete fortifications at the west end of the Great World on Avenue Edward VII. Construction of the fortifications began yesterday and is expected to be completed today. At the same time, in the Public Concession, signs have been erected on Avenue Edward VII from the entrance of Chang Geng Lane east of Jiangxi Road to the intersection of Jiangxi Road, with a special notice stating, "Parking is prohibited here," in order to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents as the Chang Geng Lane attack a few days ago. The "China Mail" reported that most of the bungalows on Zhoujiazui Island belong to nationals of third countries. When the war broke out in Shanghai a few years ago, some of these bungalows were destroyed or completely destroyed, and they were also looted. The Japanese military authorities controlling the island have recently discussed the issue with the third-country nationals who own the bungalows through the Japanese consulate and are willing to compensate them. The exact amount of compensation is unknown. The Zhoujiazui Island Residents Association has been working for many months to enable its members to obtain compensation. The Japanese military authorities have their own appraisers to assess the value of these bungalows in order to determine the amount of compensation. Although the compensation is much lower than the actual value of the houses, it is heard that some foreigners have accepted this solution, but other bungalow owners have refused the compensation offered by the Japanese authorities on the grounds that their houses are worth more than the compensation. It is also heard that the Japanese authorities have so far refused to consider compensation for the items in the bungalows, such as refrigerators and radios, many of which were stolen during the war. The value of these items is often higher than the value of the bungalows. It is understood that this is the first time the Japanese authorities have decided to compensate for the damage caused by the war in the suburbs of Shanghai.

### Suspicious Youth Arrested - Confiscated a Box of Pistols - Claimed to have Obtained from the Da Feng Heng Customs Brokerage - All Involved Individuals Simultaneously Arrested

Around 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a young man in a Western suit was seen at the Thames Building on Avenue Edward VII, ascending in the elevator. He held a paper package under his arm and carried a suitcase in his hand. The stationed detective found him suspicious and subjected him to a search. Upon opening the paper package, it was found to contain a pistol. Following this lead, the detectives opened the suitcase and discovered six more pistols and over two hundred bullets inside. The youth was immediately detained and questioned about his origin. He claimed to be from the Da Feng Heng Customs Brokerage in Room 319 of the building. The detectives immediately searched Room 319 and took all the occupants into custody for investigation. According to a reporter's subsequent investigation, the company had leased the premises six months ago, and its daily business was unclear, but card playing could be heard day and night without interruption.

### Foreign Shipping Rates - Settled in Hong Kong Dollars

Shipping fees paid in legal tender, to be settled within three days of customs clearance.

Starting June 22nd, the British companies Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson revised their freight rates, recalculating the price list in Hong Kong dollars. Customs brokerages pay freight charges in national currency, with the two companies settling the exchange rate of national currency to Hong Kong dollars every two weeks. Other companies have followed suit (freight charges are still calculated in national currency). Recently, there has been a sudden and drastic shrinking and soaring of Hong Kong dollar exchange rates. To mitigate losses, Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson have now decided to revise the method of settling freight charges in national currency based on Hong Kong dollar exchange rates, effective from the 30th of this month. The announcement from the two companies is recorded below: "Important Notice: Effective July 30th, the payment of freight charges will be implemented according to the following methods: (1) Cargo and passengers may pay freight charges in Hong Kong dollars according to the price list. (2) Cargo and passengers may also pay freight charges in Chinese national currency based on the Hong Kong dollar amount listed in the price list, calculated using the exchange rate announced by our company on the customs clearance date of each shipment. This freight charge must be paid within three days after the customs clearance date of each shipment; otherwise, the exchange rate on the payment date will be used for calculation. (3) Freight deposits may be paid by cargo and passengers in Hong Kong dollars or Chinese national currency, according to the following methods: A. If the deposit is paid in Hong Kong dollars, the freight charge will be calculated according to the price list. After the amount is verified, any surplus or deficiency will be refunded or collected in Hong Kong dollars. B. If the deposit is paid in national currency, the amount will still be calculated in Hong Kong dollars. The deposit collected will be converted into Hong Kong dollars using the exchange rate announced by our company on the shipping date of the goods, and stored. After the amount is verified, any surplus or deficiency will be refunded or collected in Chinese national currency based on the original exchange rate."

### Major Clash Among Puppet Troops in Xinchang

Over a Hundred Puppet Soldiers Dead, Over Thirty Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded

On the night before last (the 27th), around 8:00 PM, a major clash occurred among the troops of Zhang Miaogen, a puppet "army" stationed in Xinchang Town, District 7 of Nanhui, Pudong, due to conflicting interests. The leader of the faction clashing with Zhang's men is still unknown. However, the fierce battle continued until dawn before ceasing, resulting in heavy casualties, with each side suffering sixty to seventy dead or wounded, totaling over a hundred. Afterwards, both sides withdrew from Xinchang and took refuge in the countryside. At noon, during the night's fierce battle, the Japanese army's Ogawa unit in Zhoupu received the report and dispatched over a hundred infantrymen, aided by twenty to thirty military police, to Xinchang to suppress the situation. However, in the darkness, they were unable to distinguish friend from foe. The puppet "army" became suspicious of each other and also fired upon the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers then joined in, indiscriminately opening fire, resulting in a chaotic battle. After dawn, the Japanese side counted their casualties, finding over thirty dead or wounded. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a severely wounded man, resembling a junior officer, due to the inadequate medical facilities in Zhoupu, took the Shanghai-Nanhui train to Zhoujiadu, transferred to the South Pier, and boarded a ferry to Nanshi, ultimately heading to the Zhongshan Hospital in western Shanghai for treatment. Although the cause of the puppet troops' conflict is likely due to financial issues, with Zhang Miaogen not yet returning to Nanhui County, the Japanese side fears that the warring puppet "army" may mutiny again. Security is extremely tight, and both land and water transportation are temporarily blockaded.

### Yongyuan Gambling Den Owner Shot Dead Yesterday - Died Instantly from Two Gunshot Wounds

Zhang Amao (also known as Kang Mei), a native of Chuansha, 31 years old, was the owner of the Yongyuan gambling den at No. 6 Le'an Lane, corner of Route des Soeurs in western Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, around 8:40 PM, Zhang Amao exited the gambling den and walked south. As he passed the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Dibafa Road, a car with license number 10468 suddenly approached and followed Zhang. Six or seven men were seated inside the car. As the car drew near Zhang, the men pulled out pistols and fired three shots at Zhang. Zhang Amao, caught off guard, was hit by two bullets on the spot and collapsed to the ground. By the time nearby patrolmen arrived after hearing the shots, the car had already sped away. Upon checking Zhang's injuries, it was found that he had been shot once in the head and once in the mouth, with several front teeth dislodged by the bullets. Blood covered the ground. They immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate and pursue the assailants. Meanwhile, Zhang Amao was sent to the Bailong Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died on the way. The body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination. As of the time of writing, the car used by the perpetrators has not yet been found.

### Remittance Drafts Drawn by Money Shops Exceed Expectations

Reaching Over Twelve Million - To be Submitted to the General Assembly for Report

The total amount of 10 million yuan in chits for new remittance drafts to be drawn by various money shops has been reported by all shops within the deadline. The five or six money shops that had not yet reported submitted their reporting procedures to the association for review yesterday morning. A leading figure in the money industry told a reporter from Da Guang News yesterday that the preparation of funds by various remittance draft money shops has always been very solid. After the war, the current assets and circulating funds of each shop are still progressing towards prosperity. The drawing of remittance draft chits this time is purely to restrict withdrawals, prevent the escape of funds, strengthen the credit of legal tender, and curb unscrupulous individuals from profiting from foreign exchange speculation. This is a sign of improvement in China's finances and is by no means due to insufficient reserves of banks and money shops, requiring the drawing of this large amount of chits. As for the estimated amount of drafts required by each shop reported to the association, the total has already reached over 12 million, indeed exceeding the previously assumed amount of 10 million yuan. Moreover, there are still several money shops reporting that they do not need this kind of chit. If every shop were to need to draw them, even 20 million yuan of chits would be insufficient to allocate. All the remittance drafts drawn by each shop are merely a hypothetical number. Whether or not they can meet the amount to be drawn in future business is difficult to predict beforehand. It is estimated that after the reports from each shop are completed, the association plans to submit the matter to the executive committee or the members' general assembly for report.

### Charity Lottery Tickets - Issued Today

Drawing on September 4th

The Charity Lottery Tickets for Refugee Relief have been issued for eleven periods since their inception. Due to the widespread prizes and excellent reputation, they have gained deep trust from all sectors of society, so the sales volume in each period has always been over 150,000 yuan, greatly benefiting refugees. Now, because the previous sales agent, Da Gong Enterprise Company, is pursuing other businesses and has ceased sales, Father Rao Jiaju of the Lottery Ticket Committee, fearing that it would affect the lives of refugees, specially invited Mr. Xu Weizhou, a leading figure in the financial world, and philanthropist Mr. Ou Cheng, and others to organize Fengxing Company to continue sales. The report yesterday that a Mr. Ma organized and promoted guerrilla areas is not true. It is now heard that all procedures for the lottery tickets have been completed and will officially continue to be issued starting today. The drawing will still be held publicly at the Yiyuan Garden on September 4th. All banks and lottery ticket shops in this city will sell them uniformly. Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, recognizing that these lottery tickets are related to the relief of Chinese compatriots, have contacted many to promote sales in various regions of Southeast Asia.

### Another High Tide From the First of Next Month

Tides Over Ten Feet High - Prolonged Tide for Five Days

Although the tides in the Huangpu River have been tending to subside since the 22nd, according to a reporter from Da Tong News who inquired at the Harbour Bureau, there will be another high tide in the Huangpu River from the 1st to the 5th of next month. The predicted quantities are all above ten feet. As typhoons continue to invade, it is hoped that no typhoons coincide with the above-mentioned tide periods.

### Valuable Electrical Cables Stolen in Hongqiao District - Thieves Experienced and Equipped - Stolen Areas All Within Japanese Jurisdiction

The North-China Daily News reports that thieves in the Hongqiao area are apparently no longer concerned with the Shanghai Telephone Company's wires, but are stealing more valuable, yet more dangerous, high-voltage cables. These high-voltage cables are used by the Shanghai Power Company to supply electricity to residents and factories as far as Hongqiao Road. According to a member of the power company yesterday (27th), thieves are quite active and have stolen these valuable cables six times since July 11th. These individuals seem to be experienced in this field, not only possessing considerable electrical expertise but also undoubtedly having a complete set of wire-cutting tools. After an unsuccessful theft attempt on the night of July 24th, there were no further thefts. One Chinese person, while walking past a power company pole, did not notice a newly cut cable fallen to the ground, touched the cable, and died. The thieves, panicked and fleeing, did not bother to cut the other end of the cable to prevent the electric shock, leaving the Chinese person electrocuted on the road. Each stolen section has been within half a mile of the intersection of Warren Road and Lincoln Avenue, and each stolen section is no more than three or four feet long. The stolen areas are all within areas patrolled by the Japanese army, and the Shanghai Municipal Police are currently unable to operate in these areas. In order to prevent the cables from attracting the attention of thieves, the Shanghai Power Company is now replacing the stolen cables with thinner and cheaper cables, hoping to prevent further disruptions to the electricity supply, as it is believed that thieves will not be willing to risk their lives to steal less valuable cables.

### Midnight Gunshots

Pedestrian Found with Pistol - Indicted for Endangering Public Safety

Western officers from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, along with Chinese officers Nos. 490, 1533, 228, and 3104, were conducting searches and patrols in their jurisdiction at 2:15 AM yesterday morning. As they were passing the Tangdian Lane area on Route des Soeurs in western Shanghai, they suddenly heard a gunshot. They immediately began investigating and saw a man approaching. The Chinese and Western officers believed that, given the late hour and the curfew, wandering alone was suspicious. They stopped him, searched him, and found a pistol and three bullets. They arrested him and took him to the police station. During interrogation, he claimed his name was Xu Asi, from Jiangbei. He claimed that he had bought the pistol from Li Xiaosi for twenty yuan at 3:00 PM yesterday. Because he didn't know if the pistol was good, he took it to the Suzhou Creek late at night and fired a shot into the sky before being arrested. He was ordered to be detained. At around 9:00 AM, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a public prosecution under Article 187 of the Criminal Code for endangering public safety, and stated the above circumstances, saying that it was still necessary to investigate whether the words of the defendant in the police station were reliable, or if there were other circumstances, so he requested permission to postpone the hearing. Judge Xiao Peishen reviewed the confession and ordered Xu Aji to be detained pending a hearing, postponed for seven days for further investigation.

### Woman Dies by Hanging Due to Uterine Disease

The woman, Hu Junzhen, residing at No. 17 Model Village, Avenue Foch, 35 years old, from Changzhou, married to a man from Shaoxing, was sent to Room 42 of the China-Belgium Radium Hospital at No. 1729 Avenue Joffre by her family on the 24th of last month for treatment of uterine disease. After more than a month, her condition did not improve, leading her to feel hopeless. At 10:00 PM on the 27th, she hanged herself with a belt from the iron bed frame in her hospital room. By the time the nurse discovered her, she had already died and could not be saved. They reported it to the French Police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken down and transported to the coroner's office at Dalas Route for examination. The family was notified. Yesterday morning, a report was made to the Second Special Court, and the prosecutor and forensic doctor went to the office to confirm that the deceased had died by hanging. After the report investigated the situation, the body was claimed by her son, Hu Hongyuan, who signed a guarantee.

### Body of Jewish Man, Luo'er, Found

The French-language Shanghai Daily reported on the 28th that the body of Luo'er (transliteration), a Jewish refugee who committed suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River on July 24th, was found near the Qiujiang Road pier on the afternoon of July 26th. It is also reported that the body was identified by his brother-in-law and others, and jointly examined by the prosecutor and forensic doctor of the Second Special District Court, as well as representatives of the French Police.

### Elderly Man Run Over by Route 10 Bus

Around 9:00 AM yesterday morning near Qingdao Road and Wenzhou Road, a pedestrian, nearly sixty years old, was crossing the road when a Route 10 bus, No. 15042, approached and, unable to avoid it in time, was knocked to the ground and suffered a crushed skull. He immediately lost consciousness. He was rushed to Baolong Hospital by street patrolmen No. 515 in an ambulance, but he died shortly after. The deceased was wearing a silk shirt, white cotton pants, white socks, and cloth shoes. His name is unknown. The police are currently investigating.

### Two Robberies on the Road

Around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, a man was carrying over 2,160 yuan in national currency, wrapped in newspapers, when walking on Ningbo Road, Shandong Road. Suddenly, two bandits emerged from the side of the road. One bandit displayed a pistol, threatening and intimidating him.

### Finance International News Clears Up Gold Plummets

Yesterday's spot gold black market situation: Gold prices have been rising sharply in recent days, and have been rising continuously for four days, a total increase of 395 yuan. However, yesterday a sudden reaction occurred, and the decline was also very drastic, reaching a low of 3,690 yuan before the evening close. As a result, it plummeted by 170 yuan. This was largely because the US Senate passed the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty signed in 1911. In addition, it was reported that Britain would also take the same step. Therefore, the foreign exchange market in this city gradually became clear, and most of those who had long held firm intentions began to have active thoughts and thoughts. Bullish forces, such as securities firms, wealthy individuals, and gold shops, sold off one after another. Although a certain bank (on behalf of foreign firms) and Hong Kong speculators continued to add positions, the price was ultimately weak and could not rise. However, the tight foreign exchange report in the middle once triggered buying interest, which briefly reached 3,820 yuan, but ultimately closed at 3,695 yuan. Trading activity was still strong, at around 1,500 taels. The price of gold jewelry in gold shops fluctuated, ultimately falling by 15 yuan. The price of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Plummets 170 Yuan

Since the morning, the initial sentiment for each tael (ten taels) was weak. Coupled with the hard foreign exchange report, those who wanted to enter the market were even more hesitant. As a result, it was shrouded in a general selling mood, and it opened sharply lower by 145 yuan. A certain money exchange sold 20 taels to securities firms and gold shops, at a price of 3,720 yuan each. Then, it sold 10 taels to a gold shop for 3,710 yuan. Later, it was heard that foreign exchange had tightened, stimulating buying interest. Gold shops and retail investors rushed to buy at low prices, and it soon rebounded by 110 yuan. A certain gold shop (on behalf of Hong Kong speculators) bought 20 taels from a gold shop for 3,820 yuan. After that, although a certain bank (on behalf of foreign firms) aggressively bought more than 100 taels, securities firms, gold shops, and floating longs all rushed to sell first, and the market momentum weakened again, retreating by 60 yuan. A gold shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange for 3,770 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange aggressively bought more than 100 taels, and the selling pressure had decreased, rebounding by 35 yuan. A certain money exchange bought 50 taels from a peer for 3,795 yuan. After that, the bullish forces of the securities firms suddenly turned and came out of the cage. Although a certain bank (on behalf of foreign firms) and a certain gold shop continued to absorb, the number of sellers was still high, and the market price fell by 45 yuan. A money exchange sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,750 yuan. After 11:30 AM, the securities firms stopped selling and watched, and another money exchange aggressively bought more than 100 taels, raising the price by 50 yuan. Securities firms bought 10 taels from cash gold shops, and money exchanges did 50 taels of mutual business at 3,800 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, the underlying trend weakened again, and the opening was 30 yuan lower. A gold shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange for 3,770 yuan. Then, it rebounded by 10 yuan, and gold shops did 20 taels of mutual business at 3,780 yuan. At that time, due to the hard foreign exchange report and the gold shops' competition to sell, the market momentum weakened and plunged by 90 yuan, breaking into the 3,700 yuan level. Money exchanges did 50 taels of mutual business at 3,690 yuan, which was the lowest price of the day. Later, a money exchange sold 50 taels to a gold shop for 3,695 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session. As a result, it fell back by 170 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 130 yuan throughout the day. The cash gold of the local brand was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and neither was traded.

Gold Jewelry Lists 15 Yuan Lower

At the beginning, the large firms still listed the selling price of gold jewelry at 390 yuan per tael. But by 9:45 AM, due to the spot gold opening lower by more than 100 yuan, they also listed it 15 yuan lower. Five minutes later, it rebounded by 5 yuan, and at 10:00 AM, it was listed 5 yuan higher again. At 10:50 AM, it was listed 5 yuan lower, and at 11:37 AM, it rebounded by 5 yuan again. At 2:30 PM, it was listed 5 yuan lower, and at 3:15 PM, it was listed 5 yuan lower again. After that, there were no changes, and as a result, it was listed 15 yuan lower. It is estimated that the large firms changed to list 375 yuan, the new firms listed 375 yuan, and the new firms listed 373 yuan. There was still no fixed price for purchases.

### Stable Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. Since the US-Japan commercial treaty was canceled the day before yesterday, most operators in the British and American exchange black market believed that it would be quite beneficial to our country, so people's hearts gradually stabilized, causing the market momentum to reach stability and present a hovering trend. At the beginning, the market was hard because Western merchant Sassoon and the foreign telegraph company had strong selling intentions. Later, because foreign firms frequently came to pull together, it once became tight. Finally, the Indian Bank Company came to throw it again, causing the results to return slightly harder. There were many swaps for July and August in the middle of the day. At noon, American Bank Chase posted 875 American dollars, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of one cent and one and a half cents. In the afternoon, Chase posted 8125 American dollars again, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of about one cent and six mils. Finally, Chase was only willing to post 75 American dollars, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of only nine mils. Trading activity was flat throughout the day.

Sassoon and Foreign Telegraph Company Have Selling

In the early morning, as London's spot and forward large bars rebounded by 0.0625, New York silver prices remained fixed, London bullion remained unchanged, the exchange rate of British against American remained unchanged, it was flat against Shanghai by 25, and flat against France. The exchange rate of American against British fell by 0.0625, against Shanghai fell by 45 cents, and against France shrank by 0.0625. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same as before. The bank's spot selling price opened in the morning: British gold at 4 pounds 3125 shillings, and American exchange at 8 yuan 375, Luo Qianshou, British loose 125, and American hard 1875. After opening, Western merchant Sassoon and foreign telegraph companies competed to throw and sell. Moreover, foreign firms lacked funds to settle accounts, causing the market momentum to become looser. It is estimated that the foreign telegraph company and Sassoon successively sold spot British gold to HSBC and McGalli, hardening from 4 pounds 3125 shillings to 375, and also spot American exchange softened from 8 yuan 375 to half yuan. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no changes at all. And when the silver balancing tax was announced, it was still exempt. After that, foreign firms suddenly had more accounts to settle, and Western merchant Sassoon and foreign telegraph companies had stopped selling. In addition, HSBC and other foreign firms were unwilling to sell cheaply, causing the situation to suddenly turn tight and soft. It is estimated that the foreign firms pulled in spot British gold from HSBC and McGalli for only 4 pounds 25 shillings, and purchased spot American exchange from a certain bank for only 8 yuan 25. Near noon, there were some swap transactions. It is estimated that American Bank Chase sold this month and entered August, estimating that the subsidy to arbitrageurs was 875 American dollars, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of one cent and one and a half cents. By the time of the afternoon close, the bank's spot selling price was British gold at 4 pounds 28125 shillings, and American exchange at 8 yuan 3125, which was a rebound of 0.03125 British and a softening of 0.0625 American compared to the morning opening.

Swap Transactions Quite Frequent

In the later market, because the Indian Bank Company came to throw again, and the foreign firms' account settlements became clearer, the market momentum became more stable. It is estimated that the Indian Bank Company sold spot British gold at 4 pounds 3125 shillings and 375 shillings, and spot American exchange at 8 yuan 375 and half yuan to HSBC and other foreign firms. Then, speculators spat out American exchange for August at 7 yuan 625 to a certain bank. At that time, there were many arbitrageurs. It was heard that Chase sold this month and entered August again, estimating that the subsidy to wealthy merchants was 8125 American dollars, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of about one cent and six mils. After entering the market, it was heard that Chase was only willing to post 75. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was British gold at 4 pounds 3125 shillings, and American exchange at 8 yuan 375. As a result, it was a loosening of 125 British and a hardening of 1875 American compared to the previous day.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Drops 5 Yuan

Hong Kong, 28th Telegram, the exchange market opened firmly today, with no movement against British and American, the Shanghai exchange rate fell 15 yuan, and the Japanese exchange rate loosened 25. At 11:05 AM, the Shanghai exchange rate rebounded by 10 yuan to 335 yuan. The morning close and the 2:30 PM opening were unchanged. At 3:00 PM, the British exchange rate was tight 0.03125, at one shilling two pence 65625, and the forward rate was unchanged. The American exchange rate was 0.0625 each for the spot and forward rates, with the spot rate at 28 yuan 5625 and the forward rate at 28 yuan half.

### Foreign Currency

How Can They Be Used Universally?

Regarding banknotes with place names from outside the city, (except for Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan, which are not allowed to circulate in the market due to the prevention of speculation, and are only allowed to be remitted to the place of origin or the mainland, this city should use them uniformly. However, various merchants and banks refuse to accept them. After being repeatedly recorded in this newspaper, and the local news in yesterday's newspapers, regarding "banknotes with place names from outside the city, the Shanghai market generally uses them at full value, and no banks or money shops refuse to accept them.") This newspaper has again investigated from various sources and found that most merchants and money shops still refuse to accept them. When asked for their reasons, they said that they were afraid that the issuing banks in this city would not allow them to be accepted or exchanged in the future, causing losses. However, the banks concerned still refuse to publish a formal announcement in various newspapers, and only use irresponsible wording for publicity, which inevitably makes people more suspicious. If they are truly determined to facilitate the holders of the banknotes, they should immediately publish an announcement in the newspaper that they will be used uniformly and send a letter to the two associations of money shops and silver firms, stating that they will be responsible for the exchange in the future. The money shop association should send a letter to all member banks and firms to use them uniformly. In this way, the city's citizens will be willing to accept banknotes with place names from outside the city and commercial banks, and there will be no more discrimination as is currently the case.

### Foreign Currencies Begin to Fall

Yesterday's foreign currencies: Due to the impact of the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, the market atmosphere improved, and foreign exchange loosened. Spot gold fell sharply. The supply of British and American gold pounds and gold tickets has been smooth, and the market situation has loosened and declined. Hong Kong franc tickets, etc., have all returned. However, the rebound after the big rise is still weak. If the international situation develops and there is economic assistance, then foreign currencies may continue to loosen. The demand for Japanese gold tickets is scarce, and the decline is quite drastic, with the evening market at 1 yuan 1 jiao 1 fen. Korean tickets also fell sharply, with the evening market at 8 jiao 9 fen. There were few public transactions. Only Xiangfeng sold and Wankang bought 200 yuan of American gold tickets. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell 2 yuan, British gold tickets fell 1 yuan 8 jiao, American gold pounds fell 1 yuan, American gold tickets fell 9 jiao, Hong Kong tickets fell 1 jiao 6 fen, franc tickets fell 5 li, Singapore tickets fell jiao, Dutch tickets and Philippine tickets each fell 3 jiao, Canadian tickets fell 5 jiao, Australian gold tickets fell 1 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Large Bars Slightly Higher Indian Silver Recent Slight Decline

London, 27th Telegram, the silver market has some shorts covering, and the supply is low. The market is flat, and the closing is slightly harder. The Indian quote is 0.0625 higher than the listed price, and someone came to inquire, but no trading was seen later. Large silver bars, the spot and forward rates both rebounded by 0.0625. New York silver telegram, the American spot rate remained fixed as before. Also, Mumbai silver telegram, the Indian silver market was calm, the spot and August rates both shrunk by one anna, and the September rate had no rise or fall. A total of 75 transaction orders were made, etc.

### Discount Rate Returns Low by 10 Yuan

Yesterday's discount rate for bank drafts and bills was slightly lower. The morning rate for every 1,000 yuan was around 250 yuan, and in the afternoon it rose to 260 yuan again. The final rate was 255 yuan, which was 10 yuan lower than the previous day. The money industry association's call rate remained flat, opening at 2 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities US Abolishes Japan Trade Agreement Domestic Debt Excitement Foreign Stocks Depend on Foreign Exchange

The black market for securities rebounded by about one yuan yesterday. This is because the abolition of the US-Japan trade agreement, in this precarious situation, is no less than a light in a dark valley. Although the effect is still six months away, China has gained unlimited spiritual comfort. Foreign exchange is long, gold is falling, and public bonds are rising. This can also be said to be the effect of a telegram. However, the rise in public bonds is not natural, and the counter trading accounts for half of it. Therefore, its trend first rises and then falls, and cannot be established. Most market psychology believes that Category C is high at 44 yuan, and it may not be easy to break out, and low at 40 yuan, and it may not be easy to enter. In this three or four yuan high and low hovering, speculators use it, and are passively endless. Most investors are deeply rooted. In this situation, the market price fluctuations are already limited. The interest payment situation is how, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow will be revealed. Large rises and falls will be at the beginning of next week. Yesterday, Category C and E were more active, and the rest fluctuated very little. At the beginning, the 14th, 20th, and 64th were bought, raising the price by about one yuan. The opening continued to rise by two or three jiao, but still failed to reach the number of four yuan. Later, Tongkang, Hengyu, Datong, Shuntai and others continued to sell, and the market could not support it, hitting the three yuan level, to 6 yuan 6 jiao. Although Xieda and Maofeng had eating in at the close, the supply was still greater than the demand and the market was weak. As a result, it still rose by 8 jiao half to 1 yuan 6 jiao. It is heard that the issue of principal and interest has been telegraphed by the Ministry of Finance according to the original plan, but whether it is legal currency or exchange is still undecided. Probably there is no big problem, and the future should be better. The total turnover was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading, 50 shares of Dachunghua Match Company were traded, at a legal currency price of 12 yuan 1 jiao, which is an increase of 3 jiao compared to the previous day.

The Public Industry Association reported that yesterday was the last day of the week's trading, and more stocks were released on the market. Although there was this selling pressure, the general prices were still able to support it, and the rubber stocks changed slightly. The most intense declines were in the electricity six two preferred shares and the Kaiping shares. The Wheelock shares and telephone shares were slightly higher than the previous day's low price. The market atmosphere this week was particularly disappointing and tasteless. Now that foreign exchange is tight, the value of rubber stocks should increase, but due to other reasons, they have suffered a setback. It seems that there cannot be an accurate market at present, and we must wait for the foreign exchange to have a stable foothold, and for currency capital to be able to loosen for ordinary commerce and investment, instead of being used exclusively for foreign exchange speculation or changing the use of foreign exchange.

London British merchants' Far East companies' stock market prices on the 27th of this month (Thursday) were generally stable, but the Gula Ke Lin Rubber rose by seven pence half, with a price of seventeen shillings six pence.

The listing price of the China foreign debt on the 27th of this month (Thursday), the upper and lower grades of each public debt remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton Weaker Speculative Activity Decreases Yarn Market Hovers on the Horizontal Line

The yarn market first rose and then weakened, and the trend hovered on the horizontal line. This is because the false rumors of the day before were greatly calmed down. Because the United States and Japan announced the abolition of the commercial treaty, general speculators were slightly hit, and the mood of activity was not as strong as the day before. Therefore, the opening momentum was good and continued to rise. Then, it was heard that foreign exchange was long and the exchange rate was relaxed, and it weakened again. As for the actual demand, Hong Kong firms' purchases of 10-count coarse yarn are still unabated, and the market situation is still stable. However, a batch of unpopular yarns, such as 20-count Five Fortunes and Shepherd, are also relatively cheap.

The situation of spot yarn: At the beginning of the morning opening, the momentum of the previous day was carried forward, and the popularity was tight. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 4 or 5 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day, but it was still similar to the black market price in the afternoon. The price of 20-count Shuangma outside the wharf was 565 yuan, and the price of the wharf bill was 555 yuan. After a while, it was heard that gold had returned to a small level and the exchange rate was easing, and the popularity immediately weakened. Retail investors, seeing the bad atmosphere, vomited one after another. The price of 20-count Shuangma outside the wharf fell back to 559 yuan, and the price of the wharf bill was 546 yuan half. The trading activity in and out of the market recently has been greatly reduced compared with the past, probably due to the impact of tight silver roots. The closing was also stable. It is found that the semi-day transaction statistics are 808 packages, and the afternoon transactions on the previous day were 70 packages. The market situation is not very different from the previous day. The factory opened 120 packages of 20-count special Jincheng from Yongan Factory, at a price of 640 yuan. Hong Kong firms entered. The amount of each bangkou purchased is listed below:

Tonghang 485 Hong Kong 310

Mainland 13 Statistics 808

The Japanese yarn market in the north of Tianjin has some purchases, which stabilizes people's hearts, but the ups and downs in the middle are still the most active transactions in the coming month. The local business is mediocre, and the current price of 20-count Yueqin is 430 yuan, etc.

### Tianjin Fine Cotton Continues to Arrive South

The cotton market continues to show progress, but actual prices remain relatively stable. Opening prices are more than ten yuan cheaper than those of foreign firms' orders. These cotton prices were all settled when exchange rates were favorable, resulting in substantial profits for the cotton companies. Now, the cotton has been loaded and arrived in Shanghai, and it is difficult to quickly find sufficient legal tender to take delivery. Due to environmental constraints, they are willing to accept lower prices for immediate cash. Factories are happy to buy these bargains, creating a win-win situation. This is the biggest factor in the recent development of cotton sales. As for Tianjin Chinese fine cotton, the amount being sent south via modified postal packages is increasing daily. Factories have been short of this type of cotton for a long time, and manufacturers welcome it because it can be used as raw material for 32-count yarns. It is said that there are still ample cotton reserves in the countryside, but it is regrettable that they cannot be fully transported out of the country due to being under foreign occupation. Ninety bales of cotton have arrived in Tongzhou from northern Jiangsu. The current cotton situation is listed below:

Laigon Cotton 103.25 Traders bought 200 pieces

Brazilian Cotton 127.00 Traders bought 319 pieces

White Locke 105.00 107.00 Traders bought 800 pieces

Fine Cotton Bales 106.00 Yufeng bought 500 pieces

Pingoer Cotton 82.00 Traders bought 200 pieces

Tianjin Postal Package Cotton 129.00 Traders bought 300 pieces

Another report: Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai, except for Japanese factories, have very low inventory levels, reportedly insufficient for even one month's use. Therefore, there have been some small spot transactions in the market recently. However, the payment terms are all after August 20th.

Foreign cotton market prices: Yesterday, the New York cotton market weakened due to the US government's announcement of the cancellation of the US-Japan commercial treaty. Telegrams from Liverpool also reported declines. Southern sellers followed suit. Subsequently, the banking sector aggressively bought in the market. European buyers were more enthusiastic due to US cotton subsidies. Washington yesterday also signed agreements with France and Switzerland to sell 175,000 bales of US cotton. This cotton is intended for wartime needs, and France and Switzerland cannot freely sell it within five years. Consequently, the cotton is reportedly six yuan cheaper per bale compared to the market price. Yesterday, New York fell 10 points, while India rose one rupee, and Egypt rose eight points.

### Piece Goods: Frequent Delivery of This Month's Futures

Domestic Cloth

Yarn prices are soaring, and the cost for factories differs greatly from the current market, resulting in very enthusiastic trading. Prices rise with every purchase. Yesterday, broadcloth, straight drill, and woolen cloth each rose by 3 to 6 jiao per bolt. New Chun Yuan silk opened at 17 yuan, up 5 jiao from before. Colored cloth and colored twill rose by 2 to 3 jiao. White goods, fine twill, and coarse cloth uniformly increased by 5 fen to 2.5 jiao. Current sales are strongest to Southeast Asian buyers in places like Siam and Singapore, who continue to purchase over 3,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and hemp yarn. Agents from Hong Kong are handling 40 to 50 packages of fine twill. Because the end of the month is approaching, there are many deliveries of expiring futures contracts. Speculators are unwilling to invest due to difficulty in raising funds. Outside investors are slightly more active, with over 200 pieces of fine weave, coarse cloth, fine cloth, broadcloth, and tribute silk being traded. Shandong buyers from Yantai in the north continue to purchase over 50 pieces of Dasheng Yihua 16-pound coarse cloth. Wholesale dealers on this street are handling over 100 packages of coarse cloth and twill.

Eastern Piece Goods

In the morning market, fine cloth and fine twill continued to rise due to the end-of-month short squeeze. Spot prices for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth once opened at 15.75 yuan, but demand weakened in the afternoon, falling back to 15.35 yuan. However, next month's futures still require 15.8 yuan. Other brands are holding firm. Northern buyers continue to add small amounts, with over 200 pieces being traded. There are not many transactions on this street, but traders still expect prices to rise.

Twenty pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 29th.

### Food: Rice Merchants Use Market Closure as a Threat; People's Food Controlled

‚ÄîWuhu Reopening Imminent‚Äî

Domestic Rice: Shanghai rice merchants have recently used market closure as a threat, intending to achieve their goal of manipulating prices and harming the people's food supply. Yesterday, no samples were displayed. Only Jiantou rice at 16 yuan and Bianyuan rice at 22 yuan were traded. The total volume traded was over 2,000 bags. No rice arrived from various sources in the river areas, and only over 1,000 bags of Che Lun Baozi rice arrived. If rice prices in Shanghai fall, local sentiment will naturally improve, and supply will naturally increase. Moreover, the amount of rice stored in Shanghai warehouses has suddenly decreased to over 200,000 bags. It is worth noting whether some of it has been transshipped to other ports. With only one month until the new harvest, and the rice situation being as it is, the authorities should prepare in advance.

Imported Indica: Because the reopening of Wuhu next month is likely to materialize, sellers' buying interest has weakened. Previously absent Suchi Indica and Gao Indica rice were displayed for sale yesterday, but buyers stopped hoarding, and shops only took low-priced goods below 16 yuan. The market immediately declined, but the extent of the decline varied greatly due to the different quality of the goods, falling by 5 to 6 fen, 1 jiao, or more than 2 jiao compared to the previous market. About 2,000 bags were traded.

Foreign Rice: Yesterday, sellers still quoted the original price of 25.5 yuan, but buyers only offered 25 yuan for the new Saigon rice due to the softening of imported Indica, so the two sides could not agree.

### With Active Sales to External Buyers, Flour Mill Prices Will Increase

Flour: Yesterday, the market was quite bullish, likely because external buyers' transactions have gradually become active. Southeast Asian buyers have a good appetite, and North China buyers also have a good appetite because the Tianjin exchange rate is relatively favorable. It is said that Tianjin buyers have already opened a large batch of repurchases, with prices comparable to mill prices. The market has turned firm. Therefore, millers were more determined to sell yesterday. In addition to supplying the daily needs of this street, they are still restricting wholesale sales to external buyers. It is expected that mill prices will officially increase by 5 fen or 1 jiao soon.

Wheat: There is not much supply because inland production prices are quite firm, while prices in Shanghai are mediocre, and only speculators favor the sales destination. Traders have inevitably reduced shipments. Yesterday, Huafen Mill's needs remained quiet, and sales channels for Japanese mills were also weak. Only speculators bought a total of over 2,000 bags of wheat from Guandian, Nanjing, Danyang, Kunshan, Weiting, Changzhou, etc., with prices ranging from 6.95 yuan to 6.45 yuan. The market was flat and weak.

### Miscellaneous Grains: New Yellow Soybeans Enter the Market; Cowhide Yellow at 11.2 Yuan

New yellow soybeans, Cowhide Yellow from Lingkou (not the Changzhou variety), were shipped by the Japanese firm Xintai in 160 bags yesterday. This variety, produced in the Changzhou area, is of superior quality. Although the quality is only about 70% of the best, the seeds are uniform and complete. They were all distributed on this street at a price of 11.2 yuan. (Note: The opening price of the first batch to market last year was only 8.45 yuan.) Dalian soybeans are in a stable position. Yesterday, Hong Kong buyers on this street bought 3 to 4 carloads at prices ranging from 11.5 yuan to 11.38 yuan. The potential of Hankou Zhazao soybeans is feared to be suppressed by the new soybeans because the quality of Zhazao soybeans is similar to that of Cowhide Yellow. Yesterday, the market nominally quoted the original price of 10.02 yuan, but actual sales were very small.

On the 28th, 2,300 bags of soybeans were shipped to Singapore, 4,130 bags of soybeans, 2,470 bags of shelled peanuts, 130 cans of peanut oil, and 1,340 cans of sesame oil were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Taikoo Granulated Sugar Rises Step by Step

According to telegrams from London yesterday, nearby August sugar was at 7 shillings for a small lot of 75, and forward contracts remained at the original price, with no changes. The Shanghai Sugar Association's quotation was unchanged for spot 24 coarse white sugar. Re-exported goods rose by 1 jiao to 25.9 yuan. Taikoo granulated sugar rose by 7 to 8 jiao. West Wharf's B mark was 38.3 yuan, OW mark was 318 yuan, CX mark was 37.5 yuan, DY mark was 37.1 yuan, and HX mark was 36.8 yuan. Spot Dutch red sugar rose by 6 jiao to 28.8 yuan. Several dozen bags of Chao Bang's clear Chung Huang sugar were offered at 23.8 yuan, and over 300 pieces of mixed road green sugar were offered at 22 yuan. Several dozen bags of Ming Jing red sugar were offered at 29.5 yuan. One hundred and fifty bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Glutinous Rice Twigs Rise by 40 Yuan

Glutinous rice twigs have recently become scarce in inventory, and the market has soared. A dozen or so boxes were offered the day before yesterday, reaching a new high price of 220 yuan, an increase of 40 yuan from before. The market outlook is extremely firm.

### Silk and Tea: US-Japan Commercial Treaty Abolished; Japanese Silk Plummets

Overseas silk markets: Yokohama fell 40 yuan due to the US-Japan commercial treaty, and forward contracts fell 34 yuan. New York spot Japanese silk fell 2 fen, while Chinese silk remained unchanged. Standard silk fell 8 fen recently. Considering that the current legal tender is strong at 100 yuan, overseas sales were sluggish yesterday. In Lyon, both Chinese and Japanese silk were sold at the original price.

Local silk market: Because silk prices have reached their peak, those with goods on hand are not waiting, leading to slight discrepancies in Japanese silk prices. White mills are selling both ungraded and 7-8 grade silk at 3,100 yuan. Observing the situation, it can be seen that silk prices are not very normal. Yesterday, exports of raw silk seemed to have stopped. Overseas accounts showed price declines of nearly 30 to 40 yuan, and most were forward contracts, so silk merchants were generally unwilling to dump their goods. Yin Zhuang traded 40 dan of Qian Jin silk yesterday, with a slight increase in price. It is hoped that actual sales will improve.

### Silver and Banking Industry Colleagues Organize a Consumer Cooperative

‚Äî A Wanderer

Solving the threat to livelihood to seek welfare for colleagues. National goods manufacturers sympathizing and offering special discounts.

In the current period of abnormally high living costs, every salaried class is facing a frustrating period of limited means to increase income and no way to reduce expenses. The organization of a consumer cooperative by various groups and enthusiastic individuals is naturally a cause for great rejoicing. Perhaps due to environmental factors, the colleagues of the Yinlianhui (Silver Union Association) can deeply feel the need for such an organization and have quickly established it, which makes us even happier. However, based on Mr. Wanderer's article, it seems that their customers are limited to members and colleagues in the silver and banking industry, and they cannot universally treat general customers. This seems regrettable. Hopefully, they can take a further step to seek welfare for all Shanghai compatriots, which would be truly meritorious. At the same time, it is hoped that other more powerful groups can also quickly organize themselves to enable all Shanghai citizens to overcome this difficult period. (Editor)

Since this newspaper published "Letter from Nineteen Teachers" and "Echoes of Urgent Calls," general small clerks have shared a wave of sympathetic tears. The tragic state of their lives is vividly presented in every corner of society. The call for automatically tightening belts has further exposed the difficulties in the lives of the salaried class.

The re-tightening of foreign exchange in the past three months has stimulated the unlimited soaring of prices. Merchants have taken advantage of the situation to greatly increase the prices of their inventories, especially the price increases of necessities, giving clerks a great threat!

What guarantees are there for the lives of the salaried class in this isolated island? The government's power cannot suppress rising prices. Although many wise authorities understand the actual difficulties in the lives of clerks and subsidize some wartime living allowances, the subsidies ultimately cannot keep up with the mayor's living index. Therefore, the entire clerk class is still threatened by a terrifying fate.

Here, I would like to introduce an organization that uses practical action and the power of unity to reduce the living burden of colleagues - the Silver and Banking Industry Consumer Cooperative, so that clerks throughout the city can emulate the silver and banking industry's spirit of automatically helping others and sincerely cooperating, actively and automatically organize themselves, and shoulder the responsibility of reducing living costs and providing welfare!

In October of last year, the Silver Industry Friendship Association, a unique amateur group in the silver and banking industry, initiated the organization of a consumer cooperative. At that time, more than 200 people enthusiastically participated. Later, it received the support of more than 20 seniors in the silver and banking industry, such as Xu Jici, Lin Kanghou, Qin Runqing, Pei Yunqing, and Wu Yunzhai, which made the purpose of the initiation more deeply rooted in every colleague in the silver and banking industry. During the second resolution seeking movement in March and April, the total number of members surged to nearly 1,000, and the number of shares reached more than 2,600 yuan. This great achievement gave great pleasure and excitement to many enthusiastic staff, so it was decided to convene a founding meeting at the Bank Association on May 21st.

The cooperative under the expectations of 1,000 members requires them to be able to relieve the dual pressure of life, so 600 outstanding young people from the silver and banking industry gathered on the day of the founding meeting to discuss their own welfare-related careers. The charter and many proposals were passed on the spot.

The company has undergone two months of full preparation time and is now scheduled to start business tomorrow (30th). The address is in the Friendship Association, although the location is very narrow. However, it is said that they have already been contacting outside warehouses and offices. Even under the current circumstances, telephone purchases should not be a major problem due to the size of the company address.

The most difficult thing is that the price of goods has risen by 30% to 50% compared to two months ago. So, under the principle of reducing selling prices and serving members, how will the cooperative equip members with the goods they need? Because the items sold on the market are mostly inventory, and the newly created cooperative is all new goods, how can the selling price be reduced? However, under the leadership of their director, Mr. Pan Yangyao, they also successfully obtained the sympathy of many national goods manufacturers, giving them special discounts, and even selling them to the cooperative at prices before the price increase.

Now they have purchased a large batch of white rice and coal briquettes, as well as laundry soap, Wutou brand soy sauce, and other daily household items such as towels, socks, mosquito coils, glassware, and toilet paper, providing for the needs of 1,000 members and 10,000 silver and banking industry colleagues. In the inevitable difficult process at this stage, they will receive some living security and reduce the threat of rising prices.

In order to solemnly handle new business and attract society's attention to the lives of employees, they specially invited Mr. Lin Kanghou to perform the opening ceremony, and asked the authorities of various firms to regularly supervise and care for them, so that they can do some truly beneficial work for their colleagues.

### Mr. Jin Se's Works

### Heroic Lover

‚Äî Ru Hua

"Only Angels Have Wings"

Produced by Columbia, shown at the Da Guangming Theater

Films with aviation as their theme, whether to encourage people to be loyal to the country or to their duties, are always worthy of praise. "Heroic Lover" writes about a group of young pilots who are loyal to their duties. They risk danger in dense fog to fly planes to deliver mail, and the sincere friendship of this group of young people. However, "Heroic Lover" committed a common flaw of general films, that is, the lack of unity in the story: The encounter between pilot Zuo Yi and Pony, and their visit together, and Zuo Yi's death in a plane crash, can form a separate segment; Mike Bo's joining the aviation team is another segment. Although the playwright uses Pony's passionate love for Card as the medium connecting the two, there is always a gap that cannot communicate with each other.

The director's skill is quite high in handling this complex and extremely tense story. First, because of the monotony of the background, he rendered the local color very thickly. This is his cleverness. For example: when he began to introduce the port of Baranca in South America, the streets shrouded in dense fog, the sketches of tropical people, the special customs of small bars, music, songs... all fully outlined the unique mood of the tropics, and finally, he used quiet singing to accompany Card's emotional conflict, which is even more lovely.

The romance between Card and Pony is written very vaguely, and because of the occurrence of many tense scenes, the medium that the playwright used to connect the two segments is even more powerless. As for the thrilling scenes in the air, perhaps too many films of this kind have been seen. I think that the plane crash in the later scenes is not as moving as the one in which Zuo Yi was killed.

The scene where Zuo Yi was killed is like this: Zuo Yi was very happy after meeting Pony; suddenly, he was ordered to fly a plane to deliver mail; the sky was heavily foggy. Card ordered him to temporarily return to the airfield via radio, and land after the fog cleared; Card, Pony and colleagues responded via radio near the airfield; the sound of the plane got closer and closer; the searchlight was on; the plane was forced to land on the ground. Card shouted "Rise!"; the crowd was tense; the plane landed abruptly; a huge sound was heard, and the ambulance was dispatched; Card and Pony were in pain; although there was a front-facing shot of Zuo Yi's plane crash later in the scene, the suffocating atmosphere reached its peak. Card, the commander-in-chief of Craig Gland, was quite calm. Pony, played by Keith Arthur, is just cute.

Episode 14: Fireworks in Thousands of Homes in Rural Cooperation, Waves in Ten Thousand Miles of Overseas Flight

Indeed, undertaking construction projects is his profession, focusing on everything in his profession, and it cannot disturb their marriage. When building the factory building, he also built a villa. Although this Mr. He had said to his two daughters: "That villa does not need to be very large, just enough for their family and daughters to live in temporarily." Mr. He's intention was because Shanghai was too lively. Therefore, he wanted to leave Shanghai and find a quiet place to build several houses as a place for rest. However, he could not be too far away from Shanghai, so that he could get to Shanghai in two or three hours if something happened. Mr. He's two daughters felt that our factory base was here, and the villa was also here, which was the most appropriate thing. And it is not very far from Shanghai. This Freedom Village is quiet in the midst of the bustling city, and it also meets the conditions of my father, and my father will definitely agree. It's just that the villa, although my father said it doesn't need to be too large, should not be too small. Because my father's current occupation is to handle various international trade matters, and he has many wealthy foreign businessmen and big buyers to deal with. Occasionally, if he invites them to take a day trip to the suburbs, he can also invite them to his home, so this house can be regarded as our country villa. This kind of country villa is common in Europe and America. Therefore, their intention is that the house does not need to be too large, but it needs a large garden. The garden does not need to be too luxurious, but it needs a large lawn. A place where garden parties can be held in the summer to accommodate dozens of guests is necessary. There is also one more thing. Originally, Mr. He and his two daughters came out of their home, but Mr. He's mother and her younger brother were still in Guangzhou. This mother is not the biological mother of the two Mr. He's daughters. The mother who gave birth to the twins of Mr. He's daughters has already passed away. But the mother in Guangzhou at the moment is a stepmother. They also have two younger brothers, one who is eleven years old this year, and one who is eight years old this year, but they do not have any younger sisters. These two younger brothers are still studying in elementary school, so Mr. He did not bring them to Shanghai. Now that there is a villa in Shanghai, this stepmother may bring her two younger brothers here. Even if they don't live here permanently, it is perfectly fine to live here for dozens of days, or to play for a month or two in the summer vacation. In that case, the house must also be prepared, and it cannot be too cramped. Therefore, the general situation of the construction of this villa must be asked of my father. If my father does not have any familiar construction engineers in Shanghai, then you can tell my father and entrust Lin Jiancheng to design and make samples. (164)

### Kunming's Prices

Because inland transportation is blocked and transportation is inconvenient, and few national goods factories have moved to the inland, the goods are all transported from various places, so the prices in Kunming are soaring endlessly. Not to mention imported goods, even local native products are so expensive that people are speechless. Just looking at the following daily necessities, people can't help but sigh. Toothpaste is 8 jiao per tube. Soap is 1 yuan per bar.

Toothbrush (ordinary) is 1 yuan per piece. Snow cream is 1.6 yuan per bottle.

Rice price is 32 yuan per stone. Pork is 8 jiao per catty.

Western-style shirts (poplin) are 7 yuan per piece. (Spun silk) is 10 yuan per piece.

(Twill) is 6 yuan per piece.

From this, it can be seen that the Shanghai factories of national goods migrating to the inland is not only necessary, but also an urgent matter.

### Joy (7)

Christ's truth is broad, profound, and refined. Why waste pen ink on just the two words "joy"? Indeed, the two words "joy" are the most reliable and accurate experience for Christians, so it is necessary to speak of joy first. When the Holy Apostle Paul wrote letters, he spent more than 3,000 words specifically on the two words "joy" (Philippians), but joy is most important to the true way. If someone says: I believe in Christ, but I don't have joy. I say: You don't have the initial experience yet, so you can't talk about Christ's true way, because there is a problem with your faith. Furthermore, someone says: I believe in Christ, and my joy is sometimes strong and sometimes weak, sometimes present and sometimes absent, which is what is commonly called a wave-like life. I say: Your initial experience is not true, which is exactly that your faith is not true. You need to investigate it from faith, and you don't need to investigate it from joy.

Joy: Since it is the beginning of a Christian, and not a mysterious principle, then, can the world have someone who understands it? I say: Yes. Confucius and Yan Hui understand it, and all of Confucius and Yan Hui's disciples understand it, so it can be called true joy. I give an example: When Confucius's disciples once talked about their aspirations, they mentioned a passage about a wind-like dance of joy, and Confucius praised it loudly, admiring them to the point of worshipping the ground. This is that kind of joy. This kind of joy is the unity of Heaven (God) and man. The ancient and modern sages and philosophers all understand it. Although they understand it, the path to joy is quite difficult to find, so the world has no way to seek it. The reason is that Heaven (God) and man are too far apart, and man has no way to communicate with Heaven. Only Christ is both man and God, and is the mediator between God and man. Man can communicate with God through Christ. When God and man communicate, it is the unity of Heaven and man. The truth and greatness of joy is no more than this.

Old Newspaper Rewrites: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (104)

(See this newspaper from the 11th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)

### Diplomatic History of Burma

France has annexed several provinces of Annam, and is now coveting Burma. Because Burma and Annam are adjacent and intertwined, it is inevitable that France will use its whale-like swallowing. The former envoy to France returned to his country, and when he returned to his post, the French court specially ordered him to go to Burma along the way. This must be hiding malicious intentions, and they will take the opportunity to start a war, divide and occupy territory, and dominate. One of the envoy's entourage had a great argument, and his outstanding opinions were published in the French-language newspaper. Tracing back, Burma is a descendant of Korea, and has always been a protective screen for China. It paid tribute and called itself a subject, and has been devoted to the Emperor for hundreds of years without communicating with France. Recently, it sent an envoy to Europe, and was able to interact with France. However, the Prince of Burma has insufficient knowledge and foolish behavior, and has failed to manage the country well, so foreign troubles have taken advantage. Previously, it angered Britain, and the war led to the cession of southern Burma. The King of Burma was ashamed of this and repeatedly tried to recover it. In 1857, he sent a Westerner named Lu Zhidun as an envoy to Europe. He thought he had obtained the title of General of Ten Villages of Burma, and then showed off. He really didn't know how Westerners managed to gain favor with the King of Burma. After receiving the King's order to be an envoy to Paris, the capital of France, Lu Zhidun arrogantly called himself an imperial envoy, and wanted France to treat him with the etiquette of an imperial envoy. The French court did not regard him as an envoy, so it did not treat him with courtesy, but only allowed him to request the elite military equipment and workers of France to go to his country to work, because the King of Burma wanted to build an armory in his country. In 1871, the Italian navy was ordered to sail warships to Burma, wanting to knock on the door and ask for an audience, and sign a treaty to trade. Then the King of Burma specially sent another envoy to France, Italy, and Britain. The envoy knew the languages and writing of Britain and France quite well, and there was another Englishman who was proficient in Burmese to assist him, but the three countries did not treat him with the etiquette of an envoy. However, France sent an envoy to Burma as a reply, and the gifts he brought were quite brilliant and dazzling.

### Summer Chats in the Movie City

‚Äî (Feng Xiang)

Ice Cream is a Fattening Agent - Actresses Abstain - Called Back to Film During Vacation - Complaints Abound

The summer monsoon has blown the heat wave into Hollywood, filling the movie city with the atmosphere of high summer. The actresses are all wearing new summer outfits, exposing as much of their sensual beauty as possible, and putting on sunglasses to block the strong sunlight. Outdoor refreshment stands have also opened for business, selling ice cream, various fruit juices, and mint preparations, and business is booming. But at the same time, a miracle has been discovered. This miracle is the unanimous report from the refreshment stand owners: They say that among their goods, ice cream is the least popular among the actresses, because ice cream contains nutritious ingredients such as cream and egg yolks, which cause weight gain (although a little bit wouldn't matter). "Weight gain" is the nemesis of graceful figures, so it's no wonder they regard it as something to abstain from and give up eating.

Secondly, it is worth mentioning... In this season of "summer, just right for having fun," outdoor sports such as tennis and swimming are very popular among the movie stars. Some movie stars take advantage of the holiday season to temporarily escape the bustling city and go to the nearby countryside for a rest, living a quiet life. However, even during the holidays, film company authorities will call them back to film at any time, which is really a disappointing thing. Therefore, complaints are inevitable. Beit Heeler is one of them. After he just co-starred with Marie Wilson in a comedy with a football game as the background (Lighthorse Harry) (Warner's new film), he wanted to forget everything and return to his villa for a vacation. Unexpectedly, a few days later, he received a summons from the company, calling him back to work immediately. He said dejectedly that next time he would learn Errol Flynn's trick of sailing a sailboat abroad, so that he could wander around and the company would have no way to urge him.

Random Notes on Artists

### Past and Present (Part 2)

‚Äî Wang Yin

But the winds and clouds of the Northeast rose, stirring up a kind of angry tide throughout the country. Films of gods, monsters, martial arts, and chivalry were immediately regarded as poisonous things, and suffered serious criticism from public opinion. My mind became clear because of the invisible condemnation. In fact, I was not allowed to continue acting in this kind of film that anesthetized the audience's nerves, so I began to be cautious. I would only accept film topics that did not violate the times. But unfortunately, the "January 28th" incident followed one after another, and the fragile Chinese film industry could not withstand the destruction and was completely paralyzed, which made me hesitate for a while. However, this was tantamount to giving the chaotic film industry a head-on blow. After the film industry gradually recovered, the productions of various companies had mostly changed their style, and I also got the opportunity to serve the film again. I joined Yihua Film Company, changed my name to the current one, and successively starred in "The Angry Tide of the Chinese Sea" and "Escape," and began to meet the audience with a new look. At this time, I gradually felt satisfied with my work performance.

Yihua was full of vitality at the beginning of its establishment, and all its productions were able to raise the eyebrows of domestic films. But unfortunately, because of external oppression and the increasingly worsening national affairs, it finally had to take a passive path. Because of the restrictions of the contract, I successively starred in several films that were close to low taste, such as "Wedding Night" and "Incarnation Girl," the content of which was in absolute opposition to "The Angry Tide of the Chinese Sea" and "Escape," and finally did not receive good reviews.

The sound of cannons of "August 13th" rang again! It left a deep scar on the impoverished Chinese film industry, and everything was paralyzed.

Later, Mr. Zhang Shanxian first restored Xinhua Film Company with the greatest perseverance, and invited me to join the Xinhua front. At first, I used the film "Miss Tomboy," produced in Hong Kong, as my first work to serve Xinhua. Although this is also a soft film, what is more satisfactory is that the essence of the film does not have any poison. However, I always hope that I will no longer appear in this type of film in the future. Until now, my wish has finally been realized. Now I am engaged in the direction of "Desperate Bandit," and at the same time, I am also serving as the leading actor. The narrative of "Desperate Bandit" is aimed at the current real society, and it tells the story of blood and tears that can be seen everywhere, the story of a young worker who sacrifices everything to save a prostitute. I am confident that this script is not too bad.

It's just that my ability is limited, and the director's work is the first time I have tried it, so I can't help but feel a little timid. Perhaps the "achievement" will not be as satisfactory as I want, but I still did my best to do it. Success or failure, that is just "disregarded," as another question.

### Idle Talk About the Entertainment World

‚Äî Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

(11) Sutane (Suzhou Tanci)

In inverse proportion to the fate of Shenqu Opera, Sutane has already embarked on the road of decline.

Sutane scripts are divided into "Front Sutane" and "Back Sutane." "Adopting a Son," "Sending a Son," "Broken Bridge," and "Combining Bowls" are "Front Sutane," while "Ma Langdang" and "Selling Olives" are "Back Sutane."

Front Sutane is more laborious, while Back Sutane is more casual. Under the general reason that Sutane actors "fear difficulty and are greedy for laziness," Front Sutane will tend to be lost.

If it doesn't cheer up again, the future of Sutane is very bleak!

### The Responsibility of Journalists

The weather a few days ago was always so windy and rainy, which was very depressing. I went to the Golden Theater to listen to Yan Jupeng's "White Emperor City," but I didn't expect my depression to increase, and I even got sick. I was sick for three days, feeling bored and helpless. I casually dragged out a copy of Su Dongpo's Memorials, and there was a passage in it that I felt was somewhat related to our press circles, so I wrote it down below:

Since the Jianlong era, no one has ever been convicted for a word (excerpt) When words touched upon the imperial carriage, the emperor changed his expression. When matters were heard in the court, the prime minister awaited punishment. Therefore, in the era of Emperor Renzong, those who criticized the prime minister only followed the tenor of the censorate. The deep meaning of the sage, how could the vulgar people know it? The censors are certainly not all virtuous, and what they say is not necessarily all correct, but it is necessary to cultivate their sharpness and cherish their heavy power. Is it only for nothing?

The censors mentioned above undoubtedly represent the mouthpiece of public opinion. Are they not somewhat similar to the current journalists? When we read the above record, we can imagine that the speech of that era can be regarded as extremely free. When I was resting in Yushan (one or two years before August 13th), I also wrote several articles discussing politics and economics. Unfortunately, some predictions have now come true. Some records of the historical facts of local corrupt officials also made me feel happy, but in the end, I burned all these manuscripts myself. I think that rather than flattering the powerful, I would rather flatter innocent girls. Rather than writing great articles that do not express my feelings, I would rather write playful articles that express my thoughts freely. These words are because an elder advised me, saying that I have a relative who used to write trendy economic and political articles a few years ago, and later became rich. Now he is already looking down on everyone. You have this skill in writing dance manuscripts, so you might as well play that game too, and you might be able to win an opportunity to become an official and get rich. But I am a fool, how can I do this kind of smart thing? Therefore, rather than trying to be clever, I would rather hide my clumsiness.

Dancing is only a part of the entertainment world. Compared to the entire social cause, it is even more of a drop in the ocean. However, just in terms of Shanghai, there are no less than tens of thousands of people who live here (including the families of all practitioners), and no less than tens of thousands of people who relax here. Therefore, this problem cannot be considered small. Since we are shouldering the mission of representing the mouthpiece of the people, we are of course responsible for these many people. When we write dance manuscripts, first of all, we must use good intentions to examine and criticize, and not wantonly ridicule. Secondly, we must use justice to establish our words, and clearly analyze the changing ways of earning and spending money, the scope that should be followed, and the rights and obligations that should be enjoyed. Then, we must point out the evil consequences of overstepping the boundaries. Thirdly... There are too many things to say.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

The Meaning of the Ten-Minute Break Before the Main Show

According to our foolish thoughts, whenever many people gather in one place, it is always the most difficult to maintain order. Let's take teahouses, taverns, and theaters all together. Everyone spends money to have fun, hoping to satisfy their eyes, ears, mouths, and noses as much as possible, so that everyone's spirit can be expressed and happy as much as possible. Therefore, things like high-profile discussions in teahouses, shouts and calls in taverns, and applause and cheers in theaters all express a kind of chaotic and noisy situation. When the star is singing and acting on the stage in the theater, even if he doesn't sing well, as long as he doesn't stop, then the order will not be too chaotic. The only thing to be afraid of is that the stage will cool down, and you will only hear the sound of gongs and drums, and you will not see a single person. At that time, the audience will riot. In the past, Yu Sansheng (Shuyan's grandfather) and the famous Qingyi Hu Xilu co-starred in "Visiting Mother." On that day, Xilu was late due to an accident. The manager asked Old Yu to "fill in." So Sansheng actually sang sixty or seventy "I feel like" until Xilu arrived. Also, whenever a play is over and the next play cannot be connected, a clown will always fill in the gap with small plays such as "Visiting the Lantern Fair" and "Inviting a Doctor" to slow down the time. But in any case, the gongs will never be cut off midway or the stage will stop moving.

When I suggested changing Peiping into a cultural city, I also proposed to create a municipal theater. However, before the municipal theater is built, I drafted more than a dozen suggestions for improving the old drama, preparing to promote their implementation as soon as possible. The most important thing is because the old-style theaters in Peiping are too unsanitary, and they are built very narrowly, the seats are uncomfortable, and it is very difficult to get in and out. The most annoying thing is the vendors selling scattered food, holding a basket of things high, squeezing back and forth in front of the audience, and at the same time, the sound of selling is endless. If you want to show a disgusted look, scold him a few words, or put your left leg on your right leg and don't let him pass, then he will come even more frequently. (69)
