### The German Army Completely Outflanks and Crosses the River; Warsaw is Attacked from All Sides; Mechanized Units Attacked the Outskirts Again but Were Repelled; the Transportation Line to Romania is in Danger of Being Cut Off

Beattie - According to reliable sources today, the German army has broken through five major Polish defense lines (United Press dispatch from the 15th).

Paris - According to French sources here, the French side has officially acknowledged today that German forces have penetrated deep behind the Vistula River, so the Polish army's base for its final resistance is increasingly threatened, and the German army is advancing extremely rapidly, making it difficult for the Polish army to resist. French newspapers all acknowledge that the German victory in Poland is undeniable, and the Polish war has now entered a phase of mixed warfare, with no front lines to speak of. The Polish right wing has now retreated to the eastern lake and swamp area (United Press dispatch from the 15th).

Paris - The "Paris Echo" reports that the two armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting over the transportation route between Poland and Hungary and Romania, and the situation is extremely serious. Although the Polish rainy season is late in coming, it may still be of great help to Polish Commander-in-Chief Rydz-Śmigły. The "Times" also stated that Germany's desire is to completely isolate the Polish army, and the only way for the German army to achieve this goal is to cut off the Polish army's transportation to Romania, forcing them to retreat to the Pinsk Marshes and eventually reach the Soviet border (Reuters dispatch from the 15th).

Danzig - A dispatch from the "Political News" in Berlin states that Germany is currently doing everything it can to quickly conquer Poland. Because Germany is eager to achieve its goals, it issued a notice via wireless electricity, urging the Polish people to surrender immediately, or their country will be completely destroyed. The German army in Poland is now engaged in an operation: (1) completely encircling Warsaw, (2) cutting off the transportation between the new Polish capital Lublin and Lviv, (3) the German army in East Prussia is advancing towards Brest-Litovsk in the area of ​​Grodno, 180 miles east of Warsaw. The German side claims that the German army is advancing rapidly and has encountered little resistance in southern Poland. It is now gradually cutting off supplies from countries such as Romania to Poland. The German army has also reached Rava-Ruska on the road from Lublin to Lviv and has crossed the Vistula River at several points north of Sandomierz (Reuters dispatch from the 15th).

Warsaw - The General Headquarters issued a war report at 11 o'clock tonight, stating that the German army used armored vehicles and tanks to attack the outskirts of Warsaw in the Wola area. Our army immediately launched a head-on counterattack, inflicting heavy casualties on them, and capturing several armored vehicles and destroying one tank. Today, German aircraft continued to wantonly bomb the outskirts of Warsaw, and many houses in the town of Praga were hit and burned. Other places such as Dubno, Volozhin, Miedzyrzec, and Radziwiłłów (all in southeastern Poland) were also bombed. Our army shot down two German aircraft. Our air force bombed German motorized units near Rava-Ruska, southeast of Warsaw, with great success. The German army in East Prussia has invaded Poland in the Suwałki area. German troops are said to have been spotted in Piaseczno and Pisz, east of Warsaw, but our army is standing by in the western end of the Pialowiecze Forest. A fierce battle took place in the area between Łuków and Garwolin, southeast of Warsaw. A German motorized unit and an infantry regiment have been annihilated by our army. The fighting is fierce in the area between Łowicz and Skierniewice, southwest of Warsaw. German motorized units south of Lublin have crossed the San River and advanced to Zamość, and another unit attacking Lviv has been repelled (Havas dispatch from the fourth).

Berlin - The German High Command issued a war report this morning stating that the right wing of the German Eastern Army crossed the road between Lublin and Lviv on September 14. The enemy troops in Kutno attempted to break through to the southeast but failed. The German army has crossed the east bank of the Vistula River and is encircling Warsaw from the north, east, and southeast (Haitong dispatch from the 15th).

Lublin - Two weeks have passed since the war between Poland and Germany began. A military expert recently commented on the situation of the war, stating that the Polish army in the center, between Łódź and Warsaw, is in a good position. In addition to maintaining contact with the main force, it has also recovered Łódź. However, on the northern and southern fronts, it has been under heavy pressure. The German army is adopting a foreign strategy, using flanking maneuvers to encircle the Polish army in the center and annihilate it in one fell swoop. The German army once launched a frontal assault on Warsaw four days ago, but failed to take it. Therefore, it changed its strategy. The German army in the south used motorized units to invade the plains between the San River and the Dniester River and crossed the San River on both sides of the Przemyśl fortress, entering the Ukrainian region. One unit reached the upper reaches of the Dniester River, south of Lviv, but avoided the Romanian border and advanced to the northeast. One unit probed Lviv, but was repelled by the Polish army. Another unit marched north from the east of the Przemyśl fortress, straight to the upper reaches of the Bug River, intending to probe Brest-Litovsk, east of Warsaw. The German army in the north intends to cross the river near the lower reaches of the Bug River, pressing on Warsaw and Siedlce. In short, after the German army changed its strategy, the Polish army felt a major threat, which is undeniable (Havas dispatch from the 14th).

### French Troops Consolidate Their Positions on the Western Front; Launch New Attacks Under Heavy Fire; Local Advances Result in Some Prisoners; German Authorities Evacuate Border Residents

Beijing - Yesterday evening, the French army began an offensive near Fehr in the Moselle region on the western end of the Franco-German border. Observers on the Luxembourg border saw French heavy artillery bombard, followed by tank operations. German outposts were forced to retreat, and their engineers blew up a railway line to prevent the French army from advancing. The sound of artillery could be heard as far as the capital of Luxembourg, and the Luxembourg authorities immediately ordered the evacuation of the people of Hingen in the southernmost part of Luxembourg (Reuters dispatch from the 15th).

Paris - According to French military sources received here, the French army has now controlled the highlands southwest of Saarbrücken, and claims that the French army has captured some German prisoners, but the number is not specified. French casualties are minor. At present, the city of Saarbrücken is still in German hands, and industry in the city has stopped, and there are few residents. The French army today bombed the exits behind the city, and the German artillery bombed the French positions south of the city. Due to the bad weather, air reconnaissance was difficult, but the German army is still trying to find the location of the French positions east and west of the city (Reuters dispatch from the 15th).

Paris - The General Headquarters has just issued War Report No. 22, saying, "Our army continued to make local progress today, with some prisoners" (Havas dispatch from the 14th).

Paris - The General Headquarters has just issued War Report No. 23, saying, "The enemy launched a counterattack from the 10th of this month onwards, east of the Meuse River northeast of Thionville, fighting with our army for the position here, but after days of fighting, our army has established a stable foundation and advanced further. Until last night, our front line made local progress again under heavy enemy fire" (Havas dispatch from the 15th).

Luxembourg - At 4 p.m., the French army launched an offensive in the area of ​​Berg (on the banks of the Moselle River, facing the town of Schengen in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg across the river), with ten tanks and heavy artillery cover. The German outposts could not hold out and retreated, and the railway from Trier (in Germany) to Metz (in France) was destroyed. The authorities of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, due to the proximity of the war to the border, have ordered customs officials and border guards to withdraw from the town of Schengen, and the residents there have also begun to evacuate (Havas dispatch from the 14th).

The Capital of Belgium - According to reliable sources, the German authorities have ordered the residents of cities near the Siegfried Line in western Germany to "temporarily" evacuate (Reuters dispatch from the 15th).

The Capital of the Netherlands - The General Report here recently carried a dispatch from a Berlin correspondent stating that the French army's attack on the Siegfried Line has been quite successful, and the German military authorities are quite anxious, so they are planning to end the Polish war as soon as possible so that they can transfer the elite troops from the eastern front to the west to resist the French offensive (Havas dispatch from the 15th).

### The Polish War is Critical

London - Most optimistic observers believe that Poland's position is quite critical. Polish sources admit that fierce fighting is now taking place in Garwolin, 15 miles east of Warsaw. It is now known that the German strategy is not only to occupy Warsaw, but its purpose is far beyond that. It is reported that a strong German force is now advancing southeast from the East Prussian border towards Brest-Litovsk, and the German army in the south is attacking Lviv, while also advancing towards Tomaszów and Rava-Ruska, between Lviv and Lublin. Their purpose seems to be to encircle the entire triangle surrounded by the Bug River, the San River, and the Vistula River, in order to cut off the Polish army's communications. To complete this plan, the German army must quickly concentrate its most mobile units in several pre-determined locations in order to break through the Polish army and prevent it from counterattacking. However, this German plan actually contains great dangers, because the transportation lines are too long and have many weaknesses, resulting in slow supplies. The recent Polish recovery of Łódź is a clear proof of this, and it can be seen that the German army is negligent in its rear defenses. Some observers predict that a part of the Polish army will break out of the above-mentioned triangle and will attack from the left and right when the German army attempts to encircle it. At present, elite Polish reinforcements have rushed to the rescue of Lviv and the transportation route between Poland and Romania. The German army is now trying to occupy the oil fields of Drohobycz and Boryslav, but the Poles have already made preparations for destruction. According to various observers here, on the Western Front, the German army seems to have withdrawn its air force from Poland due to the pressure from the French army. Last week, British and French aircraft took a large number of photos of the Siegfried Line, estimating that the territory occupied by the French army in Germany is 500 square miles (Reuters dispatch from the 15th).

### The Polish Government Moves the Capital Again; Adjacent to the Soviet Border

Cernăuți, Romania - The Italian Ambassador to Poland, Valentino, and the American Ambassador to Poland, Biddle, recently followed the Polish government to Kremenets (in southern Poland, adjacent to the Soviet border) and arrived in Cernăuți today (in northern Romania, bordering Poland). They said that the Polish authorities are able to cope with the war situation calmly and are doing everything possible to defend their country. The Italian ambassador also said that the Polish positions are gradually becoming stronger and will be more stable in a few days. In addition, the rainy season in Poland will affect the German motorized units, and the situation of the war can be expected to change greatly in the future (Havas dispatch from the 15th).

Rome - After the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel Beck, moved to Kremenets to work, the embassies of various countries in Poland also moved there one after another. Until yesterday, German aircraft flew to the area to bomb it. It is now learned that all personnel of the French Embassy, ​​except for Ambassador Noël, have evacuated from the city to Czerniejów (near the Romanian border) (Havas dispatch from the 14th).

Rome - According to news received here, the Romanian-Polish border was completely closed the day before yesterday. Except for Polish people who hold formal passports and have them signed by a consul, all illegal crossings into the Romanian border are impossible. Since the train between Lviv and Chernivtsi is out of service, some foreigners traveling in Poland have escaped to Romania by car. Those who have arrived in Rome now include the Bulgarian, Danish, and Brazilian ministers and the French embassy's military attaché (Haitong dispatch from the 15th).

### Poland Condemns German Aircraft for Indiscriminate Bombing of Civilians

London - According to a report from the Polish Embassy, ​​in the first three days of the German invasion of Poland (ending September 3), 1,500 civilians died and thousands were injured, with women and children accounting for the majority of the casualties. Although Prime Minister Hitler assured President Roosevelt that he would not bomb civilians, the German army has not stopped bombing civilians (United Press dispatch from the 15th).

London - Sir Kennard, the British Ambassador to Poland, today confirmed the report to the US State Department by the US Ambassador to Poland, Biddle, regarding the German bombing of undefended Polish cities (United Press dispatch from the 14th).

Warsaw - According to a communiqué issued here, the residence of the Papal Nuncio and the Praga Hospital were destroyed during today's German air raid (Reuters dispatch from the 15th).

Kremenets, Poland - After government agencies and embassies of various countries moved here from Warsaw, several German aircraft flew here on the 12th of this month to bomb and strafe densely populated areas with machine guns. Many civilians were either killed or injured. Afterwards, the heads of various countries held a meeting, and Pope Ambassador Cortesi was elected as the chairman. He said that the transfer of the diplomatic corps to this place has been notified to the German government by the Dutch Minister to Poland (Germany entrusts the Dutch Minister to protect its interests in Poland). However, the aircraft of that country actually bombed the area, which is not right. Therefore, it was decided to apply to their respective governments to lodge a strong protest with the German government (Havas dispatch from the 15th).

Paris - Lviv issued a wireless broadcast, opposing the barbarism of the German army, saying that German aircraft are now wantonly bombing towns and villages in southern and central Poland, and the situation is extremely tragic. It also said that Hitler ordered his air force to destroy everything that resisted without mercy. The German air force is now implementing this order. It is reported that Lublin is burning fiercely (Reuters dispatch from the 15th).

### Poland Asks Britain and France to Provide More Effective Assistance

London - Yesterday, Poland requested the British government to provide more effective assistance during the war against Germany. The request was made by the Polish Ambassador to London, Raczynski, to the British Foreign Office (United Press dispatch from the 15th).

London - Political figures here recently stated that German troops have penetrated deep into southern Poland and are using aircraft to bomb the transportation lines between Poland and Romania, with the intention of threatening the Balkans. 'Therefore, the question of the Balkan countries forming a front to respond together is becoming acute. Diplomatic figures further observed that Germany's expansion movement may not stop with Poland, but will threaten the countries along the Black Sea (referring to Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey) and extend to the Persian Gulf. This threat was originally recognized by the democratic countries of Western Europe, which had a mutual assistance agreement with Turkey and formulated it clearly, and provided Turkey with a large amount of credit so that the country could become a mainstay in the anti-German axis in the Balkans. In addition, Germany is said to be planning to economically force Romania to sell all of its exports, especially oil, to Germany. If so, Romania may refuse to maintain its neutrality and defend itself by force if necessary. However, how strong its resistance is is also quite questionable. Britain and France are now studying what methods can be used to provide Romania with large-scale assistance so that it can actively participate in the Balkan defense front. All of these matters are without credible news to confirm. However, it can be asserted that when Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Polish Ambassador Raczynski and French Ambassador Corbin today, in addition to discussing how to reduce the pressure of the German army on Poland, they also touched on the Balkan issue (Havas dispatch from the 14th).

### Major German Cities Evacuate Population; Food Consumption is Restricted

Berlin - The government authorities have taken various measures to evacuate residents of major cities, numbering 18 million to 20 million. This has already begun in the western cities. Also, art treasures in major cities have been moved to towns and villages (Havas dispatch from the 15th).

Berlin - The government yesterday issued another order restricting the consumption of various foods. The amount of butter that each person can purchase per week is limited to 50 grams. This butter is also mixed with a large amount of whale oil, which has a very strong fishy smell when cooked. In order to stabilize people's hearts, the newspapers have all published news saying that a certain chemical technician has invented an "artificial butter" that can be used as food. The local guidance newspaper said that the manufacture of soap must consume 60% of the national production of fat. At a time when fat is scarce, people must save soap (Havas dispatch from the 15th).

### London Entertainment Venues Reopen

London - After Britain declared war on Germany, London's theaters and cinemas were ordered to close. They were only lifted today, and the general situation in society has returned to normal. The only difference is that in the past resplendent uniformed doormen are no longer coming and going in front of the cinemas, replaced by air defense personnel to protect public safety when an air raid alarm is issued. In addition, football matches will also be held as usual (Havas dispatch from the 15th).

Editorial

### The Disaster in Hebei

How tragic is the life of the residents in the occupied areas? This is indeed undeniable, and there is no need to elaborate; because it is already known far and wide, and it can also be imagined. In addition to the ravages of war and the oppression of traitors, they have also suffered natural disasters; such as the dozens of counties in Hebei Province and millions of people who have been suddenly flooded by a merciless flood. How tragic is this? A month has passed, and we really don't know how to start a word to comfort the victims.

The various situations in Hebei are not known in detail by outsiders; even the current flood, we only know that hundreds of miles are in the ocean, and people and animals are drifting; we only know that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has been repeatedly interrupted; we only know that the water in the British, French, and Japanese concessions in Tianjin is also five or six feet or even more than a zhang deep; we only know that single-story houses are submerged, and only the second floor of three-story buildings can be seen; we only know that the Japanese army's munitions losses are countless. If the Japanese army's munitions are damaged, can the losses of the poor and helpless people be asked? If such a disaster occurred in a time of peace, how would it be covered in domestic and foreign newspapers, and how would it win the sympathy of the world? Now, even the paper reporting this disaster is almost falling along with the land, which is also a tragedy for the nation and the victims in the disaster area.

The state has an obligation to provide disaster relief for natural disasters. China has had many natural disasters since ancient times, so the organization and efficiency of disaster relief have been remarkable due to practical needs and accumulated experience. The central and local governments and society respond to each other and cooperate with each other, and both their spirit and strength are commendable. Only the victims in the Hebei disaster area have not benefited. Is it that the National Government has abandoned its people and sat idly by watching the disaster, or that the compatriots in other provinces are indifferent and cold and do not provide assistance; no, it is the situation that forbids it, and the whip is too long to reach and the desire to save has failed. We really don't know whether the local organizations in the Hebei disaster area and the organizations in the neighboring disaster areas have also done anything about this natural disaster. Judging by our own minds, it is unlikely. The northern society was not wealthy in the first place, let alone after repeated ravages, displacement, and the suspension of all industries, and the exhaustion of vitality. How can it provide disaster relief! The puppets and their ilk are conscienceless and sick, and their ambition is to exploit and tyrannize the villagers, and they have no time to care about the hungry and drowning. The Japanese have been fighting for two years, and their national strength is exhausted. For the military-occupied areas, they are planning to drain the pond to catch all the fish and hope to "use war to support war." They are eager for what they are eager for, and they do not care about anything. Even their European and American allies, who are always compassionate and generous in the face of any disaster, are very different from what they have done in the past in Hebei. The truth is that the world situation is in danger, firstly; the blockade of the Tianjin concession has a direct impact on the real lives of Europeans and Americans, secondly; doing good for the public takes stability as a prerequisite, but now they are being oppressed and unable to take care of themselves, thirdly; doing good deeds in China is actually sharing the business profits. In recent years, those who have been doing business in North China have been crowded out, there is no business to run, no profit to be made, and their situation is precarious, and their future is bleak, fourthly. In short, no one provides disaster relief. Alas, the country has not been destroyed, but the family has been broken first, and the disaster of man is deep and the disaster of heaven is coming again; alas, this remnant of the people, calling for help with no way, almost no such tragedy in ancient and modern times.

Now there is no other hope, but that the National Government will restore the lost land as soon as possible and appease the disaster areas, but delay will not help the emergency. I hope that God will bless us, and the flood will flow east as soon as possible; but after the water recedes, there will still be famine, and there will be no escape from the epidemic; even if there is no hunger or disease. However, the autumn in the north is cold, how can the victims not be cold! As for the current plan, I only hope that charitable organizations that transcend national boundaries will see the righteousness and lead the way, and not give way when it comes to doing good deeds. Call on people at home and abroad to do their best. It is also impossible not to hope for the Japanese to abandon their occupation for the sake of humanity, and at least hope for the sake of humanity to remove all obstacles; so that the tragedy of the disaster can be known to the world, and those who provide disaster relief can have the convenience of measures.

### U.S. Government Statement: Determined to Uphold Rights in China; Attackers of American Ships Will Incur Disadvantage; British Interception of American Ships Being Released Successively

Washington D.C. Secretary of State Hull issued a formal statement today clarifying the United States' attitude toward the belligerent countries' blockade actions, stating that the U.S. government reserves all rights of the United States and its people under international law and will implement any plans it deems most appropriate and proper when any belligerent country undermines these rights. The U.S. government has notified American shipping companies of dangerous areas and warned American citizens and shipping companies not to risk other actual dangers caused by lawful or unlawful actions of belligerent countries. The U.S. government is working diligently to protect American lives and property and hopes that the nation will also take appropriate precautions to avoid various dangers. It is reported that before issuing this statement, the Secretary of State stated while hosting journalists that, as far as is known, no unusually serious incidents have occurred regarding the British interception of American ships and removal of contraband. One American ship detained by the British has already been released, and other detained ships will also be released in due course. (Reuters, 14th)

Washington D.C. Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to the press on the issue of neutrality, saying, "I wrote to Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, on May 27th of this year, informing them that although the U.S. government has taken various restrictive measures on its own through domestic legislation, it has never abandoned the rights of neutral countries as stipulated by international law. "The various principles concerning neutral and belligerent countries contained in international law have been established for a long time. Although belligerent countries violate these principles under various pretexts, international law still exists without any doubt. The U.S. government, adhering to these principles, will naturally reserve all rights granted to it, and if it is violated by any belligerent country in the future, the U.S. government must take more practical and prudent measures to deal with it." (Havas, 14th)

Washington D.C. Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison declared today, "The safest thing for the American people is to travel on American ships. American ships will have very prominent markings in the future and will sail along fixed routes, but without naval escorts. If Germany or others want to risk attacking, it will be a great risk. We also believe they will not do so." (Associated Press, 15th)

Washington D.C. Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison recently told the press that the U.S. Navy fleet patrolled the Atlantic coast, extending 200 miles north and south, and found no submarines. White House Secretary Early said that President Roosevelt's decision to convene Congress on September 21 was due to the activities of a certain country's submarines and the sinking of the British liner "Athenia." (Havas, 14th)

London. According to reports here last night, 5,900 tons of contraband phosphorus carried by the American ship "Warrior" have been confiscated by the British government. The British government had previously notified ships of neutral countries that any goods bound for Germany should be inspected first. British intelligence said that the 5,900 tons of phosphorus were originally destined for Hamburg. The ship arrived in the UK on September 2nd to unload. Several other ships have been "invited" to British ports for inspection. The American ship "Black Osprey" was inspected on September 6th and has now been released without any confiscation of cargo. (Associated Press, 15th)

### British Air and Naval Forces Conduct Large-Scale Search of the Seas, Destroying Multiple German Submarines; British Merchant Ship Sunk Again

London. The Information Department announced that British destroyers, patrol vessels, and aircraft are now engaged in searching for German submarines over a vast area and have launched multiple decisive attacks, destroying multiple enemy submarines. Many of those in the submarines have been rescued as much as possible and immediately taken prisoner. (Reuters, 15th)

New York. According to reports from the American mail ship President Roosevelt, the British ship Vancouver City (4,950 tons) was bombarded by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean today. All of its crew members were completely rescued by a Dutch oil tanker and an aircraft. It is widely believed that the Vancouver City was bombarded near the English Channel, south of Ireland. (Reuters, 14th)

New York. According to wireless messages received here, the National Petroleum tanker "British Influence" was sunk by a torpedo 300 miles off the coast of Ireland. Several crew members have been rescued by the Norwegian cargo ship "Idabaelk." (Havas, 14th)

New York. The Federal Steamship Company announced today that it received a wireless message from the American ship "Manhattan" stating that the Norwegian ship "Aida" had rescued the personnel of the British ship "Inverness." Details are unknown. (Associated Press, 15th)

London. The British ship Farleigh was sunk by a German submarine today. According to the ship's chief mate, after the ship was torpedoed, the submarine commander issued a distress call, stating the location where the ship was sunk. The crew members were in lifeboats for thirteen hours before being rescued. (Reuters, 15th)

London. According to official documents, the British contraband policy has been effective, and a large number of contraband items have been intercepted, unable to be transported to Germany. German propaganda is now resorting to threats against neutral countries, openly declaring to neutral countries what Germany considers neutral behavior and what it does not. The German side issued wireless accusations that the purpose of the British contraband policy is to exploit neutral trade and starve the elderly, weak, women, and children of neutral countries to death. In fact, Britain does not want to dictate to any neutral country and has clearly stated that it is willing to facilitate legitimate trade of neutral countries to the best of its ability. British policy has no desire to harm the economies of neutral countries, but it is eager to maintain its most friendly relations. Britain has never wanted to prevent ordinary food and other items from being imported into neutral countries for their own consumption. What Britain wants to do is only to prevent the German government from obtaining foreign food and raw materials, which would prolong the war. For this reason, the government issued a proclamation on September 3, designating certain goods as contraband, the main purpose of which is similar to the notice issued by the U.S. government during the Great War. The purpose of the British contraband system is to prevent contraband from being directly transported into Germany or transported into Germany through neutral countries. Neutral public opinion will be able to judge for itself where the threat to its neutrality comes from, whether it is our publicly announced contraband policy from the British and French side, or the submarine warfare and conspiracies of Germany. (Reuters, 15th)

### Germany Hopes All Countries Will Strictly Adhere to Neutrality

Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the "German Foreign Policy Communications Report," published an article today examining the neutrality of various countries, stating that Germany believes that countries not only have the right to maintain neutrality and stay out of the matter, but also should do their best to avoid being affected by the war. However, the British view seems to be completely different, fearing that countries will not join the war, and at the same time forcing neutral countries to wage economic war against Germany together with Britain. The fact that the war has not expanded to the Mediterranean has shattered Britain's plan to involve Southeast European countries in the war, because Romania considers Britain's guarantees unnecessary, and the Turkish Prime Minister also stated that there is no reason to participate in the war. Germany deeply hopes that countries will continue this opportunity, concentrate their efforts on seeking internal development, and not be trapped in difficulties and troubles due to problems that have nothing to do with them. Germany solemnly reiterates here that it is willing to maintain the most harmonious diplomatic relations with this group of countries. (Haitong, 15th)

Bern, Switzerland. According to sources here, regarding the impact of British blockade measures on the Swiss watch industry, the Swiss government sent a note to London yesterday to protest. It is reported that the Swiss government regards watches as the most important industry in Switzerland and attaches great importance to it. (Haitong, 15th)

The "National Daily" in Basel published an article examining the impact of economic warfare on Switzerland's foreign trade. The report pointed out that the blockade of the Swiss border cannot be stopped, and that part of the economic war will take place within the Swiss border. The report believes that Germany's damage to Swiss commerce will be minimal, because Germany must increase exports to exchange for foreign exchange, but it goes without saying that German exports are limited to non-military and items necessary to maintain civil food supply. The report went on to say that German officials are closely watching various export possibilities.

Oslo, Norway. Norwegian industry is greatly affected by the inconvenience caused by the Central Kingdom's blockade plan. Many fake ivory factories and paper mills are about to close down, with factories reducing workers daily. (Haitong, 15th)

Copenhagen, Denmark. Well-informed sources here officially stated that after Germany announced the contraband regulations, Germany's views on Denmark's essential economic needs will not change. All parties believe that normal commerce between Denmark and other countries will be able to continue. Danish sources also mentioned Germany's guarantee of the normal export of Danish agricultural products, which was recently provided by German special envoy Haisaner. (Haitong, 15th)

Buenos Aires, Argentina. According to news from the Paraguayan capital, the Paraguayan government has issued an order to strictly maintain neutrality regarding the European war. (Havas, 14th)

Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Navy Department recently instructed the national fleet to strictly defend the coasts of the home country, "to maintain a neutral position and prevent the belligerent countries from establishing any base on our coast." It is reported that the British government recently notified the governments of Central and South American countries not to allow Germany to establish submarine bases on their coasts, so as not to undermine neutrality. (Havas, 14th)

### American Newspapers Praise the Combat Effectiveness of the British, French, and Polish Armies

Rome. The Roman Observer reported that the German army's actions in Poland are now encountering increasingly greater obstacles. The recent rain has hindered the movement of troops, and secondary roads everywhere have become almost impassable, especially for heavy artillery and motorized units. The defense of Warsaw will be one of the most glorious pages in the history of warfare, truly woven of courage, military strategy, and patriotism. (Reuters, 15th)

Rome. A correspondent for the local La Verità Fascista newspaper in Paris praised the combat effectiveness of the French army, saying that the French army's advance has made Saarbrücken feel a serious threat. Several German aircraft in the area have been shot down by the French. The report also expressed admiration for the British Expeditionary Force. (Reuters, 15th)

### New York Exchange Market in Disorder; Pound Sterling Falls to New Low

New York. Today's exchange rate market in New York was very chaotic, because the selling pressure on the pound sterling was very strong from both here and abroad, but the British Equalization Fund still turned a blind eye, causing the pound sterling to fall to a new low. The exchange rate of the pound sterling fell straight down, reaching today's low of $3.76 at noon before stopping. After that, it recovered slightly, closing at $3.90, down 9.875 points from yesterday's close, but the sentiment was still very chaotic. The currencies of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and other countries did not change much, because they have broken away from their link with the pound sterling. The French franc also fell sharply, closing at 2.22, compared to yesterday's close of 2.29. This trend is not surprising, because the attackers of the French franc are the pound sterling, not the U.S. dollar. The German gold mark, which has not had a market price since September 2, reappeared on the market today, and its price has not changed from before. According to merchants, there were only sellers in the market today, so there were very few transactions. In addition, according to the Foreign Exchange Committee, American demand for U.S. dollars, such as that related to clearing all pre-war pound sterling balances in the U.S. or related to clearing current commerce with the British Empire, can be settled in London at a price of $4.02. (Reuters, 14th)

### Soviet Troops Massed on Borders; Delicate German-Soviet-Polish Relations; Rumor of German-Soviet Agreement to Establish New Poland as Buffer Zone Between Two Countries

Bern, Switzerland. The Swiss Telegraph Agency recently reported that, according to private sources in Moscow, the Soviet government has mobilized several levels of reserve troops, purely as a precautionary measure, and not to participate in the war between Germany and Poland. Stalin has no intention of changing the current policy of peace and neutrality. In addition, the Soviet government's official newspaper Izvestia also reported that the Soviet Union has no intention of participating in the war, but will only pay attention to the development of the war. (Havas, 15th)

London. Soviet sources here today denied that the Soviet Union has any intention of partitioning any part of Poland. Diplomatic circles here also said that the Soviet Union's current attitude should not be regarded as clear evidence that it is unfavorable to Poland. (Associated Press, 15th)

Paris. The Soviet government has mobilized reserve troops for enlistment in recent days, totaling as many as 2 million. According to the Soviet official explanation, after the German army continued to advance in Poland, the war front line is getting closer and closer to the Soviet border, and it is necessary to prepare for it in advance. Some people in France, in view of the fact that the Soviet newspaper Izvestia once referred to Führer Hitler as an aggressor, also believe that the Soviet mobilization is to warn Germany. However, diplomatic figures believe that the Soviet attitude is ambiguous. The country's newspapers raised the issue of the status of the Ukrainian and Little Russian minority groups in Poland today. This kind of omen is similar to the methods used by Germany to deal with Austria and Czechoslovakia before annexing Austria and reclaiming the Sudetenland. In addition, news from Moscow pointed out that Polish aircraft repeatedly violated Soviet airspace, and the German side also exaggerated and published it. All of this is noteworthy, but in the current war, a certain country in Europe is quietly watching the Soviet attitude. Among them, Romania signed a treaty of alliance with Poland to prevent the Soviet Union. If one of the Baltic countries is invaded by the Soviet Union, the other country has an obligation to provide assistance. (Havas, 14th)

Berlin. According to informed sources today, Germany has agreed to establish a new Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union, as a buffer zone between Germany and the Soviet Union, after destroying Polish resistance. The area under the jurisdiction of the new Poland can roughly guarantee one-third to one-half of the current Polish territory, and Krakow in the south can also be included in its territory. According to news here, Soviet military envoys made practical discussions on the scope of German military actions in Poland at this time. Many Germans here expect that the Soviet Union will take military action against Poland within a few days. Germany seems to have abandoned Warsaw and expects that Lithuania will also demand to take the northeast of Poland, that is, the area around Vilnius, as its own. What is most noteworthy is that Soviet plenipotentiary military consultant Fuka Jev has repeatedly consulted with the German military authorities in the past few days. According to reliable sources in the National Socialist Party, the Soviet government and the German government are constantly in contact. The newspapers here also recognize the possibility of Soviet intervention in Poland. (Associated Press, 15th)

Moscow. The official newspaper "Truth" of the Moscow Komsomol considered the possibility of the Ukrainian region of Poland becoming a Soviet protectorate yesterday, claiming that Poland exploited the Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities. The editorial of the newspaper commented that Poland's exploitation of the Belarusian minority was one of the main reasons for the defeat of the Polish army. The editorial believes that it is very likely that the Soviet Union will support the establishment of several Ukrainian and Belarusian republics. The newspaper went on to say that the establishment of the republic depends entirely on the will of the people. After its establishment, they can join the Soviet Union as an autonomous republic. (Associated Press, 15th)

Beijing. The Soviet Communist Party's organ, Pravda, made its first remarks yesterday on the issue of ethnic minorities within Poland. This question has caused great interest among German politicians, who are commenting on it. German Foreign Ministry officials said that although Germany and the Soviet Union have exchanged opinions since signing the non-aggression treaty, they have not discussed the Ukrainian issue so far. (Havas, 15th)

Moscow. Polish officials here today strongly refuted the alarming rumor that the Polish ambassador to the Soviet Union was preparing to leave Moscow, stating that the Polish ambassador did not ask the Soviet government for an exit passport. Polish people in Moscow do not express concern about the Soviet Communist Party's mouthpiece "Pravda" attacking Poland and accusing it of oppressing 11 million Russian residents in Poland. Outsiders may point to "Pravda's" remarks as a sign of the Soviet Union's attention to the fate of the Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities in Poland, but Polish people here do not recognize this statement as true. In the article attacking Poland, "Pravda" said that Polish officials have done their best to oppress these minorities, causing their mutual relations to reach a state of extreme tension. The report analyzes the reasons for Poland's failure, saying that there are inexplicable reasons, not only because of Germany's superiority in strategy and equipment, and the lack of effective assistance from Britain and France. Various reports on the Polish situation indicate that the Polish national institutions are becoming increasingly disorganized and chaotic. The internal disintegration occurred as soon as the military defeat was suffered, and the incompetence and inefficiency of its institutions can be seen. The Polish people only account for one-sixth of the national population, and the rest include 8 million Ukrainians and 3 million Belarusians. If they have no administrative autonomy or schools suitable for their national character, it is impossible to maintain this ethnically complex country and its internal unity without this right. (Reuters, 15th)

London. All the morning newspapers here are closely watching the Soviet attitude. Diplomatic problem reporters, in view of the fact that the country's government is carrying out mobilization and the country's newspapers are fiercely criticizing Poland, have said that the time for the country to participate in the war and divide Poland with Germany is approaching. The diplomatic problem reporter of the Manchester Guardian said, "Once Warsaw falls, the Soviet government may join Germany in "caring" about the Polish situation. The so-called "caring" is nothing more than planning to acquire the eastern cities of Poland, that is, the areas where Russians and Ukrainians live together. There is no doubt that Germany and the Soviet Union are colluding to divide Poland." The diplomatic problem reporter of the News Chronicle said, "If the Soviet Union abandons its policy of neutrality, then the price paid by Germany will be to sacrifice the independent sovereignty of the Baltic coastal countries. Then the Soviet government, which has always condemned acts of aggression more vehemently than any country in Europe, will see its footsteps follow Germany. According to what is generally known, the plan of the Soviet Union is to occupy the capital of Latvia and annex the country, while placing Lithuania under the protection of Germany and the Soviet Union." (Havas, 15th)

### Soviet Union Actively Preparing for War, Continuing to Recruit New Soldiers, Numbering Up to One Million

Moscow. According to the military laws passed today, conscription has continued. According to unofficial estimates, the number of people recruited is one million. Pravda insists that the Soviet Union should make full military preparations because the capitalist world has been infected with war mania. (Reuters, 15th)

Moscow. Three trains recently departed from Leningrad today and the remaining trains, including the "Red Arrow Express," were suspended. In addition, trains from Moscow to Negoreloe on the Polish border have also been suspended. In addition, suburban short-distance trains from Leningrad, Kiev, and Hajatte have also reduced the number of trips. (Havas, 15th)

### Germany Actively Building Ships

Danzig. According to the political correspondent in Berlin, German shipyards are now working day and night to increase the number of warships, not only building submarines but also building surface ships. Germany is trying to fight against the British blockade and intends to sink merchant ships indiscriminately to inflict a fatal blow on British shipping. (Reuters, 15th)

### Italian Developments Attract Worldwide Attention: Hopes for Italian-Soviet Mediation

Rome: Various developments in Italy have been commented upon by foreign observers here. Some say Italy intends to side with Germany, while others believe Italy will strictly maintain neutrality. There are signs supporting both views, and they are equally strong, making it difficult to determine which prevails. Fair-minded Italian newspapers simultaneously publish war reports from both sides without drawing conclusions. Newspapers and radio stations have ceased criticizing France. Relations between France and Italy have greatly improved, and diplomatic ties have returned to normal. Moreover, Italy is currently developing Abyssinia and preparing for the 1942 World's Fair (to be held in Rome), all of which demonstrates Italy's intention to remain neutral. However, on the other hand, it is also a fact that the Italian government is cooperating with Germany. Italian newspapers are promoting pro-German and anti-British propaganda, and the Italian government is intensifying military preparations. Many key Italian figures are publicly stating that the alliance between Germany and Italy remains strong. Therefore, it is currently difficult to ascertain the true intentions of the Italian government and will remain so until Italy takes new political actions, at which point it will become easier to discern. (Havas, 14th)

The Hague: News recently received from Germany indicates that German authorities are attempting to persuade their own people and neutral countries that peace can be restored after the German army defeats Poland. The Rotterdam News published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that German officials have informed the public that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, are in Paris negotiating with the French government. The intention behind this propaganda is obvious. Generally, German political figures still hope that either Italy or the Soviet Union, or both together, will come forward to mediate, and they believe this is possible. They say that Chancellor Hitler still has two "time bombs," meaning that Mussolini and Stalin can still come forward in time to mediate and limit the scope of the war to prevent its expansion. In addition, Germany is using both inducements and threats towards neutral countries, offering to continue supplying coal and machinery, hoping to prompt these countries to oppose the British blockade policy. However, it is likely that these methods will ultimately be futile. (Havas, 15th)

Danzig: According to news from Germany today, the Germans realize that there is no hope for an early peace. They now long for a swift end to the fighting in Poland so that they can shift their full combat power to the Western Front. Germans admit that the situation there is critical. Food restrictions in Germany are reportedly becoming more severe, and even the daily rations for dogs and cats have been reduced. (Reuters, 15th)

### Italian Newspaper Article Sowing Discord Between Britain and France

Rome: Italian newspapers today published articles commenting on British Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent speech in the House of Commons. They believe that Chamberlain's speech revealed Britain's true purpose in allying with France to fight Germany: it is not really to help Poland, but to completely destroy National Socialist Germany. In recent years, Britain has been actively expanding its military and engaging in diplomatic activities everywhere, with the sole purpose of preparing for war against Germany. Therefore, if France accepts this view, wouldn't it be duped by Britain? Currently, France does not seem very enthusiastic, and French forces are not very active on the Siegfried Line. But if France does not act cautiously in time, it will be implicated by Britain. Britain wants to fight, and France will be its sacrifice. (Haitong, 15th)

### Residents of the Vatican Not Planning to Evacuate

Vatican City: According to the Vatican News Agency, although the Vatican is preparing to implement a blackout, it is not considering evacuating residents. The nature of the Vatican and its inviolability are sufficient to guarantee that it will not be subjected to air raids. Such an air raid would not only be a blatant violation of international law but also an attack on the Pope's residence. The blackout is not a defensive measure, but merely an expression of neutrality, as no areas within the city of Rome can be allowed to remain lit, as that would assist the enemy. (Haitong, 15th)

### Hungary Maintains Good Neighbor Policy, Expresses Limitless Sympathy for Poland's Heroic Resistance, New Trade Agreement Established Between Romania and Hungary

Budapest: Foreign Minister Csaky recently delivered a speech to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Lower House, stating that the current war originated from the Treaty of Versailles. As for Hungary, it maintains friendly relations with Yugoslavia and has not encountered any threats. Therefore, the government believes that it is not necessary to declare neutrality, because such a decision would inevitably prolong the war and only create complications in national life. However, Hungary is determined to defend its vital interests and will fight to the last man if necessary. The Foreign Minister also responded to a question from a certain member of parliament, saying, "The Polish people's heroic and arduous struggle is recognized even by their enemies, and our nation also has unlimited sympathy for them." (Havas, 14th)

Budapest: After the expiration of the trade agreement between Hungary and Romania in March of this year, the two sides signed a new agreement today for a term of ten years. (Havas, 14th)

### Australian Commonwealth Organizes Wartime Cabinet, Recruits 20,000 Volunteers to Go Overseas to Fight

Canberra: The members of the Australian wartime cabinet were announced today by Prime Minister Menzies as follows: Attorney-General and Minister for Industry House, Minister for Supply and Development Casey, Minister for Defense Street, Minister for External Affairs Gullett, and Minister for Commerce McLeay. (Reuters, 15th)

Canberra: The Australian cabinet has decided to immediately recruit the first batch of 20,000 volunteers to go overseas to fight and will increase the current defense program from £33 million to £45 million. (Reuters, 15th)

Canberra: Australian Commonwealth Prime Minister Menzies declared today that our current preparations are far better than when we joined the war in 1914. We have more people under military training, and their equipment is superior to what it was in the past. Our arms production has greatly increased, and our organization is more complete. Eight cabinet members served in the last war. We are very confident of victory. We feel that the Australian people are united in everything, and we are prepared to carry it through to the end. (Reuters, 15th)

### Despite Being Abandoned, Japan Still Cannot Shake Its Feelings for Germany, German Ambassador Remains in Tokyo

Tokyo: Several newspapers here today carried news that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, due to the new situation arising from the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, wanted to readjust German-Japanese relations and therefore recalled German Ambassador to Japan General Ott on September 13. However, according to the "Nichinichi Shimbun," the German Embassy here has denied the report of the ambassador's recall. According to the "Hochi Shimbun," General Ott insists that although Germany and the Soviet Union have signed a non-aggression treaty, the German-Japanese axis remains strong. The announcement of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty on August 23 greatly shocked Japan and gave the impression that Germany had betrayed Japan, because Japan had previously had unwavering faith in the strength of the Berlin-Tokyo axis. Given this situation, the Minseito party is seizing the opportunity to propagate domestically that German-Japanese relations are very strained. However, reliable sources say that the German Ambassador to Japan has urged the German government to prove to the world that the so-called tension in German-Japanese relations is merely British and French propaganda and that although Germany and the Soviet Union have a treaty, the German-Japanese axis remains strong. Regarding the axis, General Ott suggested to the German government that Germany should make the Soviet Union abandon its aid to General Chiang Kai-shek, so as to prove to Japan that the German-Soviet treaty does not hinder the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, thereby providing a concrete form. (Reuters, 15th)

### Terauchi, Osumi, and Entourage Leave Italy and Return Home Disappointed

Rome: The Japanese military inspection group, led by former Army Minister General Terauchi and former Navy Minister Admiral Osumi, has been here for many days. They are scheduled to depart from the port of Naples on the 16th aboard the NYK Line Hakone Maru, taking a route via London and New York back to Japan, and plan to stay in London for several days. In addition, Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Oshima, who came here recently and met with Prime Minister Mussolini, is scheduled to return to Berlin tomorrow. (Note: General Terauchi, Admiral Osumi, and their entourage originally planned to go to Nuremberg, Germany, to attend the Nazi Party Congress.) (Havas, 14th)

### Poland Refuses Exchange of Prisoners

Berlin: According to an official announcement here, the German Foreign Ministry yesterday proposed to the Swedish Legation, which represents Polish interests in Germany, that it convey to the Polish government the idea of exchanging German nationals detained in the Polish interior with Polish prisoners held by the German army. The Swedish Legation notified the German Foreign Ministry yesterday that Poland refused to consider this proposal. (Haitong, 15th)

### Göring Inspects and Returns to Berlin, Meets with Hitler

Berlin: Air Minister General Göring, after returning from an inspection of the front lines, met with Chancellor Hitler yesterday to present a report. He also inspected major factories in the Polish Upper Silesia Province in his capacity as dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan. (Havas, 15th)

### Neutral Countries to Represent German Interests Abroad

Berlin: According to an official communiqué released here yesterday, "German interests in Poland, Morocco, Tangier, and the Union of South Africa are to be taken care of by the Netherlands. In France and French territories (excluding Morocco and Tangier) and Egypt, German interests are to be taken care of by Sweden. In England and the British Empire (excluding the Union of South Africa), German interests are to be taken care of by Switzerland. In Iraq, German interests are to be taken care of by Iran. On the other hand, Polish and South African interests in Germany are to be taken care of by Sweden. British and French interests are to be taken care of by the United States. Egyptian interests are to be taken care of by Iran, and Iraqi interests are to be taken care of by Afghanistan." (Haitong, 15th)

### German Naval Aircraft Lands in Dutch Waters, Impounded

The Hague: A German naval aircraft that was forced to land yesterday near Ameland in Dutch territorial waters, whose crew claimed to have engaged in combat with British aircraft over the Heligoland Bight and been pursued by the British aircraft, has been impounded by the Netherlands in accordance with neutrality regulations, along with its crew. (Reuters, 15th)

### Britain Regulates Food Supply and Prevents Price Manipulation by Unscrupulous Merchants

Amsterdam: According to reports from London carried in local newspapers, Britain will issue 80 million food rationing cards. It is reported that the cards have already been printed and will be distributed after the registration of the population is completed. It is expected that the registration process can be completed by the 12th, and the distribution of registration cards will take ten days. The government plans to begin distributing rationing cards after British residents (including foreigners) receive identity cards. At the same time, British authorities will set maximum price limits to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and manipulating prices. It is reported that the rationing cards currently being issued are only related to five categories of major food items: first, cheese and artificial cheese; second, sugar; third, fresh meat; fourth, sausages and ham; and fifth, various fats and oils. The amount of food that children under the age of six are entitled to enjoy is half of that of adults. (Haitong, 15th)

### Former Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg Chooses Death Over Treason, Refuses to Force Austrians to Fight, Executed by the Germans

Paris: According to the "French Daily," former Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg has been detained by the Germans since Austria was annexed. Because he refused to sign a document urging Austrians to fight for Germany, he was executed by firing squad. Schuschnigg was the son of a general, born in 1897, and participated in the Great War, serving as a lieutenant in a heavy artillery unit, receiving numerous commendations. Near the end of the Great War, he was captured by Italian forces. He returned to Austria in 1919 and practiced law. After Dollfuss was assassinated, he took over as Chancellor, using his ability and calm to try to curb the rise of the Nazi Party. However, after Berlin issued the "March Demands" in February 1938, Schuschnigg was forced to resign and was succeeded as Chancellor by Austrian Nazi leader Inquiet, who requested Germany to send troops to help maintain order. Thus, 50,000 fully armed and mechanized German troops crossed the border into Austria. On March 13 of that year, Germany officially annexed Austrian territory. Austrian President Miklas was ousted, and Schuschnigg was arrested. (Reuters, 15th)

### A Week's War Situation

(Continued from yesterday)

Hunan-Jiangxi Area: Chinese forces in northern Hunan attacked Gaobanqiao east of Linxiang on the morning of the 6th, engaging in intense fighting with Japanese forces for half a day, and recaptured the area, killing more than a hundred Japanese troops. In the Junshan area, Japanese warships have recently become active again. On the 7th, three Japanese warships and numerous speedboats sailed from Yueyang to the vicinity of Junshan, attempting to harass the area, but were fiercely repulsed by Chinese forces. The Japanese warships and speedboats were badly damaged. When they sailed to Zhanggongdu in the north, they were continuously shelled by Chinese forces, and the Japanese suffered more than 700 casualties. The Japanese troops were terrified and disturbed each other. The Japanese troops near Ruichang were subjected to continuous attacks by Chinese forces, and all strongholds on the outskirts of the city were recaptured by Chinese forces. More than 150 Japanese troops were killed at Majiazhuang. Ruichang is under Chinese control. In addition, Chinese artillery southwest of Fengxin launched a fierce attack on the vicinity of Kutouzhen. At the same time, several groups of Japanese infantry advanced towards the Chinese side but were repulsed by Chinese forces after a calm response, killing more than 200 Japanese troops. On the evening of the 8th, Chinese forces launched a major attack on the Japanese troops in Guangyi, advancing to the outskirts of the city and engaging in intense fighting with Japanese troops for several hours, killing many Japanese troops. The remaining troops retreated into the city and held it. Chinese forces are currently launching a fierce attack.

Fujian-Guangdong Area: After Pingtan Island in southern Fujian was invaded by Japanese troops, brave Chinese officers and soldiers crossed the sea to attack on the evening of the 5th. After a night of intense fighting, they captured the county seat of Pingtan. The remnants of the Japanese army were then swept away by Chinese forces. Apart from a unit that escaped onto Japanese warships, all the rest were annihilated. In eastern Guangdong, Chinese forces launched attacks on Chaoan, Anbu, and other places for days, with extremely fierce offensives. They once broke into Chaoan City, annihilating countless Japanese troops. Although the Japanese troops on Zhuganshan repeatedly reinforced their counterattacks, they were all crushed. More than 100 Japanese troops near Fengxi Railway Station were completely annihilated on the 5th. Chaoan is currently tightly surrounded by Chinese forces, and the Japanese troops have repeatedly attempted to break out but failed. Chinese forces are currently launching a fierce attack. Anbu was recaptured by Chinese forces on the evening of the 8th. As for the Japanese troops in Zengcong, they had mobilized more than 5,000 troops last week and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese side. For a time, the Japanese were very sharp and captured Guancun in Conghua. Chinese forces rose up in counterattack and fought bloody battles for a week, blunting the Japanese momentum and recapturing Fuhua Xu, Guancun, and various strongholds, killing seven or eight hundred Japanese troops. On the 9th, they formally recaptured Conghua County. The Japanese troops fled in disarray. The Japanese troops in Huaxian were once restless and sneaked to Weiganshi and Yangtouxu but were met with a head-on blow. The Japanese troops collapsed and retreated. Chinese forces took advantage of the victory to advance and once entered Huaxian on the evening of the 10th, killing many Japanese troops. They are still engaged in intense fighting in the northern suburbs. In addition, the Japanese troops in Jiangcun and Hepu have been attacked repeatedly, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops in Jiangmen and Xinhui have been harassing Da Xiaomeishan repeatedly in the past week, but have not succeeded. In recent days, our army has taken advantage of the victory to launch fierce attacks, and Sanjiang and Longlai were recaptured on the 6th. In addition, the Japanese troops who landed in Hengmen have been making efforts to advance southwards along two routes, but they were ambushed near Yanzhou, suffering heavy casualties. A unit of them is still entrenched near Licun and has been surrounded by us on three sides. In addition, the Suiyuan army routed the Japanese troops advancing from Da Shuwan, killing more than 300. The Chinese forces besieging Totok County occupied Hekouzhen and then fiercely attacked the city with artillery, which was very successful. In Hebei province, we attacked Beiping, recaptured Shidaocun west of Mentougou, and broke into Longhuamen in the east of the city, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese troops. Another Chinese army encircled and annihilated the Japanese army at Kaibizhen southwest of Shijiazhuang, capturing many. In Shandong, we recaptured the county seats of Pingyin and Muping. In southern Anhui, we recaptured Laian and broke into Quanjiao. In the Jiangnan counterattack, we captured Gaochun and recaptured the strongholds of Gucheng and Liqiao on the outskirts of the city. These are all important achievements in the past week. (14th)

### Japanese Aircraft Raid Ningxia

Lanzhou: Twenty-eight Japanese aircraft, on the morning of the 15th at 10:50 AM, invaded Ningxia airspace via northern Shaanxi and dropped more than 40 bombs in the urban area, destroying more than a hundred houses and killing or wounding more than 30 civilians. After dropping the bombs, the Japanese aircraft flew south, appearing to be attacking Lanzhou.

Intense fighting broke out immediately. Until 1 AM, a unit of Japanese troops returned to their ships, while another unit continued to fight. After a brave charge by Chinese forces, the remaining Japanese troops were completely repulsed at 1 PM on the 13th. In this battle, the Japanese suffered many casualties. (14th)

### Mobile Medical Service Teams Expand Operations

Chongqing: According to Mr. Lin, who is currently in charge of the mobile medical service teams in the rear areas, these teams numbered only 37 last year. By June of this year, they had increased to 76 teams. There is still potential for further expansion, aided by generous donations from foreigners sympathetic to China and overseas Chinese. The Red Cross Society has received donations in this regard totaling no less than two million yuan, most of which is for ten ambulance trucks and medical equipment worth 300,000 yuan. The Red Cross now has a total of 197 trucks and ambulances, 158 doctors, 359 nurses, and 846 assistants, serving everywhere from the rear of the Chinese army along the coast to the remote northwest.

### Sino-Soviet Cultural Association Welcomes Soviet Ambassador - Vice Chairman Feng Delivers Speech at Reception, Saying Soviet-Japanese Compromise is Impossible

Chongqing: The Sino-Soviet Cultural Association held a tea party at 3:00 PM on the fifteenth to welcome the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to China, Pan Youxin.

Ambassador Pan, accompanied by Embassy Counselor Xie Weinai, Secretary Ma Qiushen, Military Attaché Ivan Sifu, etc., arrived amidst music and applause. Shao Lizi, the acting president, delivered a welcoming speech, expressing great emotion for Ambassador Pan's address when presenting his credentials, hoping that with Ambassador Pan's enthusiastic support, the association would promote the political, economic, and cultural development between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. Ambassador Pan responded, expressing admiration for China's ability to vigorously maintain education and cultural endeavors even during wartime, hoping that China and the Soviet Union would frequently hold various exhibitions to facilitate cultural exchange. Tea and refreshments were then served, followed by a speech by Vice Chairman Feng, who stated that the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association's welcome to the ambassador was truly a heartfelt expression. He also said that the Japanese were taking advantage of the European situation to sow discord between China and the Soviet Union, while villains were spreading rumors that the Soviet Union and Japan were negotiating agreements. Based on the close ties between China and the Soviet Union and the latest reports, we firmly believe that such rumors are completely unfounded. (Fifteenth)

Chongqing: The Sino-Soviet Cultural Association welcomed the new Soviet Ambassador to China, Pan Youxin, this afternoon. During the reception, Feng Yuxiang delivered a welcoming speech, briefly stating that according to information directly obtained by the Chinese government, there is indeed no possibility of a compromise between the Soviet Union and Japan. According to Feng, the Supreme National Defense Council, currently in session, had thoroughly studied two long telegrams sent by Sun Ke, the Chinese envoy to the Soviet Union. According to Sun Ke's telegrams, after these rumors arose, he immediately held detailed discussions with the Soviet authorities. As a result, all the leaders of the Kremlin firmly denied these rumors, and all the leaders solemnly declared to him that the Soviet Union had no intention of compromising with Japan. Finally, they also stated that in the process of China continuing its resistance against Japan, the Soviet Union was determined to provide spiritual and material assistance to China. According to the Soviet leaders, those who spread and exaggerated these rumors were likely "elements who do not want China to defeat Japan." The new Soviet ambassador's response focused on how to promote friendly relations, cultural relations, and closer contact between the two countries. (Fifteenth, Associated Press)

### U.S. Congress Convenes Soon to Discuss Neutrality Act - Isolationists Still Trying to Obstruct

Washington: According to President Roosevelt, he told reporters that he had considered the issue of German submarine activity before convening the special session of Congress, and 311 of the passengers on the British merchant ship "Athenia" that was sunk were American citizens. Since the special session of Congress is scheduled to be held on September 21, Washington, D.C. is currently in a state of emergency. The U.S. government authorities can generally proceed smoothly with revising the Neutrality Act in this tense atmosphere. If the law can be successfully amended, the British and French authorities will benefit first, as they can purchase arms with cash, because their navies have already controlled maritime traffic. President's Secretary O'Leary told reporters last night that the President had gauged the intentions of general members of Congress before convening Congress, so it can be inferred from his words that the issue of amending the Neutrality Act should not cause further complications. According to Democratic Senator Thomas, the isolationists in Congress seem to have lost their support, so the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will definitely pass the amendment to the Neutrality Act.

But if we tear up the current Neutrality Act, which is supported by the whole country, then I dare say that we will soon be involved in the whirlpool of war, and our youth will have to be sent to the battlefields of Europe again.

It is rumored that the team of aircraft will be transferred to Manila, but naval sources here believe that this is inaccurate and unfounded. It is heard that fourteen bombers from Hawaii flew to Manila last week, so the purpose of the planes from San Diego coming here is purely for replenishment. However, naval officers are unwilling to explain this. (Fifteenth, Associated Press)

### British Intelligence Work Subject to Domestic Criticism - Authorities Explain to Parliament

London: Sir Macmillan, Minister of Information, recently declared in the House of Lords, "The intention of the government in establishing the Ministry of Information is to faithfully report to the people of our country and other countries what we are planning, doing, and hoping for. Therefore, I believe that rather than publishing a large amount of unreliable information, it is better to issue less information and strive for accuracy and credibility. I firmly believe that if this policy is implemented for a long time, foreign newspapers will feel that what we publish is limited to confirmed news and official formal statements. In addition, the Ministry of Information has agreed with the Army Department that in the future, every week, the Army Department will send senior military officers to report various confidential news to responsible representatives of various newspapers. At the same time, the Navy and Air Force will also send personnel to the press to make speeches when necessary." Macmillan also said that although the amount of information issued by the German side is large, it is rarely effective. The reason for this is that most of the enemy's news is fabricated.

### War on Southeast Pudong - Misunderstanding Among Guerrilla Units - Japanese and Puppet Troops Attempt to Attack

News from Southern Pudong: All parts of Southeastern Pudong are defended by the National Salvation Army. Southern Sichuan is commanded by Yu Taosheng of the Third Detachment. The area bordering Nanhui and Fengxian was originally under the command of Li Zhiming of the Second Detachment. Li resigned and left this spring, and Gu Shouxin, the commander of the First Battalion of the Second Detachment, was transferred to take his place. The western part of Fengxian and the area of Southern Songjiang are under the jurisdiction of Ding Xisan of the Eighth Detachment. Recently, a small number of soldiers from the Second and Eighth Detachments had a sudden conflict due to a misunderstanding. By the time their superiors heard about it and tried to stop it, it was already too late, and the two sides actually came into contact near Qingcun Port and held each other for two days. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Japanese and puppet troops dispatched teams from Nanqiao on the tenth and attacked in three directions. The two detachments were caught off guard and almost suffered a complete defeat. Fortunately, Ding Xisan, commander of the Eighth Detachment, received the news earlier and immediately led his troops to flank from the coastal area. A fierce battle broke out near Qicundun. The troops of the National Army also took the opportunity to rush out, and the Japanese and puppet forces retreated midway. The war was not expanded. However, it is rumored that a small number of soldiers from the two teams who do not understand the stakes still have personal grudges and fights. The commanders of both sides are currently mediating.

The Japanese and puppet troops have been paying attention to the guerrillas for a long time, and they have hired traitors with heavy profits to guide them. Pi Gusheng, commander of the Second Battalion of the Eighth Detachment, was ordered to go to Jinhui Bridge to deploy defenses. His office was located in a certain village four or five miles away from the town, which was desolate. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 PM on the thirteenth, more than 100 Japanese and puppet troops from Nanqiao went there late at night, guided by a traitor. At that time, Hua Bucheng, the patrol leader of the Jinhui Bridge guard team, was passing by on patrol, and shouted the password. In the dimness, it was vaguely indistinguishable. Just as he was about to fire, the Japanese and puppet troops preemptively fired with machine guns. Patrol Leader Hua was killed on the spot. Commander Pi heard the alarm and rushed over, and was also shot and killed. Three of his subordinates were killed or injured. The Japanese and puppet troops did not dare to advance and returned to Nanqiao.

The passengers and crew on the Da Kang steamer, which traveled from Shanghai to Jinhui Bridge in Fengxian, which had been detained by the Japanese army, were all taken by the officials to the Japanese Naval Headquarters in Beiqiao for interrogation. Each person was forced to confess under electric torture. After the local shops jointly guaranteed them, twelve people including the Wang family have been released. Four people including Qiu Xiaojun and Chen Guanxiang are suspected of being more serious and have been taken to Hongkou. It is heard that they will be handed over to the military law conference there.

### One Japanese Soldier Drifts in Hua Army in Rugao - Japanese Army Sends Team to Attack Upon Hearing News - Sets Fire to Homes When Retreating

Correspondence from Rugao: Chemahu Town, a village in the southwest of the county, is more than forty miles away from the city. The Tenth District Office is located in the town. Last autumn, it was once occupied by the Japanese army, and dozens of district offices and civilian houses were burned down. Later, He Qiyong, the leader of the First Detachment of the Rugao County People's Self-Defense Force, led his troops to repel them, and the Third Battalion of the Detachment took over the defense. Recently, the battalion commander ordered his troops to go deep into the Japanese-occupied area to capture Japanese soldiers. They had previously captured three people. On the eighth of this month, Squad Leader Wang was ordered to lead six team members, disguised as villagers, to infiltrate Xinsheng Port. That evening, they learned that two Japanese soldiers were having fun in a brothel, so they rushed in. Because the two Japanese soldiers were unclothed, it was not easy to detain them. The Hua army, in desperation, grabbed the testicles of one of the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldier struggled to escape, and the testicles were torn off, spattering blood. He escaped in pain. The other Japanese soldier was immediately captured. Before long, the Japanese army heard the news and immediately sent a team to search. However, the Hua army had already slipped away. The Japanese army gained nothing and was unwilling, so they gathered more than 100 Japanese and puppet troops and tracked them down overnight. On the morning of the ninth, they arrived in Chemahu Town and came into contact with the Hua army. For a time, bullets flew everywhere. The residents were awakened from their dreams and fled to the countryside, supporting the old and carrying the young. After a fierce battle lasting for more than an hour, the Japanese army could not hold on and retreated. In this battle, the Hua army killed two Japanese soldiers and one poor man who was killed by stray bullets. When the Japanese army fled, they set fire to the Guandi Temple and dozens of civilian houses in the town, and also set fire to more than a dozen civilian houses in Guojiayuan Town Houqiao along the way. The naked Japanese soldier captured by the Hua army has now been escorted to the detachment headquarters. The detachment headquarters will give a reward of 500 yuan to show encouragement.

### On the Eve of the Outbreak of the European War: The Evolution of the New International Situation (Continued) Shudi: Britain's Mistake in Cunning Diplomacy; A Review of the Inside Story of the Sudden Compromise Between Germany and the Soviet Union; Japan Suffers Germany's Absolute Abandonment

What's more, on the other hand, the strength of the Soviet Union is constantly and surprisingly expanding. This is an open secret today. Everyone now admits that, judging solely from the strength of the Soviet Union itself, the possibility of forming an "anti-communist crusade" is becoming increasingly remote. I just happen to have a very simple statistic that can roughly indicate the strength of the major powers. I will list it below: (1) The military expenditure of major powers in 1938: Britain was 340 million pounds, France 220 million pounds, Germany 880 million pounds, Italy 150 million pounds, Japan 350 million pounds (note: this is still a special wartime situation). The United States was 227 million pounds, but the Soviet Union was 146 million pounds. (2) In 1939, Britain was 700 million pounds, France 360 million pounds, Germany 900 million pounds, Italy 110 million pounds, Japan 360 million pounds, the United States 210 million pounds, and the Soviet Union was 18 million pounds. Statistically, the military expenditure of the Soviet Union alone is almost equal to the sum of Germany, Japan, and Italy. And this is still a budget under the "peace policy," and it can be increased several times once the war starts.

What the German General Staff fears most of the time is this huge Red Army, Navy, and Air Force!

In this situation, stubbornly believing that a buffer between Germany and the Soviet Union is impossible, and playing tricks on both sides, is obviously a dangerous and stubborn idea like playing with fire!

As a result, the buffer between Germany and the Soviet Union was facilitated.

(2) The Events Before and After the Production of the German-Soviet "Non-Aggression Pact"

Based on the background of the international situation described above, we can infer the complete possibility of a German-Soviet buffer. Here, we only need to look at the international situation before and after the production of this non-aggression treaty, and we can immediately understand that its production is actually an inevitable destination.

First of all, it must be remembered that within Germany, there has always been a powerful group advocating rapprochement with the Soviet Union. Most of the members of this group are military personnel, and the leader is General Goering. Secondly, since April of this year, as the movement to attack the Soviet Union, brewed by Chamberlain and his ilk, has intensified, a faction advocating a buffer with Germany has also emerged in the Soviet Union. The host is Stalin himself. Therefore, in April, his representative visited Berlin. Not long ago, the German Papen went to Moscow.

The entire international situation on the eve of the production of this "non-aggression treaty" can be explained in several points: (1) After the British Parliament adjourned, Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately returned to his countryside in Scotland to make the greatest efforts to compromise with Germany and intended to divide the world. The detailed situation is unknown to the outside world because it is too confidential, but it is a fact that this makes the British people panic. (2) The military negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union started smoothly, but great disputes arose when it came to the specific distribution of military power. Especially for assistance to Poland and Germany, it is said that the representatives of Britain and France insisted that Poland would not allow the Red Army to enter the country, and it was best to limit assistance to air force and military equipment. When the situation reached a considerable stage and Poland could not hold on, the Soviet Union would provide assistance with its army. In addition, Britain and France also expressed dissatisfaction with the large-scale eastward movement of the Soviet army and the concentration in Siberia. Finally, when the Soviet representative requested to inspect the military equipment of Britain and France in detail, they were refused. Originally, Britain's intention seemed to be only to jointly assist Poland, and not to establish a complete military alliance. As a result, the negotiations were immediately shelved. (2) After the Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met with Ribbentrop and Hitler, Hitler knew that Italy did not advocate using troops against Poland immediately. Therefore, Hitler's original intention was to take advantage of the fact that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union had not been completed and occupy Danzig in one fell swoop, but this plan was shelved at this time. Then, Ciano began to contact Poland, persuading it to join the side of Germany and Italy, and after solving the Danzig problem, to jointly demand colonies from Britain and France. (3) Poland's attitude was very ambiguous. On the one hand, it negotiated with Italy, and on the other hand, it sent representatives to Britain, asking to complete the alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as soon as possible, otherwise, it could not resist the pressure from Germany and Italy. (4) The Japanese military delegation was already on its way to Germany, intending to negotiate a military alliance with Germany. (5) Germany publicly stated that its future development route, after the Danzig issue was resolved, was other places, not the Ukrainian part of the Soviet Union.

Among these, Poland's skillful use of diplomacy almost put Germany in an awkward position. At this time, Hitler seemed to have only three paths to take: (1) Naturally, he would make concessions to Poland, put the Danzig issue aside, and let Poland gain the upper hand once. (2) A buffer with the Soviet Union. (3) Simply join Chamberlain's route. He was unwilling to take the first path, so he first tried the second one; of course, if it still didn't work, he would simply take the third one.

If Hitler was really forced to take the third path, then the meaning was naturally that the "four-power alliance" and the fantasy of attacking the Soviet Union, which Chamberlain and his ilk had never forgotten, would finally be realized. Under such an urgent situation of close combat, the Soviet Union had no choice but to resolutely accept Germany's proposal and sign the "Non-Aggression Treaty." Therefore, Britain and France scolded the Soviet Union for "betrayal," but in fact, it was self-defense.

The signing of this non-aggression treaty was very confidential beforehand. Except for Italy, no outsider knew about it. The Japanese diplomatic representative immediately went to see Ribbentrop after the news was announced, intending to make a final rescue, but it was too late. After a hasty half-hour conversation, Ribbentrop boarded the plane to Moscow.

In addition to the announced clauses, it is said that there are also some tacit understandings in this treaty. Now we already know for sure that there are probably two points: (1) Germany absolutely abandons Japan. In the event of a war between Japan and the Soviet Union, Germany will no longer intervene. (2) Germany tacitly agrees to the independence of the countries surrounding the Soviet Union, forming a barrier between each other.

(3) Prospects for the Future International Situation

In the past two days, the tension in the European situation has really reached its peak! In the past, everyone predicted the situation with a standard of one month or one week, but now, we can only use a period of one day or at most two days as the standard. However, from various symbols, we can judge that Hitler is not prepared to fight at this time unless he has to! And even more unwilling to fight is Mussolini. They are still practicing "armed diplomacy."

What deserves attention is Britain's attitude. Today, the sum of British public opinion is that absolutely advocating war occupies an absolute advantage. Some radical people even believe that regardless of whether Germany attacks Poland, Britain and France should first give Germany an "ultimatum" and force it to restore the freedom of Czechoslovakia, otherwise, it would be better to go to war with it now. According to the views of their faction, if we fight now, Poland can be involved. In the event of a full-scale war between Germany and Poland, the Soviet Union will naturally have to join in the end.

However, what has become the most worrying target for Britain is Poland's attitude. There is no doubt that in a situation where the Soviet Union does not join, Poland may have the possibility of compromise with Germany. In the event of a compromise between Germany, Poland, and Italy, the future troubles for Britain and France would be unimaginable!

Therefore, the diplomacy of Britain and France in the past two days has focused on consolidating Poland's attitude, but it is not yet clear what the results will be. The sacrifice of Czechoslovakia at the Munich Conference last year is the biggest root cause of the current predicament of Britain and France, which are caught in a dilemma between war and peace.

### Any Change to the Chinese Status Quo Should Be Participated in by the Chinese Side

The United States Firmly Expresses Its Position on the Shanghai Situation; Admiral Hepburn Has Already Come to Shanghai in a Hurry

The British Ambassador is Studying Rear Admiral Lummus' Report

U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull issued a U.S. foreign policy on the 12th, solemnly stating that "opposition to any unilateral changes in the Far East status through the use of force or other means" is entirely directed at Japan's recent actions to pressure the Shanghai concessions. This is contrary to the sudden invitation by the Japanese Marine Corps Commander in Shanghai, Rokuo, to the commanders of the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai the day before yesterday to attend a meeting at the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters in Hongkou, suggesting an adjustment to the defense zones of the troops stationed in Shanghai by various countries. The diplomatic community believes that this move is of great significance. In the past few days, the Japanese and puppet forces have invaded the road construction beyond the boundary under the principle of not interfering with the Bureau of Public Works' exercise of police powers, occupying all the key points! The Bureau of Public Works, in order to deal with the situation prudently, did not take direct action at the time, and even made concessions to negotiate with them. Now, the Japanese side has further interfered with the actions of the troops stationed in Shanghai by various countries, and its development is worthy of attention. The development situation yesterday is recorded below.

### The American Representative Has Extensive Powers

Washington, AP, 15th - Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the U.S. government is very concerned about the situation in Shanghai, and especially concerned about the concession defense force meeting convened by the Japanese Navy yesterday. He has received reports about the meeting, but the State Department does not yet know the details of the Japanese plan. Hull also said that the scope of authority of the U.S. representative in China is quite broad, so Admiral Hepburn, commander of the Asian Fleet, may also participate in similar meetings as yesterday.

### The Shanghai Situation is Awaiting Development

Moreover, all observers here can recall Hull's recent statement, which is that the U.S. government is determined to oppose unilateral action to change the status quo of the Shanghai concessions. Therefore, the reporter asked whether President Wissford would formally reiterate this claim to the Japanese government. According to Secretary of State Hull's answer, the timing is not yet ripe, depending on the progress of the Shanghai situation. Well-informed sources here believe that before changing the status quo of any part of China, representatives of the Chinese side should attend the meeting, and the U.S. government has already stated this position in its note to Japan.

### There Are Still Some Subtle Points

Havas Agency, Washington, 14th - According to news from Shanghai, the U.S. government has decided to oppose the discussion of changing the status quo of the public concession there. When Secretary of State Hull met with reporters today, he was asked about this matter, and he believed that there were some subtle points in the Shanghai situation, but he was unwilling to express his opinions, only saying that the situation has not yet reached a certain stage that requires the United States to come out and resist. He also refused to explain what this meant.

### Admiral Hepburn Suddenly Returned to Shanghai Yesterday

Admiral Hepburn, commander of the U.S. Asian Fleet, came to Shanghai from North China on the 6th of this month to instruct the mobilization of U.S. warships and to summon Rear Admiral Grassford, commander of the Yangtze River Fleet. He suddenly left Shanghai for Qingdao on the afternoon of the 7th. It is now known that Commander Hepburn returned suddenly yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. from Qingdao on the private fast ship "Isabel". As for whether Commander Hepburn's visit is related to the Japanese request to change the foreign military defense zone, although it has not been confirmed by the U.S. Navy, reporters have learned that Commander Hepburn revealed before leaving Shanghai on the 7th that he would come to Shanghai on the flagship "Augusta" at the end of September. Now he has suddenly changed his schedule and rushed from Qingdao, and everyone believes that it is not unrelated to the Japanese request to change the defense zone.

### Japan Plans to Take Over the British Military Defense Zone

The day before yesterday, the Japanese Marine Corps Commander Shishido convened a meeting of the commanders of the British, American, and Italian defense forces stationed in Shanghai at the Hongkou Marine Corps Headquarters, requesting an adjustment of the defense zone. Although the specific plan is said to be submitted to the commanders of the defense forces of various countries in a few days, it is impossible to know. However, it is rumored that the real intention of the Japanese side is to take over the existing British military defense zone, and they hope to realize it within a month. According to another report, the Japanese side requested at the meeting that Britain and France withdraw their troops and that the security of the concession be handled by the troops of neutral countries, but this statement could not be confirmed.

The English-language "Great America Evening Post" said that there is no official report or detailed report on the meeting of the commanders of the defense forces of various countries in Shanghai initiated by the Japanese naval authorities yesterday (the 14th) morning. According to reliable sources, the Japanese army and navy authorities hinted that the reason for inviting the commanders of the defense forces to meet yesterday was to take over the British military defense zone in western Shanghai. The "North China Daily News" also said that it heard from reliable sources that the Japanese side convened the meeting to discuss some important events, one of which was the Japanese request for British and French troops to withdraw from Shanghai. Whether the issue of roads outside the boundary was discussed has not been announced. Rear Admiral Simmons, commander of the British forces stationed in Shanghai, will submit a report to Sir Cole, the British ambassador to China. Without receiving this report, Ambassador Cole cannot announce anything about the meeting.

### The Commanders of Various Countries Remained Noncommittal

It is confirmed that at the meeting held at the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters the day before yesterday, after the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps Shishido delivered a speech and proposed the "Suggestion to Change the Shanghai Defense Plan," the commanders of the troops stationed in various countries who attended the meeting at the time did not express their approval or disapproval due to the suddenness of the incident. After a brief rest, the commanders of the British, American, and Italian defense forces exchanged opinions privately and decided to convene a joint staff meeting to submit the Japanese suggestion to a thorough discussion meeting before replying. The rumor that the commanders of the British, American, and Italian defense forces have already agreed to the Japanese suggestion and allowed the Japanese side to revise the specific plan has been denied by a military authority of a certain country yesterday.

### The Matter is of Great Importance, Please Consult the Government

According to a British official in Shanghai, the Shanghai defense force distribution plan was drafted in 1931 and revised in 1934. It was approved by the meeting of the commanders of the defense forces stationed in Shanghai in various countries and submitted to the governments of various countries for record. The distribution decided at that time was roughly as follows: (1) British troops were stationed in the area of North Henan Road, North Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road, the Bund, Jessfield Road, Great Western Road, and Columbia Road. (2) American troops were stationed in the area of Chengdu Road, Hart Road, and Small Soochow Road. (3) Italian troops were stationed in the area of Rue Robert, and Jiaozhou Road. For five years, everything has been safe and sound. It is surprising that the Japanese side is now proposing to change it. From my personal opinion, it is believed that the commanders of the defense forces of various countries seem unable to make decisions on their own. Because U.S. President Weissford and Secretary of State Hull have stated that they "oppose any unilateral changes in the Far East status through the use of force or other means," this proposition has always been supported by the British government. Then, the Japanese "change of the Shanghai defense plan" is actually in conflict with the diplomatic policies of Britain and the United States. The commanders of the defense forces of various countries seem to have no choice but to consult their respective governments, and they will not accept it rashly.

### A Glimpse of the Situation in Western Shanghai Yesterday

The situation in western Shanghai yesterday remained unchanged. The puppet police station at No. 92 Jessfield Road posted a notice saying that the police power in western Shanghai had been taken over by the puppet government, and openly invited the personnel of the Bureau of Public Works to surrender. This is what people at home and abroad are most concerned about.

The Old Iron Wire Mesh Was Completely Removed

After the Lin Mansion at No. 448 Hart Road (west of Difen Road) was invaded by Japanese military police and puppet police on the 13th, the lead wire mesh along the road outside the wall, which was originally erected by the patrol room, has now been completely removed. The interior is being repaired in cooperation with the workers. There are four puppet police stationed at the original side door and the newly opened gate. The patrol room sent an armored vehicle to patrol the Difen Road and Ferguson Road area yesterday, and the search of passing pedestrians was very strict.

Building Fortifications and Patrolling Day and Night

The gate of the 31st asylum of the Tz'u Lien branch at No. 11 Jessfield Road is often closed. Within the defensive sandbags built at the gate, there are still four puppet police guarding. The bungalow in the house that has been newly occupied has hired workers to build stoves for use as a kitchen, and a toilet is being built next to it. Sandbags were used to build fortifications in front of the office. Japanese and puppet forces inspected the asylum and the refugee children's middle school day and night, but there were no other actions.

Posting Notices to Recruit Police Officers

At the intersection of Connaught Road and the Malu Bridge, the small fortress newly built at the gate of the Japanese Military Police Western District Headquarters and the Puppet Police Western Shanghai Branch has not yet been completed. The situation of vigilance is different from the past. However, the puppet police branch suddenly posted a notice yesterday, persuading the patrolmen of the Bureau of Public Works to surrender to the puppet police bureau. It was signed by Wang Delin, the puppet police chief. The content roughly stated, "The police power in western Shanghai now belongs to the 'Reform Government.' All personnel of the Police Department of the Bureau of Public Works can come to this bureau to surrender and will be paid according to the rank set by the 'Reform Government.' Application forms can be obtained from the 'Shanghai Western Branch of the Public Security Bureau.'" Those who saw it just laughed it off.

The Situation in Various Places Has Not Changed Significantly

The situation of the puppet police posting and guarding at Siming Villa on Yu Yuan Road, the New Central Village, the Qianjia Alley opposite Yuguang Village, and other places has not changed. Only the puppet police chiefs came to inquire by car from time to time. At No. 1760 Jing'an Temple Road, the dormitory for employees of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, all the residents have moved out. The Japanese and puppet forces seem to have set up an office in the house, because Japanese military police and puppet police appear and disappear in it from time to time, and in addition to the six puppet police stationed at the door, military trucks often park there.

### Chongqing "Saodang" Editorial: Japan Provokes Third Countries

Japan Plans to Revise the Shanghai Defense Affair, and Various Countries Should Not Be Deceived by Threats

Chongqing, Reuters, 15th - This morning's editorial in the "Saodang" newspaper criticized that the Shanghai Japanese authorities convened a meeting yesterday to suggest revising the Shanghai defense arrangement, saying that various countries should not be deceived by Japan's threats. The only purpose of Japan today is to end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible. Since Japan has been unable to find a way out in the war in China, it is ridiculous to believe that it will provoke third countries.

### The Two Concessions Will Start Alert Today

The "September 18th" anniversary is coming soon. In order to ensure the safety of the people living in the concessions, the two concession authorities have decided to start special defense measures today (16th). The Chinese and Western detectives in the two concessions have begun emergency preparations these days, and the inspection of vehicles of passersby is very serious. Iron wire mesh at the intersections of Chinese and foreign concessions will be gradually closed in unnecessary places.

### President Kung's Birthday Ceremony to Be Used for Disaster Relief and Poverty Alleviation

To Be Used for Winter Clothing Donations and Scholarships, Collected by Central Banks Everywhere

The 19th of this month is President Kung's 60th birthday. When friends and relatives offered birthday gifts, President Kung firmly refused to accept them because he believed that material resources should not be wasted during the war. Therefore, it was decided by all parties to transfer the birthday ceremony to winter clothing donations and scholarships, in order to follow President Kung's intention of disaster relief and poverty alleviation. Central Banks in various places can collect this birthday ceremony.

### Commercial Vessels of Various Countries Carrying Goods to Europe to Be Inspected by British Warships

All Vessels Should Prepare Certificates of Cargo, and Contraband Will Be Confiscated

Notice from the British Consul General in Shanghai

Sir Philip, the British Consul General in Shanghai, issued a notice to various commercial vessel companies in this port yesterday (15th). All vessels carrying war cargo to Europe, regardless of whether the vessel is registered in the United Kingdom, should prepare two copies of the cargo certificate for inspection by the British naval fleet when the vessel passes through the European waters. If the cargo is transported to a neutral port, the exact person in charge of the cargo must be clearly indicated, and the word "order" must not be written. If they do not comply, the cargo may be delayed or other difficulties may arise. One copy of the cargo certificate should be kept. Whether it is written or typed, it must be clear and legible to avoid wasting inspection time. According to the British Consul General's issuance of this notice, it is because several neutral commercial vessels recently carried goods to neutral ports. When passing through British waters, they were intercepted and inspected by British warships. It was discovered that the ships were carrying contraband sent to France, which was confiscated. The British government stipulates that there are two categories of goods prohibited from being transported to Germany: Category A is absolute contraband, which is military equipment and raw materials that can be used to manufacture military equipment; Category B is non-absolute contraband, which is food and clothing. Whether the latter will be detained and confiscated by the British side will be determined depending on the environment.

### The Two Concessions Divided into Five Districts, Relief Rice Sold at Fixed Price This Morning

The Arrangements for the Fixed-Price Rice Selling Locations Are All Ready, Each District Issues 100 Bags of Rice Each Time

Refugee Area Funding Difficulties, Rice Relief Will Be Stopped

Eight thousand bags of tribute rice were entrusted to rice shops to conduct fixed-price sales in five districts of the two concessions to relieve the people's food shortage. After many days of preparation, arrangements have been completed, and it was decided to sell at a fixed price for five hours in the morning and afternoon starting at eight o'clock this morning. The heads of each district transported the fixed-price rice to their respective districts last night, with one hundred bags per district, guarded by two staff members and one Chinese constable. It is also heard that the authorities of the two concessions, following the application of the rice shop industry association, decided to send six constables to each district today to maintain order. Details are as follows:

Yesterday's Situation in the Five Fixed-Price Rice Selling Districts

(District 1) The open space at the corner of North Henan Road and Bazi Road. This place was originally where the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau piled up materials. The place is spacious. The mat shed for the fixed-price selling location is built on the left side of the open space. The entrance is on Bazi Road, and the exit is on North Henan Road. The staff of the association has already added stamps to the rice tickets. Measuring tools such as dippers and pecks have been arranged on the ground. (District 2) The corner of Avenue Road and Carter Road. The field is surrounded by bamboo fences. There are no signs around. Three thatched houses have been built in the field, with short fences in front of the houses. Men and women, in groups of two and three, were seen holding cloth bags, going to prepare to buy rice, and when they knew that fixed-price rice could be sold today, they all went home. (District 3) The Heavenly King Hall in the Jade Buddha Temple on Binlang Road is used. The interior layout has been completed. It is planned to open the side doors on both sides as entrances and exits during the fixed-price sale. However, yesterday, those who heard the news and went to buy rice never stopped. It is estimated that no less than dozens of people gathered at the door. (District 4) Shandong Guild Hall (intersection of Ximen Road and Luli Road) was also arranged yesterday afternoon. Many poor people went to inquire about the news and fixed-price methods. (District 5) Danjing Temple on West Ains Road was arranged before 5 pm yesterday. However, districts four and five both have vacant houses that can be used, so there is no need to build cool sheds, etc., so they can be applied with a little arrangement. In addition to those assigned by the association, each district also sends eight staff members and three old clerks. Each district first allocates 100 bags of rice. After these 100 bags are sold out, the money will be sent to the Refugee Association, and then another 100 bags will be allocated for sale. Today, the union has posted the procedures and methods of the fixed-price sale in the area to inform the public.

Buy Rice Tickets First, and Issue Rice Based on the Tickets

The fixed-price procedures stipulate that rice tickets must be purchased first, and then rice will be issued based on the tickets. The rice tickets are all serial numbers. The two-sheng ticket sold for four corners is in black, the five-sheng ticket sold for one yuan is in blue, and the one-dou ticket sold for two yuan is in red. The upper end of the ticket indicates "Shanghai Rice Industry Association handles fixed-price rice tickets for various groups." The number of sheng of rice is in the center, and a date stamp is added to the upper corner. At the bottom are the words "Not valid in other places, invalid the day after tomorrow." Each fixed-price location stamps its own seal on the rice ticket. There is a hidden stamp on the dotted line between the rice ticket and the stub to prevent fraud. In addition to the person designated by the Rice Industry Association being responsible for hosting the fixed-price affairs in each district, Mr. Yu Qiaqing also appointed personnel to assist in handling them: Sun Zongqiao in the first district, Zhang Qiruo in the second district, Xin Peinian in the third district, Jiang Menggu in the fourth district, and Huang Qingfang in the fifth district. A letter has been sent to Zhang Nianxuan, chairman of the Rice Industry Association, requesting verification.

Please Establish a Fixed-Price Flour Location

Wang Jinwen, Chu Shaoyu, and Ouyang, representatives of the Machine-Made Cut Noodle Industry Association, believe that the price of flour has soared beyond the price of rice. In the past, during rice shortages, flour factories organized fixed-price distribution locations to help the poor. Now the price of flour has risen to more than seven yuan, which is more than 10% higher than the price of rice. Each bag weighs 44 market catties, equivalent to 21,000 cash coins, which has never been heard of in history. Therefore, they propose that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convene various flour manufacturers to discuss and determine the fixed price and establish a fixed-price sales location to provide relief.

The Reduction of Rice Relief in the Refugee Area Cannot Be Reduced Any Further

The Supervisory Committee of the Nanshi Refugee Area has recently found it difficult to raise donations due to the impact of the European War, and everything is expensive. It was originally planned to stop distributing relief rice to 19,000 civilians at a rate of five taels per person per day from the 8th of this month. Later, after the general office of the Supervisory Committee tried its best to negotiate with the highest authorities of the Supervisory Committee, the result was that the relief rice would be reduced by half for another week starting from the 9th, and then stopped. Because the period is short, the deadline is approaching in a blink of an eye. It is a pity to suddenly cut off the relief for the livelihood of civilians, and it is not charitable. Moreover, the Supervisory Committee has an international organization, and it has started relief in the past with satisfactory results. Although it is now facing various difficulties, it is not a good policy to completely cut off rice relief to civilians. It is required that the Supervisory Committee decide to continue distributing half of the relief rice indefinitely, and at the same time, conduct a detailed investigation among the 19,000 civilians who are receiving the stolen rice. If they are indeed extremely poor, they can enter the shelter run by the association for care. Now the office has already explored the original site of the former Chinese Merchants Flour Exchange at Xinkaihe on Minguo Road to open a new shelter, specializing in accommodating the extremely poor who have stopped receiving rice relief. However, after the new shelter is filled with extremely poor civilians, all half-distributed relief rice will be stopped.

### The Issue of the Soviet Consulate's Relocation

The Official Announcement of Relocation Does Not Specify Where It Will Be Moved. The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that there was a notice in both Chinese and Russian posted at the entrance of the Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai in a lane on Shanzhong Road, stating that it would be moved to another location on the 18th of this month, and details would be announced later. However, the staff of the Soviet Consulate General seemed quite suspicious about this. One of them told reporters that he was not aware that a notice had been posted. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the consulate will return to its old building on Huangpu Road now. Last week, the Soviet Consulate General suddenly received instructions from Moscow, instructing it to move back to the old building on the north bank of Suzhou Creek. Therefore, repairs began on Monday, and some furniture has also been transported back to it. However, consulate staff still deny that they will return to the old building, saying that only some of the furniture has been moved back. Therefore, the destination of the Soviet Consulate General's relocation is still a question. It is said that they are currently looking for a house on the south bank of Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession.

### Moufu Safely Returned to Shanghai, Continuing the Shanghai-Ningbo Route, Avoiding Detention by the British Navy, the Original Plan to Suspend Navigation, Now the Coastal Area is Not Unsafe, Continue the Original Route

Sandaowan Navigation

Since the outbreak of the European War, all the mail ships of German merchants sailing on the Europe-Asia line have been suspended to avoid detention by the British Navy. There have been various rumors about whether the Moufu, Hana, and Sanfu ships of German merchants on the Shanghai-Ningbo line will continue to sail, which is of great concern to the general public traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo. Now it is learned from the shipping department of the Liyuan Foreign Firm that the German ships sailing on the coasts of the Allied Powers are not affected. Therefore, the Moufu ship of the firm, after loading its cargo, left the town at 10:30 the night before and arrived safely in port yesterday afternoon. The ship docked at Jinliyuan Wharf. All the luggage that the passengers who came to Shanghai last time did not have time to transport was also loaded and transported to Shanghai. Passengers can collect it from the company with their baggage slips. It is also learned that the ship will continue to sail as usual in the future, but the date of departure has not yet been determined.

Hana is Also Scheduled to Return to Shanghai Tonight

The Hana ship of the German Far East Shipping Company is anchored outside Zhenhai Port, waiting to unload passengers and cargo. It is learned that it has been completed and is also scheduled to return directly to Shanghai from Zhenhai tonight. In addition, the Haifu ship of Liyuan Foreign Firm is still waiting to load cargo and will also return to Shanghai on schedule. It has been decided to sail as usual in the future.

Haida Will Join the Ningbo Route Today or Tomorrow

The Haida ship of the Norwegian Hualun Foreign Firm, which is being represented by the Sino-Italian Shipping Company, has been approved by the Ningbo Defense Headquarters to join the Ningbo route. Passenger tickets have been sold and passengers and cargo have been loaded. It is scheduled to set sail for the first time today, but if time does not permit, it may be postponed to Monday next week (the 18th).

Shanghai-Wenzhou Ships Safely Arrived at Ou River

Since Taichangxiang sent the Xinxiangtai ship to try out the Wenzhou route on the 10th of this month, Yilong Company also sent the Shenfu ship to Wenzhou from Shanghai on the 13th. Now they have arrived safely at Ou River one after another. The Shenai ship previously sailed directly from Keelung to Wenzhou. It is heard that the goods to be transported have been loaded and it set off from Wenzhou yesterday to come to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive tomorrow. The company has now continued to send the Shenyou ship, which is scheduled to sail to Wenzhou tomorrow. In addition, the Shenhua ship of the company departed from Shanghai at 3 pm the day before yesterday (the 14th) loaded with passengers and cargo to Sandaowan and is expected to arrive there today.

### The United States' Special Concern for the Far East

Entirely from a Trade Perspective, It Is Unbelievable to Participate in the War, What Mr. Zherskins Said

The Shanghai Times reported that Mr. Zherskins, the chief of the Los Angeles Zherskins Trust Company in the United States, traveled around the world and arrived in Shanghai three days ago from Europe by ship. A reporter visited him at the Hua Mao Hotel yesterday. According to him, the United States' concern for the Far East is only because it is related to the interests of the United States. Mr. Zherskins does not believe the rumors that the United States will fight on the European front or in the

Far East

He said that there is absolutely no possibility of the United States joining the war. All the rumors are spread by a small number of people in the United States in an attempt to create difficulties for the United States. As for the United States' future policy towards the Far East, according to his opinion, the United States has no other demands in the Far East except to obtain

common trade

rights with other countries. The reporter asked Mr. Zherskins to criticize the open-door policy that is about to end. Mr. Zherskins said that the United States cares about the Far East only because it is related to the United States itself. In other aspects, the United States will remain neutral. According to Mr. Zherskins, he left the United States about five months ago and has traveled to England, Scotland, Ireland, and Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, and other countries before coming to the Far East. He paid special attention to the

manufacturing, shipping,

and mining industries of these countries and said that the impression he got in Germany was particularly deep. Mr. Zherskins plans to stay in Shanghai for a short time and will go to Japan on the 23rd of this month.

The Elementary Postal Clerk Examination Will Not Recruit Women for the Time Being

The Shanghai Postal Administration received an order from the Kunming Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications this time, because the postal service in the inland has developed and a large number of postal clerks are needed. It will continue to recruit elementary postal clerks in Shanghai. The administration started registration on the 11th of this month, and after only five days, about 1,000 people have registered. According to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, the administration received an order from the Kunming Postal Administration yesterday, because the elementary postal clerks recruited this time must be sent to various provinces, cities, and counties in the southwest after training. Female postal clerks are physically weak and it is inconvenient to travel long distances. Although the administration is very willing to recruit talented female postal clerks, it will not recruit female postal clerks for the time being due to the above reasons. After receiving the order, the personnel section of the Shanghai Postal Administration drafted a notice and posted it at the registration office, stating: "Recently, we received an order from the Postal Administration that the elementary postal clerk examination will not recruit women for the time being."

### German Ships Deliver Various Goods at Neutral Ports

German Merchants Received Advice from the Head Office to Handle Warring Countries' Cargo Lists in the Same Way

According to foreign sources, German shipping companies in this port have recently received a telegram from the authorities of their country's head office, advising that the goods entrusted to German ships for transportation, regardless of where they are being transported, should notify their consignors' agents or the warring countries' cargo lists, etc., to be delivered at neutral ports.

### Remittances and Deposits Have Been Fully Transferred, and the Amount of Legal Tender Has Increased

The Run on Deposits Has Completely Subsided, and the Premium on Remittances Has Invisible Dropped

In order to adjust the funds of the same industry and assist the stability of the industrial and commercial market, the Shanghai Silver and Money Industries Association negotiated with the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Communications Bank and obtained their consent. All banks, money shops, and other financial institutions are allowed to exchange legal tender at 95% of their remittance deposits in the Joint Reserve of Banks and the Money Industry Reserve, which totaled about 22 million yuan at the end of June 28th, to provide liquidity. It was stipulated that payment would be made in twelve weeks starting from July 4th, and each bank and shop would withdraw at most one-twelfth each week. However, if the remaining balance of each bank and shop is less than 10,000 yuan, and the bank and shop need to withdraw in advance to cope with the deposit, the Joint Reserve Commission may酌量pay in advance after strict inspection. Now all the banks and shops have complied with the above methods and have been exchanging on schedule from the Joint Reserve of Banks to the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Communications Bank. As of the 18th of this month, all twelve periods have been completed as scheduled. After adjustment, the legal tender capital of each bank and shop has increased, making the entire financial market more stable. The run on deposits has completely subsided, and the premium on remittances has invisible dropped.

### The Physiological Effects of Marital Life

After a man and woman get married, if they want to produce sweet love and obtain precious happiness in life, it is necessary to have knowledge of the physiological effects of marital life. Because this knowledge can better ensure their health after marriage. Come and grow in the Garden of Love, living a happy life!

When men and women are functionally excited, they have nervous expressions, and the reactions of their pulses and muscles are enough to affect everything inside his or her physiology. When a man is highly stimulated, a large amount of endocrine fluid from the reproductive glands will naturally be ejected from certain organs to achieve its reproductive purpose. At the same time, this endocrine fluid must also take the opportunity to secrete into the blood to irrigate the whole body. If this effect is moderate, it can regulate metabolism, induce sound sleep and nourish nerves, increase appetite, promote blood circulation, regulate emotions, and make the mind peaceful. Therefore, excessive abstinence is not a way to maintain health, and this is the reason. As for women's organs, they are arranged very deeply. When the function is excited at a fixed point, although there is not as much endocrine fluid as in men, few secretions can be denied! The effect of internal endocrine glands is as important as that of men. Because of the rapid development of medicine, many doctors now understand that many neurological and other diseases in men and women are caused by a lack of physiological relaxation after sexual arousal. In other words, it is caused by the failure of marital life to be fulfilling. Most of the tragedies in modern families are also caused by this.

Marital life should be like fish in water, with infinite harmony and joy. Why can't it be fulfilling? The reasons for this are mostly men. If a man has committed self-ejaculation in his early years, or has indulged in sex early, and his reproductive gland fluid is exhausted, then symptoms such as kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, neurasthenia, and scattered energy will occur. Therefore, even when the flowers are beautiful and the moon is full, and the scenery is good, he cannot enjoy the kindness of beauty, but the youth of beauty is spent in vain. Can he not be sad and angry? Therefore, all kinds of tragedies and diseases arise from this. At this time, a man not only becomes the protagonist in a tragedy, but also a sinner in love. Ask yourself, isn't it very sad!

The method of catching and rescuing: According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" is the most effective treatment. After taking it, it can generate sperm and nourish the kidneys, nourish the nerves, and continue to take it can also help growth and adjust metabolism. It will definitely cure all diseases in a short period of time. However, if there is nocturnal emission, you must also take "Himitto's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" (available in Wuzhou Chinese and Western pharmacies and other large pharmacies) to control the leakage and achieve faster results!

The patient Zheng Yiping suffered from severe premature ejaculation and impotence after marriage, almost to the point where he could not have sex. He also had nocturnal emission, brain failure, and insomnia. I gave him a large amount of "Reproductive Hormone" and told him to continue taking it, and also took "Himitto's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets." As a result, he fell asleep and stopped nocturnal emission on the night he took it, and all symptoms have been completely cured for two months, and his health is completely different from before.

### Nocturnal Emission in Autumn Treatment

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Autumn is the season when diseases are most likely to occur, because the climate is sunny and rainy, and the temperature is unpredictable. If you have nocturnal emission and your body's resistance is weak, that is very dangerous!

Why is the resistance of nocturnal emission patients weak? This is very common sense. A healthy man has more than 200 trillion sperm each time he ejaculates. Each sperm can fertilize an egg and produce a new person. Each sperm also carries countless genetic traits and contains a large amount of nuclear protoplasm, which are all formed through the highest differentiation in our body. Analyzing its chemical properties, the most are calcium and phosphorus strong acids, which are so precious materials in our body!

If someone thinks that nocturnal emission is not important, then that is wrong and wrong. Because semen is not only in the seminal vesicles for excretion in reproductive functions, you must know that semen is actually the endocrine fluid of ductless reproductive glands. It can irrigate the whole body through blood circulation, and its function can promote development, adjust metabolism, nourish the brain, spinal cord, and the nerves of the sexual organs, and can also unite with white blood cells in the blood to engage in the work of killing and reducing bacteria. Therefore, if a young man suffers from self-masturbation, indulgence, or other reasons that cause the sperm gate to relax and cause nocturnal emission, he must not neglect treatment and cut off his own vitality. If he can be cured immediately, there will be no major harm. If he continues to procrastinate and the nocturnal emission lasts for a long time, resulting in exhaustion of sperm and blood, then symptoms such as brain failure, insomnia, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and premature aging will occur. Therefore, if the energy is weak, not only will he not be able to achieve success in his studies, but he will not be able to be satisfied in marital life in the future. He will be hated by his wife. Most of the tragedies in today's families are caused by this!

The most effective treatment for nocturnal emission is to be pure in heart and have few desires, quit self-masturbation, and take the special medicine "Himitto's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" recognized by famous doctors at home and abroad to consolidate the sperm gate and stop nocturnal emission. This is the only way to treat it. If there are the above symptoms due to nocturnal emission, then you must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" to nourish the brain, kidney, essence, blood. And nerves, regular use can also help growth, adjust metabolism, and must be able to restore perfect health in a short period of time. If patients can come to our clinic for electrotherapy and injection therapy, a cure can be guaranteed.

### The Tragedy of Breast Atrophy!

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

It's pitiful to see the old autumn girl, her skinny bones are unbearable to watch! The most heartbreaking thing is that the vows of love are all donated!

Health and beauty, I think are what every girl longs for and pursues? Indeed, a healthy and lively girl is a treasure in society, the soul in men's hearts, and the mother of the great era in the future. If she gets married to a good man, then the love between the couple will be very strong, forming a happy family, giving birth to clever children, and life is so glorious and happy, but how can women get fitness? This is the problem we need to solve urgently.

The wheel of the times is advancing non-stop. The concept of female beauty has abandoned the past hypocritical, weak, and morbid beauty, and focuses on the healthy beauty of developed features. The main features are the breasts and buttocks. According to the medical doctorate, the erection of the breasts and the plumpness of the buttocks are completely based on the soundness of the function of the reproductive gland ovaries and the vigorous metabolism. If a woman is unfortunately invaded by symptoms such as irregular menstruation, white discharge, damage from self-masturbation, excessive childbirth, anemia, hemoptysis, and weakness after childbirth, the function of the ovaries will be destroyed, and the breasts will not develop well. Even if there is good development, it will gradually atrophy to the point where it is as flat as a man. Such women, even if they are decorated with beads, rouge, and deliberately dressed up, are not enough to be expected by men of the times. If the love between the couple is no more than that, then the old autumn girl will be abandoned and disregarded in the future, and will suffer the pain of wandering! To seek rescue, you can only immediately buy and take the ovary preparation female "Reproductive Hormone" to enhance the function of the ovaries and vigorous metabolism, then not only the above symptoms can be completely cured. It can also make the breasts erect, the buttocks plump, the cheeks rosy, and enjoy youth, happiness, and happiness for a long time.

### New Trends in the Radical Treatment of Gonorrhea

Due to scientific progress, the treatment of gonorrhea has taken on a new direction. We only need to follow this new direction to avoid the danger of going in the wrong direction and misdiagnosis. Originally, when gonorrhea first starts, the momentum is fierce, but if it can be radically cured according to new scientific methods, it is actually a very easy thing. Because the pathogenic bacteria of gonorrhea - diplococci - are based only in the anterior urethra, it is very easy to eradicate, so if the treatment is effective, it can be cured in one to two weeks. As for once it becomes old white turbidity, because the place where the bacterial toxin is scattered is large and far away, local therapy will definitely not be effective. Only the use of extensive bactericidal therapy can have the confidence to quickly cure it. Other than that, don't try to eliminate the erratic gonococci. On the contrary, it will accelerate the destruction of healthy tissue by accelerating the virus, making the trend of gonorrhea more profound.

The latest invention and extremely scientific treatment for gonorrhea is the lymphatic fluid parallel flow electrotherapy invented by Dr. Leayana of Germany. It directly destroys the gonococci, and also uses the latest chemical therapy to wipe out the gonococci everywhere. In the early stages of gonorrhea, you can also use specially made Baijia vaccine to increase the patient's resistance and destroy the gonococci. Lymphatic fluid electrotherapy has a bactericidal power that can directly reach the lesion and can filter lymphatic fluid, so that the patient's blood is restored to purity. Only after it is cured in this way can it never occur again.

### Finance The US-UK Exchange Rate Enters the Four Yuan Level, the Shanghai Exchange Market is Loose for the UK and Tight for the US

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: The US dollar depreciated against the pound again by 7.125, breaking through the four-yuan level. Therefore, HSBC's listing, the US dollar suddenly reduced by two or five, creating an unprecedented tight price of 5.625 yuan. The Dutch, Luxembourg, and Japanese dollars also reduced. Other exchanges, such as the UK dollar, were flat. The domestic market was also tight for the US due to the exchange rate relationship.

### Movement and Stillness

— Yun Tian

Regarding movement and stillness, some time ago, many people wasted a lot of breath discussing it. There were results; there is only one truth, although everyone's views differ. To say that there is no movement in the world is like saying that an arrow shot out; its change of position can be explained as merely a continuation of stillness. Of course, this sounds very ethereal and guarantees a timeless page in the history of philosophy. But this is, after all, history, and some modern scholars cannot decisively drag the world into the grave; however, therefore, they inevitably emphasize the necessity of stillness to divert people's attention: such and such greatness lies in "solemnity." The root of solemnity is death, and the dead can be considered the true embodiment of solemnity, lying motionless in their coffins?

G. Lukacs said: "Worldview is the highest form of conscious activity. To ignore it is to obscure the most important things in the person's mind." Some people, because they are "confident of success" (this is also a worldview), hope that everything in the world is like stone or wood, the most elegant things, making themselves dizzy and blurring others—not just the living, but even the dead.

Tao Yuanming is always the ancestor of solemnity, right? Naturally, it is not yet entirely clear. But there is also a reason: "Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the Southern Mountains," that is solemn and great. Then someone brought up "Xingtian dances with a shield and axe, his fierce ambition remains forever" to oppose it.

In fact, Tao also labored. Reading "Returning to the Countryside" and "Harvesting Early Rice in the Western Fields" can make it clear: "Invading the morning to manage the wilderness, returning with a hoe under the moon"; "Going out early to do light work, returning with a plow at sunset." Because he participated in agricultural labor, he experienced the changes of nature in the process, wrote them into poetry, and still extracted its essence. His value cannot be obliterated. Works such as the gentlemanly mountain and water excursions of Xie Lingyun at the end of the Jin Dynasty only reveal their affectation and unbearable shyness. Xie never labored. Outside of fine clothes and rich food, wanting to breathe some fresh air only made his unhealthy trachea catch cold. The sobbing and groaning in "Climbing the Pond Pavilion" has its reasons.

Of course, Tao's solemnity can also be explained by his status as a small landlord bourgeoisie: "More than ten acres around the house, eight or nine thatched rooms... peach and plum trees are arranged in front of the hall." During the autumn harvest, he could still collect some rent from tenants. But now, it is impossible to go to some place to collect rent as freely as Tao did. If he still had inspiration, he would definitely chant: "Picking chrysanthemums, breaking the fence, horrified to see the enemy..."

In this way, even escaping reality is impossible for the Tao Yuanmings of today.

But here, we do not deny the existence of the phenomenon of stillness. Perhaps a wounded soldier in the hospital can experience the unique interest of stillness, thus adjusting his overly tired body and mind. However, after a considerable period of recuperation, he will become too lazy and his muscles and bones will become stiff, which is unacceptable. He should understand the causal relationship between movement and stillness—but stillness is only a temporary and superficial phenomenon. The thing itself is moving at all times; it is growing or rotting.

Being in a static environment for a long time without realizing its decay, when it comes to a period of drastic change, it will more sensitively feel that it is about to turn to ashes. At that time, naturally, even having the time to sigh "Searching, searching... miserable, miserable" is too cheap for him. Li Qingzhao's "Postscript to the Record of Metal and Stone" says: "In the twelfth month of winter, the Jurchens captured Hongzhou and abandoned everything. The so-called books that crossed the river in a continuous line of ships were scattered like clouds and smoke; only light and small scroll books and handwritten copies of poems by Li Bai, Du Fu, Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, Shishuo Xinyu, Yantie Lun, and rubbings of stone carvings from the Han and Tang dynasties, as well as more than ten pieces of bronze tripods and ritual vessels from the Three Dynasties, and dozens of volumes of handwritten books from the Tang Dynasty, were still there when I casually perused them while sick in bed..."

Seeing such a story where the more movement there is, the more stillness is required, one cannot help but think of the determinist's favorite saying: "It is truly destiny!"

### Western Anhui Is Still Ours

— Sheng Dan

— War Zone Memoir

The battles on the eastern front are progressing, while the northern front has also suddenly become tense. Because Huangchuan, Gushi, and Shangcheng have all been abandoned one after another, they want to find a foothold in the Henan-Anhui border area. At the same time, echoing the westward advancing troops from afar, they make a show of force and beat the drums of war towards the foothills of the Dabie Mountains. Therefore, in early September, enemy traces began to appear in Zaohe River, and they indiscriminately bombed Macheng, Luotian, Huanggang, and other counties. Even Dingjiabu, a vital town only thirty miles from the mountain city—leading west to Macheng—was completely destroyed. As a result, the seven counties of western Anhui were immediately filled with the scent of gunpowder. The people of various towns and villages packed their belongings overnight and fled, as if everyone had become a hermit, fearing that they were not going deep enough into the mountains. The Guangxi army, entering from Zatian, ran one hundred and twenty miles of mountain roads. The supplies were not a problem, but there was a panic about the fodder for the horses, which can explain the inadequacy of political work. The so-called mobilization of the masses, in the first stage of the Anti-Japanese War, did not seem to be effective. Therefore, everyone said, we only saw military development and did not see the strength of the people.

However, despite this, no one dares to underestimate the potential force lurking in the Dabie Mountains. Past difficulties have already been overcome. Therefore, even today, a greedy wildcat, with its mouth watering, not only dares not stretch out its front paws but is often hit over the head with a stick, trembling all over. Regarding this, we cannot but admire the firmness of the "mountain people's" will, especially the two provincial committee members, Cai and Zhang. When the sound of artillery fire shook the northwest front, most people advocated moving the political center to southern Anhui. At a certain meeting, the word "Tunxi" was mentioned again. Under the dim oil lamp, as dark as phosphorus fire, people stared at each other's facial expressions. Suddenly, a sharp and calm voice broke the silence. Zhang Naiqi spoke first. After analyzing the entire war situation, he dissected the terrain of the Dabie Mountains, recounting it fluently "as if counting his family treasures," constantly taking out a white handkerchief from his pocket to wipe the sweat from his bald head.

"Tunxi is definitely not an ivory tower," he said sarcastically, his tone very relaxed. "They will attack western Anhui, so why won't they invade southern Anhui? Whether the situation in Wuhan improves or deteriorates, we cannot leave this base no matter what!" He paused slightly and continued solemnly, "The urgent task now is to strengthen political work, make the entire mountainous area's blood flow, and prepare to unleash future strength. We must absolutely not waver in our beliefs!"

Following this, Cai and Qiu Guozhen also swore oaths one after another. Cai cited the example of western Anhui during the "encirclement" period, which was able to last for four years entirely due to the terrain. Thus, the meeting ended, and everyone dispersed with resolute smiles. Soon after, although the mountain city was destroyed by three rounds of bombing and all the buildings became piles of rubble, and mountain caves were used as offices, until now, western Anhui is still ours. No, it may even connect with the Tongbai and Dahong Mountains, so that those confined in central China will feel the pain of being pricked in the back at all times.

But, later news came that Zhang had left western Anhui this past June, which is very regrettable.

### Are German Troops Really Not Afraid of Defeat? (Part 1)

— Fritz Sternberg, translated by Zhu Jijun

Dr. Sternberg meticulously examined the military, political, economic, and technological combat capabilities of Germany and its enemies, and wrote a book——"Germany and an Intense War." In this book, he provides a general overview of the wartime lineups of both sides and the economic development of Germany in recent years, while also comparing Germany's strength in World War I with its strength today. In addition, he also reveals many startling facts about the anti-fascist movement within Germany. Dr. Sternberg ultimately believes that Germany's leaders are deeply aware that, from a sustained world war like the one that was about to break out over the issue of Czechoslovakia, the only possible outcome they could obtain is defeat. The following is his conclusion:

How long can Hitler sustain the war? No one would want us to answer like this: a few months or years, we don't want to compete with astrologers. However, we can analyze those factors that can give us some enlightenment. But immediately another question arises: What kind of war is it? This is obviously a fundamental question, namely, can Germany wage a war fighting on two fronts?

Judging from the attitudes of the world's political giants, a war fighting on two fronts can happen again. At the same time, if China and Japan in Asia also participate, then it will endanger the safety of billions of lives and immediately expand the "local war" into a "global war."

How long can Hitler sustain the war? Apart from the issue of allies, the answer will depend on what kind of major military achievements Germany can achieve in the initial period of the war.

Diplomacy

Relying solely on the threat of war, National Socialist Germany has already achieved more than one diplomatic and political success. It is engaging in the reorganization of the economic system, making the most of industrial productivity to assist the operations of the German army after the start of the war. However, from a purely military point of view, Germany is facing serious difficulties. If the war had broken out a few years later, Germany's trained reserves would still be behind France, especially unable to keep up with the Soviet Union.

French and German soldiers alike are sent to the battlefield only after serving many years of continuous compulsory military service, but the last batch of soldiers conscripted by Germany in World War I were from the 1900s, and the supplementation of Germany's compulsory military service was only implemented in 1935. Therefore, there is a huge gap in between.

Dangerous Gap

No matter how much you speculate about how many troops Germany illegally and secretly trained during this gap period, the fact is that most of the grades from 1901 to 1913, even did not receive even a few weeks of training, because in 1937, the legally trained troops could not be applied. Although in the following years, this gap can be made smaller, but it cannot be completely filled.

On the other hand, France has conscriptions for compulsory military service every year, and the conscripts from 1901 to 1913 have also received military training as good as other countries.

This is the first obstacle for Germany to achieve victory in an intense war. In addition, there are many obstacles on the strategy itself.

### Song of the Desert

— Qiu Shan

"We can rest now, let's stop." My back is so sore, fatigue permeates my entire body. A gale is raging ahead, sand and gravel are piling up wave after wave, I dare not raise my head slightly. I squint my eyes, unable to see my hometown, nor the blue sky. Dusk has climbed up; but the camel beneath me still drags its slow steps. There is no flowing spring, no small grass. Ah... the lonely and distant journey! Suddenly, lights are flashing ahead, and someone seems to be singing a marching song in the desert. My heart is full of ease, fatigue has slipped away again, and I stride forward, kicking up dust!

### Chatting About Theatre on an Isolated Island — Encouraging Lan Yuechun

— Nai Wei

I went to see Nan Tiesheng's debut performance, and before the main act, there was Lan Yuechun's "Bright Sun Tower." It was truly excellent.

I had seen Yang Xiaolou perform "Bright Sun Tower" several times at the Xinming Grand Theater in old Beijing. Xiaolou learned from Gao Deng and was good at being tall, with exquisite facial makeup and clean, neat movements. His horse-riding style was beautiful and can be called second to none. After coming south, I saw Yang Ruiting and Liu Kuiguan perform this. Yang and Liu both rose to fame in Jiangnan with this play, but because Yang and Liu's skills have declined in recent years, each performance is unremarkable, so Lan Yuechun monopolizes "Bright Sun Tower" in Jiangnan.

Yuechun's appearance is slightly inferior, so although he is good at playing martial male roles, he relies on painted-face roles to attract audiences. Yuechun plays Gao Deng and has enough spirit, but his stature is not enough, which is a shortcoming. His articulation is strong, and although he has no voice, his spoken lines are pleasing to the ear. Although his horse-riding is simplified, it can be called clean and neat. Fortunately, there is no sloppy fault, which is worth praising. The three times he mounts the horse have different movements and beautiful postures, which cannot be compared with the ordinary fierce and evil horse-mounting movements. Only sometimes is it fiery, but it feels like it has been contaminated with the air of Shanghai. The opening fight scenes are exceptionally compact, and the spear flowers gain a lot of applause. Although this can cater to Shanghai people's tastes, it also has a foreign feel. Although the broadsword flower playing is not as beautiful as the spear flower, it looks solid. Yuechun has a good foundation since childhood, so there are many merits to his performance. In my opinion, Li Wanchun is far behind him in martial arts skills.

Yuechun came to Shanghai with Li Wanchun ten years ago and has never returned north. After coming south for ten years, he has inevitably been contaminated with the habits of the Jiangnan region, which is understandable. I sincerely hope that Yuechun can modify it appropriately. After Yuechun came south, he was unsuccessful due to bad luck and was at a loss. He sang in Wuxi for a dime, and joined a grassroots troupe in Suzhou. Last year, he came to Shanghai again and performed in the Card Hotel, even ranking below Wang Guiwu. This time, he was hired by Golden Company and became the head martial arts performer for Golden Company, which is not only a great opportunity for Yuechun, but also a chance to raise his eyebrows and exhale. Yuechun is an absolutely promising talent, and I hope he can be unpretentious and diligent. Take good care of yourself. Although in Jiangnan, you might as well take the strengths of Jiangnan martial arts performers and discard their weaknesses, and then the leading seat of Jiangnan martial arts performers in the future will belong to none other than Yuechun.

— Cold Fragrance Notes

Spoken by Ms. Lu Luming, a Silver Star

Experience in Filming

After returning to Dalian, I devoted myself to reading books on film and theatre, and my passion for it grew with time. In 1933, I resolutely went south to try to find a suitable outlet here. Several old classmates, such as Ms. Liu Li, were already working hard in theatre. After meeting each other and happily reminiscing about the past, I was invited to join them and perform on stage. Soon after, I transferred to the film industry and was hired by Datong Film Company. However, after only filming "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm," Datong announced its closure. Afterwards, I joined Star Film Company, and by the time of the August 13th Incident, I had only acted in a few films such as "Little Lingzi," "New Year's Money," and "Mother's Secret." After resuming operations after the war, I continued to act in two films, "Scandalous News" and "The Singing Girl Saves Her Mother," and after filming "Sunrise" for Xinhua Film Company, Xinhua hired me as a basic actor and signed a long-term contract. Now, counting the time, it has been a year. I have starred in various films such as "Demon of Desire," "Young Mistress's Fan," "Fairy in a Cloud Dress," "Transformation into a Human Ape," and "Wang Xifeng," filming an average of one film every two months. The time for rest is simply very little. At the same time, in my own opinion, there has not been much substantial progress in acting skills, and I feel even more ashamed.

Movie and Theatre Impressions

I have a similar passion for the filming work of both movies and theatre, and it can be said that they are equally important. I can't tell which one I like more. But in terms of performance, I think that movies and theatre are different from each other, completely different. Because the style of movies is purely realistic, all words and actions are focused on being natural and lifelike. You must never mix in a bit of artificiality. The performance of stage plays, on the other hand, is another genre and mostly has its own special rules; such as the high and low speed of pronunciation, the advance and retreat of stage steps, and the need for considerable affectation in some expressions and actions. Compared with the performance on the screen, it is really completely different. And it is almost similar to the freehand style. For example, an action or a line is considered very good by the audience under the stage. But if you perform it on the screen in the same way, it will inevitably cause people to feel very wrong. Conversely, the screen style is not very suitable or natural when performed on the stage——it is not emphasized enough. As for the work situation: filming a movie requires constant changes in shots and sets, and the performance is often a fragment and not done in one go. Sometimes the shot is a bitter drama, and the next shot is a comedy. In this way, the emotions are relaxed intermittently, and it is difficult to express them fully. The performance of insects caused by this is often inferior and extremely unsatisfactory. It is really not as good as a stage play, where the real emotions are dripping and completely consistent, which is very pleasant. Even if you feel very tired after the play is over, you feel very comfortable mentally. So filming a movie can only be said to be a different kind of taste, but when it comes to enjoying the addiction to acting, it is definitely not as good as performing a stage play. In addition, the most painful thing about acting in movies is waiting to film on the set for half a day. Just imagine, if you wait until your spirit is very weak before you start working, how can you perform a good play?

I love drama the most, and I also love movies very much. I am willing to work hard in this art garden, hoping to intensify my training from doing more work, and be able to succeed as a truly accomplished actor in the near future. (The End)

### Hollywood's Madmen

— Lisa

Among the major film companies in Hollywood, Mischa Pischa is the best at playing madmen. He is Russian and has naturally strange, protruding eyes and a special kind of idiocy. Therefore, when he plays madmen, he doesn't need any makeup. He just needs to mess up his hair and roll his eyes to act. He came from an aristocratic family in the era of Imperial Russia. His father died in the Russo-Japanese War. His grandfather was a musician in Hollywood. Through his grandfather's support and cultivation, he slowly jumped from the stage into the film circle. Because he is famous for being good at playing madmen, all Hollywood companies are vying to recruit him!

The Process of Wang Keqin's Separation and Reunion with Zhang Xun

Zhang Xun not only liked to joke and scold people outside, but also often did so within the family. He originally had two wives, but later, because he invited Peking Opera performers to sing at his birthday party, he took a fancy to Wang Keqin, a Qinqiang female Dan, and insisted on keeping her. So, confusedly, he counted Keqin as his third concubine. Wang originally had an alliance with Xiao Duan (Zhigui), and before she came to Xu, Xiao Duan was very opposed to her running to the tiger's den. However, at that time, among the female actors, Liu Xikui, Wang Keqin, and Xian Lingzhi were the most famous for their beauty and talent in Tianjin and Beijing, so no matter what, the person inviting the actor had to get one of them to be satisfied. And when Keqin came, he also invited several wealthy people to guarantee her, how she came, she would go back the same way, so she felt relieved to come to Xu. Unexpectedly, at that time, Keqin was at a young age. When she sang "Flies across the stage, wearing plain clothes, she looks particularly beautiful." When she and the clown Liu Lujing played on stage, the kind of soul-stirring expression had already made old Zhang mad with desire. His braid stood up very high. When the party was over, he refused to let her return to Beijing, scaring several guarantors to sweat and dare not face Xiao Duan. Poor Keqin lost the man she loved and was forcibly occupied by a rough husband. Of course, she was unhappy in her heart and always harbored the idea of ​​escaping at the first opportunity. Old Zhang's first wife was an old country woman who was very honest and didn't abuse Keqin very much. Only the second wife, named Xiao Maozi, was violent and unreasonable, and would quarrel with Keqin at the drop of a hat. (102)

Dancing World Sketches (39)

### Star Six Star Chronicle No. 11—Jiang Yufang

After visiting the dance hall for a long time, it is like entering a room of orchids, and you can't smell its fragrance after a long time. Sometimes sitting in the dance hall, listening to intoxicating music, watching the charming dancers, I suddenly think of a question! Why aren't there many male dancers listed in the dance hall? Is it only permissible for women to be used for male entertainment, and not for men to be used for female enjoyment? Can this be considered equality between men and women? As a result, I met Jiang Yufang, and this question was answered.

It turns out that there are many female dancers who have other skills besides being good at dancing. For example, Mi Ling can write poetry, Qiu Li can write novels, Jin Lili and Chen Manli are good at singing Peking Opera, and Ma Yuanyuan can sing Shanghai opera. Jiang Yufang, whom this article is talking about, is uniquely good at Suzhou Tanhuang. Since they have other skills, why do they have to be dancers? This is another question of mine. When I met Jiang Yufang, I had all the answers.

Yufang is strong, charming, beautiful and outstanding. Her dance skills are also proficient. Sometimes she wears a black silk embroidered cheongsam, speaks in a soft and smooth Wu dialect, and dances and talks, which really makes people feel an indescribable comfort. Tea dance is in Dahua, night dance is in Daxin, and she is already qualified to be a red star, but she doesn't have the airs of a red star. You might as well try it. But I'm afraid that if there are too many people dancing, I won't be able to squeeze my teacher.

Wait a minute, after talking for a long time, the answers to the first two questions have not been said yet? To answer this in detail and thoroughly, I'm afraid even a thousand words would not be enough. I can only write two simple and general sentences. In short, men's thoughts and learning power cannot be followed by women for a while. Men cannot match women's modifications and charms, so men sell knowledge and labor, and women inevitably have to sell some charm, and the more charm they sell, the more valuable it becomes. Confucius said, "Sell it, sell it, I am waiting to be sold." This answer is too vague. I'm very sorry. Incidentally, this is not what Yufang said, but what I realized myself after seeing Yufang.
