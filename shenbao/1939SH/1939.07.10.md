### Editorial: Contending for Schools
Our newspaper's editorial yesterday, regarding several recent events in Shanghai's educational circles, analyzed their disputes with endless sighs and an unwillingness to remain silent. We also considered that the positions held by various parties might have both strengths and weaknesses, and that those who doubt this might not find everything wrong, nor those who oppose it find everything right. Considering the principle of loyalty and forgiveness, even being in the right is enough to justify the sentiment, so we did not want to discuss the matter on its own terms, separately examining its essence, judging its rights and wrongs. We only hope that the parties involved will change their ways and do their best. Now, let us put aside recent events in Shanghai and discuss the general issue of contending for schools.

Schools are originally gardens of education, where you reap what you sow. Examining those who contend, it is not a contention for education, not a contention for sowing melons or beans, but merely a contention for the garden and the land. Contending for the garden and the land is for power and for profit. Those who contend for power and profit in the garden have always been unfilial sons, ignorant villagers, and local bullies and gentry who disregard right and wrong. They all lack the talent and ability to create, and their desire is only to occupy. Those who contend for schools are their ilk. If they claim it is for education, then they contend for schools; if it is for the difference in beliefs regarding the sowing of melons or beans, then they contend for schools for the sake of their beliefs; contending for schools, seemingly defending the way, is deceitful and hypocritical. Taking a step back and assuming that the motivation for contending for schools is as they say, then the effectiveness of contending for schools is vague and unknowable, while the first lesson they teach society and students is the fact and action of contending for possession. Alas, can this be considered instruction?

Yesterday, we said that Chinese society's customs and the actions of academic institutions are always under scrutiny. Now, we say that facts and actions will be used to instruct society and students. Is this an overstatement? Chinese culture has over four thousand years of substantial essence. However, what forms the foundation of this essence, and what is attached to this foundation, is respect for Confucian scholars and valuing the way of the teacher. The West reveres learned experts, much like China's respect for Confucian scholars. But when it comes to the way of the teacher, China uniquely emphasizes it. This is not limited to within the school. Serving the teacher is like serving one's sovereign and father, which is already established. The school is also respected by society, from which education arises and upon which customs depend, so the general society is most respectful to teachers. Descending to modern times, the way of the teacher has gradually declined. However, traditional customs are deeply ingrained in people, so not only is the friendship between teachers and students still not superficial, but society in general can also give deep sympathy and love to schools. Because of this custom, we deeply feel that the position and responsibility of schools in China's education, and those dedicated to education in China, are of greater "weight" than in other countries and than other matters. People in the Chinese education sector, the upper echelons pride themselves on being pure and noble; those who decide are also proud of their purity and nobility, and there is a reason for this.

Those who respect and love themselves are countless. Those who do not know what education is, do not know what a school is, and do not know what it means to be a teacher are also numerous. Thus, those who are in the education sector are like guests at an inn. Those who run schools are like running factories and stores. Those who stand on the platform to teach are like clowns trying to make the audience laugh. Some seek warmth and sustenance and nest in schools. Some seek profit and invest in opening schools. Genuine goods at fair prices are valued by industry and commerce. Counterfeit and imitation products are condemned by all trades. But the dregs of the education sector have no scruples and exceed even these. They cut corners and produce shoddy goods. They do not mind misleading students in the front, and do not worry about "returning the goods overseas" in the back. They issue a diploma on schedule, waving them out the door, naturally, "no one recognizes the goods after leaving the store." Making money has its ways, and they are shameless and unscrupulous. Those who have school property to plunder and residual profits to embezzle fight with each other, using laws and force to contend for it. They are determined to get it, considering it natural. They make a great clamor and boast of their success. Their absurdity and ugliness are extreme. There is no need to discuss these people, and there is no need to ask about the reputation of their schools. There is even less need to talk about education being sacred and the way of the teacher being respected. However, based on the truth that you reap what you sow, the students they produce are influenced by what they hear and see, and learn from their teachers. What is their belief, what is their faith, how will they conduct themselves in the world, how will they act in society and the nation? This is a hidden worry for the nation and the race, but it is still a matter for the future. Currently, because Chinese society's customs are always under scrutiny by academic institutions, the shallow-minded masses will get the impression that they are the newly literate class, that they are engaged in a pure and noble career, that they are dignified and up-to-date, and that they see the adults and gentlemen in charge of these affairs. "Those who achieve will be like this!" Isn't this giving society a powerful practical education by contending for schools?

### Measures for Cleaning Up Privately Stored Opium
Set up a superintendent to clean up privately stored opium. The task is to be completed within five months; violators will be punished.

(Chongqing) The six-year opium prohibition plan is implemented in phases and regions. The opium produced in counties where cultivation is gradually prohibited should have been统收 (unified collection) in the 26th year. However, due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it was not implemented as scheduled. The original deadline for complete prohibition in the 29th year is now only 18 months away. According to the original plan, Sichuan and counties where prohibition is gradually enforced were explicitly ordered to prohibit cultivation in the autumn of the 27th year. Recently, General Chiang also issued a secret handwritten order from Yuzhong, absolutely prohibiting any further secret cultivation this autumn and winter, with violators to be severely punished with the death penalty. Therefore, privately stored opium among the people should be cleaned up within a limited time to rectify the source. Premier Kong specially proposed measures for cleaning up privately stored opium in order to thoroughly strengthen the prohibition policy and achieve practical results. A public office for the superintendent to clean up privately stored opium will be established in necessary provinces, after consultation with General Chiang, to be established on a set date and completed within five months through unified collection and strict enforcement to thoroughly clear out all opium without omission, with violators to be punished with the death penalty, to demonstrate the government's determination to complete the six-year plan. The proposal was passed at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 4th. The original proposal and measures are as follows:

"Original Proposal for Cleaning Up Opium"
The six-year opium prohibition plan is promoted in stages, with regulations for unified collection and purchase of opium stored among the people, to eradicate the root cause and implement control. The deadline for complete prohibition in the 29th year is only ten months away. If privately stored opium is not unifiedly collected, concentrated, and strictly controlled according to the original plan, it will be difficult to completely eliminate it. Furthermore, the President, considering the approaching prohibition deadline, specially issued a handwritten order absolutely prohibiting any further secret cultivation this autumn and winter, with violators to be severely punished with the death penalty. Therefore, in the future, the work of cleaning up opium stored among the people must be intensified to achieve daily success. However, unified collection is related to local military and political affairs in every aspect. To prevent unscrupulous military police units and local bullies from selling and releasing opium privately, it is necessary to hold military and political organs responsible for strict investigation and prohibition to be effective. Except for Yunnan Province, where opium production has long been controlled and managed by the provincial government, and the situation in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces, which is being investigated and considered, Sichuan, Kangding, and Guizhou provinces, which have always produced opium, still have a large amount of opium stored among the people. To thoroughly implement the prohibition policy and intensify the cleaning-up work, it seems that a public office for the superintendent to clean up privately stored opium should be specially established in each of these provinces, to supervise and urge the administrative inspectors and commissioners of each region and the county magistrates of each county to strictly implement the policy, so as to assign specific responsibility and facilitate promotion. The public office should have two departments, the first and second, and three sections, the secretarial, military law, and discipline inspection. The head of the first department will be concurrently held by the director of the provincial civil affairs department, and the head of the second department will be concurrently held by the director of the provincial opium prohibition supervision branch. They will closely coordinate and cooperate based on their inherent powers, so as to achieve success. Cases of private trafficking will be handled by the military law section, regardless of whether the offenders are officials or civilians. The director will be selected and dispatched by the General Supervision Department of Military Law Enforcement. The investigation and crackdown on unified collection of privately stored opium, and the supervision of personnel at all levels, will be managed by the discipline inspection section. The director will be selected and dispatched by the Military Affairs Commission. A supervisory committee will be established in each county where opium is cleaned up, inviting the secretary-general of the county party headquarters, temporary senators, and local enthusiastic and impartial gentry who are dedicated to opium prohibition to serve as members and perform supervisory duties to prevent abuses. In addition, each county magistrate should strictly order and supervise the district Lianbao chiefs and Jia chiefs to inform the masses of the government's determination to prohibit opium. Those who privately store opium should be given a deadline to hand it over to the government, and paid according to the price verified by the competent authority. On the day of completion, the district Lianbao chiefs and Jia chiefs should issue a certificate ensuring that there are no omissions to show verification and consideration. According to the six-year opium prohibition plan, opium addicts will be taught to quit in stages based on age. Before the deadline, the opium prohibition organs will be responsible for distributing opium based on opium prohibition regulations and opium quitting licenses, with gradual reductions in stages. Those who previously registered for opium quitting licenses should be re-registered by the local government for a comprehensive registration once, and new licenses will be issued after verification, exempting license fees, as a basis for distribution, teaching to quit, and gradual reduction, so as to ensure that the four prohibitions of cultivation, transportation, sale, and smoking are advanced in parallel and implemented thoroughly. If there are any who deliberately conceal opium beyond the cleaning-up deadline, they will be treated as private possession, confiscated, and severely punished. Those who protect, condone, store, or release opium privately, regardless of whether they are civil or military officials at all levels, or local bullies and gentry, will be punished by military law, to serve as a warning. With such strict measures, the people's opium storage can be cleaned up, and the six-year opium prohibition plan can be achieved as scheduled. The general outline of measures for cleaning up privately stored opium and the organizational regulations of the public office for the superintendent to clean up privately stored opium are submitted for approval."

### British Far East Defense Conference to be Held in Simla, India
Britain and France Agree to Close Naval Cooperation Against Japan
Thailand's Position is Important in Seeking to Enlist

(Tokyo) According to today's Hong Kong dispatch from the Japanese English-language Times, the British Defense Conference will be held soon in Simla, India. Attendees will include the Governor-General of India, the Governor-General of Burma, and military experts from various regions, some of whom attended the Anglo-French Joint Defense Conference in Singapore. According to the Japanese Times, the Anglo-French Joint Defense Conference in Singapore decided that if Britain and France were to engage in war with Japan, Britain would abandon Hong Kong, and the Anglo-French joint fleet would use Singapore as its base. The Singapore Conference reportedly also decided on the issue of India sending reinforcements to Singapore, which will be the main topic of the Simla Conference. In addition, the Indian Air Force will also be an important issue. It is reported that although the naval strategies of Britain and France have not yet been completed, the two countries have decided to take a unified attitude. At the same time, since the U.S. Navy may not participate in the Anglo-French alliance, Britain and France are hoping to obtain the cooperation of the Dutch East Indies and Australia. As for Thailand, Britain and France are also trying to enlist its support. (9th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Tokyo) Although the results of the Anglo-French military conference held in Singapore are kept secret, political figures in Hong Kong have received reports stating that the conference decided to provide Thailand with a guarantee of territorial inviolability. The commander of the British fleet in China, Nobel, will visit the commander of the U.S. Far East Fleet, Yarnell, to discuss plans for mutual assistance in the event of war. Hong Kong newspapers also stated that in the event of war in the Far East, Britain may strategically abandon Hong Kong, and the current deployment of reinforcements may only be Britain's intention to show the world its determination to protect its interests in Asia. In reality, if war breaks out in the Far East, Singapore will be the base for the British army. However, since Singapore only has a garrison of 10,000 troops and the amount of oil stored is not large, the British and French naval commanders agreed that in order to protect the source of raw materials and maritime transportation, there is a need to invite the cooperation of the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, and the Philippines. Therefore, Britain and France agreed to provide Thailand with protection, and Britain will send a military delegation to Thailand. (9th Haitong Dispatch)

### Soviet Union Expands Navy, Speeds Up Shipbuilding Program
(Moscow) Soviet People's Shipbuilding Industry Commissioner Devosyan recently stated, "In the past year, our country's navy has added many new warships, and the quality of their long-range armament and complex equipment is no less than that of new foreign warships. After the Council of People's Commissars and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) jointly decided to establish 'Soviet Navy Day,' the labor productivity of shipbuilding industry plants has reached a new high. Workers in each plant have sworn to complete the construction of new ships before July 24. The entire shipbuilding industry is now striving to complete the production plan for 1939 ahead of schedule." (8th TASS Dispatch)

### Japan Implements Mobilization Law, Forcibly Conscripting Workers Nationwide, Effective from the 15th
The Mainland News reports that the Japanese Emperor promulgated an imperial edict on the morning of the 8th, invoking Article 4 of the National Mobilization Law to forcibly conscript labor from July 15 to engage in businesses necessary for national mobilization. According to indirect news from independent sources, the new clause has two purposes: (1) To expand the munitions industry, which currently lacks skilled labor. This skilled labor will now be transferred from so-called "peaceful industries." (2) To sacrifice industries that manufacture domestic consumer goods and strengthen industries that manufacture export goods. According to the new clause, the distribution of labor will be subject to the following restrictions, invoking Article 6 of the National Mobilization Law. The employment of elementary school graduates (juvenile labor) in industries other than munitions will be greatly reduced. (3) Male workers in "peaceful industries" will be replaced by women. Male workers under the age of 30 will be retained according to special laws to engage in the munitions industry. (4) Various restrictions will be imposed on "peaceful industries," and unemployment will inevitably follow. The government will provide vocational guidance to cope with this. Whenever necessary to secure more labor, the limits of current laws will be expanded for the purpose of transferring it from non-military industries to fire industries. According to the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, under the new law, the Army and Navy Ministries have the power to ask the Ministry of Health and Welfare to register all technical experts for work in factories designed by the military. When making this request, the Army and Navy Ministries intend to refrain from interfering "excessively" with these technical experts in the future and will carefully consider not drastically changing their living standards and environment.

### U.S. Neutrality Law Revision Issue, Two Senate Foreign Relations Committees Have a Significant Impact
(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to discuss the revision of the Neutrality Law on the 11th of this month. Whether the report on abolishing the arms embargo clause can be passed will depend on the attitude of two members. The committee has a total of 23 members. As of now, 11 members favor abolition and 10 members advocate maintaining it. The remaining two members, Gillette and George, both belong to the Democratic separatist faction. During the Senate re-election last year, the Democratic leaders had a very negative impression of them. Now that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reached the final stage of discussion, it is not impossible that these two members will collude with the opposition faction. The government side is therefore quite anxious. (8th Havas Dispatch)

(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has a total of 23 members, of which 11 support President Roosevelt's requests regarding the Neutrality Act. Of the remaining members, except for two who are undecided, all oppose the government's Neutrality Act. The two undecided Foreign Relations Committee members are Gillette and Walter George, both of the Democratic Party. Secretary of State Hull and other key figures are urging these two to vote for the government. The committee is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to decide on the neutrality plan to be proposed to the full Senate. The government side is now confident of winning in the Senate, but may fail in the Foreign Relations Committee. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

### Bonnet Warns: France is Determined to Cooperate with Britain to Curb Violent Aggression, Poland's Independence is Threatened, and Obligation to Guarantee Will be Fulfilled
(Paris) Britain and France will send a new warning to Hitler this week, stating that if Germany does not give up its encroachment on Danzig, it should prepare to fight Poland and other countries such as Britain, France, and Romania. The first warning on this matter will be presented by the French Foreign Minister today, and the British side will be presented by Chamberlain in a speech in the Lower House tomorrow. According to the French Foreign Ministry, the situation in Danzig has eased, and Berlin will shift its attention to Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in the Balkans in order to counter the position of democratic countries in Turkey. (9th Associated Press)

(Toulouse, France) French Foreign Minister Bonnet attended a dinner party of the socialist branch here and delivered a speech, stating, "What we seek is to maintain peace in the world to a certain extent. Today, people in various countries often feel uneasy about border security, believing that violence and war are imminent, which is intolerable. This is why we are determined to resist attempts at control by violence." The connection between France and various countries that love peace and freedom is gradually becoming closer. As far as Britain is concerned, the close cooperation between the two countries is beyond compare. As far as Turkey is concerned, an important agreement has been established with France. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, negotiations are underway with Britain and France, hoping that a tripartite mutual assistance agreement can be concluded quickly. In addition, France has been committed to reconstruction work in recent months, "which has made it easier for Britain to implement conscription. This is a significant sacrifice for the British people. According to the past 250 years, the British people only accepted conscription in the four years of the European War. Now this system has been approved by the British Parliament for implementation two months ago, and its significance is self-evident. In short, the strength of our country's army must be actively expanded without any slackening. The people of the whole country should complete their responsibilities with the same courage and perseverance within their respective scope. How our country's destiny will be is up to us. If the people of the country can unite and be determined, they will surely achieve good results, as can be seen from the achievements made over the past year." (9th Havas Dispatch)

(London) French Foreign Minister Bonnet told the London Sunday Times yesterday, "Britain and France must maintain the territorial integrity and independence of their colonial empires, and maintain peace in the world to a certain extent. As far as the relationship between Britain and France is concerned, it has been good for many years, and the friendly relationship has improved even more since last year. Whether in politics, military affairs, or economics, we can cooperate closely based on realistic foundations. The two major nations are truly interdependent. As far as the European situation is concerned, people in various countries often feel uneasy about border security, believing that violence and war are imminent, which is intolerable. The diplomatic authorities of Britain and France are working hard to mediate, all to safeguard the security of various nations and lay the foundation for peace." At this point, the reporter asked about the future of the negotiations on the tripartite mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Bonnet replied, "We must use various methods to complete this matter."

The reporter then asked about France's attitude towards Poland. Foreign Minister Bonnet replied, "As for France's attitude towards Poland, just read the broadcast speech delivered by Prime Minister Daladier on April 14 this year, and the speech I delivered to many members of the French and Polish parliaments on June 9, and you will fully understand. In other words, France and Poland have already guaranteed each other. If the vital interests of both sides are directly or indirectly threatened, they should assist each other. If Poland's independence and various rights are harmed, the heroic spirit of the country's ancestors will be very useful, and Britain and France will also provide assistance without reservation, which the country knows well." At this point, the newspaper added a comment, "The reporter cannot fully disclose all the points discussed with Foreign Minister Bonnet, but there is one thing that can be disclosed without harming the political interests of the countries concerned, which is what Foreign Minister Bonnet said: The current situation in Europe is very serious, but France's unity and strength in recent months are sufficient to cope with all events."

### Turkey is Not Afraid of War, Negotiating with Britain and France to Negotiate a Permanent Alliance
Turkish Capital Foreign Minister Salaroglu delivered a speech at the National Assembly, stating, "We are willing to maintain peace, whether domestically or with our neighbors. If someone wants to make the price of peace higher than war, we should deal with them and win. Our country's traditional policy of emphasizing neutrality and maintaining peace has been abandoned and joined the armed peace camp. This transformation is due to the crisis caused by the repeated decisions of countries, which led to the destruction of Albania. Albania is poor and has few people, and its appeal to people is far less than that of our country, but it was annexed. How can we not use this as a warning? The newspapers of all-powerful countries often attack our country, and I will answer them here, 'Those who advocate that Britain and Germany should conclude an alliance treaty are now attacking the alliance treaty between Britain and Turkey, which is self-contradictory. In short, our country is conducting negotiations with Britain and France, hoping to establish a permanent tripartite mutual assistance agreement." (9th Havas Dispatch)

### Britain Tries to Make a Final Effort to Promote the Anti-Invasion Front, Negotiations in Moscow Continue, Britain and Poland to Conclude Formal Alliance
(London) It is reported that Germany will mobilize 400,000 people before September. Therefore, Britain continues to redouble its efforts to establish an anti-aggression front.

At the same time, Britain and Poland are quietly preparing to change the temporary mutual assistance agreement into a permanent alliance. The Polish ambassador arrived here from Warsaw last night and handed over the Polish government's views on the alliance to the British government. The draft of the Anglo-Polish alliance was handed over to the Polish ambassador by British Foreign Minister Halifax last week to be taken back to Warsaw for instructions. (9th Associated Press Dispatch)

(London) According to news here last night, Britain and Poland will sign a formal military alliance this week, putting the verbal assurances made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in recent decisions into writing. Britain and Poland originally planned to sign the Anglo-Polish military alliance after Britain, France, and the Soviet Union had concluded a military alliance. However, due to the stagnation of the negotiations, Britain and Poland are now working to sign a formal military alliance between the two countries in the near future.

### Germany Builds Western Defense Line, Consuming Manpower and Resources, Announces a General Account
(Berlin) German Defense Engineering Inspector General Jakob published an article in the "Military Weekly" detailing the defense of the German West, stating that Hitler initially ordered the construction of 17,000 defense projects, but the number has increased to 22,000. To rush the construction of defense projects, sometimes as many as 500,000 workers were needed. The German road construction project began on July 20 last year, with 35,000 workers. However, due to the complexity of the work, the number gradually increased, reaching 342,000 by October 6. At the same time, large teams of infantry and engineers regularly inspect the effectiveness of the defense projects under construction. During the above-mentioned period, one-third of the total output of German cement plants was used for defense projects, and a total of 695,000 cubic meters of wood were used. More than 8,000 trains transport building materials every day. The German heavy industry has greatly expanded due to the need to supply a large amount of armor manufacturing. 15,000 large trucks and 5,000 buses are needed every day for transportation and supply. Alas, how prosperous it is! (9th Haitong Dispatch)

### Germany Plans Three Possible Plans to Invade Poland; Hitler's Reckless Actions will Inevitably Lead to World War
Lucerne, the Swiss capital, The "Fatherland" newspaper, the organ of the Catholic Conservative Party, recently disclosed a document with the title "Germany's Plan to Attack Poland," which is said to have been obtained from reliable German sources. The content stated that Germany is considering three plans. The first is to make Poland succumb without a fight. If the mutual assistance agreement negotiated by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union fails, Britain and France should abandon Poland. At that time, Poland will have to submit to Germany. The second is a military plan, to launch a local war and force Poland to submit. The method is to use the strategy of the Battle of Tannenberg (during the European War, the German army defeated the Russian army in Tannenberg) to surround the Polish army on three sides in the Brenberg area with lightning speed and occupy the industrial area of Upper Silesia in Poland, in order to quickly create a "fait accompli." In this way, Poland's allies would be caught off guard even if they wanted to send troops to help, and Poland would have to negotiate an "honorable" peace with Germany and cede the Polish Corridor and Upper Silesia to Germany. However, the port of Gdynia would still be retained by Poland, and the country would be allowed to build a road in German territory to connect the port with the Polish mainland. The port of Danzig would be designated as a tax-free port, allowing Poland to enjoy its rights. These "moderate" conditions would allow Britain and France to fall into its trap, preventing them from rising up to oppose it, and inducing Poland to conclude a military alliance treaty with Germany. The third is that if Britain and France send troops to help Poland, Germany should first use all its strength to defeat Poland, and then move its troops westward, while adopting a large-scale "peace offensive" to shorten the war period. The newspaper also added a comment, "This German plan is enough to cause a world war. The country's intention is to diplomatically and spiritually frustrate the British and French peace front, so as to establish hegemony in Central Europe first. However, it is feared that the peace camp organized by the democratic countries may not allow it to succeed." (9th Havas Dispatch)

(London) According to various observations, Hitler has temporarily abandoned the plan to create an internal change in Danzig. On the one hand, Germany's frantic preparations last week have obviously eased. On the other hand, Hitler has felt that if Germany changes the status of Danzig, Britain will decide to support Poland with military force. As for Poland's attitude towards Danzig, it has been clarified by the Polish Foreign Ministry, that is, (1) Danzig must be within the scope of the Polish customs system, (2) Poland's rights and interests should not be subject to theoretical or factual restrictions. The militarization of Danzig will be considered the first step of restriction, so it must be opposed. British Prime Minister Chamberlain will also declare tomorrow Britain's determination to fulfill its obligations. (9th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Italy Determined to be Germany's Backer, Supporting the Recovery of Danzig
(Rome) According to the "International Relations" newspaper, which is managed by the Italian government, Italy fully supports Germany in the Danzig incident. The magazine stated, "Since Britain and France have decided to make the Danzig issue an item against the policies of all-powerful countries, it is better to frankly announce that the Italian people will always be Germany's solid backer. Germany has decided to solve the Danzig issue in the German way, just like the Czech incident. When the Danzig issue reaches a critical juncture and forms two camps, let everyone know that Italy has made a decision." (9th Associated Press Dispatch)

Rice Merchants Continue to Place Orders, Foreign Rice Transactions Completed in Batches, Sources are Constant, Hoarders Emerge, Medium and Low Grade Rice Prices Fall Daily

The Shanghai rice market's soaring prices, after the Concession authorities stipulated price limits, have stabilized.  Although rice stocks in various warehouses have decreased, this is a normal occurrence during the transition between harvests. However, the city's overall reserves are substantial, sufficient to meet three months of demand. Rice boats detained in various locations have been released and are arriving in Shanghai. Foreign rice orders have been placed and transactions completed, with a large quantity expected to arrive mid-month. There is absolutely no concern about food shortages for the population. Details are as follows:

Warehouse Stocks Reduced, Actual Reserves Sufficient

According to the Bean and Rice Trade Association's survey last week, the total amount of rice stored in various warehouses in Shanghai was 399,902 bags. This number is indeed nearly half less than the previous reserve of 600,000 bags. However, according to a Xin Xin News Agency reporter's investigation, these stocks are limited to warehouses in the two concessions.  It is rumored that there are considerable reserves north of the Suzhou River and in the western part of Shanghai. At the same time, hundreds of rice shops throughout the city have nearly 500,000 bags in their internal warehouses. Many middle and upper-class citizens have also purchased and stored rice due to rising prices. Therefore, the actual rice reserves in Shanghai have not decreased but are quite sufficient, enough to last for at least three months. There is absolutely no need to worry about the future of the people's food supply.

Rice Boats Released, Sources Increase

When rice boats from various places were heading to Shanghai, they were detained en route due to donation taxes and other issues.  Now, after the cargo owners have cleared the matter by paying taxes, most have been released.  Consequently, the number of boats arriving from downstream has gradually increased in recent days. During the period when rice boats were detained, rice transferred from inland ports and transported by train continued to arrive in Shanghai as usual, averaging four to five thousand bags per day. Wuxi and Wuhu, which are rice distribution centers, often experience border closures. Therefore, some cargo owners detour to transport rice to Shanghai.  Consequently, the amount of Wuxi white japonica rice and Wuhu indica rice on the market has not decreased significantly due to interceptions.

Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Shipped to Shanghai

A Xin Xin News Agency reporter learned from people in the rice industry that the prices of medium and low-grade rice in Shanghai have reached nearly 20 yuan, equivalent to the price of foreign rice. Some rice merchants have already contacted foreign merchants to negotiate orders. Several transactions have been completed, with quantities of 500 tons, 1,000 tons, and 2,000 tons. Most are handled by French trading houses.  Some of it, specifically the 2,000 tons of Saigon rice re-ordered by the grain trading firm that cancelled the initial order in May due to the surge in exchange rates, is scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai before the end of this month.

Rice Prices Stabilize, Expected to Fall Back

The summer season is typically a slow period for the rice market. Currently, sources from various places have not been interrupted, and foreign rice continues to be ordered. Due to the hot weather and the unsuitability for long-term storage, general hoarders and rice shops are rushing to sell their stocks. Rice shops have sufficient stocks and have reduced their appetite for purchasing. Therefore, market sales have sharply decreased. At the same time, the Concession authorities dispatch police officers daily to the market to supervise and strictly enforce price limits.  Therefore, in recent days, rice prices, except for the highest quality white japonica, which remains at the limited price of 21 yuan, have fallen by two to three dimes compared to the limited price for other medium and low-grade rice. Based on the current inventory and sales situation, it is estimated that rice prices are expected to fall back in the future.

After Centralized Check Exchange, Money Shops Suggest Improvements, Based on Pei Yunqing's Proposed Ideas, Six Difficulties, Three Improvements

After the Silver and Money Trade Association decided to implement centralized check exchange starting July 4th, Pei Yunqing, a leader in the money shop industry, agreed with the principle of centralization. However, he believed that there was a need to improve the procedures. He specifically put forward various difficulties and improvement measures to solicit opinions from various shops, suggesting submission to the Trade Association. It is rumored that the Money Trade Association will hold a meeting to discuss this matter. Details are as follows:

Points of Difficulty

Pei proposed the following difficulties after centralization: (1) Sudden changes in habits cause great inconvenience in procedures; (2) Centralized check exchange involves a large number of checks, making it impossible to adjust the time; (3) Checks from other industries cannot be settled because the delivery procedures have not been completed, resulting in a shortage of funds for clearing; (4) Regarding overdraft limits for customers, such as customer A originally having a limit of 5,000 yuan, but overdrawing an additional 1,000 yuan today. In normal times, this could be communicated with customer A to determine a solution. Now, due to the delayed check collection time, it is impossible to contact the customer.  If the check is rashly returned, it will harm the relationship and hinder future business; (5) According to Shanghai custom, cross-outs and returned checks must be stamped with a return slip by the issuing party on the same day before they can be entered into the accounts. Now, due to the excessively delayed exchange time, it is impossible to obtain the return slip. Who bears the responsibility; (6) After office hours, senior staff still need to clear accounts due to funding shortages and cannot leave their posts.  Junior and middle-level staff are tied down dealing with customer deficits, while the check settlement process is still underway, keeping the accountants busy. As a result, everyone feels dissatisfied and cannot go home.

Improvement Measures

Proposed improvement measures: (1) Distinguish between checks submitted to the Clearing Bank and those submitted to Entrusted Banks. Some 42 member money shops are financially strong, yet remain classified as Entrusted Banks. This disparity in fact and status seems inappropriate and warrants consideration for inclusion among the Clearing Banks; (2) All checks from various shops received by the bank can be processed immediately. Each shop should examine and open each check and attach a cover with the total number of checks and the total value, and submit it to the Clearinghouse for exchange. The banks will entrust the Clearinghouse to exchange checks from various shops against the Money Exchange. If the preliminary procedures are completed before the exchange, there will be no need to wait to complete them after, saving a great deal of time; (3) Alternatively, the Clearinghouse could provide 42 settlement books to the Money Exchange, which would distribute them to the various shops. Each shop would directly deliver the checks to the Clearinghouse for exchange, obtain the return slip, and then take it to the Money Exchange for accounting. The banks would also follow the same procedure, submitting the Clearinghouse settlement book to the Money Exchange, and then submitting it to the Clearinghouse for accounting, to streamline the process.

New Draft System, Foreign Merchants Agree to Accept, Wide Circulation, No Different From Cash, Sufficient for Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Funds

Since the Silver and Money Trade Association implemented the new draft system, allowing various banks and shops to use interbank drafts with a total value of 50 million National Currency, it has already circulated in the market. In addition to announcing the draft interest rate daily, the Banking Joint Preparatory Committee has established a Custody Committee to manage the assets provided by various banks and shops, and a Valuation Committee to assess the value of the assets provided. A Draft Preparation Inspection Committee was formed to handle matters related to the preparation and inspection of draft usage. Regarding the issue of foreign banks accepting the new draft, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency recently learned from banking circles that after the Banking Joint Preparatory Committee contacted the Foreign Banks Association, they agreed in principle to the new draft system and agreed to send personnel to guarantee the Custody Committee and Inspection Committee of the Association. It is rumored that American Chase Bank and others have agreed to accept it and have opened accounts with the Banking Joint Preparatory Committee. Therefore, in the future, the new drafts will be widely circulated and can be remitted to the mainland to purchase local goods. The circulation effect is no different from cash and is sufficient to meet the funding needs of Shanghai's industry and commerce. Regarding the issuance of draft certificates, although issuance methods have been drafted, it is now decided to submit it to the Standing Committee for approval based on market needs. However, the committee believes that after using interbank drafts, circulation is very convenient, and there seems to be no immediate need to issue them.

Six-Province Joint Transportation Already Implemented

In order to develop foreign trade, facilitate the distribution of inland products, and increase wartime finance, the National Government authorities have already purchased cotton, tea, tung oil, and other goods at market prices for centralized export. To facilitate transportation, they are promoting water, land, and air joint transportation. It is reported that joint transportation in Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces was implemented on July 1st. Although coastal shipping has declined, inland land transportation is becoming increasingly developed.

Steamships Navigating Inland Harbors Dominated by Japanese Vessels, German and Italian Vessels Increase Significantly, British Vessels Greatly Reduced, Portuguese, Norwegian, and American Trading Vessels Disappear

As the Yangtze River has not been opened, various foreign shipping companies have developed downstream inland harbors. At the peak, there were more than 80 steamships operating, with British ships accounting for the largest number. Since the Japanese implemented control over inland harbor shipping, British trading ships have encountered squeeze-outs. However, German trading ships have taken the opportunity to rise. According to a Xin Xin News Agency reporter's investigation, currently, steamships operating in inland harbors are mostly Japanese trading ships. Portuguese, Norwegian, and American trading ships have disappeared. There are only five or six British trading ships. German vessels include Jiang Ding, Hai Yi, Hai Kang, Lu An, Heng Xi, Hai De, Kai Si Teng, Xin Jiang Nan, Roma Lu, and more than ten others. Italian vessels include Chang De, Yi Ya Na, De Yao, and six or seven others.

Japanese Izumo Battleship Returns to the Huangpu River

The Japanese flagship Izumo abruptly left the Huangpu River a few days ago. It was said to have gone to Fujian to direct operations. It is now reported that the ship sailed into the Huangpu River yesterday morning at 11:00 am and is still berthed at the Mitsubishi Wharf. Hundreds of naval personnel of unknown origin have arrived.

National Goods Charity Sale Continues for Four Days

The Silver and Money Trade Amateur Association held a charity sale of national goods from July 1st to 2nd for two days, with excellent results. The association will continue to hold the charity sale at its premises from July 11th to 14th. More than 20 national goods manufacturers are participating, including China Chemical Industry Co., Wuzhou Pharmacy, and Taikang Food Company.

After the Ministry of Finance Vigorously Adjusts, Trade Between Various Countries and China Improves, Import and Export Goods Increase Compared to Pre-War Levels, However, Deficit in Occupied Ports Increases Sharply

After the Ministry of Finance vigorously adjusted international trade, banned the import of non-essential goods, and promoted the export of major local products, overall trade has returned to pre-war levels. However, the deficit figure has increased more than before. The Ministry has now taken steps to reverse the trend of international payments, so that future trade can get on the right track and balance national payments. Details are as follows:

Overall Trade Has Returned to Former State

Regarding import and export trade from January to May of the 26th, 27th, and 28th years of the Republic: (1) In the 26th year, imports were 491,339,229 yuan, exports were 398,029,342 yuan, totaling 889,368,571 yuan. (2) In the 27th year, imports were 370,685,395 yuan, exports were 248,220,033 yuan, totaling 618,905,428 yuan. (3) In the 28th year, imports were 568,089,774 yuan, exports were 343,034,556 yuan, totaling 911,124,330 yuan.

Deficit Figures Increase Comparatively

Regarding the deficit, after the government made every effort to eliminate it, the non-occupied areas, such as Mengzi, Wenzhou, Tengyue, Simao, and other ports, have all become surplus areas. However, the occupied areas, such as Shanghai and Tianjin, have seen increased deficit due to the government's lack of power. For example, the deficit from January to May of the year before last was 93,309,887 yuan, the deficit for the same period last year was 122,465,362 yuan, and the deficit for the same period this year was 225,055,218 yuan. The deficits in Shanghai and Tianjin ports have set new records. From January to May this year, the Shanghai port was 111,374,000 yuan, and the Tianjin port was 108,259,000 yuan.

Imports and Exports of Foreign Goods Increase

Trade between various countries and China declined sharply under the influence of the war when the war first started. It has now improved, and both imports and exports have increased. Taking January to May of the past two years as an example: (1) The United States was 100,351 yuan last year and 114,254 yuan this year; (2) The United Kingdom was 53,000 yuan last year and 56,787 yuan this year; (3) Germany was 78,991 yuan last year and 66,199 yuan this year; (4) Japan was 81,574 yuan last year and 163,621 yuan this year (units are in thousands of yuan).

Promulgate Measures to Balance Income and Expenditure

In view of maintaining the balance of international payments, the Ministry of Finance considers it an essential element of any country's economic policy. If trade trends are unfavorable, efforts should be made to maintain the balance to avoid affecting the foreign exchange market. On July 3rd, it promulgated measures to prohibit the import of goods during the emergency period, as well as regulations for applying for foreign exchange for imported goods and methods for settling foreign exchange for exported goods. The export of local products can be gradually increased. The import of non-essential foreign goods is prohibited from entering the occupied areas. They cannot be re-exported to the non-occupied areas and cannot enjoy legal prices, which can balance international payments and reduce the overall deficit.

Polish Women's Association Holds Charity Fair, Revenue Over 1,700 Yuan

The French Shanghai Daily News reported on the 9th that, according to a letter from the Polish Women's Association, the charity fair held by the association on June 16th to raise funds for disaster relief was very successful. The total income, excluding expenses, was 1,721 yuan, 4 dimes, and 1 cent.

Revival Bonds to be Redeemed by Lottery This Morning

Long-Term Fixed-Term Redemption and Interest Payment for Finance, Measures to Maintain Creditworthiness Have Been Decided

Although the Ministry of Finance announced on January 15th that it would no longer advance funds for the payment of domestic and foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties, in order to maintain creditworthiness, matured Unification and Revival Gold Bonds and Long Term Bonds will continue to be redeemed and paid interest as usual. However, the payment will be made in full in Chongqing. The principal and interest payable on the five types of Unification Bonds A, B, C, D, and E that will mature at the end of July this year amount to 56,453,500 yuan. Although payment methods have not yet arrived in Shanghai, it is said that the Ministry of Finance has indeed decided on payment methods. Therefore, the prices of various Unification Bonds in Shanghai's gray market have rebounded sharply. Regarding the lottery for the 7th redemption of Revival Bonds, the National Debt Fund Management Committee has scheduled it to be held at 10:00 am today, with five winning numbers to be drawn for a redemption of 1,700,000 yuan and an interest payment of 9,894,000 yuan, payable on August 31st. The lottery for the 12th redemption of Long-Term Financial Bonds is scheduled to be held on September 10th, with 25 winning numbers to be drawn for a redemption of 1,125,000 yuan and an interest payment of 400,781 yuan and 5 dimes, payable on September 30th.

Japanese Threatens Over Abuse of the French Flag, Says If "Abuse" Occurs Again, It Will Consider its Attitude Towards the French Flag

The Continental News reported that a Japanese Navy spokesperson claimed at a press conference yesterday (the 8th) that Japanese officials have already drawn the attention of the French authorities to the Chinese military's abuse of the French flag. If such "abuse" occurs again, it may cause Japan to "reconsider its attitude toward the French flag." When asked what "reconsideration of attitude" meant, the spokesperson replied that the Japanese might not recognize the French flag as a neutral flag. Before making this statement, the spokesperson claimed that the Japanese Navy authorities had instructed the Japanese Consul General to ask the French Consul to pay attention to the incident that occurred on June 30th in Datianzhuang (transliteration), Zhoushan Island. When the Japanese army approached the town, the French flag hanging on a building that appeared to be a church was taken down and replaced with the Japanese flag. If such incidents occur again, Japan may reconsider its attitude toward the French flag.

Father Leys, Naturalized Chinese, Delivers Speech on the Just War, Broadcasts to Japanese Catholic Friends in Chongqing, Response to the So-Called "New Order"

The Continental News reported that Father Leys, a Belgian naturalized in China, who directs hygiene and rescue brigades behind the Japanese front lines in Shanxi Province, recently broadcast a response in Chongqing to a call by Japanese Catholic civilians for Chinese cooperation in establishing a "new order" in the Far East. He said, "There is no peace without justice. This is a question of justice. Who is the righteous one? Who is the aggressor in this world? I can answer: We are the invaded. We defend ourselves by resisting the aggressors who are determined to deprive us of our livelihood. Therefore, our war is a model of a just war, a war of self-preservation waged to seek the necessary and inalienable right to survive."

Shanghai YMCA to Hold Health Education Week, from Today to the 16th, Overall Goal is to Eliminate the New Five Poisons

In recent years, the population of Shanghai has increased sharply. With the arrival of summer, diseases and deaths occur one after another. The overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in alleyways are important factors contributing to illness. If preparations and precautions are not taken early, the consequences could be serious. In view of this, the Shanghai YMCA has scheduled a Health Week for seven days from July 10th to 16th. Its main purpose is to widely publicize the methods of prevention to residents of the city, so as to reduce disease and increase social welfare. Five diseases, dysentery, malaria, cholera, typhoid, and diphtheria, are compared to the new five poisons. It is reported that the association has now arranged and displayed various health materials at the Eight Immortals Bridge Clubhouse to alert readers and promote early prevention to protect their health.

A large picture compares cleanliness, hygiene, and health with dirt, superstition, and death, explaining that seeking immortal prescriptions and eliminating ghost charms is tantamount to suicide, and that paying attention to hygiene and maintaining cleanliness eliminates all diseases. The association also asks stores to post the leaflets on their storefronts.

At the same time, the association has also asked various movie theaters to add health knowledge slides. In addition to posting pictures in theaters, entertainment venues, trams, and public buses, it has formed dozens of propaganda teams to go to crowded places where citizens gather to give lectures on the transmission of diseases, including food, soil, insects, livestock, air, and contact with utensils.

Tension in Northern Suburbs of Dinghai, Eastern Zhejiang Suffers Repeated Bombings, Airfields Thoroughly Destroyed

Since the fall of Dinghai, order has not yet been restored, and very few merchants have returned. County Magistrate Su has crossed the sea to Ningbo and then to the province to request assistance from the authorities. As the Japanese are also coveting Xiushan, which is only four li north of Dinghai, the situation is quite tense. Various circles in Dinghai have been fleeing to Shanghai and Ningbo in droves, taking the elderly and children with them. Due to the sudden change of events, those who fled alone did not bring any clothes with them. The lives of the refugees arriving in Ningbo are worrying. In order to avoid displacement, the Ningbo authorities have set up shelters and appointed personnel to handle the accommodation matters. All Dinghai residents seeking refuge in Ningbo must register before they can reside in designated locations.

Bombing Summary

Traffic circles have learned of the recent bombings by Japanese aircraft in various coastal counties of eastern Zhejiang as follows: (1) On the 29th of last month, 12 Japanese aircraft attacked Zhenhai in two batches and dropped 99 bombs. The fortress fortifications were solid, and there was no loss; (2) On the 5th of this month, 3 Japanese aircraft attacked Zhenhai again and dropped 8 bombs. Houses caught fire, destroying more than 40 houses and causing more than ten casualties; (3) On the 5th, 3 Japanese aircraft attacked Fenghua and dropped 7 bombs, destroying more than 30 houses and causing more than 20 casualties; (4) On the 6th, 3 Japanese aircraft attacked Yuyao and dropped 6 bombs, injuring 3 people and destroying more than 20 houses; (5) At 2:00 pm on the 7th, three Japanese warships arrived at the Hai Men waters in eastern Zhejiang, first launching speedboats to patrol and spy along the coast, and fired more than ten shells at the shore; (6) On the morning of the 8th, 6 Japanese aircraft attacked Zhenhai again and dropped more than 20 bombs. Although various counties are being bombed from time to time, casualties are not many because residents are dispersed in various villages during the day and return to the city at night. The overall situation is still calm.

Airfields Destroyed

The airfield outside the South Gate of Ningbo was bombed by Japanese aircraft last year, and was subsequently automatically destroyed. Japanese aircraft did not disturb it. It is now reported that the Ningbo Defense Department has ordered the Yinxian County Government to thoroughly destroy the airfield and allocate the land to residents for cultivation.

Two Puppet Officials in Caohejing Executed by Japanese Army, Yang Jinsheng and Zhang Gengquan Aided the Enemy's Tyranny, Such an Ending Pleases the People

The Daguan News Agency reported that, according to people from Caohejing in western Shanghai, a small team of Japanese troops, fifty or sixty in number, and puppet police are stationed and patrolling there. Recently, in order to prevent guerrilla activities, security has been tightened. During the day, Japanese and puppet troops set up picket lines more than ten li away and search passing pedestrians. They sometimes invade people's houses and search them, causing unrest among residents. Yang Jinsheng and Zhang Gengquan, local people living near the Huangjia Garden, usually did not abide by their duties, were idle, and exploited the villagers. After Caohejing was occupied, Yang and Zhang suddenly claimed to be maintaining local order and contacted the Japanese army. They were appointed to puppet positions and gathered followers to organize "agencies," creating various pretexts to extort donations and assisting the enemy's tyranny, committing numerous evil deeds. The people were oppressed and dared not speak out. Unexpectedly, Yang and Zhang, with their overflowing evil deeds, were suddenly arrested by the Japanese army a few days ago. They were accused of encroaching on tax funds. After an interrogation, they were deemed to be guilty and sentenced to death. They have already been executed by firing squad. The ending of those who shamelessly served the enemy pleases the people.

Shanghai's Industry Develops Abnormally, Printing, Dyeing, Weaving, Pharmaceutical, and Knitting Industries Small in Scale but Highly Profitable

Shanghai is an international hub, and the prosperity of its business can be imagined. However, due to the opening of seaports and the competition of foreign goods, the national goods industry has developed rapidly in recent years. Some invested capital to build factories, start production, and ship goods. Others expanded their scope, increased production, and improved quality. There are countless such examples. Chinese people are happy to purchase and use national goods because of their low price and good quality. National goods companies and national goods commercial centers have been established one after another, and their business is not inferior to that of foreign goods markets. However, since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Pudong, Zhabei, and Nanshi have been reduced to war zones. These three places were the center of various industries, and it was impossible to start work for a while. In addition to evacuating workers, machines and means of production could not be moved out and were destroyed under artillery fire. Now, Shanghai's industries have recovered, the city appearance is prosperous, the population has increased sharply, and the sales of daily necessities in the market are active. Therefore, industrial leaders have found ways to establish factories and start work in safe areas. However, the scale is smaller, and the profits are quite high. It is reported that the development of these emerging industries is most prominent in printing, dyeing, weaving, enamel, glass, electrical machinery, silk weaving, monosodium glutamate, cosmetics, soap, pharmaceuticals, knitting, and silk reeling. Among them, silk reeling factories are the most difficult. Although fresh cocoons have been listed in various places, they are all prohibited from being transported to Shanghai, resulting in the exhaustion of raw materials and the inability to start work.

Japanese Acknowledge Guerrilla Warfare in the Suburbs

The Zi Lin Pao reported that a Japanese Army spokesperson claimed at a press conference yesterday (the 8th) that the Japanese army received information that the Chinese army of the 54th Division, which is active southwest of Shanghai, planned to launch an attack on the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, it launched a surprise attack on July 6th and fought at Zhangliangting (transliteration), 16 kilometers southwest of Qingpu. One Japanese soldier was injured. On the night of July 6th to 7th, guerrillas around Shanghai also had minor contact with the Japanese army.

Gunfire Resumes in Beixinjing, Although Ferry Crossing Has Been Opened, Ferry Service Has Not Yet Resumed

According to boatmen from Beixinjing who arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 9th, there was dense gunfire and small mortar fire in the Beixinjing area at around 12:00 pm on the 8th. The source of the gunfire could not be determined due to traffic obstruction. Ferry service from the concession to Beixinjing has also been suspended due to the blockade of the Beixinjing ferry crossing. Although the ferry crossing has been opened, the ferry service has not yet been resumed, as security there has not been relaxed.

Barber Chen Delong Posing as a Doctor, Fraudulently Selling Rhombus Powder as Medicine for Huge Sums, Woman Fooled, Report to the Police for Arrest

Barbers from Northern Jiangsu mostly practice massage and cupping. Now that it is summer, illnesses from heatstroke are prevalent. However, these barbers have no medical knowledge. Their treatment of heatstroke is nothing more than following their masters, rashly performing acupuncture, often resulting in accidents due to poor surgery. Since heatstroke is unavoidable during the hot summer months, unscientific acupuncture should be discarded, and one should not try it lightly. However, there is a Yangzhou barber named Chen Delong

Spring and Autumn Inside and Outside Fake and Obsolete Banknote Exhibition (Xue Wen) Open to the Public for One Week Starting Today The Displayed Fake and Obsolete Notes are Worth 50,000 Yuan

Have you ever used a fake banknote? Imagine you are in a hurry to buy something, and when you hand over the banknote, the person touches it, holds it up to the light, and says, "This is a fake note. Please exchange it." Sometimes, they might even suspect you are an "expert" in using "fake notes," and you might end up blushing with embarrassment.

Therefore, having some basic knowledge of how to identify genuine and fake banknotes is essential for everyone. Many people have suffered losses because they don't know how to recognize banknotes, which is a very "unpleasant" thing.

Now, I would like to introduce readers to an exhibition of fake and obsolete banknotes. Take this opportunity to spend a few tens of minutes training yourself and use your own judgment to see the true face of fake banknotes. The exhibition starts today and lasts for one week.

The exhibition is organized by the Shanghai Money Exchange Industry Association, located at 50 Dong Qingyuan Lane, Henan Road, Beijing Road. This association has only been established for over three months, and it already has four to five hundred members.

They have established a friendly relationship with the Silver and Money Industry Association and could have merged, but due to various customary reasons, they have this association organization under the Money Exchange Guild.

According to Mr. Zhu Lizhi, the person in charge of the association, the various fake and obsolete banknotes displayed in the exhibition are worth about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. This is only a part of the collected fake and obsolete banknotes. The total value of all the fake and obsolete banknotes is over 223,000 yuan. If they were all genuine and currently in circulation, it would be a small fortune.

There is no admission fee during the exhibition period. After the exhibition ends, they plan to hold a larger exhibition in the middle of August, during the cool autumn months, at the Great World amusement center. All proceeds will be donated to refugee relief.

How to Identify Fake Banknotes

The fake and obsolete banknotes on display can be divided into four categories: (1) Fake notes; (2) Obsolete notes; (3) Valuable notes; (4) Foreign banknotes.

There are many types of fake banknotes. Almost all banknotes issued by various banks in circulation in the market have counterfeit versions. For example, fake banknotes exist for banks such as the Bank of China, Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Siming Bank, Farmers Bank, Zhongnan Bank, and Zhongshi Bank.

I asked Mr. Fang, another person in charge at the exhibition, about the methods for identifying fake banknotes. He said that it is actually not difficult and can generally be divided into several types: (1) Blurry printing; (2) Different colors; (3) Rough and thin paper; (4) Poor printing of certain special patterns. If you carefully examine them, you can immediately distinguish between genuine and fake.

As for "altered notes" and "split notes," you need to be especially careful.

The exhibition includes these two types of banknotes: (1) Genuine banknotes are torn into two pieces, one side facing up and one side facing down, and then a fake printed single-sided counterfeit banknote is glued on, creating two banknotes. These two banknotes are genuine on one side and fake on the other. A slight oversight and you will surely "swallow" them; (2) So-called altered notes also come in two types: The first type involves changing the numerals. For example, originally a one-yuan note, they try to erase the one and change it to five or ten yuan. The second type involves changing the name of a non-circulating bank. If you are not careful, it will slip into your pocket.

Military Warlords Issuing Obsolete Banknotes

During the warlord era, warlords such as Zhang Zongchang, Cao Kun, and Wu Peifu printed and issued their own banknotes and military tickets to plunder the people's cash. These banknotes all became obsolete after the revolution. Although these obsolete banknotes were abolished, the warlords plundered a large amount of silver dollars.

There are many types of obsolete banknotes. In addition to the three people mentioned above, there are also banknotes issued by Zhang Zuolin in the Northeast in the first year of the Republic of China; Guangdong Provincial Bank exchange coupons issued by Chen Jiongming in Guangdong;

Banknotes issued by the Sino-Japanese Joint Venture China Exchange Bank in the ninth year of the Republic of China.

China's Earliest Banknotes

Among the valuable banknotes, there are the first official banknotes issued in China, which were issued in November of the 24th year of the Guangxu reign. The issuing bank was the China General Commercial Bank, and they were then called Chinese Money Tickets.

The second type was issued in the first year of the Xuantong reign and was called the Daqing Bank Exchange Coupon. The face value was one tael, but it was only valid in the three northeastern provinces.

There is also an even more precious one-thousand-wen banknote issued during the Qianlong era, which depicts two dragons playing with a pearl. It is a rare item, but unfortunately, it was not displayed this time.

Rubles, Marks, and Public Bonds

Among the foreign banknotes, there are rubles from the era of the old Russian Tsar; a 100-dollar counterfeit banknote from the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation; a 20-dollar counterfeit banknote from Citibank (which would be worth 160 yuan if genuine); marks from before the German Revolution; 1,000 rubles issued during the beginning of the Russian Communist era (1917); and public bonds issued by the current Soviet government.

Looking at the number and types of fake, obsolete, and valuable banknotes currently on display, it seems that there are many more types that have not been collected. However, just looking at the part that is currently on display is indeed enough to keep you lingering for half an hour. Readers who are interested in fake and obsolete banknotes may wish to take some time to make a pilgrimage.

Correction

In "After the Rain, the Sky Clears" (155), line 7, "We are the sole hegemons," "sole hegemons" is a mistake for "candle hegemons." Line 20, "This year, more than 60 agricultural science students graduated," "60" is a mistake for "6,000." We hereby correct these errors.

Chapter 13 Encourage Learning and Farming to Store Talent for the Country Retain the Strong and Eliminate the Weak to Select Seeds in the Field

Director Ge said, "In order to recruit more students, we need to produce more silkworm eggs every year, and the existing buildings are not enough. Therefore, I discussed with Village Chief Zhu about renting more than five mu of land to the west of our current location, up to a mountain stream, from the village." Village Chief Zhu said, "This is for the development of the silk industry, and it will definitely be approved. It is an honor for our Freedom Village that the seeds and talents from our seed production field are developed and spread to other places." Director Ge said, "That's one thing. Another thing is that I attended a sericulture conference at the Provincial Department of Agriculture two weeks ago. Because there are more and more silkworm-raising areas in the inland provinces, they all come to us to buy mulberry seedlings, and we have some difficulty meeting the demand. Later, it was decided that each silkworm egg production field should be attached to a specialized mulberry tree nursery. Fortunately, all the directors of the silkworm egg production fields are from sericulture backgrounds, and none of them are unaware of how to plant mulberry trees. However, the location of the nursery needs to be found by each director themselves. In short, it should not be too far from the seed production field so that it can be taken care of nearby. Moreover, students can be led to teach them how to plant, sow, fertilize, and manage soil and pests, all of which can be learned in practice. Therefore, we also need a large field to plant mulberry seedlings." Village Chief Zhu pondered and said, "This needs to be discussed." Originally, there were also silkworm-raising families and many mulberry fields in Freedom Village, but such a large nursery was not within their land development budget. Director Ge said, "I have already found a location for the nursery, not in this village, but in Shuizhu Village. There is a large piece of land that can be used as a nursery. I have already gone to see it and discussed it with Mrs. Xu, the village chief. Of course, they also need to be decided by the village council, but the big picture is not a problem. Although we have to cross a river to get to Shuizhu Village, it is not inconvenient. Even if we don't take the Xie Martyrs Bridge and use a ferry to cross to the other side, it is very convenient. Because this place is not far from the canal on the opposite side, taking the Xie Martyrs Bridge is actually a bit further. We have plenty of boats, and there are also many boats for transporting mulberry leaves during the busy season of silkworm raising! In the future, for convenience, we may open a road from the landing point to the nursery. Or, we can set up a ferry on both the upper and lower banks for easy access. This matter should also be reported to Village Chief Zhu, so I originally wanted to visit you for this purpose. It is just as well that you have come here, sir." It is truly said:

In modern times, many women are elegant and accomplished.
The gentleman's staff and shoes accompany him closely. (156)
Shanghai Prices Sixty Years Ago Mei

I accidentally came across an old newspaper and discovered
Shanghai concession prices sixty years ago, the value of which was so low that
Compared to current prices, they are as different as heaven and earth.

According to the Shanghai Tiansheng Daily, issue 174, of 1878 (i.e., the 18th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty), the prices at that time were as follows: (However, because it was based on cash coins, it has been converted into legal currency.)

White rice: 1.3 yuan per shi
Salt: 1 yuan per dan
Chicken: 8 fen per jin
Duck: 7 fen per jin
Beef: 6 fen per jin
Flour: 3 fen per jin
Eggs: 4.5 jiao per hundred
Pork: 9 fen per jin
Sugar: 2 fen per jin
Soy sauce: 2.5 fen per jin
Soybean oil: 2 fen per jin
Dried bamboo shoots: 3 fen per jin
Black dates: 2 fen per jin
Ham: 3.5 jiao per piece

If the above prices are compared with the current prices, they cannot be measured in any way. However, if we wait another sixty years, who knows how much higher the prices will be?

Local Martial Arts Groups Hold Third Tea Party Yalu

Discussing the popularization of martial arts using the "Little Teacher System"
Entertainment includes "musical saw" and mixed chorus by Yiyou Society members

Local martial arts groups have always lacked communication, and the scattered state is enough to make martial arts decline. Therefore, several advanced groups in the martial arts community have seen this shortcoming and initiated a "Shanghai Martial Arts Tea Party" to awaken the unity of the martial arts community and further improve various problems in martial arts. Each tea party is convened by each martial arts group in turn, and each participant pays a tea fee of two jiao. The first and second tea parties have already been convened by the Jingwu Athletic Association and the Silver Industry Association. Yesterday was the third tea party, held by Yiyou Society at the University Joint Dining Hall of Cishu Building, with the participation of fifteen groups and about one hundred and thirty people.

I have participated in the previous two tea parties, but I feel that yesterday's third tea party showed more significant progress in the spirit of unity, and both the speeches, the issues discussed, and the entertainment were very meaningful. As far as memory serves, I have written them down below as a memorial and reference.

The meeting started at nine o'clock, first with a speech by Mr. Tang Hao, a former senior official of the Shanghai Martial Arts Museum and now a lawyer, on the topic of "Hypnosis and Martial Arts." Mr. Tang has a deep understanding of this subject, but his research is based on science and psychology, so his conclusion is that hypnotism is not metaphysics but science, not theology but related to psychology, and has a close relationship and effect with martial arts. Mr. Tang also cited many facts and theories in this regard, but unfortunately, due to space limitations, I cannot record them in detail.

After Mr. Tang finished speaking, because the people who were participating in the entertainment had something to do and needed to leave early, they requested to perform in advance. Therefore, the entertainment program followed.

First, Mr. Lu performed a novel performance called "Musical Saw," which involves pulling the bow of a erhu on the teeth of a steel saw (i.e., the one used by carpenters) to produce the tones of various songs. Although the sound is a bit low, the elegant and harmonious rhythm is still quite memorable. Amidst the applause, the next program was a mixed chorus by the Yiyou Society singing group.

After the singing program, the discussion began on the issue of "How to Popularize Martial Arts." After summarizing everyone's opinions, the following five issues must be resolved first: (1) Funding issues; (2) Venue issues; (3) Teaching material issues; (4) Centralization issues; (5) Ideological issues. Because of the limited time, and because everyone did not prepare sufficiently for this topic in advance, it was impossible to obtain a satisfactory conclusion immediately. Therefore, Mr. Xu Wenxuan of Yiyou Society, in order to discuss a preliminary method for promoting the "popularization of martial arts," proposed adopting the "Little Teacher System." He said: Because of the current difficulties in the Shanghai environment, it is really not easy to solve the above five issues in order to popularize martial arts. Moreover, there are at most only five hundred people in Shanghai who are proficient in martial arts. Based on this ratio to the population, it is impossible for each person to teach 10,000 people to popularize martial arts. Therefore, the purpose of adopting the "Little Teacher System" is to hope that comrades who have studied martial arts for two or three months will pass on what they have learned to others, or use persuasive methods to get relatives and friends to learn martial arts. In this way, one person teaches ten, and ten teach one hundred, expanding broadly, and it will not be difficult for martial arts to gradually become popular.

Finally, everyone passed Mr. Xu's proposal, and each group automatically recommended a person in charge to host this matter, and continued to discuss it in the next tea party with a written plan.

A meaningful tea party, whether from the perspective of promoting social evolution or from the perspective of benefiting personal physical and mental health, is worthy of promotion. Moreover, martial arts can train people to become healthy physiques and personalities, thereby improving our production efficiency.

Sea Hell Qi Hua

"Pacific Liner"

Produced by RKO Pictures
Showing at the Grand Shanghai Theater

The story of "Sea Hell" is not bad. A ship's doctor treats cholera among the stokers in difficult circumstances, and the chief engineer works despite his illness to get the ship ashore as soon as possible and prevent the epidemic in the hold from spreading to passengers. This illustrates that anyone engaged in any profession should have a sense of responsibility, and good results can only be achieved through cooperation.

However, the play does not have careful scene division, and because the entire background of the film is on a ship, all that is seen is the appearance and disappearance of the characters, and no "drama" is seen.

The biggest shortcoming is still the clumsy directing technique. The chief engineer's "deep respect from the stokers" was not clearly written in the front, so when the stokers want to rush to the deck, the chief engineer's order for them to work seems weak. Moreover, as the stokers die one by one, and everyone is determined to go to the deck, the director only slowly withdraws the fire shovel in the furnace and uses close-ups of the faces of each stoker, which is not enough to describe the uncontrollable emotions at the time.

Victor McLaglen's scene of working hard to add coal in the hold as the chief engineer is very moving, but the director simply did not give Chester Morris as the doctor and Wendy Barrie as the nurse a good chance to act.

Zhenhai Fort

Zhenhai Fort will be renovated, and a candidate magistrate has been dispatched to investigate and manage it. Someone may offer a plan and show a good strategy. The magistrate replied, "Although the method is good, what if there is no silver to pay for it!" Westerners passing on this matter smiled and said, "If the high-ranking officials bring their followers, and their hats and boots are magnificent, they plan to pass by this abandoned fort, so they order more than ten workers to sweep all corners of the fort with new brooms, and the fort will be brand new." Westerners are a little too sarcastic about this matter! However, this fort is too old and rotten, and it is really necessary to repair it properly.

Manufacturing Bureau Recruits Soldiers

The Manufacturing Bureau is recruiting soldiers for the foreign gun team, but military orders do not allow those who smoke opium to enlist. It is said that among the hundred applicants the other day, after verifying and eliminating smokers, only fifteen people remained. Alas! The harm of opium is so deep. In the past, these people devoted their efforts to the frontier and risked their lives, but unexpectedly, today they are trapped by opium, burying heroes. I don't know how many, which is truly sigh-worthy! Among them, there is one person who can play the bugle, but he is also addicted to opium, so the vacancy for the bugler cannot be filled for the time being, so he was temporarily selected.

Poetic Verses from the Yuwang Temple Oracle

Mount Asoka, located in the northeast of Ningbo Prefecture, is towering for thousands of feet. The Asoka Temple is built on top of it, with clear and serene Sanskrit characters, making it the crown of the prefecture. The abbot, Reverend Wuyun, has strict precepts and frequently interacts with men of letters. This summer, some people who were avoiding the heat in the temple, lit incense and set up a planchette on the fifteenth day of the fifth month, to invite the descent of the spirit. The Great Immortal Yuanzhen Taoist descended to the altar, and the crowd asked about recent events in Japan. The planchette quickly wrote a poem: "When the sun rises from the waves, the sky and the earth shake, and the battleships fly across, how heroic! But watch the first, second, fourth, and third day, there will surely be a dragon-slaying general to come." Examining the poem in detail, it seems that the Eastern people are not to be feared.

Zhaoqing: Chinese troops have launched fierce attacks on Jiangmen for days, inflicting heavy casualties on Japanese and puppet troops. They appear to be preparing to retreat. Three Japanese transport ships were discovered on the Beijie River on the morning of the 5th. At 4:00 AM, one Japanese ship sailed to Liyu Sha, shelling Chaolian over ten times before returning to Beijie. (9th)

Fancheng: The situation in central Hubei, apart from sporadic guerrilla warfare, remains deadlocked as it was before the major battle. (9th)

Jinhua: At 4:00 AM on the 9th, Japanese planes attacked Yuhuan again, advancing towards Shangzhuang. Five Japanese warships and four planes provided cover for over 400 Japanese troops, who launched a three-pronged attack. Chinese troops are putting up a strong resistance against the Japanese at Meidao. As of 8:00 PM, fierce fighting continues. (9th)

Jinhua: The Japanese troops who invaded Shitan Town, which belongs to Wenling County, have recently been building fortifications, intending to hold their ground. At 1:00 PM on the 8th, Chinese troops launched a major counter-offensive. The Japanese troops resisted stubbornly, but after a fierce Chinese assault, they were unable to hold and a portion retreated to ships. The remaining two hundred-odd troops went to Ruoshan. Currently, there are no traces of the Japanese in Shitan. There are nine large Japanese ships, three small ships, and two ships each in the waters of Huangda Ao and Xiaomen Mountain. There are varying numbers, between three and five ships, in the waters off Damenshan. (9th)

(Fuzhou) The Japanese army launched a second attack on Pingtan on the 5th. That morning, they used motorboats to transport several hundred Japanese and puppet troops, and under the cover of naval vessels and aircraft, secretly landed simultaneously at Dongliu and Liushui on the island.

(Fuzhou) Pingtan Island is isolated in the sea off Fuqing and is also one of the larger islands among the northern and southern islands of Min Estuary. The Chinese side had not fortified it, leading to the Japanese coveting it. Since a large number of Japanese troops secretly landed on the island on the 5th, the local Chinese self-defense teams, although bravely intercepting them, were ultimately unable to prevent the Japanese from taking the city because the county seat was very close to the coast, allowing the Japanese to use naval gunfire for cover. However, although the Chinese troops temporarily withdrew from the city, not a single person crossed the sea, vowing to stay on the isolated island and fight the Japanese to the end. (9th)

(Chongqing) According to news from the Chinese side today, the Japanese side has launched a new offensive in southern Shanxi. On the morning of the 7th, fighting was extremely fierce in the Hejia Village area. Both sides suffered very heavy casualties.

The main force of the Japanese army, consisting of 7,000-8,000 troops, repeatedly attacked the Chinese. As of the 8th, over 2,000 artillery shells had been fired, and the Chinese defenses had been almost completely destroyed. However, fierce fighting continues in the Zhangwang Ding Village area. A certain large Chinese force has outflanked the Japanese right wing from [omitted] and attacked Yushangou, killing many Japanese troops.

### Central Government Holds Northern Expedition Swearing-In Anniversary; President Chiang Personally Chairs the Gathering; Tea Party Held to Host Government Officials

(Chongqing) Today, the 9th, is the anniversary of the swearing-in of the National Revolutionary Army for the Northern Expedition. The Central National Government jointly held a memorial meeting at 8:00 AM. Over 400 members of the Central National Government Committee and party, government, and military officials attended. President Chiang personally chaired the meeting, and the ceremony was performed as prescribed. Subsequently, Committee Member Wu Jingheng reported on the significance of Premier Sun Yat-sen completing the National Revolution in thirty years. After the meeting, President Chiang held a tea party to host party, government, and military officials and expressed his views, stating in brief that when the party swore in troops for the Northern Expedition, relying on the struggle and sacrifice of all officers, soldiers, and compatriots, it was able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and unify the country. The purpose of the Northern Expedition was not only to defeat Beiping, but also to solve China's problems and seek China's freedom and equality. Looking back thirteen years, our material and strength were far inferior to the Northern Warlords, and there were even those who lacked revolutionary awareness and attempted to hinder the Northern Expedition by any means. However, the proposition of the Northern Expedition was finally realized because revolutionary comrades had a clear understanding of the doctrine, so they were able to fight forward without fear of difficulties, and all obstacles were finally destroyed one by one. Revolution lies entirely in spirit and faith. If one has a spirit of great fearlessness and strong confidence, one will succeed no matter what difficulties are encountered. Today, as we commemorate the Northern Expedition Swearing-In, we recall the heroic sacrifices of the officers, soldiers, and compatriots at that time, which are as vivid as if they were happening right before our eyes. We can only strengthen our resolve and fight forward to complete the full success of the revolution, so as not to be ashamed of the responsibility of those who come after us. History is the most credible lesson, and only history can serve as our guide to struggle. By comparing the past with the present, we will be able to follow the same course to achieve our goals. (9th)

(Guiyang) Various circles in Guizhou held a Northern Expedition Swearing-In Anniversary rally this morning and paid tribute to the fallen soldiers in various revolutionary battles. Over 500 people participated, and the atmosphere was solemn and tragic. (9th)

A certain place in northern Jiangsu: After Huaian was attacked by Chinese troops on the 2nd, they set fire to Japanese strongholds in the city, cut off all roads, and engaged in street fighting with Japanese troops. The situation is still deadlocked. The county seat of Lianshui was attacked again and engaged in street fighting with Japanese troops for two days and nights. Seven to eight hundred Japanese troops and over ten tanks and armored vehicles coming from Huaiyin were intercepted by Chinese troops at Qi'an Yangzhuang and other places. The Japanese army suffered over a hundred casualties. Later, due to the Japanese army's fierce momentum, they broke through and counterattacked the Chinese forces. The Chinese army resisted bravely, and the fighting was even more intense. Brigade Commander Song personally entered Lianshui city to command, but suffered heavy casualties due to the heavy Japanese artillery fire. On the evening of the 2nd, he reluctantly withdrew, shifting his forces to the outskirts of the city to defend. (8th)

### Nomonhan War Intensifies; Small Hill Northwest of Hulun Becomes Target of Struggle; Soviet Artillery Accurate; Japanese Aircraft Conduct Frenzied Bombing

Manchuria-Mongolia Front: The Nomonhan war continues, intensifying. The small hill of Nomonhan is the target of attack by both Mongolian and Japanese forces. The scope of the war is similar to the Zhanggufeng Incident last summer. Both sides are currently using aircraft, tanks, and heavy artillery to desperately compete for this small hill 160 miles northwest of Hulun. The summit of the hill remains a no-man's land. Mongolian troops are holding firm to the western end of the hill under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire. A small group of Mongolian troops, under heavy Japanese artillery fire, forcibly crossed the Khalkhyn Gol River and are now rapidly advancing to reinforce friendly forces guarding below the hill of Nomonhan. Near the bend of the Khalkhyn Gol River is a lower hill called Nuolu (transliteration) Highland, which is said to have been surrounded by Japanese troops. Trench warfare has now developed. Both sides have dug trenches and are holding their ground. The impression obtained by the reporter is that the Japanese army's earlier expectations of taking advantage of their victory and continuing to win have not been realized due to the Mongolian counterattack. Although the Mongolian army has suffered many losses due to Japanese bombardment, it has been able to use the bridges across the Khalkhyn Gol River, using the darkness as cover, to send reinforcements to the front line to assist 4,000 friendly forces in danger of being surrounded by the Japanese army. Japanese troops coming from the north and from Haruna Mountain (transliteration) are now planning to encircle these 4,000 Mongolian troops. Haruna Mountain is at the southernmost end of the front line and is the terminus of the Changchun-Haruna Mountain railway. The reporter saw several cars of wounded soldiers today, proving the intensity of the fighting. This kind of fierce battle will be prolonged due to the arrival of new Soviet troops. Senior Japanese military officers recently declared that 60,000 Soviet troops from the Baikal region have now arrived and are stationed in the areas behind the front line. The rumor that the Soviet Union is planning to conduct activities in other border areas to contain the Japanese army is not worth taking seriously, they said. The Japanese army initially achieved victory, but progress has been slow, reportedly due to transportation difficulties and a lack of mechanized units. It is now understood that mechanized units are being reinforced, and at the same time, infantry strength is also being increased. There are two prominent features in this war. One is the accuracy of the Soviet artillery and the other is the bombing conducted by Japanese aircraft. According to the Japanese side, since the start of the war, they have destroyed 250 Mongolian tanks and armored cars and captured about 60 Soviet prisoners. However, the reporter was unable to personally confirm these numbers due to transportation difficulties in the frontline area. (8th, Reuters Special Correspondent)

Frontline Dispatch: Last night, in a heavy thunderstorm, the Japanese army broke through the Mongolian army's outposts. The Soviet-Mongolian army retreated westward. At dawn, the Japanese right wing had secured a strong position one mile from Hailar. The left wing, composed of a mixed organization of "Manchukuo" Inner Mongolian and Japanese troops, was three miles from the city, with Hailar as its bowstring. It is now believed that the 2,000-odd Mongolian troops who are still fighting bravely in the area may complete their retreat tonight due to the Japanese victory, as their only retreat route is a bridge that has been repeatedly bombed by the Japanese during the day. According to a Japanese military spokesman, once the Soviet-Mongolian army withdraws and the Japanese army recovers all the territory east of Hailar, they will stop their actions. The Japanese army has no intention of invading Mongolian territory, he said. At the same time, Soviet artillery is currently bombarding the Japanese army with accurate fire, causing the final stage of the advance to be delayed. At present, the confluence of the Kerulen and Khalkhyn Gol rivers is under direct Japanese surveillance, as they are slowly advancing despite being threatened by heavy Soviet artillery fire. This Japanese decision has been quite rewarding, and 60 prisoners have been captured and sent to the frontline reception center. It is said that more are continuing to be sent. The reporter spoke with two of the twenty prisoners and learned that they were captured by Japanese tank teams. One was an infantryman, aged 20, and the other was a member of the labor team attached to a certain artillery division, aged 25. Both had only recently joined the war and had only arrived at the front line 24 hours before being captured. According to the infantryman, he was transferred from Ulaanbaatar to the front line and was completely unaware of the destination or the reason for the deployment. He was not even told that there was a war, he said. The member of the labor team said that he enlisted in May and was immediately sent to Mongolia. The reporter witnessed many coffins wrapped in white cloth, containing the bodies of White Russian soldiers killed in action, being transported to Hailar for burial. Later, the reporter met with a certain Japanese air force authority, who said that the main reason for the great victory of the Japanese aircraft was the superiority of the Japanese pilots and the poor maneuverability of the Soviet aircraft. Although many enemy aircraft were shot down within Manchuria, it was not worth the risk to search for the wreckage of each aircraft in order to verify the accuracy of the figures released by the Japanese side, as all areas were under artillery bombardment, he said. According to the Japanese side, the total number of enemy aircraft completely destroyed is 400, which is actually more than twice the original strength of the Outer Mongolian air force. The reporter witnessed one destroyed aircraft, which was said to be an SB bomber. However, because there was very little left of the wreckage of the aircraft, its identity could not be confirmed. The reporter asked where the most fighting had occurred. The reply was that most of the fighting occurred over Lake Buir, but at present, it is impossible to travel there by land due to heavy rain and desolation. The spokesman also said that the altitude at which both sides flew during the fighting was between 12,000 and 15,000 feet. Japanese pilots were often able to fight selflessly in intense battles. Some of the Soviet aircraft were TKB or fighter planes with speeds of 370 to 490 miles per hour. (8th, Reuters Special Correspondent)

Frontline Dispatch: Yesterday, 40 Soviet aircraft bombed Manchuria in two batches, one place 40 kilometers from Hailar and the other 6 kilometers from the city. Most of the bombs fell on vacant land, and the area suffered no damage. After dropping their bombs, the aircraft flew back. It is said that the real purpose of the Soviets' hasty bombing was to divert the Japanese army's attention so that the retreating Soviet-Mongolian army could avoid being bombed by Japanese aircraft.

British Newspaper Commentary: Future of Aggressor Nation Bleak; The Deeper Japan Advances, the Greater the Difficulties; Has Fallen into a Dilemma

(London) The third year of the Sino-Japanese war began today. The Sunday Times recently published a commentary, saying: "China is emulating Russia's approach to Napoleon, implementing a 'scorched earth policy,' so that the victors gain very little. The casualties in this war are unprecedented in history. In addition to those killed in battle and ordinary people who have been tragically bombed by Japanese aircraft, the number of people who have died from famine, floods, and epidemics is in the millions. However, as of now, there is no hope for peace. On the Chinese side, what is seen is far-sighted, knowing the advantage of gaining time. Therefore, although they have suffered greatly, they have not succumbed. Looking back at Japan, its future is becoming increasingly bleak. As the country is clearly an aggressor, the atrocities committed by its soldiers have caused everyone within China to be hostile to it. Therefore, morally speaking, Japan has no place to stand. The deeper it advances in the future, the greater its difficulties. In a word, it has actually fallen into a dilemma. It is not surprising that the impatient people of that country, in despair, want to expand the scope of the conflict to cover up their failure, and are ignorant of blaming themselves, only knowing to vent their anger on Britain and other countries."

### National Government Revises and Promulgates Wartime Excess Profits Tax; Collected by the Income Tax Bureau

(Chongqing) The National Government today announced a new tax, named the Wartime Excess Profits Tax. Its regulations stipulate that this new tax is to be paid in addition to income tax. All commercial and industrial enterprises invested in by the government, privately, or jointly, with capital exceeding 2,000 yuan, whose profits exceed 20% of the capital, are required to pay this new tax. Profits from rent or property income that exceed 15% of the property value are also subject to this new tax. The tax should be considered a central government tax and collected by the Income Tax Bureau. The collection of the new tax should be calculated from January 1 of this year and paid annually or monthly according to the nature of the profits. The tax rate is determined by the ratio of profits to capital. Profits reaching 20% to 25% of the capital will be taxed at 10%. Profits from 25% to 30% will be taxed at 15%. 30% to 40% will be taxed at 20%. 45% to 50% will be taxed at 30%. 50% to 60% will be taxed at 40%. Above 60% will be taxed at 50%. (9th, Reuters)

(Chongqing) The regulations for the Wartime Excess Profits Tax, created this year, have been re-revised and promulgated by the Chinese government today, stipulating (1) that all commercial enterprises, whether semi-official or private, with capital exceeding 2,000 yuan and profits exceeding 20%, are subject to it; (2) that rents exceeding 15% are also subject to taxation; (3) that the income tax is fully applicable to wartime excess profits. The purpose of this tax is purely to prevent bribery for those who seek to enjoy large profits by taking advantage of extraordinary times. (9th, Associated Press)
