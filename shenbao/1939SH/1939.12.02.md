### Thirteen Soviet Planes Bomb Finnish Capital, Many Fires Erupt, Army Attacks on Three Fronts, Finnish Resistance is Strong, Several Warships Shell Ports on North and South Coasts

Helsinki: It is reported from here that the Soviet Union has delivered an ultimatum to Finland, stating that unless Finland accepts all of its demands today, the Soviet Union will destroy Finland. This morning, thirteen Soviet planes dropped bombs on the southern suburbs of Helsinki, but the people of Helsinki are very calm. Bombs dropped on the Helsinki airfield landed about 400 yards from the office, causing little damage. Civilians in the city are evacuating in a calm and orderly manner, without any sign of distress. Women gathered at designated locations and were transported by streetcars and cars. Parliament adjourned late last night after meeting until after midnight. A portion of the border has indeed been occupied by the Red Army. It is widely believed that the Soviet Union intends to land troops at several points on the coast. (Reuters, 1st)

Helsinki: An alarm was issued in this city at 2:10 PM today. Half an hour later, seven Soviet planes appeared over the city, dropping dozens of incendiary bombs, causing many civilian casualties. A second wave of nine Soviet planes then arrived to bomb the city, causing many houses to be hit and burned, with many casualties. The number has not yet been determined. Military sources claim that a total of four Soviet planes were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, two near the city, one on Hanko Island, and another in the Karelian Isthmus. In addition, the port of Turku issued an air raid alert at 11:40 AM today. A group of Soviet planes then arrived to bomb the port, causing heavy damage. A hospital was also affected. (Havas, 30th)

About twenty bombs fell on the northern part of the city, one of which was very large, causing thick smoke when it hit the ground. Soviet planes encountered fierce anti-aircraft fire. It is reported that one Soviet plane was hit, caught fire, and crashed. The air raid alarm sounded again late tonight. (Reuters, 30th)

Helsinki: Soviet troops attacked on three fronts yesterday. The main front is in the Karelian Isthmus, which is where Finland has its most fortified defenses. The second front is north of Lake Ladoga, bypassing the Karelian Isthmus on both sides, targeting the cities of Imbilatti and Dadafala. The area is forested with thick snow. Finnish troops are putting up a strong resistance. The third front is at the northern end of the border between Finland and the Soviet Union. Soviet troops have occupied the Rybachy Peninsula, which is located on the coast of the Arctic Ocean, with a harsh climate, barren land, and poor communication.

### Chamberlain Expresses Regret Over Soviet Actions

London: British Prime Minister Chamberlain responded to a question from Labour MP Attlee in the House of Commons yesterday regarding the Soviet attack on Finland, saying that the British government deeply regretted that a small, independent country had once again been attacked, causing suffering and loss of life to innocent people. There was no need to resort to force in the Soviet-Finnish issue, so the British government welcomed the mediation proposal made by U.S. Secretary of State Hull. The Soviet and Finnish sides had been exchanging views for some time regarding strategic issues raised by the Soviet Union concerning the proximity of the Finnish border to Leningrad. (Laughter from the audience.) The two places are about 200 miles apart, and the Soviet Union has proposed that Finland give up a portion of its border in exchange for land to the north. The Soviet Union also wants to acquire Finnish islands in the Finnish Gulf and Finnish ports at the mouth of the Gulf in order to consolidate the Soviet Union's position in the Gulf of Finland. It is reported that the Soviet Union has also demanded Finnish territory in the Patteri Peninsula that controls Petsamo, Finland's only Arctic Ocean port. The Finnish government has never adopted a provocative attitude from beginning to end. (Cheers from the audience.) However, it holds a determination not to yield and damage its sovereignty. Before diplomatic relations were broken, the note delivered by Finland to Moscow was worded extremely moderately. In this note, Finland proposed that the issue be submitted to arbitration and agreed to withdraw troops from the Finnish border in the Karelian Isthmus, leaving only ordinary border guards and tax officials. However, on Tuesday night, the Soviet Union unilaterally abrogated the Soviet-Finnish non-aggression treaty, which clearly stipulated that all disputes such as those that had occurred would be resolved peacefully. The British government is deeply concerned about this development. The British government finds it difficult to believe that the scope and importance of the military plans adopted by the Soviet Union are necessary to protect the Soviet Union from a small country like Finland. Last night, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov broadcast, denying that the Soviet Union intended to attack Finland, as reported by foreign newspapers. However, within a few hours, Soviet troops were reported to have invaded Finnish territory at several points on the border and dropped incendiary bombs on airfields near Helsinki. Shortly afterwards, Helsinki and Vyborg were bombed, causing some casualties. Attlee said that the Soviet attack on Finland seemed to be an act of unprovoked aggression, which was indefensible. He asked whether the British government had received any communication from the Soviet side explaining this action. Chamberlain replied that it had not. (Reuters, 30th)

London: Labour MP Dalton stated last night during a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons that the Labour Party had met and concluded that a strong country had committed an act of aggression against a small, democratic country in the Soviet-Finnish situation. The Labour Party was particularly dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's rejection of the U.S. mediation proposal. (Reuters, 1st)

### French Newspapers Condemn

Paris: French newspapers unanimously condemned the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, considering it another shameful act. (Reuters, 1st)

### Nordic Countries Sympathetic to Finland

Oslo: Regarding the Soviet Union's attack on Finland, crowds gathered in front of the newspaper offices here last night to await news, and did not disperse until late at night. Many university students and young workers formed groups and sang the national anthems of Finland and Norway in front of the Finnish Embassy. Some of them planned to hold a demonstration in front of the Soviet Embassy, but were stopped by the police. Newspapers here expressed sympathy for Finland. All the windows of the Communist Party newspaper office were smashed by the crowd. (Havas, 1st)

Copenhagen: More than one hundred Danish volunteers have automatically joined the Finnish Foreign Legion, willing to assist the Finnish army in combat. Finnish officials have not made any comment on this. (Haitong, 1st)

Stockholm: Swedish diplomatic officials told a correspondent of the Haitong News Agency last night that Sweden and Norway currently do not intend to assist Finland, because although both countries sympathize with Finland's plight, from a military point of view, neither country can fight against the Soviet Union. If Soviet military actions extend to other Scandinavian countries, then Sweden and Norway will resist with force. The Swedish King had previously stated this point at the Nordic Conference. If the Soviet Union attacks Sweden itself, then Sweden will participate in the Soviet-Finnish war. The general observation here is that the Soviet Union may be satisfied after meeting its demands on Finland, and will not take further action against Sweden and Norway. (Haitong, 1st)

Amsterdam: The entire Netherlands is indignant at the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland. Yesterday, when the news of the Soviet invasion was announced, the windows of a Dutch Communist Party office here were smashed by the crowd. (Reuters, 1st)

### Soviet Union's Attack on Finland Likely Difficult to Drive Straight Through, Finnish People Strong-Willed, Able to Defend from Strong Positions

London: A Reuters military correspondent reports that although the Soviet army invading Finland is superior in numbers and quality to the defending army, the Red Army will find it difficult to drive straight through a country of lakes and dense forests defended by 600,000 knowledgeable patriots. Most of the Finnish reservists are veterans. The Finns are a strong and hard-working people, known for their athleticism. This physique, combined with industry and a determination to defend themselves, has earned them the admiration of the United States. The fact that Finland has not yet paid off all its war debts to the United States is insignificant compared to the Finns' character and values. One-third of the Finnish army is made up of women's units, similar to the British Women's Auxiliary Defence Corps. Dressed in gray uniforms, they are responsible for cooking and nursing. Although the Soviet Union has announced that it has no intention of occupying Finland, how will the Soviet Union be able to force this kind of physically and mentally sound nation to accept its wishes? Other commentators say that the main defense against aggression from the east is the "Mannerheim Line," Finland's "Maginot Line." Mannerheim is a famous Finnish general. The terrain of Finland helps engineers build a powerful line of defense. Forests that remain green in winter protect their barracks and training grounds, which cannot be seen from the sky. Some areas have lakes and dangerous swamps interspersed, which do not need to be fortified. The ground is covered with granite boulders, which serve as obstacles to defend against tanks. Some areas have cleverly placed electrified barbed wire. In addition, the Finns have dug wide trenches. The Finns have used the special advantages of their terrain to set up various gun positions and large fortifications. (Reuters, 1st)

Editorial

### The Problem of Internal Transport and Export of Goods

Since the ban on internal transport of products from occupied areas has been discussed, the question of whether the Shanghai concession should be included in the occupied area has arisen. The transport of goods from the interior to Shanghai has also sometimes been banned under the name of "aiding the enemy." Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life gather, and it is the hub of China and foreign countries, with a complex situation and a special environment. Therefore, its position is more subtle than the occupied areas surrounding the Shanghai concession, and it is also very different from the regions under the complete control of Free China. Therefore, when talking about Shanghai today, there is no need to ask what its position is, but instead to reflect on the origins of the ban on internal transport. Is it because the government is hindering the movement of industry and commerce, or is it a method of cracking down on those who are willing to be accomplices of the enemy? It is indeed the treacherous and greedy who forget their righteousness that have promoted this situation.

The economic situation in the occupied areas is bleak and declining. Only the daily necessities of life exist in industry and commerce. This is the result of the invaders' past burning, looting, and massacre, and also violates their original intention of exploiting and oppressing in order to support the war with war. Therefore, although they threaten and entice people to cooperate, in reality, those who love themselves are unwilling to cooperate with them, and local thugs cannot cooperate with them. When their ambitions are revealed, they again use the name of control to carry out the reality of seizing property, and all sources of profit are taken for themselves. Although the Chinese people knew about the scorched earth policy, they did not have time to implement it at that time, or could not bear to implement it, and those who did not have time to withdraw, the remaining means of production were mostly reused. They call their factories Chinese factories, and their goods Chinese goods, but the capital and resources are not. Even goods brought by sea are rebranded and called national factories and national goods to cater to the Chinese people's preferences. Those who are used and become their pawns appear to be Chinese businessmen. Compared with those who would rather be jade broken than tile complete, who, because their factories and land have fallen and their goods are exhausted, would rather change to other industries and be upright, cannot be counted. Just as the waters of the Jing and Wei rivers flow differently, and the odors of sweet herbs and wormwood are different, they cannot be mixed. If, because of sanctions, the loyal and good people cannot express their feelings, then it is because right and wrong are not clear, rewards and punishments are not fair, patriots are discouraged, and villains are triumphant, which is not the way to encourage good people. Therefore, strictly preventing disguised and deceptive commodities from entering the interior to fuel the fierce flames of economic aggression is a necessary measure from China's point of view. What should be paid attention to is that we must first conduct a thorough investigation and careful review. If there is no sign of counterfeiting or imitation, and there is reliable proof of everything, including the amount of production and sales, the actual situation of receipts and payments, and the source and destination, and there is no suspicion, and they can comply with the laws and regulations, they should still be allowed to flow into the interior. They should also be announced in the newspaper so that everyone can see and hear. If the name and reality do not match, someone will surely rise up to correct the wrong. In this way, the needs of the people in the interior will not be lacking, and mixed sales can also be eliminated.

As for the products exported from the interior, the main point is to prevent them from aiding the enemy, and in fact, it is for the sake of the livelihood and economy of the people in the interior, which is also to enrich the strength of the war of resistance. Therefore, products that can be exported and can be exchanged for wealth should not only not be prevented from flowing out, but should also be given assistance. As for what is called aiding the enemy, it should be limited to (1) those that can enrich their military use, and (2) those that can enrich their financial resources. In addition, all consumer goods for the people in the occupied areas are on the list of permissible exports. It is hoped that although the land is occupied temporarily by military force and has become an occupied area, the residents in the area, although temporarily losing their support, can still obtain living materials. This is better than drinking poison to quench thirst. The people in the interior are the backbone of the war of resistance, and the products of the interior are the resources of the war of resistance. We should cultivate them even more, and how can we bear to add any setbacks? Now, the major products of the interior are also on the list of unified control. Since it is called unified control, the power should be unified, and the laws and regulations should also be unified. If the power is not unified, there will inevitably be overlapping agencies, or there may be the responsibility to handle things, but not the power to handle them; or there may be the power to handle things, but it will open the door to competition. As a result, merchants are frustrated and goods are abandoned on the ground, which is not appropriate. If the laws and regulations are not unified, then right and wrong will be inconsistent, and it will be difficult to find a standard. The executors will suffer from the complexity and have nowhere to go, and the followers will suffer from hesitation and be punished at every turn, which is also not appropriate. All actions during wartime must be unified and agile. Sluggishness is really the medium of harm. Because China has a vast territory, the laws and regulations come from the central government, but the responsibility for their success lies with the local governments. Therefore, we must strive to streamline the administration, eliminate what is inconvenient for the people, and implement what is beneficial to the people. Only by maintaining internal and external ties and using them well can the country and the merchants achieve a win-win situation.

### Roosevelt Appeals to Soviet Union and Finland Not to Bomb Unfortified Cities, Deeply Saddened by International Worship of Force, Ambassador to Soviet Union Mediates to Promote Negotiations

Washington: President Roosevelt's telegram to the heads of state of Finland and the Soviet Union reads in part: "In recent years, hostilities have occurred in many parts of the world. Areas where ordinary people live have often been barbarously bombed by planes, and men, women, and children who are unable to defend themselves have been either bombed to death or crippled, numbering in the tens of thousands. This is deeply hated by civilized people. The conscience of all mankind has also been shaken by it. As these tragic wars are underway, if this barbaric method of warfare is adopted, then the number of innocent people who are harmed will be in the tens of thousands. Previously, I had issued an appeal to the governments of all countries engaged in large-scale warfare. Now, I am specifically following the previous example and requesting your government to publicly declare that it will not allow its troops to bomb ordinary people and unfortified cities under any circumstances. The only condition reserved is that the other side must do the same." (Havas, 1st)

Washington: President Roosevelt formally stated today when meeting with reporters that the United States was deeply shocked by the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland. This move has endangered the right to self-governance of mankind. All nations should unanimously condemn this new means of using force to arbitrate international disputes. The policy of force is still spreading, and acts of barbarous disregard for the law are still taking place, which is distressing. The Finnish people and government have long had a record of complete peace and have earned the admiration and deep concern of the American people and government. When asked whether the United States' neutrality law could be implemented in the Soviet-Finnish conflict, President Roosevelt did not comment. When asked whether the U.S. government was considering withdrawing recognition of the Soviet Union, President Roosevelt also refused to answer. (Reuters, 1st)

Helsinki: The main task of the new cabinet is naturally the issue of reopening negotiations with the Soviet Union. Embassies in the Soviet Union are extremely active. Representatives of the U.S. Embassy and representatives of the Finnish government held several meetings in Moscow. It is reported that U.S. Ambassador Steinhardt warned Molotov that if the Soviet government refused to negotiate with the Finnish government, the United States would terminate Soviet-American trade and sever diplomatic relations. (Haitong, 1st)

Washington: After a meeting of the U.S. State Department, Secretary of State Hull accompanied Finnish Minister to the U.S. Procope to the White House to meet with President Roosevelt. The Finnish Minister and President Roosevelt had a long conversation. It is claimed that the Finnish Minister had a long-distance telephone conversation with the Finnish government before going to the White House to meet with the U.S. President, and there was some consultation. The U.S. government has not yet issued an official announcement of the U.S. President's meeting with the Finnish Minister. The Finnish Minister refused to comment to reporters after resigning, but solemnly stated that the Finnish government had not yet declared war, and only declared martial law in the country. However, the Finnish President has the special power to declare war when necessary. When reporters asked whether the Soviet actions could be regarded as military actions, the Finnish Minister replied, "I cannot say." (Haitong, 1st)

Washington: Foreign observers here recently commented that American public opinion is more resentful of the Soviet Union than it was of Germany when Poland was invaded. The U.S. government, under the influence, may take diplomatic action in the near future. Former Republican President Hoover has given a speech in San Francisco, saying that the invasion of Finland is the reappearance of the old concepts and massacres of the Genghis Khan era. "Civilization has fallen to its lowest level. The day the Communist Party attacked Finland was also a tragic day for all intelligent and virtuous men and women in the world." On the other hand, the tone of the newspapers is also extremely angry. The Democratic "New York Times" stated that "the loser is not Finland, but the Russian Revolution. The remaining respect of the world for the Soviet government will be completely lost due to the wanton trampling of Finland." The Republican "New York Tribune" stated that "the American people are determined to maintain their peace within the scope permitted by safety. But they must also accept the truth. The evil forces promoted by Germany and the Soviet Union in the world have threatened the democratic Europe and also endangered the civilized world. Even if the United States wants to stay away from the war zone, it is morally obligated to the world and should condemn the crimes committed by the all-powerful countries against the defenseless and peaceful nations with a deep sense of disgust." (Havas, 1st)

### President Roosevelt Receives Finnish Envoy; Soviet Violent Aggression Unanimously Condemned by Public Opinion

Washington - President Roosevelt, after returning to the capital from Warm Springs yesterday, immediately summoned Secretary of State Hull to discuss the situation in Finland. The discussion lasted a long time. Regarding the response after the American note was delivered to the Soviet government, nothing is yet known here. Political figures believe that Moscow will not reply in the short term. (1st, Huitong Telegraph)

### White House Convenes Meeting to Discuss Policy Towards the Soviet Union; Calls for Severing Relations with the Soviet Union Grow Louder; Situation in the Far East Must Also Be Considered

Washington - According to news last night, President Roosevelt may convene leaders of both houses of Congress at the White House today to discuss American foreign policy. Policy towards the Soviet Union will be the focus of discussion. According to news from Congressional leaders last night, the United States will implement a retaliatory policy against the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland and sever relations with the Soviet Union. Government officials believe that the current situation in Finland is extremely serious. However, there is no official opinion expressed regarding the proposal by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman and other senators to review and study US-Soviet relations due to the dramatic changes in the European situation. Secretary of State Hull does not wish to express any opinion on the Soviet-Finnish dispute within 24 hours after the United States issued a note to the Soviet Union and Finland expressing its willingness to mediate. Utah Democratic Senator King publicly stated last night that the United States must immediately sever relations with the Soviet Union. He said, "The United States should no longer shake hands with Stalin's bloody hands. The Soviet Union is a barbaric, semi-civilized area ruled by thugs and those who destroy freedom and democracy." (1st, United Press)

Washington - All sectors of American society share deep indignation over the Soviet Union's attack on Finland. Members of Congress were greatly shocked to learn that Soviet aircraft had bombed many Finnish cities. Many members of Congress plan to introduce a bill when Congress reconvenes in January next year, advocating the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The reasons given are that the debt owed to the United States by the Russian Kerensky Provisional Government has not yet been resolved, and the businesses formerly operated by American citizens in Russia have been confiscated by the Soviet government without compensation. It is noted that when the United States and the Soviet Union re-established diplomatic relations in 1933, the United States originally intended to make the settlement of past debts a prerequisite, but later dropped the matter. It has not been resolved to this day, which can be used as a pretext. Republican Senator Vandenberg also issued a statement saying that the events in Poland and Finland have occurred one after another. For the sake of the United States, the only reasonable way is to prevent National Socialism and Communism from gaining a foothold in the country. In addition, the attitude of diplomatic circles is more moderate. It is said that the Far East issue has become acute due to the impending expiration of the US-Japan trade agreement. If the United States severs diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, it may make it easier for the Soviet Union and Japan to get closer, and the Far East issue will become more difficult to resolve. On the other hand, political figures say that if the United States' attitude towards Japan is too tough, it may cause the Soviet Union and Japan to sign a treaty similar to the German-Soviet agreement. The impact of this would be that Japan would be more active in excluding Western countries in China. The Soviet Union would also use the pretext of fighting against democratic countries and imperialism to assist Japan, which must also be guarded against. In summary, if the United States severs diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and imposes economic sanctions, it seems to be welcomed by public opinion. There is a high possibility that the American ambassador to the Soviet Union will be recalled. However, the impact of this move on the Far East issue will definitely be taken into account by the State Department. (1st, Havas Telegraph)

### Will American Neutrality Law Apply to the Soviet Union and Finland? Announcement Expected Soon

Washington - The American "Dow Jones News Service" stated that there is a possibility that the United States will apply the provisions of the Neutrality Law to both the Soviet Union and Finland. When Secretary of State Hull was asked about this, Hull did not express his opinion, but said that he would announce it later and would not immediately explain the reasons for the American decision. (30th, Reuters)

### Finnish Foreign Minister Broadcasts to the United States

Helsinki - Foreign Minister Erkko delivered a broadcast speech to the American people yesterday, saying, "There is a great power that has always maintained good neighborly relations with our country and has signed a non-aggression treaty with us. Now it is sending troops to attack our border positions and attacking our undefended cities and hospitals, and carrying out military actions against our country. The government of that country has repeatedly acknowledged that it does not need to worry about us, and we have never threatened it, and have tried our best to ensure the security of the city of Leningrad, which can be clearly demonstrated by our suggestion to withdraw border troops to a considerable distance. Subsequently, we proposed that a third country act as mediator. Although all of this has been rejected, we have exhausted all means to avoid conflict and can declare our innocence to the world. The great American nation has done much for the small democratic country of Finland, and we are extremely grateful. Now we turn to you to express our respect." (1st, Havas Telegraph)

### Telephone Communication Between American and Finnish Capitals Interrupted

Washington - Telephone communication between here and the Finnish capital was reportedly interrupted this morning at 7:00 AM (Central Time) due to air raid alarms and bomb explosions. (1st, Reuters)

### Berlin's Attitude Undecided; Growing Anxiety About the Expansion of Soviet Power

Berlin - Regarding the question raised by foreign journalists about what stance Germany will take on the Soviet-Finnish dispute, the responsible party here replied yesterday that no reliable news from Finland has reached here. The news received from Finland, the Nordic countries, and Britain is one-sided and does not clarify the whole truth. Therefore, German officials must wait until they receive news from Moscow before they can determine their attitude. (1st, Huitong Telegraph)

Amsterdam - The "Electrical News" here received a Berlin telegram last night that had been approved by censors, stating that all sectors of German society expressed sympathy for the Finns and felt deeply anxious about the expansion of Soviet power in the Baltic Sea. The concessions that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had to give to Moscow in exchange for Soviet assistance are now gradually being revealed. Germany has sacrificed the Baltic countries, and the Soviet Union has further demanded actions in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Germany is unable to back down from this. The expansion of Soviet power is extremely dissatisfying to the German army and navy. The army has not forgotten the days when Germans and Finns fought side by side to restrain Russia and restore Finland's independence, and the navy is also anxious due to strategic reasons. (1st, Reuters)

### Soviet War Report

Moscow - At 2:00 AM on November 30, a Finnish troop crossed the Soviet border from the direction of Mansila Village and attacked the Red Army outpost in Kovkina Village on the north bank of Lake Ladoga. They were driven back into Finnish territory by the Soviets and suffered considerable losses. At 3:15 AM on the same night, someone fired machine guns at the Karelian Isthmus from the direction of Lasuri Village. Subsequently, a large Finnish infantry unit attacked Kokimaki Village. The result was also that they were repelled by the Soviet border guards. The Soviet army captured ten soldiers and one officer. At 4:00 AM on the same night, a Finnish infantry company attempted to attack the Soviet outpost in Temolovo Village in the Karelian Isthmus and was repelled by machine guns and rifles. The Soviet troops in the Leningrad Military District, in accordance with the order of the Red Army Headquarters, due to the continued armed provocations by the Finnish warlords, moved out at 8:00 AM on the 30th and crossed the border into Finland in the Karelian Isthmus and several other places. In the directions of Lipola and Polosuzlu, Red Army units have crossed the border and advanced 10 to 15 kilometers to the west. The Red Army attacking from Petrozavodsk has reached Lake Suchavi. In the Karelian Isthmus, the Red Army occupied the village of Metsapiiti and the Gokala Station and advanced towards the town of Terijoki. Soviet troops have captured many Finnish soldiers during their operations. The Soviet Air Force has conducted reconnaissance flights in adverse weather conditions and bombed airfields in Vyborg and Helsinki. (1st, TASS)

### Finnish War Report

Helsinki - The General Headquarters has just released its first war report, stating that Soviet troops crossed the border without following the proper declaration of war procedures and attacked our country in many places. They were all repelled. However, our army did not take the opportunity to attack Soviet territory. Our army also destroyed two Soviet tanks on Lake Ladoga. The capital city was bombed by Soviet aircraft several times today. Civilians were killed and injured, especially women and children. After the city of Tashi was bombed, four people died and thirteen were injured. Hango Island was also bombed, killing one person and injuring several others. In addition, the Soviet fleet bombarded our country's coastline. Nine residents of Vyborg Port died. The Cabinet held a secret meeting today to discuss the situation. (30th, Havas Telegraph)

### All Sectors of Chongqing Express Concern

Chongqing - Today, all Chinese newspapers here published the news of the Soviet invasion of Finland in large print. However, officials did not criticize the recent developments in Soviet-Finnish relations. The news of Soviet troops crossing into Finland only reached Chongqing late last night. Although it caused surprise and much discussion among the general public, the Chinese do not regard the Soviet invasion of Finland as unexpected. This is because people here believe that the tone of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech on November 29 already foreshadowed that the Soviet Union would take more active action. Although the Soviet-Finnish dispute has no direct relationship with China, the Chinese are quite concerned about the progress of this matter. Because China itself has suffered aggression, it expresses deep sympathy for Finland, which is fighting for freedom and independence. However, due to the current relationship of Soviet assistance to China's war of resistance, this sympathy cannot be expressed publicly. Since the European situation became increasingly tense, China has hoped that Britain and the Soviet Union would have close cooperation on international affairs. This hope has vanished with the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, the Soviet invasion of Poland, and the recent declaration by the Soviet Union officially denouncing Britain. China is currently eager to maintain relations with both Britain and the Soviet Union in order to obtain their assistance, so its position is extremely delicate. (2nd, Reuters)

### Chiang Wei-kuo Studies Air Force Training in the United States

Washington - Chiang Kai-shek's second son, General Chiang Wei-kuo, is currently studying air force training methods in the United States. He will soon go to Randolph Field to visit the training center and then go to other training centers for inspection before returning to his country to serve as the principal of the Central Aviation School.

### Britain and the United States Adopt Parallel Policies in the Far East; Do Not Believe That Japan and the Soviet Union Can Form an Important Agreement; Some British Politicians Advocate Compromise with Japan

London - Officials here strongly deny the unofficial threats made by Japan that it would seize British ships in retaliation for Britain's ban on the export of German goods. Britain's attitude is to adopt a parallel policy with the United States in the Far East. It is believed here that Japan will not conclude any important agreement with the Soviet Union. However, some British politicians advocate reaching an understanding with Japan as soon as possible to ensure that Japan maintains a cautious neutrality during the European war. (1st, United Press)

### Dong Xuchu Issues Letter to All People of Guangxi Province; As Long as the Military and Civilians Work Together, It Will Not Be Difficult to Annihilate the Japanese If They Advance Deeply

Guilin - Chairman Huang Xuchu issued a letter to the people of the province on the 30th, stating that the Japanese people, in order to complete their continental dream, did not expect that after two years of war, our entire country, from top to bottom, adhering to the Central Government's consistent national policy, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, would unite sincerely and resist unanimously. Our country is getting stronger and stronger as it fights, and the Japanese people's plans are failing. Recently, since the collapse of northern Hunan, in order to save the situation, they have attempted to deceive the international community and their domestic people and have had to make a desperate move by landing on the Qinzhou Fangcheng coast. Now their vanguard has approached Yongyi. Our province has always been known for its loyalty, and its customs are extremely brave. The grassroots organization of the militia has been praised by the whole country. Now that the Japanese people have invaded our homeland, if we do not give them a major blow, wouldn't it only make Chinese and foreigners disappointed in us? It is truly a disgrace to the people of Guangxi. We must teach our sons, warn our brothers, and respect our husbands, and work together to implement espionage reports, transportation, propaganda, and sabotage of Japanese telecommunications, roads, transportation lines, and disrupt the Japanese rear. Security, so that they are overwhelmed and unable to defend against everything. In all cities, towns, and villages, before the Japanese arrive, evacuate in advance, leaving nothing and no one to be used by the Japanese. We must do our best to rescue our wounded soldiers. All of this work should be done by our people. It must be known that the Japanese people have fought to this day and are already outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and there is nothing to fear. In the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Henan, etc., what we have lost are only cities and transportation strongholds. Even a village or a county cannot be completely controlled by the Japanese and still belongs to us. Such facts are seen and known by all Chinese people. Moreover, most of our province is mountainous, and the mechanical weapons that the Japanese rely on are inconvenient to use. As long as our people work sincerely and cooperate with the military, it will not be difficult to gather and annihilate the Japanese if they advance deeply. However, all of this is due to the bravery of the army, and at the same time depends on the efforts of the people. The victory in northern Hunan was achieved with the help of the people. It can be used as a clear sign. The current situation is related to the survival of the country and the nation. If we are temporarily at peace, we will suffer endless disasters for our children and grandchildren. Being able to endure temporary pain will surely give us the power to win the final victory. We hope that we will work together with one heart and one mind to go to the emergency, so that the military, politics, and villagers are closely related, united as one, and embrace the determination to sacrifice ourselves, and develop great fearlessness and loyalty to defend our homeland. Xuchu has a responsibility to defend the land and swears to dedicate himself to the party and the country. No matter how difficult it is, he will not hesitate to do so. He is willing to work together with all the fathers, brothers, sisters, and sisters in our province. (30th Telegraph)

### Smedley States China Will Certainly Win the War of Resistance; Japanese Troops Absolutely Incapable of Controlling Occupied Areas; Chinese People Have Overcome Various Difficulties

Laohekou - A reporter today visited Miss Agnes Smedley, the American female writer who arrived here from Anhui and Henan. Miss Smedley, dressed in military uniform, traveled thousands of miles. Her hard work, perseverance, and passion for China's War of Resistance were fully revealed in her travel-worn appearance. Miss Smedley, in her candid and earnest manner, made the following remarks to the reporter: Recently, I read the Shanghai correspondence of Mr. Aben in the New York Times, which stated that Japan had at least controlled half of China. At the same time, I also saw a map of the Japanese-occupied territories in China. This map, like Mr. Aben's article, is equally false. When I arrived in these areas, on the entire battlefield, apart from the Japanese troops having machine guns and artillery, there was fundamentally no talk of occupation. The areas that the Japanese troops occupy are only certain cities along the Yangtze River and the Jinpu or Huning Railway. Moreover, the Japanese troops in these occupied cities, such as Hefei in Anhui, are like prisoners awaiting execution, daring not venture out. Even in Anqing, which is heavily guarded by the Japanese troops, the Japanese are not safe because Chinese regular troops and guerrillas constantly sneak in and attack their camps. Apart from these few cities and transportation lines, most of the land is under the control of the National Government. I traveled thousands of miles from southern Anhui to northern Anhui, then to Henan, and finally to northern Hunan. Everywhere I went was the rear of the Japanese army, and the only Japanese I saw were prisoners being transported from the front lines. Farmers in most of this region are farming as usual, and schools are more well-equipped than before the war. Specially trained youth in Anhui are implementing the baojia system in various counties. Therefore, in small villages in Anhui, one can often see trained young men and women serving as village leaders. At the same time, they are also instructors for local self-defense and political work groups, as well as schools. I also visited training schools for thousands of security zone cadres and trained youth who graduated from middle school and are engaged in political work in local guerrilla units. I can absolutely testify that the various points occupied by the Japanese troops are constantly being intercepted, and their front lines are fundamentally unstable. The Japanese troops are also unable to control the Yangtze River. Only a few troops occupy large cities along the river. Japanese ships can pass up and down, but they are often sunk by Chinese troops. The Japanese claim that they have already controlled the Yangtze River is merely self-deception. However, the health and medical relief of the ordinary people are particularly important issues. My general impression is that China has made considerable progress in politics and military affairs, but progress in industry and medicine is relatively slow. Although China has these unresolved problems, the final victory will ultimately belong to China because China will certainly overcome these difficulties. Before the Japanese troops can conquer China and occupy half of China, the Chinese people have a profound and universal spirit of resistance because the Chinese people all know that the policies implemented by the Japanese are aimed at destroying China and the nation. The political conspiracy of Japan and its puppets to enslave China today cannot deceive the eyes and ears of people at home and abroad. (29th dispatch)

### Butler Reports in the House of Commons on Britain's Wartime Diplomacy; Efforts to Maintain Good Relations with Neutral Countries; Britain and France Cooperate Fully and Cannot Be Separated by Germany

London - Dalton of the Labour Party spoke in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that the preservation of European civilization depends on close and continued cooperation between Britain and France. I am not exaggerating when I say this. (Cheers from the crowd) The establishment of closer economic cooperation between Britain and France than ever before is most welcome. I still hope that this will be the starting point for a larger-scale plan that other countries can participate in. The British government should now consult with France and the Dominions to consider the nature of the Allied powers' peace objectives as soon as possible so that when the war ends earlier than expected, they will not be unprepared for the construction of a lasting peace. Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement on Wednesday that the future peace should not be based on conditions of retaliation is commendable. We should make the German people understand that after the end of the war, we want to see a free and civilized Germany occupying a position in a free and civilized Europe with the qualifications of a good and equal neighbor. There is a growing movement within Germany that could bring the Nazi regime and its bloody tools, namely the secret police, to an end sooner than we expect. (1st Reuter's dispatch)

### French Chamber of Deputies Passes Full Powers Bill; Extended Until End of War

Paris - After reconvening today, Premier Daladier immediately introduced the Wartime Full Powers Bill, requesting that the full powers enjoyed by the government (which expired today) be extended until the end of the war. After the bill was reviewed and passed by the Military Committee, the Finance Committee proposed a counter-proposal, arguing that all administrative decrees issued by the government should be submitted to Parliament for ratification within one month. This was opposed by Premier Daladier, who slightly amended the original bill as follows: "If the government issues various administrative decrees during Parliament's session, it should submit them to Parliament for ratification within one month; otherwise, it should submit them for ratification after Parliament reconvenes." The Chamber of Deputies then rejected the Finance Committee's counter-proposal by a vote of 309 to 189 and passed the government's proposal. From then on, the government can enjoy full powers during the war and use administrative decrees to take all important decisions regarding all operational matters. (30th Havas dispatch)

### Plans to Improve Education for Border Residents in Xikang

Kangding - Since the establishment of the Xikang Provincial Government, Chairman Liu Wenhui has worked with the Department of Education to plan and implement education with great effort. However, in the remote mountainous areas of Ning District and in the counties formerly under the jurisdiction of Kang District, due to the special local circumstances, the curriculum, teaching materials, teacher salaries, and equipment have not yet reached perfection. Recently, Chairman Liu received instructions from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, urging him to actively plan and promote the expansion of various educational programs and to increase the budget. However, in the Kang District, there is a language barrier and deep-rooted Buddhism. In the Ning District, the tribes live far apart and are naturally fierce. To achieve universal education, it is necessary to first change their orientation and establish good customs. A plan to improve education for border residents has now been drafted, along with the budget for the 29th year of the Republic (1940), with total educational expenses for the year estimated at over 3 million yuan. It is currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Military Affairs Commission for approval. (30th dispatch)

### Chinese Troops Occupy Advantageous Position on Northern Hubei Battlefield; Impressions of a Central News Agency Reporter's Inspection of the Front Lines

Nanyang - The reporter traveled through the Dabie Mountains to Jun County, the northernmost front line in Hubei, and then to various places near the Tongbai Mountains, covering a distance of hundreds of miles and spending half a month. I only returned here from the Tongbai Mountains yesterday. The observations I gained can be summarized as follows: (1) The strategic importance of the Dabie and Tongbai Mountains is indeed two strong fortresses on the Henan-Hubei battlefield, and the strong morale of the soldiers and the people is undoubtedly an unshakable Great Wall. Both mountains are rich in resources. In an agricultural society, they can be economically self-sufficient. Farmers, workers, and merchants are all working hard in production, and the order is exceptionally stable. Bandits have now disappeared. The organization of the masses is widespread. Military and civilians cooperate like family members, helping each other, and supporting each other in times of illness. Their strength is growing daily, and there is nothing to worry about any eventuality. (2) The places the reporter passed through have been ravaged by the enemy in the past. Although it has been several months, the scars are still visible everywhere. Not only are there broken walls and rubble everywhere, but even pigs, sheep, chickens, and dogs are rare. Less than 10% of the houses remain, and most of the residents are still operating under thatched sheds, and the condition of the refugees is extremely pitiful. However, their determination to resist the enemy is extremely firm. Under the relief of the local authorities, they are all able to make a living, either as small traders or as laborers assisting the army. The results are very good. (3) The Japanese troops on the northern Hubei front line are threatened by the Chinese army everywhere. They are now relying solely on fortifications, trapped in their strongholds, fearing Chinese attacks, and firing blindly from time to time. The Chinese troops are a hundred times more courageous, one against ten. The cowardly Japanese troops flee at the sight of Chinese bayonets raised high. The Chinese troops are becoming more and more courageous, and the Japanese combat power is becoming weaker and weaker. There is irrefutable evidence everywhere. (4) Looking at the current situation on the northern Hubei battlefield, the Chinese army is indeed in an advantageous position, and the Japanese are in a disadvantageous position. In the future, they can only be passively defending, concentrating all their efforts to protect their rear transportation and prevent Chinese attacks. (30th dispatch)

### Japanese Troops Invading Yongning Will Be Surrounded and Annihilated by Chinese Troops; Following the Japanese Troops' Crossing of the Shiwan Mountains, the Tragedy of Northern Hunan Is Set to Repeat

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese troops invading southern Guangdong, after landing at Longmen and Qisha, continued to capture Qin County and Fangcheng, and launched a large-scale invasion of Guangxi Province. Their objective is Yongning, which is purely a military operation, completely different from the purely economic operation of occupying Chaozhou and Shantou. At the beginning of the Japanese landing, a spokesman for the Japanese military headquarters falsely claimed that it was to strengthen the blockade of the South China coast, with the intention of diverting Chinese attention to benefit their attack. This is evident from the direction of their actions, with the main force attacking Qin County and Fangcheng instead of Beihai. Qin County is closer to Yongning and has the Qin-Yong Highway connecting them. Currently, the Japanese aggression is aimed at saving every ounce of strength. If they forcefully occupy Beihai, it would have little military value and would require dispersing their forces, giving the Chinese an opportunity to exploit. According to intelligence, the number of Japanese troops landing at Qin and Fang has been increasing, reaching over 10,000. However, the Shiwan Mountains stretch for over a thousand miles between Guangdong and Guangxi, and the terrain is treacherous. The Chinese army has already deployed defenses in all the strategic locations. In the future, after the Japanese troops penetrate deep, they will be surrounded and subjected to fierce attacks from all sides, causing the tragedy of the Japanese defeat in northern Hunan to be re-enacted between Guangdong and Guangxi. The following is a record of the war news received:

The Fall of Fangcheng and Qinzhou

On the 15th, under the cover of intense fire from warships, the Japanese troops gained a foothold at Qisha and Longdou. By evening, their numbers had continued to increase. On the morning of the 16th, over 2,000 people had gathered at Qisha, and 2,000 to 3,000 at Longmen. With the assistance of multiple aircraft, they launched an offensive into the interior. Troops from certain divisions of the Chinese army, in coordination with local militias, fought bravely. The fighting was very fierce. By noon, the Japanese troops had suffered hundreds of casualties. They became enraged and fully utilized the advantage of their mechanized infantry to intensify the pressure on the Chinese army. The Chinese army also persevered and worked closely with the civilian self-defense teams, holding their positions. At about 3 p.m., a unit of the Japanese army desperately broke through to the outskirts of Fangcheng. At the same time, over ten Japanese aircraft took turns bombing the city, destroying all the large buildings in the city and causing fires to break out everywhere, with many civilians killed and everything turned to ashes. At this time, the Japanese reinforcements poured in like a tide. Since the county town had been turned into ruins with no value to defend, the Chinese army transferred to a more advantageous area to continue the war. After the Japanese army entered the city, they committed all kinds of atrocities. However, most of the civilians had been evacuated in advance, and all supplies had been destroyed. As for Qin County, on the afternoon of the same day, over a hundred Japanese cavalrymen charged into the city, engaging in fierce street fighting with the Chinese army. They were surrounded by the Chinese army and, without reinforcements, were completely annihilated by the Chinese army. The situation became more stable. In the evening, the Japanese army, not daring to launch a large-scale offensive due to the unfavorable terrain, only shelled the city with artillery throughout the night. At dawn on the 17th, the Japanese army made a large-scale movement, with over 2,000 cavalry, artillery, and infantry launching a fierce attack on the county town in three routes. Multiple Japanese aircraft went even more insane in their attacks. The Chinese troops and civilians resisted at every stage. However, due to the vast disparity in numbers, they retreated to a certain area. After the county town fell into the hands of the Japanese army, the burning and killing were extremely brutal. By noon, the Japanese army stationed a small number of troops in the suburbs and the rest advanced north along the Qin-Yong Highway.

Vietnam on Alert to Defend Against Japanese Troops

Vietnam borders Fangcheng. Dongxing, a district of Fangcheng, and Mangjie, a district of Vietnam, are separated by only a bridge. Previously, the Vietnamese government, in order to strengthen its defense in response to the outbreak of the European War, had imposed strict security measures at the Sino-French border and restricted the entry of people. Later, as the European situation entered a stalemate, it announced the lifting of martial law. Now, the French government, due to the sudden invasion of Fangcheng by the Japanese army, the serious situation, and the fact that the Japanese army is unreasonable and disregards international law, making it difficult to guarantee that they will not cause trouble, has re-imposed emergency security measures on the Sino-French border. Large numbers of French soldiers and Annamite troops are actively deploying defenses in the Mangjie area, building massive sandbag fortifications and maintaining strict vigilance. The inspection of passing pedestrians is extremely serious. A large number of refugees have fled into Mangjie. However, since the relations between China and France have always been friendly, they have not been hindered.

The Port of Beihai Has Not Yet Fallen

As of recently, Beihai is still in Chinese hands. Along the coast of Guantouling, Dijiao, and Nanhuan, six or seven Japanese warships are often gathered. Since attempting to land once on the morning of the 15th, they have not attacked again. They only frequently fire artillery at the coast to create a diversion. The Chinese defenders have doubled their guard. Deng Shizeng, the administrative commissioner and security commander of the Eighth District, is stationed in a certain area, mobilizing the people to participate in the war of resistance. The residents of Beihai have been forcibly evacuated. All military structures have also been prepared for destruction if necessary. There are over twenty foreign nationals from Britain, France, the United States, and Germany in Beihai. Under the orders of the local authorities, they have all evacuated. Only one American missionary remains in the city. The German nationals have all transferred to Guangxi Province due to the European War. The remaining foreign nationals have taken the route through Lianjiang and Suixi, passing through Guangzhou Bay to Hong Kong. Goods exported from Guangxi and southern Guangdong were originally exported through Beihai and Guangzhou Bay. Now, due to the outbreak of war in the Beihai area, it is impossible to navigate, so everything is concentrated for export through Guangzhou Bay. A large number of refugees are also fleeing into Guangzhou Bay, making it very crowded.

### Soaring Prices in Sichuan Province: The Plight of the Poor Intensifies, Driven by Speculation in Oil and Rice

Chengdu Dispatch: Since late October, commodity prices in Sichuan Province, excluding remote counties, have surged dramatically. The situation is particularly dire in Chongqing, Chengdu, and the counties along the Chengdu-Chongqing highway. Among the goods, daily necessities such as oil, rice, firewood, charcoal, and pork have seen the most significant price increases. This situation has become a pressing issue, causing widespread hardship among the poor. Even primary school teachers, with their meager salaries, are feeling the pinch. The primary reason for the soaring prices is the sudden increase in the prices of rapeseed oil and rice. The increase in rapeseed oil prices is mainly attributed to unscrupulous merchants manipulating rapeseed supplies through hoarding and speculation. Increased demand is only one factor. The main market for oil and rice in western Sichuan is Xindu. To suppress oil and rice prices, the Sichuan Provincial Government has dispatched officials to Xindu to investigate the amount of rapeseed and oil stored in warehouses, register and manage them, strictly prohibit speculative trading, and prevent manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. The Department of Civil Affairs will also convene representatives from the government and business sectors of Chengdu, Xindu, Huayang, and the three counties, as well as oil and rice merchants in Chengdu, to discuss fundamental solutions. In Chengdu, the municipal government has been managing the North and South Rice Markets since the 17th. For rapeseed and rapeseed oil transactions, buyers, sellers, brokers, and whether the buyer is an oil merchant and the purpose of purchasing rapeseed is for oil extraction must be declared in detail by all three parties. At the same time, the municipal government dispatches personnel to conduct secret investigations to prevent manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. The Municipal Price Evaluation Committee held a meeting at the municipal government on the 18th, and representatives from the Oil, Rice, and Money Trade Associations also attended to jointly discuss ways to stabilize oil and rice prices, thereby regulating overall commodity prices.

### North Jiangsu Chinese Army Attacks Jingjiang as Japanese and Puppet Troops Collapse

Taixian Correspondence: Han Deqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu, recently appointed He Keqian as Commander-in-Chief of the ×× War Zone. He led the ×× Battalion to advance towards Rugao County, defeating the Japanese army in Chaiwan. The fighting is now progressing to Rugao County, and has been fierce in recent days. At the same time, cadres from the ×× Regiment stormed into Jijiashi and Tangjiazha, also engaging in street fighting. Although the Japanese army in Jijiashi had built strong fortifications, they gradually retreated eastward after being attacked by the Chinese army. Jijiashi and Tangjiazha were subsequently recovered by the Chinese army. At Gushan Town in Jingjiang County, a joint Japanese-puppet force of 60-70 men was surrounded by the ×× Battalion of the Chinese army on the Gushan mountaintop fortress. The Chinese army from Jijiashi and Tangjiazha also advanced rapidly towards Jingjiang County along small paths and are currently joining the attack.

### Ministry of Education Improves Social Education Plan (2) Promoting Broadcasting and Film Education; Editing and Reviewing Popular Reading Materials

(C) Promoting Electrified Education with Film and Broadcasting: Film and broadcasting are powerful tools for implementing social education, capable of covering the largest space in the shortest time and exerting the greatest force with the least amount of material. Since the autumn of the 25th year, the Ministry of Education has been actively promoting these tools, and significant progress has been made in the past two years. However, given the vast territory of our country and the uneven distribution of facilities, continued efforts are urgently needed in the future to complete the broadcasting education network as soon as possible. The installation of radios should be increased so that every township or joint security group has radio equipment to listen to educational broadcasts on time. In addition, the number of mobile film education service zones should be increased annually so that every county and city has a set of film education equipment to conduct mobile teaching in the villages and towns within its jurisdiction. The methods are as follows:

(1) Measures to Complete the Broadcasting Education Network: A. The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should complete the organization of the Broadcasting Education Service Office within their own departments and bureaus and comprehensively plan the promotion of broadcasting education. B. Each province and city should divide the entire province or city into several broadcasting education guidance zones based on administrative inspectorates or the guidance area of the provincial public education hall, establish a Broadcasting Education Service Office in each zone, and appoint a full-time broadcasting instructor under the guidance of the broadcasting education service office of the provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus to handle the supervision of broadcasting education, guidance and consultation on radio technology, and the repair and inspection of radio equipment.

C. If each province has already established a public education hall in each administrative inspectorate commissioner's area, the affairs of the broadcasting education guidance zone can be managed by the provincial public education hall.

D. At the central level, the Ministry of Education will contact the Central Broadcasting Administration and the Central Propaganda Department, as well as the relevant departments of the Ministry of Communications, to jointly formulate a plan for adding radios in counties and cities in the rear area, and assist local governments in installing radios.

E. Schools at all levels, public education halls, and larger public schools in each county and city should make every effort to install radios and make full use of them so that nearby people can directly or indirectly receive broadcasting education.

F. Other educational institutions and local autonomous organizations and public groups should also do their best to install radios and establish contact with other radio institutions to jointly promote broadcasting education.

G. To supply power to the radios, each province should establish small-scale dry battery manufacturing plants. H. If provinces, counties, and cities utilize holidays to conduct training classes for social education personnel and primary and secondary school teachers, "Management and Use of Radios" should be included as a compulsory course.

G. Each province, county, and city should include broadcasting education expenses in the social education budget. H. Omitted.

(2) Measures to Expand Film Education: A. Each provincial and municipal education department and bureau should establish a film education service office to comprehensively plan the promotion of film education in the province. If funding and personnel are insufficient, the broadcasting education service office and the film education service office can be merged to establish an Electrified Education Service Office.

B. Within the 28th year, each province should establish a mobile film education service zone in each administrative inspectorate area. The office (or communication office) of the zone should be located in the office of the administrative inspectorate commissioner of the area, and the counties directly under the area should be the scope of mobile teaching. Subsequently, the teaching area should be gradually reduced each year, and the number of teaching areas should be increased, with the goal of completing the desire to establish a film education teaching area in each county within a year.

C. If each province has already established a provincial public education hall in each administrative inspectorate commissioner's area, the affairs of the mobile film education service zone can be managed by the provincial public education hall.

D. Each mobile teaching zone should be equipped with a generator and a projector. The equipment will be fully or partially subsidized by the Ministry for provinces to receive. Starting from the 28th year, for provinces receiving half subsidy, an additional equipment fee of 800 yuan should be raised for each additional teaching zone established. Each province should add a slide projector and a sound machine to each established teaching zone from the 28th year onwards. E. The educational films shown in each provincial film education mobile teaching zone will still be supplied by the Ministry on a regular basis as a principle. Starting from the 28th year, each province should establish its own educational film library to purchase and produce films related to history, geography, customs, and specialized industrial and agricultural education to enhance national consciousness.

F. Each province should include the recurring expenses of the film education mobile teaching zone in the social education budget.

G. The Ministry's Electrified Education Personnel Training Class has film education and broadcasting education groups, whose main goal is to train film and broadcasting education technicians for each province. The Ministry will continue to hold these classes every year, and each province should send a corresponding number of candidates according to the number of film teaching zones and broadcasting education guidance zones added, so as to avoid the feeling of a lack of talent when additional zones are established.

### The Puppet Municipal Government Forcibly Collecting Donations from Residents on Yuyuan Road; Dares Not Collect from Foreigners; The Exact Amount of Donations Collected is Not Announced

According to the "Zi Lin Bao", donation collectors from the "Shanghai Municipal Government Finance Bureau" began collecting "house donations" on Yuyuan Road in the outer road area yesterday (30th). According to the "Bureau" officials yesterday morning, the donation collection was not difficult, and there were quite a few residents who paid donations. However, the exact amount of donations collected was not announced. The "Municipal Government" now believes that the outer road area is under its management, but it will not collect house donations from foreign residents, shop owners, and managers in the area, as negotiations on this issue are still pending. "Finance Bureau" collectors, accompanied by municipal police, have gone to the Yuyuan Road area to collect donations, and those who refuse to pay donations will be detained. The amount of donations is calculated based on the rent rate, with shops at 11% and residents at 9%, according to the announcement. Donation collectors have been collecting donations in other outer roads for more than a day, but only went to Yuyuan Road yesterday. Many foreigners reside on the road, but no collectors have collected "winter house donations" from them. According to Jiangwan "officials", the collection of house donations was announced many weeks ago, but it was delayed. Then it was announced that foreigners were also included in the donation list. Although negotiations on the outer roads issue are still ongoing, the "Municipal Government" has actually begun collecting donations for the first time. According to the "New Shen Bao", since the establishment of the "West District Collection Office" in March of last year, the work of collecting "house donations" has been proceeding smoothly, but residents living in the outer road area and relying on the protection of the Shanghai Municipal Council have refused to pay, which is a violation of the law. Although one or two residents have voluntarily paid, the number is very small. "Director" Zhou was not satisfied and ordered the West District Office to begin collecting in the outer road area of ​​western Shanghai as well.

### Japanese Detaining Chinese Police Intended to Intimidate

Two Chinese police officers "tried" in a puppet court: Two Chinese police officers from the Public Concession were performing their duties on Robert Road on the 19th of last month when they had a conflict with a puppet member and were detained by the Japanese military police. Although Major Bowen, Chief Inspector of the Police, made a serious protest to the Japanese, they have not been released. Foreign sources believe that the Japanese are detaining the two Chinese police officers to intimidate other Chinese police officers performing their duties. After the Chinese police officers were detained, the Japanese handed them over to the puppet "Shanghai West Branch of the District Court" on Zhongshan Road on the 24th for a "trial". It is now heard that they will be handed over to the newly established puppet "Shanghai West Branch of the District Court Office" at 92 Gsi Fei Road for further "trials". However, what "charges" will be brought against them are not yet known. The puppet "prosecutor" is a Mr. Liu.

### The Japanese Actively Obtaining Cigarette Business: Five Factories Established in Hongkou, with More Than Ten Brands

The Japanese are now trying to actively promote the cigarette industry in the war zone in order to replace the potential influence of Chinese and foreign merchants selling various brands of cigarettes in the Jiangnan area. According to investigations, there are five Japanese-owned cigarette factories that have opened in the Hongkou area one after another. The factory sites all belonged to Chinese merchants before the war. One is the Huasheng First Factory, located at Kunming Road, Baoding Road, Hongkou, which is the original site of the former Zhongyuan Cigarette Factory. One is the Huasheng Second Factory, located at Aierkaoke Road, Tangshan Road, which is the original site of the former Xinhua Cigarette Factory. One is the Huasheng Third Factory, located at Tangshan Road, Baoding Road, which is the former Zhengda Overshoe Factory (the machinery was moved from the former Nanyang Huacheng Second Factory). The three factories have a total of more than 2,000 Chinese workers. One is the Dongya Cigarette Factory, located at Baoding Road, Tangshan Road, which is the original site of the former Huadong Cigarette Factory. One is the Gongxing Cigarette Factory, located at Huacheng Road, Huade Road, which is the original site of the former Zhongnan Cigarette Factory. The two factories have a total of 1,600-1,700 Chinese workers. The new brand cigarettes produced by the above five factories, totaling more than ten kinds, are actively promoting sales in the occupied areas.

### British Troops Replacing, New Troops Arrived in Shanghai on the Desheng Ship; Part to Qinhuangdao

The Jardine Matheson Desheng ship, which came to Shanghai from Hong Kong this time, carries three teams of British troops, a hundred and fifty people, to Qinhuangdao to take over the defense by the original ship. After a part of them arrived in Shanghai, they landed and changed with a certain team of central army in Shanghai. After the ship unloads the goods, it is scheduled to transport the central army to Qinhuangdao today, so no goods are loaded in Shanghai.

### Japanese Spokesman Claims to Have Reached an Agreement with Wang: Says Wang Agreed Not to Withdraw Troops

Japanese Embassy spokesman Tsurumi Ken said at the press briefing yesterday afternoon that an agreement had been reached between the Japanese government and the head of the "New Central Political Power" in Jingwei on the basic procedures for economic cooperation. Japan has agreed to create a strong and independent government, while Wang has agreed that Japan will not withdraw its troops stationed in China.

The delay in the establishment of the "New Nanjing Government" is due to the ongoing strengthening of various necessary matters. There is a precedent for this, which can be used as an example. After the American Revolutionary War, the young democracy went through a difficult process before forming its government institutions.

Today's establishment of the "New Political Power" can be said to be in the same category. Regarding this point, an American commentator said last night that "the spokesman has obviously made an inappropriate analogy. The establishment of the American democratic country was through its own strength to resist the delusions of invaders, while the "New Central Political Power" relies on the support of the invaders. At the press briefing, foreign journalists also asked, "Wang has recently used wireless broadcasting to persuade the front-line generals of the Chinese army to abandon the National Government and join his command. Is there any response?"

A spokesman for the Japanese army rose to answer one: "There has been a response, but very small. There is a certain Feng, (probably referring to Huang Dawei) leading his 20,000-man army, willing to work for it." After being questioned, the spokesman replied, "I cannot disclose the location of Feng's activities, but I can tell you that Feng 'has the permission of the Japanese army' and is active outside the Japanese-occupied area."

### Valiant Chinese Troops Control Dianshan Lake; Japanese Army Suffers Defeat in Qingpu; Martial Law Declared in Zhujiajiao

After the 30th Division of the regular Chinese army and the 45th Brigade under Tian Xiushan joined forces on the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border, their momentum surged. Last month, they severely damaged more than 500 Japanese soldiers from Jiashan between Xitang (20 li northwest of Jiashan) and Taozhuang. Afterward, the Japanese retaliated with air power, destroying most of the houses in the kiln areas of Xitang, Huaqing, Tianningzhuang, Hongxi, and Dingdianmiao. The Chinese army then used a miraculous strategy to recover Xitang with the 45th Brigade, threatening the

Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway

line. The 30th Division advanced north, controlling the southeast bank of Dianshan Lake, and approached Zhangliantang and Zhujiajiao, which directly unsettled the Japanese troops in Songjiang and Qingpu counties, and indirectly threatened the southwest suburbs of Shanghai. The Japanese army then dispatched more than 300 troops from the Qingpu county garrison, along with reinforcements sent from Shanghai, and advanced southwest beyond Zhujiajiao. Three days ago, they came into contact with the Chinese army in the triangular area of

Ye She's Bank

on the shore of Dianshan Lake. The Chinese side held a superior force and had artillery support. The two sides fought fiercely, marking the second major battle since the Xitang campaign. The reports from foreign media about the fighting in the neighboring counties of the southwest suburbs of this city also originated from this. The rumbling of artillery fire could be clearly heard in the Qingpu and Zhujiajiao areas. The fierce battle lasted for a whole day and night. Due to heavy casualties, the Japanese army retreated to Qingpu county without achieving anything. During the battle, the local villagers

fled to seek refuge, and refugees were seen everywhere. Now, after being comforted by the Chinese military authorities, they have returned one after another. Currently, the Chinese military's influence continues to expand northeastward, so martial law should be imposed in the Qingpu and Zhujiajiao areas.

### Ministry's Response on Post Office Limiting Female Staff: Women Can Still Be Hired Within the Stipulated Scope

Various women's groups in Shanghai have repeatedly fought for the issue of the post office limiting the use of female postal workers. Yesterday, they received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Communications stating that, as it is now an extraordinary period, postal affairs are becoming increasingly heavy. Most of the existing female staff in various bureaus have already been assigned work, so it was necessary to temporarily impose restrictions on the recent recruitment of postal workers to meet current practical needs. However, various bureaus can still hire women within the stipulated scope to take into account the issue of women's employment. It is said that various women's groups are not satisfied with this measure and are continuing to fight for it.

### Over 20 Shanghai Factories' Cotton Cloth Shipped to the Philippines All Detained; Due to Large Quantities of Japanese Grey Cloth Being Transshipped from Shanghai to the Philippines for Mixed Sales

Recently, the Philippine authorities have been conducting very strict inspections on cotton cloth shipped from Shanghai. This is because the local Anti-Japanese Association reported that a large quantity of Japanese grey cloth was being transshipped from Shanghai to the Philippines for mixed sales. All cotton cloth from more than 20 dyeing and printing factories in Shanghai, including Hengfeng, Guoguang, Jiufeng, Yuanfeng, Daxinzhen, Gongsheng, Qianfeng, Guangzhong, Tongfeng, Zhongguo, Tiansheng, Yingzhou, Hongdachang, Yuxin, Zhongyi, Zhongguo, Jiuxin, Guoxin, Ronghua, Lunhua, Hengsheng, and Huadong, has now been detained. A valid certificate must be provided within 30 days before it can be considered for release. It is reported that the Export Merchants Association has sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to investigate and handle the matter. The Chamber of Commerce has first sent a telegram to the Chinese Consul-General in the Philippines, requesting a temporary suspension of the disposition during the investigation period.

### Continued Ordering of Tribute Rice; 200,000 Bags Transacted; Yesterday, the Desheng Transported Over 14,000 Bags; Rice Prices Are Rising More Than Falling, the Guild Plans to Suppress Them

Large batches of foreign rice continue to arrive in Shanghai, as reported earlier. It is now known that yesterday morning, the Jardine Matheson's Desheng arrived in Shanghai, also carrying a large batch of foreign rice from Hong Kong, totaling 14,717 bags. The ship docked at the Roosevelt Wharf on Xinkai River and is currently being unloaded.

Continued Ordering of Tribute Rice

200,000 Bags

Since the price of rice in the city has gradually increased, general firms and public places have been ordering from Saigon. The first batch of more than 20,000 bags arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and there are still many batches on the way to Shanghai. As the source of domestic rice in Shanghai is not smooth and is often obstructed, and the price does not fall, the Shanghai rice industry has requested the French merchant Daofu to order another 200,000 bags of tribute rice from Saigon to meet the food needs of the Shanghai people. It is reported that the transaction price of tribute rice is nearly 30 yuan per stone for each bag of 190 catties. The opening price in the market today is 35 yuan.

Continuous Supply

While tribute rice is continuously arriving in Shanghai and the transportation from various rice-producing areas is not interrupted, the price of rice in Shanghai not only does not fall but is rising day by day, which is suspected by the general public. The reporter of Da Zhong News Agency specially visited a certain gentleman in the rice industry for this reason. According to him, although procurement and transportation in the rice-producing areas in the occupied areas, such as Suzhou, Jiaxing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Kunshan, are difficult, they have not been completely interrupted. The average daily arrival is about 6,000 bags. As for Anqing and Wuhu, only the Japanese merchant Mitsui is allowed to purchase "military rice," and other merchants are generally not allowed to go there for procurement. Even if they have a procurement certificate, they are not allowed to transport it to Shanghai. However, the so-called "military rice" of Mitsui is actually 70% to 80% transported by Japanese merchants to the concession areas for sale. Therefore, the key to this abnormal surge in rice prices does not lie in the obstruction of the source, but in other factors.

Reasons for Price Increase

Still Hoarding

The price of rice in Shanghai is entirely determined by the Rice Market Management Committee based on the quantity of the source, but the real power of the Management Committee is controlled by the Marketing Guild and merchants. Before the war, the merchants in the market only bought and sold on behalf of customers, extracting a commission of 1.5 cents per stone. Moreover, with smooth transportation, they had no real power to manipulate the market price. Since the war, the situation has been reversed. After the successive fall of the rice-producing areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the daily arrivals can be predicted, so they can manipulate it with ease. There must be quite a few merchants who are benevolent and take the people's livelihood as the premise, but those who "only seek profit" are everywhere. For example, if each of the 100 merchants in Shanghai hoards 300 bags of rice, there will be 30,000 bags. All the arrivals are monopolized, and coupled with the hoarding of people outside the industry, how can the price of rice not soar day by day?

Guild Meeting

Contributing Opinions

The Shanghai Rice Industry Guild believes that the rising rice prices have a great impact on the people's livelihood. They all believe that if no effective measures are taken to suppress this rising trend, the consequences of following the trend and spreading will be unimaginable. Although the guild has no real power to set prices and curb this chaotic market, it can contribute opinions that may be adopted by the Management Committee. It is found that the time limit for purchasing rice in the market is ten days, and payment and delivery are due upon expiration. Therefore, within this ten-day period, the market price changes greatly. Generally, brokers and merchants often take the opportunity to hoard and manipulate. The guild specially held a meeting the day before yesterday to discuss remedial measures, intending to seek the consent of the soybean and rice industry and submit it to the Market Management Committee, requesting that the time limit be shortened immediately. After the time limit is shortened, brokers and merchants without real strength cannot hoard and manipulate, so this may be effective for a while.

### Yugoslav Nationals Celebrate National Day Yesterday

The English "China Press" reported that Yugoslav nationals in Shanghai celebrated National Day today (the 1st). According to this day 21 years ago, the Yugoslavs united to form a nation.

### Japanese Police Complete Training; Assignments Scheduled

The Public Concession Police commissioned the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in March of this year to recruit 27 Japanese patrol officers. After arriving in Shanghai, they were given six months of training. It is now completed, and starting from the 8th of this month, they will be formally assigned to serve in the Central Police Station and the Hongkou Police Station. It is also learned that the police recently planned to recruit another 20 Japanese police officers. There are about 2,000 applicants. The selection will be held on the 15th of this month at the Memorial Hall in Fukuoka City, Japan. The police will send a Japanese Assistant Superintendent and a Japanese Detective to supervise the examination.

### Second Batch of Fractional Currency Coupons to Be Issued; Procedures for Various Industries to Collect; Banks and Money Shops Can Collect Directly; Other Industries Can Exchange at Their Regular Banks

In order to fundamentally relieve the lack of small denomination currency, the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong requested the approval of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank to commission the American Yongning Company in Hong Kong to print a large number of 1-cent and 5-cent fractional currency coupons. They have already rushed to print them and will gradually deliver them to the Shanghai Branch for distribution starting from the 8th. All banks and money shops (members of the Bankers Association), as well as major companies and major stores, can prepare a letter to collect and exchange them from the bank. Other industries can collect them from their regular accounts (banks and money shops). However, small money shops and tobacco shops are temporarily suspended from supply. As for the substitute coupons of various companies, shops, and tram companies, they should be automatically withdrawn after the second batch of fractional currency is issued. Because the issuance of substitute coupons was not approved by the Ministry of Finance in advance, it cannot be considered legal.

If carrying any securities, they should be submitted to the Foreign Exchange Bureau for approval.

Permanent Residence

(D) Fourth type of traveler: Those who originally resided in Vietnam and want to permanently reside abroad. There are no express provisions in the law for this.

### Labor Dispute in the Leather Goods Industry; Application for Mediation by the Authorities; Notice to Workers to Wait for Resolution Quietly

The workers of various leather goods factories in the city, due to the current soaring prices and difficult living conditions, have, through the Leather Goods Workers Association, sent a letter to the capitalists, proposing three conditions, including the requirement to increase wages.

### Aluminum Coins of Public Buses Also Circulate in Hangzhou; Value of Aluminum Coins Issued Reaches 100,000 Yuan; But the Company Ultimately Failed to Recover the Original Coins; Additional Bus Routes Will Be Opened Next Year to Ease Passenger Flow

The "North-China Daily News" reported that the public bus companies in the city, in view of the lack of fractional currency, have issued substitute coupons of various denominations from 1 cent to 5 cents. The British-owned China General Omnibus Company purchased machinery at a huge cost to manufacture aluminum substitute coins of varying values to prevent the counterfeiting of substitute coupons. The company originally intended that these aluminum substitute coins could eventually be recovered

And melted into aluminum strips

For manufacturing public bus bodies and other light metal fittings, because the aluminum price of the substitute coins is probably not lower than the face value of the coins. However, to date, the value of aluminum coins issued has exceeded 100,000 yuan, and none have been recovered, and it is said that such aluminum coins are also circulating as far away as Hangzhou. The British-owned China General Omnibus Company continues to issue aluminum coins every day

About 30,000 pieces

When the conductors pay the company at night, they only see a few aluminum coins. The company is studying remedial measures in order to cooperate with the public as much as possible and must deal with the serious situation with new methods. If the issuance of aluminum coins continues, it will be necessary to purchase additional equipment and aluminum to meet the demand. The issue of issuing substitute coupons has also been discussed, but it is feared that counterfeiters will

Take advantage of the opportunity to profit

Therefore, it has not been implemented. Given the current situation, many public bus passengers do not buy tickets and get off the bus because the conductors do not have fractional currency to give change. The company is losing a lot of money as a result. It is hoped that the public will cooperate as much as possible and reduce the duties of the conductors. From next year onwards,

Route 16 Will Be Opened

A public bus, starting from Yichang Road, passing through Gordon Road, Xinzao Road, Carter Road, Avenue Edward VII, Datong Road, Burkill Road, Chengdu Road, Weihaiwei Road, and Race Course Road to Yu Qiaqing Road, will be operated by single-decker public buses to connect the northwest and central areas of the Public Concession and alleviate the acute public transport problem in the city.

### Promoting the Moral Rearmament Movement; First Day of Special Broadcasting; Explaining the Importance of Moral Rearmament

Yesterday was the first day of the broadcasting. Dr. Wang Wanbai and his family gave a detailed account on the Eastern Radio Station of the situation after

Moral Rearmament Within the Family

In the evening, the Education and Youth groups broadcast on the Gospel Radio Station. Professor Jin Wuzhou of Shanghai University and students from major middle schools in the city gave speeches in rotation. Based on their personal life experiences, they issued the importance of moral rearmament for education and youth, and their words were extremely pertinent. Here is a summary of the main points: "Currently," the emotions of young people in general are extremely enthusiastic, and everyone has great ambitions to transform society. Their purpose is good, but those who have never achieved significant results are because they excessively despise

Personal Morality

Although we want to transform today's bad society to seek human happiness, if personal morality is swept away, people will not believe what they say and do, and failure is inevitable. The purpose of moral rearmament is to rebuild the world and transform society, but it must start with the moral rearmament of the individual, removing corrupt habits, changing bad habits, and using the four principles of absolute honesty, absolute purity, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love as the criterion of life.

Practice What You Preach

Strive hard, and under God's management, change the whole world. Therefore, young people today must recognize the current difficulties, not rely on emotional impulses, but must know their mistakes and correct them, and extend themselves to others. And today's education must also take the training of moral talents as its responsibility and cultivate good young people as pioneers to open up new lands in the world. It is learned that the movement will continue to broadcast at the scheduled time today. Business figures and several doctors in the city will be the speakers. Ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life can tune in on time.

### Taikoo Company's Wulin Steamer Robbed in Qidong; All Cotton on Board Plundered; Both Sides Opened Fire, Two Bandits Shot; One Bandit Died, One Bandit Captured

Fully Loaded With Flower Clothes

Bags, sailed out of the port and approached the Wulin steamer. While loading was in progress, nearly 50 pirates, carrying four submachine guns and Mauser pistols and other new-style military weapons, took six sailing boats and chased out of Sanhe port, swarming to the side of the Wulin steamer, robbing the flower clothes and not allowing them to be loaded onto the ship. The British soldiers escorting the Wulin steamer opened fire to resist, and the pirate ships also

Opened fire in retaliation. The sound of gunfire was chaotic. As a result, the flower clothes on the six barges were finally plundered and taken away. Two pirates were shot and fell to the ground as they climbed onto the steamer.

As of the afternoon of today (the 1st), Shanghai has still not been able to obtain accurate details. It is only heard that after the pirates appeared, the Wulin steamer immediately sent out a wireless message, and a British gunboat received the message and

Rushed to the rescue. Several pirates were captured by the crew of the Wulin, and the remaining pirates escaped when the British gunboat was about to arrive.

### Volunteer Night School Teacher Xia Runsen Wrongfully Arrested and Humiliated, Sues Chen Guansheng for Deprivation of Liberty, Defendant Files Countersuit, Court Adjourns for Verdict

Xia Runsen, a local volunteer night school teacher at the New New Primary School at No. 429 Route Paul Beau, French Concession, retained lawyer Wang Shizong to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, suing Chen Guansheng (28 years old, from Shantou, Guangdong), the legal representative of the Baochang Money Exchange at No. 188 North Henan Road (now closed), for bringing bailiffs and detectives to the school and

Intentionally Ordering Arrest

Of an unrelated person, in a case of deprivation of liberty.

It is claimed that the defendant, in his capacity as the legal representative of Baochang Exchange, had filed a lawsuit against Xia Runlong in the Civil Division of the Court for rent arrears and eviction. After the execution proved ineffective, on the morning of October 27th at 9:00 AM, he brought bailiffs and detectives to the New New Primary School, falsely claiming that the plaintiff was Xia Runlong and ordering his arrest. The plaintiff protested, stating that he was Xia Runsen, Xia Runlong's younger brother, and that they were

Distinct Individuals

Who could not be confused. He presented his name card and personal seal, but all were in vain. The defendant claimed that detaining his brother would force the surrender of his brother. As a result, the plaintiff was wrongfully arrested and humiliated. When the execution court opened, the defendant insisted on his previous statement, demanding that the plaintiff be detained. Only after Wu Jizhen, the principal of the New New Primary School, presented the plaintiff's diploma and other documents was he released, having suffered half a day of

Detention and Escort

And the humiliation of the loss of freedom. Furthermore, Baochang Exchange had already ceased operations, and the owner was surnamed Zheng, and the manager was Chen Lizhou. The defendant was not an employee of Baochang Exchange. Moreover, Baochang Exchange had dealt with Xia Runlong for a long time and knew him well. The defendant's false accusation, calling a deer a horse, was an illegal insult and deprivation of liberty, a clear violation of Article 302 of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, the defendant

Solicits Lawsuits

For a living and has no fixed address. The plaintiff requests that he be arrested and prosecuted according to the law. The court accepted the complaint and, the day before yesterday, Judge Zhang Minsheng opened the trial. The defendant retained lawyer Qu Shiji to defend him and filed a counterclaim accusing the plaintiff of slander, property damage, and theft. After a detailed interrogation of both parties, the court adjourned for a verdict. The defendant Chen Guansheng was released on bail pending review.

### The Case of Chen Linshi's Death, Not Related to the Hospital, Chaozhou Hospital Implicated, Court Declares Innocence

The Chaozhou Heji Hospital was previously implicated in the case of a patient, Chen Linshi, who died shortly after being admitted. The French Concession police discovered that she had died of poisoning and detained a number of related witnesses to investigate, exhuming the body for examination. In addition to prosecuting Chen Agen, Xiao Yongshui, and Lin Zaokun, they also accused Hu Xianrong, an employee of the Chaozhou Heji Hospital, of knowingly failing to report the incident and assisting in the concealment of evidence, as well as violating police regulations, and filed a public prosecution with the Second Special District District Court. After a retrial, Judge Liao of the court announced the verdict yesterday, finding Hu Xianrong not guilty. The court found that when Chen Linshi arrived at the hospital for treatment, she was already beyond saving. The hospital, according to procedure, could not admit her and did not provide any treatment.

### Finance. Hong Kong Firms Absorb Large Quantities. Gold Prices Experience a Shocking Surge. High Point Reaches Four Thousand and Fifty Yuan. Underlying Trend Remains Strong After Closing. Trading Is Extremely Active.

Yesterday's cash bar market situation, following the previous night's surge, became even more intense, especially in the evening session when rumors spread that Hong Kong firms were transferring huge sums of money to purchase gold in the local market, causing gold prices to jump sharply. Buyers rushed into the market, pushing prices past the 4,000 yuan mark, with a high of 4,050 yuan. The momentum was truly astonishing. Most observers were optimistic that the high gold prices of a few months ago might be revisited. The morning opening was already high at 3,950 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan from the previous day. However, due to the overnight market, prices had already reached around 3,940 yuan outside the market. Subsequently, Hong Kong firms made further advances, rising another 20 yuan to 3,970 yuan. But retail investors were trading relatively calmly. The midday closing was only 3,942 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, in addition to the tightening of the foreign exchange market, news that Hong Kong firms were fiercely buying gold with huge sums of money led many retail investors to open new long positions and add to their holdings. Although some gold firms took profits, buyers outnumbered sellers, pushing prices past the 4,000 yuan mark to a high of 4,050 yuan. In the end, prices closed at 4,045 yuan, a significant increase of 120 yuan from the previous day. Trading was extremely active, with approximately 3,000 taels changing hands. Jewelry gold prices initially remained stable, but later surged by 10 yuan. Customs gold remained flat.

The Bar Market Also Jumps by Hundreds of Yuan

Since the morning, each lot (ten taels) initially showed lingering effects from the previous day. Hong Kong firms continued to commission money changers to buy on their behalf, and the opening price was 25 yuan higher. Securities firms bought 20 taels for gold firms at 3,950 yuan. In a flash, prices jumped another 20 yuan, with money changers buying 20 taels for jewelry firms at 3,970 yuan. At this time, the atmosphere was very heated. Suddenly, some gold firms seized the opportunity to take profits, while buyers from other regions lost interest, leading to a downward correction. Prices soon fell by 38 yuan, with money changers trading 30 taels at 3,932 yuan. Then, securities firms came to lift the market, and prices rose again by 13 yuan, with securities firms buying 30 taels from money changers at 3,945 yuan. Afterwards, jewelry firms and cash firms began to sell, leading to another decline of 15 yuan, with jewelry firms and cash firms selling a total of 50 taels to gold firms at 3,930 yuan. At that time, gold firms continued to buy on behalf of customers, while money changers came to the rescue, pulling prices up by 15 yuan. Money changers bought 20 taels from securities firms at 3,945 yuan. Later, retail investors sold, and prices fell slightly by 8 yuan, with money changers selling 10 taels to jewelry firms at 3,937 yuan. As noon approached, foreign exchange suddenly reported weakness, exciting the market. Money changers and some gold firms competed to absorb the supply, pushing prices up by 5 yuan, with gold firms buying 20 taels from money changers at 3,942 yuan, the midday closing price. It was reported that the underlying trend remained strong after the closing, with prices rising to 3,955 yuan. In the afternoon, prices continued to rise. The opening price rose to 3,960 yuan, and then jewelry firms came to buy, pushing prices up by another 10 yuan, with jewelry firms buying 20 taels from securities firms at 3,970 yuan. Then, some gold firms sold, causing a slight pullback of 15 yuan, with gold firms selling 10 taels to money changers at 3,955 yuan. Afterwards, foreign exchange suddenly reported tightening again, boosting confidence. Money changers and gold firms vigorously bought on behalf of Hong Kong firms, and sellers were scarce, causing prices to soar by 85 yuan, with gold firms buying 30 taels from securities firms at 4,040 yuan. Then, jewelry firms took profits, causing a pullback of 20 yuan, with jewelry firms selling 20 taels to gold firms at 4,020 yuan. Subsequently, money changers started buying again, absorbing over 300 taels. Although retail investors took the opportunity to sell, gold firms also had a good appetite, so prices were pulled up by another 30 yuan, with money changers buying 20 taels from jewelry firms at 4,050 yuan. Afterwards, some money changers sold slightly, causing a slight decline of 15 yuan, with money changers selling 20 taels to gold firms at 4,035 yuan. Finally, due to gold firms buying on behalf of Hong Kong firms again, prices were raised to 4,045 yuan at the closing. As a result, prices surged by another 120 yuan from the previous day. The underlying trend remained strong after the closing, with 4,055 yuan being hard to obtain. Throughout the day, there was a fluctuation of 120 yuan. The cash gold price sold by gold firms was 10 yuan higher than the bar price, while the buying price was 20 yuan lower. The current standard gold price was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed price, with few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Rises by 10 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael initially remained at 400 yuan at Dahong Bank. At 2:40 PM, prices were raised by 5 yuan, and at 3:45 PM, they were raised by another 5 yuan. As a result, Dahong Bank changed the price to 410 yuan. The prices at Xin Bank were the same, with buying prices reduced by 15 to 20 yuan.

However, after 11:00 AM, Hong Kong firms suddenly began selling large amounts of US dollars, estimated at around 250,000 yuan. But HSBC and Yooli banks were very keen to buy, so there was no impact. HSBC bought 200,000 yuan and Yooli absorbed 50,000 yuan, both at 7.8125 yuan.

Under these circumstances, factories are also actively purchasing. Shenxin No. 9 Mill released a large batch of cotton yarn the previous day, and yesterday supplemented with 1,300 bales of American cotton, which is cheaper than Indian cotton.

However, Japanese factory acceptance remains slow, while supply from Northern Jiangsu is smooth. 6,222 bales of Tong cotton arrived at the wharf, along with 921 bales of Changyu yarn and 4,680 bales of Beisha Dong.

Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose another 18 rupees. Egyptian cotton rose over 60 points, and Liverpool cotton rose 25 pence.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading: recently, all parties have focused on the soaring cotton market overseas, and cotton yarn has also been pulled up.

### Traffic Obstruction: Yarn Sales to South China Impeded, Raw Cotton Prices Rise

The yarn market is flat, but current yarn transport is not smooth. Sales to South China and [illegible] are slow due to transportation problems.

However, with the American cotton market rising steadily and showing no signs of stopping, which will inevitably lead to higher replacement costs, the yarn market should move forward. Unfortunately, sales are poor, so the pressure from [illegible] is strong. The amount of yarn released by Zhongxin No. 9 yesterday was 10,400 bales.

The current yarn market's morning sentiment is unanimously bullish, saying that with the soaring foreign cotton market, yarn prices should rise. Opening prices rose $4-5, with 20-count Shuangma priced at $677. As soon as this price was announced, buyers quickly [illegible], but actual demand remained weak, and prices soon fell again.

The market price of 20-count Shuang Kun was $4, Tiannv rose $2.50, and [illegible] Diqiu rose $1.

Inland: 130	Ningbo: 30	Total: 1,084

### Grains: Rice Weevils Stir Up Trouble, A Blow from Foreign Rice, Hoarders Immediately Retract Their Hands

After a brief tightening of the rice market, yesterday 20+ train cars of goods from Kunshan, Taicang, Suzhou, and Tongxiang arrived, boosting confidence further. Buyers, based on the previous day's situation, remained firm, creating an opportunity for speculators. From the opening, they sold their profitable goods at high prices, while simultaneously buying in low-priced goods. The situation quickly became chaotic, stirring up public sentiment. Everyone was hoping for good news, and they all followed the trend, scrambling to buy. As a result, merchants were able to sell, and the price of both Japonica and Indica rice rose by $1. At the same time, hoarders became increasingly interested, taking advantage of the high prices. Local shops thought that with the winter solstice approaching, it was time to stock up, fearing that the market would not fall back down under manipulation. They bought from each other, so by midday, prices rose even more, reaching about $2. As prices were soaring, the Beiyang gang, which owns a large amount of foreign rice, initially held their goods, observing.

The market was immediately hit, and most buyers, who were originally elated, were suddenly disappointed and no longer interested in buying. The speculators felt the pain, having expected unexpected profits. Now, they could only lament their misfortune. This was indeed the deserved outcome for those who manipulated the market. Therefore, the evening market suddenly weakened. According to the closing market, the early market rose sharply, with Japonica and Indica rice all rising by $1-2 compared to the previous market.

Buyers, following the previous day's upward trend, saw a strong increase at the opening. Brokers and hoarders were still greedy. The early market once rose by $1.3-5. Then, with new foreign rice transactions completed and deliveries expected soon, some profitable groups sold with the market, and the afternoon market began to fall back by $0.4-5. However, Gao Wu Xian rice still opened at $34.70, with few arrivals and sales. The total market only had over 2,000 bags.

The morning price of foreign rice rose sharply, with dealers continuing to buy, and the foreign exchange rate also impacting prices. Major buyers absorbed more rice. Saigon, Annam Japonica, and Siamese rice all opened at around $35 to $35.50. Then, with two new batches of transactions completed, the sharp morning increase of over $1 fell back by $0.4-5. According to reports, 500 tons were sold by Jianyuan yesterday at a price of $39.50. 600-700 tons were sold by Dafu, with No. 1 priced at $39 and No. 2 Saigon at $37.50.

### Flour Mill Prices Rise Another $0.20, Wheat Prices Reach $12.50

Flour prices have increased again. No. 2 boat (brand) prices have reached $7.80, up $0.20 from the previous day. Due to the turbulent times and frequent price increases, in addition to consistent activity to digest supply, hoarders are also accumulating in the market, boosting confidence. Sales are [illegible] increasing. Therefore, No. 2 flour [illegible] rose $0.20. Running cart [?] prices even opened above $8. Other flours from inland and Japanese factories, such as Fengli brand, also rose $0.1-2. Total sales were estimated at over 50,000 bags, with actual sales accounting for about half. The rest was speculative. Factories are paying close attention to this, so they are still [illegible] controlling the supply.

Wheat supply remains scarce. Due to frequent price increases from lower production areas, and with flour mill prices rising again, those holding goods are naturally waiting for higher prices and accumulating, unwilling to sell lightly. They are only willing to supply small amounts, so [illegible] procurement is difficult, and there is no large quantity available. As a result, it is difficult to purchase. However, there were five cars of transactions in the market, with Wuxi wheat priced at $12.4-7. Suzhou wheat even opened at $12.50, setting a new high price.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Soybeans Moved to South China, Sesame Factories and Hoarders are Eager

Yellow soybeans [illegible] maintain the market's sentiment and remain relatively strong. Market prices mostly continue to rise, and the overall situation has not yet declined.

Two cars of Bengbu soybeans were priced at $16. Over 100 bags of Chongming sand yellow were priced from $15.7 to 16. 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans were priced at $15.5. Two cars of Nanjing soybeans were priced from $15.3 to 5. Over 100 bags of Jiangbei soybeans were priced at $14.3.

Sesame [illegible] actual sales remain unchanged. Although trading is lively, it is entirely driven by the desire of hoarders. A total of 250 bags of Hankou sesame were traded, with prices close to the market price. 200 bags of Changzhou sesame, 100+ bags of Yangzhou sesame, 60 bags of Nanjing sesame, 50 bags of Guandian snow sesame, 50 bags of Anqing sesame, and 30 bags of Jiujiang sesame were traded.

### Sugar Market: Red Sugar Trading is Very Active

Yesterday, the sugar market [illegible] Dutch telegram reported an increase of 0.30, so the price of No. 1 crude white sugar was Dutch currency 11.75 O.L.F., so the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's market price shifted and tightened. Current cargo (No. 24 crude white sugar) at this warehouse was $52.5, new cargo at other warehouses was $53-53.5, old cargo was $51.5-52.5, and transit cargo was $42-42.5, all up $0.5. Taikoo's cube sugar rose fully. Dong Warehouse B was $54.5-55.5, West Warehouse was $55-55.5, the rest was Siamese, [Illegible] H was $38.5-39 for cart red, and Dutch red was $40.5-41.

The Geng gang offered 1,004 bags of Chong Dong Xiang at $34 [illegible], and the Xinghua gang offered 100 bags of Maige red at $39.7.

### Coal: Uniform Price for Coal Balls – Already High at $70

The coal ball business is normally a busy season in winter. This year, the local population has increased, and the demand is even greater. The total output of various large and small factories is 3,000-4,000 tons per day, which is still insufficient to distribute. The situation continues to be strong, and factory prices have mostly increased, recently reaching a uniform price. Starting December 1st, the same trade will sell a coal ball for $61 from the factory, and it will be $63 delivered. Customers will receive it for $66.

### Couple's Knowledge: Weak Men Will Find It Hard to be Husbands

To be a man, one must be strong and vigorous. The so-called "manly man" not only displays power in his career, making people recognize him as a dignified man, but also plans strategies and commands with ease. At the same time, women also adore this kind of great man. He is as hard as iron and as soft as cotton, with love as deep as the sea and happiness like a fairy tale. He is truly the master of women's hearts and the provider of spiritual nourishment. Only such a man is worthy of being called a real man and a great husband! Conversely, if a man is promiscuous in his youth, engaging in bad habits such as masturbation and homosexuality, or suffers from spermatorrhea and neglects treatment, or marries early and has many wives, indulging in excessive lust, depleting the endocrine fluids in his reproductive glands, he will inevitably suffer from premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, lack of offspring, brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, neurasthenia, and many other symptoms. These men often have an unattractive appearance, a sallow complexion, and a weak spirit. Or, they are strong on the outside but weak on the inside, becoming tired before labor, fearing cold and difficulty. This has a serious impact on their studies and careers, leading to failure. In the sexual lives of couples, they are also unable to achieve satisfaction, or even unable to perform at all. How can this not arouse hatred in the hearts of beautiful women and lead to the breakdown of love! Frankly speaking, marriage is a union based on sexual relations. A fulfilling sexual life can lay the foundation for love between couples. If sexual life is not harmonious or unfulfilled, it is better to have none at all. The quarrels and disputes between couples, or even tragedies such as adultery, elopement, separation, and divorce, often have underlying reasons related to sexual relations.

Weak men will find it difficult to be husbands! They may simply find it difficult to be a person! The complexities of the world and the weight of responsibility require energy to strive. Without energy, they will only be eliminated! However, weakness can be prevented and remedied. According to the latest medical research, the various weakness symptoms mentioned above can be treated with endocrine supplementation therapy to the reproductive glands, which can have a "rejuvenating" effect. The potent animal reproductive hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" extracts the endocrine essences from the reproductive glands of apes, bears, deer, sea dogs, and other animals based on this principle, and is made using scientific replication methods, preserving all the components. Therefore, it is of high quality and reliable efficacy, surpassing any similar preparation. After taking it, the essence is produced and the kidneys are replenished in one day and night, nourishing the brain and activating blood circulation. Continuous use promotes development, nourishes nerves, and the above symptoms can be completely cured within a month. Continuous use for a winter can increase body weight and prolong life. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can achieve the miraculous effect of returning to youth. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take the sperm-strengthening drug "Hymelt's Sperm Consolidating Pills" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage for even faster results! Those who can come to our clinic for new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections can be guaranteed a cure.

### Beauty: Breasts are Beautiful in Winter

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Some say that in winter, the word "beauty" has no meaning for women. This is not true. The beauty of women can be seen not only in the summer when clothing is light and the richness of the curves is evident, but also in the cold, harsh winter. A woman with a healthy and beautiful body not only has a rosy complexion and delicate skin, without any roughness or gray-white cracks, but also has two steamed bun-like breasts in front, rising high even when wearing thick clothing. At the same time, the buttocks are also plump and soft. The heavy clothing does not hinder their lovely curves. As for those who are thin and weak, suffering from menstrual problems, leucorrhea, anemia, malnutrition, and have had multiple pregnancies resulting in a loss of health, their breasts are withered and their beauty is lost. In this cold winter, they feel especially cold, and others see them as thin and pitiful! Even if their faces are covered with cosmetics, they will unceremoniously float up in this cold weather. Patches and spots still reveal the pale face underneath. Even if they are wearing a gorgeous cheongsam, their back is straight, and their chest is flatter than if ironed. Even old men know that they are not healthy and beautiful. Even if you use all your efforts to disguise, can you still wear thick clothes to cover this ugliness in the room after a bath? Moreover, when "a cold night descends and the golden curtains are lowered, and the lovers mimic double flying in the quilt," where will you escape? Therefore, "true gold fears no fire," and artifice will ultimately fail. The only reliable method is to take the ovarian endocrine preparation for women, "Sheng Zhi Su" during this time of supplementation. After taking it for a day, it can nourish the ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus, and stop leucorrhea. If you continue to take it for a season, not only will the withered breasts rise again, but also the tissue and sallow skin will become tender and delicate. The effect is so great that it cannot be compared with similar preparations on the market. Even ginseng, velvet antler, and pearl powder are not enough to compete with it for strengthening the body and maintaining beauty. Therefore, it is praised all over the world, and progressive women consider it to be their only benefactor of beauty.

### The Root Treatment of Spermatorrhea

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianhui

"For a seven-year illness, seek three years of moxa." This means that diseases must be treated fundamentally for the best results. If you only seek temporary and superficial effects, the disease will not be cured and will cause future problems! Most young people suffer from spermatorrhea due to behaviors such as masturbation, homosexuality, early marriage, and promiscuity, which damage the sexual nerves and loosen the sperm gate. Spermatorrhea caused by sexual stimulation in dreams at night is a mild form of nocturnal emission. If this is neglected, the drops will turn into a river, and the increasingly loose sperm gate may lead to spermatorrhea. Seminal fluid is physiologically the so-called reproductive gland endocrine fluid. Its components contain large amounts of precious substances such as the pituitary gland, adrenal gland, adrenal cortex, and testicular gland. If spermatorrhea is not stopped, it will not only directly damage vitality and damage reproductive function, but also affect development and reduce metabolism, leading to premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, lack of offspring, brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, and premature aging. These young people will inevitably be depressed. Students will fall behind in their studies and may even drop out of school! Those engaged in industry and commerce will find their jobs difficult to handle and may even lose their jobs! In addition, due to their unattractive appearance and sallow complexion, they are often abandoned by the opposite sex in social settings and hated by their wives in married life. The family tragedies and descents into the sea of suffering that result are countless! Therefore, it is imperative to seek radical treatment for spermatorrhea as early as possible. The only way to treat it is to take the world-famous medicine for spermatorrhea, "Hymelt's Sperm Consolidating Pills," which has a special effect of calming nerves and stopping spermatorrhea on the same night. This agent is secretly prepared by the German medical saint Dr. Hymelt and has the miraculous effect of consolidating the sperm gate and calming the nerves. People who take it will find it effective. However, with the prevalence of counterfeit and inferior drugs today, be sure to recognize the "Hymelt" mark when purchasing to avoid being confused and causing delays! Those who have had spermatorrhea for a long time and have the above-mentioned symptoms of loss must also take the potent animal reproductive gland preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to fundamentally nourish the brain and kidneys and increase essence and blood. Continuous use for a winter will surely cure all diseases, increase body weight, and prolong life. Patients who can come to our clinic for new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections can be guaranteed a cure.

### Research and Blind Obedience

— Xu Zhongjie

The Language Exhibition has closed. From a literary perspective, we believe that the most valuable exhibits there were the characters on the bronze ware, oracle bones, and black pottery. The application of oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions in researching new classical texts is indeed a new progress in the study of classics in the past three hundred years. Therefore, if this public solicitation and exhibition of language exhibitions can yield gains in the study of classics, it would be the greatest achievement in literature.

Here is some introductory knowledge about studying the classics.

Classics is the most difficult thing to study in any literary field. According to Mr. Wang Guowei, there are three reasons: First, errors and omissions. Second, ancient language is different from modern language. Third, idioms. From the Han Dynasty to the early Qing Dynasty, although "classics" was used as an important material in the process of academic research, they all took the wrong path in studying classics. The Han school focused on family traditions and teachers' sayings, and did not treat classics as a material for literary research; instead, they regarded it as incantations. When classics came into the hands of the Song school, they used classics to talk about their Neo-Confucianism; they explained classics based on a kind of ideal conjecture. Therefore, for thousands of years, although they read the classics enthusiastically, they were all distorting and conjecturing in a state of half-understanding. It was not until the Qing Dynasty that the method of studying classics went on the road of textual research; this is the so-called methods of "exegesis," "substance and emptiness," and "analogy." After three hundred years of effort, research on classics has made some progress. However, by the time of the Qing Dynasty, the classical scholar Wang Guowei frankly told us that he did not understand one or two tenths of the Book of Poetry, and four or five tenths of the Book of Documents. Chuan Si-nian also said: "Even in the hands of experts, the Six Classics are only half-understood." Recently, with the help of grammar and the reference of bronze inscriptions and oracle bone inscriptions, the study of classics has embarked on the road of scientific organization. Although there have been many new advances and new classical scholars have made many new contributions, there are still many areas that are not understood. Indeed, in fact, it is not only the difficulty in reading and understanding the classics, but also the so-called ancient prose in general. If we raise the standard of reading, it is not something that ordinary people who "read poetry and books superficially" can understand.

However, bizarre facts are commonly appearing in current primary and secondary education. This kind of fact is spreading widely. Let's put aside the error of whether primary and secondary school students can accept the content of classics and ancient prose in terms of thought and intelligence, and talk about it from the fundamental issue. Those wise teachers (?) themselves only half-understand classics and ancient prose, and they don't even know what phonology, writing, exegesis, and textual research are; what enlightening method can they use to interpret ancient prose and classics? To make primary school students understand? I will now show some "words" and "characters" from "Reply to Li Meisheng's Letter" to teachers who have no knowledge of phonology, writing, and exegesis, and let them honestly estimate whether they are qualified to teach and explain classics, history, and ancient prose.

Example 1: "One spring morning and evening, autumn moon." — See Han Shu.

(Note) "Morning" in "morning sun" and "evening" in "evening moon" should be interpreted as sacrifices.

Example 2: "Entering its gate, there is no one guarding the gate; entering its boudoir, there is no one guarding the boudoir." — See Gongyang Zhuan.

(Note) "Gate" in "no one guarding the gate" and "boudoir" in "no one guarding the boudoir" should be interpreted as guards.

Example 3: "Step has a new dock." — See Han Yu's writings.

(Note) "Step" is the same as "dock." (Loan character.)

Example 4: "High gate hangs thin curtains." — See Zhuangzi.

(Note) "Thin" is interpreted as "curtain." (Loan meaning.)

Example 5: "Do not harbor resentment." — See [omitted].

(Note) "Harbor" is interpreted as "retain." (Extended meaning.)

Example 6: "Already has excessive power." — See Book of Poetry.

(Note) "Excessive" is interpreted as "great."

Example 7: "Party." — See Shuowen Jiezi.

(Note) Not clear. (Pictographic) Example 8: "The four stallions are very large." — See Erya.

Example 9: "Road gate." — See Erya.

(Note) "Road" and "large" are both interpreted as "great." (Extended meaning).

These explanations are not even considered satisfactory by new classical scholars. It is known how difficult it is to read classics, history, and ancient prose. Hu Shi said: "Today, it is ignorant to talk about reading classics and ancient prose, or reading classics and ancient prose in primary and secondary schools. It is not worth a learned person's smile." This is very pertinent. Now, I hope that wise teachers will quickly put down those flashy classics, history, and ancient prose, and give primary and secondary school students some substantial and useful knowledge!

### Bombing of a Mountain City — War Zone Diary —

— Sheng Dan

Due to the setbacks in the offensive on the Henan-Hubei routes, the Liuan line was also stopped at Yeji and could not move. The only way out was to vent their anger by indiscriminately bombing. Just like the "heroes" in the martial arts world, before returning empty-handed, they must take a dump somewhere to show that the "hero" is still "extraordinary." Moreover, before destruction, the formula will not be overturned. They always conduct reconnaissance first and distribute leaflets. The subtle and clever words, matched with colorful paper, show their extravagance despite tightening their belts.

The mountain city, with a population of less than 20,000, does not need to evacuate the population, it was already emptied long ago. On the day of destruction, the first three planes, bang bang bang—and then the county town within five miles around was immersed in a brownish-gray smoke, spewing out the strong smell of sulfur; the universe was silent. Only the roar of the rocks after being hit by bombs seemed to say, get out of here, you weaklings!

The first three planes returned dejectedly, and another three appeared in the sky, which is said to be called "wheel bombing"; and half an hour later, another three came, and the sound of stones and bombs fighting lasted until noon. The "wheel bombing" finally ended, and the flames in the southwest half of the city indeed soared into the sky.

"Incendiary bombs! Damn it!…"

The fire continued to burn until evening, and it still did not recede. The area near the county government outside the East Gate became a scorched earth. Many collapsed houses were emitting white smoke. At the entrance of the airplane cave at the foot of the mountain, there were five or six headless and broken-armed corpses, naturally victims who could not escape; but besides this, no one was injured, and everyone was the same as usual. The only difference was that a deep impression of destruction was left in everyone's mind, teaching you to thoroughly recognize the face of the "hero."

The mountain city seems to be destroyed, but the Dabie Mountains will always exist stubbornly. The towering peaks are like countless iron fists stretched out by warriors, as if holding up the clear blue sky. No, it is preparing to shoot down the setting sun. When the rescue team returned from the eastern suburbs, a magnificent song suddenly came: Mountain city, bombed mountain city! Don't bow your head and sigh, or moan softly! Caress the new wounds—re-explore the path to light! Create your new life in the sparks! Mountain city, sharpen your sharp teeth, remove the miasma, swallow the dark clouds, and restore the eternal tranquility of the Dabie Mountains.

### Leap

— Ke Meng

Fallen leaves whirled and flew rustling; like snow, like butterflies.

Groans circled the roof, shivering. The walls, the table, the bed, the floor, in a word, all the furnishings in the room seemed to be crying, silent and gray. Let the lonely coughs hit them and bounce back.

"Feeling better?" I couldn't help but walk closer to the bedside and hold his hot hand tightly.

Coughs took turns answering, the bed, the person, and the room all groaned, as if enduring a suffering, a suffering that would burst the world.

Dusk hung outside the window, the wind hissed, but could not blow away the groans in the room.

Thirsty? Do you want some boiled water?

In the hazy light, he shook his head.

I stared at the gradually sinking eyes, ah, those eyes, those eyes, still flashing with stubborn light.

"Why are you looking at me like that?" A bitter smile flashed across his pale lips: "I'm not sick. I know what era I'm living in, what environment I'm in. I carry a healthy body and mind, running from south to north, from north to south... enduring all hardships, trying to liberate myself and some other oppressed people from a榨子 (a type of press), but accidental 'misfortune' drove me to this dead port. It took away my vitality. Cough—cough—…"

I stood there dumbfounded, unable to say a word of comfort.

"But I have to live, I have to live, I have to live!" His face turned redder, roaring, angry, as if an invisible magic power was lurking beside him that would devour his life at any time: "I have to live! I have recognized those demons who are doing cannibalism there, brewing germs there! … Everyone rise up and destroy them, tear them off from the body of the world!"

The light became brighter than before. It was quiet for a moment.

I stared again at the sleeping face after excessive excitement, it was slightly sweating—that sweat fully expressed his joy and satisfaction. "Oh, yes, he is not sick."

Darkness threw fallen leaves on the window lattice, making a rustling groan.

Sweat was flashing after the groans.

"Oh, yes, the world is sick, we have to tear off all the bad flesh from his body!"

### The Eagle and the Sparrowhawk

— Original by Henryk Sienkiewicz of Poland, translated by Ming

The eagle, near the sparrowhawk's nest, said to the sparrowhawk, "Listen to me, in my power!" "What do you want?" the sparrowhawk asked.

"I want to kill you and eat your meat." "Why do you want to kill me?"

"What a stupid thing! And I see that your news is not well-informed. My nest is too small, so I want your nest; that way my sons will have room to grow. Besides, I have my eagle policy, but you are speaking another language, and you do not obey my will."

"I speak the language that nature has given me. Can you tell me why I should obey your will?"

"I don't know, but I know that I have the right to kill anything that does not obey my will."

"So, I have no hope of being spared?" "I don't think so. But if you are prepared to sacrifice yourself, that is a great honor for you."

"Please tell me, my friend, where did you learn this way of thinking?"

"Hey, you stupid thing," the eagle replied, "don't you know that I studied in the Berlin Zoo for two years?"

### Samuel Goldwyn Selects Twelve Great Stars

— Mu Tao

The production giant Samuel Goldwyn has selected twelve stars based on many years of experience, believing them to be the greatest movie stars in his mind, and has briefly explained each one. The rankings are as follows:

(1) Charlie Chaplin Undeniably stands in the leading position of Hollywood stars. He is the greatest comedian and is not eliminated by time, and his reputation is still strong. His performance is more in the heart than in wit, and when we see him perform and laugh, tears often follow behind.

(2) Douglas Fairbanks The role he plays is the opposite of Chaplin. He has the spirit of American struggle. He represents the American imagination, and America made him an idol.

(3) Norma Shearer For the same reason, her name will last forever. She is the ideal woman, with outward beauty, spiritual courage, and mental brilliance. For more than ten years, she has not been affected by time and has become more popular.

(4) Mary Pickford This "American sweetheart" cannot but be included as one of the greatest stars. She enjoyed fame on the screen the earliest. Although she does not act now, there are still millions of fans who remember her.

(5) Marguerite Clark She is Mary Pickford's only opponent. His performance is almost identical to Mary's, the biggest difference is that she is a bit more frivolous than [Mary].

(6) Janet Gaynor She has the characteristics of Mary and Marguerite, petite and exquisite. The difference is that her performance is more gentle than deeply felt.

(7) Greta Garbo The first mysterious woman on the screen. Her natural ability made her a great actress, and her temperament made her a great star.

(8) Clara Bow She was born of love. She is exactly opposite to Greta Garbo

(9) Warner Baxter His selection as a great star is different from others. He is a representative of youth and strength. The audience loves him because he performs youthful movements.

(10) Will Rogers His greatness is due to his honest and sincere attitude in portraying the general people of America.

(11) Wallace Beery Because he represents an ordinary person who speaks rudely and vulgarly, people hope that he will appear on the screen so that they can recognize themselves.

(12) Eddie Cantor Besides Chaplin, he is the greatest comedian

Goldwyn believes that since the advent of film, there have been many great movie stars, such as Valentino and Gloria Swanson. But in his opinion, there are only the above twelve greatest movie stars.

### "West Wind Drama Society" and "Empress Dowager"

Historical stories are more commonly used as drama materials in the current environment. Some speculative theater groups are producing them crudely. Although these things that are "privately engaged in the back garden" are completely contrary to the times, they can shock a generation of petty citizens. However, it is ultimately a trick and a speculative act, and we absolutely cannot condone them.

Perhaps we will not forget that in November of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), the "Forties Drama Troupe" in Shanghai gave a honorary performance of Mr. Xia Yan's play "Sai Jinhua"! Its performance swept away the group of ugliness like autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The theatrical movement in Shanghai after the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle was even more prosperous than before; this is not speculation, it is indeed adapting to the needs of the times; at least it can be said: "The isolated island is not isolated"! The "Forties" ended due to various reasons, which is such a pity, but there are not a few successors; recently, Yue Feng contacted many outstanding figures in the drama, film, and education circles, and organized a "West Wind Drama Society", preparing to perform "Empress Dowager" in a short time.

Comparing "Empress Dowager" and "Sai Jinhua", it is of course felt that the former has more value for performance than the latter, because Sai Jinhua is only a famous prostitute in the late Qing Dynasty. Although her beauty is famous, her relationship with history and politics is still superficial. She only persuaded the commander of the Allied Forces, the German Waldersee, with justice and beauty during the Eight-Nation Alliance, so that the people in the Pingjin area suffered less from the disaster of war: As for the Empress Dowager, she is simply a great woman of a generation in the four thousand years of China. Apart from Wu Zetian, no one can compete with her. However, when Wu ruled, our country was still a closed country, and everything was of course easier to deal with, but in the more than sixty years of the Empress Dowager's rule, it was a time when foreign enemies and internal troubles were intertwined. She relied on her unique political talent and extraordinary skills to deal with the situation. The hardships she went through were tens of thousands of times more difficult than Sai Jinhua; in her life's work, there are indeed many materials that can be used for our reference, whether she is successful or unsuccessful.

This rising drama troupe, the "West Wind Drama Society", adopted such a story for its first performance. It will cause a sensation when it is performed in the future.

We are looking forward to it.

### A Week's Essays

— Xiao Tian

(53)

As the saying goes: Peaches and plums do not speak, yet a path forms beneath them. Path means path. It means that peaches and plums, because of their blossoms and fruits, do not need to call out, but people compete to go there, coming and going without end, and a path naturally forms beneath them. Red dancers are also the peaches and plums of the dance hall, so dance halls compete to recruit red stars, which is also to seek prosperity and flourishing business. Hu Yanyan of Dahua initially had no reputation, but her beauty was outstanding among her peers. In recent months, she has become good at dressing up, and her dancing skills have also improved, and she has also learned to socialize a little, so her name has become very popular. Major dance halls are competing to hire her, but Hu's mother believes that Dahua is her birthplace and does not want to forget her roots, so she still has no intention of climbing to higher branches. However, if there are other reasons in the future to leave Dahua, she will definitely move to the metropolis, because of A Feng and A Kang's firm invitation, and although Hu's mother and daughter are villagers, they know how to value their promises.

Yesterday, a friend invited me to a banquet at Feda, where I met Mi Ling, a poet formerly of Daxin, who gave me a silly smile. The person sitting with him seemed to be his [blank], the two of them were talking intimately, looking quite harmonious. I only hope that their flowers will always be beautiful and the moon will always be round.

I happened to be with a star from Paramount at Xianle, passing by Mattehust Road, and saw an advertisement for Sanyou Pills, which said: The way of husband and wife is very mysterious. If you do it well, you will smile. The star asked: What is so mysterious between husband and wife? How can you do it well? I was speechless. My friend said: You'll know when you marry a husband.

Who knew that his housekeeper colluded with the buyer, and wrote some slippery and clever words on the sales contract without him knowing. On the surface, it said that the house was purchased for 100,000 yuan, but who would have thought that after the silver was handed over, Tang suddenly sent a large number of military police to drive out the entire family of the Rong family, old and young, servants, and maids. Except for the clothes they were wearing, all the furniture and antiques were not allowed to be moved out. This scared the fourth master Rong silly. When he looked for the housekeeper again, he had already run away. With great difficulty, he asked someone to talk to the Tang family, and they replied: "Who would spend 100,000 yuan to buy your broken bricks (meaning empty houses)? It was made clear from the beginning that it included the furniture." At that time, Tang was very powerful, and the contract was not clear. Even if he filed a lawsuit, he would not necessarily win. So later, he still asked someone to plead with reason, and only managed to take out some of the antiques and treasures. As for those fine wooden furniture such as patterned sandalwood and rosewood, not a single piece was taken out. Rong Jun suffered this dumb loss and was even more ashamed to show his face, so I never saw him again during my years in Peking, but his name as a silly person was very prominent.

In addition to the fourth master Rong, there is also a fourth master Zhong, who is also around fifty years old. He has always had the nickname of a silly young master. His father used to be the governor of Sichuan. During the late Qing Dynasty, there was no position more noble than the governor-general of Sichuan. It was an excellent and lucrative position. After one term, he could earn a lot of money, and he also bought a large mansion in the old capital. After his father passed away, he was in complete control of this family fortune. Zhong Si also loves drama very much. His two favorite famous actors in his life are Old Tan and Xiao Lou. When Old Tan was alive, as long as there was a play, he would go with Yan San (Ju Peng) to listen. The two of them became friends from listening to operas. Sometimes Old Tan sang in the city and it was late, so Ju Peng would stay at the Zhong residence. If there was a play outside the city, Zhong Si would stay at Yan San's house. (154)
