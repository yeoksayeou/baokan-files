Editorial

### Japan's Political Conspiracy

Because Japan's invasion of China has encountered difficulties in military progress, it has had no choice but to use political conspiracies to instigate peace, attempting to divide China's anti-Japanese front and weaken its resistance strength, so as to end the war under conditions of victory. This would not only digest the interests already gained, but also dismantle China's unity, causing China to return to the state of pre-war strife, thus taking the opportunity to engage in further aggression. Although this conspiracy has been repeatedly shattered by China's strong anti-Japanese front, it has not only not disappeared to this day, but has become increasingly intense in direct proportion to the increasing difficulty of Japan's military progress.

Since the War of Resistance entered its second stage, Japan's military progress in China has not only made no progress, but has become increasingly mired in difficulties. To attack the Northwest, it suffered one defeat in western Shanxi and another in southern Shanxi, and its attempts to cross the river became a complete bubble. To open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, it was thwarted in the northern border of Hunan and Hubei, and hindered in Huaxian and Xinjie in the south. To attack the Southwest, it cannot cross Beihai and Sanshui. In the various guerrilla areas, the Chinese guerrilla forces are extremely active, launching attacks anytime, anywhere, resulting in exhaustion in responding, and being in a dilemma of advancing and retreating. Not only that, since the launch of the war, its domestic finances have fallen into a state of utter exhaustion, with currency inflation, rising prices, and people struggling to survive, and anti-war sentiment is rising. Many university professors have been arrested for opposing the war, and left-wing parties have launched large-scale anti-war movements. These facts have made the Japanese rulers also keenly aware of the disadvantages of long-term warfare against China, and therefore used the conspiracy to instigate peace as a way to seek survival from death. On the one hand, taking advantage of the British ambassador's inspection of northern China, it issued a telegram in the name of civil organizations and prominent figures in northern China, calling for peace. On the other hand, it used the "German-Italian Axis" to send Matsuda, a member of the House of Peers, and Kurihara, a member of the House of Representatives, to China to lobby the Italian ambassador to China, asking him to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. At this time, Germany, eager for Japan to achieve victory in China, spread rumors in Chongqing about "German-Soviet friendship" and that the "Anti-Comintern Pact" would become a waste of paper, in an attempt to sow discord between China and the Soviet Union and relax China's resistance efforts.

The reason why Japan wants to take advantage of the British ambassador's inspection of northern China, and falsely use names to issue telegrams calling for peace, is not only to divide China's anti-Japanese front, but also to try to change the perception of third countries about China's resistance. Because Britain has recently had a more active understanding of China's resistance; it not only united with the United States and France to protest against Japan's destruction of international treaties and forcible occupation of foreign interests in China, but also lent money to China to provide economic assistance, giving Japan's invasion of China a considerable blow. Therefore, it has no choice but to fabricate facts and confuse the public, in order to reduce British sympathy and assistance to China. However, the people of northern China already deeply understand its treacherous plan. In addition to telegraphing the whole country to expose its conspiracy, they also sent a letter when the British ambassador arrived in Tianjin, declaring their loyalty to the National Government and their determination to resist Japan to the end, with no false idea of calling for peace, in order to dispel the false rumors and correct the record. As for its conspiracy to use the "German-Italian route" to lure a few unstable elements in the anti-Japanese front who do not understand the overall situation and disregard the facts, in order to divide China's unity, and thus make it impossible for the resistance to continue, it is also a futile effort with no effect. Because since Wang Jingwei and others betrayed the country, those who advocated taking the "German-Italian route" have long since disappeared and dared not show their faces.

For nineteen months, the result of the Chinese people's arduous sacrifices has made the whole country thoroughly understand that in order to complete national liberation, only resistance to the end can achieve the goal. China is fundamentally a country that has been oppressed and invaded. This resistance is entirely because it cannot bear the oppression and invasion, and only then has it risen up in self-defense, that is, for the sake of national survival and national liberation, it has painfully made a great determination and embarked on the path of resistance. War is self-defense, and not fighting is surrender, is submission, is self-destruction! Now the prospects for China's victory are becoming increasingly bright. Why give up halfway to achieving the summit after climbing nine mountains? May all the Chinese people promote the spirit of hard work and perseverance to crush all of Japan's political conspiracies. The donkey's trick is exhausted, let's see what tricks it will play next?

### Sino-British Continued Negotiations; Loan of Four to Five Million Pounds; Contract for Three Hundred Trucks to Be Signed Immediately; The United States Is Also Considering Consolidating the Chinese Currency System

(London) Reuters exploration: The Sino-Government Procurement Committee is about to sign a contract with the British side to purchase three hundred three-ton and seven-ton trucks for use on the Burma Road. The funds will be allocated from the British credit loan of 500,000 pounds to China. According to previous reports, the Burma Road has unsound engineering, and trucks cannot be heavier than three tons. However, the road construction is gradually improving, so this batch of seven-ton trucks should be able to travel smoothly when they arrive in the future. It is also heard that preliminary negotiations are about to begin, the purpose of which is to allow China to have larger funds to purchase railway and telegraph materials. It is said that the amount is between four and five million British pounds, but it cannot be confirmed at present, because the negotiations are still in the preliminary stage. It is widely rumored that the British loan to China must take the form of a Sino-British currency stabilization fund, but what is certain is that there is no practical way at present and it is unlikely to be established in a short time. There is reason to believe that the United States is also considering the same method of assisting Chinese currency, but it cannot be hoped that it will be announced immediately. In addition, a method of restoring the repayment of customs-guaranteed debts is also under active negotiation. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)

(London) The Export Credit Guarantee Bureau's Expanded Powers Bill (the main point of which is to increase the guarantee amount from 50 million pounds to 75 million pounds) was recently passed by the Lower House on its third reading. Prior to this, Liberal Party member Griffiths delivered a speech saying, "If we wish to find a suitable opportunity, we must use huge funds in the Chinese side. We know deeply how the situation in China is. We also know that the Chinese people can still maintain their industry with perseverance during the war. I have heard from authoritative sources that Chinese railways have great potential for development, especially the railway line to Myanmar, which can be assisted by British industry. This is an opportunity to achieve satisfactory results and benefit both China and Britain. I don't know whether the government has designated special funds." The Minister of Overseas Trade, Hudson, immediately replied, "The supply of railway materials to China is a large-scale transaction, requiring long-term credit loans, which is not within the scope of this case. If we discuss this in the future, we will submit another bill." (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)

Last autumn, a bumper harvest was also achieved, so food reserves are actively large, enough for military rations and civilian food. In the enemy-occupied areas, thousands and thousands of soldiers have risen up to disturb the enemy's rear. The people of the whole country feel that the enemy is becoming increasingly old and victory is in sight, so they deeply hate the traitors who compromise and surrender to the enemy.

The interests of the United States in the Pacific are concentrated in Guam and the Philippine Islands, while the interests of the United Kingdom are widely dispersed; 4.

### Sino-German Exchange of Goods Agreement; China Provides Tung Oil, Tungsten Products, etc.; Germany Provides Several Batches of Ordnance and Bullets; This Action Only Satisfies the German Side

(London) Regarding the rumor that the German organization "Hapuluo," which was previously established in Hong Kong and had agreed with the Chinese government to exchange tung oil, tungsten products, and other minerals worth 100 million yuan, is about to be liquidated, Chinese communities here have not yet received any confirmed news. However, it is claimed that this liquidation is inevitable. China has obtained several batches of ordnance and bullets under the exchange agreement, but this action only satisfies the German side. The items provided by Germany to China include a large number of things that require little effort to use and other large quantities of manufactured goods that cannot be sold elsewhere and are useless to China. As for saying that this exchange of goods agreement can cause China's tung oil and other items to fetch higher prices in the open market, in fact, tung oil is a special product of China, and tungsten is produced in large quantities in China. Even without this Sino-German exchange of goods agreement, the whole world would still widely purchase from China, and there is no need to worry about the decline in its market price.

### Arita Warns the Japanese; Do Not Stimulate American Public Opinion; Draft of Reply to the United States, Britain and France Completed; German and Italian Ambassadors Visited Sawada Yesterday

(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita said in the Diet today that Tokyo is open to holding an international conference to explain Japan's attitude towards China to third countries, saying that in his opinion, there are other ways to dispel such misunderstandings. Arita also said that Japan is prepared to repel attacks from the Soviet Union or any other country. Arita went on to mention anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States and advised the Japanese not to take unnecessary actions that would stimulate American public opinion. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) German Ambassador to Japan Lieutenant General Ott and Italian Ambassador Auriti visited Foreign Minister Sawada one after another this morning to discuss matters. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) The United States, Britain, and France lodged protests on December 30th of last year and January 14th and 18th of this year regarding Japan's policy towards China. After careful research and coordination by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities, a draft reply has been largely obtained and will be submitted to the Cabinet Council within a few days, to be officially issued around the 10th of this month. It is expected that its content will be generally as resolute as the statement of the Japanese government's policy towards China, as declared in previous statements. It is a matter of great regret that the views of the United States, Britain, and France on China are different from those held by Japan. However, from Japan's point of view, it is still prepared to fully explain Japan's policy to make it understood. As for the international conference proposed by the United States, Britain, and France, Japan believes that, given the precedents of past international conferences, such diplomatic negotiations are not sufficient to help solve the problem.

### Ambassador Gu Hosts Farewell Banquet for Bishop Yu Bin

(Paris) Chinese Ambassador to France Dr. Gu Weijun hosted a banquet yesterday in honor of Bishop Yu Bin of the Catholic Diocese of Nanjing. After the banquet, Yu boarded a ship to the United States to continue promoting China's war of resistance and calling for relief for domestic refugees. (3rd Hai Tong dispatch)

(Paris) Bishop Yu Bin of the Catholic Diocese of Nanjing, China, gave an interview to a reporter from the Paris "Le Jour" yesterday, stating that the Chinese army is stronger than last year, with 200 divisions, of which mechanized units account for more than a quarter. In other words, the country has more than 50 divisions of modern equipment. In addition, there are more than 4 million guerrillas in the Japanese-occupied areas, and more than 20,000 Japanese soldiers are killed in the rear every month. Since our country received a large amount of financial assistance last November, we can prepare for a long-term war. We are now gradually organizing the people, and we are already able to manufacture rifles, machine guns, and small-caliber artillery ourselves. (3rd Hai Tong dispatch)

### Wang Jingwei Will Go to Europe; Has Asked the Government to Issue a Passport; Chen Bijun and Zeng Zhongming Will Go Together

(Hong Kong) According to news received here, Wang Jingwei, who recently advocated Sino-Japanese peace talks and has been condemned by all parties, will soon leave the country for Europe. Wang has asked the central government to issue a passport for leaving the country. As soon as it is sent to Hanoi, he can travel to Europe with his wife Chen Bijun, private secretary Zeng Zhongming, and others. (3rd Hai Tong dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to foreign sources, when the Japanese Diet convened the day before yesterday, a certain member of the Minseito Party raised a question as to why the Japanese government has not responded to Wang Jingwei's peace movement in China. Foreign Minister Arita replied that the Japanese government is not in a position to actively assist Wang Jingwei's peace movement because if Japan's assistance is too excessive, it will hinder Wang's actions.

### Romanian Countries End Talks; Maintain Current Friendship

Capital of Yugoslavia: After the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Cabinet, Stoyadinović, and the Foreign Minister of Romania, Gafenco, concluded their talks, an official communique was recently issued, saying, "Romania and Yugoslavia have the same views on various international issues. Not only are the two sides have long-standing friendship, but also are allied countries. In the future, they must maintain the existing close relationship and are willing to maintain good relations with other countries, especially neighboring countries, based on the spirit of peace and cooperation. All this has been clearly demonstrated by this conversation." Foreign Minister Gafenco also told the press before returning home that the scope of this conversation was not limited to political issues, but also involved transportation issues. The most important of these was the construction of a new highway, starting from the Italian port of Trieste on the Adriatic Sea, crossing Romania and Yugoslavia to reach the coast of the Black Sea, the Romanian port of Constanța. (2nd Havas dispatch)

### France in Contact with Spanish Nationalist Military Government

Andaye: There are some urgent events between France and the Spanish Nationalists that need to be negotiated and resolved. Recently, a moderate Senator, Zhang Lall (former Minister of Education), passed through here to meet with the Nationalist authorities in Burgos, Spain. Issues such as how to repatriate refugees from the Autonomous Region of Catalonia in France, and how to deal with political prisoners detained by the Nationalists, will be discussed. It is said that Zhang Lall's mission is only to gather information. As for whether France and the Spanish Nationalists are preparing to have diplomatic contacts, and whether the French government will send an official representative to be stationed in Burgos, it will be decided after Pellar returns. It is said that Pellar will return to the country on the 5th of this month. (3rd Havas dispatch)

(Paris) Political figures in France are now paying attention to France's appointment of a special envoy to the Spanish Nationalist Military. According to news from the Chamber of Deputies, former Prime Minister Flandin visited Prime Minister Daladier yesterday, and Daladier immediately told him that "this matter is in progress, and the government will decide on it at the appropriate time." Therefore, people generally speculate that this already indicates that the government will decide to appoint a special envoy to Burgos by the end of this week. Regarding the candidates for the special envoy, the following three were mentioned yesterday: General Gatro, the current Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, Mistre, and the former Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, Malyan.

### Issue Passports to Yunnan Carefully; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Special Instructions

Recently, in order to strictly prevent Chinese traitors from moving from Vietnam to Yunnan, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially instructed the Hong Kong Visa Office to conduct detailed investigations on the identities and occupations of travelers entering Yunnan in the future, and to issue passports only after obtaining reliable guarantor assurances. In order to understand the real situation of this matter, the reporter specially visited the office yesterday for inquiries, and received the following response:

Yunnan Province Strictly Inspects Travelers

It is said that since the focus of the war shifted to South China, the only transportation routes in South China are Guangzhou Bay and Haiphong. From there, one can pass through Yunnan to various parts of our country. Therefore, in order to strictly prevent Chinese traitors from entering the inland under false pretenses, the Yunnan authorities have set up a traveler entry inspection office in the Chinese area near Haiphong to strictly inspect travelers. Even those with passports must be inspected thoroughly before being allowed to pass. If it is considered slightly suspicious or the resume is unclear, it is necessary to have two reliable shops in Haiphong act as guarantors before being allowed to enter the country. In the past month, there have been dozens of cases of overseas Chinese who have already obtained passports in Hong Kong being blocked in Haiphong because they did not understand this procedure beforehand. In view of this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially instructed this office to carefully investigate the identity and occupation of those applying for passports and to issue passports only to those with guarantor assurances in order to reduce the troubles of travelers entering the inland. Recently, this office has received instructions and has issued a formal announcement.

The Hong Kong Visa Office Issues an Announcement

The announcement reads: Announcement from the Hong Kong Visa and Manifest Office of the Republic of China: It is hereby announced that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed that in the future, for nationals applying for passports to enter Yunnan via Vietnam, the identity and occupation of the passport applicant should be thoroughly investigated, and more attention should be paid to the matter of obtaining guarantees. Except for compliance with the regulations, this announcement is hereby made, and all those who apply for passports to enter Yunnan via Vietnam are requested to take note. In the future, when seeking guarantees, they should be more careful in their selection, so as not to cause self-harm. This is the announcement.

### Belgian Prime Minister Attacked and Injured

Brussels: The government's appointment of Dr. Malden as a member of the Flemish Institute for Medical Research has caused a storm. It is because Malden was sentenced to death for treason in 1920 and later received a pardon. Several members of Congress have introduced legislation arguing that no one who has been convicted by a court should be allowed to accept honors. The intention is to force the government to revoke the appointment. The case was recently submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak immediately delivered a speech, accusing the Chamber of Deputies of not making things difficult for him, and said, "If the Chamber of Deputies does not help me, it should give way to the wise. This kind of dispute only makes the Congress ridiculed." Many members of Congress were in an uproar, and the members of the Socialist Party, as well as those members and Prime Minister Spaak, insulted each other. Some members even waved their arms and fists, intending to fight. The Speaker had no choice but to adjourn the meeting. Afterwards, when Prime Minister Spaak drove back to his residence, veterans of the European War and young people held demonstrations near his residence. The car could not move forward, so the Prime Minister got out of the car and walked, but was injured on the forehead by the demonstrators. Finally, he was escorted by the police to enter his residence. (2nd Havas dispatch)

### The Soviet Government Announces Severance of Relations with Hungary; Following Germany and Japan has Lost its Independence; German Representative to Russia Turns Back Midway

(Moscow) Foreign Minister Litvinov notified the Hungarian Minister to Moscow, Arnoldi, today that the Soviet government had decided to close its legation in Budapest and hoped that Hungary would also close its legation in Moscow. According to TASS sources from authoritative sources, the Soviet government's decision to take the above action was due to the fact that Hungary had recently been under strong pressure from certain countries since the Munich Agreement was concluded. The Hungarian government's policies show that it has easily succumbed to this pressure and lost its independence to a considerable extent. In particular, the Hungarian government's decision to join the so-called Anti-Comintern Pact cannot be considered reasonable from the perspective of Hungary's own interests, because its interests do not coincide with those of the participants in the pact, especially the aggressive aims of Japan under the guise of the pact. Therefore, the Hungarian government's above-mentioned decision was made under external coercion. Hungary's stance has made it unnecessary for the Soviet government to maintain diplomatic relations with the country through the legations specially established in the two capitals. In the future, this relationship can be maintained through the representatives of the two countries stationed in the capitals of third countries. (2nd TASS dispatch)

(Moscow) After the Soviet government suddenly severed diplomatic relations with Hungary, diplomats from various countries here, including the staff of the Hungarian Legation, were surprised. Soviet political figures said that since Hungary had signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, its stance had been undoubtedly determined. The Soviet government then resolutely severed diplomatic relations with it. This move was not only aimed at dealing with Hungary but also served to warn other countries that intended to follow in its footsteps, such as Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Turkey. Even Yugoslavia, which has not recognized the Soviet Union, can learn from this. Germans here have the same view of the Soviet government's move, saying that the Soviet government's communique specifically pointed out that Japan should be held responsible for the Anti-Comintern Pact, while avoiding mentioning Germany and Italy, which is noteworthy. Although the trip of Schnurre, the head of the East European Section of the Trade Department of the German Foreign Ministry, to Moscow has been postponed, the negotiations on the conclusion of a commercial agreement will not be abandoned as a result. (2nd Havas dispatch)

(Paris) The severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary has recently been commented on by well-informed sources here, saying that the Soviet Union took this decisive action to warn Hungary not to be completely controlled by German forces without realizing it. Soviet figures here said that Hungary, at the request of the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact, agreed to join the Pact, which is tantamount to giving up independence. In view of this, the Soviet government decided to sever diplomatic relations with it. This matter has no common precedent in diplomatic history. Its intention is probably because the Hungarian people have always cherished national honor, and the Soviet Union specially awakened them from the side so that the people would oppose joining the Anti-Comintern Pact because of their emphasis on independence. Then, although the government has agreed to join, it may still be impossible to implement it due to the constraints of public opinion. Therefore, it is worth noting what the Hungarian public opinion will react to. Observers in France said that the Soviet Union's intention may not be limited to this, but it may also want to use this move to hint to Poland not to get too close to Germany, thereby preventing Germany from expanding its influence eastward. This move coincided with Romanian King Carol's resolute reorganization of the cabinet and strict crackdown on the fascist Iron Guard, so it is no exaggeration to say that these two events are a clever attempt to prevent Germany from invading the Ukrainian region of the Soviet Union. (3rd Havas dispatch)

Warsaw: Schnurre, the head of the East European Section of the Trade Department of the German Foreign Ministry, came here a few days ago and originally planned to go to Moscow on official business, but he has now abandoned his plan and returned to Berlin today. According to foreign sources, alarming news had been released about Schnurre's trip, even saying that he intended to consult with the Soviet authorities on the issue of Germany supplying military supplies to the Soviet Union. The reason why Berlin has now summoned him back to the country may be for this reason. (2nd Havas dispatch)

### Explosion Occurs on the British Underground Railway; Five People Injured

(London) An explosion occurred in Leicester Square in London today, injuring five people, one of whom was seriously injured. An explosion also occurred on Tottenham Court Road. It is believed that someone placed a time bomb in a suitcase. Due to the repeated occurrence of explosions, the London Transport Authority has instructed all stations to immediately check the luggage storage rooms. In the future, any package must be opened by the depositor for inspection before it can be brought in. At a meeting in the House of Commons this morning, Labour leader Attlee inquired about the explosions. Home Secretary Hoare replied that explosions occurred at the Leicester Square underground station and the Tottenham Court Road station at 6 a.m. this morning, seriously injuring two people and causing considerable material damage. It was obviously caused by time bombs placed in the luggage storage room overnight. An active investigation is underway. According to the police, this kind of atrocity must have been committed by sympathizers of the Irish Republican Army. After receiving the alarm, the police rushed to the underground stations in various places and stationed themselves there permanently for defense. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

(London) After the successive explosions at the Tottenham and Leicester underground railway stations and luggage rooms in this city at around 6 a.m. this morning, the police rushed to the scene of the incident to conduct an investigation. They immediately found several metal fragments, which appeared to be fragments of alarm clocks and have been handed over to experts for examination. The authorities believe that members of the Irish fascist faction who participated in the Spanish National Military War are suspected and are being closely investigated. At the same time, after receiving the report, the Northern Ireland government immediately launched an investigation, paying particular attention to members of the "Irish Republican Army." Last November, several checkpoints on the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic were exploded. The explosives were placed in boxes and attached to a timing mechanism, which automatically exploded in time. Based on past experience, the authorities ordered the supervisors of various stations on the underground railway in the city to check all the luggage stored in the luggage rooms to avoid similar incidents. (3rd Havas dispatch)

(London) Home Secretary Hoare announced in the House of Commons yesterday that 33 people had been arrested in connection with the recent series of explosions across the UK. The police are still continuing their investigations and are taking all possible preventative measures. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

### France and Germany Continue Commercial Negotiations

(Paris) The French delegation has been conducting commercial negotiations with the German delegation in Berlin for two weeks and will need several more days to reach an agreement.

He will return to Berlin within a few days to continue the negotiations. (3rd Havas dispatch)

### Soviet Union Forbids Party Members to Interfere with Military Authority, Aiming to Strengthen the Red Army; Zhanggufeng Warriors Receive Decorations Again

(London) A Moscow dispatch from The Times states that the Central Committee of the Communist Party has approved the request of the Red Army's Supreme Command to reduce the power of political workers over military officers. New regulations will soon be announced, stipulating that officers above the rank of colonel, if subject to secret reports regarding political offenses, may not be indicted by low-ranking Party judicial organs within the army, nor may their conduct be discussed in meetings convened by junior officers. Only Party judicial organs composed of officers of the same or higher rank may handle such cases. The authorities have issued explanatory announcements, stating that low-ranking Party organs often abuse their power against officers they wish to humiliate, resorting to unconscious interference, thereby weakening the Red Army's strength. Now, an iron discipline is needed. Hereafter, subordinates must obey the commands of superiors, and the authority of superiors must be firmly established and fully supported by the Communist Party and the government. (Reuters, 2nd)

(Moscow) The Vice-Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khokhlov, personally awarded the Order of Lenin yesterday to the 40th Infantry Division of the First Special Army, which was commanded to bravely defend the Khasan Lake area. Many other Red Army soldiers and commanders were also awarded decorations. (TASS, 2nd)

### Mussolini to Deliver a Speech Today; Britain Plans Economic Negotiations with Germany and Italy, Key Lies in Mussolini's Attitude; Germany's Economic Situation Worsens Daily

(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is scheduled to deliver a speech at the Fascist Party meeting this afternoon. Well-informed sources here recently declared that, following German leader Hitler's speech on the 30th of last month, economic talks between Britain and the totalitarian states are possible. However, if Mussolini makes demands on France tomorrow, all hope will be dashed. Therefore, whether economic talks can proceed depends on the content of Mussolini's speech. It is generally believed that the British government may advise the Italian Prime Minister to adopt a moderate attitude before tomorrow, whether this is done through semi-official negotiations or through a personal letter from Prime Minister Chamberlain to the Italian Prime Minister remains unknown. Political circles believe that the key to the strength of the Italian Prime Minister's language lies not in British advice, but in the amount of assistance the German government can provide. (Havas, 3rd)

(London) A Berlin correspondent for The Times reports that, according to well-informed sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will use firm language to explain his demands on France tomorrow. At that time, the tense situation will begin to ease, but it will not become acute for two or three weeks. It is impossible to predict how long this crisis will last. (Reuters, 3rd)

(London) According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, a German colonial movement with significant formal changes will soon emerge. The correspondent also stated that, according to information received, all branches of the German Colonial Society have been instructed not to mention Britain's former colonies again, but to focus on demanding a larger share of colonies held or managed by other European countries of equal value. (Reuters, 3rd)

Munich: Today, it was formally announced that a large number of passenger trains would be suspended, which is the latest development in Germany's increasingly serious railway situation. It is reported that Germany has already canceled many express trains this year. Due to overcrowding, passengers often have to stand for long journeys or are unable to travel at all. According to a railway announcement, the heavy freight traffic necessitates further cancellation of passenger trains as a remedy. The current timetable no longer contains words like "special train," "additional passenger train," or "tourist train." Since the beginning of this year, the Berlin express has been canceled 28 times. (Reuters, 3rd)

(Berlin) The "Land Post" recently reported that "German agriculture is under serious threat due to a lack of labor." The total amount of agricultural production in the country had the potential to increase this year, but this has not been achieved due to insufficient labor. "What is worse, the shortage of labor on most farmland has become very serious in recent months. Not only is there no hope of increasing production, but there is even a danger of it declining." (Havas, 3rd)

(New York) The American Institute of Public Opinion recently conducted a poll on the issue of Germany recovering its former colonies. The question posed was, "Should the colonies taken from Germany after the European War be returned to that country?" The results of the poll have now been released: 17 percent are in favor, and 83 percent are opposed. The majority believe that even if the colonies are returned to Germany, Hitler would still not be satisfied and would continue to make demands, so it is better not to return them. The Institute of Public Opinion conducted a poll on this issue last year, with 24 percent in favor and 76 percent opposed. Comparing the two, it can be seen that the attitude of the American people has changed. (Havas, 2nd)

### Germany Demands Submarine Equality from Britain, Note Has Been Published

(London) Regarding the German government's request, in accordance with the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, to increase its total submarine tonnage to be equal to that of Britain, and to increase the number of 10,000-ton Class A cruisers from five to seven, the Foreign Office issued a bulletin today stating that British and German naval representatives held friendly talks in Berlin on December 30th of last year to discuss the matter. Subsequently, on January 18th, the German government submitted a written note stating, "The German government has decided to gradually increase its total submarine tonnage from 1939 onwards, in accordance with the rights granted by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, until it is equal to that of Britain, and to convert the two Class B cruisers currently under construction, 'K' and 'L', into Class A cruisers." (Havas, 2nd)

(London) The German request to increase its total submarine tonnage and increase the number of 10,000-ton Class A cruisers has been commented on by British naval officials. It is generally said that regarding the submarine portion, if Germany wants to increase its total tonnage to be equal to that of Britain, it is expected to take four years to achieve this goal, unless the rate of shipbuilding can be greatly increased. The existing submarine tonnage in the country ranges from 250 tons to 600 tons each. According to reliable information, the country plans to build large submarines ranging from 800 tons to 1,500 tons, with a range far exceeding that of existing submarines. Regarding the cruiser portion, Germany's request to increase the number of 10,000-ton Class A cruisers from five to seven is based on the grounds that the Soviet government is building seven such cruisers, but it has failed to provide concrete evidence. In addition, the Anglo-Soviet Naval Agreement stipulated that if Germany builds five Class A cruisers, the Soviet Union can build seven. Now that Germany has increased the number of such cruisers, the Soviet Union will inevitably follow suit in accordance with the safeguard clauses contained in the Naval Agreement, which will inevitably lead to a naval arms race. (Havas, 2nd)

### British and French Exchanges: Governor of Gibraltar to Visit French Morocco

Gibraltar: According to reliable sources, Sir Edmund Ironside, the Governor of Gibraltar, will officially visit French Morocco from February 13th to the 20th. A French cruiser squadron, which has been cruising around Gibraltar for three days, set sail for Melilla yesterday. The squadron is led by the flagship of the French Mediterranean Fleet Commander Vice-Admiral Abrial, the Alger. Vice-Admiral Abrial met with Sir Edmund Ironside and the Commander of the British Home Fleet, Sir Charles Forbes. The British Home Fleet arrived here last week and will sail out for maneuvers tomorrow, returning here on February 19th. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Canadian Authorities Explain Their Attitude: Still Support the British Empire

Ontario, Canada: Ontario Premier Hepburn declared at a luncheon yesterday that during the last World War, Canada recruited an army of 500,000 men, and will do so again if there is another war. Hepburn also responded to irresponsible remarks made by university professors, saying that Canada is willing to continue to be part of the British Empire, and if any new conflict occurs, Canada will make the same contribution as in 1914. (Reuters, 3rd)

Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister King recently declared to Parliament that the Canadian government has not entered into an agreement with the United States regarding joint defense of the Pacific.

### Roosevelt's Secret Diplomacy: Dissent Arises in the United States; Much Support for Aiding Democratic Nations; German and Italian Newspapers Indulge in Abuse

(Washington) The majority of members of Congress agree with President Roosevelt's policy of aiding democratic nations, but they say that the President's message to Congress, which stated that he would resist the threats of totalitarian states by all means short of war, was not detailed enough and should be publicly explained. As for the opposition, not all members of Congress oppose the President's current policy. For example, some Republican members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee have expressed the opinion that they do not oppose selling airplanes to democratic nations, but only on the condition that the United States does not become involved in the vortex of war. We firmly demand that the President inform the people of all the facts publicly and maintain the traditional foreign policy, that is, a neutral, non-interventionist, and peaceful policy. In short, the disagreements in Congress regarding the President's current policy are not related to fundamental issues. What is at issue is a procedural matter, namely, whether the President should implement this policy openly or keep it secret. The members of Congress cannot agree on this point. The majority of Democrats trust the President, while a minority of Democrats and Republicans want the President to provide detailed explanations. Regarding the actual situation, some Republicans, including Senator Austin, advocate restoring the neutral policy that existed before the European War, that is, supplying arms to all countries without discrimination, and at the same time protecting freedom of the seas in the event of war. Other members of the party, such as Senator Nye, say that arms should not be exported abroad even in peacetime. However, in order to avoid internal strife within the party, they would rather not discuss these fundamental issues and instead unite with a minority of "rebellious" Democrats to criticize the government on procedural issues, namely, that it should not keep secrets. (Havas, 2nd)

(New York) Newspaper criticisms of President Roosevelt's new policy mostly regret the secrecy of American diplomacy. The New York World-Telegram said that the President's bold and direct foreign policy is admirable, but the American people have the right to know about serious matters related to war and peace. This seems to be a very important issue. The Chicago Tribune said that the White House has become a palace. The President's actions are like those of an autocratic monarch, and his people cannot say a word about their own destiny and can be dragged into war as easily as the Hessians of 18th-century Germany. The Washington Post said that the government's efforts to facilitate the sale of airplanes to France are a factor in easing the current tension in Europe. (Reuters, 2nd)

(Washington) Due to much criticism from Congress regarding the United States' sale of airplanes to Britain and France, Interior Secretary Ickes came forward today to declare that the government's policy will not lead the United States into the vortex of war, and will also curb the outbreak of war. Ickes's remarks were aimed specifically at former President Hoover's attacks on the government's foreign policy. (Associated Press, 2nd)

(Berlin) US President Roosevelt continues to be the target of fierce attacks in German newspapers. The Hamburger Tageblatt even called him "the number one enemy of peace." Official circles still believe that the informal news of this secret meeting of the US government committee should not be formally criticized, but said that if President Roosevelt really made such remarks, then a serious view must be taken of them. It is said that no protest has yet been lodged with Washington. The authorities have instructed the newspapers to attack as much as possible, and the tone of the German newspapers' attacks on President Roosevelt is more personal than before. (Reuters, 3rd)

(Berlin) After US President Roosevelt decided to aid the democratic countries of Europe, the German newspapers have expressed indignation, saying that Roosevelt has "colluded with Third International Secretary-General Dimitrov," and the American people are therefore facing a "red crisis." It is also said that Roosevelt's policy will inevitably encounter greater resistance within the United States, which can be asserted with certainty. (Havas, 3rd)

(Rome) After US President Roosevelt held secret talks with members of the Senate Army Committee, indicating his willingness to aid the democratic countries of Europe, the newspapers here began to attack him fiercely today, saying that President Roosevelt "intends to overthrow the political systems of totalitarian states, incite Latin American countries to resist totalitarian states, and begin an arms race." Il Popolo d'Italia, traditionally known as the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, said, "The Roosevelt seen by world opinion is no longer just a person suffering from hysteria (excessive excitement), but is completely mad. The White House in Washington is a madhouse, not a presidential palace, and those who serve there are nurses, not Jews and thugs who deliberately incite war. This should no longer be surprising." The newspaper then took the opportunity to attack France, saying that France expressed joy after hearing Roosevelt's remarks, which is probably another illusion. If the efforts of the totalitarian states to establish a fair peace in Europe are ignored by others, causing war in Europe, then the United States should not be surprised, "for its borders in France have already been broken by us." (Havas, 3rd)

Ottawa: After US President Roosevelt issued a statement saying that he would aid the democratic countries of Europe, a government official close to the government told a Havas News Agency reporter that the Canadian government was very satisfied with this, and hoped that the current US Neutrality Act could be amended so that Canada could purchase military supplies from the US in wartime. In addition, the Montreal Star reported, "President Roosevelt's statement is the best news internationally since the establishment of the Versailles Treaty. Public opinion, which firmly resists the totalitarian states' policy of aggression, is thus even more powerful. Therefore, Roosevelt's move is the most important factor in preserving world peace." (Havas, 3rd)

Los Angeles: Regarding the recent bomber test flight accident, a shocking discovery has been made. According to officials here, the accident may have been caused by sabotage by Nazi spies. The Western Seaboard branch of the "Industrial Improvement Association" chairman, Bridgeman, wired President Roosevelt that Nazi spies and sympathizers were actively working at the "North American Aviation Plant" to sabotage the airplanes being built for the US government. It is said that several members of the "German-American Bund" (an organization of Americans who sympathize with the Nazis) are suspected. It is reported that when the ill-fated plane crashed, French Aviation Ministry representative Schmidlin was participating in the test flight and died at the scene. (Havas, 2nd)

(Washington) In his defense message to Congress on January 12, President Roosevelt requested an appropriation of US$50 million to restore operations at idle airplane factories in order to immediately implement the accelerated airplane construction plan. Several members of the House Appropriations Committee therefore visited President Roosevelt this month to discuss technical aspects. The meeting lasted one and a half hours. Afterwards, the members said that, in the President's opinion, the international situation was such that this bill urgently needed to be passed without amendment. (Havas, 2nd)

### International Situation Tense, Hong Kong Authorities Busy Preparing for War, Army and Navy Increase Recruitment of Volunteers, Air Defense Equipment Effectively Strengthened

Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the beginning of this month, the international situation has become increasingly tense. The Spanish Civil War rebels' occupation of Barcelona, Italy's demand for colonies from France to satisfy its so-called "natural desires," increasing troops on the borders of French territories in East Africa, and echoing Germany, all are sufficient to trigger a second World War. In the Far East, the advent of the Hiranuma Cabinet in Japan has intensified its offensive against China, repeatedly declaring that it will not hesitate to fight China and Russia simultaneously and that it will not hesitate to have a head-on conflict with Britain and occupy Hong Kong. Therefore, the prelude to an international war in the Pacific is also on the verge of breaking out. For this reason, the Hong Kong authorities, in order to prevent problems before they occur, have recently been actively strengthening the defense capabilities of the army, navy, and air force, and engaging in various wartime preparations. Some Chinese high-ranking refugees who have taken refuge in Hong Kong regard this small island in the South China Sea as a paradise, but they do not know that this "haven of peace" that is peaceful all year round is actually a volcano. The recent war preparations of the Hong Kong authorities are briefly described below.

Strengthening the Army

Hong Kong is an island, and in future wars, the army will not be as important. However, the experienced British do not neglect the expansion of the army's strength because of this. The current number of troops in Hong Kong is a military secret, and we cannot find out. However, judging from the repeated reinforcements in the past year, it can be seen that the number is already considerable. Recently, the Hong Kong government has also newly established a large number of wooden barracks near the Seven Sisters swimming pool in Hong Kong and transferred four new battalions of troops to be stationed there. These four new battalions are British defense forces stationed in Hong Kong for a long time. Therefore, the total number of British troops stationed in Hong Kong is now more than 10,000. The Hong Kong authorities are also working hard to recruit British, Indian, and Chinese people in Hong Kong to join the volunteer army. As a result of repeated recruitment, the total number of volunteers is now several thousand. The training and organization of the volunteer army are the same as those of the regular army, and they are divided into infantry, artillery, and navy. Like the regular army, they are trying their best to mechanize it. Taking the army volunteers as an example, they are divided into rifle teams, machine gun teams, armored vehicle teams, and mechanized teams. As for the degree of mechanization of the regular army, it is even more amazing. In addition to the original motorcycle team, armored vehicle team, and mechanized team, the latest tanks will also be delivered recently, making the army's strength more and more powerful. Artillery, which is closely related to the army, is undoubtedly important in Hong Kong's defense. The strength of the fortifications built in Hong Kong in the past two years is already amazing, and the strengthening of the artillery's strength is also increasing day by day. Recently, the caliber of the artillery positions in the major and minor forts near Stanley and Sai Wan has been enlarged, and important equipment such as automatic measuring instruments has been added. At the same time, a large number of secret artillery positions and machine gun nests have been built, and the recruitment and training of Chinese artillery volunteers are being carried out actively.

Strengthening the Navy

Hong Kong's naval power is also very strong. There are more than 30 warships stationed for a long time. These warships regularly patrol and exercise in Hong Kong's territorial waters, and the sound of cannons is already a common sight. In addition to various warships, there are also aircraft carriers, torpedo boats, etc. Recently, the naval exercises of various warships have been intensified. Even torpedo boats, which are not usually exercised, have been crisscrossing the bottom of the blue sea in twos and threes in recent days. The Hong Kong government has also spared no effort in recruiting, organizing, and training naval volunteers. There are now more than 2,000 Chinese and Indian people who have joined the naval volunteer army, but the naval authorities are still continuing to recruit. The organization of these volunteers is divided into mine sweeping teams, mine laying teams, patrol teams, inspection teams, telecommunications teams, signal teams, sailor teams, etc. If an emergency occurs, all of them can be mobilized to participate in combat. At the same time, a blockade ship was shipped from England a week ago. This type of blockade ship is specially used for blockading and opening up seaports. The ship is very large and equipped with various blockade materials and machinery. Its activities are extremely convenient. If a war breaks out, the ship can firmly block the seaport in a few hours, making it impossible for enemy ships to break in. If the situation becomes stable, the blockades can be completely removed in a few hours. Therefore, this new type of blockade weapon is a pioneering achievement in the Far East.

Intensifying Air Defense

The Hong Kong authorities pay even more attention to air defense than to the army and navy. The current preparations for air force strength and air defense capabilities are quite adequate. Therefore, in recent months, there have been no reports of adding aircraft, building airfields, or other such matters. However, aircraft are dispatched from time to time to conduct bombing exercises, and the underground anti-aircraft guns also conduct live ammunition exercises accordingly. For example, on the 9th and 10th of this month, the air force authorities dispatched several bombers carrying many 500-pound and 250-pound bombs to bomb the areas around Ma Shi Wan and Shek Ngau Wan in rotation, while the underground anti-aircraft artillery teams fired fiercely from morning to night. The performance of the air raid was extremely tense. As for the installation of alarm machines, there are currently 14 units, and 20 newer and more complete units are being shipped from England and will arrive in Hong Kong for assembly next month. Once the assembly is completed, a large-scale night raid exercise will be held. As for the volunteer team for air defense, 8,000 people have been recruited so far, and 5,000 more are being recruited. These 13,000 air defense volunteers will be divided into 2,000 posts to guide residents in air defense and bomb shelters. The types of organizations are divided into alarm, medical, rescue, engineering, fire, disinfection, ambulance drivers, and delivery. As for the construction of air raid shelters, it is also being carried out actively. It is divided into three types: one is the air raid shelter with a very large scale built by the government with funds; one is to use the large buildings in the prosperous streets to open rooms for bomb shelters; and one is to encourage private individuals to dig bomb shelters in their residential gardens. Six months ago, the Hong Kong authorities only divided the construction of bomb shelters into two types: one was to use large buildings, and the other was to try to build several bomb shelters with flat roofs and green paint on the racecourse. However, in view of the indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft in the Sino-Japanese War, even tall Western-style buildings cannot avoid being penetrated to the bottom, and bomb shelters exposed on the ground are only enough to avoid fragments of bombs. If a bomb hits, deaths and injuries will still be inevitable. Therefore, the air defense authorities have recently abandoned this plan and plan to build extremely large-scale bomb shelters in the mountains, while doing their best to encourage private construction and hoping that all engineers will pay attention to this when designing and building houses. As for poison gas prevention, in addition to strengthening poison gas prevention equipment, they also plan to purchase a large number of anti-trial masks from the United Kingdom and distribute them to residents for use, and the value of each mask is only one yuan. The Hong Kong authorities can be said to be doing their best.

### Japanese Warship Discovered in Xiangshan Port

Ningbo Correspondence: At 2:40 pm on the 1st, a Japanese warship No. 4 was discovered in Xiangshan Port. It sailed from Huangsha Port to Hengshan Port in Yindong and moored. It immediately used machine guns to strafe passing sea ships and civilian ships, and lowered speedboats to intercept civilian ships. Two cargo ships were hijacked and the boatmen were arrested for questioning, and then they were released. In the evening, the warship used searchlights to illuminate the coast. The coastal defense troops have been placed on strict alert.

### Qingpu Puppet Yao Miaoling Takes the Stage

Qingpu Correspondence: After the establishment of the Qingpu puppet county government, Bao Nanshan was appointed as the puppet magistrate. After the guerrilla team led by Tian Xiu came out and recovered Zhujiajiao, and the puppet pacification commander Yang Anxin was captured, Bao Nanshan fled without a trace. The Japanese troops stationed in Qingpu listened to the plan of Ye Changyi, the puppet "police chief," and Zhujiajiao was thus occupied for the second time. The puppet magistrate was then concurrently held by Ye. Now, Yao Miaoling, originally from Shanghai, has had dealings with the Japanese side for a long time. After much lobbying with the puppet provincial government, she was appointed as the puppet magistrate of Qingpu County a few days ago. Yao took the stage in full makeup one day. Zhang Jiayao, Wang Daoxing, Chen Qisheng, Xu Boxin, Qin Shuqiu, etc., who were preparing the stage for Yao, went to the countryside to organize the puppet unified tax bureau. Wang Daoxing and Jin Xueyu were the puppet finance bureau's director and deputy director, respectively. Qin Shuqiu and Zhang Jiayao concurrently served as the director and deputy director of the puppet collection office.

### The New Fourth Army Attacks Jiaxing Pinghu, A County Government is Established in the Suburbs of Jiaxing

Jiaxing Correspondence: After the New Fourth Army arrived in Haiyan Haining, it advanced towards Jiaxing. The army's cadres sent a special service chief, Tao Liu, to Jiaxing to contact Jiang Shuwei, the commander of the new ×× division south of Jiaxing. He decided to extract the elite troops of his department to attack Jiaxing. The district chiefs of the county and the captains of the detachments have all been appointed. Zhao Chi, the county magistrate appointed by the provincial government, has also established a county government in the suburbs of Jiaxing to exert combat power nearby. The Pingjia Highway has long been completely destroyed. Many huge notices from Gu Zhutong were found in Xinfeng, the center of the road. The Jiaxing Japanese army had originally registered a unit from the headquarters. After being defeated by Zhu Xi's troops of the Chinese army between Wuzhen and Xinshi, the Japanese army cadres replaced them with the Koizumi unit. After the Koizumi unit arrived in Jiaxing, it forced the puppet county government to organize a railway protection association to specifically plan methods to protect the railway. Therefore, the Baos used the strong to draw strong men to organize a road protection team. The county's strong men were unwilling to be drawn and fled one after another. Recently, cannon fire has been rumbling around Jiaxing. Shen Junsheng's troops of the ×× division once stormed the Pinghu county seat and repelled the Japanese army in the Zhuhang Street and Xiaojie areas. The Japanese army in Pinghu retreated into the city and did not dare to go out. At the same time, Fan Jicai's troops of the Chinese army also defeated the Japanese army between Chongde, Shiwan, and Zhouquan, killing more than 40 people and seizing countless military supplies.

### Adapting to the Needs of the War of Resistance, Guangxi Province Strengthens the People's Military Strength, Carefully Selects County Magistrates for the Gendarmerie Areas, and Sets Up Self-Defense Regiments in Various Districts and Townships

Guangxi Correspondence: After the Xijiang Sanshui Estuary was occupied by the Japanese army, the military affairs of Guangxi Province have been greatly threatened. Recently, the Japanese fleet has once again gathered on Weizhou Island in the South Road, and there is a tendency to attack Beihai and advance into Nanning. Therefore, the national defense of Guangxi Province has been further strengthened, and at the same time, political issues have also been re-adjusted, so that the military and the people can jointly seek close unity to enhance the strength of the war of resistance. What has been put into practice is the various counties on the border of Guangxi, such as Cangwu, Huaiji, Cenxi, Rongxian, Yulin, Luchuan, Yongchun, etc., which are all connected to the Xijiang South Road of Guangdong Province. Once a war breaks out, the border counties will bear the brunt. Therefore, the authorities pay special attention to ensuring that the local people cooperate unanimously and assume the responsibility of defending Greater Guangxi. The outline has been stipulated as follows: (1) Adjust the grass-roots political personnel in various districts, townships, towns, villages, and streets to achieve military-civilian cooperation; (2) Strengthen the grass-roots people's military strength, assist in the work of resisting the war and eliminating traitors, and maintain local security. Based on the need to promote the above two things, and on the principle of local people handling local affairs, before the implementation of the popular election of county magistrates in various counties of the province, the county magistrates of the gendarmerie areas will be appointed first by people from this county. The current Cangwu county magistrate is Yan Haifeng, Tengxian is He Qi, Cenxi is Huang Guidan, Rongxian is Huang Weifang, Yulin is Jiang Wu, Pingnan County is Zheng Xiangchou, and Yongchun is Chen Wenzhong. Regarding the adjustment of the first item, the district, township, town, village chiefs used to be selected by the provincial and county governments from the cadres and training personnel of other counties or other townships. Since the adjustment, all of them have been changed to people from this district, township, town, village, and their qualifications are not limited to cadre training. It is necessary to see how their reputation is in the local area and whether they have the ability to call on the people to make a judgment. Since Guangxi Province implemented the policy of the trinity, all grass-roots political township and village chiefs must concurrently serve as the captain of the reserve team in the township and the principal of the elementary school, and the person must have been trained as a cadre for six months. The district and township chiefs are all young people, and they are courageous but lack experience in handling local affairs. Therefore, it is necessary to re-adjust the grass-roots politics of the districts and townships. Recently, the chiefs of various districts, townships, villages, and streets have all been appointed by local people, and they are not limited to cadres and training and the qualifications stipulated before. This is the reason. Regarding the second item, the most urgent thing is the organization of local self-defense and guerrilla warfare. The authorities, in view of the current needs of the war of resistance, decided to strengthen the military strength of various districts and townships: (1) The county governments must enrich the original organization of the district and township offices or expand the scope of the districts; (2) Each district office must set up a self-defense team (or guerrilla team) of at least 30 people or more, depending on the local economic strength; (3) Each township office must set up at least one self-defense team (11 or 12 people) to effectively protect the security of the township. The firearms in various districts and townships can be transferred from the county's civilian firearms, and the government will supply them with ammunition. As for the expenses, they will be planned by the counties and districts as a whole. After the military organizations in various districts and townships are enriched, they will be scattered in the villages to maintain local security and protect wartime production. When they are combined, they can take on guerrilla warfare and assist the regular army in formal operations.

### Japanese and Puppet Governments Poison Yangzhou, Opium Dens are Everywhere

Huaiyin Correspondence: Since Yangzhou fell last year, the people have been squeezed by the Japanese and puppet governments, as if in a hell on earth. Recently, rampant bandits have emerged one after another. Now the Japanese army is trying to poison the entire Jiangdu with vicious means. Opium dens have been set up everywhere in the city, almost everywhere. They are divided into grades and receive donations on a monthly basis. Ordinary petty criminals and hooligans mix in there day and night. There are more than 500 opium dens in the whole city, and the poisonous gas is pervasive, making it dark and dark. Wang Pingzhang, the puppet "anti-smoking bureau" chief, also sends his minions to extort money from time to time, threatening to arrest and stop, and the income is huge. Now the Japanese army in Yangzhou is very panicked about supplies and searches the surrounding countryside from time to time, causing the price of rice to be as high as 15 or 6 yuan per stone, and it is still not available. As a result, the lives of the general public are extremely difficult. Under the oppression of the Japanese and puppet governments, they cannot survive and cannot die. Therefore, armed resistance from the people is often heard. Now there is a great internal conflict among the Japanese army. Therefore, Ogawa, the commander of the Japanese army in Yangzhou, has been ordered to be transferred to Nanjing. The captain of the Italian army and the deputy squad leader of the special service squad have also been ordered to be transferred to other places. As for the suburbs, the guerrillas have been unusually active recently, and the Japanese army is panicked. There are fewer than 300 puppet troops stationed in the city. A few days ago, more than 200 people were arrested in the surrounding countryside and detained in the Japanese headquarters, where they were tied up and beaten severely. After being interrogated by the Japanese commander, they were released on bail. Currently, there are still five or six people who have not been released. Therefore, the inspection of pedestrians at the four gates has been very strict recently, and a special curfew is imposed every day at 4 pm to prevent the Chinese guerrillas from attacking.

### Zhejiang Province Re-checks Household Registration, Scheduled to be Held on April 1st

Ningbo Correspondence: The Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province believes that the household registration surveys in this province over the years have not been very accurate, causing difficulties in handling military service in various counties. Now, in order to make a reliable statistic on the ages of Class A and B conscripts, it has been decided to conduct a general household registration re-check throughout the province. The re-check forms have been drafted and issued to the county magistrates of various counties for preparation in advance. On April 1st of this year, the district and township offices and the staff of various agencies and public schools will be mobilized to participate in the re-check in one day.

### Youji Guerrilla War, Japanese Officer Injured, Several Puppet Police Killed

Changshu Correspondence: Xu Fengzao, the commander of the Fourth District of the Puppet Pacification Army, recently recruited more than 90 puppet troops. Two Japanese instructors, Sato and Yamaguchi, took several trucks from Dazhi Company from Wuxi to Yu. When passing through Dongting, they were suddenly attacked by more than 200 people from the Yunlingen unit of the guerrilla team from the side of the Xihu Highway. Bullets rained down. The Japanese officer, Sato, was also injured, and several puppet police were killed. Seven or eight guerrillas were killed, and a truck driver was injured in the foot. After arriving in Changshu, he was sent to the hospital for treatment.

### The Second Year of the War of Resistance, Production and Sales of Sichuan Province Commodities (2) (Continued), Imported Goods are Reduced Due to Transportation Difficulties, Local Products are Still Inevitably Backlogged

Those with more inventory can generally make a profit, but six have closed down due to lack of goods, and more than ten have reduced their scale and changed their brands. However, there are also more than ten silk merchants who have moved to Chongqing from other places. Next is Suzhou goods. The so-called Suzhou goods include foreign goods and Guangdong goods. Four or five years ago, it was a very prosperous era, with a total annual turnover of more than 8 million yuan. Last year, it was only more than 2 million yuan. The total import volume for the whole year last year was more than 21,900 pieces, and small items sent by mail accounted for one-half. The general price of goods is one-quarter higher than before the war. Woolen products have increased especially. The price before the war was 2.78 yuan per pound, and it has risen to more than 5 yuan after the war. Thermos bottles are very popular. Before the war, each dozen was 11 or 12 yuan, and recently it costs 45 or 6 yuan. Last year, there were more than 130 Suzhou goods shops in the city, and more than 20 Chongqing help merchant houses were all closed. However, more than 30 shops that moved to Chongqing from other places have increased. Each shop has a slight surplus. It is still very difficult to import goods from other provinces this year. It is hoped that the Suzhou goods factories that have moved to Sichuan can quickly produce more goods to meet the needs. It is also hoped that someone can transport a large number of goods to the southwestern provinces for sale. Next is hardware and electrical materials. The monthly import volume before the war was usually 500 tons. After the war, less than 200 tons were transferred and imported through the Yuehan Railway. After the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, it was less than 20 tons per month. However, the total annual turnover last year was more than 4 million yuan, which is one-third more than the previous year. This is purely due to the high price of goods. For example, the price of foreign nails was only 17 or 8 yuan per box before the war. Last year, the highest price rose to 130 yuan, and the current market price is still more than 90 yuan. For example, the price of pig iron was only more than 100 yuan per ton before the withdrawal from Hankou. After the withdrawal from Hankou, it gradually rose to 900 yuan. Recently, it still costs 700 yuan. The general price of goods is three times higher than before the war, and at least one time higher. The most popular ones are pig iron, steel plate, yuan bars, cement steel bones. The most lacking ones are foreign nails, lead wire, steel plate, telephone sets, flower wire, electrical magnetic materials, and bakelite materials. There were more than 40 hardware stores in the city in the previous year, all of which also operated electrical materials. One-quarter of them closed down last year. However, more than ten new ones have moved from Shanghai, Beijing, and Hankou, and all of them have a surplus. The German goods used to be the first in terms of import. After the war, because they had to be transshipped through Hong Kong, the import of British and American goods has also been able to balance with German goods. Next is dried vegetables. The total import volume in the previous year was 20,926 pieces, and only 5,832 pieces last year. The reason for this decline is partly due to transportation difficulties and partly due to the fact that most of the dried vegetables are Japanese goods, which are subject to boycott. The price of goods has increased by more than double compared to before the war. Because most of the goods are not necessities, the business is not as good as other import businesses. Nineteen companies announced their closure last year. This year, due to the reduced sources and the difficulty in sales, I am afraid that there will be more closures. Next is paint. The paint industry in Chongqing, after the exhausted atmosphere of the Italian and Afghan situation in previous years, did not dare to import more. The total import volume in the previous year was 4,500 pieces, and even less last year. The total turnover in the 26th year was 3 million yuan. Although the number was less than in the previous year, the turnover was about the same as in the previous year due to the high price. The general price is more than double compared to before the war. The most popular Quick Indigo Lion Horse Brand had a market price of 4 yuan per catty before the war, and it rose to about 8.5 yuan last year. But there are also those that are several times higher. For example, black indigo powder had a market price of only 80 yuan before the war, and the highest price rose to 450 yuan last year, and recently it has fallen to 370 or 80 yuan. The paint market has always been controlled by four foreign companies, German Defu, British Bunny Mun, American Hengxin, and Nanxing. They either set up their own shops in Chongqing or specially contracted local paint shops to act as agents. Last year, many merchants who operated mountain goods and paper also operated paint because they saw that paint was profitable. They either imported goods directly from Shanghai and Hankou or bought them from the city. The foreign companies could no longer control it. Last year, the one that occupied an important position among the imported goods in Chongqing was the rearguard, Western medicine. The total import volume of Western medicine in the entire Sichuan Province in the previous year reached more than 3 million yuan. Last year, it was only more than 1 million yuan. Chongqing's imports accounted for 70 or 80% of the entire Sichuan Province. The general price has increased by about two times, or even three times. For example, soda ash (120 pounds per unit) was only 15 or 6 yuan before the war, and it rose to about 100 yuan after June last year. Due to the difficulty in importing goods, four Western medicine shops with smaller scale have announced their closure. The German Qianxin imported the most goods and made the most profit.

Finally, I would like to tell the readers that the revenue of Chongqing Customs from July 26 to June 27, the first year of the war of resistance, was still more than 4 million. The surface of the market is still very prosperous. The Southwest Association is raising funds of 100,000 yuan from members in Shanghai and Chongqing to set up a local products company to manage the improvement of local products and adjust the production and sales business. Other private organizations that trade in local products and foreign goods are also emerging like mushrooms after a rain. If transportation is fast and supply is unblocked in the future, it will not be difficult to achieve the goal of exchanging what we have for what we do not have to meet the actual needs. (The End)

### Commercial News Financial: Tianjin Group Uses Legal Tender to Buy Gold, Speculation Reaches New Heights, Circulation of Chips Increasingly Scarce, Closing Price at 2,054 Yuan

Yesterday, the cash speculation market showed continued strong gains. This was due to the continued tightening of foreign exchange, coupled with vigorous buying by wealthy merchants and securities firms in this city, as well as groups from the north. However, the morning saw active sales by silver shops and gold firms, which limited the gains. In the afternoon, foreign exchange became even tighter due to the concerted efforts of Western merchant Sassoon, the Tianjin group, and foreign firms, which stirred up sentiment and drove buyers into a frenzy. The Tianjin group continued to buy aggressively, and silver shops became less willing to sell. Although some holders took profits, the supply of circulating chips on the market remained scarce, pushing the price past the 50 yuan mark to close at a high of 2,054 yuan for the day, a sharp increase of 17 yuan. Trading was extremely active, reaching 1,100 taels. Silver jewelry also rose by one yuan accordingly. The customs gold and Sino-British pure gold prices remained unchanged.

Cash Up 17 Yuan

From the morning, securities firms initially bid 2,038 yuan per bar (ten taels), but sellers demanded an additional 40 yuan before agreeing to sell. The two sides haggled until 9:45 AM, when silver shops finally sold 50 taels to securities firms at 2,040 yuan, setting the opening price. After the opening, money changers suddenly rushed to buy, pushing the price higher. Money changers bought 50 taels from silver shops at 42 yuan. Although securities firms continued to buy aggressively, silver shops and cash firms supplied ample amounts, halting the rise and causing a decline. Securities firms bought 50 taels from cash firms and 100 taels from silver shops, both at 40 yuan. Silver shops sold 50 taels each to money changers and the Northern group, both at 38 yuan. During this period, a certain silver shop suddenly bought 100 taels on behalf of a wealthy merchant in this city at the same price, supplied by fellow merchants. Subsequently, a certain gold firm forcefully supplied 100 taels at the same price, all taken in by fellow merchants and clients. At the same price, money changers again bought 50 taels from the gold firm. Near noon, news broke that foreign exchange was tightening again due to the buying by foreign firms, causing sellers to become scarce and prices to rise again. Money changers bought 50 taels from silver shops at 40 yuan for the noon closing price. The situation was relatively calm at the beginning of the afternoon. At 2:15 PM, a certain money changer was first seen buying again on behalf of the Tianjin group, taking 50 taels from fellow merchants at 42 yuan, followed by another 50 taels at 43 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange was being aggressively bought by Western merchant Sassoon, the Tianjin group, and foreign firms, further tightening the market and causing the supply of sellers on the market to become even scarcer, and the price soared. Silver shops traded 50 taels among themselves at 45 yuan. A certain money changer then aggressively bought more than 200 taels on behalf of the Tianjin group, pushing the price from 45 yuan to 54 yuan, all supplied by silver shops and fellow merchants. By 3:40 PM (it was said that sellers were taking profits), sellers, seeing that the foreign exchange tightening had subsided, rushed to sell, but buyers remained on the sidelines, still unable to find counterparties even at 50 yuan. Only one money changer bid at 46-47 yuan, but no trades occurred. Therefore, the evening closing price was the same as the daily high of 2,054 yuan, a 17 yuan increase compared to the previous day, marking the third consecutive day of gains, totaling 35 yuan. The selling price of the cash firms' own brand of gold was 2,060 yuan, with a buying price of 2,045 yuan. Spot gold was quoted about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, but no trades occurred.

Ornamental Gold at 208 Yuan

The exchange price of silver jewelry had not changed initially, but when speculation again passed the 50 yuan mark at 3:15 PM in the afternoon, the price increased by one yuan. Da Tong Heng, Lao Qing Yun, and other shops raised their prices to 208 yuan, while newer shops raised theirs to 206 yuan, with a buying price of 200 yuan.

Pure Gold Tends to Stagnate

A Reuters dispatch from London on the 2nd reported that the price of English pure gold remained unchanged at £7, 8 shillings, and 7.5 pence per ounce, leaving the Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash at 1,213 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price of customs gold remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 7 li. The Shanghai standard gold bar price also remained unchanged at 1,208 yuan and 6 jiao.

### Silver Bars Level

A Reuters dispatch from London on the 2nd reported limited trading by speculators buying and selling, with a generally flat market. After closing, the market remained flat. Some in India wanted to sell at a price 0.0625 higher than the listed price. Near-term and long-term silver bars remained unchanged. A New York silver dispatch reported that the price of American silver remained stagnant. A Bombay silver dispatch reported that the Indian silver market was calm, with spot, near-term, and long-term prices all up one anna.

### North China Restricts Legal Tender Circulation, Wealthy Buy Foreign Currency, Market Prices Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the prices of English pure gold and Anglo-American exchange rates remained unchanged. Foreign exchange was in high demand by foreign firms, and Japanese banks continued to buy relentlessly. Although the supply of foreign currency continued unabated, domestic demand still exceeded supply, leading to weaker market prices. Speculation in legal tender was strong due to the weakness in foreign exchange. Hong Kong firms bought in the beginning, and Tianjin firms collected later, leading to soaring market prices, as predicted. Because legal tender chips were scarce, they were easily manipulated. Occasional purchases by large players caused market prices to soar. Now, the puppet organizations in North China, acting as henchmen, are working hard to undermine the legal tender. It is said that circulation will be suspended starting next month. Wealthy individuals are panicked and are vigorously buying cash for hoarding, not seeking the revitalization of industry, but always acting out of unconscious blind obedience. Therefore, wealthy individuals are also buying foreign currency vigorously, with heavy trading in British and American gold pounds and British and American gold notes. Supply is not smooth, and market prices are rising sharply, showing a strong trend. Trading at the guild was not active, with only Yong Feng selling and San Tai buying 50 pounds of English gold notes. Qin Tai sold and Tong Shuang bought 50 pounds of English gold notes. Yesterday's market prices: English gold pounds rose 5 jiao and 5 fen, English gold notes rose 2 jiao and 7 fen, American gold pounds rose 4 jiao, American gold notes rose 4 fen and 7 li, Hong Kong notes rose 1 fen and 4 li, French franc notes rose 1.5 li, Singapore notes rose 2 fen, Dutch notes fell 1 fen, rupee notes rose 2.5 fen, Canadian notes rose 4 fen, Australian gold notes rose 2 jiao. Only Annam notes, Italian notes, German gold notes, and Siamese notes remained unchanged.

### Discount Levels

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange draft bills was slightly weak but ultimately leveled out, ranging from 36 yuan to 36.5 yuan per thousand, with the final rate at 36.5 yuan, the same as the previous day.

### Foreign Exchange Buying More Intense, Chinese and Western Merchants Compete to Buy, Conditions Tighten Step by Step, Tianjin Foreign Banks Also Wire to Buy

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw Chinese and Western speculators and foreign firms like Sassoon competing to buy. It was also heard that Tianjin foreign banks wired to buy in order to offset the legal tender balances of Tianjin banks. The supply of Hong Kong telegrams was also weak, causing underlying conditions to continue to soften. Midday fluctuations remained significant, and trading was brisk. The Hong Kong exchange rate tightened step by step as money changers were not eager to sell and various foreign banks were actively buying. The shilling weakened to 8.25 pence, and the US exchange rate was 16.09375 yuan.

In the morning, London silver bars were generally level for both near-term and long-term contracts, the New York silver price was unchanged, London raw gold did not change, the Anglo-American exchange rate was the same, the Anglo-French rate was a small 3 centimes, the Anglo-Shanghai rate was level, the US-Anglo rate fell 0.0625, the US-French rate fell 0.1875, and the US-Shanghai rate fell 5 fen. The exchange rates listed by the Central Bank were stagnant as before. At the opening, banks quoted a spot selling price of 8.296875 pence for the English exchange rate and 16.1875 yuan for the US exchange rate, a decrease of 0.015625 compared to the previous closing price for English exchange and the same for US exchange. After the opening, Hong Kong telegrams were first sold to Hua Bi, Youli, and Mai Jiali English gold at 8.296875 and 8.28125 pence, and to Youli American Bank US exchange at 16.1875 yuan, with the situation generally level. The HSBC listing and the revelation of the silver balance tax remained unchanged. Later, foreign firms aggressively bought American Bank US exchange at only 16.15625 yuan, and bought only HSBC English gold at 8.28125 pence. In addition, Dutch Anda also bought Hong Kong exchange from money changers, shrinking it from 56 yuan to 55.75 yuan. After this, underlying conditions were quite weak. At the noon close, banks quoted a selling price of 8.28125 pence for the English exchange rate and 16.15625 yuan for the US exchange rate.

In the afternoon market, foreign firms came to buy HSBC English gold paper at 8.25 pence. In addition, Tianjin foreign banks also bought from foreign banks at the same price. Western merchant Sassoon also followed suit, buying English gold from Chinese yarn and cotton firms at 8.25 pence and US exchange at 16.125 yuan, making the process increasingly weak. Later, Hong Kong telegrams were again offered to American Bank Datong US exchange at 16.125 yuan, so the situation was slightly level. The Hong Kong exchange rate was increasingly solid as Hua Yi Anda competed to buy from money changers at only 55.35 and 55.25 yuan, causing the market price to become more solid. At the evening close, banks quoted a selling price of 8.25 pence for the English exchange rate and 16.09375 yuan for the US exchange rate, resulting in a decrease of 0.0625 for English exchange and a tightening of 0.09375 for US exchange compared to the previous close. Hong Kong exchange also shrank by 0.75.

### North-South Goods: Dried Lily Flowers Sales Sluggish

Sales of dried lily flowers have been sluggish recently due to weak demand, and goods from Jiangbei have continued to arrive, causing prices to weaken. Top-grade, plump, and brightly colored flower strips, which previously opened at 39 yuan, only saw slight transactions yesterday. Approximately 22 packages were sold, opening at 35.5 yuan, a drop of about 4 yuan. Top-grade wholesale prices were quoted at 35-36 yuan, with subsequent prices ranging from 32 yuan to 22-23 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Chaoqing Prices Exceptionally Firm

Yesterday, the sugar guild quoted a price of 23.9 yuan for spot #24 Dutch coarse white, down slightly by 0.1 yuan. Taikoo cart white B mark was priced at 23.5 yuan. According to a Shantou dispatch regarding domestic sugar, demand from Tianjin and other areas had not weakened, making Chaoqing the firmest. The price for premium Chaoqing was quoted at 14.6 yuan, Huanggang Qing at 14.2-3 yuan, Shangzhi red at 15 yuan, and both Zhiyang Qi white and Sanjian white were in short supply at around 24 yuan, deterring Shanghai firms from buying. Yesterday, 160 bags of sugar arrived from Shantou.

### Industrial and Commercial Discussion: The Pound Revolution and its Impact

— Fan

London is the capital of the world's gold market and the center of international finance. This superior position has created the pound's leading position in the world's currency market. However, it has now become one of the main factors trampling on the pound. As world gold prices have soared due to the preparations for war in various countries, the pound has been held back by exchange rates and cannot keep up. This has turned into a drop in the domestic value of the pound. In addition, the British treasury has turned from a surplus to a deficit in recent years, and foreign trade and international payments have also experienced deficits. The pound's external value is also severely weak; how can it withstand the pressure from rising gold prices?

Now, British Chancellor Simon has asked Congress to revalue the Bank of England's reserve value and decided to estimate it once a week based on the market price. The proceeds from the valuation will be used as a foreign exchange fund. As for the bank's banknote issuance, he has requested that it be reduced from 400 million pounds to 300 million pounds and fixed at this amount, without increases or decreases.

This measure is a major revolution in the British monetary system. The Bank of England's reserves have been legally valued at 85 shillings per ounce for more than 200 years and have never changed. Now, not only is this legal price being abandoned, but it is also being estimated once based on the market price. Therefore, the higher the price of gold, the greater the value of the British reserves or foreign exchange fund. Of course, this can make the pound's position more solid. The London Times called this method the "market price gold standard," which will become a brand new term in modern monetary science.

Furthermore, the Bank of England's banknote issuance has increased or decreased depending on the amount of cash reserves. If the amount of reserves is estimated based on the market price, the issuance of banknotes will inevitably increase today with rising gold prices. With increased banknote issuance, gold prices will naturally be affected by the increase in currency and rise. Therefore, it has now been decided that the total amount of banknote issuance shall not exceed 300 million pounds. Thus, the total amount of issuance has become fixed, and the amount of issuance reserves is transferred due to the market price. This is exactly the opposite of before. This is truly a new revolution for the pound.

What impact will this revolution have on gold prices and the pound exchange rate in the future? In our view, it can generally stabilize soaring gold prices and weak pound exchange rates for a while.

Because the Bank of England's banknote issuance has been reduced to 300 million pounds, it can first benefit from contracting the currency, making the pound firmer and restricting gold prices. Furthermore, revaluation directly strengthens the foreign exchange fund and indirectly enhances the UK's financial credit, so the pound's position can naturally be expected to improve. Therefore, people who buy gold out of suspicion of the pound can be reduced, and the speculative fever in the gold market can of course also be reduced. Therefore, the London gold market should be able to stabilize temporarily.

### Securities: Unified Class A Leads Strongly, China Bookstore and China Merchants Electric, No One Willing to Sell at the Bid Price

The securities gray market remained extremely firm yesterday. Although there were fluctuations in the middle, the bulls ultimately prevailed. This price increase was due to the authorities using facts to dispel rumors, and also due to an increase of ten in the number of Class A lottery tickets, totaling 24. When the rumors were rampant, they forgot where their benefits lay, and when the rumors subsided, they were startled and rushed in. Therefore, the price increase of Class A was particularly strong, and other types also soared accordingly, and the trend should be firm.

Yesterday, after the initial opening, retail investors, Hengdehao, and Tianshenghao bought successively and gradually raised prices. Xie Dahao and No. 11 sold in the middle, causing a slight setback, but Class A remained firm as ever. As a result of the half-day, the price continued to rise by several jiao to more than one yuan. Trading was relatively weak in the afternoon. No. 11 and Xie Dahao suddenly covered their short positions, and Xinfengyong and retail investors also bought. The market continued to be firm. Only Tongkanghao, Dafenghao, and No. 5 slightly divested in the market. Class C and Class E saw the most trading for the day, Class A's price was the loosest, and Class D saw no trading. As a result, prices unanimously continued to rise by 6 jiao to 1.25 yuan, with a total trading volume of approximately 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading remained lackluster. China Bookstore shares were bid at 24.1 yuan, and China Merchants Electric shares were bid at 5 yuan, but there were no sellers.

London's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt on the 2nd of this month (Thursday) improved slightly, but market sentiment remained weak. Senior debt, English gold liquidation bonds, English issued debt notes, and Clipper bonds each rose by half a pound, with the former priced at 47 pounds and the latter at 33.5 pounds. English-German continued loans and English issued debt notes fell by half a pound to a price of 69.5 pounds. Junior railway bonds saw very little change. German-issued with imprint debt notes for the Hukuang Railway rose by 2 pounds to 22 pounds. Longhai Railway bonds rose by half a pound to 13 pounds. The rest were flat. The supply of physical goods in England was still not quiet. 5,000 pounds (equivalent to 25,000 US dollars) of Sino-French-American 5% bonds were sold at 68 pounds, at a parallel market price. 2,000 pounds of English gold liquidation bonds with German imprint debt notes were sold at 43.5 pounds, a drop of 15 shillings from the previous day. 2,000 pounds of Russian issued with imprint debt notes were sold at 42.5 pounds, which had not been opened for a long time and could not be compared. 5,000 pounds of Hukuang Railway bonds without German imprint debt notes were sold at 22 pounds and 5 shillings, a raise of 5 shillings on the market. 1,500 pounds of German issued with imprint lottery tickets were sold at 20.5 pounds, a drop of 1.5 pounds on the market. 1,000 pounds each of Tianjin-Pukou Railway original bonds with German imprint debt notes and German imprint lottery tickets, and 3,000 pounds of continued issued bonds with German imprint debt notes, were sold at 16.5 pounds, a raise of half a pound on the market. 2,000 pounds of Guangdong-Kowloon Railway bonds were sold at 18 pounds and 5 shillings, a slight raise of 5 shillings on the market.

London's listed prices for English East Asian company shares on the 2nd of this month (Thursday) saw mixed ups and downs. Mercantile Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 9 pounds and 5 shillings. HSBC Hong Kong registered shares fell by half a pound to 86 pounds. Kailuan Mining unregistered shares rose by 3 pence to 16 shillings and 9 pence. Gula Keling Bangdi leather shares rose by 7.5 pence to 19 shillings and 4.5 pence. The rest were flat. The supply of physical goods in England was said to include the sale of 3,000 pounds of Australian Mining Bureau 6% English gold debt notes.

### Grain: Flour and Wheat Supply and Demand Both Low, Already Showing Signs of Year's End

The flour market continued to be firm and stable. Transactions remained low. Northern firms have recently started selling lower-grade flour, but demand for #2 flour remains weak. This is because the supply of foreign flour from Tianjin is constant, so large firms cannot expand their sales. Southern firms are also only adding small amounts based on ship locations. A total of more than 20,000 bags were transacted in the market, still sold in small quantities by local and Northern-Southern firms. The price of #2 flour from cars and ships held at 4.8 yuan. There were no transactions for medium-grade and mixed brands. Today, there are 2,500 bags of flour being transported to Weihaiwei, 4,500 bags to Yantai, and 6,500 bags to the Tianjin area.

The wheat market remained quiet. Due to the approaching Lunar New Year, there were fewer vendors from various sources, and most trading was expected after the Lunar New Year. Purchases by various factories were also very sparse, and the market was even quieter. A total of 4,000 bags of wheat from Jiangbei Wuhu were sold in the market, with the Fuxin and Fushuang factories each buying half. The highest price was 6.55 yuan. The market already shows signs of winding down.

### Ke Xian Du Rice Slight Drops

Ke Xian rice has been arriving continuously in recent days. Both car and boat routes have only had small batches arriving. Among them, 1,150 bags came from Hupu, replenishing the bottom stock. The exit route has long lacked large firms and buyers, relying only on local small batches, which is difficult to sustain for long. Therefore, the prices of high-quality goods unanimously weakened by 0.05-0.06 yuan yesterday. High-quality Jing Xian was only 10.075 yuan, large market Wu Xian was 10.03-0.04 yuan, and medium-quality prices varied. A total of more than 800 bags were transacted in the market.

With sales of domestic rice sluggish, buyers want to lower prices, which seems to be declining. Extended to the evening market, seeing that river goods had not arrived and there were only more than 4,000 bags by car and boat, sentiment turned firmer. Sellers were holding on firmly, and the market turned stable. However, the prices of various goods varied due to different thoughts of the sellers. Chang Xieng geng depreciated by 0.05 yuan, and Su Tong geng held the original price, while some depreciated by 0.02-0.03 yuan. Bo Cheng depreciated by 0.1 yuan due to limited exit routes. Du Yang and Jian Bu Jian were also not consistently weak. With supply and demand approximately equal, no significant changes were seen.

### Miscellaneous Grains Trading Gradually Cooling, Closing Period Coming Soon

Miscellaneous grains have entered the closing phase and there will probably be no major changes within the year. Yesterday's market was even more desolate. A total of 300 bags of Chongming sand yellow and more than 100 bags of Wuhu beans were transacted in the market. Other than that, there were only more than 300 bags of cowpea transacted the night before. The market sentiment for red beans was down 0.03-0.04 yuan compared to the previous market, because arrivals were surging and sales were slack. Currently, Ben Niu goods opened at 9.2 yuan, Jiangbei goods at 7.02 yuan, and Nanjing goods at 6.63 yuan. The exit route was Guangshan and Liangbang.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Prices Soar for Several Days, White Factory Prices at 1,500 Yuan, Up 900 Yuan Since August 13

Foreign silk markets are in a surge. Yesterday, Lyon market prices rose uniformly across all categories. Japanese silk rose 2 francs, Shanghai silk A rose 1 franc, B rose 2 francs, Guangdong silk rose 1 franc, Yokohama spot prices retreated slightly by 7 yuan, forward contracts rose 1 yuan, New York Japanese silk and Chinese silk rose 0.01 to 0.02 yuan, exchange recent rise of 0.02 yuan, the forward contract was the original plate of the previous day,

The Shanghai silk market is in high spirits. Buyers and factory silk market sentiment changed from firm to stagnant. Foreign firms were looking for 7/8 White factories to start sending messages to sell and collect, and manufacturers asked for 1,500 yuan. They want to see the situation of the foreign market today and predict that the domestic and foreign market prices must be at least 50-60 yuan apart. Users' market situation, hoarders, and silk mills have shifted their target to Ji Bi Jing, because Ji Li Jing market prices have not yet risen to the extreme point. Yesterday, I heard that Qilin Racecourse Ji Li Silk, yesterday, users made 870 yuan, which is a huge increase of 50 yuan. Looking at the silk prices in recent times, taking White Factory B as the standard, it has risen by 900 yuan compared with the lowest price after August 13.

### Seafood: Wenzhou Tails Sold Yesterday

Wenzhou shrimp tails had been out of stock, and a batch has recently arrived. Yesterday, a certain store opened 29 pieces, priced at 76 to 73 yuan, which is quite suitable for small street sales because they are small.

### Medicinal Materials: Chao Tangerine Peel Weak and Cannot Rise, Only 8.5 Yuan Yesterday

The local base for Chao tangerine peel is thick, and similar products from other ports are coming in from all over the place, resulting in an oversupply. The price has successively fallen from over 20 yuan to 16-17 yuan. Yesterday, a certain store sold more than 20 pieces for only 8.5 yuan.

Silkworm Industry

### Why Have Recent Silk Prices Risen Excessively?

— (Xiao He)

In the past two weeks, domestic and foreign silk prices have been reporting increases in both the East and West, as if the golden age of the silk industry has reappeared today due to the baptism of artillery fire. As a result, optimistic air has muddled people's minds, creating a distorted domestic demand in the last few weeks' external sales of "door can Luoque". What is expressed in silk prices is the hundred yuan difference between domestic and foreign silk prices, and what is expressed in sales is that the way out for raw silk is to invest in the arms of hoarders. As a result, this major export that adjusts international trade has not only lost the possibility of earning foreign exchange, but also made the raw material costs for silk weaving factories that operate miserably on the isolated island after the war heavier. There is no doubt that it is digging many traps that can destroy itself for the silk industry itself. However, what is the reason that silk prices have risen so excessively? This can be explained from two aspects.

First, let's take a look at the recent situation in the world silk market.

Japan, which accounts for more than 70% of the world's silk production, had a 12.5% reduction in raw silk production last year in the "national crisis" of its aggressive war. This year, when the second phase of the war of resistance is launched, undoubtedly, it will inevitably show further dryness and depression in any department within the country. This point guarantees that this year's world silk market will be affected by the lack of raw materials.

The second point is that because Japan reduced silkworm rearing last year, the existing cocoons could not connect to the new cocoons produced. As a result, some Japanese silk factories switched to making fine striped silk products to delay the day, which caused a surplus of 13-15 striped raw silk in the United States or the Japanese mainland, and an insufficient supply of 20-22 striped raw silk. This has made the price of 20-22 striped silk surpass the price of fine striped silk in the market, which has promoted the abnormal development of silk prices in the world's major raw silk markets. (According to the Reuters report on raw silk market prices, in recent weeks, the price of 20-22 striped silk has been 0.01-0.03 yuan higher than the price of 13-15 striped silk, which can confirm this statement.)

The third point is the export of high-quality dry cocoons and the use of low-quality dry cocoons as wool substitutes to weave military uniforms, etc. under the reduction of cocoon collection in Japan. The former is due to the need for raw materials from German silk factories and the Japanese demand for German-made aggressive munitions. The second part is that Japan plans to save wool to save its dwindling foreign exchange. As a result, a double raw material shortage was created, which directly stimulated the flying purchase of international silk prices. (To be continued)

### Yarn Flowers: Banks Purchase Yarn and Transport It South for Sale, Present Yarn Market Returns to Good Condition, Japanese Yarn Also Sees Purchases for Speculation

The yarn market's rise is slow. Forwarders and small investors are not interested in stocking up for the New Year, to avoid capital pressure. Market prices are slightly better, with goods being released based on market prices. However, banks in this port have recently not stopped purchasing cotton textiles and are buying spot goods for transport to and sale in Huainan, coastal defense areas, and Kunming, etc., where the profits are relatively high. This has further stirred market confidence. At the same time, although other trading groups do not show signs of bulk wholesale expansion, sporadic transactions are also more active than in the past few days, so market prices have turned for the better.

The spot yarn market opened this morning with telegrams from customers in other provinces requesting goods from Shanghai, so market sentiment was particularly high. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at an additional 2.5 yuan, at 397 yuan. The Fujian group bought 45 bales, and soon there were more sellers, dropping back by 1.5 yuan. Financial institutions continued to buy, recovering the price. The inland groups showed interest in yarn of heavy weight, with 280 bales of 20-count Special Jincheng brand being purchased. At closing, small investors sold, falling back by 1 yuan. Double Horse was at 396 yuan. The morning's transaction volume totaled 981 bales, with inter-dealer transactions still accounting for half. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 1.5 yuan higher than the previous day, Special Jincheng rose 5 yuan, Double Globe rose 4 yuan, Heavenly Girl rose 2.5 yuan, Shepherd rose 1.5 yuan, 18-count Heavenly Girl rose 3 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn also rose 2-3 yuan. The Yong'an Factory opened 280 bales of 20-count Special Jincheng at prices from 395 yuan to 398 yuan. Inland groups took it. Spot sales and exports included 150 pieces transported to Ningbo. The market breakdown is listed below:

Inland 280  Dealers 475

Fujian 40 Shantou 51

Ningbo 20 Yunnan 25

Jiangxi 50 Xiamen 20

Hong Kong 20 Total 981

Although the Japanese yarn market is light on transactions, the consecutive days of sharp declines have prompted a major yarn firm to buy in and speculate, so market prices have rebounded by 4-5 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 321 yuan to 325 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 316 yuan to 320 yuan. However, due to the squeezing experienced last month, everyone is wary of next month's "ball skin" business and no one dares to do it at present.

### American Cotton Sees Mixed Price Fluctuations, Local Transactions Are Virtually Stalled

The price of foreign cotton in New York initially rose due to purchases by dealers, then fell due to hedging sales in the South and selling in New Orleans. Washington has not made any progress, and because everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude, the market is increasingly sluggish. Yesterday in New York, prices rose and fell. The Indian market was quiet, with forecasts unchanged. The Egyptian cotton market fell 5-6 pound sounds. Exchange rates were still weak yesterday, and converted into legal tender, cotton prices all rose, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton rising 2 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rising 1 jiao, and Egyptian cotton also rising 2 jiao.

Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai are quite quiet. Recently, due to the approaching end of the year and sluggish sales of yarn and cloth, a large batch of foreign cotton ordered by various factories has arrived in Shanghai in recent days. Moreover, ordering foreign cotton requires a 20% deposit. All Chinese factories do not plan to order during the lunar new year, so foreign cotton transactions must wait until the lunar new year. Yesterday's transactions were silent. The prices of foreign cotton are listed below:

Foreign Cotton Converted Market Prices

Local cotton business is becoming more and more depressed, due to seasonal factors. The lunar new year closing period is approaching, and all parties are busy with closing operations and are in a relaxed state. Transactions are becoming scarce. Since factories have ordered Indian and American cotton in large quantities, their intake of local cotton is very narrow. Therefore, market prices have recently been somewhat weak. The only robust supply is from northern Jiangsu. 1,220 bales of Tonghua arrived, 1,240 pieces from Funing, 450 pieces from Beisha, and 250 pieces from Baimao Qiya. The market situation is recorded as follows:

Yesterday, only the local street slightly added to the purchases of Dongpi fine cloth and fine twill, with transactions of less than 300 pieces. The Tianjin group was disinterested and had no appetite. Major dealers were in high spirits, not without the intention to loosen sales, and there were those who were discreetly absorbing goods. However, ordinary brokers who only enter and exit the market have no capital to support and are reducing prices to sell. Therefore, the spot market price of fine cloth and fine twill has fallen by about 5 fen per piece. The prices of colored goods such as Four Gentlemen and Zhigong have risen due to shortages, and they are now selling for 4 jiao per yard, and serge for 3 jiao 9 and a half fen.

Today, 470 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin, 420 pieces to Shanghai-Yantai, 50 pieces to Weihaiwei, and 520 pieces to Ningbo.

### Miscellaneous: Tin Foil Origin Prices High

Since entering the peak season, the selling price of tin foil has remained at the original level due to ample supply. Recently, due to increased raw material and labor costs in the production area, the wholesale price in the production area has been steadily raised. Moreover, wholesale prices in other ports have also continued to rise. Because the sales in this city are active, the industry has decided to increase the price by 1 jiao per strip and 4 fen per piece in order to maintain costs, and sales started at the new price the day before yesterday.

### Metals: A Large Batch of Metal Orders Placed

Recently, metal transactions have been relatively active. The inventory in this port has been almost exhausted. Spot goods such as thick gauge white lead, eighteen gauge black iron sheet, 36-inch Yellow Eagle brand, Da Guangpi, Dutch tin, thin iron, 100-pound tinplate, green lead, iron, small patterned bamboo steel bars, etc. are all in short supply. Dealers are placing orders for futures from overseas, so a large batch has been ordered in recent days.

### Piece Goods: Profits Expected After the New Year, Hoarders Continue to Search for Cheap Goods, Tianjin Group Is Disinterested in Dongpi

Domestic cloth sales are more active in Kunming, Shantou, and Quanzhou. There are still small purchases in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, northern Jiangsu, and inland areas. Local hoarders in this city continue to search for cheap goods, mostly believing that buying at bargain prices now will bring profits after the New Year. However, second-hand goods are not sold cheaply because factories are asking high prices for February futures. They hold out against each other, and the market is generally stable. The Shantou group purchased 60-70 packages of 12-pound and 11-pound fine cloth from underwear factories, and nearly 100 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and printed cloth. The Sichuan group purchased 800 pieces of colored cloth and foreign yarn. The Yunnan group continued to purchase more than 50 boxes of colored cloth, printed cloth, satin, Zhigong, hemp yarn, and bleached cloth. The Wen and Yong groups only made sporadic additions, about 100 pieces of colored cloth, factory cloth, coarse cloth, and twill. Northern Jiangsu and inland Zhejiang and Jiangxi purchased several thousand pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, serge, line tweed, bleached cloth, poplin, and patterned goods in small quantities from wholesale dealers in this city. The Hong Kong group and local merchants purchased 60-70 pieces of dyed greige fine twill. The Min group purchased more than 100 boxes of serge, line tweed, colored cloth, and colored twill. Small Luzon and Singapore continued to purchase goods.

### Japanese Side Sets Deadline, Forcing Foreigners to Leave Kuling, Foreigners' Houses Are Not Protected At All, It Is Still Undecided Whether They Will Be Escorted to Xunyang

The Continental Daily reports that the Japanese authorities in this port announced yesterday (2nd) that 65 foreigners in Kuling will have to find a way to leave the mountain within a week. We reap what we sow. The Japanese side has submitted the notification regarding this move to the consular authorities in this port. However, according to the Japanese side's statement at a reception for reporters last night, they have not yet received a reply. The deadline for foreigners to leave Kuling has been set by the Japanese army as

February 10. Furthermore, according to the Japanese military spokesman, foreigners must notify the Japanese military authorities of the date and time of their departure before leaving the area. More importantly, foreigners must depart during the day and travel in groups. Those who do not travel in groups will face significant danger. The spokesman further explained in response to a reporter's question that because the Japanese army's methods of resisting guerrillas

will become more intense, there is significant danger. It is said that there are 4,000-5,000 Chinese troops around the mountain. A reporter asked if his answer meant that after the evacuation of the foreigners, indiscriminate bombing would be carried out. The spokesman replied that they would do their best to avoid damaging foreign property, but if the Chinese army occupies the buildings after the evacuation of the foreigners, the "responsibility will be borne by Chongqing." A reporter asked

whether foreigners should not open their residences after evacuation, so that they would not be possibly occupied by the army and damaged. The spokesman replied that evacuating foreigners would protect their lives, because foreign property is clearly marked with national flags and the location of their property has been notified to the Japanese side. There is no reason for it to be damaged in combat. The spokesman further stated that the Chinese army had previously used foreign property for military purposes.

The Japanese side had obtained information that Chinese guerrillas in the Lushan area used the houses of evacuated foreigners as barracks. The Japanese Navy intends to provide evacuated foreigners with transportation to Jiujiang, but this cannot be stated definitively yet because the date of departure has not been determined. This matter must be decided by the foreigners in Kuling themselves. Considerable consideration will be given to the transportation of sick foreigners, but if there are sick foreigners who

cannot move, then he cannot say what steps the Japanese side will take. A reporter asked if the Japanese authorities would consider setting up a neutral zone around Kuling so that foreigners would not have to evacuate. The spokesman replied that this was a hypothetical question. After the area is pacified, it will be in the same situation as other Japanese-occupied areas. "Once peace and order are fully restored," residents will be allowed to return to Kuling. Currently, there are

65 foreigners still remaining in Kuling, including 37 British, 12 Americans, and 9 Germans. The rest are from other countries. Most have lived in Kuling for a very long time. Shanghai expressed panic yesterday, because if they have to evacuate, they will lose most of their property, furniture, and other belongings. It was previously known that several sick foreigners were still living in Kuling, but no recent information has been obtained about their condition.

If there are those who are seriously ill and cannot move, a serious situation will arise. It was heard last night that the British and American consulates had submitted the Japanese side's ultimatum to the Hankou office, because Kuling is within the jurisdiction of that office. The Hankou office will notify the Japanese authorities in Shanghai after deciding on a plan.

### Shanghai Stores 700,000 Bags of Rice, Food Supply Is Secure, Smuggling of National Rice for Export Is Rampant

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association is doing its best to smooth the supply and stabilize market prices in order to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents. Now the national rice produced in the Changshu, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Songjiang, Qingpu, and Hupu rice producing areas has been purchased in large quantities by the Japanese side and smuggled to North China and the Guandong area. The total amount has exceeded 1 million dan, causing the stockpiles in the producing areas to gradually thin out and the prices to rise, affecting the entire food supply. A reporter from the New Sound Society learned from the market yesterday that since Shanghai banned the re-export of national rice, merchants from North China have colluded with the Japanese to directly purchase from the producing areas and transport it to the Hongkou district of Shanghai by small steamships and then load it onto Japanese ships for transport north. However, under the special circumstances in Shanghai, suppression is difficult. If this continues, it will inevitably affect the food supply in Shanghai. As for the current rice reserves in Shanghai, including the warehouses of various banks and rice dealers, the total is 700,000 bags, each bag containing one shi and two and a half dou, enough to supply Shanghai's food needs for two and a half months. Moreover, the rice boats arriving from the river and those transported by small steamships or trains are sufficient to meet the daily consumption of the people of Shanghai. Therefore, there is no fear of a shortage of food in Shanghai for the time being. There may be a fear of shortage during the transition period, but because Shanghai's transportation is convenient, foreign rice can be telegraphed in if necessary. However, there is deep concern that rice prices will rise in the future. Although the Shanghai rice market limits the maximum price to no more than 14 yuan per shi in national currency, the current wholesale price of the top grade is 12 yuan and 6 jiao.

### The Japanese Side Again Instigates Puppets, Manufacturing a Peace Movement, Representatives of North and South Puppet Organizations Meet in Nanjing, The Japanese Side's Exhaustion and Inability to Continue the War Is Evident

Recently, because the Japanese side is deeply mired in the war against China and feels unable to extricate itself, its desire for peace is extremely urgent. It had previously attempted to promote peace talks led by Wang Jingwei, but was severely rejected by the central authorities and unanimously condemned by the people of the whole country, resulting in failure and complete disillusionment. As a result, the Japanese side is anxious and distressed, its plans exhausted and weaknesses increasingly exposed. Therefore, it tried every means to win over Wu Peifu, urging him to come out of retirement and giving him the position of "Chairman of the Pacification Committee," hoping that Wu would carry out the peace movement. However, Wu, aware of the treacherous scheme, was unmoved, while the Japanese side actually sang and acted on its own, creating an atmosphere and confusing people. At the same time, the puppets in the North and South puppet governments and the Central China and South China puppet organizations, in order to please their "masters," also ran around shouting and begging for peace, and decided to convene a "joint meeting" in Nanjing yesterday. It is calculated that Wang Kemin, Wang Yitang, etc. attended from North China, Chen Zhongfu attended on behalf of Central China, Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, etc. from "Vichy," and a Peng official, the president of the fake "Guangzhou Autonomous Association" attended from South China. The fake "Shanghai Municipal Government" sent Wang Changchun to attend. According to sources, the content of the meeting will discuss the establishment of political sub-associations in various places and earnestly urge Wu Peifu to come out of retirement to lead the "Peace and National Salvation Movement." The donkey's tricks are exhausted, which is evident here.

### Foreign Media Report That the Japanese Side Is Trying to Entice Wu Peifu to Take the Stage, Planning to Give Him Troops to Rule South of the Yellow River, Wu Has Decided Not to Be Moved by the Unilateral Plan

The Continental Daily reports that yesterday afternoon (2nd), reliable Chinese sources in this port stated that representatives of the Japanese government are prepared to hand over all Japanese-occupied areas south of the Yellow River to Wu Peifu for "management," and provide him with troops so that he has the power to "manage." It is said that the Japanese authorities made this new plan to withdraw Japanese troops to fight in the north. Once Wu's "troops" are formed, and at least when they have overcome local opposition and are sufficient to maintain his power, the main force of the Japanese army will withdraw. However, this port believes that the claim that the Japanese army will completely withdraw from south of the Yellow River is unlikely. The "troops" in the plan will likely have "advisors" appointed by the Japanese side in major positions. In addition to providing funding initially, the Japanese side may allocate several aircraft for Wu to dispatch to carry out his "peace movement." It is also possible. Translator's note: This is a plan on the Japanese side, and there is no confirmation on whether Wu Peifu will accept it.

According to another report, since the outbreak of the Japanese army's war of aggression against China, the Japanese army has suffered numerous casualties, and its domestic economy is on the verge of collapse. Therefore, it is eager for peace and attempts to create a peace in its favor under the current situation. After the previous Wang Jingwei's betrayal and seeking peace, the Japanese side extensively promoted it in the occupied areas, attempting to deceive the people in the war zone. In recent days, it has also distributed communiques drafted by the Japanese side, not issued by Wu Peifu himself, in the vicinity of Shanghai, attempting to ease the anti-Japanese actions of the people's guerrillas.

### Yu Qiaqing Telegrams the Ministry, Begging to Allow Zhejiang Cotton to Be Transported to Shanghai, To Be Certified by the Chinese Merchants Yarn Factory Joint Association, Clearing Congested Cotton to Rescue Cotton Farmers and Merchants

Yu Qiaqing telegrams the Ministries of Finance and Economy, requesting that Zhejiang cotton be allowed to be transported to Shanghai for sale. He respectfully presents to Minister of Finance Kong and Minister of Economy Weng: According to a telegram from the Ning Shao Area Cotton Transport and Sales Office, the Zhejiang Customs ban on cotton transport to Shanghai was issued in accordance with Finance Ministry Guan Yu Zi No. 5368 telegram, approving the Economy Ministry Xian telegram, requesting that the Customs ban the transport of 54 types of goods to aid the enemy. After a detailed investigation, the prohibited areas mentioned in the Xian telegram should be published by various government agencies and checkpoints in areas that have been known to be controlled by the Japanese through violence before they are designated. The Yong cotton transported to Shanghai enters the public concession, where there are many Chinese merchant yarn factories, and the need is pressing. Moreover, it cannot be controlled by the violence of the Japanese, so it cannot be designated as a prohibited area. Furthermore, according to the Ministry of Finance's plan to promote domestic goods, it has approved the exemption of foreign exchange settlement for 16 categories, including cotton, which is sufficient to prove that Shanghai is not a prohibited area. Moreover, in accordance with the main purpose of the ban, care should be taken to prevent aiding the enemy. Yong cotton is used for spinning coarse yarn and is only needed by Chinese merchant yarn factories. When going to Yong to purchase, permission should first be obtained from Shanghai Fuhua Company, and the Yarn Factory Joint Association should issue a certificate. Upon export, it is strictly inspected by the competent government agency. After being transported to Shanghai, it is verified by the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance and the Zhejiang Provincial Material Adjustment Office, both stationed in Hong Kong, and the procedures are complete, with no suspicion of aiding the enemy. At present, there is congestion of cotton, totaling 240,000 bales in Yong and inland, worth 10 million yuan in national currency. Once the ban is imposed, cotton farmers and merchants will suffer together. How can it be imagined? We earnestly request that the department show compassion and urgently telegram the Zhejiang Customs to allow transport as before, in order to save farmers and merchants, etc. What was stated by He De is true, and because of his relationship with his hometown, he knows that cotton farmers and merchants are in urgent need of transport. If it is prohibited, their livelihood will be cut off, and the danger is worthy of concern. Therefore, he dares to report the situation to the highest level, hoping that the higher authorities will show compassion and quickly order the Zhejiang Customs to investigate the actual situation and allow the existing cotton in Yong to be transported to Shanghai in order to save farmers and merchants and avoid suffering. He is infinitely grateful and hopes for this to the utmost. Yu He De bows.

The total number of various motor vehicles was 9,681 (excluding those used by the armed forces of various countries and various departments of this bureau).

The number of accidents noted by the police or reported directly to the police in the past three years is as follows:

The streets south of the Suzhou River are extremely crowded, and there are a large number of refugees who are new to Shanghai and do not understand traffic conditions. This is the reason for the increase in fatal accidents. Of the above-mentioned deaths, 134 died in the Central and Western districts, and the rest died in the Northeast districts. (End)

### Small Steamer Sinking Location, Jiang Customs Strictly Orders Attention

The small steamer Zizaiwen outside of Wenzhou sunk after a hanging board broke. The ship has not yet been salvaged. Regarding the location of the wreck, the Jiang Customs has been reported by the Zhen Customs to be surveyed. The coordinates are at 28 degrees 16 minutes north latitude and 121 degrees 28 minutes and 5 seconds east longitude. The ship's two masts and smokestack are still above the water, which is extremely dangerous. The Jiang Customs has issued a notice to all shipowners operating between Shanghai and Wenzhou, ordering them to pay close attention to avoid accidents.

### The Central Government Orders Each Province's Anti-Japanese and Defense Associations to Conduct Registration of Intellectual Youth, To Be Handled by the Party and Government Organs of Each Province

In view of the fact that since the War of Resistance, there have been many intellectual youths in various places who have participated in the anti-Japanese work in the front or rear, and there are also not a few who are still scattered in various places because they are limited by the environment and cannot work. In order to find ways to maintain their livelihoods and increase the strength of the War of Resistance, the Central Party Headquarters has ordered the anti-Japanese and defense associations in each province to conduct registration of intellectual youths. All those who have graduated from junior high school or above or have equivalent academic qualifications, are physically healthy, have no bad habits, believe in the Three Principles of the People, obey the leader, and have the determination to sacrifice for the War of Resistance may participate in the registration. Then, the anti-Japanese and defense association will conduct a qualification examination, provide appropriate training, and then assign them work. After receiving the order, the anti-Japanese and defense associations in each province have entrusted the party and government organs of each province to be responsible for the registration.

### The "Haidar" Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Norwegian Consul Prepares Report; Ship Captains Detail Detention Experience; Founing Shipping Route Forced to be Cut Off

The "Haidar," "Yungzhen," and "Hafa" vessels, on the 28th of last month, were unloading cargo at Hexing Town in Founing when sudden Japanese aircraft appeared and bombed the area. They fled to Yanghekou, but unexpectedly encountered a Japanese warship outside the port and were detained, then forced to sail to Qingdao. After negotiations by British and Norwegian consuls, and the arrival of British warships in Qingdao for rescue, the Japanese side successively released the vessels. The "Yungzhen" and "Hafa" ships returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday, and the "Haidar" also arrived at 5:00 PM yesterday. Upon arrival, the ship reported the detention experience to the company. It was also reported that over two thousand four hundred and fifty pieces of cargo previously shipped to Founing remained unloaded and were brought back on the original ship, along with one thousand two hundred and forty-eight bales of cotton, over one hundred and sixty salted pigs, and over sixty pieces of sundry goods loaded there.

The "Continental Daily" reports that the British ship "Yungzhen" was detained by a Japanese warship and a "Customs" patrol vessel. British authorities are currently conducting a formal investigation. The Norwegian Consulate General is also starting a similar investigation (on the 2nd) regarding the simultaneous detention of the "Hafa" vessel. The "Hafa" vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, docking at floating docks number 25 and 26. The ship's captain, Anderson, immediately went to the Norwegian Consulate General to report the experience in detail and had a lengthy discussion with consulate officials. It was heard yesterday at dusk that the Norwegian Consulate was working on preparing a report, but it had not yet been completed at that time.

"Modern News" reports that cargo transportation on the Shanghai-Founing route has been extremely prosperous. Since the Japanese aircraft bombed Hexing Town on the 26th of last month and the Japanese warships illegally detained three foreign vessels, including the "Yungzhen," shipping on this route has been suspended. Now, after negotiations, the British "Yungzhen" vessel has been released and, upon returning to Shanghai from Qingdao, has decided to switch to the Tianjin route within days. Furthermore, the Norwegian "Hafa" vessel of the Fucheng Company, after returning to Shanghai from Qingdao the day before yesterday, originally intended to resume the Shanghai-Founing route, but due to passenger unwillingness to risk it, it has decided to sail to Fuzhou today or tomorrow. As for the British Kailin Malu vessel, which originally intended to test the Founing route, it now also sees that the situation there is unstable, and that navigation markers at Yanghekou have been removed by guerrillas, making navigation highly dangerous, and therefore has to temporarily abandon the route. In addition, the Norwegian "Haidar" vessel of the Subei Company, released from Qingdao and returned to Shanghai, arrived at the port yesterday and also plans to switch to another route. Therefore, the Founing route is now at a standstill.

### Salary Increase at the Municipal Council Causes Increased Backlash; Detectives Willing to Donate Salaries to Charity

The English "North China Daily News" reports that there are continuing and increasingly visible signs of taxpayers opposing the salary increases for senior officials at the Municipal Council. A reader sent a letter to the newspaper, believing that taxpayers may refuse to pay taxes. Another letter stated that the salary increase funds could be used to support the Salvation Army. Two detectives from the police department suggested that if senior officials donate their salary increases to charity, they would be willing to donate their recent salary increases to assist the International Relief Committee. Meanwhile, the Committee of Businessmen's Representatives remains busy with its unappreciated work. The Municipal Council has scheduled a meeting for next Wednesday, at which time everything may be decided. Furthermore, Japanese newspapers recently reported that the Deputy Chief of Police, Akagi, would distribute his salary increase to low-ranking Japanese personnel in the police department. When the reporter asked Akagi about this, he replied that this must be someone else's suggestion, as he himself had not made this suggestion, and that this action would be ridiculous. Because if his salary increase were distributed, each low-ranking Japanese personnel would only receive slightly more than one yuan.

### Chinese-Owned Textile Mills in War Zones Refuse to Cooperate and Are Plundered by the Japanese; Japanese Monopolize Sales of Yarn and Cloth in Occupied Areas; Cotton in North and Central China Under Japanese Control

Chinese-owned textile mills are mostly concentrated in a few coastal cities and have been severely impacted by the war. Mills in the war zones have refused to cooperate and have been plundered, with machinery being moved without permission. Goods produced by Chinese-owned mills in the concessions rely entirely on consumption in the southwestern provinces. The sale of yarn in Japanese occupied areas is monopolized by the Japanese, and the sales of cotton are also under their control. Detailed information is recorded below.

Thirty-Eight Textile Mills in Operation

Textile mills in Shanghai that are in operation: Chinese-owned - Shenxin No. 2 Textile Mill, Shenxin No. 9 Textile Mill, Xinyu No. 1 Mill, Xinyu No. 2 Mill, Hongzhang Textile Dyeing Mill, Yongan No. 3 Mill, Tongyi Textile Company, Qinfeng Textile Mill, Datong Yarn Mill Co., Ltd., and Heji Zhengye Yarn Mill, totaling ten mills with 354,270 spindles, 31,360 thread spindles, and 1,700 looms, accounting for 32.3% of the original textile mills. British-owned - Jardine, Public, Yangshupu, and Lun Chang, totaling four mills with 40,976 spindles, 2,640 thread spindles, and 3,265 looms. Japanese-owned - Rihua, Shanghai, Naigaiwata, Donghua, Tongxing, Gongda, Dakang, Toyota, Yufeng, etc., totaling twenty-four mills with 1,114,316 spindles, 190,824 thread spindles, and 14,554 looms.

Consumption of Yarn Produced by Chinese, British, and Japanese Mills

Goods produced by Chinese, British, and Japanese mills: Chinese-owned mills rely entirely on consumption in the southwestern provinces. British-owned mills supply the British-owned weaving mills in this city. Japanese yarn is cheaper than Chinese and British yarn, and is supplied to weaving mills in this city for dumping in the occupied areas. Last November, the number of spot yarn transactions in Shanghai: 2,050 bales in Yunnan, 1,994 bales inland, 1,586 bales in Shantou, 1,315 bales in Tianjin, 219 bales in Ningbo, 350 bales from the Northern Gang, 394 bales in Fujian, 80 bales in Wenzhou, 52 bales in Quanzhou, 40 bales in Yantai, 40 bales in Sichuan, 85 bales in Jiangxi, 25 bales in Nanyang, 35 bales in Haiphong, 6,208 bales from fellow traders, and 10 bales in Suzhou, for a total of 14,483 bales.

Raw Materials Under Control, Prices Soar

The raw materials for all textile mills, namely cotton, were originally purchased from cotton-producing areas north of the Yangtze River and in North China. Now, because the above-mentioned areas have fallen one after another, the "North China Provisional Government" and the "Central China Reformed Government" are implementing controlled transportation and sales of cotton under the orders of the Japanese side. Therefore, Chinese-owned textile mills are finding it quite difficult to obtain the necessary raw materials. Although cotton production was abundant in various places last year, it was all controlled by the Japanese side and transported to Japan and the Kwantung Leased Territory, Korea, Taiwan, and other areas, with a total value of 89,897,717 yuan in national currency. Cotton prices, such as the average price of machine-picked cotton at 52.89 yuan last November, Lingbao cotton at 84.05 yuan on average, and Tianjin American cotton at 88.11 yuan on average, all three cottons have the highest price since 1932.

Plundering Chinese-Owned Textile Mills in War Zones

Regarding Chinese-owned textile mills in occupied areas, Japanese textile industry associations such as Naigaiwata, Shanghai, Rihua, Tongxing, and Gongda have taken over the management of the various Chinese mills, calling it "cooperation," attempting to plunder them. Because the conditions were too harsh, the mills refused to cooperate unanimously. The Japanese plan failed, so they simply plundered the machinery of the various mills and moved it to other locations, treating it as their own. For example, the Chinese mills in the war zones on the outskirts of Shanghai have mostly been destroyed by gunfire. Even those that have been spared have no possibility of recovery for the time being due to the internal machinery being moved away. In total, Hengfeng, Dafeng, Zhentai, Baoxing, Shanghai, and 17 other mills, with 760,136 spindles, 91,306 thread spindles, and 24,919 looms, account for 67.7% of the original textile mills.

### Pulled Rickshaws to be Released Immediately

The case of the pulled rickshaws of the members of the Shanghai Pulled Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association being detained by the Public Concession police due to their inability to modify the wheels has deeply concerned all sectors. The Chinese directors have been requesting the association to send representatives to petition. Especially after Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu, the two Chinese directors, once visited the heads of the Transportation and Police Departments the day before yesterday to request the prior release of the detained rickshaws, a satisfactory resolution has not yet been reached. Yesterday morning, no less than a hundred detained rickshaw drivers gathered in front of the Mutual Aid Association on Guizhou Road to await news. Some even brought their wives and children, and their hunger and cold were quite pitiful. The association sent members to comfort them, and they gradually dispersed. It is now learned that Jiang and Xi, the two Chinese directors, once again visited the heads of the Transportation and Police Departments and the Deputy Director-General, Mr. He DeKui, yesterday afternoon, requesting that they have compassion for the hardships of the coolies' livelihoods and grant them accommodation by first releasing all the detained rickshaws. The Mutual Aid Association will be responsible for the military wheel modification matter, urging members to complete the modification by July 1 of this year, so that the livelihoods of the poor and the administrative policies of the Municipal Council can be taken into account. After the repeated mediation of Jiang and Xi, the two Chinese directors, it is heard that the Transportation Department has accepted the opinions of Jiang and Xi, the two Chinese directors, and the vehicles detained by each police station are expected to be released today. Starting next week, they will formally pay taxes and operate, but the Transportation Department still feels that the time is too long for the completion of wheel modification before July 1. It is hoped that the association can persuade its members to complete the modification according to the regulations of the Municipal Council as soon as possible to facilitate road administration.

### Domestic Situation in Japan Exceedingly Dire; Living Expenses See Another Increase

The "Continental Daily" reports that, according to a survey by the Japanese Cabinet Statistics Bureau, living expenses in Tokyo increased last month. The level of living for Tokyo laborers, based on July 1937, had risen to 114.0 in January of this year, an increase of 1.1% compared to last December and an increase of 8.9% compared to the same month last year. The level of living for the salaried class was 112.8 last month, an increase of 1% compared to last December and an increase of 8% compared to the same month last year. Among the five categories of goods listed, the most significant increase was in food, which increased by 2% in January compared to December, clothing increased by 0.8%, "other" increased by 0.4%, housing consumption increased by 0.2%, and electricity and heating increased by 0.2%.

### Clear Sound of Cannons Yesterday Afternoon; Guerrilla Activity Active on Both Banks of the Yangtze River; Japanese Army Helplessly Opens Fire

The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that, according to a report from the Jiaxing Road Police Station, heavy cannon fire was heard quite clearly in the northern district of Shanghai yesterday (the 2nd) from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, lasting for more than half an hour. The public believes that this was Japanese warships in the Yangtze River opening fire on the Chinese guerrillas on both banks, hence the sound of cannon fire.

### British Embassy and Others Host Banquet for Naval Officers; Army Commander to Leave for Shanghai; New Flagship Expected Today

The British warship HMS Cardock has been in Shanghai for many days. The committee of the British St. David's Society in this city held a luncheon at the Shanghai Club on the 2nd to welcome the officers of the ship as a welcome reception. However, the ship's captain, Halfhyde, did not attend due to other engagements and was represented by the deputy captain, Mr. Alif. A welcome speech was given by Mr. Bryce, a member of the society, and then they wished each other good health. HMS Cardock is a well-known and highly regarded battleship in the British fleet and commanded the German fleet in 1918. It is heard that among the British expatriates who attended the banquet was Mr. Ham from the British Embassy.

British Army Commander in Shanghai, Major General Smollen, was transferred from Britain to Shanghai during the August 13th Shanghai battle. Since Smollen's transfer to Shanghai, he has worked hard to maintain the security of the concession during this time of war. It is learned that Smollen will be leaving Shanghai soon. The Municipal Council and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps held a banquet on the evening of the 1st at the Volunteer Corps Club to bid farewell to Smollen, expressing their gratitude for his efforts in maintaining the security of the Shanghai Concession. One hundred and fifty high-ranking officials from the Municipal Council and others attended at that time, and presented Smollen with a flag to express their thanks.

The English "North China Daily News" reports that the new flagship of the British Yangtze River Fleet, HMS Scarab, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Holt, set sail from Nanjing today (the 3rd). The British warship HMS Gnat accompanied it. HMS Scarab will return here tomorrow (the 4th), but HMS Gnat is not coming to Shanghai at this time.

### Customs Prohibits Transportation of Various Native Goods; Ministry to Negotiate Purchase; Various Native Goods Businesses in Zhejiang Province Wire Requests to Transport to Shanghai; Authorities Deny Request Due to Special Circumstances of Jianghai Customs

Following the orders of the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Finance, prohibiting 54 kinds of goods such as tung oil as aiding the enemy, the cotton and native paper industries in Zhejiang Province have wired requests for release. The Customs believes that Shanghai is an area controlled by Japanese violence and does not allow native goods to be transported to Shanghai for sale. The government has allocated funds to purchase and provide relief. Detailed information is recorded below.

Various Industries Wire to Request Permission to Transport to Shanghai

The Ning-Shao District Cotton Transportation and Sales Office, etc., stated that because cotton and other goods have been prohibited from being transported to Shanghai, the livelihoods of cotton farmers and cotton merchants have been cut off, requesting that the Zhejiang Customs be ordered to release the cotton stored in Ningbo Port for transportation to Shanghai in order to save farmers and merchants. To prevent aiding the enemy, the Chinese Textile Mill Association can issue a certificate, and after transportation to Shanghai, the Shanghai offices of the Zhejiang Province Produce Adjustment Office of the Ministry of Finance Trade Commission can verify it. Moreover, the Shanghai Concession is not an area controlled by Japanese violence and cannot be designated as a prohibited area.

Zhejiang Customs Unable to Accommodate

The Tax Commissioner of Zhejiang Customs issued a statement, saying that as for whether Shanghai should be considered a prohibited location, the Customs has no authority to consider it. As for the Customs' announcement on January 23, prohibiting the export of native goods, including paper, it was transferred to the Customs by the Inspector General of Customs under the order of the Ministry of Finance and cannot be modified or disregarded without authorization. Regarding the request to transport to Shanghai for sale, it is requested that the office directly request the Ministry of Finance to review and handle it. Now, the native paper industry and others have wired to the Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs, requesting permission to transport to Shanghai.

Shanghai Temporarily Designated as a Prohibited Area

The Ministry of Economic Affairs has now conducted a detailed investigation into the prohibited areas controlled by Japanese violence, and is negotiating with relevant agencies to designate them. Before the designation by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, local authorities and customs offices in areas close to the war zones should first prohibit transportation in areas known to be controlled by Japanese violence. However, local customs offices believe that Shanghai is a fallen area. Therefore, before the Ministry of Economic Affairs designates it, all 54 kinds of native goods are prohibited from being transported to Shanghai. Currently, native goods in eastern Zhejiang and other places are being prevented from being transported to Shanghai for sale.

Government Purchases Goods Being Obstructed

After 54 kinds of native goods such as tung oil were prohibited from transportation, if they were the main products of the local area, and sales were obstructed, affecting the livelihoods of the people, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established remedial measures, ordering each province to follow them. Each provincial government should investigate the sales and production situation and report to the Ministry at any time, or directly negotiate with the Ministry of Finance Trade Commission and the Agricultural Credit Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to purchase them for relief. Now, tung oil in eastern Zhejiang is being purchased by the Central Trust of China, and tea is being purchased by the Fuhua Company of the Trade Commission.

Special Circumstances of Shanghai Customs

Since the Shanghai Jianghai Customs deposited tax revenue in Japanese banks, revised tax rates on Japanese goods, and stopped remitting funds to the Inspector General of Customs since June of last year, the national government believes that if native goods are transported to Shanghai, unscrupulous merchants seeking petty profits will want to transship them for export. The government would then be unable to stop them.

### Copper-Nickel Subsidiary Coins to Arrive in Shanghai Soon; Totaling Over 10 Million Coins; Recall Worn Corner Notes

Shanghai has recently been lacking in copper-nickel subsidiary coins for regulation. With the end of the year approaching, the need is sincere. The Bank of China telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to transport a large amount of copper-nickel subsidiary coins to Shanghai before the end of the lunar year to facilitate turnover. According to the Bank of China's news yesterday, the central government ordered the Bank of China in Hong Kong to transport some to Shanghai last month, all of which have been loaded, but the number is small and still difficult to cope with. Now, the central government is continuing to transport over 1 million yuan in copper-nickel subsidiary coins, totaling over 10 million coins. It is heard that this time, there will be fewer hard coins and more corner notes, arriving in Shanghai in about ten days. It is also heard that after these subsidiary coins arrive in Shanghai, a portion will be used to exchange the worn corner notes on the market, and the market's needs at the end of the lunar year should be met comfortably.

### Handling of Official Documents and Attachments

The Directorate General of Posts has stated that regarding the submission of official documents and attachments by various agencies, it has been previously stipulated that if official documents and attachments are sealed together, the entire amount should be charged as letters according to regulations. If official documents and attachments are sealed separately and submitted at the same time, they must be bundled together. However, official documents are charged as letters, and attachments are charged as small parcels, and are delivered together by express delivery. Since this method was implemented, many agencies have complied with it, but some have sent attachments as printed matter in order to save postage. Now, transportation is difficult in various places, and light items such as letters and postcards must be transported out first, while heavy items such as printed matter are inevitably stored, resulting in attachments and official documents often not arriving at the same time, which is inconvenient for handling official business. In order to prevent similar situations from occurring again, in the future, official documents and attachments from various agencies should be sealed separately and handled according to the above-mentioned regulations. If they are sent to places with automobile transportation, the attachments must be sent as printed matter and should also be sent as express printed matter, with additional automobile fees (domestic inter-provincial mail, 0.2 yuan per kilogram or fraction thereof; inter-provincial mail, 0.4 yuan per kilogram or fraction thereof), so that each bureau can sort them out immediately upon receipt, without mixing them with other printed matter, in order to seal and dispatch them in advance and arrive at the same time as the official documents. Special orders are given to the subordinates to pay attention to handling it. The Shanghai Postal Administration has received orders and has already instructed all branch offices to comply with it.

### The Sixth Charity Lottery: Drawing Held Yesterday Afternoon; First Prize is 39,000 Yuan

The sixth French Concession Refugee Relief Charity Lottery was drawn in public at the Yiyuan at 2:00 PM yesterday. The lottery's supervising committee members, including Shi Lüdeng, Chaisibo, Qizhi, Boluntelas, Martin, and others, as well as four or five thousand guests, men and women, from all walks of life, attended. At precisely 2:00 PM, the supervising committee members inspected the lottery balls separately and began the drawing. Before long, the major prizes were drawn one after another.

### Condition of Livestock Protection in December of Last Year; Report by the Livestock Protection Society

In December, the investigators spent most of their time inspecting livestock about to be sent to markets and slaughterhouses. Livestock resting places, such as pig pens and chicken and duck shops, were frequently visited. Since the Zhabei slaughterhouse could not be used, all meat consumed in Shanghai is now slaughtered in the concessions. Therefore, there is a great shortage of livestock resting places, and the Society had to pay attention to the condition of livestock being kept in the open, especially as winter was approaching. Sheds have been built everywhere, and it is hoped that with closer supervision, many unnecessary sufferings, such as sleeping outdoors, being tied with short leashes, and lacking food, can be avoided. During Christmas, the investigators also increased their work on dealing with cases of cruelty to poultry. They saw many carts going to the market, full of chickens in baskets. Due to negligence, the rice straw lining the bottom of the baskets had been worn out, so the chickens' heads and feet were often squeezed out of the holes in the bottom of the baskets. In the market, they often rebuked and stopped the practice of force-feeding poultry, especially geese, with bamboo poles to push grain husks and other things into their internal organs. Thanks to the cooperation of the Public Health Department and the police, several major cases of abuse were successfully prosecuted in the local court.

Due to the cold weather, the investigators also inspected the supply of straw in dog houses and other animal shelters to ensure it was sufficient. All stables were inspected, and the brands of each horse were also checked. In addition, the stable owners were advised to provide each horse with a blanket made of materials such as burlap sacks.

Several reports or complaints were received about cases of poultry and livestock suffering from skin conditions and being kept outdoors, such as leaky or strawless dog houses, monkeys kept outdoors, and monkeys, rabbits, and birds in shops suffering from various kinds of neglect. If the reports were found to be true after investigation, appropriate remedies were made. Gratitude is expressed for the cooperation of the police, as such cooperation is sometimes necessary. In one case, a dog had a severely injured foot, which was reported to the police and a veterinarian. The former said that they had no authority to remove it from its original owner, while the doctor said that the foot injury was incurable. The final compromise was to compensate the owner for the loss of money, and then the dog was able to be humanely euthanized.

Regarding occasional incidents on the streets, citizens often helped by watching over the animals while waiting for the Society's ambulance to arrive. Incidents included abandoned newborn puppies, crushed cats, and a dying cow. The latter was handled by the Municipal Council's salvage vehicle. The investigators inspected the site of the Yuyuan Road fire twice, where hundreds of refugee sheds had been burned down, and also discussed fire prevention for livestock sheds with the fire department.

### Public Concession Police Arrest Large Number of Bandits in Various Hotels - Total of 32 Male and Female Suspects Detained - Confiscated Hand Grenades, Box Cannon, etc.

Recently, bandits have been rampant in the concession, with robberies occurring frequently. In addition to organizing patrol teams and conducting strict inspections by section, the police authorities have also strictly instructed all Chinese and Western detectives in the various police stations to pay close attention. The Chinese Detective Chief of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, Tang Jian and Wu Chengmo, from 7:50 PM the night before to 4:30 AM yesterday morning, arrested a large number of male and female bandits in the British and French Concessions, totaling thirty-two suspects. They confiscated hand grenades, box cannons, pistols, etc. The details are recorded as follows:

After receiving information, Detective Tang and others, together with Chinese Detective Sergeants Wang Jinsheng, Qi Mengqing, Xie Futang, and Western Detective Chiefs Taipeng Gelingfeier, first went to Room 205 of the Ning Merchant Hotel on Tianjin Road, where they arrested Chen Siming (aka Xiao Songjiang), a bandit from Songjiang. They then went to Room 47 of the Liangxi Hotel on Hubei Road, where they arrested Wu Laowu (aka Zhixiang) from Shanghai and Chen Xiaomao from Jiangbei. They then went to Room 32 of the Jiahe Hotel on Fujian Road, where they arrested Liu Jinjin and the woman Liu Sunshi, both from Suzhou. Later, they went to Guangxi Road

Daxin Hotel Room 306, where they arrested Cai Xiaodi (local), Liu Yuanzhou (Ningbo), Zhang Zhichang (Danyang), Song Jiabao (local), Ding Fangzheng (Wuxi), Dong Fusheng (local), Fang Alin (Ningbo), Li Debao (Pudong), Luo Cao, a local woman, and Hong Meimei, a local dancer from the Shengli Dance Hall on Beijing Road (17 years old, residing at 68 Ximen Road), along with Dong Cai, a woman from Ningbo (also a Shengli dancer, named Dong Xiu×), totaling eleven people. They confiscated a Swiss-style hand grenade, forty-one pawn tickets, one ten-tael silver ingot, four Western-style suits, and two pieces of cloth. Then they went to Fuzhou Road

Zhongzheng Hotel Rooms 24 and 25, where they arrested Fan Youda (aka Xiao Changzhou) from Changzhou, Xu Hongsheng (local), Cai Chen, a woman from Ningbo, and Wu Xie, totaling four people. They also went to Room 315 of the Dahuh Hotel on Edward Road, where they arrested Dai Tianyou (Pudong), Gong Zhu, a local woman, and Ji Shicai (aka Lao Donggua) from Haimen, totaling three people. At 409 Lafayette Road, they arrested Wang Yuelong (aka A Er), Wu Fugen, Wang Wu, and Wu Ye, all from Shanghai, totaling four people. They then went to Zhejiang Road

Qinghe Hotel Room 303, where they arrested Sun Heping and Sun Hanchang, both from Pudong. His father was at Room 5 of the Rongxiang Hotel on the Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession, where they arrested Cai Yinbao from Chongming, confiscating a box cannon, eight bullets, a pistol, and six bullets. Finally, they went to 275-50 Mintini Yin Road, where they arrested Yan Guilin from Dajin and Wang Bin from Xuzhou, totaling twenty-three male bandits and

Nine female bandits. They were all taken to the police station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan described the circumstances of the crackdown, stating that due to the large number of people involved, the police had not yet had time to conduct a detailed investigation, and they were still in the process of apprehending accomplices, so he requested permission to detain them. After Judge Xiao briefly questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be remanded in custody and scheduled for another hearing in seven days.

### Suicide Due to Economic Pressure

Liu Ruomou, a guest from Ningbo residing in Room 5 of the Minle Hotel on Avenue Joffre, was 30 years old. Recently, due to economic pressure and difficulty finding work, he became disillusioned with life. Yesterday morning, he secretly drank poisonous liquid medicine in an attempt to commit suicide. The tea room attendant discovered this and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Guangdong Road Crackdown - Drug Manufacturing Operation - Manufacturing Equipment and Drugs Confiscated - Confessed to Purchasing from Caojiadu

Ye Yusha, Chief of the Anti-Drug Department of the Public Concession Police, along with Detectives Li Shugui, Liu Zhaonian, Zhao Bao, Guo Shouxin, and others, recently learned that a large-scale drug manufacturing operation producing heroin and morphine was being organized in the front building at 608 Guangdong Road, with daily operations requiring approximately 400-500 yuan. They rushed to the location the day before to conduct a search. There, they arrested Xu Derong, Xu Deyao, Yuan Haishan, and Yuan Dong, a woman from Ningbo, all from Pudong. They confiscated sixteen and a quarter taels of heroin, twelve taels of morphine essence, various equipment for manufacturing drugs, over 190 yuan in legal tender, and two suitcases with false bottoms. It was found that Xu Wang, a woman from Ningbo and the second landlord of the house, was suspected of harboring them, so she was also taken back to the police station. Under investigation, it was learned that Xu and the others purchased these drugs from Chen Yaosheng, who in turn purchased them from Gao A'gen (aka Ma Pi A'gen)'s drug manufacturing plant in Caojiadu, Huxi. The detectives went to 18 Lane 190, Tysderong Road to arrest Chen Yaosheng, but the house belonged to another person, and they were unable to apprehend Chen at that time. Later, the detectives arrested Yoon Chi-sook, a Korean woman, at 608 Guangdong Road and sent her to the Japanese Consulate for questioning. Xu and the other five were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed charges separately under Articles 5 and 9 of the Anti-Drug Regulations and Article 30 of the Criminal Law, requesting permission to postpone the hearing for a detailed investigation. After the detectives submitted a report on the investigation and search, Judge Xiao Xie-fen interrogated them and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for another hearing at a later date.

### Moore Road - Rent Increase Dispute

The landlords of Shengping Street on Moore Road in this city, citing the dense population and increased expenses, suddenly demanded rent increases from the tenants, with some increases reaching 30% of the original rent. Most of the residents there have been tenants for over ten years and have always had a harmonious relationship with the landlords. It is regrettable that such a large rent increase is being proposed at a time when the cost of living is rising sharply. After discussion, they unanimously rejected the increase. It is recently known that landlords in various neighborhoods, such as Runde Lane and Chengqing Lane, have sincerely negotiated with the tenants and restored the rent that had been temporarily increased and then reduced to the original amount, i.e., four yuan per double house and six yuan per triple house, starting from February. This spirit of mutual concession between the two parties is rare in the rent increase disputes in Shanghai. However, there are still landlords in one or two lanes who, regardless of the current environment, still insist on a large rent increase and threaten to build fences and cut off water. The tenants, feeling that they are all in the same place but divided by boundaries, are angered by this kind of oppressive measure and have resolutely rejected it.

### Attempted Murder Case - Zhu Xinliang Ordered to Eliminate Traitors - Appealed to the Second Branch Court After Being Convicted - Requested Leniency According to Law for the Sake of the Nation and the People

Zhu Xinliang (31 years old, resident of Yangjiadu, Pudong), from Zhenjiang, hid a pistol and shot Wang Yongkui, the bodyguard of the puppet Su Xiwu, at around 3 PM on December 2nd last year near the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hart Road. Because Wang was wearing an overcoat, only a hole was shot through the lapel of his coat. The Chinese police officer on duty at the location heard the gunshot and rushed to the scene, arresting Zhu and taking him and the weapon to the police station. The First Special District Court filed a public prosecution against him for attempted murder under Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The trial has already concluded, and Zhu Xinliang has been sentenced to two years and eight months of imprisonment for attempted murder as a repeat offender. The pistol, bullets, and magazine have all been confiscated. Zhu was dissatisfied with the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch Court. At 3 PM yesterday, Judge Yu opened the court for a hearing. Appellant Zhu Xinliang stated, "The First Instance Court sentenced me for attempted murder, which is really a bit heavy. To put it frankly, it's just attempted injury. Regarding my motive for hitting Wang Yongkui, I didn't want to do it myself. I was ordered by our captain to disguise myself as a vendor and secretly visit him on Hart Road for several days before taking action. But I didn't mean to kill him, just to warn him not to be a traitor. If I were determined to kill him, one shot would have hit him. Why would I hit his clothes? Moreover, the main reason I caused this case was for the country and for the entire nation. I ask the court to deal with it leniently according to law." At this point, the court instructed the defense lawyer to present their argument, and then announced the conclusion of the hearing, with the verdict scheduled for the 10th of this month.

### Old Man with a Beastly Face - Indecent Behavior - Trial Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled

Li Guisheng, a 39-year-old man from Ningbo who worked as a ticket inspector for the French Tram Company and resided at No. 10, Xinyi Lane, 257 Lujiawan Lujia Lane, had a daughter named Ronghua, who was 11 years old this year. At around 9 AM on the 29th of last month, Yang Chunsheng (46 years old), a man from Nanjing who sold soy sauce in the same kitchen shed, took advantage of the fact that Li and his wife were out and the girl was alone at home. He lured the girl into the kitchen shed where he lived, taking advantage of her youth and vulnerability, and committed indecent acts, injuring the girl's lower body with his fingers. After Li and his wife returned home and learned of this, they reported it to the French police station, who arrested Yang. The girl was sent to the hospital, where an examination confirmed the injury to her lower body. Yang was sent to the Second Special District Court for investigation and detention, and the girl was sent to the forensic doctor's office for examination on record. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liao Yuan continued the trial at the First Criminal Court. The French Concession Administration charged him with indecent assault under Article 24, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The defendant was defended by lawyer Yan Huyuanteng. The court prohibited onlookers because the case was related to morality. As a result, the court announced the conclusion of the trial and scheduled the sentencing for the 10th. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### Tao Peng Road - Bizarre Blood Case - Young Woman Sick and Lying Alone - Throat Cut

At 11:15 AM yesterday, an assassination occurred at No. 14, Tao Peng Lane, 243 Tao Peng Road, Hudong. The victim was Zhang Wang, a young woman from Pu, whose throat was cut with a kitchen knife. She was barely breathing and her life was in critical condition. According to the investigation, Zhang Wang was from Pudong,

Blood all over the bed. The neighbors ran to report to the police station and summoned an ambulance, which sent her to Hudong Hospital for treatment at 1:42 PM. The examination revealed that her throat had been cut with a kitchen knife, completely severed, making her unable to speak. Her injuries were very serious, but she was still conscious. When the detectives asked if she had committed suicide, she gestured vigorously to deny it. When asked if she had been assassinated,

She nodded in agreement, but when asked who the murderer was, she was unable to speak and could not provide any information. Therefore, whether she was murdered or committed suicide is doubtful. The police authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation. It is said that her husband went to Hudong Hospital to visit her yesterday afternoon and was very saddened, but he also did not know why his wife suffered such a tragedy.

### Jardine Matheson's New Ship "Ming Sheng" Arrives in Shanghai - Changed Berth to Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou - Maiden Voyage to Tianjin This Afternoon

Jardine Matheson's new ship "Ming Sheng" arrived in Shanghai at around 7 AM yesterday. It was originally scheduled to berth at the Roosevelt Wharf in Xinkaihe and planned to invite guests from all walks of life for a visit in the afternoon. Invitations had also been sent out. When the ship arrived yesterday morning, it temporarily berthed at Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou due to lack of space at the original wharf. As a result, there were special circumstances and many inconveniences for the invitation to visit. The company announced yesterday morning that it would be temporarily canceled and would be held when the ship returned to Shanghai from Tianjin. The ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for its maiden voyage to Tianjin and Yantai this afternoon and return to Shanghai around the 14th.

### Crime Incidents Occur Frequently in the Jessfield Area - Military Police Patrol in the Rain - Large Contingent of Police and Allied Military Armed Patrols Streets to Demonstrate Strength

The "North China Daily News" reports that a large contingent of public concession police and soldiers from the Italian Marine Corps "San Marco" stationed in Shanghai patrolled the Jessfield area in the rain yesterday (the 2nd). In recent weeks, crime incidents have occurred frequently in the area, the most serious of which was the shooting assassination on Wednesday morning (the 1st), which left two men dead and five injured. Assistant Police Chief Nuke led the patrol officers, most of whom wore steel mesh vests. The reserve police force, led by Inspector Lovell, also participated in the patrol, and Chief Superintendent Foggins led the patrol officers from the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The red police van of the reserve force also arrived on the scene, further intensifying the situation. The Italian garrison, led by their officers, wore helmets and other combat equipment, patrolling the streets. This demonstration was concentrated in the area around the Five Corners on Brennan Road, near where a fake detective was shot dead on Wednesday morning. Of the five Chinese injured at the time, one is in critical condition in the hospital. In the areas outside the concession, almost every lane has open gambling, and the frequent occurrence of crime incidents is mostly due to this.

### Thugs Break into Bathhouse - Open Fire on Bathers - One Shot Wounds Two People - Assailant Apprehended on Scene by Detective

Yesterday afternoon at approximately 2:56 PM, a young man armed with a pistol suddenly broke into the Yu Chun Chi bathhouse at the intersection of Hubei Road and Fuzhou Road and, without explanation, opened fire on a middle-aged man who had finished bathing in the official bathing area. The bullet hit the middle-aged man in the neck, piercing his flesh, and also injured the hand of Hong Yongxiang, a back scrubber in the bathhouse. Seeing that his plot had failed, the assailant attempted to fire a second shot, but the bullet was stuck in the chamber and could not be fired. At that time, Guo Shouxin, a detective from the Anti-Drug Department of the Municipal Council Police Department, was also bathing in the same room and had just finished. Witnessing this situation, he quickly drew his pistol and fired two shots at the assailant, hitting him in the abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground. Seeing that the assailant had been apprehended, Detective Guo quickly telegraphed the police station and had him taken to the police station. After a brief interrogation, it was learned that the assailant's name was Han Qingyu, 28 years old, and the victim was Pan Ziyun from Jiangbei, a stevedore. It is understood that the motive for the attack was a conflict of interest. Han was originally Pan's disciple but was unexpectedly bought off by others, wanting to kill his master. Truly, people's hearts are unpredictable. All the injured, except for the assailant who was sent to the patrol hospital, were sent to other hospitals for treatment. However, the police are still afraid that there are other hidden facts, so they are continuing to investigate.

### Refugees at Yanping Road Shelter Pay Respects to Managers - Excellent Guidance from Management Staff - Refugees Express Gratitude

The Shanghai Cili Alliance Yanping Road Experimental Shelter houses over 5,000 refugees. After the refugee shelters on Dunxin Road were built, except for over 1,000 productive refugees, the rest were relocated. The shelter should also be closed. However, over 200 people, including the remaining refugees and all the shelter's section chiefs, security guards, and cleaners, deeply appreciated the excellent guidance and service of the shelter's management staff. In order to commemorate this permanently, at 2 PM yesterday, they gathered all the refugees in the original shelter's office to pay respects to the management staff Yan Fang, Nie Haifan, Zhu Airen, Chang Daotong, Wu Yongsheng, Huang Yonghe, Zhao Buyan, Xu Gang, and Wang Pengfei. The ceremony was solemn, beginning with the lighting of firecrackers, followed by music played by the band. Representative Liu Jiangzhou stepped forward to deliver a tribute speech, followed by a speech from the entire group, which was extremely tragic, moving the listeners to tears. After the speech, the representatives presented seven silver shields, and the band played music to pay respects. The entire group cheered enthusiastically, and applause thundered.

### Forcing Signatures on IOUs with Violence - Attempting to Deny Lawyer's Fees - Male and Female Offenders Detained for Interrogation

Chen Kaifu, from Qingcheng, Jiangbei, was formerly an actor in a Jiangbei opera troupe, residing at 503 North Shanxi Road in the Public Concession and 120 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession. In late December of last year, he was arrested by the Xinzha Police Station of the Public Concession for robbery and sent to the First Special District Court for prosecution. On the 24th of the same month, his wife, Chen Zhang (25 years old, from the same hometown as Chen), hired lawyer Yu Xiufang (residing at No. 2, Liyuanfang, Kangti Road, French Concession)

to defend him. At that time, Zhang signed a retainer agreement, stipulating a fee of 400 yuan, with no cash paid upfront, to be paid later. Yu then proceeded to prepare a defense statement and defend him. On January 12th of this year, Chen Kaifu was acquitted, but the fee was still unpaid. Yu then sent a letter demanding payment. At 5 PM on the 31st of last month, Chen Zhang

borrowed her relative nephew Chen Dehong (31 years old, formerly a patrol officer in the French Police, now running the Renhe Inn at 122 Xujiahui Road) and went to Yu's law firm to pay 50 yuan, insisting that Yu sign a receipt for 400 yuan. Yu refused, only issuing a receipt for the 50 yuan paid, which led to a verbal dispute. About ten minutes after they left, Chen Zhang and Chen Dehong again

gathered a group of Shanghai thugs, numbering dozens, and rushed to Yu's law firm, blocking the front and back doors, claiming they wanted to drag Yu out and beat him up. Yu immediately hid. The group then grabbed Yu's nephew, Dong Si-yi, tearing his clothes, making a threatening scene, and forcing Dong Si-yi to write a note canceling the previously established 400 yuan retainer agreement before dispersing. Afterwards, Yu reported the incident to the French police. In the early morning of the day before yesterday, the detectives arrested Chen Zhang and Chen Dehong and

interrogated them regarding the forceful writing of the note, pending investigation. Yesterday afternoon, the French police escorted the defendants to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District. Judge Liao Yuan interrogated them. Yuan Jiahong, a lawyer from the French Concession Administration, stated that the police department had not yet completed its investigation into the defendants' extortion and intimidation case and requested a postponement for further investigation, pending the detention of the defendants. The defendants hired lawyer Li Pengcheng for their defense. After the plaintiff, Yu Xiufang, recounted the previous events, the two defendants were questioned, and they admitted to using violence to force the writing of the note. The court ordered a postponement for another hearing on the 8th of this month. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### Doctor Sold False Certificates - Fined Sixty Yuan

Since the fall of the South City, Zhabei, and other inland areas, the Japanese, in order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, announced vaccinations and smallpox inoculations. Small hospitals in the British and French Concessions of this city saw an opportunity and began selling vaccination certificates, which was discovered and reported by the authorities of both concessions. The hospital directors and doctors who sold these certificates were prosecuted and punished in court, as reported in various newspapers. Now, it has come to light that the Shanghai Hospital, established by Dr. Sheng Ouqing at 432 Avenue Edward VII, is still selling empty certificates for vaccinations that were not given, with a value of 30 cents in national currency per certificate. This was discovered by the French police, who sent a detective to the hospital to purchase a certificate. Yesterday, Xu Hongbin of the hospital was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District. The French Concession Administration prosecuted him for forgery. After Judge Qiu interrogated him, Xu Hongbin was sentenced to a fine of sixty yuan in court. If he could not pay the fine, he would be required to perform labor service, with two yuan equivalent to one day. The false certificate was confiscated.

### Public Bus - New Route 16 Established - From Yichang Road to Racecourse on MacHale Road - Route 14 Planned to Extend to Dunxin Road

The British-owned China General Omnibus Company, due to passenger congestion and insufficient existing vehicles, has ordered 47 new vehicles from the United Kingdom, 26 of which are double-decker buses, each capable of carrying 84 passengers. The remaining 21 are single-decker long buses, the same as those currently running on Route 9, each capable of carrying 66 passengers. This will greatly facilitate vehicle dispatching in the future. The company also plans to establish a new Route 16, starting from Yichang Road on Gordon Road, passing through Gordon Road, Xinzha Road, Carter Road, Avenue Edouard VII, Peak Road, Chongqing Road, and ending between Weihaiwei Road Racecourse and MacHale Road. The existing Route 14 runs from Cathay Hotel along Nanjing Road, MacHale Road, to Weihaiwei Road, Avenue Foch, and turns into Seymour Road to return. Now, this route will be extended, starting from Avenue Foch to Daduxi Road, passing the German School and Hong'en Hospital, and ending directly at Dunxin Road. It is reported that the French Concession Public Works Bureau has agreed to replant the trees on the south side of the sidewalk on Avenue Foch. As for when the ordered new vehicles will arrive, there is no definite date. However, the company has prepared everything and will rush to assemble them as soon as the vehicles arrive in Shanghai so that they can be put into operation as soon as possible.

### Reasons for the Assassination of Traitor Geng Shoubao

Regarding the case of Geng Shoubao, the puppet "Detective Squad Leader" of Huxi, who was shot and killed in the Huxi extra-territorial road construction area on the morning of the 1st, it is rumored that Geng was originally a student of Lu, but he willingly defected, hoping to be promoted and become rich. He betrayed his teacher and went to worship Lu Ying as his "boss." Initially, he obtained the position of "leader" in the puppet "Detective Squad" of the South City. Because of his good maneuvering and flattering, after Xie Kai was removed from his position as the puppet "Branch Bureau Chief" of the South City, Geng was promoted to the position of puppet "Squad Leader" of Huxi. He was too greedy, and over the course of a month or so, people in both the gambling and opium industries of Huxi hated him to the bone. Therefore, Geng's assassination may have been a vendetta. After the event, a "Youth Corps Eliminates Traitors" note was found, which was likely a smokescreen released by the murderer.

### Man Locks Himself in Hotel Room, Takes Poison and Dies: Earlier Stayed with a Woman

Zheng Changkun from Ningbo, thirty-two years old, occupation unknown, arrived at the Jiaotong Hotel at 497 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession at 4 PM on the 31st of last month with a woman surnamed Zhou (thirty years old) from the same hometown, checked into room 23, and stayed for two nights. Ms. Zhou left the hotel on the 2nd of this month. Zheng remained in the original room that night. At 12 noon on the 3rd (yesterday), a hotel attendant named Chen Rongsheng (thirty-three years old, from Changzhou) noticed that he was still asleep. He knocked on the door and called out, urging him to get up and asking if he needed anything. After repeated calls for a long time, there was no response from inside the room, and the door was bolted from the inside, making it impossible to open. Suspicions arose, so he found a way to open the door and went inside to check. He discovered that Zheng had committed suicide by swallowing poison, and was on the verge of death. An empty bottle of poisonous liquid was left on the table in front of the bed. He immediately reported it to the French police station, who sent detectives to investigate. No suicide note was found, and the reason for the suicide is unknown. It is also unclear whether the woman surnamed Zhou who came with him and left the next day was his wife or a mistress. Zheng was transported to Renji Hospital, but due to severe poisoning, he died upon arrival. The body was transferred to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for an autopsy, awaiting the Special Second Court to send personnel for inspection.

### 1939 New Ford V8 Automobile: Visitors Come in an Endless Stream

The 1939 Ford automobile series consists of three types: the Deluxe Ford with an 85-horsepower engine, the 85-horsepower Ford (formerly known as the Standard), and the 60-horsepower Ford. A brief description of each is as follows:

The Deluxe Ford V8 is most suitable for those who need a Ford V8 that is more economical in cost, more convenient to drive, and more fashionable in style, and who love luxurious vehicles. It has established a new standard of quality in the low-priced car category, with its brand-new streamlined design and modern and outstanding style. The radiator grille is quite low, and the top of the engine hood is quite deep, fully reflecting the style of this year's Lincoln Zephyr. All Ford cars are now equipped with hydraulic brakes, and the handbrake lever is a pistol-grip type installed under the left dashboard. It uses an 85-horsepower V8 engine as its power source, and its structure is stronger than the five million Ford V8 engines currently in use.

Ford V8 Automobile: The 1939 85-horsepower and 60-horsepower Ford V8 automobiles are roughly equivalent to last year's Standard Ford. Although they are practical vehicles in the Ford category, their appearance has been greatly improved. There are many people who drive cars and need economy and comfort, and these two types of vehicles are manufactured to meet this need. The car style is novel and spacious, and the interior and exterior of the car body are quite beautiful. The car body styles are roughly divided into three: two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and small sedan. This car has a new front end and a new engine hood. The headlights are embedded in the front fenders. The 85-horsepower engine of the Ford V8 is the same as the engine of the Deluxe Ford, with only one difference: the fan of the 85-horsepower engine of the Ford V8 is installed in the ordinary position of the engine, while the fan of the Deluxe Ford is directly installed on the crankshaft. The 60-horsepower engine, except for the use of new thin piston rings, remains the same and has not changed. The interior decoration of the car body is beautiful and moving, designed with the convenience and comfort of the driver and passengers in mind. The seats are quite deep, and their width is enough for three people to sit. The back seats of the sedans are also equipped with armrests. A common feature of the car bodies of various 1939 Ford automobiles is silence. This is the result of thoroughly studying the causes of car noise and its correction methods based on road conditions. The car body is forged from all steel, and all are equipped with safety glass, ventilation devices, and clear vision. The front window can be ventilated. All types of car bodies have huge luggage compartments and the characteristic of center-balanced riding. In a word, the Ford V8 automobile has beautiful lines, is equipped with safe hydraulic brakes, and the interior of the car body has various new values. It is truly the leader in the low-priced car category in 1939. It is now on display at the Meitong Automobile Company, the Ford dealer in this city. It is said that visitors come in an endless stream.

### Overview of Higher Education in Ningxia: Only Four Students Currently Studying Abroad

In the years of the Republic of China 17 and 18 (1928-1929), there were more than ten students from Ningxia Province studying at universities in Beiping (Beijing), Xi'an, and other places. All of them were self-funded. In the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), the provincial government stipulated measures for subsidies for domestic students studying outside the province, with a quota of twenty students, each subsidized with twenty yuan per month. As a result, the number of students studying outside the province increased sharply, exceeding the number of subsidies. In the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), the quota for subsidies was increased to twenty-five, and in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), it was increased to forty. The province first stipulated regulations for selecting students to study abroad in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), but it has not yet been implemented. There are currently four students from the province studying abroad. Those studying in the United States are sent at the expense of Tsinghua University, and those studying in Japan are all self-funded. According to statistics from the years 21 to 25 of the Republic of China (1932-1936), the subjects studied by students from the province include political economy, commerce, and biology, each with one student; economics, art, each with one student; political science, chemistry, and physical education, and English language, and law, each with three students; literature and middle school studies, six students; education, four students; medicine, engineering, and agriculture, each with five students. The students selected for study abroad last year were unable to enroll due to the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident). This year, they will continue to study at various universities, including three in engineering, and one each in biochemistry, medicine, physical education, education, and agriculture, and two in literature, totaling eleven students.

School Overview

### Shanghai Law College Attached Middle School: Established by Chu

Fucheng, the president of the college, in the spring of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938). When it was first established, it established a senior high school department. In the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), a junior high school was added. The school currently has two classes each in the first and second grades of the general studies department of the senior high school, two classes each in the spring and autumn semesters of the business department in the first and second grades, one class in the first grade of the business department of the junior high school, and three classes each in the first, second, and third grades of the general studies department. This semester, there are a total of 200 students.

Because the school is affiliated with the Law College, it is better equipped. The library equipment includes the complete Ten Thousand Volume Library and the Chinese photographic reprint of the Complete Collection of Books, as well as more than 10,000 reference books for each subject. Other equipment, such as calculators and typewriters used in the business department, and physical and chemical instruments and biological specimens used in the general studies department, are all available. As for the selection of teachers, Principal Chu Fengyi emphasizes both teaching and experience. The general studies teachers include Shi Shaoming, Wang Zhe'an, Qian Zhenhai, Zou Mengchan, Cao Xinhan, Yang Jueilian, Zhong Guangran, Wu Jingshan, Wang Mengshu, etc., all of whom have taught at famous provincial middle schools for more than ten years and have written extensively. In addition to Principal Chu himself teaching statistics and rapid calculation, the business teachers include Wang Xiaotong, who teaches commercial history, and Sun Huairen, who teaches economics overview and commercial knowledge, all of whom are business experts and have taught at various universities in Shanghai for many years.

The school attaches great importance to the basic subjects of Chinese, English, and mathematics. Since the last semester, the junior high school department has added two class hours of Chinese per class, and the senior high school department has added two class hours of Chinese and English each. From the first year of junior high school to the first year of senior high school, students must write Chinese diaries every day, and senior high school students must write English diaries every day. The attendance and diligence of diaries and other extracurricular exercises are carefully counted and rewarded and punished separately. This semester, in order to improve the effectiveness of learning, the Chinese, English, and mathematics courses added to each grade will break down the grade levels and be divided into classes according to the level, so that the basic subjects can reach the standard level. The intention is good, and its effectiveness is not difficult to foresee.

Spring and Autumn

### Chiang Tzu-fan Has Become a "Widow"

— Fo

The other day, a friend showed me a couplet sent to Mr. Chiang Tzu-fan of Changshu, which was very interesting. I met Mr. Chiang a few times twenty or thirty years ago, and he was indeed an interesting person. Therefore, I thought that an interesting person and interesting events would make for an interesting article. So I wrote some of Mr. Chiang's history and gave it the title "The Salted Pork Shop and the Little Traitor," which was published in this magazine to amuse readers.

Yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. Song Ping-heng, along with an article titled "Corrections to 'The Salted Pork Shop and the Little Traitor.'" This article contains a very detailed record of Mr. Chiang's life. I learned that Mr. Chiang is now seventy-two years old. My statement that he was in his sixties was indeed an error. I am deeply grateful for the clarification. Fortunately, my account was not intended to be a complete biography of Mr. Chiang. As long as it is generally accurate, a few errors and omissions are acceptable.

However, the most important point that the letter sought to correct was the matter of the chairman of the maintenance society. In fact, being a member is acceptable, and being the chairman is not necessarily unacceptable. Mr. Song's letter stated, "When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Chiang sought refuge in Tangkou. Shen Jiu-gao and others from the town organized a maintenance society and sent messengers to invite Mr. Chiang and Zhu Qing-zhi to participate. However, his son stopped him. Wang entered the city and falsely claimed to be Chiang's representative, agreeing to become a member of the maintenance society (not the chairman). Messengers came and went on the road, repeatedly forcing him to enter the city. Unable to resist, he tearfully joined the society on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh lunar month last year, serving as the director of the education department. After a month, he resigned. The petty officials surrounded him, preventing him from leaving the city. He is still in the city, living a life of melancholy."

Based on this passage from the letter, I have a few points of confusion. In short, Mr. Song's letter is simply to defend Mr. Chiang from the charge of "getting involved." But the above passage states, "Intended to go, but was stopped by his son," suggesting that Mr. Chiang indeed had a happy willingness to go. However, because of his young master's lack of understanding, he dispelled the old man's excitement. Later, it says, "Joined the society in tears." Where did these "tears" come from? It also says, "Surrounded by petty officials, preventing him from leaving the city." Now that Mr. Chiang is neither the chairman of the maintenance society nor a member, nor the director of the education department, then Mr. Chiang is completely free. What is the purpose of the petty officials surrounding him? However, I have heard that Mr. Chiang has been promoted again. Now, I don't need to get to the bottom of these things, because Mr. Song has sent a letter to correct the errors, and I have raised a few questions to ask for guidance. The letter also includes two couplets by Mr. Chiang, mocking others and himself, which are very interesting. I have recorded them below. Or, it is said that these were not written by Mr. Chiang:

"Barehanded and empty-fisted, holding up the short man's testicles, organizing a maintenance society.

Heart in throat, watching the late master's face, flattering the pacification delegation."

"If there is ambition, be firm, sighing that I am not as good as the old man of Chang Le.

Am I the only one drunk? Who knows that I am now a 'widow.'"

### A Brief Discussion on Traitors

— Ge'er

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people once conducted a "psychological analysis" of "traitors." It is said that there are four reasons for the emergence of "traitors": (1) those who do not deeply understand the pain of being a subjugated people and are greedy for money or unemployed; (2) those who hold the view that resistance is bound to fail and attempt to establish false merit in advance; (3) those who have received imperial favors and therefore wish to repay the imperial grace; (4) those who are completely ignorant and greedy for money or unemployed.

For reasons (1) and (4), we can persuade the "greedy for money and unemployed," and the enemy's brutal behavior has long proven that it is impossible to be a subjugated people. British journalist H.J. Timperley's "Japanese Military Atrocities in China: The Eyewitness Record" is the best book on the "pain of being a subjugated people." Of course, in addition to this, we must also provide relief to the unemployed. Otherwise, asking them to practice saving the country on an empty stomach is impossible. The "Bo Yi and Shu Qi" who were "ashamed to eat the millet of Zhou" probably cannot be found among the "ignorant." In fact, we definitely cannot ask them to learn from "Bo Yi and Shu Qi." The example of "Bo Yi and Shu Qi" should be remembered by the "high-ranking officials and noblemen" who are "well-fed and well-clothed."

Regarding reasons (2) and (3), these kinds of "traitors" are "incurable," and we must mercilessly whip them. If possible, it would not be excessive to "punish" them by eating their flesh and sleeping on their skin.

Those who have received imperial favors and therefore repay the imperial grace are already unspeakable. This is because they have become slaves by nature. This is the nature of all "domestic dogs." It is a disgrace to add the "title" of "human" to them. If we tolerate these kinds of "things" remaining in the world, it would be a very bad influence. If we do not eliminate them, the future of mankind is simply unimaginable!

However, what is even more poisonous are those "jacks of all trades" who consider themselves "outstanding talents who understand current affairs." Seeing the enemy's "three axe" brute force, they believe that they are bound to win and that their own side is bound to lose. Therefore, in order to establish false merit in advance, they beautify it by saying "If I don't go to hell, who will?" and boldly take up "positions" such as "committee member" or "mayor." Of course, there are also some "smart people" who hold the "three nos" principle. It seems that they do not want to establish "false merit" and appear to be serious "saviors." However, these kinds of people are even more insidious. The so-called "red-spotted pit viper in the cave" refers to these cunning and treacherous schemers. However, this is not what I am talking about.

Speaking of those who ride the wind and steer the helm, holding the "China is bound to lose" theory and taking the "mayor" of Shanghai, Fu Xiao'an, recently "developed a sense of regret." The reason is that "the time for China to use its advantages is definitely not far away." Therefore, he is extremely frustrated and believes that "in six months, he may no longer be able to stand in Shanghai." This so-called "developed a sense of regret" should not be seen as his "remorse." Rather, China's protracted resistance will only lead to the elimination of these opportunists, which is very beneficial to the establishment of a new China in the future.

The War of Resistance is truly great! Ah!

### A Wandering Soul on the Edge of the World

— Si Hua

“Algiers”

A film produced by United Artists and shown at the Grand Shanghai Theatre

After watching "Algiers," I cannot help but express my great admiration for the director's exquisite artistic skills. His grasp of the atmosphere and emotions, and his use of weaving and connecting, make the entire film a seamless whole, gripping the audience and not allowing them to take a breath. At the end of the play, the impression of emotion is branded on the audience's hearts.

First, the atmosphere is handled richly: (A) The unique music of North Africa and the special architecture of Algeria fully express the local color there. (B) The police are attacked from all sides when they enter the Casbah, which shows that the situation inside the area is complicated and it is difficult for the search team to enter it. At the same time, Mouko's escape from the police introduces the complexity of the fan structure in Mouko's scam. (C) The spy Reges is lured into the room by Mouko, sits down, and the camera pans across the doors on both sides. Mouko's partners walk out calmly, two sitting by the door and two sitting behind Reges. As a result, Reges becomes uneasy, gradually shivering, with sweat pouring down his forehead, and he becomes dizzy... Playing cards, Reges doesn't know what card to play. Mouko's partner instructs him from the side... Beaulieu returns injured, holding a gun to shoot Reges, Reges screams wildly, music rises to cover the screams, Reges dies.

Second, the interweaving is lively: (A) When the police are searching in the Casbah, Mouko and others stand still. When the police and others come out, Mouko and other partners scatter in all directions. The director uses extremely short film and a very clear and lively technique to write that guns are fired from above, below, left, and right, and from a distance, one can see the chaotic situation of the search team. (B) Before Mouko prepares to have a good time with Gaby, he is so proud that he sings while shining his shoes. The singing echoes in the space, and short scenes describe the gentlemen dancing with the singing. (C) Mouko and Gaby are sitting opposite each other. After the cut, Agnes opens the window in another room and describes the affectionate state of Mouko and Gaby opposite each other through the curtains.

Third, the lyricism is delicate: (A) Agnes' deep love for Mouko is written by the director many times as she stares at Mouko. Every time Mouko leaves the district, she jealously traps him. (B) At the first meeting between Mouko and Gaby, the director uses the camera eye to represent Mouko's eyes, focusing on the beads and bracelets on her chest and arms. In one aspect, they stare at each other silently with their eyes. This shows that Mouko has been attracted by her beauty after coveting her jewelry. (C) Mouko's two situations of not waiting for Gaby are different. The first time, he even argues with his partner. The second time, he resolutely leaves the district for the city.

Fourth, do not let go of the subtle details: (A) Wherever Mouko goes, two partners will calmly follow him out. (B) After Mouko polishing his shoes, the director has twice featured his shoes, and the audience can tell at a glance that they are Mouko's.

Fifth, the sighing ending: Mouko gets on the boat, looks into the room through the window, and Gaby sits with her back to the outside. He can't see it for a while, until he looks down. Everyone thinks he can see her, but the camera switches to behind him and three spies have already grabbed him. Handcuffed and getting off the boat, he asks for a moment to stay. When the boat starts, he sees Gaby on the top of the boat. His emotions surge and he shouts, the sound of the whistle, Gaby covers her ears, he runs wildly and shouts, the detective shoots and Mouko falls to the ground and dies. The reason why the audience feels sighing is because Mouko is like a hero in the Casbah, and secondly because Mouko and Gaby failed to meet.

In addition to the director's exquisite skills, what is worth praising is Charles Boyer's Mouko, who is calm, handsome, and has vigor. Secondly, there is Sigrid Gurie's Agnes, whose eyes are always burning with love and jealousy. Hedy Lamarr's charm and her quiet performance of love are also very good.

However, the script doesn't have much meaning. It is just a romance, a tragic love triangle. But because it is set against the background of a scam, it looks novel and cute.

### Miscellaneous Notes on Jewish Refugees

— Ke Zhen

Most of the Jews living in Germany had some money. Now, after being expelled by Hitler, they used the beautiful name of clarifying their bloodlines to confiscate their property and force them to leave the country and become homeless refugees.

They regarded Shanghai as their only new land for making a living, so batches of refugees came one after another. Their temporary dining place is in the YMCA on Szechuan Road. The author has many opportunities to meet them day and night, so I will introduce some of what I have observed to everyone.

The clothes of these refugees are very neat. Many of the materials and tailoring they wear are very particular, so at a glance, you can tell that their families used to be very well-off. According to them, many of them used to be small rich people in Germany and owned considerable assets.

Most of them are between the ages of twenty and forty, with very few elderly and young people. There are more men than women, and very few children. According to the author's personal observation, single men account for the largest number, and middle-aged men are especially numerous.

The Western food they eat every day is very simple: two slices of coarse bread (no butter), a soup, and a vegetable. This is very different from what they used to eat at home. Imagining it for them, I can't help but sigh endlessly. However, compared with the refugees in our country, they are much happier. According to them, each person's meals cost a total of four yuan in national currency, while our country's refugees only need one yuan in national currency a day. They can also be said to be high-class refugees.

When they arrived in Shanghai, their luggage was very simple, only a suitcase with them. It is said that each person is only allowed to take these things out of the country, and they are not allowed to take anything else away. They are also not allowed to carry much cash, only some for their needs along the way. Hitler's intentions can be seen in this.

When they first arrived in Shanghai, their faces were very calm, and they did not talk much, revealing how painful they were inside. The pain of not having a motherland is indeed painful!

Now, some of the refugees have found decent jobs, so compared to when they first arrived, they are finally more stable. Several younger people who have found jobs have even organized table tennis teams and basketball teams and want to compete with the teams in Shanghai. It is said that their table tennis team will compete with the YMCA junior table tennis team on February 4. The situation at that time will be very unique, and it is expected that many people will come to watch. Moreover, it is said that this competition was also arranged by themselves with the junior division, because some of those who love table tennis cannot help but feel itchy and eager to try when they see Chinese teenagers in Tongling playing table tennis.

Now, in about one or two weeks, they will all have places to live and will not have to run to the YMCA twice a day to eat.

Episode 3: Adoring the Legacy and Remembering the Old Martyr, Opening the Mind and Asking the Literate Little Teacher

I only heard the elementary school student say: "Grandpa! Let me tell you another section. After listening to this section, you will be able to understand the section above." The old man touched the child's head and said: "Good child! You explained it very clearly. There are several characters here that your grandpa doesn't recognize. Are they some kind of new characters?" The elementary school student said: "Yes! Now, we Chinese have created many new characters, but they are related to science. At school, the teacher gave me a table. I'll go back and find it for grandpa." The old man said: "Good! Then I have a white rabbit with long ears and red eyes. I know you like it, and I will give it to you too." The child jumped up happily after hearing this, hugging the old man's head and not letting go. The two Miss He were a little fascinated when they saw this, thinking: This is really a bit wonderful. Look at the two of them, one old and one young, they must be a grandfather and a grandson. Only a grandfather would teach his grandson to read, but now the grandson is teaching his grandpa. What do you say, after talking about this section, you will understand. And the old man asked the young child for advice, and said: "Your grandpa doesn't know a few characters." It's really a strange story. Just as they were wondering, Jin Danyu and Lin Jiancheng also walked over. The old man recognized Jin Danyu and greeted her: "Miss Jin, how do you have time to come here to play today?" Jin Danyu smiled: "Old Huang! Are you going to have your grandson tell you a story today?" The old man seemed a little embarrassed when he heard this, and said: "I'm making a fool of myself!" He said to his grandson, "Why don't you say hello to Miss Jin? She gave you a prize the day before yesterday." The child stood up as expected and bowed to Jin Danyu. He also told her, "Grandpa said he would give me a pair of white rabbits with long ears and red eyes tomorrow." Miss Jin said, "Your grandpa not only has rabbits, but also other fun things." Saying this, they left here. He Liyu said: "Sister Danyu, do you know this old man? I just thought it was very strange, why would an old man ask a child about words? So they are grandfather and grandson?" Jin Danyu said: "This shows how many people in our China used to be uneducated, and now it's too late to regret it. To be honest, this old man used to be a gardener in our house. His name is Ah Mao. I was young at that time, and he used to hold me to kindergarten. He is a good person, but he doesn't know a word. At first, they thought that being a gardener didn't require knowing any words. Later, they realized that people who don't know words suffer in many ways!" (30)

### On the Value of Life

— Ying Fu

Since people are born into the world, they all have the desire to live. This means: "I want to live, I want to live well in the world." Therefore, whether rich or poor, wanting to live is something that everyone desires. Even if someone is so poor that they become a beggar, they would not want to harm themselves and say, "I don't want to live anymore."

But the value of life is not truly in seeking comfort and pleasure in life. That is to say, it is not right to think: "I just need to have clothes to wear, food to eat, a house to live in, and a road to walk on." Because in addition to clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the main thing for people is to do something meaningful. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are of course necessary conditions for maintaining our daily lives, but doing something meaningful is the only main purpose of our lives. If we only care about clothing, food, housing, and transportation and disregard doing something meaningful, then how are we different from animals, wriggling and stupid, only seeking to be full? And how can society progress?

So, strictly speaking, the purpose of seeking life should be in doing something meaningful and not in mere living. The value of life lies in this. If one only seeks life and disregards doing something meaningful, then they have no contribution to society and no value in their own life. It can be said that their life is neither beneficial to the world, nor is their death harmful to the world. The so-called lice of the nation, the so-called parasites of society, are precisely these kinds of people, because they are not only useless to the world, but sometimes their existence is harmful to the world.

We can rightly say that a person with great aspirations will surely only care about how to achieve their cause and not care about how to enjoy their life. To give a few simple examples: When Wen Tianxiang was ordered to serve the king, he used all his family wealth for military expenses. When Shi Kefa was supervising the army in Huaiyang, he did not use an umbrella and did not eat rich food. Why did they not seek comfort in their lives and instead willingly suffer like this? It is precisely because they can endure hardship in their own lives, but they must do something meaningful. Only traitors like Jia Sidao, even when the country was about to fall, built lavishly, pampered their concubines, and made crickets fight; and like Ma Shiying, sold official positions to enrich themselves, while the military expenses of the various towns could be withheld. Their concept was only about the comfort of life, and they never thought about the cause for which they were responsible!

So, those who only seek comfort in life are definitely not people who accomplish great things. Only seeking comfort in life is definitely not the true purpose of life. Confucius said: "Do not seek to live by harming benevolence, but sacrifice your life to achieve benevolence." Mencius said: "Life is what I desire, and righteousness is also what I desire. If I cannot have both, I will give up life and choose righteousness." It can be seen that in addition to seeking life, people still have the necessity of achieving benevolence and choosing righteousness. The so-called achieving benevolence and choosing righteousness is what I call doing something meaningful. Those who do something meaningful can bring benefits to society and gain the true value of life for themselves.

Since the true value of life lies in this, then should we still worry about seeking personal comfort in life? Today, there is no shortage of those who sell their souls, only seeking to live in peace, and beautifying it by saying: "I want to live, so I do this." It seems that the meaning of life lies only in this, and the purpose of seeking life lies only in this. These words and deeds are truly off by a hair, but the consequences are a thousand miles off.

### Roundup

— Jin Ge

Hundreds of small fishing boats are docked in the pond, densely packed together, looking like fish scales from afar. Outside the harbor, there are also a hundred or so large fishing boats, their masts resembling a beautiful and lush bamboo forest.

The sun climbs out of the sea, stirring up surging waves that crash into the pond, causing the thousands of fishing boats to rock incessantly, startling the group of young and sturdy fishermen. They jump up in one go, rub their eyes, reel in the anchor ropes, and cheerfully sing: "...The legacy left by our ancestors, we rely on it to get through summer and winter. Yellow croaker is better than gold; ribbonfish is more precious than jade rings... We fear not the many bandits, for we are united and unafraid of their fierceness. We are brave fishermen!..." They hum like that, and then begin their work.

The large fishing boats that go first, a long line, truly resemble a long string of ribbonfish. The majestic singing fills the entire sea. In the sea breeze, it brings distant, empty echoes.

Outside the harbor, the boats disperse in all directions, each going to cast their nets and quietly fish.

The sea is extremely calm, as if it has fallen asleep.

In a corner of the sea, a small warship with a Band-Aid flag suddenly appears, heading straight towards the large fishing boats.

"Ah! The bandits are coming! Are we just going to wait for death?... No! No! Strike first, get the advantage! Little San, blow the horn, let them come to help us! Hai Gen, you prepare the cannons, quick! Quick!" The captain shouts excitedly, rushing to the earthen cannon himself, helping to load the gunpowder.

"Da de... da de da..." the horn sounds.

"Boom!" The captain personally fires the first shot. The shell flies over, hitting the bow of the Japanese ship, shaking it slightly forward.

"Boom!" The bandit ship returns fire, the shell flying not far from a fishing boat, stirring up waves several feet high.

"Rat-a-tat-tat..." the bandit ship fires its machine gun.

"Guys! Fire the guns! Hurry! What are you waiting for! Damn it! Fire the guns, fire the guns! Quick! Quick!" The captain strains his throat, shouting loudly. He snatches an earthen gun from a mate beside him, aims and fires.

"Boom... boom boom..." the bandits' cannons and earthen cannons.

"Rat-a-tat-tat..." the machine gun.

"Bang! Crack-bang!... Crack-crack-bang...!" Earthen guns.

Soon, many other large fishing boats, following the sound of the horn, sail over. Realizing the danger here, they immediately surround the bandit ship, one to the east, one to the west, like many starving fish competing for a large piece of bread.

"Boom! Boom!..." Shells fly towards the bandit ship like raindrops. Under the fierce attack, it begins to tilt.

"Ah!" A bullet hits the captain's raised arm, and crimson blood gushes from his sleeve. He can't help but cry out.

"What's wrong? Captain! You! You!" The mates gather around.

"Are you crazy? Don't worry about me! Fire the cannons! Fire the guns! Fire quickly! Quick! Quick..." The captain's eyes bulge, his teeth clenched.

"Boom! Boom boom!... Bang! Crack-bang! Crack!..."

The bandit ship cannot withstand it. The stern sinks into the water first, followed by the middle... and finally the bow. Thick white smoke rises on the water surface, gradually dissipating. Finally, the Band-Aid flag on the bandit ship's mast disappears into the water as well.

"Boom... boom boom boom!" A few final farewell salutes are fired towards the water where the bandit ship sank.

The captain raises his bloodied arm, and everyone excitedly joins in singing: "...We fear not the many bandits, for we are united and unafraid of their fierceness! We are brave fishermen!..."

The faces of the wounded are lit with the glory of honor, forgetting their pain. They have finally annihilated the invading bandits, avenging the great hatred of Meitian!

### "Comprehensive Mirror for Governing"

— Tian Yu

These past few days, I happened to be leafing through Yuwen Maozhao's "Chronicles of the Great Jin Dynasty" and saw an essay on the Great Jin ruler's installation of Zhang Bangchang, and another on the installation of Liu Yu. After reading these two essays carefully, I deeply admire the Great Jin ruler's intelligence. His tone of appeasement truly resembles that of people today; his wishful thinking is also similar to that of people today. This is truly a mirror for the present, so I borrowed the four characters "Comprehensive Mirror for Governing" as the title, and excerpted them as follows for the appreciation of the public:

(1) Essay on the Installation of Zhang Bangchang

"...Thinking of the Song Dynasty, it was truly a neighbor... Heaven was disgusted with its virtue, and the people lived in misery; and yet it only blamed others, without knowing how to examine itself... Therefore, it mobilized troops and commanded generals to punish the guilty and comfort the people... Now that the country lacks a ruler and the people should be united, but remembering its beginnings, it truly did not covet land, so it ordered the marshal's office to elect a worthy man..."

(2) Essay on the Installation of Liu Yu

"...Without annexing your territory, to show the virtue of not being greedy; only moving its ruler, to highlight the intention of punishing the guilty... We inform Liu Yu... living in a chaotic country, born in an unfortunate era. Though wise, a hundred miles are useless in the face of a lost state; though supremely virtuous, three men might be willing to serve the Zhou Dynasty... Entrusting you with territory, along with the former state of Chu. You must pacify and gather them, and find a suitable place to live. You must respect Heaven's will above, and follow the people's desires below, be loyal to the royal family, and faithfully protect the borders..."

Look at this! In the first essay, what "punishing the guilty and comforting the people," "truly not coveting land," how high-sounding they are. The second essay begins by reiterating "truly not coveting land"; the middle paragraph praises Liu Yu to the highest degree, elevating the status of a traitor, how could the traitors not be moved to tears; the final paragraph indicates the task of the Han traitors, which is to establish a new order and be slaves of the Great Jin Dynasty. These two essays are well-organized and profound in meaning. I think the Great Jin ruler can be considered the inventor of "using the Chinese to control the Chinese"!

### But in the Distance...

— Shi Guang

There is no moon in the sky, nor any stars,

But in the distance shine the eyes of warriors.

They pierce through the black heart of the enemy's conspiracy;

They strengthen the people's confidence in victory.

There is no lightning in the sky, nor any thunder,

But in the distance resounds the booming of cannons.

It turns into the death knell for the invaders;

It represents the angry roar of millions of people.

There is no rainbow in the sky, nor any sunlight,

But in the distance floats a patch of red, lined with a mass of white light.

It is our national flag, our national flag;

It will bring us the glory of victory.

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

"Because he's going to the front lines this afternoon to direct military operations, I was afraid he'd be delayed if we sat at the table for too long, so I came early with him."

The town mayor was indeed astute. Hearing Mr. Ye say this, he quickly left his seat and went to the back to order his subordinates to set up the banquet. Before long, the banquet was prepared. Everyone had to defer to one another for a while, and in the end, Mr. Ye and Commander Ye took the upper seats. The other guests also sat down in order of their status and position. Seeing that everyone was seated, Mayor Chen took a wine pot, stood up, and said:

"Today we are all here to welcome Commander Ye. The fact that our Hepu Town has produced a figure like Commander Ye is not only a glory for Mr. Ye's family, but also a glory for our entire town! I now, on behalf of the entire town, respectfully offer Commander Ye a toast, wishing Commander Ye good health and an early victory over the × bandits."

As he spoke, he came over with a smile to pour wine for Commander Ye. Who knew that Commander Ye would decline, simply cupping his hands and smiling, saying: "I can't drink." No matter how much Mayor Chen and the guests pleaded, it was no use. Mayor Chen couldn't help but put down the wine pot and say to Commander Ye:

"Then, please have half a cup."

Commander Ye couldn't resist the gesture, so he reluctantly accepted half a cup. Mayor Chen then poured wine for Mr. Ye and the other guests, settled the table, and then the conversation began. Everyone eagerly asked Commander Ye about the situation on the front lines. Commander Ye calmly drew on the table with his ivory chopsticks and said:

"The enemy landed at Jinshanwei this time with the guidance of Han traitors. Their intention is clearly to encircle the rear of Shanghai. However, this is not their entire goal. They will definitely divide their forces to strike directly at Jiaxing, attempting to occupy this important stronghold that controls the two railways of Shanghai-Hangzhou and Suzhou-Jiaxing. If Jiaxing falls to them, then they can attack Hangzhou in the south and assault the rear of Suzhou in the north."

Hearing the name "Jiaxing," the people at the table couldn't help but be shaken, because this place was not far from here, and the name was familiar to everyone. The town relied on Jiaxing for most of its daily necessities and the outlet for its agricultural products. Especially Cai Hefeng, his timber business relied entirely on the area along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Suzhou-Jiaxing railways, so he was particularly anxious, unable to help but ask urgently:

"In Commander Ye's view, is it possible for the × army to capture Jiaxing?"

"This is a military secret, I cannot disclose it." Commander Ye smiled and gestured, saying, "However, my mission is to defend the southern section of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway. I will definitely do my best to stop the enemy from coming over."

These words reassured everyone a little. Mayor Chen couldn't help but praise profusely:

"Commander Ye is not only a pillar of the country, but also a protector of our hometown..."

His words were interrupted by a plate of stir-fried dishes brought up by the cook, because several eager guests had already raised their glasses. He had no choice but to raise his glass as well, but he did not drink, quickly raising his chopsticks, making an inviting gesture, and saying to Commander Ye:

"Please have some while it's hot! This dish is made by the famous Fuxing Garden in town, and the taste is quite good."

Mr. Ye was puffing on his water pipe, and hearing Mayor Chen say this, he began to talk about the dishes with him. The other guests were still talking about the military situation with Commander Ye. Yang Yueliang asked if there would be any danger to the future of Hepu Town if the war approached. Commander Ye said,

"There are no railways or highways here, and transportation is inconvenient. It won't matter when the war first approaches, but it's hard to say what will happen later." (4)

Entertainment World

### Wu Peifu Discusses Entertainment

— Yu

It is really not appropriate to judge people too early.

For example, certain parties spread many rumors about Wu Peifu, which were published in newspapers, making him seem unfathomable. But what about now? Everything has been overturned by the facts. Wu Peifu not only did not take office as the president of any puppet government, but after resolutely refusing, he issued a statement expressing his patriotic spirit.

Wu has such high moral character and integrity, entirely due to the influence of history. He admires Yue Fei, and he praises Guan Yu even more. His major words, aspirations, and actions are entirely modeled after Guan and Yue; even in minor details, it seems that he would not speak or act unless based on what Guan and Yue said and did, as if that were not enough to comfort himself.

He once said: "Confucius's Six Arts are 'rituals,' 'music,' 'archery,' 'charioteering,' 'writing,' and 'arithmetic.' Although he advocated entertainment, his intention was to infuse education into entertainment. I am very happy to learn the Six Arts. My view on entertainment is to avoid causing chaos in one's nature, which is also what the ancients called cultivating one's character. But today's people, especially those young fellows who grow up in big cities, do they know what the Six Arts are? Their 'rituals' are ballroom dancing; hugging women and kissing; shaking hands with people and saying hello; their 'music' is 'Dance Partner's Song'; 'Sister, I Love You'; 'Peach Blossom River'; jazz in the dance hall; in short, the world has changed, and the future of the young fellows is truly frightening."

In recent years, Wu has been living in seclusion in Beiping. When he is bored, he always finds an acquaintance to play chess or Go with, quietly playing, often spending the whole afternoon. Sometimes, he raises his voice and sings a scene from "Wu Family Slope," or "Sitting in the Palace," or "Scolding Cao," but because of his age, his breathing is inevitably insufficient. When he cannot stretch out the tail notes, he complains to himself. "I'm old after all, useless." Then he bursts into a fit of laughter.

Before going to bed, he plays a game of Wu Guan, divining good and bad fortune. After getting up early, he does a set of small boxing, rests for a moment, and then enters the study. He either composes poems, paints, or studies "Spring and Autumn," so that he can assimilate himself with the words and actions of the "Spring and Autumn."

### On "Mulan Joins the Army"

— Jun Mei

On this isolated island full of strangeness, everything seems a bit abnormal, especially the entertainment industry, which is becoming increasingly monstrous, obscene, and drifting with the tide. It not only fails to talk about correct consciousness, but also betrays its own mission, always drilling into a dead end. How heartbreaking that is! Recently, South China film star Chen Yunshang was hired to come to Shanghai to film the historical drama "Mulan Joins the Army," which is currently being filmed and will be released during the Lunar New Year. We hope that the filmmakers will not focus too much on business and repeat this mistake!

The story of "Mulan Joins the Army" is very simple, but the consciousness is relatively healthy. If interspersed properly, it may not be an excellent script to inspire people's morale. In the past, Ms. Li Xiaqing, who is now famous in the aviation world, also starred in "Mulan Joins the Army," but the filmmakers, in order to maintain history too much, ignored reality, and even fell into the path of mystery and inflexibility, making the audience only feel its antique charm, and the result was a failure. Therefore, the filming of "Mulan Joins the Army" this time should at least not ignore this point.

Secondly, how tragic it is for Hua Mulan, a weak woman, to join the army on behalf of her father. Therefore, we don't have to think that Hua Mulan must be a lithe and chivalrous heroine who can gallop on the battlefield and kill enemies. It is because of the oppression of the enemy and even more inspired by righteous indignation that she had to resolutely join the army on behalf of her father, abandoning powder boxes and rouge, stopping the loom and embroidery, and unexpectedly changed her dress for armor. "She left the Yellow River in the morning and arrived at the Blackwater Head in the evening," engaging in a battlefield life of bullets and smoke. Here, we can expose the evils of war as much as possible, and it is also enough to grasp the audience's sympathy.

The final passage of Mulan's Ballad has "The male hare kicks its feet, the female hare squints, when two hares run side by side, how can you tell if I am male or female?" These sentences of description are no less than a symbol that this year's zodiac is the rabbit, making people feel that regardless of men and women, they all have a generous responsibility to join the army. Moreover, it is said that although Ms. Chen Yunshang is rich in oriental classical beauty, she cannot hide her strong posture, which is indeed valuable. We hope that Ms. Chen can not only maintain her past glory in this drama, but also hope that she will make a more glorious contribution, to sweep away the demons and refresh people's eyes and ears.

### Broadcasting Life (Part 2)

— Tang Bihua

Now that you have bought the time slot and started broadcasting, you must stipulate the time. Regardless of wind and rain, heavy snow, you must rush to the radio station to do that mechanical work, just like a singer going on stage, you can't miss the show; if you are late, the ruthless reporter will report it, "□□□ has not arrived yet, please listen to the record." Sometimes, if you have a cold, cough, or sore throat, it is simply fatal. It is like a mute eating coptis chinensis, an unspeakable bitterness. If you ask someone to substitute for you, the store you are broadcasting for will often permanently replace you, so once a broadcaster has a disease, unless he asks his own student to substitute for him, he would rather ask the radio station to play a record than ask someone to substitute for him. Some radio stations are on the fifth floor of the hotel. If you encounter an important matter and delay the time, you rush to the radio station, but it happens that the elevator breaks down, which is deadly. Breathlessly running up to the fifth floor, you can't catch your breath, and you can't speak into the microphone. The ruthless audience is there to call and question: "□□□ hasn't arrived yet?" Alas! Everything is difficult because it is difficult to eat. Once you fall into it, you complain about one line, but who told you to drill into the broadcasting circle?

The first thing in broadcasting is to have clear pronunciation and a sharp mind. The radio station has rules, and sentences related to politics and harmful to social morals are absolutely prohibited, so you must be careful everywhere. If you are not careful, you will cause problems, and the lyrics you broadcast must be constantly changed. If you always sing these old tunes, you will be said to be rehashing old news, and there is nothing new. It is much cheaper to come up with a few new patterns if you can use your brain and write, but it is miserable if you can't write, so you have to pay someone to write for you, and you can't get good stuff.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden of the Former Capital (95)

— Xu Muyun

Huang San, Liu Chunjin, and Xiu Shan were all amateurs

(Daoban) This ruthless club almost killed me (Liushui) Only beat the old hero with blood dripping. Thinking of that year, Sui Wendi Taidong conquered the west. Killed Yin Baihu to get An Ning. I hate Cao thief, who occupied ninety-nine and eighty-one counties. Greedy and not enough, he fought with Dongwu. My Dongwu civil officials want to surrender, but the military generals don't want their lives. There is a Zhou governor who leads the team to fight. Set a clever plan to kill Cai Mao and Zhang Yun. Cai Zhong. With Cai He. Came to pretend to surrender, but I saw through the situation. I, Huang Gai, used the bitter plan. A great man, meets a confidant, what is the joy of life, what is the fear of death, even if he is liver and brain coated on the ground, bones broken into pieces, it is difficult to repay Wu Hou's three generations of kindness. The soldiers helped me into the tent (Sanban) The whole body aches and I can't sit or lie down.

The above lyrics are indeed not easy to sing. I have also heard an old Henan amateur, Liu Xiaoxian, sing the Liushui Ban of "The Chain Scheme", which contains "Suddenly the ant soldiers reported a letter, he reported that the city of Beijing was covered with yellow soil and hung with red lanterns, and every household decorated with colored silk. Someone asked him why he hung the lanterns? He said that he was ordered to surround the hunting Liang Jiugong, and the Holy Emperor gave him a horse to walk the dragon, and he will sit in the Gathering Hall and explain clearly to the others." In addition, Liu sang Fan Erhuang of "Wang Jian Reconnoitering the Camp," but unfortunately I only remember one sentence of Daoban "In the army, the order is like a thunder," and I did not copy down the complete lyrics from Liu, which is a great regret. The day before yesterday, Mr. Jiang Zicheng also asked me, is it true that the painted face sings a large section of Fan Erhuang? I said that I heard it with my own ears 20 years ago, what else is fake? It can be seen that the current world of actors is too lacking in talent, and they are not willing to humbly ask for advice, so that many good tunes and lyrics have been lost, which is really too regrettable. My home still has Jin Xiushan's "Black Basin", "Assassination of King Liao", "Famen Temple", "Muhu Guan" and other records, which were all recorded by the old Moteli Company decades ago, and they are no longer available for sale outside. Whenever Jin Shaoshan comes to my house, he always asks to open it and listen to it once or twice. I said to him: Based on the friendship between the two of us, I would like to give you a few records of your father, so that you can hear your father's posthumous sounds from time to time, so that you can work hard to improve; secondly, you can also take him as a model to increase your acting skills. But my consistent purpose is to specialize in preserving the national essence. All national culture, drama, old records of the actor world, old photos, and relics of famous actors, etc., I have collected them all, and I plan to display them in the "National Theatre Exhibition Hall" in the future for the audience to listen to. Therefore, it cannot be transferred to you. However, what I especially allow you is that as long as you come, I can make an exception and open it for you to listen; because a record can be opened and listened to at most a hundred times, so I usually don't open many old records for people to listen to unless they are confidants.
