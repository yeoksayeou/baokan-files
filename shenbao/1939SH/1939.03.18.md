(Hong Kong) Xi'an Telegram: The Jin Chinese army has been counterattacking for days, and the war situation has stabilized. Most of the Japanese troops near Wanquan, Linjin, and other places in southwestern Shanxi have been cleared. Shenchi was invaded, and the Chinese army is counterattacking. Fierce fighting has continued for days between Pinglu and Pianguan, and the Chinese side has recaptured Lougou Fort, and fighting continues. Lishi is surrounded on three sides by the Chinese army, and nearby Lijiawan and Hejiaqiao have been recovered. The Japanese troops near Dawu Town have been completely eliminated. The Chinese army in northern Henan is counterattacking Jiyuan, and the Japanese troops are trying to repair the railway, but the Chinese side is sabotaging it with guerrillas, making it difficult to repair.

(Hong Kong) Yu Telegram: According to reports, the Chinese army in southwestern Shanxi has been attacking Japanese troops in recent days, and has approached Wenxi and Xiaxian. The Tongpu Railway has been repeatedly damaged by the Chinese army. Japanese troops advancing from Anze to Fenyuan in eastern Shanxi were intercepted by the Chinese army at Dayang Village Jiaokou River and have made no progress, suffering four to five hundred casualties in the past two or three days. Only three to four hundred Japanese troops invaded Jiyuan in northern Henan, and the Chinese army is attacking on three sides, making it easy to eliminate them. After the Chinese army in eastern Shandong captured Zhaoyuan, they continued to attack the Japanese troops near Qixia. Japanese troops in Guangdong plan to increase three divisions to attack the southern route. Japanese troops attacking Qianshan from Conghua have been defeated. (Seventeenth Special Telegram)

(Hong Kong) There were no major battles on the battlefields on the 16th. According to the observations of a senior military expert, considering the overall situation of the Japanese troops in various locations, they are still unable to launch a large-scale offensive in the short term. This is because the Japanese troops do not have enough troops to allocate, and they have no way to replenish them. Therefore, they have been focusing on consolidating the occupied areas. In Shayang, central Hubei, the Chinese and Japanese armies are still shelling each other across the Xiang River. The Japanese troops currently occupy the area east of the river and Jiukou, with a total of two thousand men. The Japanese troops in Yangzi, Zhongxiang, are adopting a defensive posture. The three thousand Japanese troops in Xihe are urgently trying to attack westward, and the Chinese side has taken strict precautions. Although the Japanese troops in northern Jiangxi are trying to attack Nanchang, the Chinese army has deployed heavy troops and it is extremely difficult for them to succeed. Japanese troops who landed in Duchang, Poyang Lake, have been annihilated by the Chinese army. Xiangbei is quiet. (Seventeenth Special Telegram)

Hequ: The reason for the decisive defeat of the Japanese troops invading northwestern Shanxi: 1. The Chinese army implemented a scorched earth policy, which was quite effective. 2. The Japanese troops lacked support, and all the troops numbered only three thousand, with more than a thousand killed or wounded, resulting in a disastrous defeat. The morale of the Chinese side has been boosted after this victory. (Fifteenth Telegram)

Hequ: The Chinese army recaptured Jiaokou, located four kilometers south of Lishi City, killing more than four hundred Japanese soldiers, including four Japanese officers, and countless wounded. They captured more than 70,000 rounds of ammunition, more than 100 rifles, seven light machine guns, two pistols, telephones, telescopes, gas masks, and other items. (Seventeenth Telegram)

Yicheng: Japanese troops in central Hubei have repeatedly attempted to cross the Xiang River, but all have failed. Yesterday, more than two hundred Japanese soldiers secretly crossed the river at Yuekou Xisi Port to Zhangjiachang, but were discovered by the Chinese army, and half were defeated and half were annihilated. Japanese troops in Luohansi Street transported forty canvas boats from Jiukou and forcibly requisitioned civilian boats in the surrounding area, attempting to cross the river. This morning, they were spotted by the Chinese army and shelled, hitting key areas. Japanese troops in Wujiaji, west of Jiukou, set fire to Chinese civilian houses. More than a thousand Japanese soldiers in Wamiaoji, including a small number of cavalry, were active in the Nanheji Taipingdian area yesterday.

Editorial

### Commemorating the "March 18th" Incident

Today is the 13th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre in Beijing. The Tiananmen massacre was a scene in which Japan, through the so-called ruling government of China, slaughtered revolutionary civilians in Beijing to carry out its insidious plot of "using Chinese to control Chinese." At that time, although the Chinese revolutionary movement was widespread, it failed to mobilize the vast masses of peasants and workers to participate in the subjective aspect, and the revolutionary forces were extremely fragile. In the objective aspect, the so-called ruling government had the support of Japan, and the forces to suppress the revolution were quite strong. Therefore, this revolutionary movement was finally suppressed. However, the lesson of this bloodshed has sown the seeds of resistance and national construction. Today, in order to fight for survival and freedom, they have united to resist Japanese aggression. Now that the war has entered the second stage, the Japanese army in China has fallen into a dilemma, and the domestic economy cannot bear the huge war expenses. Therefore, it is more actively carrying out its insidious plot of "using Chinese to control Chinese," extensively buying off local bullies, ruffians, and bandits, in the hope of strengthening the puppet regime and dispersing China's resistance strength, so as to achieve its aggressive goals. Under these circumstances, China has once again come to the anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, and learning from the past is of profound significance.

The Tiananmen massacre occurred against such a political background: In 1924, after the Fengzhi War, the Feng warlords, Japan's tools, took the opportunity to enter the customs and extend their influence in North China and Central China. The expansion of the Feng warlords' territory was actually the extension of Japan's power in China. In October of the following year, Zhejiang warlord Sun Chuanfang organized the Five-Province Allied Army of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi to launch an anti-Feng war. At that time, it was after the May Thirtieth Movement, and the Chinese people clearly realized that the Feng warlords were Japan's tools for suppressing the revolutionary movement. Therefore, Sun Chuanfang took advantage of the masses' anti-Feng sentiment to call for opposition to the Feng warlords' oppression of the patriotic movement. Under this call, he gained the sympathy and assistance of some of the masses. Therefore, the Allied Army not only won consecutive victories, but also influenced some of the Feng warlords to tend towards anti-Feng. Guo Songling's defection arose from this. The Feng warlords were about to collapse rapidly. Japan saw that its tools were about to lose their effectiveness, so it directly helped, eliminated Guo Songling's armed forces, and relieved him of his worries.

In the anti-Feng war, the Chinese people took advantage of this opportunity to expand the revolutionary movement day by day. On the other hand, it also influenced some advanced soldiers, causing them to turn to the ranks of the revolution. The National Army led by General Feng Yuxiang turned over at this time. Because this armed force was close to the masses and had the support of the masses, its strength also expanded day by day, and soon occupied Pingjin, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Henan, and other places.

The occupation of the revolutionary forces dealt a considerable blow to Japan's invasion of China. Therefore, it further called for the alliance of Zhi and Feng, providing the Zhi faction with huge sums and the Feng faction with arms, ammunition, and military talent, in order to eliminate the National Army. On the other hand, it also supported the Zhilu Allied Army led by Li Jinglin and Zhang Zongchang to attack the National Army in Hebei. In March 1926, the National Army repeatedly defeated the Zhilu Allied Army in Jinan, greatly boosting its prestige. The Japanese fleet bombarded Dagu Fort, colluding with the Feng fleet to attack Tianjin, in order to support Zhang and Li, and used the serious ultimatum of the diplomatic corps to exert pressure. However, the Chinese people resolutely refused to compromise, resolutely opposing the Japanese fleet's bombardment of Dagu and the alliance of Zhi and Feng. The people of Beijing specially convened a national assembly on the 18th to petition the ruling government. However, the ruling government at that time carried out Japan's instructions, opening fire on the petitioning masses, creating the Tiananmen massacre.

From these facts, in the past, Japan in China repeatedly supported reactionary forces and came forward to打击 the revolutionary forces in order to achieve its aggressive aims. Therefore, this war of resistance in China, in a historical sense, is not only settling the bloody accounts after the "September 18th" or "July 7th" Incident, but is settling the bloody accounts accumulated in history. Now that the War of Resistance has entered the second stage, the Chinese people see that the Japanese military has no way, actively using the means of killing civilians in the past to strengthen the puppet regime, intensifying its insidious plot of "using Chinese to control Chinese." To commemorate the 13th anniversary of this massacre is of greater significance. Only by advancing along the bloody path of the martyrs of "March 18th," in addition to military mobilization, can we engage in political mobilization to crush all of Japan's sinister plots and strive for independence and freedom!

### Roosevelt Urges Passage of Guam Defense Bill; Method Used May Change; Soviet Union Implements Auction of Fishing Grounds; Japanese Add Troops to Puppet State in Manchuria

(Washington) The plan to build an air base in Guam, which was previously rejected by the House of Representatives, is said to have been shelved. President Roosevelt recently spoke with Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Committee (who was originally opposed), and decided to raise it again. (Sixteenth Havas Telegram)

(Washington) Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, told people today after a White House meeting that President Roosevelt intended to resubmit the bill for $5 million in funding for the development of the harbor in Guam. It is said that the President does not oppose the deletion of the Guam defense plan from the naval and air base bill, but may suggest that it be submitted to Congress at a later date in a bill requesting funds to develop various rivers and harbors, and that the $5 million for developing the Guam harbor be included in it. (Seventeenth Reuters Telegram)

(Moscow) It has now been confirmed that the Soviet authorities have held a tender for fishing grounds in Vladivostok, and Japanese fisheries did not participate. There are a total of 293 fishing grounds, and the results of the tender for four of them have recently been announced, all of which were won by the Soviet Fisheries Company. The remaining 289 will be tendered again in two weeks. During this period, the Soviet Union and Japan may reach a compromise, and it is not impossible for Japanese fisheries to participate in the tender. Local officials recently stated that the Soviet authorities only want to take back 40 of the fishing grounds that Japan has been operating, and do not intend to take further measures. (Sixteenth Havas Telegram)

(Tokyo) A Foreign Ministry spokesman recently stated that Tokyo has received official information stating that the Soviet government unilaterally held an auction of fishing areas in Vladivostok on the 15th of this month, but has not received information about the results of the auction. Therefore, it is not known whether the Japanese fishing areas that have always been exempt from auction have now been auctioned. It is said that the Foreign Ministry is waiting for detailed information on the results of the auction before deciding on future steps. (Seventeenth Reuters Telegram)

(Moscow) It is said that the number of Japanese troops stationed in "Manchukuo" has increased, but political figures here do not attach too much importance to it. (Sixteenth Havas Telegram) According to foreign sources in this port, reliable foreign military reports indicate that new troops from Japan to "Manchukuo" and Korea have been continuously transferred to the Soviet-Manchu border within a week. The number of troops reaches as many as 40,000. The Japanese side recently suddenly ordered that all merchant ships, except for Japanese military transport vessels, are not allowed to enter Rajin Port in Korea near Zhanggufeng. The passenger transport has been completely disrupted due to frequent military transport. Separate news, four or five days ago, two Japanese divisions, about 40,000 men, landed in Kuye Bird, which is divided into two parts, half belonging to the Soviet Union and half belonging to Japan. According to foreign military experts, the Japanese troops in Korea and "Manchukuo" are usually transferred in March every year. About 40,000 to 50,000 troops originally stationed in Korea and "Manchukuo" are transferred back to the country every year. However, according to foreign reports received here, the Japanese troops originally in Korea and "Manchukuo" do not seem to be preparing to return to the country in large numbers. It can be seen that the purpose of the newly arrived troops is to strengthen the garrison strength in Korea and "Manchukuo," and at least until the Soviet-Japanese fishing dispute is resolved, the troops there will not be reduced.

### Sichuan-Xikang Inspection Team Prepares to Depart; Work Plan Drafted; No Acceptance of Any Supplies

(Chongqing) The Sichuan-Xikang Construction Inspection Team is about to depart, and reporters interviewed the team leader to inquire about everything. According to the team spokesperson, (1) the departure date of the team has been decided. All groups, except for the eastern Sichuan and northern Sichuan routes, which will depart from Chongqing to inspect the counties nearby, will all depart from Chongqing by car to Chengdu on the morning of the 18th. They will not stop along the way and will stay in the province for only two or three days. They will then depart from the province separately according to the original routes of each group to inspect the counties. (2) The work plan of the inspection team has been drafted and is very detailed. Various survey forms have also been prepared for use, in order to provide accurate materials on the various administrative situations, construction overviews, and the hardships of the people in Sichuan and Xikang provinces, so as to formulate concrete plans for the construction of Sichuan and Xikang. (3) When the team departs to various counties, it will not accept any welcoming or supplies from any party. The restrictions on the words and deeds of the inspectors themselves are also very strict. Therefore, it is hoped that all agencies, organizations, or individuals will not hold banquets to entertain them. The team has collectively decided not to attend any banquets. (4) Various departments of the central government have assigned personnel to depart with the various groups of the team to assist in the inspection. However, due to traffic restrictions, the team resolved at a meeting on the 15th of this month that it would no longer accept other participating assistant personnel from now on. (5) The team's inspection of various counties in Sichuan and Xikang is only for two months, at most no more than seventy days, and the round trip of each group is more than five thousand Chinese miles. The team is very concerned that a long journey might make the inspection inadequate, which would be contrary to the original intention. Therefore, the team sincerely hopes that people from all walks of life will allow it to hope that the gentry in all counties can provide more assistance, notify in writing or immediately provide face-to-face consultation based on what they have seen and learned, which the team members eagerly anticipate.

### From Hangzhou-Fu to Southern Anhui, a Frontline Inspection Report: The Japanese Army Employs Bluffing as a Cautious Tactic; Chinese Forces Will Inflict a Fatal Blow

(Hong Kong) Over the past ten days, our reporter has traveled from the Hangzhou-Fu frontline to the southern Anhui frontline, compiling the following report based on integrated information from both the Japanese and Chinese sides: A. The Japanese army between Hangzhou and Fu maintains a force of approximately 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers, with minimal fluctuations. The Japanese have claimed to be constructing permanent fortifications along the lakes and hills between Wukang, Yuhang, and Fuyang. However, there has been no activity for over a month. From a distance, the reporter observed very few sentries at the Fuyang Japanese fortresses, and the situation remains unchanged, suggesting a mere bluff. There is more activity of the Japanese army between Jiaxing and Haining, reportedly a mixed brigade, intending to eliminate the Chinese guerrillas along the coast. There have been repeated encounters in recent days. B. Along the west bank of Tai Lake and the river to Wuhu, the two divisions of the Japanese army have concentrated their main forces in the suburbs of Shanghai and Wuhu-Wanzhi area. In case of emergency, they will utilize railways and highways to quickly transport troops. According to confirmed reports, the Japanese forces at various strongholds around Tai Lake range from two to three hundred to as few as forty or fifty soldiers. Besides day and night patrols, there are no aggressive actions. The large basin shaped like a bow, extending from the northwest of Tai Lake to the Yangtze River, is one of the weakest links in the Japanese defenses. Judging from the recent panicky situation within the puppet organizations, the Japanese are feeling increasingly challenged in their defense. C. In northern Jiangsu, a Japanese force of one and a half divisions is applying heavy pressure, advancing southward along the Longhai Railway in three routes, urgently seeking to break through the Huai River line to facilitate rapid transportation. Currently, the Chinese forces, after retreating eastward from Hanshui and Huaiyin, have reorganized into smaller units for comprehensive mobile surprise attacks. The area around Funing, Yancheng, and Dongtai will become the new focus of the war in northern Jiangsu. However, the Japanese offensive has weakened recently. D. Across the river from Anqing at D渡口 (D渡口), the Japanese army has slightly increased its presence. Japanese gunboats have been patrolling the river surface between 大流 (Daliu) and 香口 (Xiangkou) rigorously. On the dawn of the 3rd of this month, around three hundred Japanese and puppet troops attacked the second district of Dongliu. After being intercepted and defeated by the Chinese self-defense forces, the area has calmed down. Wangjiang city on the north bank of the Yangtze River, since its recapture on the 6th, has not been challenged by the Japanese army. There are no traces of the Japanese army in Shou County and Fengtai, and the local order has slightly stabilized. The Japanese claim to treat the eastern battlefield as an economic and political war zone. The Japanese and puppet newspapers repeatedly spread false peace rhetoric. Their intention is clearly to deceive the Chinese people with false peace, relaxing the Chinese side's will to fight. They are also infatuated with the abundant resources of the Tai Lake basin, striving to avoid direct battles to facilitate their predatory schemes. The Chinese side has initiated comprehensive countermeasures to inflict a fatal blow to the Japanese army. (16th dispatch)

### Central Daily News Commentary: Austria and Czechoslovakia Were Conquered Due to a Policy of Non-Resistance

(Chongqing) The Central Daily News editorial stated that the conquest of Austria and Czechoslovakia was the result of adopting a policy of non-resistance. Overseas events have proven that the Chinese government's determination to resist Japanese aggression with arms is the correct policy. Although Abyssinia is weak, it is still fighting. Austria and Czechoslovakia, however, did not offer any resistance, and within a day, they ceased to be independent nations. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

### Former Commander of the Sixteenth Army, Fan Shisheng, Assassinated: Suffered Sniper Attack While Practicing Medicine in Yunnan; Perpetrators, Two Brothers, Arrested; Motive for Assassination Possibly a Vendetta

(Kunming) Fan Shisheng, former commander of the Sixteenth Army, returned to Yunnan last year and resided at No. 1 Pu Cao Tian (蒲草田). He hung up his shingle and practiced medicine. At 4:30 PM on the 17th, while riding a rickshaw to the front of the First Health Experiment Institute at the foot of the South City Wall, he was suddenly attacked by two assassins with handguns. Fan was hit by several bullets and immediately fell to the ground, dying on the spot. The rickshaw puller was also seriously injured. The assailants were arrested and identified as brothers Yang Weixiang (楊維襄) and Yang Weiqian (楊維騫). It is rumored that their father, Yang Zhen (楊蓁), was once Fan's chief of staff and was shot by Fan's troops. This assassination may have been motivated by revenge. (Dispatch on the 17th)

### Financial Conference Concludes: President Kong Delivers Closing Remarks

(Chongqing) President Kong's closing remarks at the local financial conference on the 15th were as follows: "The Ministry of Finance convened this local financial conference. During the short five-day session, everyone was able to concentrate, report in detail, and discuss with precision. Moreover, during the review and discussion, you were all able to contribute your insights gained from experience and knowledge, as well as strategies for the benefit of the nation and society. This is of great significance. Today, the Supreme Leader instructed us that during the war of resistance, there are three essential tasks: first, military affairs; second, education; and third, the economy. The economy is closely related to finance, and finance is the mother of all undertakings. Without finance, everything is empty talk and impossible to realize. Therefore, to maintain the source of finance, we must develop the economy, and consolidating finance and seeking its development are of utmost importance. You are all from various regions, either in charge of local finance or managing local financial institutions. Your responsibilities are very significant. In this extraordinary period, being able to gather together and jointly discuss various major plans to contribute to the nation, so as to achieve the goal of winning the war of resistance and building the nation, is a rare opportunity. Throughout one's life, regardless of its length, one always hopes to fulfill one's responsibilities to the nation and make some contributions to society. The legacy of ancient sages and worthies, the so-called establishing virtue, establishing merit, and establishing words, carries the same meaning. Now, under the current situation of all-out resistance to seek survival and independence, people across the country are united in their efforts to save the nation. Looking back at our nation's history, whenever there has been foreign aggression, there have been examples of unity in resisting the enemy. However, never has there been such a gathering of national strength, united and resolute in confronting the enemy. We believe that after this war of resistance, we have shattered the enemy's dream of unifying East Asia, giving the enemy a profound lesson. From now on, the enemy will no longer dare to underestimate us. Our awakening this time is just like gold being refined in high heat, removing the impurities. From then on, we will break away from the status of a colony and forever become a first-class nation in the world. Our financial conference is convened during this epoch-making period, and its significance is self-evident. If we want to contribute to the nation and society, and establish a lasting reputation, now is a rare and valuable opportunity. There will probably never be such a great opportunity again. Recently, many people have criticized the government's meeting habits, saying that they 'meet but don't discuss, discuss but don't decide, decide but don't act, and act without strength.' This is probably because in general meetings, participants like to make proposals, and there are too many proposals to discuss in a short time. So, they have no choice but to send them to the government for review. Our conference may not have many proposals, but they are greatly related to the war of resistance, nation-building, and the revitalization of the nation. This can be said to be a historical conference, and its important nature is different from ordinary meetings. After detailed research and discussion, we have decided on a very good plan, which must be implemented one by one and never shelved. I hope that everyone understands the greatness of their responsibilities and missions. After returning to your local areas, follow the plan and put it into practice, correcting the past problems. This morning, the Supreme Leader instructed that finance has made great contributions to the country through various measures in the past. Our military strength is indeed inferior to others, but our financial system and economic organization are what the enemy fears. Although the enemy has tried every means to undermine our finance and destroy our economy, they have wasted their efforts and achieved nothing. Now, our legal currency (fapi) credit, even after a long period of war, is still very solid. Even internationally, it has gained extraordinary status and reputation. The report of the HSBC shareholders' meeting and the speech of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon have all praised the credibility of our legal currency. Not only is this the attitude of a third party, but even the scholars and experts on the enemy's side have to admit this fact in their treatises. From this, we can see that China's currency system and finance have gained a considerable position internationally. However, the acquisition of this achievement and reputation is by no means due to luck or accident, but the result of the hard work and efforts of many people in the past. This precious achievement is of great benefit to the war of resistance, nation-building, and the revitalization of the nation. We must not only maintain this situation, but also promote and expand it. Therefore, we still need to make painstaking efforts and continue to work hard in the future. Since this conference has a detailed plan, we must promote it step by step. In addition, we must unite and cooperate, and there must be an overall plan and an overall organization. We must not act independently and without principles. I have attended the education conference and told the participants that education is the mother of the nation. Our education in the future should cultivate talents who meet the following four conditions: (1) have a noble personality; (2) have a sound physique; (3) have applicable skills; and (4) have a spirit of cooperation. This is not only what education should do, but also what you should do in training talents in the future. In the past, on the one hand, the talents who graduated from schools felt that they had nothing to do, and on the other hand, the society felt that there were no talents available. The graduates of schools did not meet the needs of the society, and the society could not accommodate these talents. This is the shortcoming of education in the past. In the future, the financial sector should reward, cultivate, and promote talents who have the above four conditions. This is also a very important task for the financial sector in the future. Recently, transportation is not very convenient, and you all have your own tasks and cannot stay here for a long time. Therefore, this conference will end today. I hope that everyone can follow the plan of this conference, unite sincerely, implement it in all aspects, and select and explore talents who can help themselves and provide them with appropriate training. Helping oneself is helping the country. What I have said today is not without value for your reference. I hope you will make extra efforts and hope that this war can defeat the enemy and end soon. Under the Three Principles of the People, we will build China, not only to revitalize the Chinese nation, but also to achieve the supreme goal of the world being for all. (16th dispatch)"

The Czech Jing (京) Daily declared that Germany's ambition to expand its territory is still not satisfied. According to eyewitnesses, members of the Sturmabteilung (SA) went to the Czech National Bank this afternoon and transported away sixteen cars of gold reserves.

### British and French Public Opinion Turns Increasingly Hardline Against Germany: Condemning Hitler as Despicable and Shameful, Advocating Strengthening Capabilities

(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that after the Czech incident, British public opinion has gradually hardened. This trend can be seen in the sudden changes in the tone of The Times and the Daily Mail. Among British newspapers, these two newspapers have always advocated a rational solution to Germany. However, The Times now condemns the activities of the German secret police in the Czech capital as appalling and contrary to the behavior of civilized countries. The Daily Mail also stated, "Hitler's attitude towards the world is despicable and shameful." "Our security depends on our military strength." (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

(Paris) Newspaper commentary here has gradually become more hardline and direct. Le Journal de Paris expresses deep disgust at Germany's tyranny, calling the Germans a people of lies and plunder, regarding any oath as nothing. France has no other way than to prepare with threats. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

(London) The London Times, in a commentary titled "Military Action," stated, "Hitler's annexation of Bohemia and Moravia is nothing less than a blatant announcement to the world that Germany's future policies will not be guaranteed by morality in any way. The destruction of Bohemia and Moravia has no defense or plausible excuse to hide behind. On the contrary, the German leader himself has gone further and completely violated his promises. Since the National Socialist Party came to power, German policy has gradually become public, and the general public can better understand its content. In short, there is no room for moral debate on this brutal act of oppression. However, the German government does not conceal it, and its propaganda department continues to use its traditional tactics, making all kinds of base and general lies. Who believes that the efforts and military gains of this week can survive by luck? Except for the National Socialist Party, Germans, we believe, are questioning whether violating the firm lessons of history can make Germany more solid. Finally, we believe that time will always determine everything. Whether this week is a bright start for the new Czech leaders, we will wait and see." (Associated Press dispatch on the 17th)

(London) Today, the government has gradually become indignant at Hitler's recent actions, because the British government has repeatedly expressed trust in Hitler's guarantees, but now Hitler has gone back on his word. 克明斯 (Kemins) declared in the "News Chronicle" that Chamberlain's optimistic tone last weekend was not consulted with the Foreign Office, so the Foreign Office was very panicked about what he said. At that time, the government was sleeping sweetly, but now it must quickly rebuild a hardline foreign policy on the ruins of the appeasement policy to avoid the expulsion of Chamberlain. (Associated Press dispatch on the 17th)

### Hitler's Whereabouts

Brno, Moravia Province: Leader Hitler arrived here at 11:10 AM, welcomed by the Governor of Austria Province, Ingard, and the leader of the National Socialist Party branch in the province, 布格尔 (Buger). The leader will probably return to Vienna tonight. As for whether he will take the opportunity to go to Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia Province, nothing has been heard. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)

(Berlin) It is rumored that Hitler had a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for a quarter of an hour before leaving Prague last night. Although Hitler has gone to Brno, no one knows where he will stay tonight. It is expected that Hitler will rush to 下尔诺 (Xia Ernuo) so that he can inspect the troops there today. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

### Slovakia Has Become a German Protectorate: Poland Is Panicked and Uneasy, Surrounded by Germany on Two Sides

Warsaw: The news that Hitler has placed Slovakia under his protection has caused panic here, because Poland hoped that Slovakia, which Poland recognized yesterday, would be independent, at least politically, even if not economically. Poland is now surrounded by Germany on two sides. Now that Slovakia has entered the German customs area, Poland's only direct non-German trade route to the Danube River basin has also been blocked. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

Bratislava: After Slovak Prime Minister 蒂梭 (Tiso) requested protection from Germany, Leader Hitler granted his request, and German troops began to occupy various border areas of Slovakia. The government office in 马拉基 (Malaki) had a dispute with the German military authorities, which was quickly resolved. Similar incidents have occurred in other places, but they are not of major nature. The head of the Slovak propaganda department recently gave a speech to the press, stating that German troops are occupying the borders of the country based on the following four reasons: (1) The border line between Moravia Province and Slovakia Province, which was drawn in 1921, is only temporary. (2) Hungarian terrorists are threatening the security of the country. (3) The Czech troops in Carpathian Ruthenia Province and the Ukrainian military groups have a tense relationship, which may endanger the country. (4) The internal situation of the country has not yet reached stability. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

Prague: German troops have now arrived at the border of the independent state of Slovakia and may go to Bratislava, the capital of the state, at any time. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

### Alas! Ha加达 (Hajada)'s Words: Voluntarily Destroying the Country: Violent Oppression

Prague: President Ha加达 (Hajada) announced a book to the Czech people over radio last night, saying: "The worries I had 20 years ago have unfortunately come true. The solution for the nation that my colleagues thought of in the past has only become a page in our national history. This has been proven after experiencing many changes. As for the cause of the changes, who should be responsible for it and who should share the blame, there is no need to state it now. Leave it to future generations to judge fairly. The urgent task is to maintain a bright and calm attitude, accept the current changes, and realize that we must have a serious responsibility, that is, do our best to hand over this precious heritage to future generations. After the change occurred, I maintained until the last moment, and with the consent of the government ministers, I personally visited German leader Hitler, and with the courtesy of the leader, I discussed the situation thoroughly with Hitler for a long time and decided to announce that the Czech nation and its national destiny would be entrusted to Hitler, and gave him complete trust. Hitler also promised to protect the existence of our people and promised that our people would enjoy autonomy. Now he has fulfilled his promise and issued an order to place Bohemia and Moravia under German protection. From now on, the survival of our people will be guaranteed, and our lives will also be developed in accordance with the unique national character... Thanks to the power of Hitler, Germany has now become the largest country determining the fate of Central Europe. Our nation is now united with that country, thus restoring the relationship with the Holy Roman Empire. Hitler also told me that if the Czech people need German assistance in their lives, Germany will not hesitate to help. Now we must not fail the expectations of the leader of the great German nation. Although the leader trusts our people very much, I will do my best to protect the interests of our people, and if necessary, I will not hesitate to adopt the most severe methods to deal with it. I hope that our people can enjoy a peaceful and prosperous life under the new legal status and have great development." (Havas dispatch on the 17th)

### Ukrainian Prime Minister Requests Hungary to Allow Autonomy; Hungarian Troops Have Reached the Polish Border, but Fierce Fighting Continues Elsewhere

From Sighet, Romania: Carpatho-Ukrainian Minister of Health, Dr. Dulimei, and Minister of Transportation, Mr. Balaska, have departed for Budapest as special envoys of Prime Minister Father Volosin, appealing to Hungary to grant autonomy to Ukrainians within Hungary. Father Volosin has telegraphed Berlin, requesting Hitler to intercede with Hungary to achieve this goal. Father Volosin made this decision after attempting to seek assistance from the Romanian army. (Reuters, 17th)

From Budapest, Hungary: Hungary has formally notified the four powers—Italy, Germany, Poland, and Romania—of its actions in occupying the Carpatho-Ukrainian province. (Reuters, 17th)

From Bucharest, Romania: Carpatho-Ukrainian Prime Minister Volosin, after seeking refuge in Romania, has proposed to the Romanian government that it take over the province. The Romanian cabinet held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the matter. It is reported that the cabinet members are unwilling to accept this proposal because the province has already been completely occupied by Hungarian troops. (Havas, 16th)

From Warsaw: After Hungarian troops entered the Carpatho-Ukrainian province, their advance units, led by Colonel Bleid, reached the Polish border at 3:30 PM today, at the Dukla Pass. They met the Polish border guards led by Colonel Spychalski. The two military commanders then held a friendly gathering in the town of Khemique, with a very warm atmosphere. The Polish people were overjoyed to learn that Poland and Hungary now shared a border. When Speaker of the Senate, Mr. Medhingski, officially announced this news in the Senate this afternoon, all the senators stood up and cheered, "Long live Hungary!" At 8:00 PM in the evening, over two thousand people held a gathering near the Hungarian embassy to celebrate. The Hungarian ambassador appeared on the balcony and gave a speech, saying, "Now that Poland and Hungary share a border, the relations between the two countries will surely become stronger." He concluded by shouting, "Long live Poland!" The crowd responded with "Long live Hungary!" They then marched through the streets, singing patriotic songs. In addition, news from the border reports that Czech refugees are continuously fleeing into Poland. Some Czech soldiers have also fled to the border, where Polish border guards immediately disarmed them. (Havas, 16th)

(Berlin) According to sources from the Ukrainian side, after Hungarian troops entered the Carpatho-Ukrainian province, they occupied the cities of Shuster and Bilki, effectively dividing the province into two. However, Ukrainian troops are blocking the Hungarian army in the city of Iza Sava. Fierce fighting is also reported in the western city of Berezine. (Havas, 17th)

### Hitler's Signed Agreements Are Not Worth the Paper They Are Written On, Says Former British First Lord of the Admiralty

(London) During today's House of Commons debate on the naval budget, former First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Duff Cooper, stated that the value of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and any agreements signed with Germany, is highly questionable. He stated that the head of Germany is a habitual oath-breaker and traitor, and therefore, any agreement signed by the German leader is not worth the paper it is written on. (Reuters, 16th)

### Memel and Danzig

(Berlin) It is learned that the Memel Autonomous Region Parliament is scheduled to meet at 10:00 AM tomorrow to discuss the situation after Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. (Havas, 17th)

From Kaunas, Lithuania: It is rumored that the leader of the German ethnic group in the Memel Autonomous Region, Mr. Neumann, has submitted a note to the Lithuanian government, demanding independence for the autonomous region. However, it is unknown whether this is in the form of an ultimatum. Responsible officials here have neither confirmed nor denied this rumor. Foreign Minister Urbsys, who recently attended the coronation ceremony of Pope Pius XII in Rome, has started his journey back home and will briefly stop in Berlin tomorrow. (Havas, 16th)

From Kaunas, Lithuania: It is rumored that the leader of the German ethnic group in the Memel Autonomous Region, Mr. Neumann, has submitted an ultimatum to the Lithuanian government, demanding annexation by Germany. The semi-official Lithuanian news agency, ELTA, has issued a message denying this. (Havas, 17th)

(Berlin) A spokesman for the Lithuanian Embassy in Germany informed a reporter from the Reuter News Agency that Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbsys will return home via Berlin the day after tomorrow. The report by the French news agency yesterday that the Lithuanian Foreign Minister is already in Berlin to discuss the Memel issue with German officials is unfounded. However, after the Foreign Minister arrives here the day after tomorrow, he will naturally visit the German Foreign Ministry. (17th)

From Warsaw: The High Commissioner of the League of Nations for the Free City of Danzig, Mr. Burckhardt, has departed for Geneva.

### British Parliament Discusses Naval Budget: 200 Ships to Be Built This Year; Existing Fleet Can Challenge Any Combined Fleet; Tactics for Detecting and Sinking Submarines Also Superior to Other Countries

(London) The Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, Mr. Shakespeare, presented the naval budget to the House of Commons today, totaling £149,000,000, exceeding last year's record peacetime budget by £23,000,000. Mr. Shakespeare stated that no less than £61,000,000 of this total will be used for ships planned in 1939 and previous years, and for repair work on existing fleets. During the current fiscal year, the navy added 43 new warships, and another 60 warships will be added to the fleet in 1939. Members will surely feel the magnitude of the 1939 shipbuilding program, which includes: (1) Two high-speed battleships, each 40,000 tons, with 16-inch guns; (2) Four cruisers for protecting commerce; (3) One giant aircraft carrier; (4) Two destroyer flotillas; (5) Twenty new-style high-speed escort ships, each equipped with weapons to resist submarines and aircraft. Shipyards across the country will be engaged in building 200 warships this year, totaling 870,000 tons. This is a national plan for defense efforts, unprecedented in peacetime, exceeding the tonnage completed annually in the years before the last Great War by 30%. 220,000 tons will be completed within one year, compared to an average of 170,000 tons in the years 1912-1914. If we compare the construction work of one ton in the past with one ton today, battleships are three times larger and destroyers are six and a half times larger than before, because the design is more complex, the protection is more comprehensive, and the gun positions are more important. As an example, the cost of managing the gears of the battleship HMS George V, launched in 1912, was £11,000, while the cost of the gears of the recently launched battleship with the same name has increased to £213,000. The increase in construction work is not limited to shipbuilding. In the past three years, the construction work of heavy artillery has increased twentyfold, medium artillery fivefold, and light artillery eightfold. As for mines, torpedoes, depth charges, shells, and fuses, there are now sufficient supplies for at least one year of war. When Mr. Shakespeare spoke of the program to resist submarines and aircraft, members paid close attention. Mr. Shakespeare said that the danger of submarines is often exaggerated, forgetting that a total of 16,500 ships were sunk by enemy submarines in the last Great War, of which only 102 were sunk while being escorted by warships. After the escort method was adopted in 1917, the harm of submarines was greatly reduced. As a result of close cooperation between the Admiralty and shipbuilding industry leaders over the past two years, it can now be stated that Britain will be able to implement an escort organization on any route it deems necessary immediately after the outbreak of war. Sufficient anti-submarine guns have been stored to meet all expected needs. More than 9,000 merchant seamen have now learned transportation protection methods and gunnery. Appropriate weapons and equipment, available for the majority of merchant ships, have been stocked so that they can be distributed to each ship to resist submarines once war breaks out. Since the last Great War, science has made great progress in resisting submarine warfare. He certainly cannot announce the nature and extent of this progress, but he believes that Britain's methods of detecting, searching, and sinking submarines are superior to any country in the world. He had participated in the experiment of searching for the location of submarines, and the results were very good. Experts say that in suitable environments, the location of submarines can be detected with no doubt in nine out of ten cases, which is very credible. Mr. Shakespeare also mentioned the success of the "Niehong" patrol method in the Mediterranean, saying that this is clear proof that those driving submarines dare not ignore the British ships that can sink submarines in a certain area. Mr. Shakespeare also spoke of air raids, saying that the policy of the Admiralty is to install the latest anti-aircraft guns on warships, and the number of these anti-aircraft guns has now increased by 75%. The difficulty of air raids on warships with anti-aircraft guns and attacks on undefended merchant ships cannot be compared. This can be seen from recent events at sea in Spain. Moreover, in addition to anti-aircraft guns, there are also naval aircraft and the cooperation of the Imperial Air Force. Regarding the escort of armed self-defense merchant ships, when they enter narrow seas and approach the coast of their own country, the Imperial Air Force will provide very close cooperation. In general, the Admiralty is confident that the British Navy today is very strong and can accept the challenge of any combined enemy fleet. Mr. Shakespeare also spoke of the procedures for transferring naval aircraft from the command of the Imperial Air Force to the Navy and the recruitment of naval soldiers, saying that the recruitment results last year were very good. Since 1938, about 18,000 officers and soldiers have joined the Navy, selected from 70,000 applicants. The six new aircraft carriers will not be able to join the fleet until 1940. The required aircraft have already been ordered and are actively being constructed. The number of naval air force personnel has increased from 3,000 in 1938 to 6,000, and is expected to increase to 10,000 in 1942. (Reuters, 16th)

### Britain Being Forced Out of the Yangtze River: Statement from the Admiralty

(London) During today's House of Commons debate on the naval budget, the Admiralty spokesman, Mr. Lewellyn, concluded the debate by stating the naval position in the Far East, saying, "It is not true that Britain has been driven out of the Yangtze River. We are all aware of the various difficulties there, but of the fourteen gunboats permanently stationed on the Yangtze River, six have already returned to Shanghai, and eight are still stationed upstream. This situation is quite normal, as a certain number of gunboats are always stationed in Shanghai for repairs, etc." Regarding the reopening of the Yangtze River, Mr. Lewellyn replied that this matter belongs to diplomacy, but Britain still has gunboats stationed on the Yangtze River. (Reuters, 16th)

### French Cabinet Passes Bill to Strengthen National Power: Large-Scale Preparations to Be Made; Submitted to Parliament for Discussion Today

(Paris) After the State Council meeting held by the Cabinet at 10:00 AM today, a communiqué was issued stating, "Premier Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet presented reports on the international situation separately, and read out the draft statement that the government intends to issue to Parliament, which was passed by the meeting. Premier Daladier then submitted a bill, advocating that the government be given the necessary powers to consolidate and strengthen France's power. This bill was also unanimously passed by the State Council and will be submitted to the National Assembly for discussion tomorrow." (Havas, 17th)

(Paris) Well-informed sources have announced that Premier Daladier is scheduled to submit a bill on political, economic, and military powers to the State Council tomorrow, and then submit it to the National Assembly for discussion on the 18th. The main points are as follows: (1) The government may mobilize various industries related to national defense and maximize their production efficiency. The current 40-hour work week may also be changed. (2) When necessary, the government may requisition national defense-related factories and their workers as much as possible. (3) The implementation methods of the mobilization system may be revised to give it greater flexibility. (4) The term of the National Assembly (scheduled to expire in May 1940) may be extended by two years to avoid holding elections in the midst of unstable international conditions. (Havas, 16th)

### Bulgarian Prime Minister Visits Turkish President: To Join the Balkan Entente?

Istanbul: Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov arrived here today and will proceed to Ankara to meet with Turkish President Inonu.

(Reuters, 16th)

### Switzerland Anxious

From Bern, Switzerland: After Germany's changes in Central Europe, Switzerland is quite uneasy. All newspapers commented with anxious tones, criticizing Germany for disregarding the right of small countries to self-determination and for not keeping its promises. One newspaper stated that the most serious blow suffered by Switzerland was the shakeup of the trust that promises should have. (Reuters, 16th)

From Basel: Swiss Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Rubrecht, delivered a speech, stating: "Any country that attacks our country and endangers our independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity may provoke war. Switzerland will never succumb to other countries. We hope the world will recognize this." (Havas, 17th)

### Italy Increases Troops in North Africa Again: Is It Planning to Take Advantage of the Situation? Britain Asks for an Explanation

(London) In the wake of the dramatic changes in Central Europe, Italy has again increased the number of troops stationed in its North African colony of Libya. Regarding this matter, the British Ambassador to Italy, Lord Perth, has been instructed to express his regret to Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Parliamentary sources here have stated that the number of troops stationed on the Italian island of Rhodes in the Mediterranean has also recently increased. The Italian side has not notified Britain in advance in accordance with the Anglo-Italian agreement, which the government is quite anxious about. In addition, Italy may take action against Albania, and the Croat ethnic group in Yugoslavia is also showing signs of unrest, due to German incitement. (Havas, 17th)

(London) The Counselor of the British Embassy in Italy, Mr. Charles, visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday, and again requested an explanation regarding the Italian government's repeated decisions to increase troops in its North African territory of Libya. (Havas, 17th)

(Rome) Authoritative sources announced today that Mussolini will deliver an important speech on March 26 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Party, mentioning Italy's demands. Fascist Party Secretary Starace issued an official statement saying that Mussolini will deliver an important speech to the Fascist troops, veterans, German Nazi leaders, and representatives of the Spanish Parliament at the Mussolini venue. (AP, 17th)

### Chamberlain's Resignation Untrue; Cabinet Inevitably to Be Reorganized; Labour Party Refuses Cooperation; Conscription to Be Implemented

(London) A Reuters parliamentary reporter said that members are widely speculating that Foreign Secretary Halifax is now initiating the organization of a new national unity government based on a broader foundation. Many Conservative MPs support this. It is said that the new government will recruit Eden and Churchill, and conscription may be submitted to Parliament. The purpose is to create a line that will never yield to Germany. Key Conservative MPs have not shown any signs of disagreement. Prime Minister Chamberlain feels pained by the recent developments in Central Europe, but compulsory national service and compulsory military service cannot be carried out without considering the attitude of the other side. It is heard that Labour MPs will take a cold attitude towards the proposal to expand the government, but the Liberal Party will not. The government previously avoided compulsory national service because of strong opposition from the Labour Party and trade unions. (Reuters, 17th)

(London) The rumors that British Prime Minister Chamberlain is about to resign are unfounded. (Reuters, 17th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a speech in Birmingham tonight. According to informed sources here, the Prime Minister will issue a serious warning to Germany regarding the partition of Czechoslovakia, and it is even possible to announce the strengthening of the national voluntary service system, thereby implementing compulsory military service. (Havas, 17th)

(London) Regarding the situation in Central Europe, the newspapers here all say that political figures are extremely anxious. When the Conservative parliamentary group met last night, many advocated that Britain should implement conscription. According to The Times, "The Conservative Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting yesterday to conduct a precise discussion on the European situation. Although many people attended, few criticized Prime Minister Chamberlain. It can be seen that although the Munich Agreement has produced bitter consequences, Prime Minister Chamberlain's position has not been damaged as a result. On the contrary, all the MPs clearly advocated the implementation of national service on a broad scale to be prepared for emergencies." (Havas, 17th)

(London) After the major changes in Central Europe, parliamentary figures here all said that the general staffs of Britain and France should conduct talks again to discuss cooperation methods, and the visit of French President Lebrun to Britain at the end of this month will be politically more important than expected as a result. The British and French governments have planned to jointly issue a declaration explaining the attitude that Britain and France should take when Switzerland or the Netherlands are invaded. Prime Minister Chamberlain will make an important declaration in Birmingham tonight and is currently deliberating the wording with a small cabinet meeting. In addition, all cabinet members said that the situation is evolving in such a way that the cabinet must make a strong and resolute statement in order to convince the majority of MPs and the people of the country. Among the MPs of all factions, some criticized the attitude expressed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon in the House of Commons yesterday as being too mild, and therefore were deeply dissatisfied. More than 200 Conservative MPs, at a meeting last night, although some criticized the current policy, still supported Prime Minister Chamberlain in the majority. Among them, Sir Knox said, "Now is not the time for official criticism, we must think about the future," and advocated changing the national voluntary service system to compulsory service. Those around Prime Minister Chamberlain said that the Prime Minister felt that he had been deceived by Hitler, but he should continue to work hard to save the situation and restore the reputation of the current policy. Foreign Secretary Halifax, due to the serious situation, advocated promoting conscription. (Havas, 17th)

(London) Someone proposed the implementation of conscription at the meeting of the Conservative Foreign Affairs Committee today. A large portion of the 120 attendees expressed their support. (Reuters, 17th)

(London) The rumours about the reorganization of the Cabinet are rife. Although the Conservative Party is eager to form a Cabinet of national unity, a key figure believes that as long as Prime Minister Chamberlain is in power, the opposition Labour Party will refuse to join the Cabinet for a single day. In other words, the Labour Party leaders regard the thorough change of the current domestic and foreign policies as a prerequisite for joining the Cabinet. In terms of foreign policy, the party advocates uniting all peaceful forces and maintaining frequent contact with the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and various small countries in Europe. In terms of domestic policy, the party absolutely does not want to promote conscription and compulsory service in peacetime. (Havas, 17th)

(London) During today's meeting of the House of Commons, opposition Labour MP Macklum asked the government whether it intended to recall the ambassador to Germany. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "The government is still considering whether to instruct Ambassador Henderson to return home to report." The Prime Minister's decision statement was highly valued by the general public, who believed that the government was considering negotiating with Germany over the Czech issue, or that the government was indeed planning to recall Ambassador Henderson, thereby expressing its dissatisfaction with Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia. In addition, the delegation of the Federation of British Industries, which is currently in Düsseldorf, Germany, negotiating with the German business community, originally planned to go to Berlin, but it is now learned that the plan has been abandoned and it has been decided to return directly to London tomorrow. Due to these various reasons, Parliament expects that the government may abandon its appeasement policy and work with the Soviet Union to promote friendship, replacing the understanding between Britain and Germany. Well-informed sources here have confirmed that the Cabinet will be reorganized immediately. Former Foreign Secretary Eden and former First Lord of the Admiralty Duff Cooper will enter the Cabinet, and even Churchill, the leader of the Conservative right wing, may also be in the list of cabinet members. Some even said that Prime Minister Chamberlain would resign within a short period of time. (Havas, 16th)

### Yan Xishan Discusses Military Affairs in Shanxi Province - Preparing for Long-Term Guerrilla Warfare - One Million Able-Bodied Men in Training - Over 10,000 Japanese Soldiers Annihilated in the Past Two Weeks

Reuters Special Correspondent's dispatch, March 10th (from General Yan Xishan's headquarters in a certain location in Shaanxi Province): After a week-long journey on horseback and in cars, the Reuters reporter finally arrived at the secret headquarters of General Yan Xishan, Commander-in-Chief of the Second War Area of China, which includes the entire province of Shanxi and parts of the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The headquarters is located in a

cave city in the mountainous region bordering Shaanxi. The geological structure of both Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces is ideally suited for excavating caves, and the Chinese army has made full use of this, as it can withstand air raids. The entire cliff face has been excavated into living quarters, offices, stables, etc. The reporter was invited to stay in a cave bedroom upon arrival, which was quite comfortable. The reporter was provided with a single-page daily newspaper published there to read. The next morning, I was informed that Mr. Yan was ready to receive me. I met Mr. Yan in another cave, the walls of which were covered with military maps, which was the location of the staff headquarters. Mr. Yan sat at the desk, wearing glasses on his nose, with

grey hair and a kind face, dressed in a blue provincial military uniform. To Mr. Yan's right was his Chief of Staff, Mr. Zhu, a burly man wearing a yellow woolen uniform of a central government officer. Mr. Yan said, "Japan is strong and China is weak, but we must deal with them. Therefore, we have reformed our strategy and will use our strength to attack the weaknesses of the Japanese. We have now begun to use the power of the entire people in the war and are training the military and civilians according to

three methods: (1) special training for officers, (2) training for the people, (3) training the army in guerrilla tactics. China is currently proceeding according to the following principles: (1) unity and cooperation between the military and civilians, (2) unity between officers and soldiers, (3) seizing opportunities to attack the enemy, (4) avoiding unnecessary losses. There are currently one million Shanxi people in training to assist the national army and destroy the Japanese. Most of their training is political. We must make them understand the meaning of this decisive battle, unite them, and

provide them with weapons. They have now made Japanese rule ineffective. Every time the Japanese occupy a place, the local government and post office move slightly backward and continue to perform their duties. In Shanxi Province, except for the three northern counties which have been merged and governed by one county magistrate, each of the remaining counties still has a county magistrate who performs his duties as usual. Even most of those called traitors are not truly traitors; many of them are serving us. Shanxi Province is now actively preparing for long-term guerrilla warfare. A large number of regular troops are moving behind Japanese lines to

encircle the Japanese and have established bases for self-sufficiency for the troops in the mountains. In addition to ammunition, these troops can rely on the villages for all their living needs, because the people's assistance is available at any time. Full attention is currently being paid to the issue of ammunition supply. It is estimated that there are more than fifty divisions in the occupied areas of Shanxi Province, two-thirds of which are regular troops. In the past two weeks, there have been a total of 240 battles within this war zone.

More than 10,000 Japanese soldiers were intercepted. The current new strategy is to avoid large-scale battles, so the above were only small skirmishes. Because the railways are often cut off, the Japanese have begun to build blockhouses along the railway lines. The Chinese army is preparing to attack them. In short, the Japanese will never gain true control of Shanxi Province," he said. When Mr. Yan left the mountain cave where we spoke, he rode a specially prepared healthy donkey back to his residence.

### Korean and Taiwanese Soldiers Unable to Endure Abuse - Mutiny Occurs in Foshan - Regiment Commander Araki Stabbed - Leading Soldiers Tragically Beheaded

Hong Kong Correspondence. Recent months in the Guangdong war situation have seen no significant changes, except for the Japanese army's sudden landing on Hainan Island. The positions of the Chinese and Japanese armies remain unchanged in the East River, North River, and West River, with no further developments. Although the Japanese army has repeatedly claimed to launch a major advance on the upper reaches of the Gan River to threaten Guangxi, and has launched continuous attacks in the Sanshui area, they have all been in vain and lack the real strength to break through the Chinese army's defense lines. In the past month, they have fallen silent, indicating that the Japanese army invading Guangdong is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. The war situation and other conditions in various parts of Guangdong Province are recorded below.

Raid on Leizhou Foiled

Since the Japanese army attacked Hainan Island, the situation in the Leizhou Peninsula in southern Guangdong has been extremely tense. With the war situation in various parts of Guangdong Province stagnating, the Japanese army's invasion of Guangxi will obviously seek another route. There are two new routes into Guangxi: one is to land on the Leizhou Peninsula and attack the rear of the Chinese army's positions in the West River, and the other is to land in Beihai in southern Guangdong, directly attack Nanning to the north, attack Liuzhou, and take Guilin. Therefore, around the Lunar New Year, Japanese warships gathered and shelled various coastal areas of Beihai and the Leizhou Peninsula. Japanese planes constantly bombed the aforementioned areas, especially Leizhou. However, due to the strict defense of the Chinese army on the shore and the complete destruction of road traffic, if the Japanese army landed and invaded, not only would they encounter strong resistance from the brave soldiers of Guangxi, but also continuous attacks from the local people. The mechanized troops would completely lose their effectiveness, and it is feared that they would be embarrassed in the future advance and retreat, causing the strength of South China to be further dispersed. Therefore, they have never dared to act rashly. The Leizhou Peninsula, which protrudes into the sea, and Beihai, which is isolated on the edge of Guangzhou Bay, remain as they were, because of this. However, the Japanese army's intention to advance from Guangdong to Guangxi is the main strategy in its South China war situation and will not be easily abandoned. Therefore, everyone knows that the opening of the war on the Leizhou Peninsula is only a matter of time. Indeed, on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of this month, Japanese planes bombed various important county towns along the coast of the Leizhou Peninsula, such as Haikang and Xuwen, causing heavy damage to civilian buildings. On the morning of the 6th, Japanese warships suddenly sailed into Shidao Port in Haikang, dispatching troops on more than a dozen motorboats, launching an attack and landing under the cover of fierce artillery fire. They engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese defending forces. After about an hour, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. The same thing happened in Xuwen, and the result was also unsuccessful. Therefore, the situation on the Leizhou Peninsula has been extremely tense in recent days. Residents in various places have retreated into the interior. The garrison is on strict alert. Traffic is cut off. The landscape is desolate, like a battlefield. However, this type of offensive is still exploratory. If the Japanese army is determined to land, the opening of the war will be extremely fierce.

Korean and Taiwanese Soldiers Mutiny in Guangdong

Most of the Japanese troops in various parts of Guangdong Province were transferred from Taiwan and the Northeast. Korean and Taiwanese soldiers account for half of them, and regular Japanese troops account for the other half. In the past, the Japanese troops who fought in China, whenever there were Korean and Taiwanese soldiers, they did not go to the front line to fight, because they were not only afraid that their fighting would be ineffective, which would harm the overall situation, but also strictly prevented them from defecting and mutiny. However, the Japanese troops invading Guangdong really had no soldiers to transfer from the country, and the front line was extended. Both the front and rear had to station heavy troops. They had no choice but to dig into their own flesh to make up for the sore, and transferred a large number of Korean and Taiwanese soldiers to join the war. However, it was because of this that mutinies often occurred in the Japanese army in Guangdong Province, whether in the front or rear. Recently, another mutiny occurred in Foshan. Because Foshan is close to Guangzhou, it made the Japanese army entrenched in the provincial capital extremely panicked. According to reports, the Japanese troops in Foshan have now been transferred to Hainan Island to fight. Most of the remaining troops are Korean and Taiwanese soldiers. Since the beginning of this year, a food shortage has occurred in various parts of Guangdong Province, which has also caused a serious famine in the Japanese army. They are still not full with one bowl of porridge and one bowl of rice a day. In addition, the Japanese treat Korean and Taiwanese soldiers worse. Salaries are not paid on a monthly basis. For these two reasons, more than a hundred Korean and Taiwanese soldiers stationed in Shiwanzhen, Foshan, mutinied at the beginning of the month. First, they demanded that Regiment Commander Araki pay off the arrears, and then stabbed him, scattering and harassing. When the Japanese artillery team stationed in Lanshi heard the news, they urgently telegraphed the Guangzhou Japanese Military Police Headquarters for help, and then came out to suppress them, arresting all the mutinying soldiers and escorting them to Guangzhou. On the morning of the 7th, more than a dozen leading mutinying soldiers were beheaded by the Japanese military police in Zhongshan Park in Guangzhou to show the public. The rest are still detained in the military police camp, waiting to be transported back to their country.

Food Problem in Various Parts of the Province

In addition to the war situation, there is a serious problem in the interior of Guangdong that needs to be rescued urgently, that is, the widespread and profound food panic. If there is no appropriate response to this question, the suffering of tens of millions of Guangdong people will become more and more serious. Guangdong Province is not a rice-producing area. Half of the province's food is supplied by Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. In the past, during the peaceful era, every early spring, when the old grain was exhausted and the new grain was not yet available, food panic would occur in the East River, Chaozhou-Shantou, and South Road areas. Since the outbreak of the war, the rice from Hunan and Jiangxi has been unable to be transported in, and the grain stored by farmers has been looted by the Japanese army. Moreover, spring plowing has been suspended, so the food panic has become more profound. Most of the people in the East River, West River, and North River have no rice to cook. The price of rice is soaring. One yuan is not enough to buy four catties of brown rice. Therefore, recently, local authorities have been extremely anxious. It is reported that the Guangdong authorities have jointly telegraphed the central government to approve the purchase of one million piculs of duty-free foreign rice for relief. However, this small amount is only enough to temporarily relieve the panic in the Chaozhou, Shantou, and Mei prefectures in eastern Guangdong and the vicinity of Beihai in northern Guangdong. Western and northern Guangdong still need to find ways to import domestic rice for relief. According to people from the interior, farmers in various parts of the West River and North River can still fill their stomachs with potatoes and other things. In the occupied areas of the East River, even miscellaneous grains have been exhausted. The suffering of the people is unspeakable and awaits the overall relief of the authorities. (March 12)

### Japanese Warships Harassing Sanmen Bay Sea Area

Ningbo Communication: Three small Japanese warships sailed into the waters off Jiantiao, Sanmen Bay, around 7:00 AM on the 14th, cruising back and forth, and put down small boats to strafe passing civilian ships with machine guns. At about 11:00 AM on the 15th, they put down a motorboat with more than a dozen soldiers, rushed to Maotou Mountain in Ninghai County, forcibly landed, and searched for civilian food, chickens, pigs, and other livestock. Later, the Chinese army arrived and, together with the people's team, fought hard to resist and drove the Japanese soldiers back to the ship. Currently, the three Japanese warships have retreated to the sea area more than fifty miles away from Jiantiao, harassing passing fishing boats.

### Banditry Rampant on Mount Putuo, Zhejiang

Dinghai Communication: Since the bandit gang led by Pan Zhao Cai landed on Mount Putuo on the 27th of last month, they have been entrenched on the mountain, looting everywhere. Recently, they have recruited scattered bandits and local ruffians, hooligans, and fugitives from nearby islands. Their momentum is growing day by day. They are now selling drugs and gambling, and sending leaders, such as Miao, to entrench themselves on Hulu Island. The bandit leader, Lin, is traveling on the sea by boat, intercepting passing merchant ships. The order of the entire mountain is chaotic, and pilgrims are reluctant to come.

### Forming Mutual Aid Associations to Relieve Displaced Refugees - Initiated by Wang Kunlun and Others

Chongqing Communication: Since the War of Resistance, more than tens of millions of people have fled from the provinces of North China, Central China, and Southeast China to the Northwest and Southwest to escape the chaos. They are displaced and miserable. Although they have received government relief, there is still much to be desired. The general refugees with meager assets have exhausted their resources in the past twenty months, and their future is very difficult. The general civil servants who have been evacuated are very difficult and their situation is pitiful. Now, Wang Kunlun and others have initiated a mutual aid association to gather members and sympathizers to carry out various social undertakings in the spirit of self-help and mutual assistance, improve the lives of refugees, and engage in production and construction. The general association is located on Shuncheng Street in Linjiang, Chongqing, and branch associations are set up throughout the Northwest and Southwest. It is heard that the association welcomes organizations from all over the country to establish branches in order to facilitate contact.

### Home of the Soldiers

— Chang

Kuang Mama from Guilin - Guangxi's Brave Sons are the Pride of Soldiers' Families

Yangshuo Communication: The Yangshuo County Government copied the names of nineteen soldiers from this city and decided to talk to the families of some of these patriotic soldiers.

At the end of a small alley on County Front Street, at the corner facing the low city wall along the Li River, there is a house with six or seven neat stone steps in front of the door. In this scholarly family, I found Chen Xiwei's eldest brother, Xixin, and his third younger brother, Xigao, who is studying in junior high school at the county high school. Xiwei is twenty-eight years old this year. He graduated from the cadre training class and the wireless electricity school. After the Lugouqiao Incident, he bravely joined Liao Lei's army to participate in the War of Resistance. I saw his recent letter from Li Huang County, Anhui, which said in essence: "... I sent two letters earlier to encourage my brother, and I am very worried about you. My body is as usual, don't worry. I heard that Guilin, Liuzhou, Pingle and other places have also suffered losses. I hope that brother Xin and brothers will build a thatched cottage in Shuangtan, our county, as soon as possible for temporary residence, so as to avoid panic and have extra land to cultivate. ..." Although it was simply written on a sheet of letter paper, it clearly shows his enthusiasm for protecting the country and loving his family.

His wife took his young son back to her mother's house to celebrate the New Year. I saw his two sons studying in the Central Elementary School. It is said that the youngest one has also entered kindergarten. The Guangxi Province originally stipulated that the families of soldiers on expeditions could receive 300 catties of preferential rice every year. Starting from last winter, it will be distributed quarterly in four installments. They have received nine yuan of Guangxi currency (four yuan and five jiao of legal tender) for the seventy-five catties of grain. His brothers and sons all believe that the expedition of their brothers and fathers is a glorious thing.

The second family member of a soldier I visited was Zheng Qiaoqiao's old father and elder brother. Their house is outside the city street, surrounded by patches of green vegetable gardens. A slippery and messy stone path runs through the side of his house. They have a vegetable garden, which is now cultivated by the old father. His elder brother is a butcher, and does not have the temperament of a farmer.

Qiaoqiao is the second child, twenty-seven years old this year. He has received reserve training. His wife has passed away. Two younger brothers are studying at the county elementary school for free. His family has not been greatly affected since the expedition. His old father said to me like a familiar friend: "Qiaoqiao was the first to enlist on the fourth day of August in the twenty-sixth year. I sent him to the North Gate of Guilin before I came back. Later, he formed a team in the county and then set off to the north. We received a letter from Hankou, which said in essence, "We will not fight until Shanghai, and then we will fight out of Shanhaiguan." He told us not to worry. The child is ambitious and I heard that he has been promoted to platoon leader." He pointed to another vegetable garden to the east of his house and said: "Xie Sijiu's son, Xie Qijin, is in Qiaoqiao's platoon."

"The government treats the families of soldiers on expeditions well. We have received a few Guangxi currency. The county magistrate has also rewarded us with five cents (two jiao and five fen of legal tender), and we have also received a few steamed buns and two packs of biscuits." The old gardener, who is almost sixty years old, happily told me. I took the opportunity to compliment him a few times. He suddenly remembered to invite me to drink tea. I thanked him and said: "I still want to go to Xie Qijin's house!" He still asked his eldest son to make tea while leading me out of the garden gate with a smile.

Although Xie Qijin's father was also planting a vegetable garden, his family was not as good as the old gardener who had a pig-killing son. Two rooms, one is the hall and the kitchen, and the other is the bedroom and pigsty. He seemed to talk to outsiders very little. He did not understand my words, and it was difficult for me to understand his words. After a long time, I learned that Qijin was eighteen years old and had not married a wife. He enlisted in early August two years ago and had received nine yuan of Guangxi currency. He said that he had not received anything else.

Xie Sijiu, whose eyes were a little blurred, took out his son's letter from his arms and showed it to me, saying: "His body is very good, please don't worry at home."

When I stepped out of Xie Sijiu's vegetable garden, the peaks of Yangshuo's suburbs were all covered in the sea of clouds. The fog was very thick and felt like light raindrops on my face. The fields were lush and green, which was pleasing to the eye. I saw that it was still early, so I followed the messy stone path, passed through the ancient city gate that looked like a stone bridge cave, which could be reached with one hand, and walked towards the cone-shaped Duxiu Peak. Xie Sijiu told me that Li Qiaosheng's house was under Duxiu Peak.

After bypassing an area of paddy fields, I gradually heard the sound of gurgling water. As the road turned, I saw that the stream water was divided into three layers, and each layer of more than one foot of stream water poured from a high place into a clear and green pool. It then flowed under a large rock floating on the surface of the water. A bend in the river, and there is a small round-hole bridge. The green moss on the bridge stones and the small flowers and plants in the stone cracks seemed to be reporting its ancient history to me. The water flowed across the bridge and made a small sound, heading towards a place I didn't know. Stepping over the rocks, Li Qiaosheng's three tile houses and two thatched houses in a secluded village were revealed behind the pine and bamboo and some tropical trees. This small bridge, flowing water, and family brought me into a wonderful poetic realm. At the same time, it was like seeing a painting by Wang Wei, "Streams and Mountains in Mist and Rain". That kind of extraordinary and refined scenery sent a thought of transcending the world.

I saw a young woman, wearing a bamboo hat, carrying buckets towards another direction. Although I couldn't determine whether she was Li Qiaosheng's wife, I knew that she was a member of this secluded village. Stepping into the fence gate, I let a small white dog bark softly behind me, walked across the small drying ground, and walked towards the tile house.

An old woman with white hair expressed a surprised welcome to me, the unexpected guest. She admitted that she was Li Qiaosheng's grandmother. She was warming herself by starting a fire on the ground in the hall with pine firewood. The pine firewood was still wet, emitting a stinging white smoke. I pulled a low stool and sat down by the fire and asked about Li Qiaosheng's family. She told me that Qiaosheng's mother had gone to the market to sell vegetables, and Qiaosheng's wife had gone out to collect pig feed because the family had two pigs.

She hurriedly ran out of the house, stood outside the fence gate, and shouted in a loud voice like a middle-aged woman. Then I heard another loud voice also shouting. Thanks to the echoes from the surrounding mountains, this lovable old woman only shouted three times and called her grandson's wife back.

Li Qiaosheng's wife put the pole on the drying ground, like a young farmer, and followed her old grandmother into the hall. She took off the big, round, yellow and shiny bamboo hat, revealing her head wrapped in blue floral cloth. Her fair face, slender eyebrows, and a pair of dignified eyes were a rare beauty for a Guangxi farmer. Her wide chest indicated that she had a child to breastfeed. Her blue cloth trousers, revealing her calves, and bare big feet indicated that she was as strong and hardworking as other Guangxi farmers. When asked about her husband, she was unable to say anything. Fortunately, the old grandmother asked her question by question on my behalf, and she only answered me slowly.

Li Qiaosheng is her son-in-law who lives in her family. He is twenty-seven years old this year. He enlisted in the army after marriage, and this year is the fifth year. In June two years ago, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, and the troops in this province went to the north. He passed by Yangshuo and stayed at home for three days. Now there are his mother, sister, grandmother, and a son who has been separated from his father since birth in the family.

She went into a dark room to get two letters that had already been torn and showed them to me, saying: "The most recent one was sent to the county government. (Later I learned that the Guangxi Provincial Government would order each county to collect the soldier's family letters that can be used as a model.) These are letters from July of the year before last and last year." I saw "Li Qiaosheng's Mother Received" written on the first letter. Inside it said, "The soldiers on expeditions have certificates, which can exempt them from all civil engineering costs. If the village office wants you to go to civil engineering, take the certificate to see, you are strong, don't worry." The second letter was sent from the "An Yuan No. 62 Rear Hospital in Pingxiang, Jiangxi". It was undoubtedly "injured in battle", but it was not mentioned in the letter. It only said that his body was very good. Looking at his wife, she still didn't know.

When I asked about "preferential treatment", Li Qiaosheng's wife became excited. She told me: "At the end of last year, I received nine Guangxi currency. The county magistrate also personally sent steamed buns and biscuits here." She also pointed to the red paper strip with the words "Strive for Glory for the Country" in the center of the door panel in the hall and said: "He also put this glorious paper strip on for us!"

Seeing that the scenery in front of the door was gradually darkening, I said goodbye to them. A burst of baby's crying came from the dark back. I asked the young mother to take care of the child quickly, but I could not refuse the old woman's enthusiasm to send me out of the fence. When I walked over the big rock floating on the stream, I turned around and took a last glimpse of the secluded village under Duxiu Peak. She was still standing there. Li Qiaosheng's wife was holding a fat son close to her. The little white dog wagged its short tail at their feet. I waved my hand and asked them to go in. The messy stone path turned a bend, and the rain-covered trees cut it off.

### Northern Jiangsu Refugees Flee to Shanghai

An estimated crowd of over a thousand people. Chinese troops will prepare a counter-offensive.

According to the North-China Daily News, the situation in northern Jiangsu is tense due to military operations. Over a thousand people from the area, in several boats, fled to Shanghai yesterday (the 16th). They were thoroughly inspected by the public concession police stationed at Pier 12 before landing. According to those who arrived in Shanghai on the British ship "Kristin Maersk," they came here because of the tense situation in northern Jiangsu.

The majority are carrying bedding and other miscellaneous items, indicating that they intend to stay here for some time. The British ship also brought pigs, chickens, and other goods from northern Jiangsu. Chinese sources previously reported that war clouds were gathering in the Jiangbei area along the river. As many as 90,000 Chinese regular troops and guerrillas are rushing to various strategic locations to prepare for an offensive against the Japanese army. According to those who came to Shanghai yesterday, the counter-offensive has not officially begun. The battles north of Taizhou and Shaobo are already underway. The battles occurred several days before they came to Shanghai.

There had been fighting before they set off, but it had subsided. A village north of Taizhou has fallen. As for the situation in areas such as Nantong and Qidong, which were previously reported to be preparing for an offensive by the Chinese army, they did not know. It is also reported that the Japanese army is attempting to attack these areas in order to cut off the supplies of the Chinese army operating in the area and to monopolize the area by preventing shipping, allowing Japanese shipping companies to exclusively profit.

### Ningbo Gentry Petition to Purchase Foreign Rice to Aid Ningbo's Food Supply

Telegraph to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to forward to the Ministry of Finance for approval.

Shanghai-based gentry and merchants from Ningbo, Yu Qiaqing and Jin Tingsun, etc., because Ningbo is not a rice-producing area, and after the war, Shanghai controlled the re-export of rice, so the food supply for the people was often inadequate. They sent a letter to the Ningbo County government, seeking a joint petition to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to forward to the Ministry of Finance, requesting approval to purchase foreign exchange to order 50,000 to 100,000 shi of Saigon and Siam foreign rice to regulate the food supply in Zhejiang Province. It has already been approved by the Ningbo County government, so Yu and others jointly telegraphed Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province requesting it.

### The Czech Embassy in Shanghai Taken Over by the German Embassy

The Czech Minister and his wife have moved. Czech expatriates are in a state of grief and indignation.

Czech expatriates in Shanghai have been quite anxious since receiving the latest news from Europe. They expressed anger at the developments following Hitler's sudden invasion on Wednesday. However, most Czech expatriates were too shocked to offer any criticism. The Czech Minister to China, Seba, etc., continued to work as usual at the embassy at 727 Haig Road in the city every day before the 15th, but the outside world paid close attention to their movements. According to the minister's statement to the outside world the day before yesterday, he was waiting for instructions. However, on the 16th, the embassy gate was suddenly closed, which made the Czech expatriates in Shanghai even more anxious. It was learned yesterday (the 17th) that the embassy had been taken over by personnel sent by the German Embassy, and the Czech Minister Seba had moved out of the embassy and temporarily resided in a hotel with his wife. After this news spread, the Czech expatriates were very sad and indignant. However, whether the future fate and the management of commercial property in Shanghai must be transferred to the German Embassy, or whether they must obtain "protection" passports, remains to be seen. There are many Czech expatriates in Shanghai, and the exact number is not yet known. They occupy a prominent position in Shanghai's social and business circles. Bata Shoe Company, one of the world's largest shoe companies, is a Czech business and has no fewer than seven branches in Shanghai alone. In peacetime, branches are also located in Hangzhou, Hankou, Suzhou, Tianjin, and Qingdao.

### External Transfer of Postal Workers Soon to Depart

The Bureau Accepts Four Requests

Recently, the Directorate General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications, due to the accumulation of mail in Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces, which urgently needs to be sorted out, and because the work efficiency of postal workers in the interior is relatively slow, ordered the Shanghai Postal Administration to select 65 capable postal workers to work in each of these provinces. After receiving the order, the post office selected 65 capable postal workers and issued a bureau order, requiring them to depart uniformly by the 16th of this month. After receiving the news, the transferred personnel felt that the matter was sudden and there was not enough time to arrange luggage, and that the treatment was meager, which caused many difficulties. The Postal Workers' Union submitted a request to the bureau to cancel the above order and change it to voluntary registration for external transfer, but the authorities did not approve it, which caused dissatisfaction among the postal workers.

The Bureau Accepts Four Conditions: The Postal Workers' Union and the Trade Union, in order to prevent disputes from occurring, convened a joint meeting to discuss countermeasures. The result was a resolution to obey the government's order and accept the external transfer, but to postpone the departure date and make four requests: (1) During the extraordinary period, the transferred personnel should receive a living allowance in addition to maintaining their original subsidies; (2) The deadline for travel expenses for the families of the transferred personnel should be specially extended; (3) The transferred personnel should be transferred back to the Shanghai Bureau for service as soon as possible when the following situations occur: A. When the service location evacuates bureau personnel, B. When the war is won, C. When the local business is not needed; (4) If the families of the transferred personnel need to mail necessities such as clothing to the transferred personnel themselves, they can send them free of charge. The representatives of the two associations then presented the requests to Postmaster General Chapellin and Postal Assistant Wang Weisheng, who sincerely accepted them. They have been submitted to the Directorate General for approval and are expected to be approved.

Preparing Luggage and Departing on Schedule: After the bureau accepted the four requests and agreed to postpone the departure date, the postal workers, in order to obey the order and take care of the overall situation, unanimously agreed to the external transfer and scheduled to leave Shanghai successively on April 1. These days they are arranging their families and preparing their luggage. They will first take a boat to Wenzhou, then transfer to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in Jinhua and go to various provinces. The bureau has already purchased boat tickets from the Audit Department. At the same time, the Postal Workers' Union purchased medicines and food for the trip. Letters were also sent to the Postal Workers' Unions along the way, asking them to take good care of the postal workers when they arrive. At that time, postal workers will also go to the dock to see them off.

### Evaluation Committee Investigates Rice Warehouse Stocks

Arrivals are quite strong, rice prices continue to fall. The serious situation is gradually becoming a thing of the past.

### Write to the authorities to carefully plan good strategies to maintain this permanently.

The Shanghai Rice Industry Association Evaluation Committee sent a letter to the authorities of the two concessions yesterday, reporting on the establishment process and submitting the assessed rice price list for filing. In the future, the method of investigating the rice stocks in Shanghai will be stipulated at any time. Arrivals have been strong in recent days, and rice prices are becoming more stable. The details are recorded below:

Dispatch Personnel to Investigate Stocks at Any Time: The Rice Industry Association Evaluation Committee, considering that the stock levels are greatly related to rice prices, has dispatched specialists to conduct investigations of rice stocks in various rice warehouses at any time, and has compiled an investigation form, which is quite detailed, including items such as the name of the warehouse, the name of the manager, the capacity, and the address of the rice warehouse. After the investigation form is completed, it will be sent to the seven rice industry associations and reported to the authorities of the two concessions for filing. The association sent a letter to each rice warehouse yesterday to assist in this procedure.

Arrivals are Quite Strong, Rice Prices Continue to Fall: Since the Soybean and Rice Industry Association earnestly persuaded vendors to resume transportation and continue procurement, arrivals have been quite strong in recent days, and rice prices have continued to fall. White japonica rice has fallen back to 13.45 yuan or 78 cents per shi, which is below the assessed price limit. It is heard that various vendor merchants are following the advice of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association and are continuing to procure, and the sources will become more prosperous. Therefore, the serious situation of rice shortages in the city is gradually becoming a thing of the past.

Assessed Rice Prices Reported for Filing: The following letter was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession Council yesterday: "Dear Sirs, Recently, the food supply for Shanghai residents has been affected by the direct loading and transportation of rice from the interior to other places, resulting in scarce sources and rising rice prices. The Soybean and Rice Industry Association decided to maintain the original price limit, with the highest price of white rice not exceeding 14 yuan per shi, and reported the situation to your council for filing on the 8th of this month. Subsequently, although the market price limit has fortunately not been exceeded, the prices of middle and inferior rice have risen uniformly, and the market has become slightly chaotic. The rice industry associations believe that the failure to stabilize rice prices is a major concern for the food supply, and on the 13th of this month, the Soybean and Rice Industry Association invited representatives from the Rice Store Association, the Rice Grain Retail Association, the Shanghai Northern Rice Merchant Association, the Rice Milling Association, the Changshu Guildhall, and the Southern Guildhall to jointly resolve to organize an Evaluation Committee. The committee will assess prices at any time based on the price limit set by the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, differentiating between middle and inferior grades, with the aim of cooperation between the shipping, vendor, and store parties to jointly maintain the stability of rice prices. Fifteen members were elected by the various organizations, and the first committee meeting was convened on the 15th of this month to formulate simple rules and announce the establishment. This is the origin of the organization of our committee. However, at a time when stocks are not lacking, but sources are still not prosperous, it is feared that our efforts will not be able to bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing rice prices from beginning to end. We hope that your council will carefully plan good strategies to jointly maintain the food supply for the people. This is especially what our committee deeply prays for. We hereby enclose the committee's simple rules, the list of committee members, and the assessed rice price list for your review and filing. We are deeply grateful."

### Japanese Side Obstructs Foreign Shipping: Haimen Attacked by Cannon Fire Again

Companies will request consuls to negotiate resumption of shipping methods. Resumption will inevitably be postponed.

Haimen, Zhejiang, was bombarded by Japanese warships again on the 15th, with minimal damage. The local situation is as peaceful as usual. The Ningbo-Taizhou route is preparing to resume. The Shanghai-Taizhou route still needs to be awaited. The Shanghai-Dinghai route allows dedicated ships to load fish. The Hana will depart from Dinghai for Shanghai for the first time on the 20th. The details are recorded below:

Japanese Warships Repeatedly Bombard Haimen: After the Japanese warships repeatedly bombarded and harassed Haimen, Zhejiang, without success, it was recently reported by the shipping industry that at 4 p.m. on the 15th of this month, four Japanese warships sailed from the Damenshan area to the vicinity of the Jiaojiang Estuary blockade line, first launching speedboats to scout and then firing 80 to 90 shells at the urban area of Haimen, injuring nine people and destroying dozens of houses, with no other losses. Two of the Japanese warships seized three civilian ships around 5 p.m. and sailed away, while the other two remained anchored overnight and then sailed away.

The Military and Civilians are Calm and the Situation is Peaceful: Since the Japanese side had designs on Haimen, our military authorities have stepped up defenses and stationed heavy troops along the coast, while evacuating residents and investigating traitors who spread rumors. Although Japanese warships have repeatedly intruded, they have ultimately failed due to our strong defenses. When they fired again on the 15th, our troops calmly responded. Seeing that we were prepared, the Japanese warships did nothing but fire aimlessly. Therefore, the situation in Haimen is now extremely peaceful. Shops are open as usual, and residents are accustomed to the Japanese warships firing and are extremely calm.

The Intention is Clearly to Obstruct Navigation: Haimen and Jiaojiang have been blockaded, and shipping has been suspended for a long time. In order to facilitate transportation, the authorities are dredging the Jiaojiang waterway and re-registering ships to prepare for resumption of shipping. However, the Japanese side has made excuses for unfinished military affairs and has obstructed the effort, preventing it from being realized. Recently, the authorities approved the request of shipping companies to allow registered ships to anchor at Sanjiangkou, more than 20 li away from Haimen, to load and unload passengers and cargo. However, the Japanese warships bombarded Haimen again on the 15th, with the intention of obstructing foreign shipping. Various foreign shipping companies will request their respective consuls to negotiate in order to maintain shipping.

Resumption of the Shanghai-Taizhou Route Needs to be Awaited: After the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander approved the request of shipping companies to allow ships to anchor at Sanjiangkou to load and unload passengers and cargo, the Marler ship managed by the Ningbo-Shaoxing Company tried sailing once and was quite satisfied. The Golden ship, which operates on the Ningbo-Taizhou route, is also preparing to resume shipping. Therefore, the resumption of the Shanghai-Taizhou route is of great concern to all sectors. Sanjiangkou is located in a remote area, and passenger and cargo transportation is sluggish. The ships do not intend to resume shipping for the time being. Therefore, the resumption of the Shanghai-Taizhou route will have to be awaited. As for the Ningbo-Taizhou route, it will resume shipping first.

Dinghai Temporarily Resumes Shipping for Fish Loading: In order to consolidate the defenses of various small ports along the coast, the Zhejiang authorities prohibited ships from docking in Dinghai. The Shanghai-Dinghai route has been suspended for a long time. Now, local fishermen and merchants, in order to transport fresh fish, have submitted a request to the authorities to hire the Hana Hayford as a dedicated ship for transporting fish directly to Shanghai, but ships traveling from Shanghai must transit through Ningbo and Bay, and the carrying of passengers is strictly prohibited. It is learned that the Hana is scheduled to depart from Dinghai for Shanghai for the first time on the 20th (Monday) to load fish, but this resumption of shipping is still temporary in nature.

### The New Japanese Traffic Regulations, Not Valued By The Municipal Council, Seemingly Will Order Police To Obey, Except For Japanese Nationals, Not Bound By Them

The "Continental Daily" reports that regarding the implementation of the new traffic regulations by the Japanese side in the area north of the Suzhou Creek, the Shanghai Municipal Council is still in the process of taking formal action. Although officials acknowledged yesterday (the 16th) that the implementation of the traffic regulations stipulated by the Japanese Naval Landing Force has slightly undermined the administrative integrity of the Public Concession, judging from the phenomena last night, the Council seemed to be ordering the Public Concession police to abide by these rules. When reporters asked several members of the Council about this matter yesterday, they

Attempted To Reduce The Importance Of This Matter. It was claimed that the commander of a certain foreign military district, if he believes that expanding its rules is necessary to better protect life and property in the district, it seems to be a legitimate action. However, officials have not yet issued any statements or intentions. The Council only received the new regulations submitted by the Japanese side on Tuesday. The Japanese Landing Force authorities

Did Not Await The Council's Reply, and announced the regulations the next day, stating that they would be implemented from Tuesday, the 14th of this month. It is said that the Council is still considering these new traffic regulations. According to one Council member, the Council will consider whether these regulations are implemented by the Council or by other authorities, as it would harm the integrity of the Public Concession. It is also claimed that without the approval of the Public Concession Police Department and the foreign consulates, the implementation of these new regulations, except for

Japanese Nationals, Will Not Affect Other Foreign Nationals. For example, any foreigner other than a Japanese national who enjoys extraterritoriality, if he violates one of these new regulations, will be accused of violating the traffic regulations to his consular authorities. However, if the consular court does not recognize the legal right of the Japanese Landing Force to amend the rules, the charges against the foreigner will be automatically dropped. Chinese and foreigners who do not enjoy extraterritoriality and violate the regulations will be dealt with by the Special Court No. 1, as the Special Court No. 1 is the only court in the Public Concession

With The Power To Govern Them. Unless the Special Court No. 1 recognizes the Japanese regulations, we will not punish violators. It is said that the Council may put pressure on the Special Court No. 1, but the Council has no power to influence the courts of foreign consulates. Therefore, if the Special Court No. 1 implements these regulations for some reason, the result will be unfair discrimination, favoring foreigners who enjoy extraterritoriality. According to the Japanese regulations, there is no significant difference from the regulations of the Police Department, except for the addition of prohibitions on smoking while driving, vehicle speed, parking locations, etc.

### Temporary Supplementary Measures for the Levy of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax in War Zones, First Levied on Branches in Non-Occupied War Zones, But Those with Huge Losses May Be Granted Deferred Levy After Proof

The Ministry of Finance has announced the following temporary supplementary measures for the levy of the first category (profit-seeking enterprise income tax): (1) For profit-seeking enterprises with branches in war zones, if the capital and the head office are not clearly separated and the income can actually be calculated together, it should still be calculated together. (2) If the above-mentioned profit-seeking enterprises cannot calculate their income together due to road obstruction, loss of books, etc., the income of the head office and branches not in war zones should be calculated together first. (3) If all the branches are in war zones and cannot be calculated together, the income of the head office not in war zones should be calculated separately first. (4) If the head office is in a war zone and cannot be calculated together, the income of each branch not in war zones should be calculated separately first. (5) According to the second and third items, the head office outside the war zone should deduct the funds allocated to the branches in the war zone from the original capital amount, and the remaining amount should be the capital amount, and the tax should be levied according to the tax rate in Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations. (6) According to the fourth item, the income of each branch outside the war zone calculated separately should be taxed according to the tax rate in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations. (7) According to the fourth item, the income of each branch outside the war zone calculated separately should be taxed according to the tax rate in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations. (8) Even if the business calculated separately according to the previous third and fourth items has a surplus, but the branches or head office in the war zone have suffered substantial losses, they may submit sufficient proof to the competent tax collection authority for approval to defer the levy. (9) For those who calculate and levy taxes according to the previous second, third, and fourth items, after the war is over, they should be combined with the branches or head office that were in the war zone to calculate the tax, and refunds should be made separately. (10) Each office should prepare a separate registration book for profit-seeking enterprises that are levied taxes according to the previous second, third, and fourth items for future reference when handling tax refunds.

### The Pseudo "Reformed Government" Handles Transit Taxes: The Taxes are Very High, and Public Grievances are Boiling

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the "Reformed Government" established a transit tax earlier this month. This move can achieve two benefits: one is that various daily necessities will not be transported from the provinces under the jurisdiction of the "Reformed Government" to other places, and the other is that the "Reformed Government" can obtain a monthly tax revenue of 1.2 million yuan for relief purposes. Various goods, such as leather, livestock, rice, wheat, other cotton, eggs, and raw silk, are subject to a special price tax of 5% to 20%. Because the "Reformed Government" has a large shortage of daily necessities due to the transportation of goods produced in its jurisdiction to other ports, it has closed all ports along the Yangtze River except for 14 (including Jiangyin, Tianshenggang, Hupu, Fushan, and Bawugang), and dispatched "Pacification Teams," police, and the Japanese army to prevent smuggling in the ports.

### American Asiatic Fleet - Change of Command - Rear Admiral Hottle to Succeed

Rear Admiral Yarnell, commander of the American Asiatic Fleet, returned to the United States from Shanghai last month. His position had remained vacant until now. According to news from Washington, D.C., the successor will be Rear Admiral Hottle, head of the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships. It is understood that Hottle has been ordered to the Asiatic Fleet command. Hottle is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of May or early June of this year. Hottle served as an adjutant in the American Asiatic Fleet from 1920 to 1922. He participated in the Spanish-American War, and also made distinguished contributions during World War I. He was promoted to his current position in 1929. This is Hottle's first time coming to China.

### French Military Parade

Yesterday at 1 PM, the French Defense Forces stationed in Shanghai, with ten tanks and artillery vehicles, two platoons of French soldiers (over fifty men each), two platoons of Annamite soldiers, fully armed, and with artillery vehicles, paraded on Avenue Edward VII. The procession was led by four motorcycle escorts, followed by French officers overseeing the troops, moving from west to east, towards the Bund.

### Foreign Minister of the Puppet "Reformed Government" - Wang Yintai to Succeed - Wang Practiced Law in Shanghai for Years

The Continental Daily reports that after the assassination of Chen Lu at his residence in Shanghai, the position of Foreign Minister of the puppet "Reformed Government" was left vacant. It was learned yesterday (the 16th) that Wang Yintai, who until recently was a partner in a law firm in Shanghai, has been appointed as the Foreign Minister of the puppet "Reformed Government". Wang has been involved in politics for a long time. He studied law in Germany in 1909 and returned to China in 1913. He held important positions in the Beijing government and served as an advisor to Zhang Zuolin in 1922. In 1926, he served as Minister of Justice. From 1930, he practiced law in Shanghai, with his office located at 212 Jiangxi Road.

### Second Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week - Today is Women's Propaganda Day - Eight Instructions for Female Compatriots - Various Women's Organizations Issue Open Letter to Female Compatriots

Today is the Women's Propaganda Day of the Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week, led by the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters. Shanghai women's organizations have jointly issued an open letter to female compatriots of this city, pointing out the close relationship between the anti-Japanese reconstruction effort and the liberation of women in detail, and listing eight tasks that female compatriots should strive for in the future. They are reproduced below:

Female compatriots of this city, now is the true opportunity for us women to seek liberation and fight for equality. Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling instructs us, "We must recognize that women's liberation should not be viewed simply as a right, but as a responsibility. Why do we seek women's liberation? It is to fulfill our responsibilities as women. In other words, if we truly want to achieve women's liberation, we must first be able to shoulder responsibilities." This is truly a profound and insightful saying, a guiding principle for the women's liberation movement.

In Madame Chiang's words, the errors of our past women's liberation movement are implicitly pointed out. In the past, we only competed with men for equality in rights, such as women's economic independence, equal education, and women's suffrage. We focused on reclaiming the rights that men had solely controlled. What was the result of this movement after a long period of struggle? Wasn't it just a superficial victory? Although women can now participate in social activities, inherit property, seek employment, pursue education, and engage in politics just like men, the fundamental power remains in the hands of men, as in the past. The superficial victory we have achieved has only become an adornment and decoration for the male-dominated society. It is not that we women do not know how to strive or are unwilling to improve, but the forces of history and society are too strong. The male-dominated society has deep-rooted and long-standing traditions not only in our country but throughout the world. It is truly difficult to fundamentally overthrow the social structure that has been gradually built up since history and achieve true equality between men and women, no matter how hard we try, with our fragile and nascent power. The only hope is to seize the opportunity of history. When the entire nation and country undergo a great revolution, we should bravely rise up and strive to create great achievements in history, demonstrate the powerful strength we can contribute to the country, and not let men take all the credit. Then our women's liberation movement will naturally be thoroughly successful and realized in the leap forward of the times.

The current stage is a golden opportunity for us women to seek liberation and fight for equality. Our country and our nation are at a critical juncture of survival under the invasion and attack of violent enemies. After twenty months of bloody resistance, the fate of our country and nation has turned from a dangerous situation to the road of revival. Our desire for women's liberation and equality can be promoted and realized in this sacred and great era. Therefore, Madame Chiang instructs us, "We must use the power of our women to achieve the liberation of the entire nation and fulfill our responsibilities." This tells us that in the current work of seeking the liberation of the entire nation, our female compatriots should shoulder the same responsibilities as men. When the liberation of the entire nation is achieved, the liberation of our women will naturally follow. Dear sisters, in this second stage of the War of Resistance, we should not let men bear the arduous responsibilities alone. We should follow Madame Chiang's instructions and take on the following missions: (1) Promote thrift; (2) Encourage production; (3) Promote social education; (4) Manage relief efforts; (5) Encourage young men to enlist; (6) Assist in anti-Japanese propaganda; (7) Comfort and assist the families of soldiers going to war; (8) Assist the families of soldiers going to war, organize small crafts, impart agricultural technology, and establish cooperatives.

### Chinese Aircraft Bomb Japanese Ships in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River - Escorting Japanese Ship also Heavily Damaged - Remaining Ship Turns Back and Flees to Shanghai

According to sources, two Japanese transport ships, the "Phoenix Sun Maru" and the "Daikichi Maru," loaded large quantities of provisions at the Mitsubishi Wharf and the China Merchants North Wharf in Hongkou on the 8th of this month. They sailed out of Songkou together, heading up the Yangtze River to Wuhan to resupply the Japanese troops trapped in central Hubei. A Japanese warship accompanied them for protection. Between the 12th and 13th, as they were sailing on the river between Nanjing and Jiujiang, they suddenly encountered two brave Chinese aircraft, which bombed them. The "Phoenix Sun Maru" was faster and carried more cargo than the "Daikichi Maru," so it was several tens of miles ahead. The Japanese warship followed closely. The Chinese aircraft engaged in a fierce air-sea battle. The Chinese pilots were skilled and maneuvered freely, accurately dropping bombs on the Japanese warship and the "Phoenix Sun Maru." The "Phoenix Sun Maru" was sunk to the bottom of the river. The Japanese warship was also heavily damaged. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the "Daikichi Maru" quickly turned around and fled downstream, unloading the provisions in Nanjing. The empty ship returned to Shanghai on the 15th. It is reported that the sunk "Phoenix Sun Maru" was originally a Yangtze River liner of the Japanese Nisshin Company. After the war, it was requisitioned by the Japanese Navy and converted into a transport ship with a displacement of several thousand tons.

### Ding Xueshan's Troops Inflict Heavy Blow on Puppet Troops in Songjiang

The puppet troops in Songjiang, belonging to Xu Pucheng's "Jiangsu-Zhejiang Pacification Army," were suddenly attacked by Ding Xueshan's guerrilla troops, who were ambushing along the railway line, the night before last (the 15th). During the fierce battle between the two sides, Xu Pucheng disguised himself and fled far away with his entourage. The puppet troops had no fighting spirit and were easily defeated after this major change. They all abandoned their weapons and fled. In this battle, Ding's troops captured a large number of light and heavy weapons and took control of the four suburbs of Songjiang.

### Li Zhiming's Troops Inflict Heavy Casualties on Japanese Troops in Fengxian - Fierce Battles at Tai Ri Bridge and Qingcun Port - Most Japanese Troops Retreat to Lujiahui

Five days ago, when more than 200 Japanese and puppet troops invaded Qianjiaqiao in Pudong, they were bravely resisted by Li Zhiming's Fourth Brigade of the Loyal Salvation National Army, led personally by the battalion commander Chuan Shengchang, with a machine gun squad and the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th companies. After more than an hour of fierce fighting, the Fifth Brigade also arrived one after another and took up an encirclement formation, launching a fierce attack on the Japanese troops.

The Japanese troops were tied up front and back, and fearing their rear would be cut off, they retreated in defeat towards Nanqiao. In this battle, nine Japanese soldiers were killed and more than ten were wounded. At 9:15 AM the next morning, the Japanese troops mobilized more than 400 Japanese and puppet troops from Zhoupu and Xinchang and launched a fierce attack on the Tai Ri Bridge command post in three routes. Commander Li Zhiming personally led the Special Service Battalion to meet the enemy near Tai Ri Bridge. After two hours of fierce fighting, both sides

suffered casualties. Ultimately, due to the intense Japanese artillery fire, Li retreated to a new position to avoid excessive sacrifices. He then mobilized his strong forces to launch a counterattack on Tai Ri Bridge at noon. Fearing Li's miraculous use of troops, the Japanese troops set fire to more than a dozen civilian houses, killing and wounding more than a dozen civilians, and retreated towards Lujiahui. At 2 PM on the same afternoon, the Japanese troops again drew more than 200 troops from Nanqiao to

attack Qingcun Port. Li's First Brigade, led by Lu Zhiyang, bravely repelled them. The Japanese troops then fled to Fengxian city, where they were ambushed by Li's Third Brigade. In this battle, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated towards Nanqiao.

### British Ambassador Visits Jewish Refugee Camp

### Offering Prayers to Ma Xiangbo - Thanksgiving Mass Held - Alumni of Xuhui High School - Hold Regular Ceremony at the School

Mr. Ma Xiangbo, baptismal name Joseph, is an early alumnus of Xuhui High School in this city. The school is holding a celebration in honor of Mr. Ma's 100th birthday this year.

### Raising Funds for Vocational Training Center - One Yuan Fund Campaign - Donations are Very Enthusiastic

The Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center has been in operation for over a year, establishing ten workshops including carpentry, toy making, embroidery, laundry, towel bleaching and dyeing, soap making, glove making, paper box making, and printing. According to the planned schedule, it is progressing step by step. It has been filed with the National Government Relief Committee and has been inspected and commended by special commissioners. However, due to the lack of a fixed fund, all expenses are stretched thin. Therefore, a One Yuan Fund Campaign Committee has been formed to request assistance from all sectors of society, hoping to pool the strength of the community and benefit the refugees. In recent days, copperplate engravings showing the current state of the center and donation forms with announcements from the One Yuan Fund Campaign Committee have been sent to major commercial firms. Since the start of the fundraising campaign, it has received strong support from all sectors, and donations have been very enthusiastic.

### Shanghai Refugee Relief Association - Management Policy of the Reception Centers

The First and Second Reception Centers run by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association can accommodate more than 13,000 people. At the beginning of the preparation, the chairman of the association, Yu Qiaqing, and the board members jointly appointed Cai Renbao, a member of the executive committee and deputy director of the office, to be in charge. Recently, the chairman of the association, Yu Qiaqing, the secretary-general, Yuan Ludeng, Wei Bozhen, and the director of the office, Xu Caicheng, have appointed Cai to concurrently serve as the director of the general management office of the reception centers. In addition to hiring voluntary specialists in the general management office to be responsible for legal, accounting, nutrition, and inspection, directly managing the association's reception centers, Cai also went to the First Reception Center on Dunxin Road the morning before yesterday to give the following speech to all staff members: "Colleagues, since our association started running the reception centers, we have held many talks. Recently, there have been some personnel changes. New colleagues have not heard the past talks, and some of the old colleagues have not been able to implement them effectively. So today, I have to have another thorough talk with you all." (To be continued)

The delivery of opium, which used to be done regularly, has been temporarily suspended. As for well-known gambling dens such as Hollywood, Rongsheng Company, Liusheng Company, and Guangsheng Company, they have received warnings and bombs for several consecutive days, ordering them to close within three days, or they will be destroyed by a large number of bombs, regardless of the innocent. The gambling dens again received phone calls the day before yesterday, which were the guerrillas urging them to close down. Therefore, the owners have stopped going, and a group of gamblers are also treading carefully and refraining from going.

### Police Department Raids Bookstores

Yesterday morning, the number one white japonica rice at the Santai Rice Shop on Avenue Joffre was sold for 14 yuan and 20 cents, exceeding the limited price.

### Gambling Den Traitors Assault and Insult Chinese Police Officer Sentenced to Seven Months Imprisonment Each

Li Pinquan from Nanjing, formerly serving in the Municipal Public Security Bureau, after the fall of Shanghai, relied on the special forces in the western part of Shanghai, gathered his accomplices, and opened a "Guangsheng Company" gambling den in a lane on Bailinan Road outside the concession police jurisdiction. For several months, the profits from the commission, after deducting the protection fees, were substantial. On the 14th of this month, because a

sedan car temporarily stopped at the entrance of the lane, Li caught sight of it and, considering it an obstruction to the entry and exit of cars carrying gamblers to and from the gambling den, immediately summoned Wu Xiufeng, a bouncer in the den, to make trouble for the chauffeur. Chinese Police Officer No. 2549, stationed on Bailinan Road by the Jing'an Temple Police Station, saw this and tried to stop them. Unexpectedly, Li and Wu, relying on their protective charm, wanted to

forcibly drag the police officer into the lane to act violently. The police officer then fired a warning shot in self-defense. Officers from the neighboring post heard the sound and rushed over, cooperating to arrest Li and Wu. Although Chinese and Western detectives from the jurisdiction police station later found that Li had committed robbery and murder in the western district in recent years, the locations of the incidents were all outside the concession, and there was no need to overstep their authority. Therefore, only regarding the

assault and battery of the Chinese police officer, a public prosecution was filed with the First Special District Local Court. After Judge Dai Rongduo repeatedly investigated and clarified the matter, yesterday morning was the day for the verdict. The detectives escorted the two criminals, Li Pinquan (also known as Li Wu) and Wu Xiufeng, to the Eighth Criminal Court. Police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu and the defendants' defense lawyers also arrived in court one after another. Soon, Judge Dai took the bench and

sentenced Li and Wu to seven months of imprisonment. The defendants' lawyers immediately requested bail during the appeal period, but the court determined that the crimes committed by the two criminals were serious and difficult to approve, rejecting their request. They then ordered the detectives to escort them back to the police station for strict detention, pending final judgment and imprisonment.

The New Life Movement Exhibition is Meaningful: At dusk, with thousands of lights on, it was reported that it was past 6:00 PM. Each member took the cars of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to visit the fifth anniversary exhibition of the New Life Movement. Concrete exhibitions of various aspects of life, such as diet and living, were presented. Various utensils such as kitchens and bathrooms were both hygienic and cost-effective, and were all made in China. There were also simple devices to prevent rats from gnawing on things, which were said to be excellent and wonderful, and could be applied in the inland areas of our country. The method is to add a movable hard board in the middle of the rope for hanging objects. Rats must pass through the hard board to get food, and the hard board moves, and the rat falls to the ground. Also, the food cabinet is nailed to the wall, about half a foot from the wall. The four corners leaning against the wall are made of lead skin into a liter shape to prevent rats from entering the cabinet. This can be called "home economics education" and can also be taught in conjunction with "labor practice."

The exhibition in the last room was "Songgui in the Construction of Economic Fortresses." In addition, the New Life Women's Guidance Committee ran production projects in Songgui Township, Chongqing. The person in charge was the social educator Ms. Yu Qingtang. The items displayed in the room were (1) improved silk industry. It is said that no waste is discarded from a silkworm pupa from beginning to end. It can still be used to make soap and soy sauce; (2) Angora rabbit wool products. A rabbit wool spinning wheel has also been invented, costing only ten foreign dollars per frame, and the villagers can use it within two weeks; (3) mass-produced gauze; (4) improved big oranges. This kind of orange is larger than American oranges; (5) improved orange juice; (6) valuable pig bristles; (7) improved eggs; (8) hemp-made artificial cotton; (9) military blankets woven from cow and sheep wool; (10) velvet ropes; (11) embroidered summer cloth. All of these make use of local products and are used domestically and abroad. Silk and pig bristles have reached export standards. From now on, Sichuan will have a large amount of export goods. According to Ms. Yu, the time is very short, and the foundation is all laid on mass education, so the villagers are willing to participate and run cooperatives and training courses to seek welfare for the people.

Kong and Zhang Host a Simple and Hygienic Feast: After visiting the New Life Movement Exhibition, the members attended a banquet hosted by President Kong Xiangxi and Vice President Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan. The dinner was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 8:00 PM. This kind of banquet was different from usual, because it was a New Life banquet. Each person only had a bowl of soup and a bowl of vegetables. The vegetable bowl was divided into four compartments, containing (1) a slice of fish and an egg, (2) peas and fried meat slices, (3) bamboo shoots braised in meat, (4) vegetables. It was nutritious and hygienic, and the price was only four or five jiao. Compared with the extravagance of the past, the difference cannot be measured by distance.

Chiang's Reply Encourages Education and Resistance: After the meal, fruit was served. During the banquet, the two hosts, Kong and Zhang, gave humorous speeches. Jiang Menglin replied on behalf of all the members, mainly thanking the authorities for allocating funds to maintain education and said that Chinese education in the past has not failed, because today women and children in remote rural areas all know how to sing passionate songs, and the 400 million people in the country are of one mind. Extraordinary education is carried out by aviation schools and military academies, and ordinary education is carried out by us. Extraordinary education must be based on ordinary education. In short, there has never been a magical sudden change in education in the world, and it must come gradually. This meeting will not have any new tricks. Finally, Ma Shouyi performed ten sets of magic tricks, and then the meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM.

### Today's Grand Football Match: Lido vs. Western District Police Fight for the Scott Cup

The showdown is at 2:30 PM at the Recreation Ground. Both sides have their strengths, making the outcome difficult to predict.

The Scott Cup football competition, featuring twelve strong Chinese and Western teams, has reached its final stage. Lido and the Western District Police will compete for the championship today at 2:30 PM at the Recreation Ground. Lido easily defeated Lox and powerfully overcame St. Francis. The Western District Police, on the other hand, consecutively defeated Portugal, the Jewish Association, and Eastern Selle, thus earning the right to the finals. With Zhang Xueyao leaving Shanghai, Lido's internal defense is weakened. They have decided to transfer Sun Jinshun to guard the rear, which should compensate for Zhang Lin'gen's absence. The forwards are talented, so the relocation of Sun will not diminish their sharpness. Western District Police's goalkeeper, Willie Walter, possesses excellent technique, unmatched in Shanghai. Defenders Turner and Victor are steady, and the center line boasts the fierce Huishute and the experienced Jebson. Therefore, in terms of strength, Lido excels in offense over defense, while the Western District Police excels in defense over offense. A fierce battle is expected. Since the cup's inception in 1902, Chinese teams have only won twice, both times by the Shandong Chinese Association. All other times, it has been won by foreign teams. This time, Lido will surely follow in the footsteps of the Donghua Association and win supreme glory for the Chinese people. The Zi Lin Cup final, featuring the French Army versus British American Tobacco, will take place at 3:00 PM at the Racecourse. In the Group A first round, Aurora University faces Eastern Selle, with little chance of success. The schedule for today is listed below:

### "Symbol of Melancholy"

— Mao Lie

Kuwahara Shiroko says that art is a symbol of melancholy; I say that war is also a symbol of melancholy.

An artist has feelings but no way to vent them, suffering from melancholy. He has no choice but to entrust his passion to art. Thus, the pent-up feelings in his chest can be released without reservation, and he can continue to live. As for whether his art will be valued by contemporaries or passed on to future generations, he does not ask. However, such art is often valued by contemporaries and is indeed able to be passed on to future generations.

Similarly, an oppressed people, having already yielded and retreated repeatedly, suffers from unspeakable melancholy. But the oppressor is still insatiable and oppresses endlessly. Thus, they have no other choice but to rise up in resistance and strike back at the oppressors. In the heat of the moment, they may even focus on venting their anger, regardless of the risk of success or failure. However, such wars are often able to win victory, thus shaking off the shackles and achieving independence and freedom.

In the former case, it is what is called "poverty breeds art," and in the latter case, it is of course "adversity builds a nation." There are countless examples of artists who became skilled after experiencing poverty, and nations that were built through adversity can also be pointed out one by one. Recently, our country has encountered oppression from the enemy, and thus the whole country has united. The second phase of the war of resistance has begun, and thus victory has a certain chance of success. These are all clear proofs that adversity builds a nation, and they are also symbols of melancholy, which, like art, have become beautiful fruits for people to appreciate.

However, we know that melancholy is not only seen in artists but also in those who are keen on fame and gain; not only in the oppressed but also in the oppressors. Why is it that artists and the oppressed ultimately achieve something, while those who are keen on fame and gain and the oppressors, if they do not achieve nothing, then they achieve something but are despised by people and scolded by future generations? There is no other reason for this. The former's motivation is pure, peaceful, and in accordance with justice, so they are said to have the support of those who possess the Way. The latter's motivation is base, violent, and contrary to justice, so they are said to have little support from those who lose the Way. Although the melancholy in emotions is the same, the causes and consequences are very different.

Our enemies have the melancholy of the oppressors. The symbol of their melancholy is, of course, war. However, since launching the war, their melancholy has not only failed to be reduced but has instead increased. Now, they can neither advance nor retreat, and they are deeply trapped in the mire. The manifestation of their melancholy can be seen everywhere. Of course, they can absolutely not achieve anything, and being scolded by future generations has already become an ironclad case like a mountain.

Their battles in northern Jiangsu and central Hubei, as well as the indiscriminate bombing and shelling in various places, I once said were boring acts, calling them "reimbursement wars." Now, I can also say that these are their "symbols of melancholy"!

### Crossing the River

— Zhang Zhenshan

In the evening, the night gradually spread out in the sky, shrouding the earth like a layer of black gauze. It was also like dust stirred up by the wind, so vast and pervasive that it obscured the fields and villages and blurred the vast river surface.

The muddy yellow river water, beautified by the twilight, unexpectedly gave us many conveniences from the haze. Crossing the river in a haze, we stepped into the territory occupied by demons. A sudden and urgent hope floated in our minds: drive out the invaders and protect the river!

A team of brothers rushed down the embankment, quickly climbed onto a small boat, untied the cable, and pushed off with a pole. The river water was agitated by the boat, and waves suddenly surged up, one after another, hitting, shaking, splashing, stretching, and shrinking. The surface of the water was like countless wild flowers blooming, swaying back and forth.

The small boats, connected to each other, left the embankment and advanced towards the center of the river. All the jungles and thatched huts were shrinking, and the footprints sloping on the soft mud beside the river appeared as many vague black spots.

The twilight gradually deepened, swallowing the only remaining ray of light. Standing at the bow of the boat, it was impossible to distinguish between the sky and the water or to see clearly the distance. We could only infer the distance between the boat and the shore from the sound of the waves rubbing against the hull and determine the direction of progress from the whistling of the river wind.

The night wind on the river was getting stronger and stronger, sweeping across our boat in gusts, stirring up continuous waves and making our boat shake more violently. The bow and stern pitched and rolled, hitting the river water and making gurgling sounds.

"The night wind on the river is so strong. It can really be considered a great help!" two brothers suddenly laughed.

"Haha! The stronger the wind, the more energetic we become. The darker the sky, the more convenient we become. Wasn't the battle at Jilin River also fought in this kind of weather and at this time, annihilating six hundred Japanese devils? Today is the same weather and time, hahaha!..." The old strongman steering the boat at the stern also laughed and spoke.

"Old Strong! Just hearing you say that makes my hands itch again. I've been resting in the rear for three weeks, so I haven't heard the miserable cries of the enemy for three weeks. I can't wait to jump across the river..."

"Paddle, faster! Almost near the shore. Don't worry, a rich harvest is right in front of us!" Their conversation stopped, and in the silence, they worked hard to paddle forward, quickly approaching the north bank of the river.

The impact of the boat and the water gradually subsided. Although the night was deep, we could still see a long line of shoreline in the darkness. Joy, hope, happiness, and determination suddenly filled everyone's hearts. Tense emotions roused even greater courage. Dozens of boats, like fighting for a prize, approached the breach in the river bank.

"Wh——Hiss——" The captain blew a sharp whistle, and a team of brothers quickly climbed the river bank.

Advance! Attack! Sparks burst in the air, and flames burned in the grass. The sky, the hillside, and the fields were immediately scattered with many red stars. The devil's camp near the river bank also seemed to be mobilized. Bullets and shells flew like shooting stars, crisscrossing and covering the dark sky. A team of brothers who had crossed the river advanced bravely, spreading their legs and braving the enemy's artillery fire!

### The Hand of Memory

— Liu You

I can't hear anything, I can't think of anything, and the present is a vast expanse. I can only sit quietly, close my eyes, and a smile emerges for no reason at the corner of my mouth.

At this moment, the hand of memory stretches out! It flies! It flies far and high.

Ah! It is flying, flying on the road I have come. It flies quickly, searching for my past deeds, and begins to seize them!

Yesterday's bitterness and past joy are seized by it!

Past sins and former glories are also seized by it!

Seized! Everything is seized!

But it flies forward, higher and farther, and catches my childhood!

——Living in the old house in my hometown, playing on the land of my hometown.

——An ignorant baby, crying in his mother's arms.

Suddenly, it flies back, and it presents to me what it has seized, without leaving anything behind.

I accept it gratefully! I love its gifts, and I praise its merits.

I was admiring its gifts when I suddenly found infinite sorrow.

I am like a lost traveler in the deep mountains, hesitating and wandering.

I can't find anything anymore, and I haven't gained anything.

I know that what it has given me is the "emptiness" it has seized!

### If Medicine is Ineffective, Why Not Pull it Out!

— Shifang

### Random Thoughts on "Curiosity"

— Sophia

"Curiosity,"—just like someone who has never been to Shanghai is surprised by the prosperity of Shanghai and becomes intoxicated by it.—Although it may seem a bit "rustic" in the eyes of "gentlemen," it is, in terms of human desires, a manifestation of a "pursuing" heart.

For example, when the Lunar New Year arrives, there are people selling beauty paintings for the month on the side of the road. On a quiet empty wall, they hammer in a few nails, string up a rope, and then hang up portraits of famous people or Western paintings, such as photos of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman Lin Sen, and then nude beauties, as well as brightly colored and lively "scenery paintings" with airplanes and airships above, warships and battleships below, and cars in the middle. There are the Bund of Shanghai's main road, as well as something from America, something from France, and so on. Although the upper classes who have been there or are afraid of being embarrassed are naturally not happy to go to the crowd to see it clearly, there is another group of people who are very interested in discussing it, staring intently at the American bridge, like a child listening to fairy tales.

This is what people know, they haven't seen it, it's "curiosity."

Naturally, after "curiosity," comes the desire to see it in person, but their "good fortune" is limited to this. They don't have the "good fortune" to go to America, and even going to the cinema is considered extravagant. They have no choice but to "appease their hunger with a painting of a cake" on this cold street. At most, if they can't bear to part with it, they might generously buy it back to decorate their home for the New Year.

The actions of people who generously buy one to take home may be laughed at by the general public as "rustic," but the more determined they are to buy it back, the more fiercely they pursue new things. This pursuit is not shameful. This act of "curiosity" is proof of the person's heart, extremely hoping for a new future.

"Appeasing hunger with a painting of a cake" may be boring and useless, but at least it is yearning for this "cake" to be truly edible!

This kind of "curiosity" situation is probably most prevalent in China; and these kinds of paintings sell far better in the countryside than in the cities. Although the Chinese people claim to be conservative, because the countryside still has such a desire for all things new, the Chinese people are not conservative; conversely, if these new things are truly suitable for human needs, then the conservatives will not oppose them either. People ultimately know what is good and bad. If airplanes can bomb civilians, then it is better to "be conservative" and say, "Let's not have these things."

China has been made to lag behind the world's rate of progress due to natural disasters and man-made calamities. Watching new things being invented in other people's homes one by one, what they feel is only "curiosity." This manifestation of people's desire for progress is extremely tragic. I hope that in this national reform, they will no longer look at the "painting of a cake" on the wall and drool.

Let them also taste a real cake!

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

"This place is very close to Hepu Town, and the × army might come here to search in the dark of night. Everyone must pay extra attention, be vigilant at all times, keep your guns by your side, and never take off your clothes."

Although she exhorted them in this way, everyone had been working hard all day, and at this moment they had all fallen asleep soundly. Even the head of the military medical department was no exception, and some people even let out loud snores. Only Fang Hui dared not fall asleep. She opened her eyes, gazing into the darkness, and listening intently to the sounds outside.

In the middle of the night, there was suddenly a rapid burst of barking from outside, followed by barking from two or three other places. Fang Hui was just about to fall asleep when she heard this sound. Her drowsiness disappeared completely, and she quickly jumped up and pressed her ear to the mud floor to listen carefully. In addition to the barking of dogs, there was also the faint sound of leather boots, and it sounded like a dog had been kicked and was letting out a miserable whimper. She quietly opened a crack in the door and saw the light of a flashlight flickering outside. Several dark figures were wriggling behind the light, and suddenly the light shone directly at her, and her entire body was exposed without any cover in the light. Three ferocious × soldiers walked towards her. The one in front held a Mauser pistol, and the two behind him held Arisaka rifles level, in a aiming position.

This was a very critical and tense situation. Fang Hui had no weapons by her side, and there was no time to turn back and get them. If her body moved, the bullets could immediately hit her. She knew that the current situation did not allow her to evade. Relying on her usual outstanding courage, she simply stood motionless in front of them, watching what they would do.

The three × soldiers stopped about five yards away from Fang Hui. The one in front holding the Mauser pistol actually spoke Chinese, speaking fluent Shanghai dialect. He grinned lewdly and called out to Fang Hui:

"Hey! Miss."

"What do you want?" Fang Hui, fearing that she would reveal her secret, pretended to be terrified.

"Miss, I'll show you something good." As he spoke, the × soldier reached into his arms and took out a photo. Using the light of the flashlight, he waved it at Fang Hui and said proudly, "This is my wife, Chiyoko. Do you think she's beautiful? Pretty?"

Fang Hui actually hadn't seen it clearly, but she deliberately praised without reservation:

"She is indeed very beautiful and very pretty! Why don't you stay at home with such a beautiful and pretty wife, living a happy and blissful life? Instead, you abandoned her and ran all the way to our China?"

"There's no way!" The × soldier seemed to be moved by Fang Hui's words, and his expression was filled with emotion as he spoke.

Fang Hui deliberately asked again:

"Now that you've run here, what do you intend to do?"

The × soldier returned to his original lewd and shameless look, took a step closer, and said: (36)

Spring and Autumn

### Talking About International Gambling

— Fo

Czechoslovakia is gone! The German army has marched into the capital of Czechoslovakia in a mighty force. President Hácha, like a sheep, has presented a "surrender" to Hitler. This son nurtured by the democratic nations has died young, and I don't know what his feelings are. Some say that the Munich Agreement was barely dry, and Mr. Hitler's face has already changed. He is getting an inch and wanting a mile, and he is too unkind. In fact, this situation was entirely created by Mr. Chamberlain single-handedly. The demise of Czechoslovakia is not the last act, and the real good show is yet to come.

I don't understand national strategies or the international situation. I only know how to play mahjong. In playing mahjong, there is only good luck and bad luck. If you play the wrong tile, the hand will go down, or you挺 three, six, nine of Bamboo or one, four, seven of Wan but do not win, but are intercepted by a 挺 edge or embedded tile, this kind of bad luck is really touching India. Mr. Chamberlain should have "碰" the Sudetenland tile but did not, and Hitler was allowed to eat an embedded tile, and then won three times in a row. How comfortable! There must be East after three consecutive wins, and maybe he will win a hand of three-台辣子, who knows. It is really just one wrong move, and the whole game is defeated.

Westerners don't play much mahjong but are good at playing poker. The other day, the chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Wadman, said to the press, "Hitler is a 'national player' in playing poker with European countries. The cards in the hands of each country are better than those held by Germany, but they are still defeated by Germany." These words are indeed correct. On the other hand, the countries of the democratic front are too cumbersome in their poker skills. Assuming that Hitler cheats, you must look and see. Hitler will definitely fail. Now, Hitler's first cheating victory has given him a large capital and a strong courage. For the second cheating victory, others will not dare to look. The second cheating victory is followed by the third and fourth cheating victories, and others will be even more afraid to look. Thus, Hitler becomes an invincible "poker master."

Four people play cards, and two people suffer from the plague. Hitler and Mussolini are still carrying the sedan chair. I release a 中風 to you, and you release a 白板 to me. You want to win three 番, and I want to win 清一色, which makes the other two families stare blankly, unable to arrange. Although Mr. Chamberlain feels that he has played the wrong cards, the situation is getting worse and worse, and the capital is getting smaller and smaller. It is already impossible to save. Although condemning Hitler for disrupting the overall situation is in vain, many chips have already been taken away by Mr. Hitler. Germany and Italy call themselves the axis of Europe, one developing on land and the other thinking about water. One supports and one sings, causing all countries to be busy and unable to cope. Isn't this the same as carrying a sedan chair while playing cards? In the current situation, if the countries of the peaceful front do not wake up and are unwilling to unite thoroughly, it is the so-called "A Yuan wearing a hat, it must be over."

### Concerning Hebei Fourth Cun Middle School

— Tingmei

On the 13th, various newspapers in this port published the news of the Fourth Cun Middle School in Hebei engaging in a desperate battle with the Japanese army in prominent positions. Because of this heroic deed, the unfamiliar name of Fourth Cun Middle School was deeply imprinted on people's minds. I once taught at Fourth Cun Middle School. To strengthen our resistance, I will write a bit about the history of Fourth Cun Middle School so that everyone knows that this heroic deed was not accidental. At the same time, it can also prove the great responsibility that education has to the country and society.

Fourth Cun Middle School was previously just a small rural elementary school in Boye, consisting of several adobe houses surrounded by a fence. Later, it was expanded with investment from the local gentleman Zhang Yinwu, and then it was renamed. From an elementary school to a middle school, by the time the July 7th Incident broke out, the school buildings were connected in a row, and there were nearly a thousand students!

The name Fourth Cun originates from the Yan-Li School of Qing Confucianism. In my childhood, my grandfather used to smoke his pipe, bask in the sun, and tell me the story of Yan Xizhai. He said: Yan Xizhai was a great Confucian of this county. His family was extremely poor. When he was three years old, his father was taken away by Tatar soldiers – referring to the Manchurian soldiers – and his mother remarried. He begged for leftover food and soup in the neighbor's house, and sometimes helped people weed in the fields. When he was in his twenties, he learned that his father had been taken away by Tatar soldiers, so he was determined to go beyond the border to find his father. But it happened to be a time of war and chaos, year after year, so it was not until he was in his fifties that he went beyond the border. After years of hardship and suffering, he finally carried his father's bones back and buried them in the ancestral graveyard.

In terms of academic studies, Yan Xizhai countered the empty and superficial practices of Song Confucianism and vigorously advocated practical learning. He said: "People's years and energy are limited. Spending a day reciting texts is like losing a day practicing; adding a point to paper and ink is like subtracting a point from one's own life." Therefore, he wrote very few books. The ones that people often talk about today are only the four essays: "Cun Xue" (Preserving Learning), "Cun Zhi" (Preserving Governance), "Cun Ren" (Preserving Humanity), and "Cun Xing" (Preserving Nature).

The name Fourth Cun Middle School is obviously based on this. Since it respects Yan's learning, the school's spirit is simple, steadfast, and diligent in practice, which outsiders cannot possibly imagine even a fraction of. Zhang Yinwu deeply felt that modern youth are frivolous, conceited, and ashamed to return to the countryside, so he advocated Fourth Cun to rectify these shortcomings. All the teachers and principals in the school engaged in education with a spirit of sacrifice; their lofty aspirations and pure conduct made them role models for young people. The students not only had military training courses; their daily lives were all disciplined and militarized. The uniform was made of coarse cloth, brown in summer and black in winter, with leggings and belts. They always considered themselves the pillars of the nation.

Although I left Fourth Cun nine years ago, the situation at that time is still like yesterday. The sound of the bugle marked the beginning of the day's work, and the sound of the bugle sent the whole school to dreamland when the night was quiet. Our lives were constantly under tension. Burying ourselves in research in the library turned us into bookworms; watering and fertilizing in the fields was no different from farmers; and when we went to the fields, we rode horses and tried our swords, looking like warriors who would capture generals and seize flags.

At this critical moment of the War of Resistance, the teachers and students of the school put what they had learned into practice based on their consistent spirit of physical exertion, and dedicated it to the country with sincere enthusiasm. I still remember the most popular song in the school, which had these words: "...Good men's heads are upright, good men's lives are light, good men die on the battlefield to receive fame..." Now the teachers and students of the school have died on the battlefield, though not for any fame before or after death!

Scene Twelve (Continued)

(Young Man) C... can I say it? (Man) It doesn't matter, take your time! (Young Man) Then I ask for your forgiveness, Your Honor! (Sings) Before I speak, tears flow uncontrollably; Matters of the heart, I will tell Your Honor in detail. He Chengxin is a false name, pure fiction; I am originally from Jianzhou, Fan Shizhou of the Fan family. I only hate that Fan Ruwei, the bandit chief, is the source of trouble; He kills officials and soldiers, deceives good people, and occupies Jianzhou. I advised him to surrender to the Song Dynasty, but he ignored it; I advised the soldiers with righteousness to cooperate on the same boat. When the Han army came, I escaped with my confidants; In Yue's camp, I made meritorious service, ascending the city tower at night. Breaking Luzhou, I was the first to contribute, the marshal was very kind; Protecting the young general, I was promoted to envoy, rewarding my efforts. This matter has not been revealed for eight years; Your Honor asks, I can only tell the details. (Man) So it seems, you are a national hero, I have been disrespectful: (Young Man) I am ashamed, ashamed! (Man) Did your wife get married before or after being with the bandits? (Woman secretly enters and eavesdrops) (Young Man) Your Honor! (Sings) Among the bandits, I happened to meet a daughter of an official family; Because of shared aspirations and common interests, we became husband and wife. When the Han army arrived, we agreed that the husband would not remarry; The wife would not remarry, always remembering each other, our fates forever intertwined. Now, it has been eight years, with no news for a long time; I think my wife has passed away, how lonely I am! (Woman secretly wipes tears) (Man) When the envoy met your first wife, what was the token? (Young Man sings) The ancestral heirloom, the mandarin duck mirror, is divided as a token, When separated, they are two halves, but when combined, they become one. (Man) Is this mirror still with you? (Young Man sings) I think my wife, she is my lifelong confidante, The mandarin duck mirror, I carry it with me, never leaving it day or night. (Woman secretly nods) (Man) Please let me see it. (Young Man opens his robe, unties the embroidered belt on his brocade bellyband, takes out the treasure mirror hidden inside, and presents it) Please take a look, Your Honor. (Man) What a treasure! I also have a mandarin duck treasure mirror. (Young Man laughs) You are joking! This humble general knows that this is the same as urgent military intelligence. (And secretly laughs) (Man) Indeed a treasure. (Young Man) If you have a treasure, please show it, Your Honor! (Man takes out a mirror) Look, look, look, isn't this it? (Young Man is shocked) Ah!… (Sings) Your Honor also has a mandarin duck mirror, Everything is unclear, like clouds and mist. (Man) Look, the two sides combine to become one! Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha ha ha ha! (Young Man) Where did Your Honor get this treasure mirror? (Before the Man can answer, the Young Man cries and rushes out to meet him) (Woman) Ah ya, my husband! (Pulls the Young Man's sleeve) (Young Man is startled and retreats, trembling) Who are you, pulling and tugging like this? (Woman) I am your wife Feng Yumei, how can you not recognize me, husband? (Young Man still trembling) H... h... how can this be? When the Han army arrived, my wife she... she... had already committed suicide! (Woman) I did jump into the well, but I was rescued by my father! (Man) Envoy, don't be afraid, this is my daughter, who is also your wife! (Young Man) Wife, ah ya ya, my wife! Am I dreaming? Let me bite my finger. (It hurts) Ouch, this is real, ah ha ha ha ha! Father-in-law, I, your son-in-law, kowtow to you. (Man helps him up) Enough! Let us return to the back hall to make up for the celebration banquet, and also celebrate the reunion banquet. (Young Man) I am ashamed, ashamed! Truly, a broken mirror is reunited, like a dream, (Man) My daughter has keen eyes and recognizes a hero. In the back hall, we will make up for the feast for moving the capital, (Woman) You performed a great service in breaking Luzhou in the dark of night. (Man, Young Man, Woman) Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha ha ha ha! (Music plays as they exit together) —The End—

### Impressions of "Boys Town"

— Bai Hua

In Omaha, Nebraska, USA, there is a unique small city, the quietest and most meaningful corner of the world, where a very bright and clean little government is successfully run by children. It has 275 citizens, the oldest being 18 and the youngest only six. Two hundred are boys, and seventy-five are girls. - That little city is Boys Town, an orphanage that Father Flanagan has painstakingly managed for twenty-one years. (See Asian Film News)

"Boys Town" describes the history of Father Flanagan's fight for those orphaned and helpless children. Spencer Tracy, who won the Academy Award last year, plays Father Flanagan, and Mickey Rooney, who co-starred with Spencer Tracy in "Captains Courageous," plays Whitey, who is "in league with bandits, fierce and stubborn." Due to the collaboration of these two excellent actors and the superb artistic skills of director Norman Taurog, the content and form of "Boys Town" have reached the pinnacle of art.

Now, I will briefly describe the various aspects as follows:

(1) Actors: Spencer Tracy as Father Flanagan - From listening to the confession of a condemned prisoner in jail, he was determined to take on the responsibility of educating children. He solicited donations from all parties, took in children, built houses, influenced Whitey, was criticized by society, and finally the truth came out, and his career was successful. Spencer Tracy was able to reveal a spirit of hardship and perseverance from his calm facial expressions. The scenes of influencing Whitey and Pee Wee were particularly profound and moving. Mickey Rooney as Whitey - He not only portrayed a stubborn and indifferent bad boy to the fullest extent (e.g., when he first met Father Flanagan, he deliberately held a cigarette in his mouth and crossed his legs, vividly showing the appearance of a hooligan child; when he led the tour of the various workshops after entering the orphanage, he was also impetuous and indifferent), but also when Pee Wee was run over by a car, his pure conscience was discovered. After listening to the prayers of all the children in the orphanage, he wandered aimlessly in the streets, and finally, when he was elected mayor of the orphanage, the emotion of wanting to cry but having no tears, and finally throwing himself into the Father's arms, can be said to be "touching the heart and spleen", sweeping away his past misdeeds from the audience's minds, and making them feel his innocence and loveliness instead. "There is no such thing as a bad boy in the world," his acting more powerfully proved Father Flanagan's belief. Bobs Watson, who played Pee Wee, is also a rare child star.

(2) Director: Norman Taurog's skillful technique also proves that "integrating education with entertainment" is not just a slogan. Although "Boys Town" is also a historical film, it does not indulge in unnecessary horizontal development. It tightly grasps the main thread, eliminates the dross, and develops consistently, and it is lively and natural. For example, the insertion of David and the loan scene is too cute. A steel watch and a toy are used as collateral for one hundred dollars. However, after the Father says that every child will become a good citizen in the future, the problem is solved. The director further demonstrated his courage in grasping the emotions and atmosphere of the entire film. For example, at the beginning, the scene where Father Flanagan meets the condemned prisoner, the close-ups of several prisoners and Father Flanagan are very powerful. Even more lovable is Whitey's determination to escape, Pee Wee's insistence on going with him, all the way to the scene where the bandits rob the bank. From the light mood to the abyss of sorrow, and then jumping up to unfold the tense scene, the director tightly pulls the audience's heart, almost making people breathless. The conciseness of other screenwriting is, of course, secondary.

After watching "Boys Town," I was really moved. "There is no such thing as a bad boy in the world," but in every corner of the world, the pure conscience of children is being eroded, causing them to fall into irredeemable environments. Therefore, it is felt that work like "Boys Town" is very urgent. Now, people in Shanghai who care about children's welfare are paying attention to this work, and that is the "Shanghai Children's Welfare Association." A feature article was published in this magazine last week. After more than a year of efforts, they have established a very solid foundation. It is hoped that the staff of the association will work harder, and it is hoped that all sectors of society can provide material and spiritual assistance so that it can be expanded to all of China and the world, "so that every child can become a good citizen in the future."

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Chapter Six: Praising the Longevity of One Sprout and Three Blossoms; Narrating the Friendship of Two Scholars Meeting Heroes

He Liyu said: "Really! When we got off the train, at the station, we saw someone who looked like a police officer. He even raised his hand to salute you. After that, we went from the station to Shih Lake, and then from Shih Lake we sent Sister Junsu to Soochow University, and then we set off from Soochow University. We didn't see a single policeman along the way." Zhu Airen said: "The policeman we saw at the station just now was named Fang. He is specially assigned to the station. Every time a train arrives, he has to remember any special guests or foreigners who come to Suzhou for sightseeing, and some even have to report to his superiors. Speaking of that policeman named Fang, there is also a special anecdote, and it would be even more interesting to tell you." He Shuangyu said: "What exactly is the anecdote? Why is it even more interesting to tell us?" Zhu Airen laughed: "Let me tell you slowly! I am driving, don't rush me! It turns out that the policeman Fang is also a local. The place where he lives is only two or three li away from our hospital. His wife was pregnant and had registered at our hospital in advance and had her body checked. She was preparing to stay in the hospital when she was about to give birth. But when the time for delivery had passed, she still didn't give birth, and her belly was particularly large. It was even difficult for her to walk, so we took her to the hospital in a car. Everyone studied her case, and my adoptive mother, the old doctor Zhang, said that it must be twins. Because her belly was too big, and it was her first birth, we had to be very careful. The old doctor Zhang ordered me to personally deliver the baby. At this time, the policeman Fang heard that she was going to have a difficult labor, and he was extremely anxious, because they were a very loving couple. It wasn't until ten months and a week that she finally gave birth, and it was indeed a difficult labor. Fortunately, we had all prepared in advance, so there were no mistakes. When she gave birth, just as the old doctor Zhang had expected, she gave birth to one, and then another. We thought it was twins, but who knew there was still one inside after giving birth to two. She gave birth to three in a row. And all three of them were boys. For a time, the two midwives and the nurse were in a flurry. Because we had only prepared for twins, we hadn't prepared for triplets. Fortunately, there were many people in our hospital, and even the old doctor Zhang came to help. At that time, not only the whole hospital was in an uproar, but the whole town was also in an uproar. The old doctor Zhang said: 'We often have twins in our hospital, which is not surprising. But triplets are rare, so we have to take good care of them. We have to take care of the mother and the babies with all our heart.'" (63)

The Entertainment World

### Remembering Xia Yueshan's Patriotic Thoughts

— Sun Xueni

I have a strong passion for drama, and I especially enjoy traveling to famous mountains. Whether in Wu, Yue, Lu, Yan, Wan, E, Min, Yue, or Japan and Southeast Asia, I always take the local drama as the guiding principle for entering the country and asking about customs. Although I don't fully understand it, it is enough to comprehend it with my heart. Drama can represent the cultural spirit of a place and is full of artistic interest. Its power to transform customs is no less than that of religious propaganda. Twenty years ago, when I was in charge of Chunliu, I first met Xue Shouling. Shouling was the literary son of Lord Yaoqing. At that time, the New Stage had moved to the Nine-Mu Plot. After a long time of acquaintance, I met Xia Yueshan. Observing his demeanor, he did not resemble someone from the performing arts world. Listening to his words, he was indeed worthy of respect. Therefore, I recalled and recorded it. (1) He had national thoughts. Xia was rich in patriotic thoughts. The New Stage moved from the Sixteenth Bund to the Nine-Mu Plot, entirely to revitalize the Chinese business district. The Nine-Mu Plot originally had a small population. Since the Kaiming Company built the stage, shops, and Kaiming Lane, the number of residents increased daily, and the city appearance changed dramatically. At that time, it was still considered insufficient, and there was a plan for the East Asia Grand Theater, with a budget of 1.2 million yuan. An engineer was hired to design it. The surrounding gardens and rockeries were beautiful, and the structure of the stage was unique. The area was huge, enough to accommodate the background. The seats were wide and comfortable, and the sight lines and lighting were rationalized everywhere. Because the surrounding gardens could isolate sound waves from the outside world, the conception was undoubtedly novel. Unfortunately, Xia died early and did not achieve his ambition. Even with the play "New Camellia," it was full of national defense meaning. His hard work in promoting drama aroused the audience's patriotic interest, which is certainly not to be criticized.

(2) He had social significance. Looking at Xia's life as a whole, such as the Performing Arts Association, which raised the personality of actors, the Fire Brigade, which was related to public welfare, the Zhenling School and the Qing'e Sports Association, which were aimed at education, all were beneficial to society, not just artistic abilities. The play "Black Register of Wrongs" once caused a sensation, and his earnestness was admirable. There were often people who were jealous of him. When the play was being performed, two bombs were thrown, but he did not stop the performance. His indomitable spirit was truly rare.

(3) He had a revolutionary stance. "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" and "Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong" were all plays written and directed by Xia, depicting the tragic pain of national subjugation, which had the same subtle effect as the tragic national subjugation of Poland. During the Sixteen Bund era of the New Stage, there were often revolutionary martyrs in the manager's office. At the end of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, he once wrote to the Prince Regent, recounting that actors should be treated equally and should not be classified as prostitutes. His reasoning was righteous, and his loud cry was truly commendable.

(4) He had moral concepts. Xia himself was frugal, but he treated others generously. Although the "Living Buddha Jigong" was a myth, it was nothing more than an exhortation to goodness and a sharp criticism of the world. He had the skill of depicting the spirit of the subject. Unfortunately, no one succeeded him, and it became a swan song. The entire play "Heavenly Retribution" was admired by Lao Tan, and the mediocrity of the rest need not be mentioned. The test of "Heavenly Retribution" also contained the meaning of encouraging good and punishing evil, the so-called "Sheng Gong's preaching, stubborn stones nod," and other old plays, such as "Yin Yang River," "Meilong Town," "Yellow Crane Tower," "Dumu Pass," etc., also had unique features. As for the improved new drama, it was a transitional era and often had the danger of being incompatible. One cannot be blamed for being neither donkey nor horse, nor for forgetting one's ancestors. In short, Xia not only contributed to drama but also to society, and his influence on the country was profound. It is only a pity that his son, Xiaoshan, engaged in electricity, studied in Europe, and after returning to China, he could not continue his father's business, promote his great ideas, and complete his unfinished ambitions!

### Playwright Lu Xiaoting Reports: Inland Theater Industry Union Established in Guilin

— Haisheng

Playwright Lu Xiaoting wrote a "Lin Chong" at the Tianchan Stage last year. His writing style could not cater to the tastes of the audience in the isolated island. With the scars of failure, he left Shanghai for Guilin, and later went to Liuzhou. When the Weixin Theater Troupe, funded by the Liuzhou County Party Department, was established, he joined the service, and he found a more meaningful outlet.

Yesterday, I received a letter from him from Guiyang, reporting an important news in the theater industry, that is, the Guilin Opera and Ping Opera groups in Guilin have organized and established an "Inland Theater Industry Union," with no less than 500 comrades joining. It is guided by Mr. Ma Yanxiang of the Political Department of the Guilin Camp, and Feng Yukun is the chairman. He is also one of the cadres. Recently, he wrote a "New Yue Fei," which has been submitted to the Political Department for review.

At the end of the letter, he said a few extremely excited words: Tian Han has sent a telegram to encourage us, not to disappoint us for our hard work in the mainland. You wait for our good news. In the near future, we will change to a new battle line.

### Anecdotes of Actresses

— Henei Maiden

The leading actress Zhang Eyun, since coming to Shanghai, has had an excellent reputation. When she has no shows at home, she does not wear makeup and often wears a long black robe with a monk's collar, which is very elegant.

The rising star Wang Xichun gets up early to practice her voice very diligently. Every day when she goes to Carter Road, she must enter and exit a flower shop because her residence is also on the upper floor of the International Photo Studio.

The pillar of the Xinxin Grand Jing Troupe, Dong Mingyan, is skilled in both civil and military arts and is famous far and wide. Recently, she has been studying at the Chinese Vocational School on Avenue Edward every morning, resembling a female student.

Mei Lanfang's disciple Mao Jianqiu will soon take a large number of stage photos to give to relatives and friends. When she meets familiar girlfriends backstage, she becomes very physical and seems to be making a ruckus.

One of the four famous female lead actresses in the South, Zhang Wenqin, has recently retired and is temporarily not joining any troupe. Besides writing a page of small regular script every day, her hands are constantly knitting wool sweaters.

The progressive actress Jin Suwen often goes to Avenue Joffre alone early in the morning to breathe fresh air. After returning, she reads a novel before eating and going to the courtyard.

The golden-voiced Yun Yanxia has exquisite artistic skills. She has been working hard day and night during the New Year, and her body is very weak. As soon as she finishes a show, she goes home to rest.

A Snapshot of the Dance World
— Xiaotian

### Dragon Heads and Trailers

Newcomers to the dance hall, upon hearing the terms "dragon head" and "trailer," cannot help but be astonished. Since it's neither a railway nor a station, where do these dragon heads and trailers come from? It turns out that "dragon head" refers to a dancing girl, but not every dancing girl is called that. "Dragon head" and "trailer" are relative terms. Once a "trailer" is attached, she's called a "dragon head." Without a "trailer," wouldn't she just be a bare dragon head? Then she wouldn't be called a "dragon head."

So, what exactly is a "trailer"? Those in the know say that when a dancing girl and a dance partner hit it off, from the dance partner's perspective, it's called "catching a dragon head." This dance partner then becomes the "trailer." A dance partner with the qualification of being a "trailer" is in for big trouble because the dancing girl doesn't have a lifetime contract with any particular dance hall. Moreover, tea dances, night dances, and lunch dances are mostly not held at the same venue. Therefore, any dance partner who hits it off with a dancing girl seems to be legally obligated to support her wherever she goes. If the dancing girl is working at the East family's place today, the dance partner has to follow her to the East family's place to show support. If she's working at the West family's place tomorrow, he has to follow her there. In this way, the dancing girl is like the locomotive on a train, and the dance partner naturally becomes a trailer attached to the locomotive.

There's also a very subtle explanation. The more powerful the locomotive of a train, the more trailers it can pull. The more magical the "dragon head" dancing girl, the more trailers she can attach. If a "dragon head" can attach dozens of "trailers," dance tickets will flow in endlessly. Her status will then be like that of a celebrated actor in the dance hall world. Big and small dance halls will compete to hire her, and staff and servants will attend to her every need. See how impressive that is?

Furthermore, one "dragon head" can simultaneously pull dozens of "trailers," but one "trailer" cannot simultaneously connect to dozens of "dragon heads." This is also quite similar to the actual situation with trains. You might say that being a "trailer" is a raw deal, but if you think about it carefully, the "dragon head" was also born to parents and has a clean reputation. Isn't that also a raw deal?

Speaking of "trailers," there are also many different categories. However, these categories are somewhat far-fetched. Generally speaking, young masters and sons of wealthy families, impeccably dressed in Western suits, with brand new cars, have a group of hangers-on who constantly flatter them. As for cash and dance tickets, they can get whatever they want without asking. It goes without saying. Getting attached to this kind of "trailer" is both prestigious and profitable, so it's called a "blue steel car." This is considered an honor among their peers. Then there are wealthy merchants and tycoons, who, although advanced in age, are still quite generous and not too difficult to deal with. They also handle errands like driving and buying clothes well. This is a first- or second-class car. If it's a young clerk from a trading company, buying tickets for only three or five yuan, they pay on the spot. But if it's a country bumpkin who tries to get out of paying and insists on clinging to her every day, it's like chicken ribs – tasteless to eat but a pity to throw away. Then, depending on how much money they spend, they are classified as third- or fourth-class cars. There's also a type of university student who is young and wears a sharp suit, which seem to be two advantages, but they have little money and a bad temper, which seem to be two disadvantages. If they start talking about true love, it's truly unbearable. This type of customer can only be used occasionally and can't be relied upon for a living. They're called rickshaws. There's also a kind of tough guy who has money and power and dares to bring another acquaintance to the "dragon head's" location. The "dragon head" doesn't even dare to swallow her anger and has to deal with him and make small talk. This is called an armored car. Then there's a type of person who doesn't spend too much money, doesn't have a big presence, and whose attitude and behavior can be considered pretty good, and whose temperament and temper can be considered gentle. They're neither cold nor hot, like a bowl of lukewarm water, so they're called a horse-drawn carriage, probably because they're neither fast nor slow. The worst kind is called a manure truck because if you're attached to this kind of car, you have to keep it absolutely secret. If you publicize it, you'll be notorious, and no more customers will come to patronize you. If you go home with them, they can't support you. It's truly like a mute eating Coptis chinensis, an unspeakable suffering. However, there aren't absolutely no manure trucks in the dance hall world. Presumably, there are other benefits. I'm just repeating what I've heard and writing nonsense for a while.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and the Pear Garden in the Old Capital (123)

— Xu Muyun

Zhuge Liang Brought to Trial Li Qi When He Executed Ma Su

The play "The Trial of Li Qi" was formerly Huang Runfu's signature piece. Later, Hao Shouchen also became famous for this play. Whenever people in Shanghai mentioned Hao Shouchen, they would always call him Li Qi Changting, meaning the first part is the trial of Li Qi's crimes, and the second part, Changting, focuses on Wang Liang's plea for mercy. This play also has another name, "Using Shackles." The actor performing this play must first imitate the actions and speech of a notorious bandit before he can talk about the singing, acting, reciting, and speaking parts. Shouchen claimed to be a successor of Huang San, so his performance also had many merits. After he returned to Beijing upon completing his term [in Shanghai], the people of Shanghai praised his performance, and some even said that in the net role, other than Hao Shouchen, there was no one else, north or south, who could sing this play. These words happened to reach Jin Shaoshan's ears. He immediately became angry and ordered a costume shop to make a criminal's outfit for him (a red jacket and pants, or sometimes a red silk single layer outfit). He ordered a set of shackles, and once everything was ready, he practiced the play and chose a good date to officially perform it at the Great Stage. Because he wanted to compete with Shouchen for a day's glory, he put in an extraordinary effort during the performance, and many people actually came to support him. Some said he was indeed better than Shouchen, while others said he was not as skilled as Shouchen. I have seen both of them perform this play, and they each had their own strengths, without clear superiority. However, other than these two, I haven't seen any other net roles currently performing it. The above discussion is about the play "The Trial of Li Qi," which is completely different from the "Trial of Li Qi" described below. In the past, there was a painted face actor in Beijing opera troupes named Li Shoushan. He was extremely tall, so his colleagues gave him a nickname, "Big Li Qi." Later, because the four characters were difficult to call, it was simplified to Big Li Qi. People who didn't know the details thought he was a brother of Big Li Wu (Li Shunting), but that was completely wrong. He was originally related to Li Xinfu (Li Ku), which had nothing to do with Big Li Wu. Xinfu performed strictly according to the rules and was very talented. Although he never became a major star, he often followed Old Tan and others as a supporting actor. However, connoisseurs greatly appreciated him. As for his precious brother, Big Li Qi, he was completely different from him. He wanted to sing every role – male, female, net, and clown. I once saw him paired with Lanfang in "The Odd Couple," playing Li Qi (male), and paired with Shang Xiaoyun in "The Kite Misunderstanding," playing the ugly maid (彩旦). He played Cao Cao in "Battle of Wancheng" (淨) with Xiaolou. The most laughable thing was that Li Qi also often liked to perform "The Trial of Li Qi," and he was indeed praised by the audience. His ugly maid in "The Kite Misunderstanding" was also called one of his masterpieces. There is a Jia Duocai today who, when paired with Xiaoyun as the ugly maid, imitates Li Qi's style and receives enthusiastic applause from the audience. So, although Li Qi was a net role, he was famous for the彩旦 role after his death. This can be considered a rare thing.

### Finance: Large Investors Sell Off, Cash Slump Intensifies, Lowest Plunges to 2076 Yuan

Yesterday, the black market situation for spot silver saw a gradually expanding range of fluctuations, with a daily difference of fifteen yuan. The situation initially experienced a sharp drop, followed by a rebound. This was initially due to the Qian-Dui banks leaning towards helping customers offload their holdings, coupled with the potential weakness of the US dollar. Additionally, bullion dealers shifted from selling to buying, leading to a reactive rise. Ultimately, the price fell by twelve yuan. Trading volume was similar to the previous day, at one thousand taels. Jewelry gold also dropped by two yuan, and Customs Gold remained unchanged. However, Sino-British pure gold continued to rise.

### Spot Silver Plunges by Twelve Yuan

From the morning, a certain gold dealer immediately announced a selling price of 2092-3 yuan per bar (ten taels). However, buyers only offered 90 yuan, and it was not until 9:45 that the gold dealer sold 50 taels to the Qian-Dui banks at 2091 yuan, which was five yuan lower than the previous day's low. After the opening, most people adopted a wait-and-see attitude, with only a few buyers bidding prices aggressively, breaking into the 90 yuan range. A certain gold dealer then sold 50 taels to a jewelry shop gang at 86 yuan. Following this, the same jewelry shop gang sold 50 taels to a Qian-Dui bank at the same price. Later, the jewelry shop gang sold another 50 taels to a certain silver firm for 87 yuan. The jewelry shop gang then sold another 50 taels to a Qian-Dui bank for 86 yuan. A certain Qian-Dui bank, on behalf of its customers, sold 50 taels each to security firms and fellow Qian-Dui banks at 87 yuan each. After this, the jewelry shop gang stopped buying and began selling heavily, further weakening the underlying trend. Qian-Dui banks transacted 50 taels between themselves at 83 yuan. The jewelry shop gang sold 50 taels to a Qian-Dui bank at 82 yuan. Qian-Dui banks transacted 50 taels between themselves at 80 yuan. The jewelry shop gang sold 50 taels to a Qian-Dui bank at 77 yuan. Qian-Dui banks transacted 50 taels between themselves, with the lowest price reaching 76 yuan. After this, a wave of buyers suddenly took advantage of the low prices and aggressively bought, while sellers stopped selling and watched from the sidelines, leading to a rebound and a strengthening trend. The Qian-Dui bank bought 50 taels from a gold dealer at 81 yuan as the midday closing price. In the afternoon, the Qian-Dui bank first sold 50 taels to a gold dealer at 78 yuan. After this, due to news of a slight weakness in the US dollar, the price rebounded again. Qian-Dui banks transacted 50 taels between themselves at 80 yuan. A gold dealer bought 50 taels from a Qian-Dui bank at 81 yuan, and then bought another 50 taels from the Qian-Dui bank at 86 yuan. Finally, a securities firm bought 50 taels from a spot silver dealer at 2084 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price fell by twelve yuan compared to the previous closing price, with a daily difference of fifteen yuan.

### Jewelry Gold Drops Twice

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael initially remained unchanged. However, at 11 o'clock, due to the weakening of spot silver, the price was slightly reduced by one yuan. More than ten minutes later, hearing that spot silver was weakening further, the price was reduced by another yuan. The Dahang Tonghang (Big Bank Tonghang) revised their listed price to 211 yuan, and the Xinhang Tonghang (New Bank Tonghang) revised their price to 209 yuan, with a buying price of 203 yuan.

### Pure Gold Rises Again by Half a Penny

A London telegram dated the 16th stated that, due to the continued weakness of the British pound, British pure gold rose again by half a penny per ounce, reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, and six pence. This caused the central bank's Chinese cash buying price to also rise to 1212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price of Customs Gold remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 4 jiao, reaching 1207 yuan and 6 jiao.

### Foreign Currencies Stable

Yesterday, British pure gold continued to rise by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate continued to decline by 0.0025. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were eagerly closing positions, and banks were providing sufficient supply, so the prices remained stable. Only the US dollar showed slight weakness due to the continuous decline in the British-American cross rate. Spot silver investors were uncertain. The market opened weak, but small investors maintained their buying. Wealthy and Tianjin investors remained inactive and provided no support, leading to long-awaited position closings and a weakening market. Later, bullion dealers and Qian-Dui banks took advantage of the low prices to buy, slightly reversing the downward trend. Afternoon buying remained scarce, and trading volume decreased, resulting in a weak trend. Due to the weakness of spot silver, British and American gold pounds saw wealthy investors gradually emerge and sell, leading to a slight price decrease. British and American gold notes, and Hong Kong notes, were slightly more in demand, leading to a slight price increase. Recently, the trend of buying and selling has gradually decreased, and the market is extremely stable. Transactions at the Exchange Association were rare. Only Huitong sold 200 US gold notes to Yongtai. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell by 5 fen, British gold notes rose by 9 fen, American gold pounds fell by 1 jiao, American gold notes rose by 0.0013 yuan, Hong Kong notes rose by 0.0003 yuan, French franc notes fell by 5 hao, Dutch notes rose by 0.01 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Instability in Central European Situation, British-American Exchange Rates Fall for Three Consecutive Days

Local Exchange Market Sees British Flatness and American Tightness

Due to the instability in the Central European situation and Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, the British-American exchange rate suddenly fell sharply. Yesterday, it fell another 0.00025 (investigation shows that it has fallen for three consecutive days, totaling 0.0008, to 8.125), leading to a situation of British flatness and American tightness. During the middle of the day, although foreign firms were slightly settling accounts, the market remained relatively flat due to the banks' willingness to supply. However, the American exchange rate saw weak selling interest from the banks due to operators expecting the British-American exchange rate to continue to weaken. In addition, a sudden surge in Hong Kong telegrams, despite some Tianjin speculators selling positions, ultimately saw more buying than selling, leading to a gradual weakening trend. The Hong Kong exchange rate, on the other hand, tended to ease due to frequent selling by foreign banks and Chinese banks.

After the opening, although foreign firms came to settle accounts, they were not affected due to the banks' willingness to supply. The announcement of the white silver equalization tax showed no increase or decrease, remaining at 8.50%. Later, although Tianjin speculators tended to sell, the market remained unchanged as banks took advantage of the low prices to buy. The Tianjin investors sold 16.125 yuan of American exchange to a favorable Dutch bank. Near noon, foreign banks Huayi and Chinese banks sold 55.375 yuan of Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms, and the market slightly strengthened. The midday closing bank selling price was 8.000825 pounds for the British exchange rate and 16.09375 yuan for the American exchange rate, unchanged from the morning opening.

In the afternoon, foreign firms came to buy British exchange from HSBC and favorable banks at 8.000825 pounds. Subsequently, a sudden surge in Hong Kong telegrams led to a slight weakening of the American exchange rate. The Hong Kong telegrams closed 16.09375 to 16.0625 yuan of American exchange with favorable Dutch Huabi bank. Finally, foreign bank Anda and Chinese bank sold 55.25 to 55.375 yuan of Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms, and the underlying trend gradually stabilized. By the evening closing bank selling price, the British exchange rate was 8.000825 pounds, and the American exchange rate was 16.0625 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British was flat, and the American was tight by 0.0003125, while the Hong Kong exchange rate conversely rose by 0.000125.

### Securities: Rumors of New Government Bond Issuance, Minimal Impact on Market

Market Once Chaotic, Quickly Recovered, Far East British Business Stocks Plunged

Yesterday, the security black market saw a situation where rumors of the government planning to issue 120 million yuan in new government bonds caused unnecessary confusion in the market. Some even used this opportunity to suppress prices, hoping to buy at low prices. Therefore, the opening market was extremely chaotic. Type E opened at only 49.2 yuan, and Type C opened at 50.07 yuan, a difference of as much as half a yuan. Subsequently, the prices quickly rebounded. According to rumors, a portion of this bond issuance is intended as a 5 million pound reserve for the Bank of Communications, while the remainder is for the development of the Northwest. The rumors state that it is entirely for production purposes and still needs to be confirmed. However, it can be said with certainty that this type of bond is unrelated to the unified national debt circulating in the market and that the issuance of new government bonds indirectly adds a layer of protection to the old government bonds. However, there is too much speculation in the market, which easily causes fluctuations. After this round of elimination, most of the small speculative investors have cut their losses, while the large bullish investors have remained steadfast and unmoved. Those who were shorting previously are now going long, so there are signs that the future trend will change. Yuan Da first suppressed the market in the morning, causing prices to become chaotic. Tiansheng Hao and Number 35 took the opportunity to aggressively buy, causing Type E to immediately rebound by one yuan. Although Defu Tongkang and Number 15 sold, Chen Kang Mao Da Runli and others continued to buy, and the price gradually stabilized. In the morning, it was slightly higher at 0.068 yuan. In the afternoon, the situation stabilized, Da Feng Hao switched from short to long, and Xie Da Yongkang and Number 52 all bought in. Although Defu and Number 11 continued to sell, the market gradually strengthened, and the rebound of 0.4 to 0.5 yuan was already determined, and the trend will likely change. The resulting market price was only slightly lower by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Bond Type | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day
---|---|---|---|---
Unified A | 57.51 | 57.20 | 57.55 | Down 0.35
Unified B | 51.70 | 51.30 | 51.65 | Down 0.30

### Yarn and Cloth: Spot Yarn Market Becomes Hat Trading

The reason for the market's inability to recover lies in this.

The yarn market has slightly recovered, but the increase is extremely slow. The reason is that customer sales remain slack and show no signs of improvement. Market transactions are still mostly occupied by transactions between the same industry, which is completely a kind of "grabbing the hat" mentality. If they can profit by one or two yuan, they will sell it off. Therefore, the market is unusually lively with people gathering, but upon investigation, the actual business is very little. If this situation continues, the inventory will inevitably become thicker and thicker. If the spot prices don't rise for a long time, there is a deep concern that it will ultimately be difficult to escape the need to stand firm and tend towards rising. In the afternoon, buyers from Yunnan and Shantou were slightly more active, and the market atmosphere tightened. The fundamental problem still lies in considering the actual sales. However, transactions still occupy more than 50% of the same industry.

The situation of spot yarn, the opening of the morning is still loose and weak, 20-count Double Horse sold for 392 yuan, with little difference from the previous day. However, there was a certain firm in the market searching for ten counts of yarn. The Hunan gang had a little business of 32-count fine yarn, and the atmosphere was slightly agitated, bringing it up one yuan. In the end, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 393.5 yuan, and the price of the warehouse receipt was 391.5 yuan. In the afternoon, the atmosphere was slightly higher, and the market was strong due to the slight needs of the southern region. No spot Double Horse was traded, and the price of the warehouse receipt was 392 yuan. As a result, the total amount of purchases from each gang throughout the day was 1,470 packages, and the average price rose by one to three yuan. However, the price increase of fine yarn was stronger. The factory opened up 120 packages of 10-count Flying Tiger from the Anda factory, with a price of 289.5 yuan. The Tianjin gang went there. Today, there are still 250 pieces of cotton yarn being transported to Fuzhou, another 280 pieces being transported to Shantou, and 25 pieces being transported to Hong Kong. The amounts bought by each gang are listed on the left:

Same Industry: 850; Xiamen: 20; Inland: 115
Hong Kong: 20; Shantou: 105; Hunan: 50
Wenzhou: 25; Sichuan: 35; Ningbo: 10
Tianjin: 120; Yunnan: 120

Total: 1,470

The Japanese yarn market continues to rise, because the sales of 16-count yarn are smooth, and the northern buyers are very strong. Thus, it affects the 20-count yarn to also bring up the rise. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon is 338 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix is 330 to 329 yuan.

### Tongzhou Cotton Rises Again by One Yuan

Peak Price Reaches Seventy-Nine Yuan, U.S. Cotton Price Drops, Transactions Slightly Active

The cotton business is still considered not weak, but less than the previous day. This is because the price continues to rise, and there is very little stock, making it difficult for factories to start, leading to a reduction in transactions. However, Tongzhou cotton has reached a new peak, with a price of seventy-nine yuan, an increase of one yuan from the previous day. Shanghai Fire Engine cotton also continues to rise by seven and a half jiao. With prices only rising and not falling, how can factories start? However, with no hope of supply, the market price is difficult to relax. Therefore, both Chinese and foreign factories are purchasing foreign cotton to compensate. Based on this situation, it is predicted that the purchase of foreign cotton is on the rise. Today, a Japanese factory imported 300 bales of Tianjin cotton, Yufeng purchased 1,000 bales of U.S. cotton, and Shenxin also imported 450 bales of U.S. cotton. Arrivals at the dock include 466 bales of Xiashe fine velvet cotton. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:

Tianjin Cotton 86.25 Imported by Dakang Factory 200 bales Cash to factory

Squillamite 90.75 Imported by Yufeng Factory 1,000 bales Cash to warehouse

### Fifteen Sixteenths

Foreign cotton market price: New York cotton market is weak because of widespread rumors that the U.S. government's loan cotton will be released to encourage exports and provide cotton export subsidies to compete with the world cotton market. Therefore, the industry believes that it is necessary to release the loan cotton. Liverpool telegraphed a decline; spot merchants sold out and southern hedging was very strong, resulting in a sharp drop of ten pounds in recent and spot prices. India, including forecasts, fell two rupees; Egypt fell more than twenty pounds. Converted to legal currency, cotton prices have fallen: U.S. cotton and Brazilian cotton fell eight jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell seven jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell one yuan and one jiao.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading: due to the decline in New York prices, there were some transactions in U.S. cotton. Shenxin imported 500 bales of Argentine cotton at a delivered-to-factory price of 91 yuan. It also imported 108 bales of Indian cotton at a price of 76 yuan. Litai imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton at a price of 74 yuan. On the Japanese factory side, the Shanghai factory imported 1,000 bales of Brazilian cotton, Toyota imported 500 bales of U.S. cotton, Gongda and domestic and foreign factories each imported 500 bales, and the remaining factories had no transactions.

### Piece Goods: Bleaching and Dyeing Factories' Output is Slow, Summer Goods Sales are Increasingly Popular

Domestic cloth, spring and summer light-colored piece goods: the three largest new bleaching and dyeing factories in this city have not yet started operation, resulting in the dozen or so factories in operation having concerns about neglecting one thing while attending to another during this period when spring sales in this city and other cities are coming one after another. Grey cloth is congested, and the output of various mass-market finished products, such as poplin, bleached cloth, mercerized yarn, and light-colored cloth, is slow. It is difficult for customers to respond to the current demand, so the market atmosphere is particularly tense, and sales prices have been raised one after another, especially yarn-dyed poplin shirts and plain poplin. Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants still account for the majority of sales. Guangdong merchants purchased more than 2,000 pieces of colored twill and more than 20 boxes of colored cloth poplin, and five or sixty packages of Fuguigui and other brands of fine cloth and fine twill. Wen and Yong merchants have a strong demand for white goods and fine cloth, with continued transactions of more than 100 packages of various brands, and about 50 packages of coarse cloth and fine and coarse twill. Sales prices are slightly fixed. Tianjin merchants purchased one hundred and several dozen boxes of goods such as poplin, blue cloth, and bleached cloth. The dye factory on this street purchased more than 100 packages of low-grade fine twill.

Due to the strong sales of colored cloth and colored twill in recent days, the dye factories on this street continue to need grey cloth, so the sales price of fine cloth and fine twill is gradually firm. The sales on this street are the largest outlet. Yesterday, orders reached another thousand pieces. Qingdao and Tianjin merchants only imported more than 300 packages of fine cloth. Dongmian Bank opened 3-400 pieces of 11-pound Blue Day fine cloth and Dragon Head Baby fine twill, the sales price of Blue Day fine cloth is 11.25 yuan per piece, Dragon Head fine twill is 11.7 yuan for next month, 11.65 yuan for this month, and Baby fine twill is 11.35 yuan.

Today, 1,400 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin, 120 pieces to Yantai, 380 pieces to Shantou, and 20 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Grains: It is Said That Changshu and Other Production Areas Have Stopped Issuing Transport Permits

Shanghai's Du Geng Sales are Dull, Foreign Customers and Japanese Merchants are Inquiring

Du Geng: Yesterday, a total of eleven boats arrived from various sources in Heshui, and one to two thousand packages were transported by truck. The arrival of goods was suddenly scarce. It is said that a certain party has stopped issuing transport permits in Changshu and other places since the 15th of this month, so sellers' minds are firm and they hold on tightly. However, the sales market is dull, so most of the goods have not been sold. The market shows a situation of stability with softness. Hou Geng has fixed or small price changes of one or two jiao, Bo Dao has a price reduction of jiao, and Du Yangjiambu's supply and demand are similar and there is no change.

Ke Xian: Yesterday's Ke Xian digestion was still active. In addition to merchants and hoarders absorbing at low prices, retail customers also liked it very much, and Japanese merchants inquired about it, so the total market transaction opened to more than 4,000 packages, and the market price stabilized and was not affected by the Heshui Gengjian. Gao Mi is more stable. Nanjing Xian opened at 12.7-8 yuan, Wuhu Xian opened at 12.5-6 yuan, and the secondary grades varied.

Yang Mi: Fixed orders are not realized, and merchants and hoarders have always adhered to their position. Amidst the wild dumping of various rice prices in recent days, Yang Mi has not been affected. Yesterday, various households on this street handled 2-300 packages of Saigon No. 1, 198-jin original packages, which still opened at 17 yuan.

### Lack of Instant Powder, Factory Prices Hint at Higher Prices

The flour market is gradually becoming firm. Sales to customers from the North and South are quite active. Due to the current shortage of instant powder and limited daily production, factories cannot fully supply it. They are insisting on the same price for local customers, and there are even hints of higher prices. Recently, the market price of foreign flour has also risen due to reports of rising prices abroad. Futures for March and April have been fully booked, and the price for May is 2.58 to 2.6 US dollars per barrel of four packages. Foreign firms have repeatedly made transactions, and the amount already ordered but not yet arrived is about 1 million packages. As for yesterday's local flour transactions, local customers totaled 3-40,000 packages. Supply and demand are still considered equal, and the market is brewing.

The wheat market is still stagnant. Recently, 2-300 packages arrive at the port in sporadic amounts every day, mostly directly sent to factories for pricing. Based on quality, they range from about 7 yuan to 6.7-8 yuan. Yesterday, it was reported that a flour factory in Hongkou Zhabei also purchased wheat directly from the production area because of a lack of wheat supply and no goods to receive.

Today, 2,500 packages of flour are exported to Tianjin, 7,000 packages to Fuzhou, 12,000 packages to Shantou, and 2,000 packages of bran are exported to Shantou.

### Silk and Tea: Foreign Silk Initiates Second Price Increase

If Shanghai Silk Can Handle Itself Well, Sales to the US May Be Possible

Yesterday's silk market saw another surge in Japan and the United States. New York spot Japanese silk rose by 7 cents each, Chinese silk rose by 5 cents each, and near and far futures rose by 4 to 5 cents. Yokohama spot prices rose by 35 yuan, and far futures rose by 40 yuan. In the afternoon, spot prices rose by another 5 yuan, but the far futures unanimously declined, such as a drop of 11 yuan in March, 18 yuan in April, 17 yuan in May, and 19 yuan in July. Lyon Shanghai Silk A rose by half a franc, and other Chinese and Japanese raw silk rose by one franc each.

The local silk market has no development in domestic or foreign sales. Foreign sales are still priced at 1,700 yuan. However, according to observation, if domestic silk prices do not rise blindly again, like the last time, then sales to the United States may be possible, because since the second price increase in foreign silk prices, the distance between Chinese and American silk prices has been greatly shortened. In terms of domestic sales, firstly, most silk factories have switched to using rayon, and they are indifferent to the rising wind of raw silk, which has made it impossible for hoarders to come out of their shells, and the number of transactions has decreased significantly. Yesterday, it was heard that the asking price for B-grade white silk has risen to 1,800 yuan. Although foreign firms have sent telegrams, they will have to see how the market goes today.

### Oilcake: Many Floaters Spit Out, Soybean Oil Falls Back, and Vegetable Oil and Bean Cake Also See Small Faces

Soybean Oil: Yesterday's soybean oil market fell at the beginning of the morning, because general profit-taking floaters were eager to exit, spot oil fell 3-4 jiao, and futures oil fell 6-7 jiao. In the afternoon, Dalian all rose, and the market atmosphere tightened. According to statistics, 30 pieces of Lianqi Da were made, with a price of 29.8 yuan. 70 barrels of spot Dalian oil were priced at 32 yuan and 32.1 yuan. 200 barrels for delivery in 7 days were priced at 31.9 yuan. 100 barrels for next March were priced at 31.85 yuan. 500 barrels of Fengnian oil for April were priced at 31.5 to 7 jiao. According to the investigation, 400 packages of soybeans were exported to Fuzhou today, and another 1,000 packages were shipped to Hong Kong.

Vegetable Oil: Yesterday's trading was sluggish. Only 20 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, priced at 31 yuan, a small drop of half a yuan. This is because Yantai Ting-packed oil will arrive soon, causing the market atmosphere to ease slightly. In addition, there were 38 barrels of Dalian barrel vegetable oil, priced at 40 yuan. It is said that the oil was returned by merchants and hoarders to realize profits on contracts for the next March.

Bean Cake: Yesterday, the market was slightly frustrated because the Dalian market reported small losses. Futures cake fell by 5 fen, and 20,000 pieces of Lianguang cake were traded in May, priced at 3.15 yuan. However, spot cake continued to rise by 1 fen. 500 pieces of Dayou four-brand cake were sold by the Fuzhou merchants, priced at 3.47 yuan.

### North and South Goods: Jian Gu Continues to Rise

Fujian shiitake mushrooms have already arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, they were immediately released, with thin mushrooms priced at 207.7 yuan, high thin mushrooms at 215.5 yuan to 222.8 yuan. Special Zhuangling mushrooms are in short supply, and ordinary mushrooms are priced at 233 yuan, and the situation is quite tight, rising more than 20 yuan compared to the previous market.

### Sugar Market: Shantou Cotton White Transactions Still Strong

Yesterday's sugar market trend was stable. The association drew plates, and the spot price of 24 Dutch crude white was called 24.85 yuan, this warehouse's goods were 85 jiao, and transshipment was 16.55 yuan. Buyers are scarce. Taikoo Sugar B mark carmine has not changed. For domestic sugar, only Chao merchants opened more, and a batch of cotton white was traded, totaling more than 500 packages. The price of enough ice was 24.4 yuan, secondary grades were 3 jiao to 1 jiao, ice flower white was 23.5 yuan to 22.5 yuan, and the lowest was 21 yuan. As Jian merchants continue to increase arrivals of diaoqing, the original price is called, with no transactions. The future market should have a loosening hope. Two ships, Shandong Ganzhou, arrived in succession, carrying 600 packages of Taikoo car white, 100 pieces of boxed sugar, 2,143 packages of Qingchi sugar, 1,012 pieces of white sugar, and 71 pieces of Beihai red.

### Hardware: Tianjin Merchants Search for Black Iron Billets, Sales Prices Gradually Rise

Black iron billets: due to year-end relations, holders were eager to sell, so the situation deteriorated. The previous market price had shrunk to 28 yuan (calculated per 200 pounds). However, since the new year, the standard has slightly improved, with each box selling for around 28.5 yuan. Recently, the market situation has become more bullish. It was found that yesterday's opening price has reached 29.5 yuan. In terms of actual sales, all are purchased by Tianjin merchants, so the spot goods on the market are unusually thin, and the market is difficult to loosen.

Transportation and Transportation Weekly

### Publishing Purpose

— Deng Bingquan

The China Travel Service has been established for seventeen years. Its usual mission is to serve society and facilitate travel. The public's understanding of our company is becoming clearer, and their expectations for our company are also growing. To adapt to the needs of the times, our company has established branches and hostels in important cities to provide welfare for travelers, but it is still unable to provide extensive services. Only those who contact our company can our company do its best to provide services. I don’t know how many people are unable to use our company. Thanks to the Sheng intention of Shenbao, our company is allowed to cooperate and issue the "Transportation and Transportation" weekly magazine. In the future, we will use the wide sales network of Shenbao to make close contact with people in society, and our company will be able to provide extensive services.

The content of this publication strives to adapt to the times and strives to be a practical and useful reading material. Therefore, when we meet the world in the first issue, we reveal the following points:

(1) This publication mainly provides domestic and foreign transportation news. The conditions of railways, highways, aviation, and ship imports and exports are all provided to readers with accurate news under the principle of being simple and clear.

(2) In addition to transportation news, we will also provide short reports on the actual conditions of various routes. However, this type of text is completely different from travel notes, because the space is limited and we cannot write texts describing the scenery.

(3) At this extraordinary period, cargo transportation is unusually stagnant. How can we shorten the time and economy? It is all related to the choice of route. This publication will investigate at any time for readers' reference.

(4) In addition, we should contribute opinions on travel knowledge so that readers know what to pay attention to. A travel Q&A column will also be opened. Please ask readers for inquiries, and we will provide detailed answers within the possible scope.

The above points are just a goal, and we will work hard to achieve it. However, colleagues have limited knowledge and it is difficult to be perfect. I hope readers will come forward and teach.

(2) Take a boat from Shanghai to Wenzhou first, then take a boat to Qingtian, and then take a car through Wenxi to Lishui, and take a highway bus from Lishui to Jinhua.

### Haiphong to Kunming Yunnan-Vietnam Train Situation

— Jing

From Haiphong to Kunming, there is the Sino-French joint venture Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which runs directly between them, which is convenient for passengers. The engineering of this road is very great. There are more than 160 large mountain caves along the way, which shows the general situation. However, the track of this road is relatively narrow, and the number of passengers and cargo carried is also smaller due to this. From Defense to Yunnan, there are two types of vehicles: ordinary and express. Now I will briefly describe them separately. 1. Ordinary trains take a train from Haiphong to Hanoi every day. There are five fast and slow trains on this section every day, which only takes two hours to reach. The second train departs from Hanoi at 9:20 a.m., arrives in Lao Cai at 7:11 p.m. that day, departs from Lao Cai at 6:22 a.m. on the third morning, arrives in Kaiyuan at 6:07 p.m. that day, and departs from Kaiyuan at 6:36 a.m. on the fourth morning. You can arrive in Kunming at 4:47 p.m. that day. Passengers who take ordinary trains do not have sleeper facilities on the train. Passengers must find their own hotels in various places along the way. Fortunately, there are hotels established by the country in Hanoi, Lao Cai, Kaiyuan and other places, and there are no very inconvenient places.

2. Express trains only run twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. First, take a car from Haiphong to Hanoi. On the same day, take an express train from Hanoi to Yongmai at 8:30 p.m. This section of the train runs at night, and there are sleepers on the train, but only first and second class have sleeper facilities, and third class does not. The first class is divided into two types: A and B. Type A costs 6 Vietnamese dollars per person, and Type B costs 4.5 yuan per person. The second class costs 3 yuan per person. After arriving in Yongmai at 5:39 a.m. on the second day, you will have to transfer to the Michelin express train. The so-called Michelin train is similar to a public bus, with twelve rubber wheels running on the track. The speed is quite fast, but there are very few seats in the car. Those departing from Yongmai on Wednesdays only have 15 first-class seats. Those departing from Yongmai on Fridays only have 18 first-class seats and 19 third-class seats. Passengers should register in advance in Haiphong before departure, otherwise they will not be able to get a seat. The car departs from Yongmai at 6:19 a.m. and arrives in Kunming at 6:42 p.m. on the same day. Each person is only allowed to carry 15 kilograms of luggage on the Michelin train, and the free luggage allowance is still 30 kilograms, which can be delivered by ordinary train one or two days before departure.

The ticket price is difficult to calculate because the railway is divided into two sections, the domestic section and the Vietnamese section, and the currency system of each section is different. Now, according to the latest exchange rate, the ticket price is as follows in the combined Chinese currency:

First class: approximately 149.00 yuan in Chinese currency, second class: 104.63 yuan, and third class: approximately 54.6 yuan.

(The prices for through trains and express trains are the same)

Please inquire with China Travel Service at any time for other detailed information.
