### Containing the Japanese Army's Attempt to Invade Westward from Heshan: Chinese Forces Deploy a Strong Defensive Formation. Remaining Japanese Troops Near Ge Wei (阁尾) in Sanshui Have Been Annihilated. Japanese Troops are Concentrating on Weizhou Island, Intending to Use it as a Key Base.

Hong Kong: The war situation in the West River area has been relatively quiet for the past two days. However, Japanese troops near Jiujiang seem to be making suspicious movements. Major Chinese forces have arrived at a certain location and

have deployed a strong defensive formation to control the Japanese army's attempt to invade westward from Heshan along the Gaoyao-Gaoming highway. After the Sanshui position was attacked by Chinese guerrillas,

a large fire broke out. Furthermore, Japanese troops are concentrating forces from the Guang-San (Guangzhou-Sanshui) and Jiang-Fo (Jiangmen-Foshan) roads to the areas of Makou and Yangmei in Sanshui, seemingly planning to first attack Sihui

and then advance westward towards Zhaoqing. According to reports received by Chinese authorities, the Japanese army's advance along the West River is aimed at concealing their conspiracy to invade Guilin from the south.

It is reported that there are over 20,000 Japanese troops on Weizhou Island, using the island as a base for invading southern Guangdong. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)

Sihui: According to reports, the remaining Japanese troops near Ge Wei (阁尾) in Sanshui have been annihilated by Chinese forces. Currently, there are no traces of Japanese troops on the opposite bank of Sanshui. (Fifth Day)

Guangzhou: The situation here is

slightly better than before. Therefore,

the restrictions on Chinese people entering

Shamian (沙面) have been partially lifted.

Chinese people can now enter and exit

the Shamian concession between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM

without having to show a pass. However,

restrictions are still in place in the city.

Japanese sentries continue

to be stationed at the intersections of certain streets,

searching passing Chinese people

and checking the passes of foreigners. The "Maintenance Committee" here

has started organizing a new police force, as there has been no "police" since

Guangzhou fell. The committee recently issued

a notice, summoning all former police officers

to register for possible employment. (

Hong Kong: A Hong Kong correspondent

for the Central Daily News reports that,

according to reliable sources,

although Japan recently declared

a large-scale offensive from Beihai,

hoping for peace, this offensive

seems unlikely to materialize temporarily. Japan

feels deeply isolated diplomatically and has therefore decided to adopt

a neutral policy, relying on Germany and Italy

for support. On February 3, Japanese Foreign Minister

Arita, in response to a question in the Diet

regarding the convening of an

international conference, stated that if the

international situation continues to deteriorate and other

countries still fail to understand Japan's policies,

then Japan will have to reconsider its

attitude. If any country other than the Soviet Union

attacks Japan, then Japan will

rise to the challenge. (Fifth Day Associated Press Dispatch)

### Northeastern Four Provinces: Decision to Establish a Legal Provincial Government. Organizational Rules are Being Drafted. Candidates for Provincial Chairmen Have Also Been Internally Determined.

Chongqing: According to reports

from Chinese military sources, the Chinese government recently

decided to establish legal

provincial governments in the four northeastern provinces, similar

to those in Shandong, Hebei,

Chahar—and Anhui, among other occupied

provinces. The organizational rules are currently being

drafted and will soon be officially

announced. It is reported that the chairmen

of the four provinces have been tentatively decided:

Ma Zhanshan as Chairman of Heilongjiang, Li

as Chairman of Liaoning Province, and Feng Yong as Chairman of Rehe

Province. (Sixth Day Associated Press Dispatch)

### Chinese Troops Briefly Entered Julu City

Zhengzhou: Chinese guerrillas in Hebei

Province have become more active in recent

days, with the following achievements: On the morning of the 29th

of last month, a Chinese unit attacked Zhaoerzhai, killing over twenty

Japanese soldiers and capturing seventeen rifles. On the morning of the 30th, at 3:00 AM,

a Chinese unit stormed into Julu City. A portion of the Japanese army

fled outside the city, where they were intercepted by a Chinese unit

stationed outside the city. They then fled back into the city. Up until noon

on the 30th, several hundred Japanese soldiers had been killed. Later, due to Japanese aircraft bombing

and the arrival of Japanese reinforcements, the Chinese army, in order to avoid sacrifices,

safely withdrew. (Sixth Day Dispatch)

### Chinese Air Force Displays Power: Bombarding Japanese Positions in Southern Shanxi. Serious Damage to the Liancheng Japanese Airfield. A Section of the Shanpu (Shanxi-Puzhou) Road Was Also Destroyed. Japanese Army Suffers Major Defeat in the Assault on Zhongtiao Mountain. Xinhua Daily Believes Japan's War Plan Has Completely Failed.

Xi'an: The Japanese army attacking Zhongtiao Mountain suffered a major setback after being resisted by Chinese forces for several days. The Chinese Air Force also cooperated with the ground forces in the battle. On the 5th,

in the afternoon, several Chinese aircraft flew to bombard Japanese positions in southern Shanxi, dropping dozens of bombs on Japanese positions on both sides of the Tongpu (Datong-Puzhou) Railway, all of which hit their targets.

The Japanese suffered heavy losses, and a section of the Tongpu Railway was destroyed. By 6:00 PM, the Chinese aircraft had completed their mission and safely returned to base. (Sixth Day Dispatch)

A certain location: On the 5th, a squadron of Chinese aircraft departed from a certain location to bomb the Japanese airfield in Yuncheng, southern Shanxi. They arrived at their destination in the afternoon and

saw over forty Japanese aircraft parked there. Under the precise aim of the Chinese aircraft, they calmly dropped bombs, all of which hit their targets. The area where the Japanese aircraft were parked immediately

caught fire, and dust flew everywhere, engulfing the entire airfield, inflicting enormous losses on the Japanese army. The Chinese aircraft, after dropping bombs in a situation unexpected by the Japanese army,

safely flew back to their base, creating the first miraculous achievement of the 28th year (of the Republic). (Sixth Day Dispatch)

Chongqing: When the Japanese army occupied Liaoxian,

they expressed optimism about the success

of their operation to suppress guerrillas in southeastern Shanxi. The Communist Party's

organ, Xinhua Daily, advised the Japanese not to be

too optimistic too early. Liaoxian, located seventy li

southeast of Taiyuan, fell into the hands

of the Japanese army on January 30.

On February 3, after the Eighth Route Army

adopted a strategy of cutting off the flanks and ambushing the rear,

it had already been retaken by the Chinese army.

The Japanese army in Liaoxian had already retreated twenty

li north towards Heshun. After two short

hours of fierce fighting, the Eighth Route Army completely

annihilated the left flank of the Japanese army with

ambush tactics. At the end of last month, when the Japanese army occupied

Heshun and Liaoxian, they first used

poison gas. In the last week

of January, the use of poison gas by the Japanese army

resulted in 500 casualties for the Eighth Route Army.

Currently, the Eighth Route Army has Heshun surrounded.

The Japanese army's initial plan for operations in southeastern Shanxi

has completely failed. The

optimism of the Japanese headquarters in Taiyuan

is merely self-deception.

army became disorganized and scattered, fleeing in all directions. The Chinese army

took advantage of the situation to counterattack, achieving a great victory

and completely routing the Japanese army. In this battle, the Chinese army

defeated a numerically superior enemy, and the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. Furthermore,

a unit of a certain Chinese division attacked

Xiaxian on the evening of the 3rd, causing over a hundred Japanese casualties. On the 4th,

several trucks loaded with corpses left for

Yuncheng. (Sixth Day Dispatch)

Yulin: Due to exceptionally heavy casualties among

the Japanese forces in the invasion of China and a severe shortage of troops,

the Japanese army has recently been conscripting

Chinese able-bodied men into the army on a large scale in the occupied areas of the north and south.

In areas such as Beiping, Shijiazhuang,

and Zhangjiakou, able-bodied men

between the ages of twenty

and forty-five are all being conscripted.

Refusal to comply will be considered an act of resistance against Japan. The people in these

areas are extremely angry and have all joined

Chinese guerrilla forces to participate in the war of resistance.

Editorial

### The Inflation of the Japanese Paper Currency Under Expanding War Expenditure

News reports indicate that Japan's special military budget for the next fiscal year will be 5.4 billion yen. If

this is combined with the general accounting budget for the next fiscal year, then the financial expenditure that the Japanese people should

bear in the coming year will exceed 9 billion.

Since the July 7th Incident, up to this fiscal year, the war expenditure consumed by Japan, excluding

the ordinary accounting, has totaled a staggering 7.4 billion, which is almost

entirely made up for by public bonds. Therefore, to estimate the state of Japan's financial collapse next year,

one only needs to estimate the situation of public bond planning in the past to get a rough idea.

Japan's method of issuing public bonds has, up to now, arguably become just another way of increasing

paper currency issuance. The public bonds that Japan should issue this fiscal year amount to over 6 billion,

but by the end of November last year, only 3.6 billion had been absorbed.

Of this, 2.8 billion had been bought by various banks and insurance companies,

while the rest was in the hands of the Bank of Japan. The purchase of public bonds by banks and insurance companies

is not due to an increase in Japan's wealth. Statistics show that Japan's total

savings recently, due to the effects of currency inflation, have increased compared to before, but

the number of loans granted has relatively decreased sharply, showing that the power of Japanese banks and insurance companies

to purchase public bonds has all been transferred from the loaning sector. In other words,

the underwriting of public bonds by Japanese banks and insurance companies has already encroached upon their usable

capacity; they are simply unable to refuse to purchase under the compulsion of the government.

Even under these compulsory circumstances, Japan has only issued

a portion of the public bonds it should have issued, and the amount of public bonds held by the Bank of Japan

is still increasing day by day. The Bank of Japan's method of coping with this is simply to increase the amount of paper currency. This

can be seen from Japan's recent issuance and absorption of paper currency.

The issuance of Japanese paper currency has always been divided into two parts: one part is gold reserves,

and the other part is security reserves. Before the war, the Bank of Japan held 500 million

yen in gold, and the issuance limit under the name of security reserves was 1 billion yen. Therefore, the Bank of Japan's

paper currency issuance was about 1.5 billion yen at most. After the outbreak of the war, Japan

soon revalued its gold reserves, expanding the gold held by the Bank of Japan from 500 million

to over 1 billion yen due to the increased valuation. After this valuation,

the gold under the Japanese paper currency issuance was falsely expanded to 800 million yen, most of

which was used for the purchase of raw materials overseas under the name of "special accounting."

In reality, this was another trick to increase issuance.

On the one hand, the value of gold was raised by surreptitious means to expand the paper currency issuance

under the name of gold reserves. On the other hand, the public bonds issued for security reserves

were expanded from 1 billion yen to 1.7 billion yen, allowing the Bank of Japan to buy more public bonds.

From this time on, the Bank of Japan's issuance amount had expanded from 1.7 billion

in the past to 2.5 billion.

Due to the difficulty in absorbing public bonds, the issuance of Japanese paper currency has been increasingly inflated, and

at the same time, due to the panic of domestic resources, it is impossible not to export gold again! Thus, the gold held

by the Bank of Japan must be turned over again, which is the 300 million yen in gold turned over in June last year under the name of a foreign exchange fund.

From that time on, gold reserves decreased, but the issuance of paper currency did not decrease.

By the end of last year, due to various factors such as the expansion of financial expenses, Japan's

paper currency had expanded to 2.8 billion. According to Japan's existing security reserves,

only 1.7 billion are allowed, and the gold reserves are only 500 million. Then, the Bank of Japan's

total issuance limit is 2.2 billion. Now, the issuance has reached 2.8 billion,

which is more than 600 million yen beyond the limit, isn't it? Isn't that equal to the amount of public bonds that the Bank of Japan cannot issue?

In reality, the existence of gold in Japan has long been a question. Even if we believe

it exists, but as said above, Japan's increase in public bonds has reached the highest limit of compulsory purchase.

The future trend will be nothing more than directly increasing the issuance of paper currency. The over-issuance of paper currency

is to use blank paper to plunder the people's strength, which means the last path on the financial

### No Different Than Engaging in War with Two Countries Simultaneously: The Opinion of American Mr. Fitch
(Chongqing) Today, Mr. Fitch, Secretary of the Chinese Youth Association here, stated in a speech to over 400 people that although American manufacturers have indeed stopped supplying Japan with munitions, they are still transporting large quantities of cotton, iron, gasoline, and other war necessities to Japan. This is no different from China fighting both Japan and the United States simultaneously. He expressed his hope that the U.S. Congress would pass legislation to prohibit the shipment of the aforementioned goods to Japan. He stated that the reason American merchants sell these goods to Japan is solely due to ignorance and profit-seeking. It is noted that Mr. Fitch is an American born in China, has dedicated himself to social work for many years, and has a considerable reputation. He previously served as a director of the refugee zone when Nanjing fell. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Washington Air Mail
President Roosevelt submitted a national defense message to Congress, advocating the appropriation of a huge sum of $2,000,000,000 to expand military preparedness. This is also clear evidence that the U.S. foreign policy is becoming increasingly active. As a result, China will be the first to benefit, and the path of its development will be that the United Kingdom and the United States have, in fact, established a consultative relationship in the Far East. To give a recent example, the U.S. government issued a strong note to Japan on December 31 of last year, opposing the so-called "New Order in East Asia." The United Kingdom followed suit, issuing a similar note on the 14th of last month. At the same time, the U.S. has lent China a large sum of $25,000,000, and the United Kingdom has also granted China a credit loan of £500,000. The American Berranca Aircraft Corporation has also signed a contract with the Chinese government to manufacture 200 bombers. In addition, Secretary of State Hull exerted strong pressure last summer to dissuade American aircraft companies from supplying aircraft to Japan, and all but United Aircraft Corporation have complied. According to the Bureau of Munitions Control, United Aircraft Corporation sold Japan components in December of last year, including 600 propellers, worth $102,000. In this report, it is clearly stated that United Aircraft Corporation is the only merchant that disregards the State Department's admonition. This is also a moral sanction, unprecedented in the past. (Note: United Aircraft Corporation has recently declared that it will accept the State Department's admonition and no longer sell aircraft to Japan.) The U.S. government hopes that aircraft companies will no longer supply aircraft to Japan. This policy was announced by Secretary of State Hull to reporters on June 11 of last year. At the time, it was not considered unusual. It was not until July 1 that the Bureau of Munitions Control issued a report stating that the State Department had also issued a public letter to "all manufacturers and exporters of aircraft and aircraft parts, stating that in accordance with the policy announced on June 11, the State Department does not wish to authorize the export of various aircraft, military equipment installed on aircraft, aircraft engines, medical accessories, aircraft bombs, and aerial torpedoes, which are sold to foreign countries and used by the military to bomb civilians." All of these measures are worthy of attention. In addition, the report also stated that the total value of U.S. arms exports last year was $94,209,432, more than double the $45,076,316 in 1937. The majority of these were aircraft. Buyers included not only China and Japan, but also the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, the Dutch East Indies, and Argentina. The main exporters and the value of the goods they sold are roughly as follows: (1) Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, sold $24,048,639; (2) Glenn Martin Company, sold $11,339,339; Curtiss-Wright Corporation, sold $10,880,567; North American Aviation, sold $9,927,014. What is particularly noteworthy is that the aircraft companies are planning to double their manufacturing output this year, in accordance with the needs of President Roosevelt's military preparedness plan, in order to increase the total number of aircraft to 9,000. According to a survey by Rogers, President of the Aircraft Industries Association, existing U.S. aircraft factories only need to hire more workers and add more tools to increase production to 5,500 aircraft per year. In terms of last year's situation, the U.S. manufactured a total of 3,675 aircraft of various types, of which 1,800 were military aircraft, including those exported. According to Rogers, "Some say that the manufacturing capacity of U.S. aircraft factories has reached its maximum limit, but in fact, it is far from it, because some factories have not actually started production. Therefore, in the early part of last year, the average monthly production of military aircraft was 150, which gradually increased, and has now reached 200 per month. If the number of existing employees is doubled, it is not difficult to manufacture 500 aircraft per month." (Havas)

The Government Army Seeks Peace, But is Rejected by the Nationalist Army: Frequent Contacts on All Sides, European Situation Tense Again
(London) Well-informed diplomatic circles here believe that after the fall of Catalonia, another stage has clearly been demarcated. It is expected that Italy and Germany will exert diplomatic pressure on Britain and France, requesting them to make concessions. Although the Fascist Supreme Council's meeting on Saturday and Sunday did not mention Italy's demands on France, observers in diplomatic circles here believe that the Supreme Council decided at its meeting on Friday that Italy may begin activities, attempting to make demands regarding the administration of Djibouti, Tunisia, and the Suez.

(London) Reuters has learned that the Spanish Republican government has contacted the British government to mediate the civil war. Although no official note has been sent to General Franco, the Nationalist Army has rejected mediation. The United Kingdom is working closely with France to take steps to stop the senseless bloodshed in Spain. As for the nature of these steps, it is currently unknown. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

(Paris) After the sudden turn of events in the Spanish civil war, it is reported that the Republican government proposed peace to the Nationalist government. According to the right-wing "Le Temps," "General Franco, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army, immediately rejected the peace proposal and opposed taking a referendum, demanding that the government army surrender completely. This reply was conveyed to the Republican government by the British Embassy on the afternoon of the 4th of this month. The Cabinet then held an important meeting, with divergent attitudes. Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Del Vayo both opposed surrender. As a result, rifts emerged within the Republican government. Yesterday, Foreign Minister Del Vayo went to Perpignan in southern France to have contacts with diplomats from the United Kingdom and France, and repeatedly spoke with officials from the foreign ministries of the United Kingdom and France by long-distance telephone."

(London) Informed sources have stated that Sir Walter Hodgson, the British Commercial Representative in Burgos, will return to his post in Burgos next week. He has a clear mission: to propose to the Spanish Nationalist government that the United Kingdom provide loans to carry out reconstruction work, such as building houses and purchasing railway materials and tractors, but with political and economic guarantees, namely: (1) this loan will be secured by Spanish customs revenue; (2) the Nationalist government should agree to send foreign combatants back to their countries and recognize the United Kingdom's position in Gibraltar; (3) British ships destroyed by Nationalist aircraft in ports under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Republican government should be compensated by the Nationalist Army; (4) most of the goods needed by Spain should be ordered from the United Kingdom; (5) Spanish industries that employ technicians from Italy and Germany should not be allowed to use British loans to develop. In short, the purpose of the above-mentioned loan is to enable the Spanish Nationalist Army to repay its debts to Italy, so as to eliminate Italian labor and replace it with British influence.

Spanish Government Authorities: The Entirety Fleeing to France
Troops Contacted, Armed Retreat into French Territory: The Nationalist Army 20 Kilometers from the French Border
Perpignan
According to information coming from the border, all personnel of the Spanish Republican government are currently in French territory. It is estimated that 13,000 members of the Republican army have crossed the border. Many tanks and aircraft have already entered the country. It is expected that another 100,000 to 140,000 members of the Republican army will enter French territory successively and will be detained in concentration camps. Once the border obstacles are removed, refugees and defeated soldiers will enter the country in droves. All refugees must be inspected, and any concealed weapons will be confiscated. A total of 27 Republican army aircraft have now landed in French territory. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

After the President of the Republican government went to France, Prime Minister Negrín and most of the cabinet members withdrew from Figueres on the evening of the 4th. The next day, they held a meeting a few kilometers from this town (that is, 15 kilometers from the French border) and decided to take all necessary measures to order the government army to retreat completely and to designate several troops to be transferred to the central region. In the future, the Republican government will choose one of Valencia, Murcia, and Cartagena as the temporary capital. (Havas, 6th)

Perpignan
President Azaña of the Spanish Republican government, Speaker of the House of Representatives Barrio, President of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia Companys, and President of the Autonomous Region of the Basque Country Aguirre crossed the French border in the department of Pyrénées-Orientales today and went to Paris. The Spanish Republican government authorities announced this evening that all government agencies had moved back to Valencia. President Azaña will stay in Paris for some time. In addition, officers and soldiers of the frontline government army in Catalonia are constantly fleeing to the French border and requesting entry. French border authorities are making arrangements to accommodate them and have agreed to accommodate 100,000 personnel. Once these officers and soldiers enter the country, they will be disarmed and sent to the detention camp in Argelès-sur-Mer. There are also many ordinary refugees from Spain fleeing into France. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republican government has established an office in this city specifically to handle registration procedures for these refugees and to help them find places to live in France. In addition, there are still thousands of refugees waiting to enter the country at the border. The French authorities will open the border and allow them to enter the country. (Havas, 5th)

Le Perthus
It was rumored that Negrín, the Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican government, had taken a plane from Figueres in northern Spain to Valencia. It has been learned that this is not true. He entered the French border at 3:15 this morning, along with ministers without portfolio Hoz, Juste, Taylor, Minister of Education Blanco, Minister of Justice Bena, and Minister of Interior Gómez, in eight cars. The roofs of the cars were covered with mattresses and leather bags to prevent air raids. The guards they brought were disarmed upon entry. The first group of soldiers of the government army also crossed the border at 4:35. Afterwards, a large number of soldiers came one after another. After being disarmed by the French border guards, they were sent to the detention camp in Brouilla for temporary accommodation. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Perpignan
Last night, 4,500 Spanish cavalrymen, with special permission from the French authorities, entered French territory. The rest will cross the border into France soon. 5,000 foreign volunteers are now gathered three miles from the border and will enter France after arrangements have been agreed upon. 240 of them have already entered the country, mostly Portuguese. General Franco has notified the French authorities here that he has withdrawn the Italian volunteer divisions approaching the French border, so as to relieve France's concerns. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Perpignan
After the Spanish Nationalist Army occupied Girona last Saturday, they continued to advance, heading straight for Figueres, only 20 kilometers from the French border. The residents of that city have begun to evacuate again. The government army is retreating towards the French border, preparing to disarm and enter French territory. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)
Difficult Mediation by Britain and France: Divergent Opinions Within the Spanish Government
(London) French Ambassador Corbin visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this morning to discuss the recent situation in Spain. According to British diplomatic circles, the British and French governments have maintained close contact and are willing to do everything in their power to promote the cessation of senseless bloodshed in Spain. The large number of Spanish refugees and soldiers seeking refuge in France has placed a heavy burden on the country, which was also discussed with the Foreign Secretary. However, he declined to specify whether a concrete plan for mediating the civil war had been formulated. According to well-informed sources, although the proposal to end the civil war in Spain has been put forward, the Spanish Nationalist Army has won a complete victory on the Catalan front, and many of the Spanish Republican government authorities have sought refuge in France. Under these circumstances, attempts at "mediation" are bound to be difficult. For example, the terms of peace proposed yesterday by Negrín, the Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican government, are rumored to have been rejected by General Franco, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army. Although this has not been officially confirmed, it is to be expected. Generally speaking, the British government is willing to contact both parties involved in the Spanish civil war as soon as an opportunity arises, in order to study the future situation in that country. This is foreseeable. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

(London) French Ambassador Corbin visited the Foreign Office this morning. The discussion was mainly about mediating the civil war in Spain. According to well-informed sources, Del Vayo, the Foreign Minister of the Spanish Republican government, had a meeting with Henri, the French Ambassador to Spain, and Stephenson, the British Chargé d'Affaires to Spain, yesterday. It is reported that Foreign Minister Del Vayo requested that the United Kingdom and France propose peace to General Franco, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army. The conditions are: (1) both sides should cease hostilities; (2) the territorial integrity of Spain should be maintained; (3) the Nationalist Army should abandon all means of retaliation. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

(Paris) The British and French governments are constantly consulting on the issue of ending the Spanish civil war, but they have encountered considerable difficulties. Since France has no representative stationed in Burgos, Spain, and has recently sent the moderate senator Peral, it can only be regarded as the starting point for establishing relations between France and the Spanish Nationalist government. Therefore, it is very difficult for France to mediate between the two parties in the Spanish civil war. Moreover, the opinions among the authorities of the Spanish Republican government are quite inconsistent, which is also one of the reasons why the United Kingdom and France have failed to respond quickly to the situation. Originally, Azaña, the President of the Republican government, who has always been known as a representative of the bourgeoisie, advocated ending the war. However, Negrín, the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, insisted on continuing the war. President Azaña has now taken refuge in France and will come to Paris in a short period of time. However, it is unknown what plans Prime Minister Negrín has. In addition, people from the Spanish Nationalist Army here claim that General Miaja, the commander of the central region of the government army (whose headquarters are in Madrid), is negotiating with a certain general of the Nationalist Army. However, people from the Republican government have denied this. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Czech-Hungarian Conflict Rises Again
Hungary
The semi-official Hungarian News Agency in the capital recently issued a message stating that Czech soldiers stationed on the heights of the village of Lamovitz on the border of that country had repeatedly machine-gunned the Hungarian city of Angvar as many as four times in the past 24 hours. The Hungarian military authorities have protested to the Czech border defense officers. (Havas, 5th)

Italian Volunteers Not Going to the French Border
(Paris) The right-wing "L'Intransigeant" carried a dispatch from its correspondent stationed in Perpignan, stating that according to semi-official sources, the northward advance of the Italian volunteer army under the Spanish Nationalist Army will stop at Girona. After that, Spanish troops will be sent to the area close to the French border in order to completely occupy Catalonia. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Burgos
Regarding the visit of French Moderate Senator Peral to hold talks with the Nationalist authorities, it is rumored that the Nationalist government has provided him with assurances, stating that Catalonia and the foreign troops on the front lines will never approach the French border. Peral has neither confirmed nor denied this statement. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Chamberlain Warns: Britain and France Cooperate Closely
If France's Vital Interests are Threatened, the United Kingdom Will Defend Them with All its Strength
(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Henderson, a member of the opposition Labour Party, asked Prime Minister Chamberlain about the relationship between the United Kingdom and France. French Foreign Minister Bonnet recently stated in the House of Deputies, "If a war breaks out in the future, the United Kingdom will assist France with all its forces, just as France will assist the United Kingdom with all its forces. This statement is in line with the views of the British government." Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "As far as I know, Foreign Minister Bonnet said that if the United Kingdom and France are both involved in a war in the future, the United Kingdom will assist France with all its forces, just as France will assist the United Kingdom with all its forces. This is completely consistent with the views of the British government. Although it is difficult to predict all the events that may occur in the future, since the interests of the United Kingdom and France are the same, if the vital interests of France are threatened, no matter where this threat comes from, the United Kingdom must cooperate with France immediately. This is what I should make clear." All the members applauded in approval. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Italian Extortion Again on the Issue of Withdrawing Volunteers: The Nationalist Army's Intention is Still Insufficient, Saying That Political Victory Must Be Obtained First
(London) The Balearic Islands in the Spanish Mediterranean, which are centered on Mallorca and Menorca, have been controlled by Italy on Mallorca, which is now in the hands of the Nationalist Army, for more than a day. Menorca, however, is still held by the Spanish Republican government. According to a dispatch from the Rome correspondent of The Times, "According to recent signs, Menorca is likely to become Italy's second target. The Italian Air Force stationed in Mallorca flew over Menorca yesterday, dropping leaflets advising residents to surrender to the Nationalist Army. The Italian newspapers' correspondents in Spain are quite optimistic about this, believing that the Nationalist Army will not encounter major resistance if it attacks Menorca. However, the actual situation is not so simple. Menorca's defenses are very strong. If the Nationalist Army's fleet blockades the island from the sea, it is also difficult to enter the island's territorial waters within three nautical miles. However, French ships, under the cover of their warships, can easily sail to the island to refuel. Therefore, Menorca not only has the potential to resist stubbornly, but also can cause new disputes between France and Italy. The impact of this delicate situation is unimaginable." (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Rome
After a two-hour meeting on Saturday night, the Fascist Supreme Council issued a communiqué stating that Italian volunteers would not withdraw from Spain until the Nationalist Army had achieved complete victory. Yesterday, all Italian newspapers unanimously praised this communiqué. "Il Popolo d'Italia" published an article by Mr. Gayda, stating that the Fascist Supreme Council discussed diplomatic events on Saturday night. At that time, the world was waiting for the remarks of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to end the forum started by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and German leader Hitler. At that time, there was indeed a speech, but it was only for the reference of those attending the Supreme Council and not for public criticism. In this article, Gayda attacked President Roosevelt extensively, saying that since the omnipotent state has been repeatedly attacked, it can only reorganize its army and prepare to defend itself. Italy is prepared to defend itself with all the power of itself and its comrade state, Germany. German leader Hitler has repeatedly stated in his recent speeches that Germany and Italy are united not only in ideology and politics, but also militarily. Gayda also published an article in "Il Giornale d'Italia," stating that the Italian troops fighting in Spain will not withdraw until the Red Army and its friends have completely eliminated their destructive forces. The Red Army is currently engaged in reorganization in the area bordering Spain and is receiving shelter and assistance. Therefore, the victory of General Franco cannot be said to be complete until the final work of eliminating the Red Army in Spain and the bordering area has been implemented. Now, new diplomatic pressure and interference are in progress in order to harm the Spanish Nationalist Army. Therefore, Germany and Italy cannot withdraw their assistance to Franco. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

(London) Mr. Geyda, a famous Italian reporter who has always been regarded as the mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, commented on the communiqué issued by the Fascist Party's Supreme Council in an article published in "Il Popolo d'Italia" yesterday, stating that Italian volunteers in Spain must obtain a political victory in addition to a military victory for the Spanish Nationalist Army before they can be withdrawn. British politicians have paid close attention to this and said that when Prime Minister Chamberlain visited Rome last month, Prime Minister Mussolini assured him that Italian volunteers would be completely withdrawn as soon as the Spanish civil war ended. Mr. Geyda's words are in contradiction with this assurance. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

(London) Mr. Geyda, a famous Italian reporter, published an article in "Il Popolo d'Italia" yesterday, which has had a reaction in Britain. Geyda's comments on the communiqué issued by the Fascist Party's Supreme Council, stating that Italian volunteers in Spain must obtain a political victory in addition to a military victory for the Spanish Nationalist Army before they can be withdrawn, etc., have been commented on by "The Daily Telegraph" (formerly known as the organ of former Foreign Secretary Eden), stating, "The political victory that Geyda is talking about refers to eradicating all 'inappropriate forces' within Spain and eliminating the 'Red Army' in the neighboring area (meaning France). However, it is impossible to predict when this kind of political victory will be achieved. Isn't it the case that Italian volunteers will occupy Spain for a long time? Based on this, what we have said before about the dictators' intervention in the Spanish civil war is not so much due to ideological reasons, but rather to strategic reasons for opposing France. The main goal is to weaken France's position in the Mediterranean in order to realize what Hitler wrote in his book 'Mein Kampf' about destroying French military power. Now, Geyda's words make us feel more convinced. However, Foreign Secretary Halifax said in the House of Commons yesterday, while acknowledging the tension in relations between France and Italy, that the relationship between Britain and Italy is still optimistic. It is difficult to understand this. The interests of France are largely consistent with those of Britain. The loss of lips and teeth is painful and related. Now that Italy is openly threatening France, how can the British government be complacent and say that it is on good terms with Italy? The dictators aim to separate Britain and France. It should be known that after France declines, Britain will immediately lose its natural ally. If that is the case, then those dictators will make the same harsh demands on Britain. This can be asserted." (Havas, 7th)

Japanese Submarine Sinks a Ship, Killing 81 Sailors
(Tokyo) According to the Navy today, of the submarine I-63 that sank four days ago, four sailors have been rescued. 81 others are still missing. The previous report of more than 40 people was a rumor. These people have been lurking underwater for four days and are probably hopeless. Outsiders are surprised by the large number of sailors on Japanese submarines, because submarines in other countries do not have so many people. However, Japanese submarines often have many trainees on the deck, so the number of people is naturally higher than in other countries. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Indian National Congress: Increasingly Left-Leaning, with a Strong Attitude Towards Britain
Jairabagri, India
The political conference of the Bengal National Congress yesterday passed a resolution asking the All-India Congress to submit an aide-mémoire to the British government, limiting the British government to provide a substantial response to the demands of the Indian people within six months. If no response is received within six months or no satisfactory results are obtained, then the National Congress can freely take any action. The resolution also stated that India has the right to create its own constitution through a constitutional conference, and reiterated its firm opposition to the federal system. Since the election of left-leaning leader Bose as chairman of the Indian National Congress Party, the left-leaning forces have become increasingly strong. Now that this resolution has been passed, the National Congress's opposition to the federation is even stronger. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Yugoslavia Forms New Cabinet, Cooperating with Croats
The capital of Yugoslavia
After the resignation of the cabinet of Yugoslavian Prime Minister Stojadinović, Prince Paul, the Regent, ordered Dr. Cvijović, a member of the Radical Union and former Minister of Social Affairs, to form a new cabinet. It has now been established and the list is as follows:
Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Cvijović, Minister of Foreign Affairs Magovac (new), Minister of National Defense Nedić (incumbent), Minister of Transportation Spaho (incumbent), Minister of Finance Titerja (new), Minister of Commerce Tomić (new), Minister of Public Works Krek (incumbent), Minister of Forestry and Mines Pantić (new), Minister of Social Welfare Nagagović (new), Minister of Agriculture Bećirić (new), Minister of Justice Ružić (new), Minister of Education Ciriljić (new), Minister of Posts Atiba Magovac (new), Minister of Health Ćuvić (new), Ministers without Portfolio: Gurunović (Bosnian), Maštrović (Croat), Snoji (incumbent), Milčić (incumbent).

There are 12 new members. Serbs account for six people, Croats account for two people, Bosnians account for two people, and Slovenes account for two people. Politicians believe that the new cabinet will maintain the old diplomatic policy, while seeking good cooperation with the Croats in internal affairs, because the resignation of the previous cabinet was caused by the opposition of that ethnic group.

The capital of Yugoslavia
Cvijović, chairman of the Radical Union's parliamentary party, was ordered to form a new cabinet. He led all the cabinet members to swear in this morning. The new prime minister then issued a statement to the newspapers, stating that the policy of the new cabinet can be explained mainly by the reasons for the resignation of the five members of the previous cabinet. In other words, the new cabinet wants to cooperate with Maček, the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, the opposition party, so that a comprehensive and long-lasting agreement can be reached between the Serbian and Croatian ethnic groups. The new cabinet is composed of representatives from various ethnic groups. There are 11 Serbs, 2 Slovenes, 2 Croats, and 2 Muslims. Among them, 7 former cabinet members remained in their positions.

The implementation of this plan is limited to British and European people. As for non-European people, who are mostly Chinese and Indians, they will serve in the air defense organization.

However, it can be predicted that the situation in China will require Japanese troops to be stationed for a long period of time. This has been stated repeatedly. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### Four Hundred and Eighty-Two Tianjin Citizens Jointly Appeal to the British Ambassador

Expressing Their Determination to Support the Government and Supreme Leader

Willing to Endure All Hardships to Support the Sacred War of Resistance

The British Ambassador Has Arrived in Ping from Tianjin

Hong Kong, Tianjin News. Four hundred and eighty-two Tianjin citizens, on the 4th, jointly sent a letter to British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr to welcome him and express their respect for his decision to come north. The letter also expressed the will of the people of North China and their hopes for Britain. The original letter reads: "Mr. Clark Kerr, we are citizens of Tianjin. We sincerely welcome and pay our respects to the British Ambassador, who has taken the trouble to travel far to Tianjin for inspection. Mr. Ambassador, you have taken the first step into North China, and we are very pleased because you can represent the British government and people in observing North China after Japan launched its war of aggression. Your understanding can be more accurate. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Japan has been trampling on our territory, killing our compatriots, destroying our construction, and expelling European and American businesses. You must have received many reports on all these facts from your country's consulates and garrisons. Recently, Japan has been clamoring to abolish the concessions, and has even implemented a blockade of the Tianjin concessions. A visit to the surrounding areas of the concessions will reveal the serious plight of hundreds of thousands of Chinese and foreign residents, and over a thousand of your country's troops within the British concession. Today, we will no longer provide you with any further information, but simply offer a few points to express the attitude of the people of North China and our hopes for you.

First, we support our government and our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. We are willing to endure all hardships to support the sacred War of Resistance until China drives out the enemy and achieves final victory. The people of North China will never surrender to Japan, nor will they recognize any puppet organizations fostered by Japan. In order to cover up their robber behavior and numb the hearts of the Chinese people, the Japanese warlords have hired a small number of traitors to serve as puppet officials. However, these traitors are all dregs that our government and people have long abandoned. Therefore, their actions can never represent the will of the Chinese people. You may know that in the first month of this year alone, the people of North China secretly remitted national donations through Tianjin to the interior, ultimately going to Chongqing. There have already been 120 batches. Since the start of the war, the people of North China have been remitting donations to our government every month. These donations are collected from the poor and the rich, residents, merchants, workers, students, women, and laborers of North China. We are only explaining the fact that we support the government, support Chairman Chiang, and support the War of Resistance. There are many more facts that can naturally illustrate our will, but this is just one of them. Regarding the recent 'peace movement' promoted by the Japanese side, we would like to make a statement. China has always been a peace-loving nation, and love of peace is our virtue. After the September 18th Incident, Japan occupied our four northeastern provinces, and then forced us to sign the Tanggu Truce, invading Chahar, northern Hebei and eastern Hebei, and creating the Hebei Incident. The Chinese government has repeatedly endured humiliation and swallowed its anger to the extent that it could tolerate. Now, the war has broken out, and it is Japan that has forced us to rise up and resist, and to fight for survival. Therefore, the people are willing to endure all the hardships and pain to support the government in fighting to the end, until victory. This proves that the recent so-called 'peace movement' has no popular support whatsoever and is entirely directed by puppet organizations instigated by Japan. Second, we would like to ask you to believe that in the past year and seven months, Japan has spent all its manpower, resources, and firepower, only to occupy nine cities and towns on the railways in North China. In other words, Japan does not have the ability to occupy the cities and villages outside the transportation lines. The majority of North China's territory, these villages and countryside, is still under the jurisdiction of our government. We have the strength to defend and have not fallen into enemy hands. Moreover, these areas have gradually expanded to the transportation lines. Until recently, in Beiping, there are already 10,000 fully armed soldiers of our army. On the border of Rehe and Chahar, there are 10,000 people. Between the Jinpu and Pinghan lines in Hebei Province, there are tens of thousands of people. In the Jin-Ji-Cha border area, there are tens of thousands of people. Throughout Ji Dong, Ji Nan, Lu Bei, and Lu Xi, there is not a single county that is completely occupied by the Japanese army. As for the entire Shanxi Province and northern Henan, there is no place that is not covered with our organized and heroic national army. Another fact further proves that Japan is unable to govern any occupied area. The "United Reserve Bank" counterfeit currency issued by the Japanese side is only used in a small number of cities on the railway lines. Ten miles outside the railway lines, the counterfeit currency becomes waste paper. All this also proves that the people of North China will never submit to Japan and the puppet organizations. Third, we hope that our friendly country, Britain, for the sake of justice, humanity, world peace, and British interests in the Far East, will give us more sympathy for China's War of Resistance. We believe that China's own national strength can defeat Japan alone. Our belief is the same as that of our officers and soldiers on the battlefield, and the people in the rear, and is no different from what you have seen in Chongqing and Kunming: Japan's stubborn invasion will inevitably fail, and China's just War of Resistance will ultimately be victorious. However, we know that if China fights Japan alone, the final victory will certainly belong to China, but the process will be extremely painful. If we have to wait until we completely defeat Japan with our own strength, Britain's commerce in the Far East will probably be completely destroyed by Japan first. Mr. Ambassador, you are a friend of China, and one of the British people most sympathetic to China. We dare to ask you, after this visit to North China, to more enthusiastically appeal to your country on behalf of China, and to use all the great sympathy that your country can give us. This is not only to help China, but also to safeguard your country's interests in the Far East. Finally, we feel ashamed that this is your first visit to Tianjin, but we cannot see our government agencies to give you a grand welcome. However, we believe that in two or three years at most, when you revisit Tianjin, you should be able to see the Chinese national flag with the blue sky and white sun everywhere, and receive a grand reception from our government. We wish you a healthy journey. Four hundred and eighty-two Tianjin citizens (signatures) (6th dispatch)"

### Anti-War Sentiment Rises in Japan

Small Groups Established in the Invading Chinese Troops, Mutiny Once Occurred in Dagu

Tunxi: Recently, among Japanese officers and soldiers in the Jinghu area, anti-war sentiment has become increasingly strong. A few days ago, more than 500 Japanese soldiers in Jiangyin mutinied due to their anti-war sentiments, killing the Japanese commander and setting fire to the headquarters, causing great shock to the Japanese military headquarters. They considered transferring the Japanese garrison in Wuxi to encircle and suppress the mutiny. A sudden clash occurred, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. Currently, all the leaders of the anti-war officers and soldiers have been arrested and executed, and the remaining officers and soldiers have been ordered to disband completely. (6th dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The situation of a mutiny by more than 3,000 Japanese soldiers in Dagu. On the 21st of last month, two Japanese warships transported more than 3,000 Japanese army soldiers from the front lines of Central and Southern China from Shanghai and arrived at Dagu Port. The next day, the troops suddenly mutinied. According to the investigation, the Japanese troops departed from Shanghai by ship. When they departed, the Japanese military commander gave a speech, saying that they were ordered by the "General Headquarters" to return home for rest and reorganization. The Japanese troops initially felt fortunate to have survived, but who knew that the Japanese warship they were on did not sail to Japan but arrived at Dagu Port. At this point, they began to suspect and sent representatives to question the captain of the ship about why they did not sail directly back to their country. The captain of the ship replied that he had received a secret order from "General Headquarters," stating that the guerrillas in Shanxi Province were active, and this part of the army had to be temporarily delayed in returning home and transferred to Shanxi Province for reinforcement. The Japanese soldiers were in uproar upon hearing this. Some said that the captain's words were not credible, and some said that the Japanese authorities had clearly deceived the soldiers. Despite the captain's repeated appeasement and telegraphing to Tokyo for instructions, they soon received a reply from "General Headquarters," still strongly ordering them to land at Dagu Port and proceed to Jin-Sui. On the 22nd, the Japanese captain, together with the Japanese army officer, announced the "General Headquarters" reply and gently exhorted the soldiers to obey the order of the "Grand Marshal." The Japanese soldiers all turned angry and clashed, opening fire. The order was in great chaos for a time. Previously, the Japanese captain had transferred four surveillance ships near the pier for vigilance. Hearing the sound, they were greatly alarmed and immediately opened fire to suppress the mutinous ships. It is not known that the Japanese army was stationed at the Dagu pier. Seeing the Japanese warship firing at the pier, they thought that the Japanese navy intended to provoke the army and also returned fire at the attacking Japanese warship. For a time, the sound of artillery rumbled, and the Chinese guerrillas thought that the Japanese army and the Chinese army were in fierce battle and sent many people to support them. At this point, a mixed battle occurred for a long time, and there were casualties on both sides. Afterwards, the Japanese military officer transferred the gendarmerie and another unit to Dagu Port to suppress the rebellion, and still forcibly ordered the mutinous troops to land and transported them to the front lines of Jin-Sui in two batches. This shows the intensity of the Japanese army's anti-war sentiment. (5th dispatch)

(Moscow) Red Star Newspaper reported: "A crisis has now occurred in the Japanese army. The anti-war sentiment of its soldiers is generally high, and the combat effectiveness of the army has been weakened. Heavy losses have been suffered on the front line. This anti-war sentiment has become more and more obvious after the Japanese soldiers realized that the occupation of Guangzhou and Wuhan cannot determine the outcome of the war, and the so-called 'China Incident' has become a protracted war. Recently, leaflets urging them to surrender to the Chinese army have been found on the bodies of Japanese soldiers who died in battle and were captured. The Japanese Anti-War League has established small groups everywhere in the invading Chinese army. Although anti-war acts will be severely punished, soldiers are still happy to join these small groups and other anti-war organizations. Many desperate soldiers who have no way out commit suicide. The anti-war acts in the Japanese army are part of the increasingly high anti-war movement in Japan. Japanese soldiers, like all the people, realize that war only leads them to poverty and bankruptcy. In the past year, more than 300,000 people have been arrested in Japan for anti-war activities, which is enough to prove the size of this movement. The rear of the Japanese warlords has become increasingly shaken, Japan's national strength has become increasingly exhausted, and the Japanese army is in a dangerous situation, while China is becoming stronger and more united as it fights, and will resolutely counterattack the invaders."

The United States Ships War Necessities to Japan

### The Financial Market Remains Stable, Various Industries Concluding Their Annual Accounts; Decisive Ability to Weather the Year Due to Abnormal Post-War Development; No Interest Paid on Deposits in Various Native Banks after the Thirteenth

The Shanghai Native Bankers' Association resolved that February 18th would be the closing date for the 27th fiscal year; thereafter, various industries began to handle the final closing of accounts. The collection and settlement of funds by silver and native banks is gradually becoming busy. Because of the abnormal development of various industries in the Shanghai market after the war, there is no question about weathering the end of the year. The financial market remains as stable as ever. The details are as follows:

Native Banks Begin to Handle the Final Closing of Accounts; Members of the Native Bankers' Association

43 native banks

have all been ordered to handle the final closing of accounts. Settlements have been handled separately with various client accounts, and interest on deposits will be calculated up to February 13th, and in accordance with the resolution of the Association, at the rate of 3.1%. No interest will be paid on deposits after the 13th, but overdue interest will continue to accrue. The market call money rate will be calculated up to the 17th. From today, various banks will extend their office hours according to the busyness of their business, and will take a four-day holiday starting from February 19th to organize everything, and will open for business on the 23rd.

Various Industries Prepare to Weather the End of the Year; Because the final closing date for the 27th fiscal year

is approaching in an instant,

various industries have separately begun to handle the final closing of accounts. They have separately sent personnel to collect outstanding accounts, so that they can be recovered in full before the final closing of accounts. The managers of various companies, firms, and factories have separately allocated funds in order to weather the end of the year safely. If goods are mortgaged to banks for cash to repay debts owed to various native banks, various native banks will suspend all new loans because the final closing of accounts is approaching. From yesterday, due to the final closing of accounts, the collection and settlement of funds by silver and native banks is gradually becoming busy.

### Remittances from Various Locations are Paid Out by the General Office

Designated Counters for Payment; Recipients of Remittances Should Pay Attention

Since the outbreak of the war, various industries and factories have moved to the interior, and the center of trade has also shifted from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Moreover, because various places have successively fallen into war zones, many people have taken refuge in Shanghai. However, remittances from various places to Shanghai have not decreased. However, the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau stipulates that all remittances to Shanghai from various places must be presented to the General Office on North Suzhou Road with the ticket for collection, and no branch offices will make payments. However, because people from all walks of life are not familiar with the situation in the Bureau, even if they go to the post office, they are still clueless, which is inconvenient for both parties. The counters for payment of remittances from various places to Shanghai and the office hours are listed below: (A) Payment Counters, (1) No. 21 Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hunan, (2) No. 13 Henan, Hebei (excluding Tianjin), Beiping area, Beiping General Branch (excluding), Hankou, Wuchang, and Hubei telegraphic transfers, (3) No. 24 Anhui, Jiangxi, Xinjiang, Hubei (excluding Hankou, Wuchang, and Hubei telegraphic transfers), (4) No. 15 Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu, Guizhou, Tianjin, Nanjing Branch, (5) No. 26 Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, Nanjing, Badong, Dongchuan, (6) No. 28 Jiang Office (excluding Nanjing General Branch), Shanghai. (B) No. 20 and No. 22, issuing drafts and telegraphic transfers from various provinces, cities, and counties. (C) The office hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day except Sunday.

### The Hua Army in Northern Jiangsu Has Completed Its Equipment; Will Besiege the Japanese Army Along the Coast; Japanese Warships Shelling, Japanese Aircraft Exerting Efforts to Reconnoiter

The Hua Army guerrillas in four counties in northern Jiangsu, including Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, and Chongming, have been ordered by Gu Zhutong, commander of the Third War Zone of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, to be reorganized by Li Mingyang of the 24th Army Group. Sun Xinfu, the commander of the 5th Banner Brigade, has reorganized the original guerrilla leaders of the counties, including Ding Jutang, Yan Xiuwu, and Zhang Nengren, into a regular Hua Army, which is being trained day and night and has become a strong force. The troops in each county have been fully equipped, and ammunition has been replenished. The hundreds of Japanese troops entrenched in Qinglonggang and inside and outside the ×× three factories and along the coast of Nantong City have been heavily surrounded by the Hua Army. The battle has already taken place in Qinglonggang a few days ago. Because the Japanese army's reinforcements were insufficient, they retreated immediately. Japanese warships constantly shelled various villages along the coast, and three or four Japanese naval reconnaissance aircraft flew around the coastal ports every day to reconnoiter the location of the Hua Army, and the situation was quite tense. According to people from Haimen, the troops of Yan Xiuwu, commander of the 10th Regiment of the 5th Brigade of the 24th Army Group, have arrived at Daxin Port, only seven or eight miles away from Qinglonggang. Zhang Nengren is advancing towards ×× three factories in the Songji Port area, forming a siege. The battle is about to break out.

### Japanese Warships Arbitrarily Search Merchant Vessels; Business of Various Ships on the Yangtze River Sharply Reduced; Temporary Suspension of Procurement and Transportation of Merchant Loans in Various Industries in the Interior; Tourists are Sparse and the Market is Depressed in Various Towns Along the Coast

Recently, several Japanese warships have been arbitrarily searching merchant vessels on the Yangtze River's downstream ports and shores, looting goods, and obstructing them in every possible way. After the business of various foreign merchant ships has been sharply reduced, the Japanese puppets have again greatly squeezed and increased taxes. Merchants have stopped procurement and transportation, and the market is extremely depressed in various towns along the coast. The various situations are recorded as follows:

Searching Foreign Ships; The Japanese side, because the war in southern Guangdong is tight, has transferred the Japanese troops stationed in the interior to the front lines for reinforcements, so the troops are becoming increasingly thin. They are deeply afraid that the Chinese army will take the opportunity to attack, and they are implementing rear pacification work. From the 1st of this month, several Japanese warships have been dispatched to anchor in various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to conduct searches. All foreign merchant ships, regardless of nationality, are checked. In addition to questioning tourists about their origins, the goods loaded in the bottom of the cabin are also inspected one by one. Therefore, after various foreign ships have been obstructed by the Japanese army, the cargo and passengers have been reduced, and each shift is losing heavily.

Suspension of Procurement and Transportation; According to the Modern News Agency reporter's inquiry yesterday to various transportation companies stationed in Shanghai, since the Japanese puppets have implemented increased taxes, the "business tax" is 4% of the value, the "county affairs" tax is 2 to 4% of the value, and in addition, there is another 20% of the handling fee and 20% of the customs loss. Therefore, various industries and merchants, suffering from this illegal squeeze, are mostly unwilling to procure goods. Now, the branch companies in various ports in the interior have successively notified the Shanghai company to postpone the shipment of goods from Shanghai to the interior, and jointly negotiate with the Japanese puppet tax "agencies" to reduce the tax.

Depressed Ports; Yesterday, according to merchants from the interior who came to Shanghai, the markets of various ports along the Yangtze River, such as Hudu, Changyinsha, and Xingang, have been abnormally developed in the past. Merchants from all over the world gathered, and the value of goods entering and leaving each port every day was tens of millions of yuan. The Japanese puppet taxes were already considerable, but they were still not satisfied, and they even increased the exorbitant taxes. The burden on merchants' goods has increased, and the economy of the people in the interior has been exhausted after being searched by the Japanese, and the purchasing power is weak. The business of various industries is light, so the markets of various towns along the Yangtze River have been depressed recently, and are no longer as prosperous as before.

British Army Commander

Scheduled to Leave Shanghai

The English-language "Ta Mei Evening News" stated that Major General Smallett, commander of the British Army stationed in Shanghai, will officially leave Shanghai on the 11th of this month and end his command of the British Army in Shanghai. The military honor guards of various countries stationed in Shanghai and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will review Major General Smallett at the Luma Hall baseball exercise on that day, and then leave by car. Smallett's friends will also be present to see him off. Also, tomorrow (7th) morning at 10:45, Smallett will call on the chairman of the Public Works Department, Fan Keling, to bid farewell.

### China's Finances Have Laid the Foundation for Victory in the War of Resistance; China's Debt Per Person is Approximately Ten Yuan; Japan's Debt Per Person is Nearly Three Hundred Yuan

According to a foreign economist, since the Lugouqiao Incident, China's full-scale War of Resistance has lasted for more than eighteen months, and its financial position has always been stable and consolidated. The economist highly praised the Chinese authorities' efforts to handle finances, adjust taxes, promote international trade, and stabilize the currency system since the War of Resistance, saying that the economic adjustments have laid the foundation for victory in the War of Resistance. The economist compared the current debts of China and Japan, with China's total debt being 600 billion yuan and Japan's total debt being 1.8 trillion yen. Based on these figures, China's debt per person is 13 yuan, and Japan's debt per person is 260 yen.

### The Leading Position of the Hardware Market Has Shifted from Shanghai to Hong Kong; Shanghai's Transportation with the Interior is Blocked; Copper for the Interior is Obtained from Hong Kong; The Resources Committee is Making Every Effort to Mine Copper Mines

Shanghai has always been the concentration market for hardware trading in our country. Moreover, because most of the required copper is imported from foreign countries, domestic copper prices often rise and fall with Shanghai, and Shanghai depends on the London market. However, since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai's industrial foundation has been severely damaged, resulting in a sharp reduction in copper consumption. At the same time, Shanghai's transportation with the interior is blocked. The copper required for domestic industrial and military purposes will be mostly procured in Hong Kong. Shanghai has almost lost its leading position in the hardware market, and Shanghai's prices can no longer represent the trend of the copper market in our country. At the same time, because transportation to the interior is difficult and the import of foreign copper is inconvenient, the supply of copper is insufficient, and copper prices are not as stable as in Shanghai.

Copper Producing Areas in Various Provinces of the Country

Copper is the most

important

material in the

electrical industry,

and its application is extremely wide. Pure copper can be used to make electric wires for trams, telephones, and telegraphs, and other industrial machinery. An alloy of copper and zinc is called brass, which is used to manufacture screws, round rods, clock parts, and cartridge shells. The copper producing areas in the country are Hubei, Yunnan, Sichuan, and other provinces, with a total area of 4.76 million acres. Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou produce 500 tons per year, with Yunnan producing the most copper. Sichuan and Guizhou produce less, and the remaining provinces such as Hubei, Gansu, and Shanxi produce less.

Jointly Forming the Dianbei

Mining Bureau

Dongchuan

Copper Mine is

currently our country's

largest copper

producing area.

The mining area is located in the northwest of Dongchuan County, divided into five major factories: Tangdan, Luoxue, Dashui, Maolu, and Tiezhang. The first four factories are all located in the northeast of the Jinsha River, while Tiezhang is located in the west of the Jinsha River, adjacent to Huali, Sichuan. The mine has always been government-run. Since its establishment, it has been more than 300 years. It is now managed by the Yunnan Provincial Government and named Dongchuan Mining Co., Ltd. Until September of last year, the Resources Committee and Yunnan Province jointly established the Dianbei Mining Bureau to handle the mining, smelting, transportation, and sales of copper mines and other mineral products in the northern part of the province, and used all the assets of Dongchuan as part of the government's investment.

Organizing Sichuan

Peng County Copper Mine

Sichuan Peng

County Copper

Mine is

the largest producer

in Sichuan,

and the second largest copper producing area in our country. The mining area is located in the northwest of Baishuihe Village. Since the Republic of China, it has still been government-run. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, it was changed to government supervision and commercial operation. In the twenty-second year, it was completely shut down due to financial difficulties and poor production. Now, the Resources Committee has sent personnel to organize and prepare for construction. According to the estimates of the Beiping Geological Survey Institute, the copper mine has reserves of more than 100,000 tons. The current organization method is to first unify the organization and rectify its internal affairs in terms of management. In terms of mining and smelting, light railways or aerial tramways are built between the mining area and the factory to solve the difficulty of transporting.

Taking Over Hubei

Daxin Xianfeng

Hubei's important

copper mines are

Daxin and

Xianfeng.

Daxin Copper Mine refers to the copper mines in Daye and Yangxin counties. The ore veins are widely distributed. Those in Daye are Longjia Mountain and Hongshankou, 40 miles southwest of the county, and those in Yangxin are Ouyang Mountain and Niushou Mountain, all 50 miles northwest of the county. After being closed down since the ninth year of the Republic of China, it is now state-owned, and the Resources Committee is trying to take over. Xianfeng Copper Mine starts from Yangti, which is adjacent to the border of Sichuan in the west, and ends at Dashanping in Xuansi County in the east, totaling 200 miles in length. It is currently being mined by locals using indigenous methods. A company has been organized, but unfortunately, it was terminated due to banditry.

### Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Passenger Shipping Implements Guarantee System; Strictly Prevent Strong Men from Leaving the Country and Spies from Infiltrating; Zhejiang Provincial Government Orders the Formation of a Japanese Goods Inspection Team

Eastern Zhejiang's Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and other ports have already implemented defense,

Strictly restricting the entry and exit of ships; Ningbo, Jiao, Ou,

Various rivers and counties have formed Japanese goods inspection teams to strictly

Prevent Japanese goods from infiltrating. After direct Shanghai-Ningbo shipping is permitted,

Passengers are subject to a guarantee system, and measures are taken to prevent strong men

From fleeing. However, the inspection and prohibition affect local goods, and exports

Decline sharply. Details are as follows:

Passenger Hall Provides Guarantees

Ningbo Garrison

Headquarters

Notifies all shipping

Companies that

Specially approved ships operating direct Shanghai-Ningbo routes may

Carry passengers, but passengers traveling from Shanghai to Ningbo

Must have a guarantee from a reputable merchant and attach

Two half-length photos of themselves. The Sino-Italian Company's De

Ping vessel is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 8th, initially implementing

A passenger guarantee system. Other vessels operating direct Shanghai-Ningbo routes

Include the American Company's Metta vessel, Jardine Matheson's Moufu vessel, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tangsai vessel, Weir & Han Company's Xin'an

Na vessel, and Butterfield & Swire Company's New Beijing vessel,

Strictly Prevent Strong Men from Fleeing

Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and other

Places strictly prevent

Strong men from leaving the country,

Therefore, for export

Passengers, those of draftable age must

Possess a certificate to be allowed to export; otherwise, they will

Be prohibited. It is also stipulated that ships operating Shanghai,

Taizhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, etc., are not allowed to dock at

Chumen, Shipu, Xiangshan, Dinghai, Ninghai.

Small ships operating Chumen, Dinghai, Shipu, Xiangshan, Ninghai

Are not allowed to sail to other ports, aiming to

Prevent strong men from leaving the country privately. Those traveling from Shanghai to

Zhejiang to purchase goods and collect customer accounts

Must obtain a certificate from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.

Establish Japanese Goods Inspection Teams

The Zhejiang Provincial

Government orders various

Counties to establish

Japanese goods inspection teams

To prevent Japanese goods from being disguised and dumped. They will be

Organized by each county government, county party headquarters, water police, anti-enemy

Association, police bureau, and county chamber of commerce, with each of these six institutions

And organizations assigning one to three people.

If it is discovered that Japanese goods are being used to impersonate domestic or foreign goods,

The goods will be confiscated, and the merchants who transport them

Will be severely punished. Currently, Dinghai, Haimen, Ning

Bo, Wenzhou, and other counties have successively established

Japanese goods inspection teams, formulating specific

Measures for punishing the seizure of Japanese goods.

Cargo Exports Sharply Decline

Since the Zhejiang Customs

Received orders to prohibit

Pomelos, timber,

Tea,

Cotton, native paper, fresh eggs, hemp, silk,

And 54 other items from being exported to Shanghai,

The local goods from the three places of Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang are

Piling up and unable to be transported to Shanghai for sale. Although various industries have sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance

And the Ministry of Economic Affairs to provide accommodation and assistance,

The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have not yet approved the transportation to Shanghai. Therefore,

Ships operating between Shanghai and eastern Zhejiang are affected by the prohibition, and

Cargo transportation has declined sharply. As a last resort, they have reduced

The number of ships operating.

Strictly Prohibit Smuggling by Sailing Vessels

The Ningbo Garrison

Headquarters

Believes that recently

Sailing vessels have often

Smuggled goods in and out, and strong men also

Use sailing vessels as a refuge to escape. Therefore, it has specifically

Ordered the coastal county governments under Ningbo's jurisdiction to thoroughly

Suppress and investigate and strictly order inspection teams to

Comply with the prescribed methods and earnestly handle matters.

A Year's Plan Starts in Spring

Making Lifelong Plans for Men Suffering from Kidney Deficiency

Spring has arrived! Spring has indeed stealthily come to the human world. Not only is this the sequence of the seasons, but it can also be seen in the smiles on people's faces, which have been warmed by the sunshine on skin shrunken by the cold. Ah! Spring has truly come! It is indeed cause for surprise! But with the arrival of spring, the year's plan starts in spring, and you should make some plans for your future and happiness at this time. Health is the foundation of our future and happiness. Our grand future must start from this foundation. If health is lost, what is left? This is truly the only important thing for us. But for a man in today's turbulent and erotic society, problems often arise with health. The most common and painful problem is that men discover problems such as kidney deficiency and sexual weakness after marriage. Let us imagine a girl marrying a husband. What is she marrying for? Sexual issues must be resolved through the marital path. This is the proper way. Who does not want to legitimately demand the happiness that life should offer? Therefore, a strong man who marries a girl with such aspirations will have deep love, and their married life will be intimate and sweet, enjoying the legitimate happiness of life. If a man has committed self-abuse and nocturnal emission in his youth or has been dissolute and unrestrained after marriage, the life-and-death glandular fluid that governs the health of the human body will inevitably be depleted, resulting in kidney deficiency and impotence, scattered energy, infertility after prolonged marriage, local atrophy, neurasthenia, etc., so that he often feels dizzy, lightheaded, forgetful, insomniac, has tinnitus and blurred vision, aching back, weak limbs, and feels exhausted after even the slightest effort! Although still young, he already presents a state of decline. Such a man, even if he sits all day and eats, is still dying. How can he compete with others? How can he achieve success in academia and career? Even in marital life, he cannot fulfill the duties that a husband should have, so he is often hated by his wife, creating family tragedies! He may even have no children, leaving a lifelong regret! What meaning does such a life have! Therefore, as the vernal equinox arrives, making a plan for the year is also making a plan for life. Methods must be sought to ensure that this disease is cured as soon as possible. According to world-renowned doctors and my personal experience, it is generally recognized that taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Substance" is the most effective and specific treatment. This medicine can generate semen and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation within one day and night after taking it, and the disease can be alleviated. With continued use, it is sure to cure the above-mentioned symptoms completely in a short period of time. However, those who have nocturnal emissions must also take "Hemetts' Semen-Strengthening Tablets" to consolidate the seminal vesicle and relieve the state of kidney deficiency and nerve hypersensitivity, so that nocturnal emission can be completely cured, and both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, resulting in even more rapid results! The above-mentioned medicines have all been clinically verified by numerous Chinese and foreign doctors, proving their effectiveness is indeed certain and great, so they have long been popular around the world and are sold in all pharmacies. However, if patients can come to this clinic to be diagnosed by expert doctors and receive electrotherapy, injections, and other targeted therapies, a complete cure can be guaranteed.

Common Youth Diseases

### How Does Nocturnal Emission in Spring Affect You?

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

"If the grass is not uprooted, it will sprout again in spring." Although spring is a beautiful and warm season, people with chronic diseases often find that their old diseases recur or even worsen at this time.

Now, let's take nocturnal emission as an example. In winter, because the climate is cold, even if you have an important job at night, you still feel timid. Your feet refuse to stretch straight down, curling up like a hedgehog (sleeping curled up can also reduce nocturnal emissions). At this time, there are fewer dreams, and the chances of temptation are naturally fewer, so the number of emissions is also considerably reduced. But in spring, this is very different. Because spring is the time when all things sprout, it can also be said to be the time when things move from dormancy to stirring. At this time, the weather gradually warms up, there are more spring dreams, and there are also considerable physiological changes, so touching the scene produces emotions, and the youth are tempted at any time, further aggravating their nocturnal emission.

Since nocturnal emissions are frequent, the essence and blood produced physiologically are naturally not dedicated to metabolism, so dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, palpitations, aching back, weak memory, and inability to concentrate occur one after another. If one does not seek to remedy the situation urgently at this time, the condition will inevitably worsen, affecting the sexual nerves and causing local paralysis or hypersensitivity, or even complete impotence. Such a youth not only has no guarantee for his own health and studies, but also will not be able to fulfill his duties in future married life, resulting in all kinds of tragic incidents!

In short, the disadvantages of nocturnal emission are endless. Therefore, at the beginning of spring, those who suffer from this disease should quickly take remedial action. One way is to take "Hemetts' Semen-Strengthening Tablets" to consolidate the seminal vesicle and eliminate the hypersensitivity of the ejaculation center nerve. The other is to raise one's willpower, avoid bad contact, exercise diligently, rub the local area with cold water before going to bed, and pay attention to urination. If one can follow this, then no matter how many spring dreams there are, there will be no more emissions. If one has had various symptoms of weakness due to prolonged emission, then one can simultaneously use the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Substance" for tonification, which can generate semen and strengthen the kidneys, strengthen the brain and benefit the marrow within one day and night. If you continue to take it, you are guaranteed to regain your health in the shortest possible time.

Beauty and Health

### Passionate Woman (Must Have High Breast)

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Dr. Dimkarss, a great American expert in female physiology, said, "Passionate women must have high breasts." This initially caused many people to doubt. Later, he wrote an article "Breasts and Love" published in a famous magazine, explaining that the development of women's breasts is entirely based on the health of the ovaries, because the ovaries are the total hub for controlling female sexual function. When this sexual function is vigorous, it produces a large amount of internal secretions in the body. These internal secretions can promote the development of female characteristics, so in terms of body shape, the most obvious is that the breasts rise high. The nipples are sandalwood-colored, like the top of a cone-shaped mountain peak. Therefore, there are twin peaks in the chest, with a deep recess in the middle. How beautiful and intoxicating this is! In terms of emotions, it is also due to the stimulation of internal secretions that emotions are often rich and exhibit phenomena such as gentleness, warmth, happiness, sensitivity, and passion. Such a woman is the typical lover in the minds of men, a virtuous wife and loving mother in the family. …After this principle was explained, everyone began to believe that women's breasts not only have value in beauty and health but are also greatly related to inner emotions. Therefore, European and American women, in order to show their beauty, health, and passion, often pay attention to maintaining the development of their breasts. If there is anything unsatisfactory, they take the ovarian preparation "Female Germinal Substance" for tonification, so as to fully develop them. But when we look back at Chinese women, they not only do not pay attention to the development of their breasts but even use the method of breast binding to make them shriveled, which is really unreasonable and extremely foolish! As for those who have menstrual irregularities, leucorrhea, and other hidden diseases that damage the function of the ovaries, resulting in shriveled breasts, faded faces, and premature aging, these are even more common. Therefore, in the family, the feelings between husband and wife are inevitably weak, and they are like strangers, even though they are husband and wife! Even if they have children, this is just a flawed inheritance! Such a situation is not only extremely painful for them but also causes great harm to the country - the only remedy, according to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, is to take the ovarian preparation "Female Germinal Substance," which is the most effective and specific treatment. This agent can tonify the ovarian function and promote metabolism within one day and night after taking it. If you continue to take it, you can completely cure the above-mentioned hidden diseases in a short period of time. It can also make the breasts rise high, the cheeks rosy, and increase beauty, health, and passion.

Cases in Venereal Disease Treatment

Compiled by Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

(I) Early Marriage Hurts, Fortunately Cured

Patient Hua Longquan, from Nantong, Jiangsu, is now 25 years old and works as an accountant in a financial institution. (Chief complaint) - After early marriage, excessive sexual activity led to incomplete development, kidney deficiency and brain weakness, coughing up blood (Medical history) - Hua was inherently weak. Furthermore, due to his parents' doting, he married at the age of sixteen. The couple's love was very deep, leading to excessive sexual activity, greatly hindering his development. After three or four years, he felt extremely weak, his body was declining, and his memory was greatly reduced, but he still did not know to be afraid. He did not abstain from lust in time, gradually developing kidney deficiency. He also coughed up blood, eventually becoming hopeless. In the early winter of last year, he was introduced by his colleague Bao to seek treatment from me. (Treatment method) - I believe that Hua's illness was due to indulgence before his development was mature, causing great damage to the reproductive glands and incomplete development. Symptoms such as physical weakness, anemia, and premature aging occurred one after another. Taking a large amount of "Germinal Substance" was not enough to reverse the decline. So, I instructed Hua to buy and take it from the pharmacy. Hua took it for two consecutive months, and all kinds of symptoms were swept away. The decadent youth was transformed into a healthy husband, and now he is radiant and vigorous, and his wife is pregnant with a child.

(II) Cure of Sexual Nerve Hypersensitivity

Patient Han Guoqing, from Ningbo, Zhejiang, is now 23 years old. He came to Shanghai in 1937 to do business. (Chief complaint) - He has been masturbating for many years. Although he knows the harm, he cannot quit due to excessive lust. Recently, his sexual nerves have become increasingly sensitive, causing him great pain. Nocturnal emissions, spermatorrhea, sexual fatigue, dizziness, and erotic dreams plague him. (Current symptoms) - Local development is incomplete, reflexes are hyperactive, the posterior urethra is congested, and he also has severe neurasthenia. (Treatment method) - I instructed him to quit his bad habits, perform vaginal irrigation, and then cool the posterior urethra. I gave him electrotherapy once a day and used "Hemetts' Semen-Strengthening Tablets" to consolidate his seminal vesicle. The hypersensitivity gradually disappeared. At the same time, I used the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Substance" to eliminate his severe neurasthenia. The results were very good. After taking about three boxes each, he was completely cured.

However, later he claimed illness and took leave of absence, which was approved by this newspaper, instructing him to rest. Yesterday morning at around 9:00 a.m., he was wearing a gray silk cotton robe, a Melton cloth overcoat, a felt hat, and glasses. He left his residence and hired a rickshaw (license number 5795) pulled by a man from Jiangbei named Zhang Jinshu, intending to go to the Jingbao newspaper office at the intersection of Shandong Road and Hankou Road. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw reached the intersection of Rue du Dragon and Rue de la Course, a thin man about 30 years old, wearing a black long gown and a black felt hat, suddenly stopped his rickshaw and quickly pulled out a pistol, firing four shots at him. One bullet hit Qian's abdomen, and one hit his right hand. Seeing that things were not good, Qian jumped out of the rickshaw and ran forward. The shooter then fired several more shots, one bullet hitting the abdomen again and one hitting Qian's right temple. Wounded in vital areas, he fell to the ground. The murderer fled towards Rue de la Course, through the Western Temple (No. 63 Lane), and turned into Rue Yu Qiaqing to escape. By the time police officer No. 2383 from that area arrived, it was impossible to chase after him. He immediately reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched Western Detective Hui Gengsheng and Chinese Detective Shao JinFan to lead detectives to the scene of the incident to search and investigate. At the same time, an ambulance was summoned to rush Qian to the Renji Hospital for treatment. By this time, Qian could not speak. Soon his family also received the news and arrived. However, because the wounds were all in vital areas and he had lost too much blood, he could not be cured. He died at noon at around 12:00 p.m.. The body was sent from the hospital to the temporary autopsy office of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Jiaozhou Road at around 2:00 p.m., pending a report to the court prosecutor's office for inspection at 10:00 a.m. this morning. He is survived by his widow, Ms. Hu, who is 34 years old, and two sons and one daughter. The eldest daughter, Minyi, is currently 10 years old, and the eldest son, Dingxiong, is eight years old. Both are studying at Guangxia Primary School. The youngest son, Dingbang, is three years old and still in infancy. This unfortunate event is deeply grieved.

### The Portuguese Ship "San Threm" Was Searched by Japanese Warships; Lasted One and a Half Hours with Nothing Found; Took the Passenger and Cargo Manifests and Left the Ship

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Portuguese-flagged small ship "San Threm" (transliteration) was sailing along the coast. Last Friday (the 3rd) at 1:00 p.m., it sailed from Haimen to Shanghai. Among the passengers were foreigners such as Blanc of the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai and Watson, the chief detective of the Central Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Council. After sailing out of Haimen for some distance, it encountered

A Japanese destroyer. When the Portuguese ship's crew saw the warship sending the signal "Stop or we will fire," the Portuguese ship immediately stopped. The Japanese warship then sent the signal "Sail close to this ship and drop anchor." Soon, a Japanese officer led some sailors to board the ship. Captain Aika wore his uniform, but the radio operator did not. The Japanese military thought Mr. Aika was the radio operator, so they confined him in the cabin, with an armed sailor guarding the cabin door, and inspected the ship's passenger and cargo manifests.

They also searched the entire ship for one and a half hours. Whatever the Japanese military was searching for, they apparently found nothing, because the Chinese authorities in Haimen did not allow anyone under the age of 40 to leave the country. According to the Japanese officer's words to the passengers of the Portuguese ship, the ship was lucky to be detained for one hour and 45 minutes. Recently, the warship detained a German ship for 28 hours. Afterwards, the Japanese officer took the cargo and passenger manifests and led the river soldiers away from the ship. The Portuguese ship continued to sail to Shanghai, encountering no further obstruction, and returned to Shanghai at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday (the 4th).

### The Central Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity) Committee Assists Our Development of the Border Areas; Organizes Border Resources Survey Team; and Assists in Cultivating Technical Talents

The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Administration Commission has always spared no effort in supporting China's cultural undertakings. Recently, in view of China's active development of wartime economy, it has decided to allocate funds to organize a border economic resources survey team to assist the Chinese government in completing the border development plan and to do its best to assist in cultivating technical talents to meet the needs of construction work. The details are as follows:

Organizing a Survey Team to Investigate Resources. The committee has decided to organize the following three major teams to investigate border resources: The first team will investigate the economic resources of Sichuan and Xikang. The second team will investigate the provinces in the Northwest (including Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, etc.). The third team will investigate the provinces in the Southwest (including Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, etc.). It is now actively preparing for the establishment. The survey work of each team is tentatively scheduled for one year, with three months for preparation, six months for conducting on-site survey work, and another three months for completing the work.

Each Team is Divided into Five Working Groups. The committee has decided to establish five groups under the captain and vice-captain for the purpose of cooperation in public works. Each group will have one group leader and a number of members, all of whom will be experts. (1) The Geology Group will be responsible for the investigation of geology and geographical environment. (2) The Physics Group will be responsible for studying physical chemistry and engineering problems. (3) The Economics Group will be responsible for investigating the local economy, industry, commerce, and local political situation. (4) The Social Sciences Group will be responsible for investigating the local history, education, social situation, and archaeological research. (5) The Agriculture and Forestry Group will be responsible for investigating the local agriculture, forestry, biology, and animal husbandry. The annual working expenses of each team are set at 50,000 yuan. University students and staff are very enthusiastic about applying to join. It is said that the Sichuan-Xikang team will be able to start work in a short period of time.

Allocating Funds to Cultivate Technical Talents. In addition, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Administration Commission spares no effort in selecting and cultivating technical talents, either by assigning them to work or by providing them with continued training. Starting this year, it will allocate funds to subsidize 125 researchers in universities to engage in research institute laboratory work. Among them, 80 are planned to be selected from graduates of national and private universities. In the first year, a temporary monthly subsidy of 40 yuan will be provided. If the results are excellent within one year, a formal job will be assigned afterwards. Since the outbreak of the war, many universities in various places have been destroyed, and various research works have been interrupted. However, there are still more than 200 people continuing to study natural and social sciences with the support of Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds.

### The Chinese Benevolent Association for Child Welfare Distributes Winter Clothing: Over 4,300 Pieces Have Been Distributed; Nantong Natives Form a Fundraising Team

The Chinese Benevolent Association for Child Welfare has been distributing winter clothing to children in various Shanghai shelters since January 30th of this year. The winter clothing is transported by Red Cross vehicles, which has greatly facilitated the process. As of February 3rd, a total of 4,376 pieces have been distributed. The shelters that have received children's winter clothing include Jiangning, Weixing, the Fifth Yi Primary School, the Eleventh, Fifteenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Thirty-third, Thirty-fourth, and Forty-third shelters.

New Asia Sponsorship: A letter from Xu Guanqun, head of the fundraising team approved by the citizens' fundraising committee, states that New Asia Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has agreed to sponsor 50 refugees for one year, totaling 1,200 yuan in national currency, to be collected monthly by representatives of the association.

Nantong Natives: The Nantong Natives Association in Shanghai issues a notice to Nantong natives residing in Shanghai regarding fundraising for relief efforts, stating, "Those who have suffered the most from the devastating war are our fellow Nantong natives in Shanghai. Historically, the majority of Nantong residents in Shanghai have resided in Hongkou and Zhabei, and these areas have suffered the greatest losses in the recent conflict. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, various charitable organizations in the city are currently sheltering many refugees. Most of our afflicted fellow Nantong natives, except for a few who have returned home, are now living in these refugee shelters. Consider this: should our afflicted fellow natives only rely on assistance from people from other regions, while we stand idly by? 'Helping those in distress can dispel calamities and accumulate blessings.' Whether this saying is true or superstitious, from the perspective of human mutual aid, we should, without hesitation, open our purses to help refugees suffering from hunger and cold, especially since our afflicted fellow Nantong natives are among the Shanghai refugee population. Therefore, our association has now organized a fundraising team, hoping that our fellow Nantong natives in Shanghai will enthusiastically donate according to their means, whether as a one-time donation or a monthly contribution. If you are willing to generously contribute, please send your donations to No. 24, Furun Lane, Guizhou Road (behind the Jincheng Cinema), to be forwarded by our association to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, to fulfill the responsibilities of us Nantong natives residing in Shanghai."

Native Place Associations: After promoting the organization of fundraising teams by various native place associations, the donations submitted by these associations have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the Pudong Native Place Association's entertainment and other donations total more than 5,150 yuan, the Hubei Native Place Association has donated 2,000 yuan, the Shaoxing Seven Counties Native Place Association donates 1,000 yuan per month, the Changzhou Native Place Association donates 1,200 yuan, team leader Xu Guanqun has personally donated 1,000 yuan, and employees of the Jiangyin Native Place Association donate 6 yuan per month, for a total of over 10,000 yuan in donations.

Donations to Refugees: Mr. Zhu Weichu, a philanthropist, recently celebrated his and his wife's fortieth birthdays and donated 100 yuan in national currency, saved from reducing the cost of the banquet, through Ge Futian to the citizens' group to be used for refugee relief funds. In addition, the citizens' group received additional donations yesterday, including 15 yuan from the Juxing Friendship Association's dinner savings and 180 yuan from the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Red Cross for sponsoring 15 refugees for six months by Lü Huan and others.

### Reports of Reorganization at Chang Fang Sheng Are Inaccurate; No Changes to Customs Administration; Employment of Japanese Customs Officers Still Under Negotiation; Reorganization of the Entire Administrative System Is Impossible

Japanese sources have claimed that the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has been reorganized and that 70 Japanese customs officers have joined the service. All parties are paying serious attention to this rumor. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency to the Jianghai Customs, the above claim is completely inaccurate. There have been absolutely no changes to the reorganization of the Jianghai Customs administration. Everything is being handled in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the National Government. The Japanese side is deliberately spreading this rumor, apparently to confuse the public. As for the employment of a large number of Japanese customs officers, although the Japanese side has made this request, Deputy Commissioner Luo Fude has no authority to accept it, so negotiations are still ongoing and no decision has been made. Although Shanghai's special environment often leads to unwarranted interference in the exercise of its powers, it would be extremely difficult to reorganize the entire administrative system of the Jianghai Customs without the permission of the situation.

### Shanghai Postal Workers' Debt Repayment Movement: Over 2,000 Yuan Has Been Confirmed; Has Been Remitted to the National Government in Chongqing

In response to the "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement," all postal workers at the Shanghai Post Office previously agreed to contribute 2% of their salaries to the National Government to repay our national debt. This was unanimously approved by all postal workers, who signed up to donate. It has now been learned that the funds have been collected, totaling 2,538.60 yuan in national currency, and have been remitted to the National Government in Chongqing by the Central Bank. This action by the postal workers is commendable for its enthusiasm and can serve as a model for the labor community. It is hoped that all workers in the city will follow suit and achieve complete success.

### Zhejiang Prohibits the Export of Local Goods, Causing Prices to Rise; Shanghai and Ningbo Industrial Circles Telegraph Requests for Opening

Daily consumer goods in this city, such as local paper, charcoal, firewood, and domestically sold tea leaves, have traditionally relied on transportation from various ports in eastern Zhejiang for sale in Shanghai. Since the Zhejiang Customs was ordered to prohibit the export of 53 types of local products to Shanghai, the source of the above goods has been cut off, and market prices have also risen by 10-20%. In order to maintain the market, the Shanghai and Ningbo industrial and commercial circles have telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that they quickly order the release. At the same time, it is reported that the Wenzhou industries' sales offices have also sent a similar request to the Ministry of Finance, as the Ouhai Customs has also been ordered to prohibit the export of local products.

### Customs Patrol Vessels Set Sail to Supply Lighthouse Keepers: Sailing to the Waters of Yushan and Dajishan to Transport Food and Fuel

The patrol vessels "Liuxing" and "Haiguang" belonging to the Maritime Affairs Bureau of Jianghai Customs sailed to the waters of Yushan and Dajishan yesterday to transport food and coal to supply the lighthouse keepers. After completing their mission, they set sail back to Shanghai.

### Shanghai to Establish a National Goods Review Subcommittee: Specializing in Review and Certification Matters

The government has established a review committee to promote national goods, and this city will also establish a subcommittee. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese General Federation of Industry, and the Federation of Machine-Made National Goods Factories have jointly nominated more than 30 representatives and telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs for selection. It is reported that once the candidates have been selected, the subcommittee will be established to specifically handle the review of Shanghai's national goods and the issuance of certificates when they are exported to the mainland.

### Post Office Extends Time for Issuing and Receiving Postal Money Orders

The Shanghai Postal Administration, because it is the period for commercial account settlements, and the accounts of domestic and foreign industrial and commercial businesses are settled during this period, and because some counties and towns have fallen into war zones, and banks and money shops have either closed down or been destroyed by artillery fire, in order to facilitate the remittance of funds for the industrial and commercial sectors, has extended the time for issuing and receiving postal money orders from yesterday (usually until 4:00 PM, now extended to 6:00 PM, all offices implement this simultaneously).

### Zhejiang Local Bank Manages Zhejiang Province Matches: Implementing a Monopoly Can Increase Revenue by 2 Million Yuan Annually; Stipulating Prices to Strictly Prohibit Merchant Manipulation

The Zhejiang Provincial Government is implementing a match monopoly, and in order to facilitate sales, it has entered into a contract with the Zhejiang Local Bank, which will be the sole manager, stipulating the prices of various goods, with each package affixed with a 5-cent monopoly stamp, which can increase revenue by 2 million yuan annually. The details are as follows:

Local Bank Manages Public Sales: The Zhejiang Match Monopoly Office has not only sent personnel to be stationed in various match factories to handle special management matters, but also, in the locations of the Yongjia, Lishui, Yin County, Shaoxing, and other match companies, the monopoly is managed by the monopoly branch offices. In the remaining counties, a contract has been signed with the Zhejiang Local Bank, which will be the sole manager, establishing wholesale and retail outlets to sell at stipulated prices and suppress market prices.

### At the Dance Hall: Student Steals Overcoat: Three Conspire to Steal, One Arrested: Pawn Ticket for 46 Yuan Discovered

Ha Jiaxiang, a 19-year-old from Nanjing residing at No. 6, Pingjiang Lane, Lanweiai Road, French Concession, formerly a student at a certain middle school, went shopping at the Great New Company on the afternoon of the 4th of this month. At the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Qiaqing Road, he suddenly ran into his former classmate Wu Jiasheng. After greeting each other, Wu had a friend named Chen Aqi with him, whom Wu introduced to Ha as a student from a certain university. Since they were old classmates who had not seen each other for a long time, they went to Dadong Teahouse for refreshments. At that time, Wu had another friend named Weng Huaxiao (from Ningbo, 22 years old), who was already at the teahouse. Wu also introduced him. After eating, Wu and the others suggested going to the Cathay Dance Hall on Yu Qiaqing Road for tea and dancing, which was unanimously agreed upon. The four of them went to Cathay together, but Ha had other matters, so he placed his overcoat, worth 90 yuan, and a scarf, which he was wearing, on the sofa next to him instead of checking them in the cloakroom. Before long, Wu suddenly invited Ha out for a private conversation. Ha followed him out to the Great New Company across the street. Wu asked Ha for a loan, but Ha refused. Wu then falsely claimed that he needed to visit a friend at the Great New Dance Hall and told Ha to go back to Cathay first. Unexpectedly, when Ha entered the Cathay Dance Hall, his overcoat and scarf, as well as Chen and Weng, were gone.

Knowing He Had Been Conspired Against, He Urgently Reported to the New Gate Police: Not until 5 p.m. on the 5th did Ha Jiaxiang run into Weng Huaqing in front of the Great New Company. He grabbed him and handed him over to Detective Weng Peiyu, who took him to the police station. A pawn ticket for the overcoat was found on Weng. Weng admitted that he had pawned the overcoat at Xie Feng Pawnshop on Xiafei Road for 46 yuan. He and Wu and Chen had each received 15 yuan, and one yuan had already been spent. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special Court No. 1. Attorney Li Zhishan of the police station presented the case. After questioning by Judge Xiao, he was ordered to be detained pending further investigation in seven days.

### Bringing His Wife to Shanghai to Seek Refuge: Distant Cousin Gangs Up to Extort: Reported to the Police, Apprehended and Detained

Zhang Guowen, from Fengxian, Pudong, recently brought his wife, Ms. Wu, to Shanghai to seek refuge and is temporarily staying at Room 129, Qinghe Inn, Qinghe Lane, Zhejiang Road. On the 3rd of this month, Xu Shanchu, a distant cousin of Zhang, suddenly came to Zhang's room and claimed that he was a guerrilla fighter who was now stranded in Shanghai and could not return home. Therefore, he asked for financial assistance of 200 yuan, saying, "Otherwise, something unfavorable will happen to you." Intimidated by this threat, Zhang immediately borrowed 50 yuan in silver dollars from the Qinghe Inn front desk and gave it to Xu. The next day, Xu's younger brother came to demand money again. Zhang could not pay, and he forcibly seized two gold rings (worth over 30 yuan) that Zhang and his wife were wearing on their hands. As soon as Xu's younger brother left, Xu came again and, with several thugs, surrounded Zhang and demanded a large sum of money. Zhang could not bear the harassment and escaped under the pretext of going out to raise money, hiding at a friend Mr. Lin's house. He did not dare to go home that night. On the 5th, he instructed Mr. Lin to go to the Qinghe Inn to check on the situation. Xu Shanchu and seven or eight others were still occupying Zhang's room. Lin returned to report to Zhang, and they went to the Old Gate Police Station together. Detective Sun Dafa rushed there, but the room No. 129 of Qinghe was already empty. After investigation, it was learned that Xu and others had taken Zhang's wife to Room 11, Lane 118, Zhejiang Road. He immediately went there and arrested Xu and his accomplices, Lu Maofu, Gu Ziming, Wang Bingming, You Genfu, Jin Agen, Yang Zhengxing, Ma Fugen, and a total of eight people. Yesterday, they were sent to Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court No. 1. Attorney Ru Baoyi of the police station said that the case was complicated and the police were conducting a detailed investigation. Therefore, he requested permission to temporarily detain the defendants in order to investigate the matter, etc. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefen, he ordered them to be detained and remanded for further questioning.

### Gang of Thieves Disagree on Division: Stabbed an Accomplice

Several thieves were apprehended, and many weapons were seized.

On the night of the 31st of last month, at about 10 p.m., an incident occurred in Room 20 of the Haitongchun Inn on Yunnan Road, where a guest, Chang Dewu (aka Tang Dejiu), was stabbed with a knife. When the Old Gate Police Station heard the alarm, they ordered detectives to investigate. The assailant had already fled, leaving only the injured man to be transported to the Hager Road Refugee Hospital. Chang was very secretive about the reason for being stabbed.

It was not until the 2nd of this month that detectives Shao Jingfan, Sun Wenxi, Wu Junqing, Zhou Yushan, etc., of the Chengdu Road Police Station apprehended two thieves from Shandong, Yan Chengrun and Chen Shaoying, at the intersection of Racecourse Road and Longmen Road and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. During this period, it was revealed that Chang Dewu, who was injured, was actually a member of a gang of thieves and that the reason he was stabbed was due to a dispute over the division of the spoils. Detectives not only transferred Chang to the hospital of the Public Works Department but also, based on the clues obtained from the arrested criminals, assisted Western detective Tai Maibei the day before yesterday to go to Room 1 of the First Inn on Zhejiang Road and arrested gang members Lin Chuncai, from Jiangbei, Liu Fuyun (aka Xiao Xiaojian), Ma Yongliang, from Shandong, Guo Guanwu, Jin Zhushi (a woman), Wang San, from Xuzhou, Zhang Xichang, from Siyang, Yang Hejin, from Nanjing, Wang Bian's wife (a Jiangbei woman), and nine others. Then they went to

Police Lawyer Li Zhishan Stated The Case And Requested A Postponement Until The 10th For Joint Interrogation With Yan Chengjian And Others. Judge Xiao Interrogated Each Criminal Briefly And Ordered Them To Be Detained And The Cases To Be Combined For Investigation.

### Tragic Truck Accident: Driver Was Negligent and Failed to Brake in Time: The Fang Sisters Died Together

On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, at about 5 p.m., a tragic accident occurred at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Seymour Road, where a military truck crashed, resulting in fatalities. It was the most unfortunate of all traffic accidents. The brief details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now, according to the results of the investigation, the details are recorded as follows:

Fang's Brief Biography: The deceased Fang sisters were pioneers in the women's circles of Jiaxing. Fang Ying, whose given name was Jingzhao, was over 60 years old and had been the principal of Jiaxing Fanlihu County Girls' Middle School for more than 20 years, achieving considerable accomplishments. After the outbreak of the war, school affairs were suspended. Fang transited from eastern Zhejiang to Shanghai, where she pawned a house on Gondon Road, Aiwuyi Road. Those living with her were her aunt and her brother's wife (her husband, Mr. Gu, had died early). Fang Yinchuan was her younger sister, over 50 years old, and was the wife of Jiang Zhixin, the director of Jiaxing Dexin Hospital. She was skilled in obstetrics and surgery and assisted her husband in managing the hospital affairs, also known for her abilities. The hospital now has a branch clinic inside the Ying Primary School at the east end of Yapei Road, Fuxu Road, and a separate residence in Kangle Village.

Going Out to Visit Friends: On the afternoon of the 4th, the Fang sisters went to Yuyuan Road to visit friends. At about 5 o'clock, they took a bus on Route 9 to return. At that time, the traffic was heavy and continuous, and it was very difficult to cross the road. The Fang sisters walked side by side, and for the sake of caution, they detoured to the corner of Seymour Road in order to cross over. The advertising sign for the Dexin Hospital branch clinic was already in sight.

The Driver Was Careless: At this moment, a cargo truck (permit number 1617) sped from the west and suddenly made a sharp turn to the left. Pedestrians in the middle of Seymour Road were caught off guard, and the Fang sisters were the first to be hit, knocked down by the giant wheels, injuring their ribs and dying on the spot. According to eyewitnesses at the time, two other people were thrown several feet away, but they did not suffer fatal injuries. The disaster can be described as tragic.

After the Accident: The driver of the truck that caused the accident was immediately taken to the police station for questioning. The deceased were taken to Guangren Hospital, but there was no way to revive them. The accident scene was only a few dozen steps away from the Dexin Hospital branch clinic. A staff member informed the director of the news of the death of two pedestrians. The director initially did not investigate further until dinner time, when he wondered why his wife had not returned. He thought that she was having dinner at her friend's house, so he was relieved and returned to his private residence in Kangle Village to rest. It was not until after 8 o'clock that he received the terrible news. The whole family was shocked. After the incident, the police made great efforts to investigate the family of the deceased, searching the friend's contact address in the notebook found on the deceased, and finally reached their destination. However, three hours had already passed.

Funeral Arrangements: After the families of the deceased heard the news, the bodies had been transferred to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. It was a Sunday, so there was no office. It was not until 9 a.m. yesterday that the examination was completed. Funeral arrangements were made at the Central and Dazhong Funeral Homes. There are not a few natives of Jiaxing in Shanghai, and they are initiating a meeting to mourn and pay respects in the coming days.

### Extremely Cold Weather

Today's Weather May Turn Slightly Warmer

The weather in this city this winter has been very mild, like spring, unlike the severe winter. It wasn't until the 5th (the Beginning of Spring Festival) that it suddenly turned cold. Yesterday's weather was even colder, with the lowest temperature dropping to 24.8 degrees (below freezing), the first severe cold this year. Residents reported that they were shivering. It is said that the astronomical observatory has learned that the dramatic changes in the weather in recent days are due to the changes caused by the meeting of low and high pressure. Therefore, wind and snowflakes are caused by this kind of action. However, now the low pressure has been driven back by the high pressure, so the weather is returning to normal, and it may be slightly warmer today.

### Collecting Scrap Metal to Sell to the Japanese and Sending Threatening Letters to Extort Money

Three Defendants Confess to Using the Proceeds for Military Expenses; Debate Concludes, Sentencing on the 13th

Huang Peng, resident at No. 9, Henry Apartments, Henry Road, French Concession,
formerly operated an iron factory in the Nanshi area.
After the outbreak of the war, he collected scrap metal and sold it
to the Japanese for profit. In early October of last year,
Zhu Zhongsheng, a native of Chuansha, claiming to be the commander of a guerrilla
force, residing at No. 312, Route Lartigue, learned of this.
He sent a letter to Huang Peng threatening extortion. As a result of negotiations between the two parties at the
Weida Hotel on Rue Foch, Huang Peng paid
6,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in government bonds,
to settle the matter. Subsequently, Zhu sent another letter to Huang Jisheng at No. 358, Route du Consulat, demanding money,
enclosing three bullets in the letter. He was soon discovered by the French
police. Zhu set up a blackmail and extortion
operation at the Dalai Hotel at
No. 15, Gansdong Road.
Therefore, detectives arrested Zhu Zhongsheng and his accomplices,
Bao Chongzhen, Zhou Junmei, Zhang Yaozhong, Zhang Guojun,
Zhang Amao, and Zhang Fengxiang, seven people in total, one after another on the afternoon of December 30 last year,
and seized a pistol,
two hand grenades, and a large leather suitcase containing threatening letters, drafts, envelopes, symbols, and other items from the Dalai Hotel. They were escorted to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention.
Repeated requests were made to extend the investigation.
The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. This case is now being handled by the Police Department.
The investigation has concluded. Yesterday morning,
Judge Zhang Minsheng of the Second Special Court
presided over the trial in the First Criminal Court. Yuan Jiahong, a lawyer from the French Concession administration, explained the case
and the investigation process, prosecuting Zhu Zhongsheng, Zhou Junmei, Zhang Yaozhong, and Zhang Guojun
for the crime under Article 346 of the Criminal Code. He also stated that there was
no connection with Bao Chongzhen, Zhang Amao, and Zhang Fengxiang, and they would not be prosecuted.
Huang Peng then recounted the extortion he suffered. When questioned, Zhu Zhongsheng confessed that, upon receiving a report that
Huang Peng was providing
scrap metal to the enemy to make a profit,
he sent three letters.

In the current environment, sending letters was nothing more than a warning to him. Huang voluntarily negotiated with him and gave him
the money, agreeing on 6,000 yuan. On October 5th, he first received cash and 1,000 yuan in government bonds at the Weida Hotel.
On the 7th of the same month, he received 540 yuan at Room 315 of the Great China Hotel.
Of this amount, 1,700 yuan was allocated to Pei Dong for military expenses, and the remaining funds were used by various branch offices in Shanghai. Apart from receiving money from Huang Peng's office at No. 531, Zhonghui Building, he also contacted
Huang Jisheng at No. 385, Fulili Road, Yuyuanxiang Foreign Goods Store on Gansdong Road, and Fuchang Wood Firm at No. 35, Jules Plass Road, but did not receive any money. Zhou Junmei admitted to writing the letters, and Zhang Yaozhong admitted
to sending the letters
on the orders of the commander. Zhang Guojun confessed to obtaining over 190 yuan, 100 yuan of which was used for travel expenses to Taicang, and over 90 yuan was distributed among the families of comrades.
At this point in the interrogation, the court, considering the case to be clear, ordered the opening of the debate. After mutual arguments between the lawyer of the French Concession administration and the defense lawyers of the defendants, the court announced the conclusion of the trial and set the sentencing for the 13th. The defendants were remanded into custody.

Robbery Case on Rue du Marché
Police Continue Investigation

At 6:50 AM on the 4th of this month,
a struggle between Chinese and Western police and robbers occurred on Rue du Marché, near the intersection of Rue Montauban, French Concession.
As a result, the robber Wang Fuyun, also known as Zhang Agen, was killed.
A fellow robber, Fan Xiaomao, was arrested by detectives at the entrance of Lane 23, Route des Pères, and taken back to the police station for investigation. The robber's body was sent to the morgue of the Tou-Se-We Orphanage for examination. The details have been reported in detail.
Yesterday, the French police reported the case to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic doctor went to the scene to examine the body and then sat in court.
First, detectives reported the situation of the investigation after the incident.
Then, the victim, Hou Arong (a tea boy at Wing On Company), testified that the deceased, his escaped accomplices, and the arrested Fan Xiaomao, impersonated detectives
and came to search for morphine as a pretext for robbery.
The robber Fan Xiaomao was sent to court by the police.
According to his confession, Zhang Ada, who is still at large, instigated him, along with the deceased Zhang Agen, and Wang Er and
Wang San, who are also at large, to commit the robbery.
Previously, they had robbed a coat and a gold ring in Xinxinli, Dapu Bridge.
No family members of the deceased have come forward. The official autopsy confirmed that Wang Fuyun,
also known as Zhang Agen, died from gunshot wounds. The body was handed over to the mortuary for burial. The remaining criminals were handed over to the police department for investigation and prosecution.
At 3 PM, the police sent Fan Xiaomao to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court.
Yuan Jiahong, a lawyer from the French Concession administration, stated that the Police Department's investigation of the defendant's robbery case was not yet concluded and requested a postponement of the interrogation. After Judge Zhang Minsheng verified and questioned the defendant, he ruled that the case would be re-examined on the 15th, and the defendant was remanded into custody.

Demanding Protection Money Leads to Murder Case
The Murderer Sentenced to Five Years

The Civil Portion of the Case Transferred to the Civil Court

The rogue Xu Bingsheng, (nicknamed "Blind Afu,"
previously convicted of selling morphine and sentenced to one year and four months by the First Special Court after being arrested by the Municipal Police),
engaged in drug trafficking in the middle room of No. 66, Ruifuli, Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, after being released upon completion of his sentence.
At 8 PM on December 27 last year, the hooligan Chen Along
and four or five of his accomplices came to Xu to demand protection money.
When Xu refused, they argued and quarreled. Xu blew out the candle
and stabbed Chen in a vital spot in the dark, killing him on the spot.
Xu and Chen's accomplices fled in a panic. Later, the police arrested Xu
and sent him to the Second Special Court for prosecution on the charge of murder.
The deceased's mother, Li Zhang, also filed an incidental civil lawsuit. After Judge Zhang Minsheng held several hearings and
appointed lawyer Wang Shizong to defend Xu, he declared the
trial concluded and set a date for sentencing. The details have been reported in the newspapers.
Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang presided over the sentencing in the First Criminal Court.
Xu Bingsheng was sentenced to five years in prison for murder.
The incidental civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court. During the appeal period,
the defendant was held in custody.

Shameless Men and Women
Peddling Obscene Photos

Large-Scale Manufacturing Operation Uncovered; Machines, Pornographic Films, Negatives, etc., Seized

Wang Jinfeng (20 years old, from Suzhou, resident at No. 242, Caishi Street), Xu Yunfeng (40 years old,
resident at No. 3, Lane 19, Route des Soeurs), Ma Shuangsheng (56 years old), and others,
were found in possession of a
large number of obscene
photos near Shansi Road on Fuzhou Road at around 8 PM on January
31. They were arrested by Chinese detective Qian Xianning of the Central Police Department
and sent to the First Special Court for prosecution on charges of undermining public morals. They had been interrogated once, and the case was scheduled for a later date.
During the postponement, based on the defendants' confessions, the police,
together with personnel from the French Police Department, uncovered a
huge filming and manufacturing operation at No. 89, Lane 276, Caishi Road on the morning of the 4th of this month.
Two manufacturing machines, over one hundred types of romantic and shameless pornographic photos of men and women of a certain nationality, and dozens of boxes of inferior negatives were seized.
A female suspect, Xu Li (43 years old, from Suzhou), and her son,
Xu Guoliang, were arrested. The main suspect, Xu Damao (Xu Li's husband), is at large.
They were sent to the First Special Court yesterday morning
for prosecution according to the law. A request was made to postpone the case and merge it with the case of Gongjinshu and others for trial.
After hearing the case, the court briefly questioned the defendants and then ruled that the case would be postponed until the morning of the 8th for further examination.

### Japanese Soldiers Tired of War

Anti-War Slogans Posted Everywhere Inside the Jiangnan Shipyard

The Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochangmiao, Nanshi,
which was occupied by the Japanese Qing Company, is now converted to a Japanese naval
shipyard. It has recruited seven or eight hundred workers, and all
the foremen, over a hundred people, are Japanese.
All of these hundred or so people were conscripted into military service in their home country.
Because they were unwilling to fight on the front lines, they maneuvered to obtain this military factory job.
However, sometimes because they have been stationed idly for six months, or because of misconduct, they still have to be transferred out,
which causes them great distress. Unexpectedly, recently,
anti-war and anti-warlord slogans and leaflets have been posted throughout the factory,
more than in any other factory. After their superiors came to the factory for inspection and discovered this situation,
they launched a major "ideological review." Therefore,
most of the Japanese soldiers and workers in the factory were transferred to the front lines.

### Thirteen Truckloads of Japanese Soldiers' Ashes Shipped Back Home

The Heavy Losses of the Japanese Army Can Be Seen From This

According to a source from Hongkou yesterday, thirteen truckloads of Japanese
soldiers' ashes were witnessed being loaded onto ships and transported back to Japan.
The ashes of the Japanese soldiers were placed in iron cans,
with their names, ages, and dates of death written on the outside.
It is unknown where they came from. Each
truck had a large wreath hung in front of it.
This shows the large number of Japanese soldiers who have died.

### The Puppet "City Government" Suffers Financial Panic and is on the Brink of Collapse

Since this month, the puppet "City Government"
has been forced by the puppet "Renovation Government" to abolish various puppet "consumption
taxes," which has caused a major financial panic for February.
During the puppet "Office" era, the monthly expenses for both the upper and lower levels were 280,000.
After the reorganization into the puppet "City Government,"
Chuan Xiaoyan eagerly sought to expand his power, increasing the expenses to 480,000. This year, it has increased to 600,000.
The reason for the rapid increase is due to the increasingly rampant corruption
within the puppet "Government."
Although the puppet "Renovation Government" reluctantly abolished the puppet "taxes" in various places,
it promised to subsidize the puppet "Government" with 400,000 yuan per month. However, this verbal assurance
will become a mere illusion, as the "Renovation Government" itself
is already struggling to take care of its own affairs. Hearing this disappointing news,
it is still planning to levy a puppet "land tax" and a puppet "business
tax" to make up for the shortfall. However, after threatening for three months to enforce
the "land reporting," no one paid attention. The puppet "business
tax" is also uncertain, as most of the businesses in the suburbs have not resumed operations.
Therefore, there is no prospect of being able to fund the puppet government in February (
most of which is puppet staff salaries).
In the past, there were disputes over the order in which the puppet "Government"
paid salaries. The puppet Finance Bureau was the first to pay, on the 24th of each month.
The puppet "City Government" paid on the 25th,
the puppet Public Utilities Bureau on the 26th, and other puppet "Police Bureaus"
on the 28th. However, the affiliated puppet "organizations," such as the
"Police Brigade," would not be paid until the second or third day of the following month.
This was unfair, and the puppet staff generally complained.
This almost caused internal conflict. Now that there is no prospect of paying any salaries for this month,
both the big and small puppets are extremely anxious.

### Chinese Army Executes Spy

Gu Zhenghua, a local man aged 29,
worked as a clerk in the Xinhua Transportation Company organized under the protection of the Japanese. He specialized in patrolling
goods in the area of West Hongqiao Road, Great West Road, and Zhongshan Road.
Taking advantage of his position, Gu shamelessly
acted as a spy for the Japanese army. His agency was located in
Room 1 of a certain hotel on Avenue Edward VII.
The day before yesterday afternoon, Gu was instructed by the Japanese to go to the countryside to inquire about the whereabouts of the guerrillas.
When he reached the Hongqiao Road and
Bintingtou areas in West Shanghai, he encountered a guerrilla patrol
passing by. They noticed that Gu's behavior was suspicious and went forward to question him.
Gu was evasive. After repeated interrogation,
he revealed the truth and a secret address
and a transportation pass issued by the Japanese
company were found on his person. The soldiers of the team were furious after hearing his confession.
They executed the criminal Gu Zhenghua on the spot.

### Shenxin No. 6 Factory Suffers an Accident

The storeroom of the Shenxin No. 6 Factory at No. 22, West Lake Road, Yangshupu, East Shanghai,
suddenly caught fire at 6:30 PM yesterday. Thick smoke spread immediately,
and the fire was very fierce. Subsequently, the fire brigade arrived on the scene
and tried their best to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished after an hour.
As a result, a corner of the storeroom and dozens of bales of cotton
were burned, but the loss was slight.

### Young Man Commits Suicide by Poison

Pan Jiaxing, 25 years old, lived at No. 8, Kangjia Village, Connaught Road, West Shanghai.
Yesterday afternoon, Pan, due to economic pressure,
suddenly became despondent and swallowed poisonous liquid
behind people's backs to commit suicide. Later, he was discovered
and immediately taken by car to the Red Cross Hospital on Route Haig for treatment.
He had taken a large amount of poison, and his life was in extreme danger.

### Effective Medicine for Frostbite

Swelling Disappears on the Day It Hasn't Broken

Recovery in Days for Ones That Have Already Festered

Frostbite is caused by the stagnation of blood. It starts with redness and
intense pain. After it ulcerates, the pus drips, and the pain is even more severe.

Once used, the pain and itching stop immediately, and the redness and swelling disappear.
(2) Pearl White Jade Cream is specially for treating festered frostbite. Once used, it removes decay and promotes new growth,
leading to recovery in a matter of days. The price is 0.25 yuan per bottle for Ruyi Water and 0.4 yuan per box for White Jade Cream. Telephone: 92525. No delivery is provided.

### Finance - Buying Activity Intensifies - US Dollar Breaks Through 16 Yuan Mark - Tientsin and Peking Exchange Banks Actively Accumulating - Japanese Merchants Also Secretly Active

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw banks acting on behalf of foreign exchange banks in Tientsin and Peking continuing their relentless accumulation, with Japanese banks also secretly active in acquiring currency. Additionally, Sassoon and other major foreign firms were also aggressively buying, so even with Hong Kong Electric and HSBC supplying to maintain the market, the overall position was still short. The underlying trend became increasingly tight. Sterling was at its tightest, quoted at 8 1/8 pence at 15.625. The US dollar also broke through the 16 yuan mark, with the softest quote at 15.90625 yuan. The Hong Kong dollar weakened further due to strong buying interest from banks. Trading volume was extremely high throughout the day.

In the early morning, London's large denominations continued to rise, New York silver prices remained flat, London spot gold contracted by half a penny, and exchange rates between Sterling and the US dollar, the French franc, and the Shanghai dollar remained unchanged. The US dollar rose by 0.0625 against the Sterling and 0.025 against the French franc, remaining flat against the Shanghai dollar. The official rates of the Central Bank remained unchanged. Banks opened early with spot selling prices: Sterling at 8 1/8 pence and 25, the US dollar at 16.09375 yuan, Sterling being flat and the US dollar being up 0.03125 yuan compared to last Saturday afternoon closing. After the opening, favorable US banks like McCallie and others raced to aggressively acquire currency, and the premium between Hong Kong Electric, Sterling and gold narrowed from 8 1/8 pence at 21875 to 203125, and the US dollar tightened from 16.0625 to 16.0 yuan. So the situation was quite weak. HSBC's announced rates were unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced at 0.025, calculated as 5.25%. Afterwards, Western and US banks also came in to compete for settlement, and the banks' willingness to supply was weak, further tightening the underlying trend. Sassoon aggressively bought, with favorable banks Huabi and Sterling at 8 1/8 pence at 203125, then settled with American banks, Indosuez, Huabi, and Holland for the US dollar at 16.0 yuan. Near noon, the US dollar broke through the 16 yuan mark, tightening to 15.96875 yuan. The Hong Kong dollar also tightened because of strong buying appetite from foreign exchange banks. Huayi and Holland bought Hong Kong dollars from money changers at 54.875 yuan.

In the afternoon, favorable banks and foreign firms competed to aggressively acquire currency. HSBC's Sterling was only 8 1/8 pence at 1875, and the US dollar was 15.9375 yuan. Sterling was at its tightest, quoted at 8 1/8 pence at 15.625. The US dollar was also quoted at 15.9025 at its tightest. Afterwards, Indosuez bought Hong Kong dollars from money changers at 54.875 and 75, making the market price more expensive. Extended to late closing, banks' selling prices were: Sterling at 8 1/8 pence at 171875, US dollar at 15.90625 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday afternoon closing, Sterling contracted by 0.078125, and the US dollar tightened by 156.

### Tientsin and Hong Kong Syndicates Compete to Purchase - Cash Prices Rise Again - Highest Reaching 2057 Yuan

Yesterday's spot gold black market prices rose again. Easing European tensions led to tight conditions in the foreign exchange black market. With renewed confidence in the market, Tientsin and Hong Kong syndicates secretly instructed certain money changers to actively buy, and local wealthy individuals and securities firms followed suit, pushing prices higher. Although cash dealers, silver shops, and money changers sold, the imbalance between supply and demand remained significant. Prices once reached a peak of 2057 yuan, an increase of 9 yuan. There were several fluctuations along the way, but no major disturbances. Trading activity was high. Silver jewelry prices also increased by one yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold prices decreased.

Spot Gold Up 9 Yuan

The opening selling price for each bar (10 taels) was 2040 yuan, but no transactions were seen. At 9:50 AM, a money changer first bought 50 taels from a cash dealer at 2039 yuan. Subsequently, a securities firm bought 50 taels from a cash dealer at 40 yuan. Later, the money changer bought another 50 taels from a cash dealer at the same price (reportedly on behalf of wealthy individuals in the city). After hearing that foreign exchange was being secretly purchased by Tientsin foreign exchange banks, the underlying trend immediately tightened, leading another money changer to aggressively buy on behalf of Tientsin and Hong Kong syndicates. The price also rose accordingly. Another money changer bought 50 taels from a cash dealer at 42 yuan. With sellers mostly standing aside, the money changer further bought 50 taels from a gold dealer at a jump of 46 yuan. Fortunately, a silver shop suddenly sold on behalf of many profit-taking clients, curbing the upward trend. Another money changer bought 100 taels from a silver shop at 45 yuan and 46 yuan. Later, a money changer also sold on behalf of clients, gradually pushing the price down, selling 50 taels to a gold dealer at 46 yuan, then selling 50 taels to another money changer at 44.5 yuan. Another silver shop sold 50 taels to another money changer at 44 yuan. After a period of stabilization, another money changer bought 50 taels from a cash dealer at 42 yuan at 11:00 AM. Finally, another money changer bought 50 taels from a cash dealer at 45 yuan as the noon closing price. At 1:45 PM, the money changer bought 50 taels from a colleague at 47 yuan. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market, affected by aggressive purchases by foreign firms, saw its underlying trend soften, boosting confidence in the market. Tientsin and Hong Kong syndicates continued to absorb currency aggressively, while sellers mostly stood aside. The market price then broke through the 50 yuan mark. Silver shops made 50 tael transactions with each other at 53 yuan. A gold dealer bought 50 taels from a money changer at 55 yuan. The money changer then bought 50 taels from a colleague at 57 yuan as the highest price. Afterwards, due to some clients taking profits, the price fell back. Silver shops sold 50 taels to money changers at 55 yuan, and money changers made 50 tael transactions with each other at 53 yuan. Finally, money changers made 50 tael transactions with each other at 2054 yuan as the late closing price, up 9 yuan from last Saturday. The selling price of cash gold dealer's current brand gold was 206 yuan, and the buying price was 2045 yuan. The current benchmark gold price was 50 yuan lower than the posted gold price.

Jewelry Up 1 Yuan

The price of silver jewelry per tael initially remained unchanged. At 2:30 PM, spot gold was approaching the 60 yuan mark, leading to a 1 yuan increase in jewelry prices. Da Tong Hang and Lao Qingyun raised the price to 208 yuan, while Xin Tong Hang quoted 206 yuan and bought back at 200 yuan.

Customs Gold Down Slightly

The Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash was 1212.8 yuan for both spot and future. The posted Customs gold price was also down slightly by 0.001 yuan, calculated at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 0.4 yuan to 1208.2 yuan, due to the sudden contraction of British pure gold by half a penny per ounce in the London telegraph report on the 4th.

### Wealthy Individuals Buy Foreign Currencies Again - British and American Gold Pounds Surge

Last Saturday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, British and American exchange rates remained unchanged, and the foreign currency black market contracted sharply. The trend seemed difficult to contain for a while, due to the North China authorities' relentless efforts to destroy the legal tender. They have now decided to ban its circulation starting from March 10. Under pressure, the people of North China have little resistance. Wealthy individuals are not only transferring legal tender to Shanghai and Hong Kong, but also exchanging it for foreign currency or cash, leading to a sharp increase in demand for foreign exchange and cash. Banks and brokerage firms are constantly purchasing, but local banks' willingness to sell is weak, and supply is difficult. Moreover, foreign firms' settlements are very strong. Although Hong Kong Electric's supply is still strong, it is difficult to meet the huge demand, resulting in a very tense situation. Spot gold is weak due to exchange rates, and Tientsin syndicates' buying appetite is strong. Market prices are rising gradually, although profit-taking is not lacking. Gold dealers, money changers, and speculators are actively accumulating, fueling the trend to profit, which is truly heart-wrenching. Foreign currencies, boosted by weak foreign exchange and high spot gold prices, are rising rapidly, and the acquisition by wealthy individuals is making them even more expensive. Profit-taking sales are strong, and the pursuit of high prices is even stronger, making the situation very sharp. Trading volume was very high throughout the day. Public Association trading was also strong. Dingyuan sold to Yongtai for British gold pounds 50, also sold to Qintai for British gold pounds 50. Baotai sold to Tongfeng for British gold pounds 30, also sold to Sen Tai for Singapore dollars 50. Yongsheng sold to Qintai for American gold pounds 20, Baoxiang sold to Hongchang for British gold pounds 60, Hongchang sold to Jinda for American gold pounds 10. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pound up 0.3 yuan, British gold note up 0.22 yuan, American gold pound up 0.6 yuan, American gold note up 0.055 yuan, Hong Kong note up 0.018 yuan, French franc note up 0.001 yuan, Singapore note up 0.03 yuan, Dutch note up 0.02 yuan, Robi note up 0.025 yuan, Canadian note up 0.07 yuan, Philippine note up 0.03 yuan, Australian gold note up 0.2 yuan. Only Annam note, Italian note, German gold note, and Hallore note remained unchanged.

### Discount Rate Declines

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange and draft bills gradually declined. It initially hovered between 35 and 36 yuan per thousand, then 35.5 yuan at noon, and 35.25 yuan in the afternoon, down 0.075 yuan compared to last Saturday.

### Securities - Rumors of New Loan Agreement - Bond Market Fluctuates

Yesterday's security black market situation fluctuated greatly. In the morning, it was sluggish, but in the afternoon, the rumor of a new American loan agreement injected a strong stimulant, suddenly turning it into an upsurge. While there is the possibility of a new American loan, the reality is still far away. However, it cannot be denied that the market's buying sentiment has increased. The noticeable factors throughout the day were No. 10's initial intention to sell, which continued to sell without stopping, and the surge in physical goods represented by No. 5 on behalf of a certain bank, which hindered the rise. The major sellers did not stop, and the rise was limited in the end.

Yesterday, the long-term bonds fluctuated rapidly. Initially, No. 15 compensated for short positions on behalf of the major sellers, and then Tiansheng and Lemao exclusively bought Class A bonds, which strengthened the trend. However, the high prices then caused No. 10 to sell again, weakening the trend. No. 5's representation of financial circles resulted in a flow of physical goods, turning the rising trend into a falling trend. At the same time, although Tongkang absorbed aggressively, many retail investors also took profit, ultimately making it difficult to push the price up. Many bonds fell back by as much as one yuan. In the afternoon, rumors of a new Sino-American loan agreement spread throughout the market, causing a sudden rise. No. 20 compensated for short positions on behalf of the major sellers, Tiansheng increased long positions, and No. 10 and others stopped selling. Market sentiment was strong, and the buyers suddenly gained the upper hand. All bonds returned to high of 0.5 or 0.6 yuan. The Class D bonds, which had not been traded for many days, only had a small number of transactions, so they rose uniquely by 1.5 yuan compared to before. Trading in 96 was also quite lively, stopping the falling trend. As a result, Class A bonds only fell slightly by 0.15 yuan, while most others rose by 0.3 or 0.5 yuan, except for Class D bonds, which rose by 1.5 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 900,000 yuan. The following is a brief table:

Stock trading was sluggish again. There were very few transactions in the China General Edison Company stock, and the price was still firm. The rest were all under discussion.

The American-owned China Land Company developed six-percent corporate bonds worth 500,000 yuan in 1934, with a fixed term of 10 to 30 years for repayment. Interest was paid at the end of June and December each year. The Yangtze Insurance Association underwrote the management of the bonds at No. 26, The Bund, this city.  It has been learned that these bonds will be redeemed at 90 percent of their face value starting from the 14th of this month (February), along with the payment of interest due on the principal, calculated from January 1 to the date of redemption, totaling 45 days.  These bonds were previously traded at 70 percent of their face value on December 8th of last year. Recently, someone offered to buy them at 99.25 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton - Sales Improve - Cotton Yarn Rise Resumes - Various Yarns Rise by 5, 6, or 7 Yuan - Manufacturers Open in Large Quantities Again

The yarn market's rising trend is intensifying, with robust sales in areas such as Chaozhou, Shantou, Fujian, and Yunnan.  Generally, colleagues are also tracking the trend due to the improving environment, resulting in a tight supply.  Fortunately, factories are resuming sales during the rise to meet demand, and market sentiment is still able to stabilize.  However, with active actual demand, domestic customers are further boosted.  The prices of 20-count Double Horse and Angel brand yarns are rising sharply, with selling prices returning to 4034 yuan, only 2 yuan short of the highest peak of 406 yuan on January 25.  Whether the price will break through the previous high depends on customer sales.

In the current yarn market, market sentiment opened normally in the morning, with a rise of 2 yuan for 20-count Biema to 400 yuan, but the amount sold was very small, with 30 bales traded between colleagues.  Soon, actual demand from Fujian improved, with a very strong buying appetite and a large amount of orders.  At the same time, buyers from Hong Kong, Shantou, Yunnan, inland regions, and Jiangxi were actively purchasing.  Market prices advanced step by step, improving with each transaction.  Finally, the price of Tian Nu reached 404 yuan, and Double Horse reached 403 yuan.  The market remained tight after closing.  The total volume traded in the morning was 2,042 bales, with fewer transactions between colleagues and more actual business.  460 bales were traded the previous day, for a total of 2,502 bales.  In terms of prices, 20-count Double Horse was up 5 yuan from the previous day, Tian Nu was up 7 yuan, Double Globe was up 4.5 yuan, Tejincheng was flat, Eight Immortals was up 5 yuan, and San Ding was up 2 yuan.  10-count coarse yarns rose significantly.  Factories increased their sales again, with Shenxin Factory selling 950 bales of 10-count Boy Scout at a price of 296 yuan, Rongfeng Factory selling 50 bales of Golden Bridge at a price of 397.5 yuan, Xinyu Factory selling 50 bales of 10-count Biandiqiu at a price of 299 yuan, and Yongan Factory selling 200 bales of 20-count Tejincheng at a price of 400 yuan. The bills of lading were all current.  Yesterday, 80 pieces of yarn came from Tianjin, and today 55 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin.  The trading volume of each region is recorded below:

Colleagues 635 Shantou 665

Fuzhou 170 Hong Kong 50

Ningbo 2 Yunnan 140

Xiamen 20 Inland 220

Jiangxi 100 Wenzhou 40

Statistics -

The supplementary record of the previous day's transactions is as follows:

Colleagues 110 Yunnan 460

Statistics 460

Total transactions for two days: 2,502

The Japanese yarn market: actual demand is still depressed, but market prices remain firm due to buyers' strong intention and unwillingness to sell easily if prices fall. The market is therefore stable. The current price for 20-count Shuiyue yarn is 328 yuan, but there are no transactions for February. The current price for 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 323 yuan, and the spot price for March and April is 328.5 yuan.

Currently, the spot price for 20-count cotton yarn, such as Double Horse, is already 395 yuan. Many readers want to know the actual cost and have requested this information. In order to satisfy readers' desire for knowledge, this newspaper will provide an example of the cost components of 20-count cotton yarn:

The above calculation is based on a yarn package using 350 catties of cotton (Sima weight). The cost of cotton per yarn package is 278.25 yuan. Adding manufacturing costs, operating expenses, miscellaneous expenses, and unified taxes totals 55 yuan. The net cost is 333.25 yuan. From this, the profit per yarn package can be calculated.

395 - (278.25 + 55.00) = 61.75

That is, the profit for each yarn package is 61.75 yuan.

However, this is just an example. The actual situation depends on the internal conditions of each yarn factory. (A)

Silk Industry

### Why Have Recent Silk Prices (Continued from 4th) Risen Excessively (Xiao He)

The above-mentioned reasons from foreign markets are more focused on general and principled reasons. Regarding the explanation of the excessive rise in silk prices, it also needs a chronological coincidence to break out in recent times, and still summarizes the silk numbers from New York last month - a kind of reaction caused by temporary reasons in the market - to tell us.

According to the report of the Silk Association of America, there is indeed a reason that can stimulate the rise of silk prices in the New York silk market in January, that is, in January, the actual sales of raw silk in the United States increased by 5,612 dan, and imports decreased by 6,172 dan. This made the ending inventory in New York at the end of January decrease by 4,724 dan. Not only that, in mid-February, the total amount of raw silk shipped to the United States from various places also decreased by a huge 12,700 dan compared with the previous month. This amount is nearly one-third of the usual total consumption of raw silk in New York. This situation stimulated the gradual rise in silk prices in the middle of the month, and the statistical figures have further promoted the rapid rise in silk prices this week.

Secondly, we must talk about the situation in the city.

In the anti-Japanese war's domestic silk-producing areas, the inability to maintain post-war output is expected, so Shanghai's silk market after the war is often detached from the trend of the world's silk market. At the same time, the operators of the local silk industry excessively ignored the foreign situation. So in the past year, when foreign countries were urgently absorbing and looking for 20-22 denier white silk, it gave foreign countries a bargain. This matter was admitted by an experienced silk industry person who admitted his negligence a few months ago. At the same time, due to this gentleman's reminder, most silk merchants also remembered the following phenomenon: Since September last year, all silk telegrams from Shanghai to New York, London, and Lyon, regardless of when or what market price, the foreign response was often unconditional acceptance of 20-22 denier raw silk, slightly lowering the price of 16-18 denier raw silk and accepting it. Third, all 13-15 denier raw silk was completely returned, without any attention. Under the negligence of this phenomenon, Shanghai silk manufacturers have completely emptied all recent goods. When the price of white raw silk advanced to 1100 yuan, the futures for December were almost empty. Then followed the skyrocketing silk prices, which soared smoothly to 1350 yuan. At this time, Shanghai white silk's delivery in February and March also already had owners.

In the second point of this aspect, we must think about the needs of Shanghai silk factories. Local silk factories have always used white raw silk returned by foreign firms as the main source of raw materials, because this kind of raw silk with a relatively decisive quality is cheaper when it hits a wall in foreign firms, and it is much more reliable than ordinary raw silk with no standard. Generally, silk factories are happy to buy it, but under the above-mentioned reasons, because of the urgent demand from foreign countries and the rising silk prices, it is rarely found to be returned by foreign firms, but silk prices extremely stimulated the consumer market, so silk factories had to compete for their own raw material sources at high prices. This resulted in the shift of the center of gravity of the silk market, with the silk prices of users about a hundred yuan higher than the import prices of foreign firms. The reason why silk factories are so eager for raw materials is, of course, still due to seasonal relations: winter and March are the weaving season for spring and summer silk materials, which is the time when the most silk is used. We should not forget this. This is the case not only in China, but also throughout the world.

Combining the above two parts of the reasons, the recent soaring silk prices are really the result of blind operation, and such a soaring silk price is not only not a place for the silk industry itself to be happy, but on the contrary, those who are under the pressure of this rising price are still their own people, and as a result, even the silk industry itself does not benefit.

"We are originally born from the same root, why should we be so eager to fight each other?" This sentence is sincerely dedicated to the silk merchants and silk factories.

### Sales of Native Cotton Also Weak

The price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, has been under discussion for many days due to the issue of Washington sealing the sale of government-funded cotton. It has not been resolved yet, so the cotton price is quite constrained. Most of the market transactions are spot and arbitrage. Factories' interest in current cotton is not as strong as before. Yesterday, it rose two pound coins. India stopped trading, and the forecast was unchanged. Egypt rose one or two pound coins. Yesterday, the exchange rate weakened again. Converted into legal currency, the price of cotton rose. US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 20 cents per dan, Indian cotton rose by 10 cents, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 30 cents.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is very quiet. Even the Japanese manufacturers have no intention of importing foreign cotton recently. On the Chinese factory side, Shenxin has stopped purchasing for a week, and there is no intention to purchase within the year. The Chinese factories in the Tianjin area, which are known for cotton production, also plan to purchase foreign cotton in Shanghai due to the lack of cotton in stock. They are now contacting Shanghai separately. The Japanese factories in North China also need cotton very urgently. Japanese merchants have transported a large amount of foreign cotton to Tianjin. Yesterday's trading was silent. The prices of foreign cotton are listed below:

The native cotton business is as sparse as the morning stars. The factory's appetite is not healthy, and the Japanese factories are indifferent. They have absolutely no intention of getting involved in native cotton. This is because the Indian ships arriving in Shanghai these days are extremely crowded. All the warehouses are full. The factories have sufficient raw materials for current use, more than enough. Therefore, although the sales of yarn and cloth have recovered, the current cotton is still dull. Only the new Xin Sheng spinning factory has some consumption, but the amount is very small. Goods from Northern Jiangsu: Tongzhou flower arrived 1,494 bales on the 5th, and 834 bales on the 6th. New Port cotton 290 pieces. The opening quotation and transaction volume of current cotton are recorded as follows:

Silk and Tea

### Silk Prices Still Climbing to New Highs, Jili Silk Cocoons Sold for 900 Yuan, Some Shipped to Europe

Yesterday's silk market, New York stopped trading, Yokohama spot price 913 yuan, closing price 930 yuan, forward price 903 yuan, afternoon closing price 912 yuan. However, the purchase price of white factory silk by British and French foreign firms was 1,460 yuan. Because the manufacturers held the price firmly, there was no transaction. Yinzhuang Jili silk black star grade has been sold for 900 yuan. The silk market is still climbing to new highs, so trading is not prosperous. Yesterday, the total transaction volume was 30 dans.

The day before yesterday (5th), 352 pieces of Lake silk and 162 pieces of silk waste were shipped to Europe, and 55 pieces of cocoons were shipped to France.

### Sugar Market: Rumor that Dutch Sugar Cannot be Re-exported in Xiamen, Few Offers for National Sugar

Yesterday, there was another rumor that Dutch sugar could not be re-exported in Xiamen, so the trend was still tight. The association quoted 24 yuan for foreign warehouse goods of No. 24 Dutch coarse white, 24 yuan 15 cents for local warehouse goods, and 24 yuan 25 cents for Da Jin Qian Mai. Re-exported Dutch coarse white, 16 yuan for outgoing, and 15 yuan 90 cents for incoming, without any agreement. No. 5 Dutch red spot, 200 bags traded at 16 yuan 55 cents. Re-exported goods were still 11 yuan. Taikoo car white B mark, 23 yuan 30 cents for delivery in the East Warehouse, and 23 yuan 45 cents for delivery in the West Warehouse, more than 500 bags traded. CX mark 23 yuan 15 cents in the East Warehouse, CW mark 23 yuan 20 cents, DY mark 23 yuan 10 cents, HX mark 23 yuan. The local factory's cotton white has not changed. Zhenji No. 1 is more than 25 yuan after tax refund. Local factory No. 1 ice 32 yuan 20 cents, the Chao Gang offered a batch of branch goods, the higher price was 16 yuan 50 cents to 16 yuan, and the final price was 15 yuan 80 cents to 15 yuan 30 cents, with a total transaction of more than 600 bags.

Yesterday, 120 pieces of sugar came from Beihai, 130 pieces from Haikou, and 200 bags from Shantou.

### Foreign Wheat Continues to Arrive in Shanghai, Reaching 25,000 Tons, Native Wheat Expensive and Flour Sales Not Smooth

Flour sales yesterday were slightly better than before. Because it was the beginning of the week, both buyers and sellers were more interested. Nanyang Gang No. 2 flour had sporadic transactions. The Northern Gang was flooded with local foreign flour, and the demand for Shanghai flour was not smooth. The by-product flour was attracting attention. The total market transaction volume of No. 2 and No. 4 flour was 20,000 to 30,000 bags each. Che Chuan Pai No. 2 flour was sold at the original price of 4 yuan 80 cents. No. 4 Red God of Wealth flour was sold for 4 yuan 20 cents, which was looser than before. The market has entered a high-fixed and then weak situation. Today's export, 5,500 bags of flour are shipped to Tianjin, 2,000 bags are shipped to Yantai, and 13,000 bags are shipped to Weihaiwei.

The wheat market showed a slight increase, because only 4,000 to 5,000 bags arrived in the last two days. The sellers of the newly arrived goods were unwilling to sell easily because of the high cost. The factories had previously ordered foreign wheat, and another ship continued to arrive. Their demand for domestic wheat was also slack, so the transaction was not smooth. The total market only offered Jiangbei and Wuhu wheat, a total of 3,000 bags. Jiangbei wheat 6 yuan 60 cents, Wuhu wheat price 6 yuan 20 cents to 5 yuan 90 cents. Fuxin Factory bought 2,000 bags, and Fufeng Factory bought 1,000 bags. The market increased by several cents due to the small amount of inventory.

Recently, American wheat has been continuously transported. In addition to those for disaster relief, there are also many factories that handle it themselves. Yitai Company's Rile.v wheel carried 8,383 tons, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. It is now reported that it will be imported this morning and berthed at No. 14. 15 floating pontoons for transshipment. The company's Jantze Fritzen, loaded with 8,893 tons, will arrive on the 19th. There is also Tianxiang Foreign Company's Harmatris wheel, loaded with 7,750 tons, which arrived the day before yesterday (5th) and is berthed at No. 17 and 18 floating pontoons. The American wheat loaded on the above-mentioned ships are all ordered by Da Fu Foreign Company on behalf of the factories.

### New Customer Xian Rice Stockpiled, Du Jing Sales Dim

Xian rice is actively stockpiled, and the market continues to rise. High-quality goods are becoming increasingly unavailable from Nanjing and other areas. Wuhu special high-quality Xian was raised to 10 yuan 85 cents yesterday. The general market goods all followed suit, rising by about 20 cents compared to last weekend. There were merchants inquiring about stockpiling yesterday, which was quite lively. The total transaction volume for the day increased to about 2,500 bags.

The source of domestic rice totaled He Xia No. 2, and Che Lun Bao Zi had 6,000 to 7,000 bags. With the arrival of a large amount of goods, people's hearts softened. In addition, after a period of strong sales, the appetites of the local street and merchants were full, resulting in a downturn in sales yesterday. However, because the sellers in the market still had strong intentions, the price was stable. As a result, the market for Bo Jing rice remained at the original price. Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian were stable, and the path for Yuan's departure was also weak, resulting in a lack of price fluctuations.

### Piece Goods: Although the Ningbo Cotton Weaving Industry Appealed, the Transaction Volume of Eastern Cloth Did Not Decrease

Domestic cloth from Sichuan, Yunnan, Shantou, and the local street's bleached grey cloth are still selling well. Local merchants are also working hard to absorb them. Both spot and forward goods have wholesale transactions. Yarn su silk and cotton fabric, both large and small shirt merchants in the local street have been mobilized, with daily transactions of 2,000 to 3,000 pieces. Sichuan merchants also have wholesale shipments. The opening price this year is 36-37 cents per yard, while the sales price last autumn was only 22-23 cents. 42-count yarn silk cotton fabric currently sells for 46-47 cents per yard in the market, compared to 34-35 cents last autumn. The price has increased by 30%. It is said that the main reason is the lack of imports of fine yarn money grey cloth from Japan after the war, and the sharp rise in the raw materials of Japanese factory New yarn and thread in the local port. It is said that before the war, more than 20,000 pieces of this fine yarn and thread grey cloth were transported here annually. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants are still selling well. Spot and forward goods are continuing to purchase more than 300 pieces. Shantou merchants are handling more than 100 boxes of fine twill fine cloth cotton fabric, color cloth, and blue cloth from factories such as Lun Chang. Merchants in the interior along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, such as Guangfeng, are adding more than 2,000 pieces of miscellaneous cotton cloth from wholesale stores in this city. Local merchants in this city are purchasing more than 100 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and Yihua coarse cloth produced by Shenxin Yong'an factories.

Yesterday, the market price of white fine cloth from the East increased slightly, with the price of each piece increasing by 25 cents. Tianjin merchants imported 300 packages of 12-pound fine cloth of various brands such as Longtou Caiqiu Feiyu Labao. Wholesale stores in the local street also added more than 300 pieces of fine cloth. The total amount of fine cloth futures contracts for February, March, and April thrown out reached 1,500 to 1,600 pieces. Ito Foreign Company offered the most, 900 pieces, Dongmian 400 pieces, and Nissin Jiang Shang each offered 200 to 300 packages. The prices are listed below: Nengtou fine cloth 12 yuan per piece, Feiyu fine cloth 12 yuan 10 cents, Labao fine cloth 11 yuan 70 cents, Lan Shuangyu fine cloth 11 yuan 60 cents, Longtou fine twill futures are priced at 11 yuan 75 cents, so there were no sales.

The Ningbo Weaving Industry Association previously stated that "the cotton weaving and knitting factories of the association members are restricted by government orders, and the dumping of Japanese goods in Shanghai—more than 90% of the cotton weaving, knitting, and dyeing industries in Shanghai use Japanese yarn and Japanese cloth. Their products are called domestic products, but are actually modified products of Japanese goods. If they are allowed to sell well in the interior, the financial resources will flow out, not only will the factories in the interior collapse, but also the wartime economy will be unsustainable." They requested the government to prohibit their transportation and sale in the interior. However, because empty words cannot be realized, the cotton weaving industries in Shanghai, which are making a fortune from the national crisis, are not moved and continue to do their own thing.

Today, 70 pieces of piece goods are exported to Tianjin, and 210 pieces are exported to Yantai.

### Seafood: Black and White Pepper Inventory Insufficient

The source of pepper is extremely scarce recently, and sales are quite active, resulting in the depletion of inventory. The current market price of No. 1 pepper is 61-62 yuan, black large pepper is 58-59 yuan, and Wendao white pepper is 95 yuan, an increase of 3-5 yuan compared to before. Today, Shandong wheel imported 30 pieces of sea cucumber.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Green Cakes Continue to Loosen

The price of green cakes in the recent market has continued to loosen. Ordinary packaged goods are slightly lower, opening at 12 yuan 30 cents. Boxed ranked cakes have also dropped by 40-50 cents, with the higher price opening at 13 yuan, and the final price at 12 yuan 50 cents. It is said that the demand from the interior has weakened slightly.

### Oil Cakes: Interior Adding New Year Goods, Soybean Oil Rises Suddenly by 30 Cents

Yesterday's soybean oil trading suddenly became lively, and the market rose suddenly by 20-30 cents. This is because the interior is adding New Year goods, and the market is in the process of closing, with few sellers, resulting in a soaring market atmosphere. The total market traded 400-500 barrels of Dalian spot soybean oil. It opened at 28 yuan 20 cents in the morning, and each transaction gradually increased, resulting in a closing price of 28 yuan 35 cents. Since a batch of peanut oil, which was rained on, was sold off, people's hearts were once hit. Recently, the potential trend has stabilized, and the market has also maintained the original price. It is estimated that 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded yesterday, and the price is still 21 yuan.

### Hardware: Yellow Steel Wire Trading Prosperous, Black Iron Billets Selling Well in Tianjin

Yellow Steel Wire: Recently, due to the good environment, the trend is rising. However, spring factories, thermos bottle factories, and iron bed factories are in urgent need, resulting in the depletion of Ishtar-brand varieties on the market. The Yantai and Tianjin gangs are also constantly purchasing for fishing hooks, so the trading to the Japanese market is frequent. The total volume reached 600-700 dans. Therefore, the circulation of goods on the market is extremely weak, and the sellers have raised prices one after another. For example, Zu Hua is priced at 17 yuan per dan in the market, the middle-grade variety is sold at 18 yuan 50 cents, and the fine variety is priced at around 20 yuan. As for a kind of mixed goods, it is priced at around 15 yuan per dan. However, the actual transactions have been smooth for days, and people's hearts are very good.

Black Iron Billets: The Tianjin gang has been purchasing for days, such as Yongji and Wantai, purchasing more than 300 tons (estimated at more than 6,000 dans), resulting in the exhaustion of spot goods on the market. However, due to the end of the year, the holders are eager to sell, so there is a sigh of decline. The initial price was 29 yuan (calculated per 200 pounds), and it gradually returned to 28 yuan 45 cents. The price of forward goods sold was 38 yuan 30 cents. However, the retail price of each box in the local street is still 29 yuan to 29 yuan 25 cents.

### Paper: Tin Foil Prices Increase for Year-End Sales

Tin Foil: Recently, due to the need for the New Year, the digestion is increasing day by day. The source is that the labor force in the place of origin is lacking, and the production volume cannot meet expectations. Therefore, although the price of tin, the raw material, has fallen back, the cost of labor has increased. The retail sales of each store are difficult to make a profit due to the high miscellaneous expenses. Therefore, the wholesale price of each piece still maintains the original price, and the retail price of each piece in the store continues to increase by 2 cents.

### Coal: Anthracite Coal is in Short Supply

Wenzhou large basket anthracite coal has been in short supply recently, and the price is firm. It is found that the current number of units shipped from the Oujiang River is only more than 1,000 dans in total. It is said that the price is 5 yuan 20 cents per dan for a 40-pound large basket, 4 yuan 40 cents for a 30-pound basket, 3 yuan 80 cents for a flat basket of Qi Qing, and 1 yuan 80 cents for a small basket of He Tan. The same industry Yangjingbang wharf arranges car delivery, adding another 5 cents per dan for the car force.

### Import and Export: Bulk Goods Shipped to Europe, Medicinal Materials Also Imported

The day before yesterday (5th), a large amount of goods was shipped to Europe, including 170 pieces of yarn waste, 10 pieces of leather, 209 boxes of leaves, 20 pieces of intestines, 15 pieces of hair, 25 pieces of egg yolk, 8 pieces of rhubarb, and 844 pieces of tobacco leaves. There were also 14,300 pieces of paper shipped to Qingdao.

Yesterday's imports included 830 pieces of tobacco leaves from Ningbo, 980 pieces of paper, 8 pieces of wool crepe from Tianjin, and 2,600 pieces of goods from Shantou.

Also, this issue's Guangdong wheel arrived at the port, carrying 32 pieces of medicinal materials from Haiphong, 5 pieces of galangal from Hong Kong, and 77 pieces of fruit peel.

### Jiangsu and Zhejiang Education Departments Promote Education in Guerrilla Areas: Private Schools Established in Jiangsu, and Education Groups Established in Zhejiang

Since August 13th, due to the environmental conditions in various guerrilla areas, all primary schools have been suspended, except for a portion of secondary and above schools that have been relocated. This has caused a feeling that school-age children in various areas cannot attend school. The Ministry of Education has paid great attention to this point and has already formulated an entire implementation plan, which has been circulated to all provinces and cities for implementation. The implementation of education in the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is recorded below:

Private Village Schools Established in Jiangsu Province: Regarding the implementation of education in the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu Province, since the establishment of the various guerrilla area county governments, each county has been assigned a county education director, so the administrative structure of education in the guerrilla areas has been established. In addition to planning to restore primary schools at all levels, it has been decided to use the form of private schools in villages, secretly established in various villages. At the same time, a mobile approach is adopted, and the location is not fixed. The counties of Tong, Chong, Qi, and Hai have successively implemented this, and it has been quite effective.

Mobile Education Adopted in Zhejiang Province: The implementation of education in the guerrilla areas of Zhejiang Province has completely adopted a mobile approach. Last month, five mobile education groups were added to teach the people in the various guerrilla areas of Western Zhejiang.

### On Jiuqu Ridge

— Shao Guang

In the twelfth lunar month, snow is falling in the sky,

The plum blossoms on Jiuqu Ridge,

Are blooming in profusion.

Among the lonely flower shadows,

The muzzles of small cannons are hidden.

Solid trenches are dug on the mountainside,

Flickering with the shadows of guards.

"Come and die, you enemies at the foot of the mountain!"

A loyal and brave machine gunner,

Says excitedly and calmly,

His face full of a confident smile.

Clap, clap, clap...

The sound of guns striking the enemy rings out,

In a tense moment,

Dozens of corpses lie diagonally on the snowy ground,

Crimson blood, portraying

The crimes and cruelty of the invaders!

Poor dead ghosts,

Who told you to leave your homeland, abandon your wives and children,

And come here to commit suicide and murder?

What are you doing all this for?

The flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun,

Smiles on the high ridge,

The cry of victory in the War of Resistance,

Surges in the snowflakes.

Plum blossoms in profusion,

Send out wisps of fragrance,

As if to commend the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers.

The vast wilderness shows no trace of the enemy,

They have been defeated—

And fled into a dead city ten miles away.

Ah, this heroic battle,

Has given the enemy another serious lesson!

### The Garden Full of Spring Cannot Be Contained

### Writing

— Chi Qiang

Write, write, write...

Keep writing, but what exactly should one write about?

Yes, the most important thing is the heroic spirit of valor; sketch it out in a couple of strokes, and soon a magnificent and typical character will emerge; keep moving.

But, I can't handle the majestic images of Liangshan heroes? If the beginning is wrong, don't show off your ax near Lu Ban’s door; everyone understands this. Besides, a smart person often laughs at fools for blindly blundering and doing something thankless.

"Love between men and women," write something tearful, okay?

No! What era is this, friend? Who will accept your "sobbing" and "playing the qin and singing loudly"?

I can't write, that's it! Can't write anything. Close the door to get rid of greasy, fishy smells, cut off the gossamer threads of "drifting with ease"— the drifting filaments.

However, "Those who aspire can do likewise," either don't do it, or do it thoroughly. Small items of literary work, miscellaneous family possessions, rouse your spirits, come on! Don't casually let go of the little birds that habitually hover without landing in your thoughts or imagination. Reopen the mind that was closed; might as well carve out a few sentences. Be honored to contribute to the victory of the War of Resistance!

Something superficially flashy, alas! I've racked my brains, but can't find a single sentence. Probably a "skillful hand" would produce something even without "searching," and it would be "crisp and loose":

"The moon shines on a thousand pools, reflecting the cold emerald of West Lake on a big night..."

Another one with ulterior motives is here. Look, wake up; the era is turning that way. Shouldn't you turn around and catch up?

Here's something standardized:

Be careful what you write; write about what you know. Don't dwell on old dreams, and you should always study what the objective environment accepts and rejects. It is best to "transform" it with "spirit." I really feel like I'm about to give up.

Immediately, many people who pretend to know or are familiar with reality emerge. Write it out for those who don't know to read; perhaps everyone, in this moment of ignorance, will understand with a divine revelation and naturally piece together a kind of "of course" public opinion. This public opinion will soon "unite," so the "Eight-legged essay of the War of Resistance" (maybe a few legs short, since I don't have an authorized edition to verify) immediately becomes the number one "worn-out broom" in the literary world.

Speaking of "worn-out brooms," everyone would honestly and impolitely "cherish" them, even though they are decaying and powerless; even cleaning the house is difficult. However, if you say it doesn't deserve to be called a broom and kick it away, it will definitely stare at you, and there will be hatred between the creator and you. The most unbearable thing is the suspicion of "dividing the forces of resistance." Therefore, the literary world is crowded with this kind of person. For more than a year, how many works of art that deeply touched people's hearts have we seen?

"Don't please the enemy," cover up a bit, just accept it. It is said that after "aiming the gun outward," the wind of concealing evil and praising good immediately becomes pervasive and paralyzing. Being able to not be a traitor is enough to be content. A hundred and twenty million compatriots are misled; is it not "laborious" to "love" them? How much has the writing class achieved in terms of "labor"?

I will apologize to Yan Da in advance: I'm sorry I'm here again to stir up trouble and make mischief. Compatriots! We are all compatriots on the same front.

However, what I see are just compatriots, and more compatriots.

Avoiding the noise and dust, dispelling the hot blood, opening up cold doors, burning cold stoves, three or five friends, solemnly "our path is not lonely," promoting the "plump buttocks," collecting erotic photos from home and abroad, writing leisurely and contented articles.

A passionate young man, also a compatriot, said that he shouldn't be too far away from the reality of the times, and explained the meaning in a subtle way. The argument was said to be like this:

"As long as you don't write the plump buttocks as shriveled bellies, it's also reality!" Only then did I understand everything in front of me, and what is called "unity" and "united front" is all based on eating one’s fill. So I picked up my pen.

### Profile of a Dictator (Part 1)

— Translated by Zhe Fei

Stalin

At home in the evening, in the living room of a private apartment in the center of Soviet City, a shaded electric lamp emitted a harmonious and warm light. The light fell on a piano and on a slender young girl with black hair playing the piano. In a corner, a burly man with grayish-white hair combed back, a drooping mustache at the corner of his mouth, and a forehead full of thoughtful lines, sat quietly listening, his thoughtful gaze looking ahead.

The girl's name was Svetlana, only twelve years old, the daughter of the dictator of one hundred sixty-five million Russians, and the man listening to the piano was her father.

Only when his daughter was playing the piano in the evening could Stalin temporarily forget his responsibilities, the conspiracies around him, his illnesses, and his vigilance against assassination.

Svetlana was the daughter of Stalin's second wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, who had died six years earlier. Stalin saw a shadow of his wife in his daughter, and for her mother's sake, he caressed his daughter with a human warmth that was a striking contrast to his coldness as a dictator.

He also particularly doted on her. Svetlana was the most lively and lovable of his three children, one of whom was the son of his first wife, now twenty-one years old, and the other was seventeen-year-old Vasily, the son of Nadezhda. A loyal nanny was always with her, and two or three special detectives guarded her in secret.

Like other Russian children, she attended a national school, but had a tutor at home who specialized in English. She liked to listen to fairy tales and loved to play tennis and ice skate, but her greatest love was for her father, and her wishes were like commands to him.

She was raised with the ideals of the Soviet Republic, and she would have to fulfill the tasks of a Soviet public servant in the future. However, Stalin had recently even become jealous of her study time. He knew he might not have many years left, so he longed for his little daughter to be by his side, because only she could make him feel calm and at peace.

### Birthday

— Ping Hen

Evening.

The round moon in the east quietly climbs up the treetops, faintly, with a wry smile on its face. Who is it? Someone must have had a frustrating experience.

…When my wise brother mentions his hometown, Ziqing can't help but shed tears. Let's go to the Looking-Hometown Terrace together; I wonder where our hometown is…

A bright sound of Jinghu (京胡) came over, so how could there be any frustration, the singing, the music, it truly is the most refined and moving music in the evening.

An old man walked over to me, as if he was my grandfather, with white hair, a bent beard, pursed lips, and gently asked: "How was the yaoban (搖板) section I just sang?"

"Not bad."

"Child! Have you forgotten? On your first, tenth, and twentieth birthdays, and even now, someone has been singing nice operas for you to listen to, and you won't forget it, now they are singing operas to celebrate your birthday."

"What? Celebrate my birthday?"

There was no grandfather there; my shadow was faintly printed on the ground. I stared at the shadow in a daze; how could it be, my birthday is today.

I lowered my head to think:

My loving mother caressed my hair and said softly: "Child! Today is your birthday, are you still wandering alone outside and not coming home?"

"What? I still have a home?"

"Silly child! Look."

There was no loving mother there, it was still just me alone, this is too strange, why is my birthday today. I looked up again at the moon; it was round and had climbed a lot higher, probably today is my birthday, I remember my birthday is always when the moon is round.

"Mom! I'm having a birthday again today," a child said to his mother.

"You jinx, having a birthday, whose life are you wasting?" a harsh voice said.

The child's cry broke through the evil atmosphere. The awakened me stood under the moonlight in a daze, forgetting everything, forgetting what I had just thought about.

Alone, without a place to settle down anywhere in the world, forget my birthday, as long as I have my life, I will have my birthday.

Hometown, everywhere is my hometown, my birthday, forget it, and forget hometown just like my birthday, I will think about my birthday again when I arrive in my hometown.

A silver light flashed across the sky, dazzling. It was a silly person, his mind stimulated, thinking or remembering, or triggered by the scenery, wandering under the silver light. Quickly catch up with the silver light! Seek a ray of hope.

The moon is smiling again.

Evening.

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

2.  Escaping and Going to the Disaster

Mr. Ye's house was located on the edge of the city near the fields, quite a distance from the township office. Commander Ye supported his father as they walked home, his bronze-colored square face seemed to be covered with a layer of dark clouds, appearing very gloomy.

As they walked along, the road that had been bustling when they came had suddenly become very deserted after the bombing. The shops had all closed their doors and were no longer doing business. In some houses, people were shouting and talking, vaguely saying that a bomb had fallen on the Wanchun Sauce Garden, killing seven people. The sauce jars had all been shattered, and eight houses had collapsed before and after, injuring many people. Mr. Ye shuddered, but didn't say anything. Commander Ye kept biting his lip, his eyes shooting out firm and angry light. And so they came to their house.

Mr. Ye lived in a three-bay, two-courtyard, three-story building. When they arrived, the door wasn't closed. They pushed the door open and went inside, but there was no one to be seen. No one knew where his family had gone. Commander Ye finally called out in the courtyard, and his younger brother Fang Ying ran out from under the back door staircase, saying:

"Big brother, we're all here."

Commander Ye pushed open the screen door at the back and looked inside, unable to help but burst into laughter. He saw straw spread under the staircase, and his mother Mrs. Ye, younger sister Fang Hui, youngest brother Fang Wen, and the servants were all huddled together sitting on the ground, with a wet cloth shirt covering Mrs. Ye's neck. This ridiculous sight made him unable to hold back his laughter for a long time, he just pointed at them and said:

"Come out quickly! You don't even have any basic air raid knowledge! How can such a fragile staircase protect you from bombs? If you are squeezed together like this, and a bomb really falls on you, wouldn't everyone be finished."

Mrs. Ye lifted the wet cloth shirt covering her head and stood up from the ground, her face pale and bloodless. As she walked out of the screen door, she repeatedly patted her chest, saying:

"Oh dear! So scary! Did the ×× plane leave already? That loud bang just now was really terrifying!"

"It's already gone far away, Mom, don't worry, it's okay," Commander Ye comforted his mother.

"Fang Jun," Mr. Ye called out in a very calm voice from the east wing, pacing back and forth in the room holding his white copper water pipe. When Commander Ye walked into the room, he sat down and pointed at the chair opposite him with the paper coal in his hand, saying: "Sit down, I have something to talk to you about."

At this time, Mrs. Ye also brought her children into the room, and everyone's eyes were focused on Commander Ye's face, as if everyone's fate was waiting for him to make the final decision. Mr. Ye took a puff of his pipe, blew the ashes onto the ground, and then began to speak to Commander Ye: (6)

Commentary

### The Professional Ethics of a Doctor

— Feng Zhiyin

The wise men of old said, "If one cannot be a good prime minister, then one should be a good doctor." The positions of doctor and prime minister are vastly different, and comparing them seems inappropriate. However, their intentions are the same: to benefit and assist others. Benevolence and skillful practice are essential, and in a broader sense, this is morality. It is said that only those with high moral character can hold the position of prime minister without shame. Similarly, only those with high moral character can wield the power of medicine without feeling unworthy of being called a good doctor. Treating people is akin to governing a country, and the ancients revered doctors for this reason, as does society today. However, I ask, even if their titles are noble, their knowledge profound, their skills proficient, and their instruments excellent, if their hearts are impure and they prioritize profit over service, it is difficult for them to truly benefit the people, and they are unworthy of being called good doctors. Furthermore, those who lack expertise and engage in deceit cause even greater harm to society, which is unimaginable. It is no wonder that the world feels that doctors are a mixed bag and gradually develops a sense of disdain and contempt, a stark contrast to the ancients who equated them with good prime ministers. This is simply due to a lack of professional ethics. As the saying goes, "People must first insult themselves before others will insult them." When it comes to professions, there are countless variations, and each has its own set of ethics to uphold, but the medical field is paramount. When people unfortunately suffer from illness and groan in pain, their desire for a doctor's treatment is akin to an infant reaching for its mother's loving embrace. How urgent is their expectation! If a doctor treats patients differently based on their social class or the level of compensation, and takes the treatment lightly, they have failed in their sacred mission. How much more so if they prioritize profit and disregard human life? Such people have forgotten the nobility of their profession and have descended to the level of shamans and sorcerers, a lowly and despicable group, which is truly lamentable! To be a doctor, one must not only have excellent knowledge and skills, and be equipped with the necessary instruments and tools, but also attach great importance to moral principles. Medicine is a charitable profession, with the highest goal being to benefit others. Without a compassionate and empathetic heart, and a sense of suffering alongside the patient, the goal is misguided, and the consequences are unpredictable. What value does such a profession hold for the individual? What value does such a doctor hold for society? Since I began practicing medicine more than a decade ago, I have deeply regretted my lack of expertise and the obscurity of my name. However, I have strived to uphold professional ethics and have never dared to waver in my commitment. I have no grand theories about morality; it is simply the innate goodness that everyone possesses, allowing one to act with a clear conscience. I write this to encourage myself and to share it with my fellow medical professionals.

Common Knowledge about Diseases

### Stomach Ailments (Part 2)

— Zhuang Weizhong

In addition to the aforementioned common type of chronic gastritis, there is also chronic gastritis caused by syphilis or tuberculosis, which will be discussed in detail later.

Gastritis is an organic disease with corresponding pathological changes, which are beyond the scope of common knowledge. Therefore, I can only provide a general overview. In acute gastritis, the mucous membrane will definitely undergo significant changes, even affecting the deeper layers (the stomach tissue is divided into three layers: the mucous membrane, the muscle layer, and the serous membrane). These changes include erosion, which can develop into ulcers, and even perforation of the serous membrane. Glandular secretions are also affected. In chronic gastritis, there are two pathological types: atrophic and hypertrophic. All these pathological changes are closely related to clinical practice.

Leaving aside pathological changes, let's discuss the symptoms of gastritis. Since gastritis is divided into acute and chronic types, the symptoms, whether subjective (felt by the patient) or objective (observed by others), will differ, but there are also similarities, only varying in severity.

First, let's discuss the symptoms of acute gastritis. The key symptoms include severe stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, fever, and a thick coating on the tongue. Stomach pain is almost always present in acute gastritis, but the nature of the pain is not as specific as in ulcers. Vomiting is not always present, but in most patients with acute gastritis, the body's natural defense mechanism attempts to eliminate harmful stomach contents, or vomiting occurs as a result of stimulation reflexes caused by stomach contents. Frequent vomiting can be unbearable for the patient. Initially, the vomit consists of stomach contents, but later it may contain mucus. If there is erosion or ulceration, there may be blood in the vomit, but this is rare. After vomiting ordinary stomach contents, the patient feels refreshed. With proper treatment, vomiting can be prevented from recurring. Some patients only experience belching and nausea without vomiting. Furthermore, acute gastritis often occurs in conjunction with enteritis. When enteritis is present, diarrhea is common, but not always. Some patients with acute gastritis experience constipation. In acute gastritis, fever is usually not very high, or there may be no fever at all. However, children with the disease often have a fever of around 39 degrees Celsius. As for the thick coating on the tongue, it is almost always present in patients with acute gastritis. The patient's appetite is already reduced, and the coating on the tongue further impairs their sense of taste, making them even less inclined to eat. Acute gastritis caused by corrosive substances (i.e., toxic gastritis) causes more severe pain, and the vomit often contains blood, even vomiting blood.

Now, let's discuss the symptoms of chronic gastritis. Patients experience reduced appetite, indigestion, a frequent feeling of bloating in the stomach, thirst, bad breath, nausea, belching, and sometimes vomiting. The tongue may also have a coating, and the patient often suffers from constipation. These symptoms are common to all chronic stomach diseases and are not unique to the so-called common type of chronic gastritis. In general medical practice, when patients exhibit these symptoms, they are provisionally diagnosed with chronic gastritis. However, to be honest, these symptoms are merely a group of signs. In addition to tentatively labeling it as "chronic gastritis," it is important to carefully examine the patient to determine the underlying cause. Purely common type of chronic gastritis without other diseases is actually rare. Scientifically speaking, the stomach may not have inflammatory changes even if these symptoms are present. Therefore, to make a definite diagnosis of "chronic gastritis," there must be sufficient evidence of inflammatory changes. It is especially important to consider past symptoms, examine stomach fluids, and assess the overall condition before making a decision. Furthermore, it should be noted that this disease is often a symptom of other diseases, and careful examination is needed to determine if there are any other underlying conditions. Common Knowledge about Diseases

### The Currently Spreading Smallpox (Continued)

— Nie Chuanxian

The causes and symptoms of smallpox in general: The cause of smallpox is a filterable virus, or it is said to be caused by a certain bacterium, but no one has been able to confirm this theory so far. The general progression of smallpox is usually divided into four stages. The first is the incubation period, which is the period from the time the virus enters the body until the onset of the disease, usually twelve to fourteen days. During this period, the patient does not feel any different. The second is the onset period, during which the patient suddenly feels chills, shivering, and a rapid rise in body temperature to 39 to 40 degrees Celsius. At the same time, severe headaches, back pain, vomiting, loss of appetite, and a flushed face occur. After three or four days, the patient enters the third stage, which is the rash stage. Initially, bright red, raised papules appear, spreading from the face to the whole body. These develop into vesicles and finally into pustules, which eventually form scabs. The fourth stage is the desquamation stage, which often leaves permanent scars, commonly known as "pockmarks."

The dangers of smallpox: To date, there is no effective treatment for smallpox in medicine, and the mortality rate is also not low. In children who have not been vaccinated and contract smallpox, death is very common. There are many atypical cases of smallpox, such as hemorrhagic type and confluent type, which are almost always fatal. There are also many complications during the course of the disease, such as conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers, which can lead to lifelong disability, and bronchitis, tracheitis, and pneumonia, which often become the cause of death. It is known that there have been many dangerous cases in a certain isolation hospital this year, especially the hemorrhagic type, which has been seen frequently. At the same time, there are many adult patients, which is not what we usually imagine, that smallpox infection mostly occurs in children. This should be given special attention. (To be continued)

Common Disease Prevention Knowledge

### Simple Disinfection Methods for the Families of Patients with Infectious Diseases (Part 2)

— Zhu Yanggao

(2) Concluding Disinfection

Concluding disinfection is performed after the patient has recovered or died. All the patient's rooms, as well as all the equipment or items they contained, are thoroughly disinfected to ensure that all germs are eliminated and do not harm others.

The patient's room and nearby rooms suspected of being contaminated should be wiped with a 3% carbolic acid solution. All floors, tables, chairs, beds, benches, and all furniture in the room must be wiped very thoroughly. All crevices must also be injected with disinfectant. If the walls are whitewashed, they must be repainted. If they are bare wooden walls, they should also be wiped with dilute carbolic acid solution. After washing with disinfectant, then wash them again with hot water and soap with a brush. Clothes, bed curtains, and other cloth items can be gathered and boiled. Mattresses should be sprayed with disinfectant, such as dilute carbolic acid solution or 1% formalin solution, and then dried in the sun. Books, newspapers, paper items, toys, and other items can be burned directly. If the patient's room can be tightly closed, after the above procedures are completed, the following method can be used for disinfection to ensure thorough disinfection. The method is also very easy and inexpensive. However, before implementation, all air leaks in the room must first be sealed with paper and paste. Then, use the following gaseous disinfectant for sterilization. However, the amount of chemicals used must be determined by the size of the room. Therefore, the volume of the room must first be calculated, i.e., height multiplied by width, and then multiplied by length. For example, if a room is 4 meters high, 3 meters wide, and 6 meters long, then its volume is 72 cubic meters. The amount of chemicals required for each cubic meter is briefly described below:

Paraform 10.0 grams

Natrium bicarbonate 5.0 grams

Water 50.0 cc

Mix the above three items together and place them in a large enamel pot. Then, gradually add 25.0 grams of Kalium Permanganicum to the above liquid. However, when adding it, add it in small amounts gradually (do not pour it all in at once), otherwise, it is easy to overheat, erupt, and injure people around. Then use a wooden stick to stir evenly, put it in the room, and the people and animals in the room should leave immediately, close the doors tightly, and let it evaporate to disinfect for seven hours before opening the door. However, because the remaining gas still has an irritating effect, the windows and doors must be opened immediately to circulate the air and dissipate the gas.

Spring and Autumn

### Avoiding Talk and Avoiding Treatment

— Sangzi

Chinese people have a common problem, which is "avoiding talk and avoiding treatment." Therefore, all work and all diseases are buried and sacrificed under this psychology and spirit of "avoiding talk and avoiding treatment." We believe that for work to improve or progress, and for diseases to turn around or be eradicated, it is necessary to thoroughly examine and critique all aspects of work, from which we can discover the shortcomings in the work; and to carefully examine and diagnose the crux of all diseases, from which we can discover the truth of the disease; and then we can plan the development or prescribe the right medicine. But the key to this is the honest and frank confession of the worker or the patient's family. However, in general, patients' families, because of shame and disgust, have never been willing to reveal private matters, so the work can never progress, the disease can never be eliminated, and today's political pathology and physiological defects have been formed.

Recently, the Central Executive Committee believes that the current national affairs are difficult and dangerous, and that there are many things to be done. It is a time to taste the gall and sleep on firewood, not a time of peace and comfort. Staff members should be diligent and cautious, and do their best to serve the Party and the country. However, recently there have still been incidents of drinking and feasting, and indulging in entertainment at will. If this continues, how can we establish a career and be a role model? In order to rectify discipline, reverse the trend, and arouse the spirit of resisting aggression and building the country, a special order has been issued to all subordinates to absolutely prohibit staff members from gambling, dancing, prostitution, and other improper entertainment. This is a measure of not avoiding talk, and a necessary facility during the War of Resistance, which is worthy of our praise.

Gambling, dancing, prostitution, and other improper entertainment exist everywhere, but are most prevalent in Shanghai and Hong Kong; the number of staff members who commit this error is not small, and the number of ordinary people who are immersed in it is even greater. In gambling dens, people shout and gamble; in brothels, the lights are red and the wine is green; in dance halls, people embrace and dance. These things not only waste energy, but also consume foreign exchange. This is a dangerous phenomenon and a serious loss in China during the War of Resistance. We hope that after receiving this order, staff members will be alert, and that compatriots will realize the situation after seeing this news. At the same time, this spirit of not avoiding talk can be expanded and applied to general work!

### Talking About Women in "Tears on the Flowers"

— Yu Ling

—Answering a Question from a Miss—

(1) A Joke

—Mr., let me tell you a joke, a joke about you.—After Miss sat down, she looked at me suspiciously, smiling shyly and reservedly.

—A joke? About me?

—Yes, in the past, there was Yu Jing, who often had scripts published in "Women's Life." After publishing in "Night Light Cup," many small newspapers listed Yu Jing in the group of female writers. Now you have written "Women's Apartment" and "Tears on the Flowers," isn't that also...

—Haha, a joke. Actually, I don't understand women very well. SY knows that very well...

She just smiled, which made me a little embarrassed!

(2) Please Don't Torture My Models

—Mr., I know you can't dance, but...

—But I know some respectable dancers. Their understanding and background...

—I heard that the dancers in your "Tears on the Flowers" are based on real models... I want to...

—Oh, no, Miss, please don't torture my models, because I only know them, I can't say I understand them, let alone...

I heard that the characters in "Women's Apartment" have models, there are really such people, and...

—Oh, no, Miss... "Women's Apartment" is even more a completely fictitious creation. First of all, in terms of the background, there is no such "Women's Apartment" in Shanghai at all. As for the characters, it is even more...

—Aren't some of the heroines very similar to our familiar friends?

—Oh, then it can only be said to be a coincidence. I really didn't intend to write about anyone. Mr. Lu Xun said it well, his Ah Q is not about one or two people...

—Yes, I have also read Mr. Lu Xun's words about Ah Q's model.

(3) I Sympathize with Them

—Mr.: Do you sympathize with the dancers in your "Tears on the Flowers"?

—Sympathize: How could I write about them if I didn't sympathize with them?

—Who do you sympathize with the most? Among the dancers...

—I sympathize with Mimi, and even more with Gu Xiaomei, and even Manli!

### The Realization of a Hope

— Wu Yonggang

Before accepting the position of directing "Tears on the Flowers" for the Shanghai Drama Society, I hoped that the film practitioners and theater friends who remained on the isolated island should join hands more closely, cooperate and unite our spirits, and exchange and strengthen our strength. When I returned to the film studio, my personal conclusion was that the strength we had cultivated in the past seemed too weak in this stormy era of great change, although this force was constantly growing due to the needs of the battle.

A few months of intense life inevitably gave me a valuable lesson, and at the same time made me see clearly the weaknesses of our own that were exposed. This is an undeniable fact. The Chinese film industry is an infant that has suffered many disasters and has not developed properly. Because of its short history and poor nutrition, it is naturally quite difficult to shoulder such a heavy responsibility today, and many weaknesses are therefore exposed. This is within our expectations; but the exposure of weaknesses is also the elimination of corruption. Next, what we urgently need to address is the issue of how to replenish this incomplete and tired team.

This issue is not only happening in the film industry, but in any department, and so is the theater, which is closest to the film industry. Although the theater views me with unfamiliar eyes, I am very concerned and always look for opportunities to present my latent enthusiasm to the theater, because I understand that theater and film are inseparable brothers. Because of mutual assistance and cooperation, more brilliant flowers will bloom. Considering the achievements of stage actors on the screen, I feel that we need to join hands more closely, not only to encourage and urge each other, but we will inevitably be able to quickly establish a new team due to the concentration of power.

Therefore, I boldly and without thinking took on the role of director of "Tears on the Flowers" as my first attempt to direct a stage play. I hope to obtain research methods from learning, and I also plan to accumulate many times of learning again and again in the hope of gaining some experience. At the same time, this is also the realization of one of my hopes, which makes me very happy. However, I am also very worried, and I always doubt my ability to do the job. I know that for more important things for everyone, everyone will give me criticism and guidance.

### To a Friend in the Dance World

— Lan Lan

××:

Although we only met once in a chance encounter, your graceful figure accompanied by your kind soul is always lingering in my heart.

××, please forgive me, in the past, I have never judged you and other sisters based on the views of ordinary superficial people, especially because I am a woman myself, I can clearly understand all the pain and misfortune of women living in this male-centered society, but to be honest, before I met you, I never expected that in such a dark and dirty environment, a pure white lotus like you would actually be produced, growing in the turbid mud.

Do you remember when you frankly told me about your touching experiences, I was also secretly wiping tears with you? ××, I want to tell you, when I was playing Mimi in "Tears on the Flowers," listening to the flowery words of a despicable man and committing suicide by taking poison, I couldn't restrain myself anymore and cried out loud!

The Mimi I played, no matter in personality, behavior, or thought, is not exactly the same as you, but ×× you know, her experience is exactly the same as yours.

Yes, as you said, in the beginning, you and the other sisters were anesthetized by "material enjoyment." Think about it, at home, you are confined to a small and dirty room, and you are beaten and scolded by your stepmother all day long, but suddenly you are in a brilliant and gorgeous stage, the music, the lights, and several times more, the guests take you to tour, or to put it more clearly, those so-called "upper class" dance customers show off their luxurious lives, cars, restaurants, hotels, department stores, and tall buildings to you with a little pride, you are anesthetized, and with the white and bright money of the "upper class" dance customers deceiving you, you are even more anesthetized, so anesthetized that you bury your chastity.

I understand you very well, ××, when you said that men can play with women, and women can also play with men, and use men, but then you said again that women are subject to innate restrictions, childbirth, and easy aging. You have personally seen a companion die from an abortion, and you have personally seen a companion being abandoned because her beauty faded.

That's right, why, being the same people, do you have to be a dancer? Why in this society are dancers played with, trampled on, and despised at the same time? ××, you quickly answered this question yourself, who destroyed your home? Who killed your father and brothers? Who forced you, forced many sisters to be dancers? Who?

"Tears on the Flowers" is limited by objective conditions and cannot speak freely, but if the Mimi I play can influence or awaken many sisters in the dance world to live a meaningful and valuable life, then not only will I be happy myself, I think you will also feel fortunate! Best wishes for your efforts!

### About "Tears on the Flowers"

— Xia Xia

I remember it was one night, I finished rehearsing "Tears on the Flowers" and returned home, a friend came to chat with me, it was raining lightly outside, and the raindrops hitting the balcony were very clear, so we could hear them, my friend asked me: "What do you think of the script of "Tears on the Flowers"? I lowered my head and gently answered him, I think it's great."

Yes, I think this is a good play, no, no, I simply feel that this is not a play—it is a fact, it is a real exposure. You can see on the newspapers every day, there are too many similar things, I think—please forgive me, a person who doesn't understand art, for talking nonsense—artistic works should not be too far away from facts, especially in this great era, the closer artistic works are to facts, the richer they are in true emotion, and the higher their value is. Thinking of Du Fu (the name "Tears on the Flowers" is originally the name of a poem by Du Fu), the sage of poetry, why are his poems so worshiped? Isn't it because his poems completely grasp the real facts and are completely the outpouring of true feelings?—Please forgive me again, I don't understand poetry and literature and I'm talking nonsense.

There are four dancers in "Tears on the Flowers," four different types of dancers, I cry for Xiaomei, I worry for Manli, I sympathize with Mimi, and I admire Dingxiang. Although I play Dingxiang, the shadows of the other three people often revolve in my mind, and I often think in my heart, who created these unequal tragedies in the society?

Speaking of the script, I can't help but think of Mr. Yu Ling, this passionate playwright. I am very honored to have played many characters under his pen. Although I am not worthy and dare not say that I understand him, I can't help but admire him: I admire his emotions for the tears of the masses, and his spirit for the sweat of the masses. He often exposes those dark and ugly corners of society. He is always shouting and calling for those who are oppressed. We all know that he still has a lot of things hidden in his stomach that he hasn't said—see the preface to Tears on the Flowers—so for him, and also for ourselves, I hope that the day when he can say everything as much as possible will come soon!

Chapter Three: Gazing Upon the Remains, Recalling the Old Patriot; Opening Literacy Class, Questioning Words to the Little Teacher

Jin Danyun and the others escorted the two Miss He's to the hotel. The ladies insisted that the engaged couple stay for supper before allowing them to return. The hotel was quite different from the Lingcun restaurant they had visited during the day, being much more luxurious. Moreover, this was a very large hotel, complete with all sorts of amenities, as many foreigners stayed there. It had several dining rooms, including Chinese and Western restaurants. The Chinese restaurant offered dishes from all over China, prepared in various styles. The Western restaurant offered cuisine from all over the world, each with its own unique flavor. Because of this, people from all over China and the world often stayed at this hotel. Today, the two Miss He's were treating them to Western food, leading them to the Western dining room on the fourth floor. It was a large hall, easily accommodating five or six hundred people. A Western meal wasn't particularly expensive, costing only one dollar and fifty cents, and tipping was unheard of anywhere in China at the time. However, drinks were not usually included, and if one wanted to drink, it would be terribly expensive, due to the heavy taxes on alcohol. Generally, the hotel guests who ate Western food fell into several classes, ranging from one dollar per person to three and a half dollars per person. The standard meal was one dollar per person, and the dishes were quite plentiful. Only foreigners or Chinese entertaining important guests would eat the three-and-a-half-dollar meal. Today, Miss He was treating Jin Danyun to a one-and-a-half-dollar Western meal, which was already quite lavish. After they were seated, Jin Danyun asked, "Are you definitely leaving for Freedom Village tomorrow?" He Shuangyu replied, "We are definitely going tomorrow. We should have gone sooner, but because Father hasn't left yet, there are many things here that we need to help him with. My love has also written several times, asking about us, so we sent her a telegram this morning." Jin Danyun said, "In that case, what kind of transportation will you be taking tomorrow? You can take the train or the car; have you decided?" He Liyu said, "We've already inquired about it. If we take the car, we can go directly to Freedom Village without changing vehicles. If we take the train, we'll first go to Suzhou, and then to Freedom Village. From Suzhou to Freedom Village, there are cars and steamships, which is very convenient. We haven't taken the train here before, so we thought we'd take the opportunity to see the sights, so we'd like to take the train to Suzhou and then decide from there. Perhaps my love will come to Suzhou to meet us; it's hard to say. However, she's very busy, so we told her not to come." Jin Danyun said, "I see! It's a pity that I'm also limited by my duties; otherwise, I would have accompanied you to Freedom Village for a visit. But when will you be coming to Shanghai?" As she spoke, she smiled at Lin Jiancheng. (33)

### List of the Ten Best Films of 1938

— Hua Quansheng

The annual selection of the best films is considered a very important event in the United States. Therefore, as the year draws to a close, various film organizations and film magazines are all eagerly engaged in selecting the so-called "Ten Best Films." However, although the purpose of the selection is the same, the methods of selection vary. Some organizations hold their own meetings to review and select the films, while others solicit the opinions of readers and decide based on that. Here are the results of the annual meeting of the New York National Board of Review, which were published in the Motion Picture Herald magazine on December 30th of last year.

The method of selection used by this board is different from others. It is divided into three categories: (1) selecting ten films with purely English dialogue; (2) selecting six films with dialogue in various foreign languages; and (3) because the films selected in the above two categories may not be entirely produced in the country (the United States), selecting ten purely Hollywood films. Now, let's first look at the results of the first and third categories:

(A) Ten Best Films with Purely English Dialogue:

(1) The Citadel (MGM) — starring Robert Donat and Rosalind Russell. Not yet released.

(2) Snow White (RKO) — entirely cartoon.

(3) The Beachcomber (Paramount) — not yet released.

(4) To the Victor (Gaumont) — not yet released.

(5) College Swing (Paramount).

(6) Edge of the World (produced by Pax Company) — not yet released. (Note)

(7) Lord Jeff (MGM).

(8) The Dawn Patrol (Warner Bros. First National).

(9) South Riding (produced by London Films, distributed by United Artists) — starring Ralph Richardson and Edna Best. Not yet released.

(10) Test Pilot (MGM).

(B) Ten Best Films Produced Entirely in the United States:

(1) Snow White (RKO) — entirely cartoon.

(2) The Citadel (MGM) — not yet released.

(3) You Can't Take It With You (Columbia)

(4) Boys Town (MGM) — starring Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney. Not yet released.

(5) Marie Antoinette (MGM).

(6) Alexander's Ragtime Band (20th Century Fox).

(7) The Adventures of Robin Hood (Warner Bros. First National).

(8) The Hurricane (United Artists).

(9) In Old Chicago (20th Century Fox).

(10) Four Daughters (Warner Bros. First National).

It is quite a rare coincidence that the four blockbuster films from last year that had increased ticket prices—namely, the fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth films—are all on this honor roll.

As for the six best films in the second category, some are French films and some are Russian films (because the so-called "various foreign languages" actually refers to foreign films). Moreover, most of them will not be released in Shanghai, so they will be omitted. However, "Peter the Great," the Soviet blockbuster that caused a sensation when it was released at the Cathay last year, was selected as the fifth of the six best films in the second category in this election. This is worth reporting to the readers.

—Note—The name "Pax Company" has never been heard of; it is likely a small Hollywood company.

### Yu Shuyan, Wang Yaoqing, and Lin Shutian's "Asking the Woodcutter"

### One Night in a Coffee Shop at the Third Public Performance of the Yilin Drama Society

— Bingdu

The Yilin Drama Society held its third public performance on Sunday morning at the Carlton Hotel. There were three one-act plays: "Cakes and Biscuits," "New Year's Eve," and "One Night in a Coffee Shop," and the third play was the most successful.

"One Night in a Coffee Shop" is an early play by Mr. Tian Han, directed by Mr. Hu Xudong. This play may seem a little unrealistic in the current era of "anti-Japanese clichés," but the playwright did not write it for this era. It reflects the tragic situation of young people talking about love and the feudal environment at that time. In particular, the writing of "One Night in a Coffee Shop" was at the beginning of the budding of the drama industry, and the object of the play was indeed limited to a portion, ten times smaller than now, of young men and women. When the new idea of advocating freedom of marriage and breaking the buying and selling system flowed into this ancient society, Mr. Tian Han was very indignant, and he felt sorry for those innocent people who were sacrificed. Therefore, the daughter of a poor scholar, Bai Qiuying, ran away from home in order to pursue her own lifelong happiness and worked as a waitress in a coffee shop, earning a living with her sweat and blood. Moreover, she hoped to save money after becoming independent and go back to school to maintain her love with Qian, the son of a wealthy family. This was precisely Mr. Tian Han's ideal and a new love model that he indicated to young people. On the one hand, he also faithfully exposed Qian, a feudal and selfish waste. When the two were breaking up in the coffee shop, he said:

"Please forgive me, I am a weakling," "My father is a gentry official, how can I marry a coffee shop waitress as my wife, even I..." On the contrary, he humorously transformed himself into Lin Zeqi, first using Bai Qiuying's virginal, sacred, and enthusiastic passion to save such a decadent and sentimental artist, and then, conversely, using the same words of enthusiasm to persuade Bai Qiuying after she was heartbroken: "Life is a desert, and travelers need sweet springs." I was almost excited by his enthusiasm.

The whole play had a very good effect, because of a successful script, the characters were clearly grasped, and the director and actors also made considerable efforts. This play became the most lovely one in the third performance. Although I also understand that the scope of this play is inevitably too narrow in the current situation, I would like to encourage it from the standpoint of art, in the state of a shortage of scripts.

### Silver Screen Train

— Yi

Nearly twenty Shanghai-based directors and editors recently held a joint meeting and decided that if necessary, they would all move to Sichuan. Several people are already preparing to depart.

Lu Ming claims that he will determine the love of his heart at his birthday banquet this year. It is rumored that the insiders are a director, a sound engineer, a film critic, a male star, a musician, and a playwright who already has a wife.

Wu Cun recently wrote a script for Guo Hua Company to raise funds for disaster relief, tentatively named "Tears of Flower Voice," and selected Qiu Xia, Hong Dou, Shu Shi, and Jia Nong, who returned to Shanghai from Kunming, to play the leading roles. Qiu Xia specially went to the beauty salon for surgery for this play, and her appearance is more charming and better than before, which is also a major event in the silver screen in the beginning of 1939.

There are many stars playing the "Ping Cao Mu" play at the "Night Flower Circle" at the end of Yu Guo Road.

Gu Meijun and Gu Lanjun went to the Mei Lan Flower Shop yesterday to rest for a while. Customers gathered for a time and sold more than sixty pots of plum blossoms.

Huang Jiamo wrote "Fairy Yun Chang" for Chen Yunshang, and it has been completed. It is said that he will continue to write "The Three Musketeers" with Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, and Liu Jiqun. This gentleman's jokes are soft, and his future is bright.

Xia Xia, Zhou Qi, and Chen Gexin participated in the Huaijiu Normal School drama and performed at the Ningbo Association.

The latest movie songs of Baidai Company, "Dream of Hua Yixiu," "Spring Breeze Wild Grass," and "Rose Blooms," have been sold, and the results are very good. The director of the recording department of the company is now Fu Xiangxun, who is kind and amiable.

Wang Yin and Yuan Meiyun will co-star in "Spring Colors of the Sui Palace," directed by Zhang Shankun himself, which is also a stimulating news from Xinhua.

Yi Hua Company is working hard to search for new people. A certain big director and South Country new star and a large number of technical personnel are all in secret negotiations.

Mingxing Company is preparing to resume its own production, but it will not be released in Shanghai. It is rumored that Hu Die will be the leading actress in the first film.

Wu Yonggang's new film is his recent stage play "Tears Splashed on Flowers."

### Scheduled List of Female Yue Opera Performances

— Hua

The Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Association and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Hometown Group Fundraising Committee jointly organized a female Yue opera performance to raise donations. This was seen in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the scheduled list of plays is explored as follows.

First Day (13th): Tianxiang, Dalai, and Tongshang three troupes will perform together. The daytime play is the complete "Three Scholars Compete for a Wife," performed by Yuan Xuefen, Zhao Ruihua, Li Yanfang, Ma Zhanghua, Zhu Su'e, Yao Shuijuan, Lu Fukui, Lu Shengkui, Mao Peiqing, Xiao Shuijuan, Shang Fangchen, Yuan Jinxian, Qian Miaohua, Yao Yueming, Qian Hongmao, and Liu Peizhi. The evening play is "Joining the Army and Leaving the Kiln" by Yao Shuijuan's Tianxiang troupe, "Four Pan Jinlian" by Zhao Ruihua's Tongshang troupe, "Sending the Phoenix Crown" by Ma Zhanghua's Dalai troupe, and "Three Teasings of Bai Mudan" by Yao Shuijuan, Yao Yueming, and Yuan Jinxian. The grand finale is "Meng Lijun," performed by Yuan Xuefen, Qian Miaohua, Ma Zhanghua, Fu Quanxiang, Qian Hongmao, Zhao Ruihua, Yao Yueming, Li Yanfang, Sun Miaofeng, Xing Xianglin, Yao Shuijuan, Zhu Su'e, Shang Fangchen, Yuan Jinxian, and Xing Zhuqin.

Second Day (14th): Dachina, Yongle, and Laozha three troupes will perform together. The daytime play is "Tricking Liu Shi" by Shi Yinhua, Jia Lingfeng, Zhang Dangui, Xing Yinhua, Zhi Lanfang, and Yu Mudan; "Picking Cassia" by Wang Mingzhu, Qian Xiuling, and Wang Yinfeng; "Ni Feng Fans Tea" by Xiao Dangui, Xing Guifen, and Wang Xiaofeng; "Questioning the Husband" by Wang Mingzhu, Zhang Xiangqing, and Zhang Dangui; "Opening a Shop and Borrowing a Lamp" by Xiao Dangui, Tu Xinghua, Qian Xiuling, Xiao Baobao, and Sun Zhenlei; and "Sacrificing the Husband" by Shi Yinhua, Zhang Xiangqing, Xiao Fengling, Jin Zhufeng, and Yu Caiqin. The evening play is "Teasing Qiu" by Xiao Dangui, Zhang Xiangqing, Jia Lingfeng, Zhou Baokui, and Wang Xiaofeng; "Wang Liu Sues for Justice" by Tu Xinghua and Xiao Lingfeng; "The Grand Hall Meeting" by Wang Mingzhu and Qian Xiuling; and "Sending the Phoenix Crown" by Shi Yinhua, Yu Hanxiang, Qian Xiuling, and Xiao Baobao.

Looking at the playbill for both days, it is extraordinarily wonderful, and it is a joint performance of all the famous female Yue opera stars in Shanghai. It is said that the plays and the roles played were all determined by drawing lots to show impartiality. The ticket price is five yuan, and it has been promoted by the fundraising committee members, and the results are very good. It is also heard that the association will host a banquet for the six troupes at the Da Jia Li Restaurant tomorrow (8th). Such a grand event is also related to good deeds. It is hoped that all philanthropists will have a heart for their own hunger and drowning, generously donate money, and go to see it. The merits are immeasurable.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden in the Old Capital (98)

— Xu Muyun

Old Tan asks Liu Hongsheng how he will die

Today I saw him come to listen to the opera, and I expected that he was here to "pick hair" (meaning to nitpick and find fault). At that time, someone ran backstage to tell the manager, and soon Liu the Lame arrived. He also knew that Boss Tan was in the front hall, and he thought to himself: This old stick (i.e., old thing) is here today, he must have no good intentions. Therefore, from beginning to end, he sang and acted solemnly. Old Tan listened, sometimes shaking his head, sometimes nodding, even if one or two familiar friends asked him how it was, he did not criticize. Until the end, when Yang Liulang passed away and sang "Impermanence arrives, everything ends, I will go to see my ancestors," Old Tan suddenly slapped the table and said, "I see how you will die!" After saying that, he stood up and left. Later, someone asked him what he meant by this, and he said, "Other plays can sell their voices, but this play is sung when a patient is about to die. I didn't expect that in the last sentence, he still used a high note and pulled his voice. Of course, he won't die. Logically speaking, when singing this sentence to 'everything ends,' it's like a dying person taking a breath, the air inhaled is not as much as the air exhaled, of course, the breath is weak and the voice is subtle. When singing the four words 'go to see my ancestors,' he can only read one word at a time intermittently, and there is no such thing as singing. Furthermore, all the singing and acting of dying in the play are not easy, so 'acting death' is also difficult in the work. Moreover, the circumstances of death are different. For example, 'Nantianmen' is freezing to death, 'Li Ling Tablet' is hitting to death, shooting to death, and dying from poison, all of which are rapid, and it is easier. The last sentence of 'Wupenji,' 'Go to the underworld,' can sometimes be cut off with a 'sweeping head,' and not sung down. 'Burning Mianshan' does not sing, but only acts, and there is also the help of rosin fireworks to express the work, and it does not feel difficult. Only these two plays, 'Nantianmen' and 'Hongyang Cave,' must be sung to death, and this last sentence cannot be deleted, so singing high and fast is completely inappropriate. Liu the Lame only knows how to sell his voice, but he doesn't know that this play is not fundamentally sung well with the high voice of the B tune. When we sing opera, the most important thing is that we must never learn and sing hard for plays that are not suitable. His singing of this 'Hongyang Cave' is a mistake of this unsuitable problem, so I want to ask him how he will die." This passage was later heard by Hongsheng, and he was also very impressed. From then on, he stopped singing this play.
