### Aircraft Deploy Daily to Assist in Battle; Chinese Forces Fiercely Attack Shangang from Conghua; Large Chinese Force in Northern Jiangxi Closes in on Lintang; Japanese Forces Southwest of Fengxin Surrounded

Recapture of Zengcheng of Great Strategic Significance

(Hong Kong) The Chinese Air Force has been flying to the front lines of the East and North Rivers for days, assisting the Chinese Army in its counter-offensive. They frequently engage in aerial combat with Japanese planes, gaining a significant advantage and maintaining the initiative everywhere. In the battle of Taipingchang in Conghua, many Japanese and puppet troops were captured. Chinese guerrillas are active near the suburbs of Haikou, and machine gun fire is frequently heard.

(Chongqing) Military sources say that the Chinese army attacking Zengcheng engaged in fierce fighting for three days, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers, and finally recaptured the county seat on the morning of the 14th. The remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray, and their forces have completely collapsed. According to a certain military strategist, the recapture of Zengcheng is of great strategic significance. This area has a strategically important topography, relying on the Zeng River to the east, supporting the rear of Shilong, pointing west to the southern section of the Canton-Hankow Railway, controlling the throat of Guangzhou, and controlling the Canton-Kowloon Railway to the south, serving as a hub for transportation between Hong Kong and Guangdong. It is the most important stronghold for the Japanese in the East River area. Now that it has returned to the firm control of the Chinese army, and at the same time, Huaxian, a Japanese stronghold in the North River, has also fallen into Chinese hands, providing sufficient support. The Chinese army, relying on this major favorable stronghold, overlooks the overall situation, taking advantage of the commanding position, controlling all the Japanese troops in Guangzhou, Shilong and other places. Especially the Japanese troops trapped in the isolated city of Guangzhou, after this battle, their connection with the Japanese troops on all lines has been completely threatened by the Chinese forces. Therefore, after the disastrous defeat, the Japanese may not be willing to give up and will attempt to counter-attack. However, under the strong defense of the Chinese forces, they will continue to exert their efforts to inflict painful blows. No matter how great Japan's ambitions are, they will never succeed.

Editorial

### US President's Appeal to the European Situation

"Reversing the impending disaster, serving as a cornerstone for peace," what kind of spirit, what kind of power, what kind of hardship, what kind of merit is this? But how can it adequately describe the great harvest expected by US President Roosevelt in the telegram he issued yesterday? Tens of millions of flesh and blood beings, endowed with reason, will be sacrificed under the relentless fire of cannons; tens of millions upon millions of assets and material resources will be reduced to smoke and clouds, will become ashes; moreover, indirectly losing their happiness, losing their livelihood, losing their lives because of this, the number cannot be estimated. Pressured by this reality, the calamity is imminent, and the world's anxiety is not a matter of a day or two. Or perhaps it is not considered so, merely because it has not yet happened; not with reason, not with guarantee, can one say that it will certainly not happen. Just consider: there are those who, taking advantage of opportune moments, support authority, and will cast aside the fundamental principles of civilization cultivated and created by humanity for thousands of years, such as freedom, justice, benevolence, forgiveness, honesty, and righteousness, not only like discarded rags, but also destroy them with all their might; they are jealous of other countries that maintain civilized principles, attempting to blindly coerce them to follow; they use racial concepts to expand their power, while forcibly annexing other ethnic groups; they regard diplomatic negotiations as useless methods, and use force as the only way to solve international problems and achieve their own desires; they make promises lightly, treating them as mere words; they hate treaties, regarding them as shackles; they consider coercion as a legitimate desire, and aggression as a legitimate right; they build up their military, brandishing their power and displaying their might; if one were to say that this does not harm human peace, international order, and that they can ultimately live in peace without going to war, who can believe it? The general trend indicates that war is only a matter of time, and recent events especially show that time cannot be delayed much longer, and war is imminent. The arms race, scrambling in fear of falling behind, is indeed a clear prelude to the outbreak of war; and the concentration of troops, the patrolling of fleets, the doubling of standing armies, the conscription of reserves, the rush to build barriers on the borders, and the declaration of martial law in military zones; all these actions are like drawing back the bow, poised and ready to fire, already facing each other at close range, with the outbreak of conflict only a moment away. Truly, if not for President Roosevelt's telegram appeal, one could not believe that there was still a shred of hope to avoid the great calamity.

President Roosevelt's telegram to German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the contents of which have already been published in yesterday's and today's newspapers, with a heart of compassion for humanity, makes an appeal to cease fighting. As of today, it can be regarded as the gospel in the greatest crisis concerning the largest number of people in history. He discusses the state of aggression, saying that in Europe, three countries have lost their independence, and in Africa, one country has lost its independence. In the Far East, a vast territory of an independent country has been occupied by its neighbor, and according to rumors, certain other independent countries are in danger of being invaded. He discusses the consequences of war, saying that regardless of whether they are victors, defeated countries, or neutral countries, all will suffer pain, and the impact will extend to future generations in all countries of the world. He discusses the right and wrong of war, only praising those who fight to defend their homeland: otherwise, he asserts that there is absolutely no reason, and politicians have no right to drive people to fight. He asks Germany and Italy if they can provide a guarantee of non-aggression, listing thirty countries as targets, hoping for a period from ten to twenty-five years. His comfort to Germany and Italy is to discuss the two issues of limiting armaments and promoting trade in an atmosphere of peace. His conclusion is that the pivot of current fortune and misfortune lies with the authorities of each country; and the responsibility for the war in the future cannot escape historical praise or blame. True insights, ultimate truths, incisive analysis, a magnificent spirit; and his statement that his motivation is not based on selfish thoughts or cowardice, especially shows that America's boundless spirit and material strength not only have the vision to span the Atlantic Ocean, but also fill the entire world.

However, can President Roosevelt, and indeed civilized humanity, obtain the harvest expected from this telegram, and the hope for avoiding the great calamity? As of today, this telegram is truly the greatest gospel, but is its value limited to a historical document, or does it have an objective function? According to a Washington dispatch yesterday, the US government is not very optimistic; and to prevent unforeseen events, it has already taken necessary measures; at the same time, the fleet conducting exercises in the Atlantic is about to sail back to the Pacific. The reporter does not want to infer from this the confidence of the United States in issuing this appeal, but the severity of the European situation can be glimpsed even more. As for Germany and Italy, as the main actors in the severity of the European situation, if they sincerely accept good words and change their plans, they can certainly make the serious European situation take a sharp turn for the better; but as of the time the reporter held the pen, only heard cold-blooded retorts from the German and Italian people, seeming not to pay the slightest attention to President Roosevelt's painstaking efforts. The future is not optimistic, this is one proof. And the German and Italian authorities have not yet made a formal statement. What their intentions are cannot be predicted; saying that their response is the opposite of what was expected and hoped for is not unexpected either.

From any point of view, we all hope that Germany and Italy will pull back from the precipice and make good use of President Roosevelt's appeal, taking it as an easy path to transition from military action to diplomacy. The situation has become so turbulent today that the outbreak of war is only a moment away, which is also the last moment to change and follow the easy path of diplomacy. Without such a plan, war will immediately follow. What is worrying is that, given the way Hitler and Mussolini have historically dealt with international affairs, and their policies of encouraging the people, they probably also have their political reasons. Failing to allow for changes with sharp angles; if they do not change and go their own way, not only will the British-French axis in Europe gradually take shape, but also American public opinion will become more sympathetic to Britain and France due to the ineffectiveness of their president's appeal. Therefore, President Roosevelt's telegram, regardless of the purity of its motives, is beyond doubt, but its possible outcome, on the one hand, has the hope of reversing the European situation and becoming a cornerstone of peace, with the United States truly being the "intermediary" it claims to be; on the other hand, it may also, due to the stubbornness of Germany and Italy, promote the strengthening and expansion of the democratic group, and the rapid transformation of the United States into an insider is an extremely rapid and inevitable trend.

### Market in Huangchuan Gradually Recovering

Huangchuan: At the beginning of the month, the reporter departed from a certain place in northern Hubei, broke through the Japanese warning line, crossed the Peiping-Hankow Railway at a certain place, and arrived in southeastern Hubei. After a seven-day journey, I safely arrived in Huangchuan County today. Huangchuan fell to the Japanese last September and was recaptured by a certain guerrilla detachment of a certain war zone of the Chinese army after seventy days. When the Japanese army retreated, they left behind many corpses and military supplies. After the Chinese army entered the city and reorganized for many days, they finally buried all the corpses, actively restored public order, comforted refugees, reorganized the Baojia system, trained strong men, and eliminated traitors. The results of all major efforts are very good. At present, half of the residents in the city have returned, and the market has recovered to the situation before the war. Today, the reporter toured the streets of the north and south cities. Although there is already a sign of revival on the rubble piles, broken tiles and dilapidated walls are everywhere. In the villages within a few miles of the suburbs, broken walls and ruins, and bullet marks are like beehives. Having experienced this catastrophe, the residents feel even more determined to fight the enemy with hatred, unite to resist foreign aggression, and cooperate closely between the military and the people, occasionally attacking the Japanese army, causing the Japanese army to be unable to attend to all fronts.

### Puppet Sui Jing (Pacification) Committee in Bian (Kaifeng) Attacked; Japan Attaches Great Importance

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The Kaifeng puppet Sui Jing Committee was attacked during the inauguration ceremony on the 9th.

Although the names of the other four have not been confirmed, according to a person who recently arrived in Tianjin from Kaifeng, among the puppet committee members at the time of the incident on the 9th were also the traitors Wang Qi, Song Changyan, and Chen Dongsheng. Others appointed within the puppet Sui Jing Office include the traitors Jiang Yanxing, Cheng Xixian, Gao Sheng, Hong Weiguo, Ding Zhuo, and Zhang Zhibin.

### Puppet Manchukuo Bans Soybean Oil Exports

(Peiping) According to sources from the occupied Chinese territories, "Manchukuo" has banned the export of soybeans and soybean oil to China. The Central Bank of "Manchukuo" has received orders from the "Manchukuo" government not to approve applications for exporting such products. It is said that the reason is to increase the prices of these two commodities in "Manchukuo". Another reason is that soybeans and soybean oil are often transported to Tianjin and then to Shanghai for export abroad. This measure can prevent foreign merchants in Tianjin from profiting from foreign exchange. (Reuters, 16th)

Li Huang will soon depart with the Western Route Group to inspect the Songpan, Lixian, and Maoxian areas. Huang Yanpei will fly to Kunming on the 18th on official business. (16th Dispatch)

### Japan and Germany and Italy Negotiate Military Hardware Exchange Agreement: A Substitute for the Tripartite Military Alliance; Arita's Diplomacy Wavering

(Tokyo) In order to enhance the Anti-Comintern Pact in large quantities, Japan is negotiating an agreement with Germany and Italy to exchange aircraft, military hardware, and manufacturing rights as a substitute for the tripartite military alliance. Although the details of Japan's proposal are kept secret, according to the Associated Press, which learned from Japanese government sources, Japan's expectations are: (1) to obtain Italy's latest aircraft; (2) to obtain German military hardware; (3) to hope that Germany will allow Japan to establish aircraft factories in Germany so that they can manufacture aircraft exclusively for Japan, and at the same time, the Japanese can use this opportunity to learn and establish an independent foundation for Japan's aircraft industry. On the other hand, the conditions that Japan offers to Germany in exchange are its willingness to grant Germany considerable concessions and rights in China. However, there are several points that Germany and Italy find difficult to satisfy: (1) Italy is quite hesitant to supply Japan with its latest aircraft, and even if it does, it must be a cash transaction; (2) Although Germany is willing to allow Japanese to operate some aircraft factories, it is only willing to transfer old-style factories to the Japanese, not new-style factories; (3) Both sides want to obtain foreign exchange and are reluctant to part with goods easily. Therefore, the agreement is difficult to conclude for the time being. Furthermore, Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori and Ambassador to Germany Hiroshi Oshima are trying to strengthen the relations between Germany, Italy, and Japan, but they do not receive the support of the Japanese government. Hiroshi Oshima has a preliminary agreement with Germany on military cooperation and is quite unpopular with Tokyo. If Hiroshi Oshima were not a general, he would have been recalled to Japan long ago. One of the reasons why Japan does not want to establish a military alliance with Germany and Italy is the thorny issue of fishery rights with the Soviet Union. Although this issue was later resolved, Japan's compromising attitude was clearly visible. The reason is that Japan would rather sacrifice fishing rights than go to war with the Soviet Union. At the same time, Japan is also trying to coordinate with Britain and the United States, and therefore does not want to conclude an anti-democratic military alliance with Germany.

### 140,000 Soviet Miners Support Their Leader

Willing to Fight for the Country

(Moscow) The congress of 141,966 male and female workers, engineers, technicians, and staff from 140 mines in the Stakhanov region has sent a letter to Stalin, which has just been published in the local newspapers. In the letter, the workers first express their gratitude to Stalin for the peaceful and happy life they have gained through the victory of the Lenin-Stalin party. They then swear to continue their efforts to further improve labor productivity and to make Stakhanov's work even more successful. Finally, the letter states, "The Donets Basin has been and will always be an indestructible fortress of socialist industry. We will work and fight together with all the Soviet people to make the Soviet Union an even stronger and victorious force in the struggle to thoroughly build communism. The miners of the Donets Basin, upon receiving the orders of the Party and the government, will immediately rise up and stand at the forefront of the soldiers defending the socialist motherland, like a steel wall." (TASS, 15th)

### US Ambassador to China to Return to Post Next Month

(Washington) According to news last night, the US Ambassador to China, Johnson, is scheduled to go to China on September 1 to resume his post. In recent days, there have been rumors that American businessmen in China have expressed opposition to Johnson, but after the announcement of this news, the above-mentioned theories have been refuted. Well-informed sources have denied that Johnson's return to China is related to the movement of the US Navy but admit that Johnson's sudden return to China must be related to the increasing tension between the US and Japan. It is understood that Johnson is currently on vacation in the US at Bainbridge Island. The State Department also said that before returning to China, Johnson will have to go to Washington to discuss everything with Hull. (Associated Press, 15th)

### British Army Prepares for Autumn Maneuvers

250,000 Troops to Participate; Airborne Troop Transport to be Tested

(London) Britain's largest military review is about to be held in the autumn. It is said that War Secretary Hore-Belisha will issue orders that all British troops should gather at Tidworth to participate in the review, so that the exercises can be completely similar to actual warfare. The new mechanized units of the British Army will also begin testing during the next exercises. Both armies will have fighter jets to assist in combat, using smoke screens instead of poison gas, and will use giant aircraft to transport troops from one line to another, allowing troops to use parachutes to practice various landings behind enemy lines. Cooperation from local units alone is expected to involve 250,000 people in the activities. (Associated Press, 15th)

### Roosevelt's Loud Appeal; Democratic Countries Respond Unanimously; British Court Fully Agrees with the Proposal; Key to War and Peace Depends on the Attitudes of Germany and Italy

(Washington) After President Roosevelt sent telegrams to German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the biggest impression here is that the President earnestly hopes that mankind can avoid the scourge of war. The President read the original telegram to reporters today, explaining it paragraph by paragraph. When he read the passage "After war breaks out, all countries in the world, regardless of whether they are victorious, defeated, or neutral, will suffer," he paid particular attention to the words "neutral countries," saying that his reason for sending this telegram was out of concern for the neutral countries. All the nations of the world, including those of totalitarian states, fear war, which can be said to be a common sentiment. When he read the paragraph about convening a conference, he said that the United States could only participate in economic and disarmament conferences, not political conferences. All matters of determining boundaries and other political issues should be left to the directly related countries to discuss among themselves. Speakers interpreted this by saying that the President made this statement to dispel the doubts of isolationists who insist that the United States should not be politically responsible for European countries. Later, the President said that he regarded himself as a "middleman," not a "mediator," and only wanted to serve as a messenger between the related countries. Speakers further explained that the President's words were still intended to silence the isolationists and avoid criticism. Finally, when the President read the names of the independent countries listed in the original telegram, he said that all related countries were included, so that they would all benefit when German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini provided guarantees. The President also said that he had not exchanged views with any government before sending this telegram, only informing the governments of Latin American countries separately afterward. He had originally considered this weeks ago, but because the incidents in Czechoslovakia and Albania occurred one after another, quickly becoming faits accomplis, he waited until now, when the situation had not become tense again, before taking action. As for his motivation, it can be summarized in one sentence: the United States will never miss any opportunity to avoid war. He made up his mind, so he called Secretary of State Hull for a meeting to draft the telegram, and after they were sent separately, he went to bed peacefully. (Havas, 15th)

(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax, on behalf of the British government, warmly welcomed President Roosevelt's actions and issued a statement saying that the British government fully agrees with President Roosevelt's assessment of the international situation. They said, "We believe that President Roosevelt, driven by the impetus of a true statesman, has presented a genuine opportunity to save Europe from the war that all are concerned about. We must now await the replies from Germany and Italy. The British government wishes to express its hope here that the replies from Germany and Italy can open the door for carrying out the steps mentioned by President Roosevelt." (Reuters, 15th)

(Paris) After reading President Roosevelt's telegram, Premier Daladier immediately sent a note to the US Ambassador, Bullitt, asking him to convey it to his government. The contents briefly stated that the French government agrees with President Roosevelt's proposals without reservation. France is committed to all ideas of freedom, human solidarity, and maintaining peace within the independent scope of each country. He has already expressed this idea in his radio address on the 29th of last month, and the statements issued by the British and French authorities on the 13th of this month. In addition, all sectors in France warmly welcome President Roosevelt's telegram, saying that it is a practical contribution by President Roosevelt to world peace. French officials also said that the anti-aggression movement of Britain and France has been supported spiritually by the United States, as can be seen from President Roosevelt's listing of European countries requiring Germany and Italy to respect independence. It is hoped that Germany and Italy can accept with sincerity, as Britain and France have done. (Havas, 15th)

(Washington) Nine Latin American countries have sent telegrams to the US State Department, stating their support for President Roosevelt's telegram to Germany and Italy. (Reuters, 15th)

Argentina: After US President Roosevelt sent telegrams to German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last night, Argentine President Ortiz replied to President Roosevelt with a long telegram, which stated, "The wishes and ideals that Your Excellency has revealed are fully supported by the people of our country. The relationship between our country and its neighboring countries has always been based on maintaining peace and respecting international law. Your Excellency has previously made assertions based on the noble moral principles embraced by the nations of North and South America, which are sincerely supported by the people of our country. Although our two countries can stay out of the European disputes, there are various close relationships between us and the Old World, so our country shares the concerns shown in the telegram. In short, Your Excellency's noble desire to promote peace is fully agreed upon by the people of our country, which is what I wish to represent in reply." (Havas, 15th)

Canada: People here praise President Roosevelt's appeal to the dictators as a bold and candid act. (Reuters, 15th)

Moscow: The American President's telegram to Germany and Italy has been uniformly reprinted and endorsed by the local newspapers. Political figures also said that President Roosevelt's benevolent words may not be heeded by the dictators of Germany and Italy. Even if they submit a reply, it must be insincere. At a time when the world is threatened, President Roosevelt's move can be said to be timely, and the organization of the European anti-aggression group will be accelerated as a result. (Havas, 15th)

Warsaw: People in the local government commented that Germany may not agree with the methods proposed by President Roosevelt, so it is doubtful whether they can be implemented. The newspapers said that if leader Hitler wants to maintain peace, he must agree to hold negotiations. The evening newspaper reported that President Roosevelt's move was mainly for domestic consumption, intending to inform public opinion that he had exhausted all means to avoid war. (Havas, 16th)

Yugoslavia: Officials here unanimously welcome US President Roosevelt's peace appeal to Hitler and Mussolini, considering it a "sensitive and agile intervention in the affairs of the Old World." (Associated Press, 16th)

### British Government and Public Opinion Comment

Opening a Path to Avert War; Britain Cannot Afford to Neglect Defense

(London) Today, all British newspapers published President Roosevelt's historic telegram to Hitler and Mussolini in extra-large type, which shows the importance Britain attaches to President Roosevelt's intervention in European affairs. However, the various hopes aroused last night were weakened by the news from Berlin that German officials were treating President Roosevelt's proposals with indifference. The news that the United States had ordered all ships of the Atlantic Fleet to immediately sail to the Pacific was published in a less prominent position than President Roosevelt's telegram to Hitler and Mussolini. The "Sunday Observer" published an editorial today, stating that this century has twice heard major challenges to freedom, both originating in Central Europe, and both exerting the same influence 3,000 miles away, across the Atlantic Ocean. The "Sunday Times" editorial said that the whole world is now eagerly awaiting the replies from Hitler and Mussolini, but some people say that it is better for the two to not reply at all than to make empty promises that they have absolutely no intention of keeping. The "Sunday Dispatch" stated that President Roosevelt's telegram could be listed as one of the greatest services to his compatriots in history. The "Sunday Express" expressed the opinion that if Hitler and Mussolini reject President Roosevelt's appeal, the United States will likely amend the Neutrality Act to favor the countries under aggression. The "Sunday Observer" also published an article by Gavin, stating that the current situation is almost as serious as the crisis last September. If we can arrange ourselves well in the next few weeks, we may breathe the air of peace for a long period of time, but no one dares to say what will change in the next few weeks. The best way to prevent disaster is to prepare to deal with it and make it clear so that those who dare to commit great wrongs can see it. He also said that we must pay special attention to the danger of the other side suddenly seizing key locations, whether in the East or West, or taking other armed violent actions. It is expected that 250,000 people can participate in the activities only through the cooperation of local troops. (Reuters, 16th)

(London) Lloyd George, a senior figure in British politics, called President Roosevelt's telegram to the dictators "a solemn and significant appeal in reason." Opposition leader Attlee also called it "a valuable initiative." The opinions of the two can represent a glimpse of the national approval in Britain. Newspaper commentators have greatly admired the straightforward remarks in President Roosevelt's telegram, such as "You have repeatedly stated that you and the people of your country do not want war. If this is indeed the case, then there is no need for war," praising it as a concise expression of an undeniable fact. In addition, more attention was paid to a passage in President Roosevelt's telegram, which stated that people hope that their fears can be ended, but unfortunately, it is necessary to recognize various new facts. Three countries in Europe and one in Africa have lost their independence and been destroyed. In the Far East, another independent country has also had a large territory occupied by its neighbors. The news that we believe to be inaccurate insists that there are still plans to continue to carry out aggressive actions against other independent countries. Therefore, the world is now moving towards a dangerous period, unless there is a more reasonable way to be the compass for all things, the situation will inevitably end in disaster. At the time of issuing this statement, it is solemnly declared that the people of the United States are not speaking out of selfishness or cowardice, but with the power of human strength and friendship. International problems can be resolved at the conference table, but in the conference room, like in a courtroom, discussions must be sincere if both parties are to gain real benefits. President Roosevelt also asked, after explaining that the United States was willing to mediate amicably because it was not involved in the immediate dispute, "Are you willing to guarantee that the troops of your country will not attack or invade the territory or dependencies of the following independent countries?" (Reuters, 16th)

### German Attitude is Cold

Hitler Studies the Telegram in Detail and Exchanges Views with Italy

(Berlin) The telegram sent by the US President was immediately forwarded to Munich and presented to Hitler for reading. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and other key members of the German government are currently in Munich. The telegram is being studied. It is understood that Hitler will first contact Mussolini before replying. (Reuters, 15th)

(Berlin) Hitler and Ribbentrop both arrived in Munich this afternoon. It is said that they are currently discussing the US President's telegram. Translators are working hard to translate the full text of the telegram into German, which was only completed in the evening. Officials did not make any criticism of it and would not allow any indication as to whether the full text of the telegram would be published. The "Sunday Morning News" did not carry any news about the US President's telegram, but many Germans have learned of the matter by listening to the British external broadcasts. Whether or not there is a basis for the rumors that Germany will occupy Danzig, there is no reliable news. Currently, the only important figure remaining in Berlin is Propaganda Minister Goebbels. According to Reuters, the US President's telegram has not caused excessive surprise, as officials say that Munich has neither convened meetings nor has special activities. It is not planned to publish a communique regarding the US President's telegram tonight. It is said that Hitler may not return to Berlin before Tuesday. (Reuters, 15th)

(Berlin) According to reliable reports, Hitler has decided to resist President Roosevelt's appeal for guarantees of non-aggression within ten years to respect the territorial integrity of Europe and the Near East. It is said that this decision was issued after consultations between Hitler and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Also, Hitler discussed everything with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini by telephone. It is expected that Germany and Italy will adopt the same attitude towards the US peace plan. National Socialist Party officials reported that Hitler may not formally reject the US President's proposal, but simply ignore it. The Propaganda Department is unwilling to confirm the reports that the leader has rejected the proposal but admits that there is indeed a possibility of German rejection. (Associated Press, 16th)

### Wilson's Fourteen Points: The Germans Still Can't Forget

(Berlin) After U.S. President Roosevelt sent a telegram to Führer Hitler, political figures here generally treated it with indifference and made humorous remarks, saying that the telegram was obviously misdirected. Germany had already gained experience regarding the roundtable discussion method, and only after abandoning this method did it become as strong as it is today. Moreover, the fourteen points previously proposed by the late U.S. President Wilson, what was their actual effect? The German side has not been able to forget it. If a roundtable conference were held at this time, there would be many issues for various countries to discuss, and it would be difficult to find solutions in reality. In addition, certain theoretical issues (referring to Bolshevism) are extremely sharp. Germany is not comfortable sitting at the same table with people whose theories are so different. However, German officials refused to express their opinions before Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini exchanged views, only saying that this matter requires important diplomatic negotiations. (Havas, 15th)

### Unwavering Anti-Communist Stance, Claiming Telegram Was Misdirected

(Berlin) Regarding the content of the telegram from U.S. President Roosevelt, the German News Agency briefly released a summary at 10:20 PM today. Its tone was very short. The semi-official German News Agency refuted it, saying, "It is common for President Roosevelt to regard himself as the late President Wilson. His usual trick is nothing more than to provoke other nations to feel uneasy, and then claim to be a messenger of peace. In short, he wants to advocate for the restoration of human happiness after causing world panic, and promote peace after creating a war mentality. His intention is probably to shift the world's attention from totalitarian countries, so as to cover up the propaganda campaigns full of hatred in democratic countries, and because the encirclement policy promoted by certain countries has already caused repercussions, he wants to dispel them. Based on past experience, we are skeptical of this kind of political action by the U.S. President, and there is no reason to be surprised. As for convening a roundtable conference to try to satisfy the vital needs of a great nation, it will also lead to a tragic situation, because various fundamental issues cannot be discussed purely from a legal point of view. In addition, there is one point that President Roosevelt has overlooked, namely the ideological struggle. There is an international destructive force that wants to plunge nations into bloody turmoil and threaten the world order. If this force is allowed to have a safe haven in a certain country and stabilize its position, in other words, if Bolshevism is allowed to enjoy equal rights in world politics, then an enduring and satisfactory situation will not be established internationally for a single day. The so-called roundtable conference will not be able to create a new order. This telegram from President Roosevelt must be misdirected. The strength and wisdom of the German nation have progressed, and it will never allow the victory that the late U.S. President Wilson once achieved to be seen again in President Roosevelt's proposals today. It can be asserted that Germany will reject it." (Havas, 15th)

### Rome Remains Silent for Now, Mussolini in Secret Talks with Göring

Demands of Impoverished Nations

(Rome) Regarding the telegram sent by U.S. President Roosevelt, officials here refuse to express their opinions until Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler have jointly decided on a stance. The telegram has not been made public either. As of now, only leaders from both the party and government know about it. Party officials also said that any initiative that seeks to consolidate peace is welcomed by Italy, but unless the desires of "impoverished nations" are satisfied, fair peace will not materialize. In short, if various pending international issues are not resolved, and if the legitimate demands of Germany and Italy are not met, then President Roosevelt's proposed general agreement will not be realized. (Havas, 15th)

(Rome) It is believed that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will study President Roosevelt's telegram very closely. Today, the Prime Minister is in close contact with German Aviation Minister General Göring, who is visiting Rome. The Prime Minister met with Göring for twenty minutes after the parliamentary session and went to the palace together for lunch with the King of Italy. Few people in Rome are aware of the U.S. President's telegram. Government officials claim to be unaware of the U.S. President's telegram. (Reuters, 15th)

(Rome) Italian political circles consider President Roosevelt's telegram to be a very generous gesture, but they feel that it may be inappropriate to publish the telegram before the recipients have had time to calmly consider and respond. At the very least, the promise of ten years of peace is indeed touching, but political circles feel that a world conference is unlikely to produce good results until Italy's demands on France have been satisfied. Ordinary Italians undoubtedly have a good impression of the U.S. President's move. (Reuters, 15th)

### Italian Foreign Policy Still Based on the Axis

(Rome) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano stated in a speech to the Fascist Parliament today that Albania had suffered oppression, and only a few people would be surprised by its turn to Italy. Now Albania has automatically shaken off the tyranny of the Middle Ages. King Zog asked the Italian government to send troops to attack Yugoslavia, but the Italian government refused because of the good relations between Italy and Yugoslavia. Such an action would be foolish. When the Italian army landed, only a few disgruntled individuals resisted. Only a few people criticized what was in fact a remarkable military operation. Ciano denied the rumors of bombing Durazzo, Vlora, and other towns. His remarks criticizing the democratic powers were repeatedly interrupted by cheers. Ciano continued, saying that any attempt to undermine the Italian-Albanian union would be met with action by both countries. The Rome-Berlin Axis will continue to function well, and Italian foreign policy is still based on the Axis. The presence of Italian troops in Albania is by no means a threat to Yugoslavia. Ciano agreed with British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks about maintaining the Anglo-Italian Agreement, saying that no facts have emerged to prove that this agreement should be changed. On our part, we believe that the Anglo-Italian Agreement established in April of last year is of great value. (Reuters, 15th)

### Mummy Preserved for Seventy-Eight Years, Curly Hair and Rosy Cheeks as if Alive

Budapest. Here, the mummy of a six-year-old child lies in a glass coffin in a museum. This year marks its eighty-fourth birthday. According to reports, this mummy is the son of Alan, a famous anatomist from the former University of Budapest. After this child died at the age of six, Alan preserved his body using a special method. After seventy-eight years, the corpse still has curly hair and rosy cheeks, as if alive. (Associated Press, 15th)

### Göring's Speech: The Solidarity of the Axis Powers Will Endure

(Rome) General Göring paid a visit to Italian King Vittorio Emanuele, speaking for three quarters of an hour. Göring conveyed congratulations on behalf of Hitler, saying that the resolution of the Albanian issue was exceptionally smooth and cause for celebration. Yesterday afternoon, Göring attended a public banquet for the leaders of the Fascist Party's provinces at the invitation of Fascist Party Secretary-General Starace. In his speech, Göring explained in detail the thoroughness of the German and Italian revolutions and the significance of the Fascist Party and the National Socialist Party fighting together under the leadership of great men. It is said that the friendship between Germany and Italy is not only based on political interests but also has deeply rooted special relations. The basic ideas of the Fascist Party and the National Socialist Party are as mutually attractive as magnets and as harmonious as water and milk. From this perspective, the solidarity of the Axis powers will endure and the prosperity of both countries is just beginning. (Haitong, 16th)

### U.S. to Mass Produce High-Speed Destroyers

(Washington) Assistant Secretary of War Johnson recently told the press that the department has recently obtained blueprints for two new types of destroyers and will begin mass production immediately. It is estimated that their speed can reach 650 kilometers per hour, all of which are monoplanes, each equipped with two machine guns. (Havas, 16th)

### 120 U.S. Warships Ordered Back to the Pacific, No Less Than a Warning to Japan Not to Act Rashly, U.S. Deeply Concerned About the Security of the Philippines

(Washington) Yesterday, U.S. authorities ordered the U.S. fleet to immediately return to the Pacific. This order was issued two hours after President Roosevelt called for peace from the totalitarian countries of Europe. The government took this action due to the tense situation in Europe, believing that it was necessary to concentrate the fleet in the Pacific to prevent sudden incidents in the Pacific. All U.S. fleets, except for the new Atlantic Fleet, five cruisers, six submarines, and one aircraft carrier, received orders to "return to the Pacific's usual operating area." These warships will set sail for the Pacific as soon as they are refueled. According to observers here, the British navy has been fully concentrated in the European waters, so that it can join the battle once war breaks out. The scope of this order includes as many as 120 warships. According to the Navy's calculations, it will take about three days to refuel each ship, and about thirteen or fourteen days to sail from the East Coast to the West Coast (Pacific). About sixteen warships will still remain along the Atlantic coast to participate in the New York World's Fair. At the same time, the special review in Norfolk may still be held as usual, but the scale will not be as large as previously planned. The U.S. fleet sailed through the Panama Canal into the Atlantic to the Caribbean Sea in February for large-scale exercises. President Roosevelt also went with the fleet to observe. (Associated Press, 16th)

(Washington) According to information obtained by the Associated Press today, the United States has now obtained various intelligence reports, all of which indicate that once a drastic change occurs in the international situation, it will involve the Far East situation and threaten the interests of the United States. Therefore, the U.S. fleet has suddenly been concentrated in the Pacific. According to official statements, after the changes in the European situation, Japan will take actions in the East Indies that echo those of Italy, which will not only seriously threaten the United States with material supplies, but also endanger the security of the Philippines. According to naval circles, the main force of the U.S. fleet will temporarily remain in the Pacific coast area. Except for a small number of submarines and a small number of warships based in Hawaii, they will not sail west of Hawaii for the time being. According to observations from diplomatic circles, the U.S. Navy's decision to mobilize occurred at the same time as the warning to Germany and Italy. Its significance is to warn certain countries not to continue their aggression. According to well-informed sources, Japan must be wary of this action by the United States, because Japan's current strength is being used in China, and it will definitely be unable to cope with threats from other countries, especially the American people's determination to use the U.S. Navy to deal with Japan.

### Britain and France Seek Military Cooperation with the Soviet Union to Resist Aggression, Negotiations Make Significant Progress, Scope of Agreement Not Limited to Sky Plan

(London) Well-informed sources here recently announced that after British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds held talks with People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov yesterday, an agreement in principle was reached on the issue of guaranteeing the territorial integrity of Romania. (Havas, 16th)

(Paris) Regarding the organization of a collective security system, officials here recently announced that after Foreign Minister Bonnet held talks with Soviet Ambassador Suritz this afternoon, significant progress has been made on the issue of Soviet participation. Several issues have been effectively resolved, and solutions to the remaining issues can also be found in a short period. It is possible that France and the Soviet Union will reach an agreement by the 17th of this month. It is rumored that the proposed conventions are not limited to the "sky agreement," and a separate agreement will be drafted to stipulate that the Soviet Union should supply military equipment and raw materials when Poland and Romania are invaded. (Havas, 15th)

(London) While most people are focusing their attention on Hitler's response to Roosevelt's peace proposal, Britain and France have moved forward today to seek a three-way military alliance with the Soviet Union. It is said that the immediate goal of the British, French, and Soviet negotiations is to reach an agreement in the air force. Once war breaks out, the air forces of these three anti-aggression countries will come out to resist the totalitarian countries. If this air force agreement is concluded, the combined air force strength of the allied countries will have 6,500 aircraft, which is sufficient to fight against the 1,500 aircraft of the Rome-Berlin Axis air force. However, the main purpose of the recent negotiations is to establish a complete military alliance. If any one country is attacked, the other allies will have related obligations, and the agreement will take effect. Moreover, the purpose of Britain and France is to expand this military alliance to include all the small countries guaranteed by Britain, France, or the Soviet Union. Therefore, this military alliance will also include Poland, Greece, Romania, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, and Turkey. British Ambassador to Moscow Seeds met with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov yesterday. Although today is Sunday, it is expected that they will need to meet again. The contents of the meeting between the two ambassadors have not been officially announced, but it is believed that they are nothing more than cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union. France and the Soviet Union already have an agreement, but it can only be implemented after being debated by the League of Nations Council to resist aggression. Therefore, France still hopes to establish a separate automatic defense treaty with Moscow. Paris believes that with this new plan, if France can help Romania and Poland resist Germany's attack, then the Soviet Union will obviously come out to help. This new plan can also allow various weapons and military supplies to reach Poland and Romania. The war materials of Britain and France can also be transported to these countries through Soviet territory. The Soviet Ambassador to France is said to have been authorized to begin formal negotiations with France or to foreshadow the talks between French and Soviet military personnel in order to achieve the establishment of an automatic military alliance. It is believed that the Soviet Union is willing to establish a mutual assistance agreement that includes all "peace-loving countries." If this agreement can be concluded, the Scandinavian and Baltic regions will also be included, and Germany's route to the Soviet Union can be blocked. (Associated Press, 16th)

### Greece Expresses Gratitude for Britain's Guarantee

Athens. Greek Prime Minister Metaxas has asked the British Minister to Greece to convey the Greek government's gratitude for Britain's guarantee to the British government. (Reuters, 15th)

### President Roosevelt's Peace Appeal Telegram (Continued and Concluded)

(Washington) President Roosevelt telegraphed German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last night (this telegram was forwarded by Secretary of State Hull), requesting guarantees to respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of European countries within ten years. The main points have been recorded in the previous telegram. The main parts of the original telegram are supplemented as follows:

President Roosevelt said, "The conference room is no different from the courtroom. The countries involved must provide guarantees, participate in good faith, and have the belief that justice will be achieved. When entering the conference room, they must first leave their weapons outside the door. Today, if governments can frankly declare their current and future policies, world peace can make great progress. I firmly believe that the United States is not involved in the disputes currently occurring in Europe. I am speaking to you purely out of a sense of responsibility and friendship with other countries. These countries are uneasy about the policies that the German and Italian governments will pursue in the future.

I hereby ask you, "Are you prepared to provide assurances that your country's forces will never be used to attack or invade independent countries, namely Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, the Irish Republic, France, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Arab States, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Iran? This guarantee applies not only to the present but also to the more distant future, so that all countries can use peaceful means to devote themselves to more regular work. I propose that you provide a guarantee that you will not engage in aggression for at least ten years. It would be even better if it were limited to twenty-five years. If your government can provide this guarantee, I will immediately notify the above governments and ask them to provide the same guarantee, and then forward it to you. Only with such mutual guarantees can the world have a chance to breathe." After this is done, I will propose discussing the two main issues of limiting armaments and promoting world trade in a peaceful atmosphere. At that time, the United States will also be happy to participate. "What I propose is that countries exchange views with each other through the most effective and quickest ways. Recently, countries around the world have been vying to expand their armaments, and the financial burden has been increasing, and the disaster of economic bankruptcy is becoming increasingly imminent. If this method can be used to exchange views, the crisis can be gradually overcome without a doubt. Not only that, the U.S. government is prepared to participate in any negotiations aimed at finding the most practical ways to open up international trade, so that all countries can buy and sell goods in the world market on an equal footing, and at the same time purchase the necessary raw materials and finished products to maintain a peaceful life. Regarding this, all governments other than the United States that are directly related can carry out the necessary negotiations when the opportunity arises. In short, the current problem facing mankind is very complicated, as we have admitted, but we can continue to discuss and investigate it calmly in a peaceful atmosphere. On the contrary, if international talks are forced to take place under the threat of war, there is no peace to speak of. I hereby venture to speak frankly, hoping to be appreciated. The situation is so serious that the fate of all mankind in the coming years will depend on the actions of the governments. People of all countries want to avoid the scourge of war, and the authorities of all countries should not pretend to be deaf and blind. It must be known that if there is any deviation in the fate and happiness of all mankind, the responsibility will not be escaped from the criticism of history. It is hoped that the answer that you can propose will give all mankind a ray of light, dispel the fear and allow them to live and work in peace for the next few years, then it will be fortunate." (Havas, 15th)

### Good Impression Among U.S. Congressional Figures, Even Isolationists Praise

(Washington) After President Roosevelt telegraphed German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, it has caused a good impression in Congress. Even members who have always advocated isolationism, such as Democratic Congressman Ludlow, have praised it. Democratic Senator George, who recently asked the President to issue a declaration stating that the United States will never participate in the war, also told a Havas reporter, "Any initiative that is beneficial to business must also be beneficial to peace. The President's telegram yesterday is beneficial to both business and peace." The words of praise from government-affiliated members of Congress are even more inexhaustible. Democratic Senator Thomas, who recently introduced a bill proposing to give the President full power to distinguish between aggressor and aggressed countries, also told a Havas reporter, "The President's action can be seen in his repeated declarations. The telegram sent yesterday is particularly timely." (Havas, 15th)

(Washington) President Roosevelt's appeal to Hitler and Mussolini has greatly shocked diplomatic circles, because this telegram may provoke opposition from Congress. According to reliable sources, the U.S. President and the Cabinet discussed the report of the U.S. intelligence agency, which indicated the possibility of some kind of aggressive action occurring within the next four or five days, and then took this action. Diplomatic circles doubt that the Axis powers can accept this condition without losing face. The U.S. President has now placed the responsibility for war and peace directly on the shoulders of Hitler and Mussolini. Diplomatic circles believe that even if this telegram fails to maintain peace, it can facilitate the President's foreign policy at home when war breaks out. This telegram can prove that the President has done everything possible to save the disaster of war, but the Axis powers still do not heed his call and resort to force. In this way, the American public's opposition to the Axis powers can become stronger. According to supporters of the government, President Roosevelt has placed himself in the position of world leader after sending this telegram and has become an international arbitrator. This is the highest stage that any U.S. President has reached since former President Wilson attended the peace conference. (Reuters, 15th)

### Guarantee of Territorial Integrity, China Not Included in the List, Hu Shih Visits U.S. State Department to Inquire About Reasons

(Washington) Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih visited the State Department today, reportedly to inquire about why China was not included in the list of countries whose integrity the U.S. President wanted to guarantee. The State Department has given a mild reply, but the content has not been released. (Reuters, 15th)

### Britain Defends the Mediterranean: Takes Various Precautions; Air Force Squadron Flies to Athens, Gibraltar Defenses Strengthened

(London) Today, it has become clearer than before that Hitler may reject Roosevelt's peace appeal, so Britain continues to take all defensive precautions. A squadron of British aircraft, approximately twenty to thirty planes, has flown to the Tatoi airfield, located ten miles from Athens. This is another move by Britain to defend its position in the eastern Mediterranean. Furthermore, British forces have buried landmines and set up obstacles on the important transportation routes from Spain to Gibraltar. At the same time, a defensive blockade line is being constructed in the port of Gibraltar. (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

(London) Yesterday, the British War Office announced that the First Battalion of Wales would depart for Gibraltar on or after April 22nd. The British side believes that the British military's activities and measures in the Gibraltar area are routine precautions. However, the British government is indeed paying close attention to military actions in Spain. (Haitong Telegraph dispatch, 16th)

Gibraltar: According to reliable sources, troops stationed near here moved west this morning and are now stationed on the slopes of the Ronda Mountains in southern Spain. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

Rabat, French Morocco, North Africa: A traveler from Spanish Morocco reports that military authorities there are actively constructing defensive fortifications in the area near the French Moroccan border. These fortifications are being supervised by foreign technicians and require substantial funding. Certain areas are prohibited to tourists for photography. Local natives and even military personnel of Spanish nationality have expressed unease, fearing that the area, after three years of civil war, will become a new battlefield. Furthermore, the natives there are dissatisfied with the fact that Italian troops have not withdrawn after the end of the civil war, and also because a large number of German warships are about to sail to and patrol Spanish waters. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Tunis, French North Africa: A traveler from the Italian colony of Libya reports that from the 2nd to the 8th of this month, Italian troops landed at the port of Suesara and moved to the area near the Tunisian border, numbering no less than ten thousand. The majority of them are native soldiers from Somaliland and Abyssinia in East Africa. The Libyan authorities are also conscripting natives in the Fezzan region, ordering them to build defensive fortifications in the border area, but most of the natives have fled into the mountains to avoid labor service. Furthermore, since Italy occupied Albania, the Libyan natives have boycotted stores run by Italians. There have even been frequent instances of native soldiers disobeying orders.

### Romanian Foreign Minister Invited to Visit Berlin: The Significance of This Trip Is Significant

(Rome) Foreign Minister Gafencu, accompanied by Secretary-General Baralifescu, departed at 1:20 PM today for a visit to Germany. He is scheduled to stay in Berlin for two days, and then travel to the four countries of England, France, Belgium and Italy. Wherever he goes, he will hold important talks with the governments of those countries. Political figures here have commented that Foreign Minister Gafencu is visiting Germany after the signing of the German-Romanian trade agreement, likely with the intention of seeking guarantees for Romania's independent sovereignty and territorial integrity. His talks with Führer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will certainly be extraordinarily important. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Bucharest: According to news today, King Carol of Romania and Prince Paul of Yugoslavia will meet tomorrow on a ship in the Black Sea. King Boris of Bulgaria will also participate in the meeting to discuss European international issues. (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 6th)

### Rumors Rampant in the Western Hemisphere: Germany Plans to Annex Danzig; The U.S. Authorities Are Quite Concerned About the European Situation

(Washington) President Roosevelt convened a special meeting of foreign policy advisors this morning. Senator Pittman and other diplomatic experts were summoned to the White House. Secretary of State Hull and Under Secretary of State Welles arrived at the meeting first. As the White House convened this meeting, Washington was disturbed by news published in Berlin newspapers regarding the alleged maltreatment of Germans in Polish Silesia. As a result, rumors that Hitler would attempt to annex Danzig became even more rampant. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

(Washington) A dispatch from Berlin states that Hitler may seize Danzig in the middle of next week, and the fact that President Roosevelt's telegram to the German and Italian authorities did not include Danzig on the list of countries is considered quite significant. U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Kirk in Moscow has been ordered to go to Berlin to fill the vacancy left by Counselor Dillen of the U.S. Embassy in Berlin. It is not yet known whether U.S. Ambassador Wilson to Germany will return to his post before U.S.-German relations improve. Although President Roosevelt's telegram mentioned the annexation of Czechoslovakia, Austria, Albania, and Abyssinia, it does not imply that the United States diplomatically recognizes the conquest of these countries. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### The Rising Tide of Resistance to Japan by Chinese Troops in Shandong

Fierce Battle South of Linqu: Great Bloody Battle at Jiangyu; Over 500 Japanese and Puppet Troops Killed

(Chongqing) Airmail News: A radio message from Shandong on the morning of the 9th reports that Japanese troops in Shandong continue to launch large-scale attacks against Chinese forces. On the morning of the 29th of last month, Japanese and puppet troops from Linqu set out in three routes. One route consisted of over 200 puppet soldiers, invading westward and arriving at [blank] in the evening. Another route consisted of over 200 puppet soldiers, invading southward and arriving at Qingyatou, north of [blank] River. These two forces were for [blank] control on both flanks. Another force consisted of over 400 Japanese infantry, over 100 cavalry, over 200 puppet soldiers, eight artillery pieces, twenty machine guns, and 500 carts, advancing along the Yilin Highway. While crossing the [blank] River, they were ambushed by a certain unit of the Chinese army. At 4:00 PM, they arrived at Xinzai, 30 li north of Jiangyu. On the morning of the 30th, the Chinese army lured the Japanese and puppet troops to Heikewa Xiayu, southwest of Xinzai. After two hours of fierce fighting, over 50 Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed. At 10:00 AM, the Japanese and puppet troops arrived at Zhaolingzi, north of Jiangyu, and engaged in a fierce battle with a platoon of the Chinese army's advance troops. Subsequently, the Chinese army utilized the terrain for concealment, and the Japanese and puppet troops fired dozens of artillery shells, but the Chinese army did not move. When the Japanese and puppet troops approached, the Chinese army opened fire with machine guns, killing over 50 enemy soldiers. The Japanese and puppet troops retreated in disarray to Changzhuang for reorganization, and then launched a concentrated artillery counterattack against the Chinese army and encircled them from both flanks. [Blank] defended steadfastly without retreating and killed dozens more enemy soldiers. The platoon also made a heroic sacrifice of 25 men. On the 31st, the Japanese and puppet troops gathered at Jiangyu, planning to invade southward the next morning. Jiangyu is divided into Dongyu and Xiyu, both of which have surrounding walls. At that time, there were about 600 Japanese and puppet soldiers in Dongyu and about 200 in Xiyu. The Chinese army attacked both villages simultaneously at dawn on the 1st of this month. At 5:00 AM, both villages were simultaneously breached by the Chinese army. A certain battalion commander of the Chinese army bared his chest and directed the attack, charging back and forth in Dongyu three times. One soldier single-handedly killed seven Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, over 40 Japanese and puppet soldiers were discovered in a courtyard. Two squads of Chinese soldiers threw hand grenades, killing all the Japanese and puppet soldiers in the courtyard. Later, Japanese and puppet troops from other locations rushed to assist, and the two squads of Chinese soldiers also made a complete sacrifice. In addition, a certain squad of the Chinese army killed over 30 Japanese and puppet soldiers outside the east gate and were later surrounded and sacrificed by the Japanese and puppet troops. Platoon Leader Ma Wenyuan of the Chinese army wielded his saber and killed the enemy, continuously hacking down nine Japanese and puppet soldiers. Ma also sustained seven wounds. Furthermore, Company Commander Wang Haichao of a certain company, after his entire company was sacrificed, still held a machine gun and killed many Japanese and puppet soldiers, eventually making a heroic sacrifice as well.

The battle situation in Xiyu was just as fierce as in Dongyu. After his entire company was sacrificed, Company Deputy Commander Yang Dengfu of the Chinese army, with several hundred guards, continuously hacked down several Japanese machine gunners. He was seriously wounded but still killed many before sacrificing himself for the country. In addition, Geng Jiqing, the machine gun company commander, led a squad to provide cover on a high ground southwest of Xiyu. When Japanese and puppet troops detoured from the Shahe River, over 40 of them were killed. The squad continued to advance to outside the west gate, but the machine gun malfunctioned, leading to the squad being surrounded by Japanese and puppet troops, and the entire squad was sacrificed. The company commander carried his gun to a ditch to repair it and was discovered and killed by Japanese troops. In this battle, the Chinese army fought fiercely with the Japanese and puppet troops for six hours, from morning until noon. The Chinese army killed over 500 Japanese and puppet soldiers, heroically sacrificing 18 company and platoon leaders and over 300 soldiers. This action thoroughly shattered the Japanese army's plan to mop up southern Shandong. Local people welcomed them with food and drink and would weep with emotion when speaking of the heroism of the Chinese army's resistance. (10th)

### Jinan Assassination Squad: Assassination of Two Important Traitors; Puppet Court President and Puppet Department Head Assassinated on the Same Day

(Chongqing) Airmail News: A radio message from a certain location in Shandong on the 9th reports that on February 10th, the Chinese army's assassination squad assassinated Hao Shuxuan, the puppet education department head, and Zhang Chaoji, the puppet high court president, in Jinan, causing traitors to be terrified and shocked. The details of the event are as follows:

At 8:00 AM on February 10th, a person in charge of the assassination squad, accompanied by two squad members, each riding a bicycle under the guise of delivering gifts, arrived at the private residence of Zhang Chaoji, the puppet high court president, on Zhijinshi Street in Jinan. One person first had a guard at the front of the door monitor with his gun, and the two others, carrying gifts, passed through two courtyards and went straight to Zhang's bedroom. They woke Zhang from his sleep and immediately informed him that they had come to eliminate a traitor. As Zhang was panic-stricken, someone stabbed Zhang in the heart with a sharp knife, and Zhang fell to the ground and died. Someone then closed the room door, returned to the gatehouse, and called his companion to ride away, behaving with extreme composure. At the same time, another person in charge, accompanied by two squad members, rode bicycles to the private residence of Hao Shuxuan on Houponan Street in Dongguan, falsely claiming to be delivering gifts. Hao's guard said, "The department head is about to go to the office to work, no need to deliver gifts." As he spoke, Hao came out. Someone pretended that Hao had been a teacher at Jinan Zhengyi Middle School and told Hao that they were students from Zhengyi Middle School and had come to deliver gifts. Hao invited them to sit in the living room. As they sat down, one person talked with Hao, while the other pierced Hao's back with a sharp blade. Fresh blood gushed out, splattering someone's clothes. Unfortunately, the location was slightly off, not causing death. Hao yelled and ran. Someone, in a hurry, fired a shot, hitting Hao in the waist. He fell to the ground. At that time, the other person had already fled. Hao's guards, hearing the sound, rushed over and fired at someone, hitting his hand. Someone retaliated while trying to escape out the door. Under the east wall, he encountered over ten puppet security corps soldiers and Japanese soldiers. Someone then turned west towards the Huamei Hospital alleyway, where he encountered dozens of puppet police. Someone, realizing that there was no way out, loudly said, "Are you all Chinese? If you are Chinese, you should not block my way. If anyone blocks me, he is a traitor, and I will kill him first." While speaking, he pointed his gun at them. The police, stirred by righteousness, quickly retreated into the alley. Someone then rushed through Xin Dongmen and into the city. Inside the city, he encountered puppet police four or five times, but he lectured them on righteousness and safely passed through. When he reached a secluded street, he quickly took a rickshaw and fled. After this incident occurred, the Japanese army conducted a large-scale search, arresting and killing many patriotic youths. To this day, Jinan is under very strict security.

### Achievements of the Military Discipline Inspection Team in Zhejiang

Jinhua Correspondence: The First Military Discipline Inspection Team, after arriving in Zhejiang for four months, has offered much criticism on various military and political matters in this province. The team left Jinhua for Jiangxi on the 5th of this month and issued the following statement before leaving. In addition to rectifying military discipline, the Military Discipline Inspection Team has also reported cases of corruption by civil and military officials. This time, the inspection of 41 counties in Zhejiang and the inspection of troops took up most of their energy. As a result, the work of reporting corruption could not be done thoroughly. However, anything they saw or heard would not be easily let go. For example, the cases of Wei Sicheng, the former director of the Highway Bureau and deputy director of the Transportation Office, Li Lusheng, the former deputy director of the Highway Bureau, and Qiu Yuanxiong, the former magistrate of Pinghu County, have been reported according to the law. The chairman of the committee replied on March 6th, stating that he had ordered Chairman Huang to detain Wei Sicheng, Li Lusheng, and Qiu Yuanxiong and hand them over to the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command for strict handling. In addition, the case of Zhong Shijie, the magistrate of Fenghua County, who took bribes and condoned false accusations, has been transferred to the Provincial Security Command for submission to the provincial government for suspension of his duties for legal handling. In addition, the case of Chen Xian, the police chief of Dinghai, for extortion and bribery, has been referred to the provincial government for detention and legal handling. In addition, a total of 837 cases of corruption, illegality, and dereliction of duty reported by the people have been handled by the relevant authorities. The team still has an office at its original address, with committee member Liang Shangdong in charge. All cases reported by the people will continue to be received.

### Implementation of Policies in Fujian Province Over the Past Year: Focusing on the Two Goals of Concentrating Human Resources and Material Resources

Fuzhou Correspondence: Xu Xueyu, an advisor to the provincial government, recently gave a talk on the political facilities established in Fujian Province over the past year. A summary of his talk is as follows:

The political facilities established in Fujian Province over the past year have been implemented with the two major goals of concentrating human resources and concentrating material resources. Regarding the concentration of human resources, it is to train the people and organize the people. The educational institutions are responsible for training the people, and the civil affairs institutions are responsible for organizing the people. The guides for training and organizing the people are (1) civil servants, (2) young students, and (3) baojia personnel. In other words, these three types of people are the cadres who train and organize the people. First, the cadres must be trained and organized well before we can talk about the issue of training and organizing the people. The process of training cadres is described in detail below:

(1) Training of Civil Servants: The training of civil servants began in the autumn of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] and intensified after the start of the War of Resistance. It can be divided into five categories: (1) Training of County and District Administrative Personnel: A County Administrative Personnel Training Institute has been established to be specifically responsible for training. Those trained are the section chiefs, staff members, school supervisors, directors of tax collection offices, tax collectors of county governments, and the district chiefs and staff members below the county governments. (2) Training of Construction Personnel: All types of technical personnel, such as agricultural and forestry personnel, civil engineering personnel, and weights and measures inspectors, are trained in classes set up in county training institutes. Also, because the highway development in this province has been rapid, a special Vehicle Affairs Personnel Training Institute has been established to train vehicle affairs personnel. (3) Training of Land Administration Personnel: The Land Administration Bureau has established a Land Administration Personnel Training Institute to train land administration personnel in preparation for organizing land throughout the province. (4) Training of Health Personnel: Higher-level midwifery schools and medical schools (recently upgraded to medical colleges) have been established to train doctors and midwives to improve the health of the people. (5) Training of Police Personnel: A Security Department Training Institute has been established to train officers of the security teams in various counties, and a Police Officer Training Institute has been established to train police officers of all levels to be responsible for maintaining order. In addition, there are also statistics classes to train talent to handle statistics in county governments, banking training classes to train staff for the Fujian Provincial Bank, and military law trial personnel training classes to train military law trial personnel in county governments. There are about 10,000 people being trained in the above categories, and they are assigned by the government to different positions.

(2) Training of Young Students: There have been two rounds of training for young students so far. The first group of students concentrated on training the people, in short, civil training. The second group of students concentrated on educating the people, in short, civil education. The first student civil training work was from January to May of the 27th year of the Republic [1938]. A total of 1,844 students were mobilized, and a General Team for Cadre Training of the People was formed. There were 1,609 male students, formed into ten companies, and 235 female students, formed into two companies. These were all high school or normal school students in their second year or above, simplified normal school students in their fourth year or above, and college students of all grades. They were concentrated in Fuzhou and received three weeks of cadre training, divided into military and political training groups. The second student civil education work followed the student training of the people. It was planned to establish 10,000 wartime people's schools throughout the province, to be completed within two years. In the 27th year of the Republic [1938], 1,000 independent wartime people's schools were first set up, and 4,000 wartime people's schools were also attached to various primary schools, starting classes at the same time as the various primary schools. These people's schools mainly held adult classes for women, but children's classes could be added.

(3) Training of Baojia Personnel: The baojia system is the grassroots organization of townships and towns, and is also the lowest-level organization closest to the people. If this organization is not sound, no good political work can be promoted. To make the baojia system sound, sound members are needed. Therefore, in addition to (1) convening baojia chiefs and giving them training to enhance their intelligence, (2) generally holding short-term training, with bao chiefs trained by the county and jia chiefs trained by the district, with a portion of them drawn and trained in batches every six months, and (3) carefully selecting the candidates for baojia chiefs and rewarding the virtuous in the countryside to take office as baojia chiefs, and (4) appropriately increasing the funds for the baojia system, there is also a large-scale "Bao Training Integrated Cadre Training Institute" to transfer the joint bao directors of the entire province to the institute in stages for concentrated training, and after graduation, they will return to their original positions. (To be continued)

### Xinghua Bans Rice Exports to Regulate Food Supply and Prevent Aiding the Enemy

Xinghua Correspondence: Rice is the main product of Xingyi. In years of abundance, the people have enough food to be self-sufficient. Last year, the dam water caused a disaster, and the autumn harvest suffered a major loss. Refugees gathered, and the consumption increased again, leading to a decrease in the amount of rice in storage. Various merchants promised to transport it to Xinghua from outside, so as to make up for the deficiency, but some unscrupulous merchants, without considering the times and only seeking profit, not only took the opportunity to manipulate and raise prices, but also exported rice in large quantities to other counties, selling it and reselling it to aid the enemy, which is extremely abominable. In view of this, the county government, in order to regulate the food supply, both at the root and at the branches, specially organized a Rice Price Evaluation Committee to evaluate and set prices, so as to prevent arbitrary price increases. At the same time, it strictly prohibits the export of rice to curb the outflow, accumulate reserves, and issue public notices so that, if there is any deliberate violation, they will be severely punished.

### Overview of the Ministry of Education's Management of Chinese Film Education in Recent Years (1) – Remarkable Achievements in the Past Two Years, Actively Implementing the Six-Year Plan

(Chongqing Correspondence) Pan Chenghou, Secretary of the Film Education Committee of the Ministry of Education, recently compiled a report on the management of film education in recent years and submitted it to the Ministry of Education for record. The original report is very long. The following is an excerpt of the part concerning electrical education facilities:

In recent years, China's social education has become increasingly developed, and the promotion of electrical education has gradually become popular, from Mongolia in the north to Xinjiang in the west, and Yunnan and Guizhou in the south. This endeavor began with the establishment of the China Educational Film Association in 1932. In the autumn of 1936, the Ministry of Education established the Film Education Committee to take charge of advocacy and gradually carry it out. The Ministry of Education also formulated the "Six-Year Plan for Film Education," stipulating that within six years from 1936, it would complete the goal of establishing a film education mobile teaching area in every county and city in the country. It planned to establish 80 areas in 1936, 160 areas in 1937, 400 areas in 1938, 450 areas in each of the years 1939 and 1940, and 460 areas in 1941. According to this plan, 81 film education mobile teaching areas were established in various provinces and cities in 1936, with five areas each in Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong provinces; four areas each in Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Shandong, Hebei, Fujian, and Guangxi provinces; two areas each in Anhui, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan provinces; two areas each in Ningxia, Guizhou, and Chahar provinces; and one area each in Gansu, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Qinghai (Hai), Beijing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Weihai provinces, cities, and districts.

In 1936, the Ministry of Education provided full-fee subsidies to various provinces and cities for the purchase of machinery and equipment, including 18 projectors for Gansu, Sichuan, Guizhou, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Weihai provinces and districts (four in Yunnan, three in Suiyuan, one each in Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Weihai, and two each in the rest) and 19 generators (one in Weihai, and the rest with the same number as projectors). The total subsidy amounted to 15,992 yuan (over 3,000 yuan for Yunnan, over 2,000 yuan for Suiyuan, over 1,500 yuan each for Gansu, Guizhou, Chahar, Ningxia, and Xinjiang, over 900 yuan each for Gansu and Qinghai, and over 600 yuan for Weihai).

In addition, half-fee subsidies were provided to 20 provinces and cities including Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Beijing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao for the purchase of machinery and equipment, totaling 62 projectors and 61 generators (five each in Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong provinces, varying numbers of three or four in other provinces, and one each in the cities). The total subsidy amounted to 28,178 yuan (Jiangsu received the most at 3,000 yuan, followed by Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Guangdong at over 2,000 yuan, mostly over 1,000 yuan, and 450 yuan for each city). The total amount of full-fee and half-fee subsidies was 44,170 yuan and 94 cents.

### Notes on the Exhibition of Chinese Historical Books (3)

— Shi Chongpeng

18. Yuan Dynasty Wang Meng's "Winter Green Thatched Cottage Picture" - Ink and color on paper, a three-foot vertical scroll. The red maple and winter green trees in the picture form an interesting contrast. Dry strokes are used and light ink is added for rendering, creating a natural and profound effect. An old man sits precariously in the thatched cottage, looking extremely leisurely. A waterfall can be seen among the trees. The mountain recluse inscribed: "My wild and awkward nature only loves quiet, climbing to a thatched cottage among the chaotic mountains. Winter green trees are planted in front of the door, and their branches are red with berries in the twelfth lunar month." The inscription also states: "Written by Wang Meng, the man of Yellow Crane Mountain, in the second month of the Xinmao year." There is also an inscription by Shen Xuan: "The hermit lives in the green shade, and the cherries are also red in the grain rain season. He drinks spring wine by the west window every day, and what is the need of praying to the chicken old man to keep him alive?" In addition, there are inscriptions and collection seals by Gao Huan.

19. Yuan Dynasty Wang Meng's "Secluded Residence in the Forest Foothills Picture" - Ink and color on paper, a six-foot hall painting of figures, landscapes, and several large pine and cypress trees. An old man sits in a spacious thatched hall, playing the qin. There are two bookboys with clear and refined features, devoid of worldly air. The mountain peaks are steep, with thick and lush strokes. Moreover, mountain recluses rarely include figures in their landscapes, making this painting especially elaborate and rare.

20. Yuan Dynasty Ni Zan's "Green Water Garden Picture" - Ink on paper, a three-foot vertical scroll depicting ancient trees, bamboo, and rocks, with elegant and unrestrained brushwork, loose and broad. Yunlin inscribed: "Beside the stone is a green branch, the ink is dripping after the rain on the goose pond. Who knows that the guest in the Green Water Garden recites poetry alone in the empty court at sunset?" "Written for the owner of Green Water Garden and inscribed, Zan, June 5th." Cao Shu inscribed: "I imagine the high-minded person has disappeared, and I only read the clear ink in the calligraphy. Where I used to walk and chant with a staff, the bamboo and trees are delicate beside the waves of ink." I once saw Yunlin's "Picture of Rongxue Zhai," which did not include the Zhai, but only a leather pavilion. Now I see this picture inscribed as "Green Water Garden Picture," but the picture is not a garden scene, which proves that both are undoubtedly genuine works of Yunlin. Zhu Sheng inscribed: "The stone pillar for weaving remains, the ink boat is far away, the phoenix perch is cold in the tin valley. I seem to wander in the clear secret pavilion, and I endure the white hair to write poetry on the wall." "Also inscribed, lighting incense and closing the thatched hall to play with ink, high sentiments are often forgotten by the world. Now that the relics are rarely obtained, I deeply treasure and should store them carefully."

21. Yuan Dynasty Fang Congyi's "Secluded Interest by the Stream Bridge Picture" - Ink on paper, a two-foot vertical scroll with broken clouds and mountain peaks, and smoke locking the treetops. The height of the artistic conception is unmatched by other artists. There are inscriptions by Wen Zhengming in the picture. Zhong Zheng inscribed: "New waves ripple the wind reeds, half of the clouds and mountains are visible after the rain. This is the most secluded place by the stream bridge, who calls Fang Congyi from the book?" A realistic record. Shi Tian inscribed: "Kuh Xian has already completed the path of ascension, chickens and dogs follow him to heaven. Playing with the remaining paper and ink, he will live for a thousand years in the world." My teacher, Mr. Xiao Wuquan, loves Fang Congyi's landscapes the most. Recently, he gave me a small landscape with secluded and unrestrained brushwork, which coincides with this painting by Fang Congyi and is even more precious.

22. Yuan Dynasty Bu Dan's "Heavenly Victory Landscape Picture" - Blue and green on silk, a two-foot hall painting with clouds embracing peaks and mountains surrounding stream banks. It is indeed a scenic spot by the lake and sky. Tianxi inscribed: "Painted by Tianxi of Quancheng in the ninth month of the Yichou year of the Yuan Dynasty." And wrote in the postscript: "Going north out of the Wujia Valley, the dense trees are heavily layered, and the people live densely. Looking back at the valley, the secluded residence with water and stones is a different scenic spot by the lake and sky." Tianxi followed Mi Gao, and this painting's clouds, peaks, smoke, and trees deeply penetrate the essence of both schools. (The End)

### The Problem of Balancing Prices

— Bao Leti

(1) How Should This Problem Be Viewed?

Although everyone feels that prices are terribly high now, everyone thinks this is a normal phenomenon during wartime. This is indeed the case, and it is the same both domestically and abroad. Everyone grits their teeth and endures this war-time phenomenon, which reflects the entire nation's spirit of enduring hardship and sacrifice; it is worthy of pride to the world.

However, we must not simply accept it as inevitable and let it go. Because there are many people who are taking advantage of this reason to manipulate prices and deliberately raise them. For the overall interests of the country and the nation, everyone should firmly maintain the spirit of sacrificing everything, but in fact, we cannot deny that there is a limit to enduring hardships in material life. At the same time, it should be considered that if the people's livelihood is oppressed by high prices to the point of being unsustainable, it will not help the war effort.

Moreover, instead of saying, "It is currently necessary to find a practical solution," it is better to say, "For the sake of future security, it is now necessary to plan ahead and nip problems in the bud!" Because the main reason for the current soaring prices is known to be related to the war. Then, in the future, when there is no hope of ending the war, and when all the reasons that stimulate rising prices continue to exist, there will inevitably be a risk of unlimited escalation; there is no doubt about that.

(2) Analysis of the Reasons for Rising Prices

Why does the existence of war sufficiently stimulate soaring prices? The reason is very simple. Let's take the current situation as an example:

(1) Before the war, the national expenditure was at most around 800 or 900 million yuan; even the total budget for the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), which set a record high, was only slightly more than 1 billion yuan. But since the outbreak of the war, due to the rapid increase in military expenditure, it is said to have exceeded 2.5 billion yuan. This means that the demand for goods has almost doubled compared to normal times. With increased demand, prices will naturally also increase. In Shanghai, the sudden increase in population has also greatly increased demand, but this is not a major factor, because:

(2) If production can increase at the same rate as the increase in demand, then the rise in prices can still proceed along a curve, without rising higher and higher. However, our production industries were already so backward in peacetime, and during the war, they have been damaged beyond recognition. Not only are industrial facilities dilapidated, but a large number of farmers have also stopped farming in the war zones. In addition, the Japanese army's looting everywhere has further increased the consumption of materials and widened the gap between supply and demand.

(3) With the sharp decline in domestic production, coupled with the Japanese side's looting, our country's export capacity has been greatly reduced. Reduced exports affect the balance of international payments. Moreover, our country's military supplies and even civilian supplies are mostly dependent on overseas sources. As a result, the value of the currency itself is threatened. Moreover, the Japanese side is doing its best to disrupt our country's foreign exchange. Since the emergence of the foreign exchange black market, the value of the currency has fallen by about 40 percent. With the fall in the value of the currency, the prices of imported goods are bound to rise even more sharply. Therefore, the monetary burden for the government and the people to purchase foreign goods is even greater. The amount of currency circulating domestically will naturally have to be increased.

(4) When the amount of currency in circulation increases, if the flow of goods is smooth, then the degree to which currency stimulates prices can be reduced by the increase in the transaction rate. However, the transportation lines in the war zones are all controlled by the Japanese side, and even if freight transport relies on foreign merchants, it cannot cope adequately. Therefore, the situation of imbalance between supply and demand is even more serious, and the force of price increases is even stronger.

(5) In the process of commodity circulation, in addition to the difficulty of freight transport, there are many other obstacles. The Japanese puppets extort goods along the way in the war zones, and now they are further promoting their so-called "trade control." In addition, increases in freight rates, insurance rates, and domestic exchange rates are all intensifying the degree of imbalance between supply and demand and the momentum of rising prices.

These many pressures that stimulate prices are all products of the war. As long as the war exists, the possibility of rising prices will also exist. The pain of these high prices caused by the war can certainly be offset by the gains of the final victory. However, in addition to these natural reasons, there are also phenomena such as speculation, manipulation, monopoly, and hoarding: and these phenomena have a more fierce impact on prices. It is indeed impossible to calculate the position occupied by speculative prices in the prices of various goods. But can you just give an example to prove what level it occupies in the current price level?

(3) Speculative Prices in the Price Level

For example, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, the number of rice stored in warehouses in Shanghai did not actually decrease. In terms of the rice market season, this is the weakest period for rice prices throughout the year, but this time, contrary to the usual practice, prices suddenly began to rise sharply. The reason for the soaring prices: it is said that it was because the Japanese army was buying up rice, so Shanghai was in danger of a rice shortage. Everyone competed to hoard rice. It is understandable to hoard rice to prevent shortages. But what is suspicious is why did the rice price stop rising at the limit of 14 yuan? If there is really a danger of a rice shortage, even under strong control, a black market will occur, just like the black market that occurred during the rice shortage last spring. Moreover, when the rice price rose to 14 yuan, why did the Japanese army stop buying? If it is said that buying at a high price would be a loss, the Japanese army does not pay the market price for anything it buys. Is it expensive? Is it not expensive? It is not related to whether they buy it or not. Later, it was heard that this rice price surge could be seen as the "unfair cry" of Shanghai rice merchants. Because now, except for the price of rice, which is still the same as before the war, everything else has risen sharply.

Now, one of the factors in high prices is the foreign exchange relationship. The price of rice is not affected by this, because it is a local product. But cotton is also a local product, so why can't it be as stable as the price of rice? If it is said because of the need, then the need for cotton is not necessarily greater than the need for rice? If it is said because of the Japanese puppet regime's control and harsh taxation, rice has also never been treated differently? However, the current market price of cotton has risen by more than 50% compared to the average price in the six months before the war. The rise in cotton prices, in addition to factual reasons such as supply and demand, is largely due to the soaring yarn prices. Looking at January to October of last year, yarn prices were constantly rising, while cotton prices fluctuated. Therefore, the average yarn price for the whole year last year rose by 32.3% compared to January to August of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), while the cotton price fell by 2.1%. In January of this year, the yarn price rose by 52.9% compared to the average of the eight months before the war, and the cotton price also rose to 44%. (See the Sixth Shanghai Table in the January issue of the Economic Statistics Monthly)

Why did yarn prices rise so sharply? Of course, it is related to many of the reasons mentioned above, but speculative factors are even more related. Although from the decline in production, many figures on the destruction of production facilities can be presented to prove it, Shanghai is, after all, the producing area of cotton yarn, and the supply is always easier than in other places. There is no reason in circulation to cause yarn prices to rise sharply. Moreover, it is a domestic product, and there is no currency impact. Shanghai yarn prices have always dominated national yarn prices. If its price is indeed reasonable, then it should not take advantage of the needs of the interior to arbitrarily set high prices for sale. But now, because the price of yarn in the interior is surprisingly high, the price of yarn in Shanghai is also raised as much as possible, so it has become more and more expensive today. It should be known that taking advantage of needs to set high prices for sale is precisely one of the tricks of speculative manipulation.

We may as well compare it from the perspective of regions. The rise in prices in Shanghai is actually more severe than in the interior. Due to material limitations, let's compare July of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) and August of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938):

Comparison of Price Indices between Shanghai and the Interior (Using the Average Price for the Whole Year of 1937 as the Base Period)

| Location  | July, 26th Year of ROC (1937) | August, 27th Year of ROC (1938) | Increase Rate |
| --------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Shanghai  | 97.4                       | 127.6                       | 30.2        |
| (Guangzhou) | 96.3                       | 122.2                       | 25.9        |
| (Chongqing) | 104.2                      | 113.1                      | 8.9         |

(Note) Shanghai and Guangzhou originally used 1926 as the base period. The calculation was changed to use the average price for the whole year of 1937 as the base period, so as to compare it with the Chongqing index, which used July of 1937 as the base period, as above. For materials, refer to the China and Foreign Economic Yearbook published by the China National Economic Research Institute.

Shanghai had already experienced war in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), while Guangdong and Sichuan were in the rear at that time. Taking the average price for the whole year as the base, and comparing it with the prices afterwards, Shanghai should theoretically have a lower increase rate than the interior, but the opposite is true. Like the price in Shanghai in August of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), which had changed from the front line to the rear, it rose more sharply than in the interior. The reason that the high prices in the interior influenced the prices in Shanghai is obviously untenable, and it instead proves that the degree of speculation in Shanghai is far more serious than in other places.

(4) High Prices and Wartime Economy

Generally speaking, prices and the purchasing power of the people are mutually causal. When prices rise, the income of the people increases, and therefore the purchasing power of the people also increases accordingly. If prices rise above the level of the people's purchasing power, the people's consumption will naturally shrink; therefore, prices will inevitably fall until they are equal to the people's purchasing power. But this is conditional on developed production and stable order, and in fact, it cannot be fully realized. Because wages will never rise in the same proportion as prices, high prices only weaken the purchasing power of the people, and there is very little possibility of increasing the purchasing power of the people. Look at the table below: The average wage of factory workers in Shanghai only increased by 1.8% in the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) compared to the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), but the cost of living for workers at this time has increased by 29.4%. This is an obvious fact:

Comparison Table of Cost of Living and Wage Index for Shanghai Workers

| Year            | 26th Year of ROC (1937) | 27th Year of ROC (1938) |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Cost of Living Index for Workers (1) | 124.11                 | 160.60                 |
| Wage Index for Factory Workers (2)     | 100.00                 | 101.80                 |
| Purchasing Power of Currency (3)      | 80.57                  | 62.27                  |

(Note) (1) According to the figures compiled by the China Branch of the International Labour Office; (2) The wage index is calculated based on the "Monthly Average Wage Table of Shanghai Factory Workers" published in the January issue of the "Economic Statistics Monthly" published by the Economic Statistics Research Institute.

Moreover, our country's production is extremely backward, and now it is in a period of war that is destroying all production facilities. Therefore, the high rise in prices, on the one hand, reflects the fall in the external value of the currency, and on the other hand, it strengthens the exploitation of foreign goods on our national wealth. In other words, it is enough to promote the collapse of our country's finance, currency system, and the entire national economy.

On the surface: the income of comprador capital (merchants who specialize in promoting foreign goods) and quasi-comprador capital (such as producers who use foreign goods as raw materials, and sellers of their products, etc.) may also have increased to some extent: thereby creating an appearance of prosperity in bank deposit accounts. But it cannot compensate for the loss of the monetary value of other wealth capital, and it cannot compensate for the loss of the entire national wealth. That is obvious.

From the facts: The high rise in domestic prices has now made the entire people's lives feel a severe threat. If this threat is not eliminated, or even expands, the result will be the danger of shaking the entire social order. What is even more dangerous is that it will directly shake the economic foundation of the war. Recently, the United Kingdom loaned money to China to jointly balance foreign exchange. If we do not talk about the political significance, but analyze its economic significance, then everyone knows that it is "to maintain its commodity market for exports to China." In other words: only because China's prices have already exceeded the general purchasing power level, their commodity market in China, in addition to the violent obstruction of the Japanese side, has also erected a major obstacle. Balancing China's exchange rate is to prevent the continued rise in China's import prices.

Moreover, the reason why we attach importance to this issue is not so much because of the current necessity, but rather because of the future, we must first plan ahead to "nip problems in the bud." Because the main reason for the current soaring prices is due to the impact of the war; then, in the future, when there is no hope of ending the war, that is, when all the reasons that stimulate rising prices continue to exist, there will inevitably be a risk of unlimited escalation.

(5) The National Government's Countermeasures to Balance Prices

The National Government has long had the determination to control prices during wartime; only because this kind of control has not yet escaped the experimental stage in European and American countries with extremely close-knit economic organizations. Although Germany's "appropriate price system" has been praised by the world, it is impossible to imitate in China, where the economic organization is like a pile of loose sand. However, in fact, it is no longer possible to allow it to go on like this for a long time. Moreover, if the speculative elements in prices can be eliminated, it can balance a lot. As long as all industries can put their consciences at ease, it can be easily solved. Therefore, recently, the provincial and municipal governments were finally ordered to organize price balancing committees, and work together with provincial banks and local banks to implement the balancing of prices of daily necessities for the people, and stipulated three types of fair price standards:

(1) For items whose production and transportation costs have not been affected by the war or have been slightly affected, the average price of the three or one years before the war shall prevail.

(2) For items whose production and transportation costs have been affected by the war, their costs after the war plus a considerable profit shall be the standard.

(3) For items whose costs are not easy to calculate, the total amount of capital required for their operation plus a considerable profit shall be the standard, and it is stipulated that the items for balancing prices shall be limited to daily necessities.

The organization of the Price Balancing Committee is jointly organized by the local government, the provincial bank or local bank, and the chambers of commerce and trade associations. For factories, merchants, or private individuals who hoard a large number of daily necessities, the committee may request the local competent authority to force them to sell them at the assessed price. It is also stipulated that those who violate the following items with the intention of speculative manipulation may be reported to the court in accordance with the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce:

(1) The quantity of mutual sales among the same industry shall not exceed the current quantity of inventory.

(2) Those in the same industry who do not operate daily necessities shall not mutually buy or sell futures on the market.

(3) The buying and selling of daily necessities shall not establish exchange markets.

However, Shanghai, which still occupies an important position in the national economy and is also the place with the most speculation and the fastest rise in prices, has unfortunately been surrounded in the occupied area, and political power can no longer play an active role. If it is not for the people to come forward and govern themselves, there is simply no way to proceed. Therefore, whether the citizens of Shanghai can be freed from improper exploitation and severe oppression on prices depends only on whether the leaders of various industries can come forward to support and strive for this.

### Germany's Price Stabilization Policy

— Translated by Chen Baorong

This article was written by the German economist Mr. Wagner. It is translated from the Japanese International Economic Weekly, No. 991. The original title is "Price Formation and Its Stabilization Policy"—Translator

A Monetary System Based on Labor

The central issue of price policy is none other than the issue of price stability. It is about how to prevent changes in the price market when drastic changes occur within the economy. There are often various reasons for thinking that such a situation is irresistible. Even the so-called "quantity boom" is based on a "price boom." In the past, capital and its income always occupied the center of economic life. But today, the key to analyzing all economic phenomena lies in labor and its payments. Therefore, although Germany's monetary system was initially established on the basis of gold, it has now been changed to take labor as its foundation. Initially, we believed that the best way to guarantee the future material life of the people was to accumulate currency. Now, we have lost confidence in this guarantee of currency, and what has replaced it is our right to labor, and we must give it permanent labor rights. And not only the right to engage in labor, but also the guarantee of income at any time. We have lost confidence in it; what has replaced it is our right to labor, and we must give it permanent labor rights. And not only the right to engage in labor, but also the guarantee of income at any time.

Germany's New Price Policy

Since the economic theory of the German National Socialist government has fundamentally adopted this new attitude, the impact of price fluctuations and the various reasons for their occurrence can be explained by economic fluctuations. Therefore, the new price policy of the National Socialist government is not only satisfied with eliminating the current obstacles. In the past, the most outstanding price commissioners only needed to solve their practical problems with agile methods; but now, in addition to practical problems, it is also necessary to solve their fundamental principles. That is, how to make price changes fully adapt to today's economic life? The high price policy, which strives to raise prices and seek to overcome panic, may not be able to stimulate the general economy and induce a boom; but the soaring of prices has various major dangers that cannot but be deeply warned against. In the transition period, although high prices may not be without the role of revitalizing the economy, they are also creating deadly toxins at the same time. Therefore, the German National Socialism conditions' adoption of the policy of preventing price increases, and this kind of attempt, is essentially completely different from the policies generally implemented. In a word, it is to seek to establish an appropriate price.

Establishing an Appropriate Price

When an economic tendency toward high prices is found in all aspects, then on the one hand, it has affected the external economic relations and caused a bad effect; on the other hand, the raw material economy has changed due to the increase in burdens. Moreover, this tendency still cannot fully overcome the panic that dominates various economic sectors. In this situation: On the one hand, the National Socialist government sets the "highest price" so as to fully and rationally complete the vigorous plan in the price policy, in order to maintain the possibility of construction. On the other hand, it will conduct individual and fundamental reviews of various economic parts. It is necessary to make the prices of each part correspond to the characteristics of that part; that is, to individually apply various special controls.

In examining price policy, one cannot only focus on monetary prices. If this point of view is used, it will not be consistent with its purpose. Usually, when prices fall, one always hopes for their recovery. But the height of prices is not the main issue. The really main thing is whether the mutual relationship between prices is balanced? Whether it is mutually adapted to the national economic life and other factors? In other words, whether the price level maintains an appropriate relationship is the focus of the problem.

The so-called "appropriate relationship" is generally determined by the national economy. Therefore, the concept of price must be criticized from the standpoint of the entire national economy, that is, on the one hand, it must be criticized from the perspective of operation, and on the other hand, it must be criticized by the market price.

Today's prices in Germany are adapted to production on the one hand, and adapted to labor income on the other. The only thing that the German head of state is most concerned about for the German economy today is how to raise the necessary labor force.

The Task of Germany's Price Policy

In recent years, although Germany's price policy has implemented its function of stabilizing economic life, it is still not enough to consider this as having fulfilled its task. Because in a certain period, we should try to reduce the impact of foreign price increases (that is, reduce the impact of the rise in world prices); in a certain period, we should try to help develop sales markets and establish appropriate and effective prices. After the technological development of new raw materials, we should then determine how to sell them to the market at what price? Even in solving all the needs of social policy, as well as solving technical problems in supply, new tasks can generally occur in price policy.

### Finance: The Credit of Legal Tender Is as Strong as Vajra; "Counterfeit Money" Cannot Destroy It; Value Is Higher Than "Counterfeit Money"

Since the puppet "Provisional Government" in North China stipulated the prohibition of the use of legal tender from March 11, and at the same time forced the people to exchange legal tender for puppet banknotes, and implemented severe penalties, in the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the legal tender of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications continued to circulate as usual without any obstacles. Moreover, foreign banks still regard legal tender as the only currency of our country. Although deposits of "United Reserve Notes" (banknotes of the United Reserve Bank of North China) are also accepted, Chinese and foreign banks all write the words "United Reserve Notes" on the deposit slips and account books to show the difference. Regarding the exchange rate between legal tender and "United Reserve Notes", although the puppet "Provisional Government" has regulations to forcibly lower the number, the price of legal tender in Tianjin is always higher than that of "United Reserve Notes". As for the transaction of exchanging legal tender for "United Reserve Notes", it is handled by general small money shops. There is a dark market price every day. The lowest price of "United Reserve Notes" was once 90% (that is, 1,000 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for 1,100 yuan of "United Reserve Notes"), and the highest was once 8 yuan (that is, 1,000 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for 1,008 yuan of "United Reserve Notes"). The price was between 1,024 yuan for two or three months. Recently, the market price has mostly been around 1,0890 yuan. The market prices from April 11 to 15 are listed below:

Market Price of 100 Yuan of Legal Tender Converted into "United Reserve Notes"

| Date   | Market Price |
| ------ | ----------- |
| April 11 | 108 yuan 5 jiao    |
| April 12 | 108 yuan 13 fen |
| April 13 | 108 yuan 25 fen |
| April 14 | 109 yuan 13 fen |
| April 15 | 109 yuan 4 jiao    |

British Pure Gold Unchanged

Due to the weekly holiday, there were only one or two members present at the cash dark market situation, but there were no supply and demand positions, so the price was not called out. There were also no transactions at the money exchange retail stores. It is heard that the selling price is still 2,075 yuan.

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in jewelry stores has not changed. The Da Tong Hang is still 211 yuan, the Xin Tong Hang is 209 yuan, and the purchase price is 203 yuan.

London, 15th: British pure gold is still unchanged, still calculated at 7 pounds 8 shillings 6 pence per ounce.

### Silver Slightly Rises, Large Bars Flat

London, 15th: In the silver market, Indian and American merchants slightly settled transactions, and speculators slightly sold off. The market is flat, and large bars remain flat in both near and far terms. New York: The American spot market remains stagnant. Bombay: The Indian silver market is calm, spot and April are up 1 anna each, and May is up 2 annas.

### The Inside Story of Woolen Cloth Trading

— Fu Shi Sheng

(Continued from April 10th)

(5) Invoicing

Except for brokers reselling, the customer naturally understands that a slightly larger amount is invoiced to deduct commissions. Those who purchase directly from firms or factories will naturally receive accurate invoices. However, it is also common to add a certain amount, which is intended as a standard practice to avoid market disruptions. Domestic factories often invoice in this way because they frequently have hidden discounts that are deducted when settling accounts. Additionally, parties with frequent transactions and close relationships often issue an invoice with a "照" (zhào, meaning "as is") character (presumably representing the previous market price). This all refers to buying and selling among industry peers. Invoicing to retail customers is another matter altogether. Since customs duties are often involved in transporting goods to customers, in addition to using carbon paper to avoid errors on the original invoice, a false invoice is often issued according to the customer's instructions.

(6) Price Guarantee

Whether for whole cases, split bolts, or cut pieces, the practice of price guarantees exists among industry peers. A price guarantee (meaning guaranteeing the purchase price won't be unprofitable) can be verbally agreed upon or noted on the invoice. The standard price guarantee period is generally limited to five days (at most ten days). If, within the time limit, the same quality, pattern, and brand of goods become available at a lower price, the difference must be compensated. Price guarantee transactions are the most reliable, so the words "price guarantee" are usually avoided unless absolutely necessary. Price guarantees are more common for futures contracts, followed by common-grade Chinese clothing woolens. Price guarantees for Western-style suit woolens are quite rare. (End)

### Coal　Dalian Coal Also Arriving　Worthy of Attention

Although the market has sufficient reserves of Wenzhou charcoal, shipping from the Ou River has been disrupted. If it is blockaded, the charcoal supply will be affected. Therefore, traders are preparing for shortages. In reality, the weather is warming, sales are declining, and demand is very low. Recently, a certain ship arrived with grass-wrapped coal from Dalian, totaling five to six hundred bags, each weighing over forty catties. It is being sold for around three yuan per dan (unit of weight), with brokers actively peddling it. It is said that this is a trial run, and if there is a market, larger shipments will be sent.

### Metals　Black Iron Billets　Spot Shortage

Transactions in black iron billets are booming due to frantic purchases by businesses from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and also by local factories producing thermos bottles, printing materials, and toys. As a result, there is a shortage of spot goods, and the standard price is skyrocketing, rising to 31.50 yuan per 200 pounds. It is reported that a certain metal shop on North Suzhou Road received over 50 tons of spot goods yesterday and is offering them at 31.60 yuan. Over ten tons have already been sold, but demand remains high. It is said that the shop, to maintain good relations, is only selling small quantities and is unwilling to sell in bulk.

### Imports and Exports　Large Shipments of Fir Lumber Arriving in Shanghai　Many Goods Also Arriving from Xingang

Large quantities of fir lumber are being shipped in. Another three ships arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 126,850 pieces of fir lumber from Fuzhou.

Yesterday's imports included 40 cases of fresh eggs from Xingang, as well as 26 cases of golden needle mushrooms and 32 bags of stone powder, also from Xingang.

Yesterday, 30 cases of egg yolk and white were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods　French and Western Linings Flood the Market

Since the war, Japanese linings have stopped being imported, and the cost of Western goods has soared due to exchange rate issues. Yesterday, at the A-277 Public Tea House, they were selling for 9.5 jiao (cents), causing buyers to use summer cloth linings and domestic goods as substitutes. With the fall of Jiujiang, summer cloth is also in short supply. Domestic French and Western linings are experiencing a significant surge in sales. Furthermore, after being designated as military supplies by the government, the procurement of raw materials became difficult, resulting in 70-80% of the products being woven with coarse wax and thin thread. Small factories are springing up, leading to a flood of French and Western linings in the market. Factories are competing with each other to offer low prices. Dealers and Western clothing stores are seeking to push prices down. Prices are gradually declining. Yesterday, Hong Sheng, an old brand, was still selling at 7.75 jiao per yard. Hua Xing, Yong Cheng, Xin Hua, Li Xing, and other brands were selling for only 5.5 jiao per yard. Brokers reselling can still deduct a commission of 2-3 jiao per bolt. It is said that their own cost is only around 4.6 jiao.

### Sugar Market　Imported Sugar Continues to Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the price of imported sugar rose sharply. The association set the price. No. 24 Dutch coarse white was traded at 25.90 yuan for 50 bags of spot goods. Re-exported goods were quoted at 17.80 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B Mark Western warehouse goods were 25.85 yuan, and Eastern warehouse goods were 25.75 yuan, an increase of 0.20 to 0.30 yuan compared to the previous day. Domestic sugar was offered at 24.30-24.40 yuan for Three-Tip White and 24.10-24.00 yuan for Top-Grade Ice, with only a few scattered transactions totaling over 200 bags. Shipments of Shimen sliced brown sugar continued to arrive, but prices have not yet been set.

### Price Increase Statistics for Various Industries in Shanghai Over the Past Year

— Hui

Everyone knows that Shanghai's environment over the past year has been awaiting the arrival of final victory. Due to the expansion of the war, prices have been soaring. This can be seen in the retail price index. In fact, this has been unfolding in a way that has made people living in Shanghai feel threatened and unable to maintain their livelihoods, and their hearts are filled with anxiety and frustration.

Originally, wartime prices are inevitably more expensive than usual due to transportation disruptions and supply-demand imbalances. The hoarding and profiteering of unscrupulous merchants are also important factors contributing to high prices. Therefore, the soaring prices in Shanghai over the past year are a natural result. However, many prices have become distorted, mainly due to speculative manipulation and the excessive taxation by special interests. At the same time, due to government control of foreign exchange, ordinary commodities have been restricted. Manufacturers wanting to purchase foreign goods have had to buy high-priced foreign exchange on the black market, which has increased costs. Therefore, the high prices in Shanghai have been compounded by these three distorted factors.

Now, let's statistically analyze the price increases published in newspapers by various industries over the past year. There have been a total of 168 cases. Excluding 18 cases of repeated price increases, the net total is 150 cases, representing 150 separate industries and business/factory units that have raised prices. These 150 cases include 16 commodity categories: electricity, fuel, clothing, medicine, food and beverage, hygiene, decoration, transportation, culture, metal, daily necessities, construction, leather, raw materials, consumables, and public utilities.

Comparing the number of price increases by month, August had the most with 41 cases, followed by September with 27, July with 23, June with 21, October with 17, November with 13, December with 9, April with 7, May with 5, January with 3, February with 2, and March with none (including repeated price increases). It must be mentioned that the higher number of price increases in June, July, August, and September was due to the sharp contraction of the foreign exchange black market at that time, which led merchants to use it as an excuse to raise prices. Therefore, the number of cases was higher than in other months. Further analyzing the types of commodities with price increases, daily necessities ranked first with 41 cases, food and beverages ranked second with 34 cases, clothing ranked third with 22 cases, medicine ranked fourth with 12 cases, and electricity, fuel, and cultural items each ranked fifth with 7 cases. Leather ranked sixth with 5 cases, decorative items and transportation ranked seventh with 4 cases, consumables, raw materials, construction, and public utilities each ranked eighth with 3 cases, and hygiene ranked last with 2 cases.

The types of goods with price increases and the percentage increases are listed below:

(1) Seasoning powder: increased by 10% to 35%.

(2) Shaoxing wine: Jingzhuang brand increased by 0.256 yuan per catty, Xiaohuadiao increased by 0.28 yuan per catty, Taidiao increased by 0.32 yuan, and so on.

(3) Noodles: cut noodles increased by 300 cash per catty, yellow noodles increased by 320 cash per catty, skins the same, vermicelli increased by 200 cash per catty, and so on. (To be continued)

Good News of Counter-Offensives from All Fronts

### Shanghai Organizations　Send Telegram to Chairman Chiang　People in the Isolated Island Support Resistance, Pledge Unwavering Determination to Exert Utmost Efforts to Win Final Victory

Recently, the Chinese army on the fronts of Central Hubei, Northern Jiangxi, Northern Hunan, Eastern Henan, Southern China, and Southern Shanxi has begun counter-offensives, making smooth progress with tremendous momentum, posing a serious threat to the Japanese army. London newspapers have even published these messages in large characters, wishing China final victory. As a result, the morale of all sectors is extremely boosted. Various organizations in this city believe that although this full-scale counter-offensive is not the final overall counter-offensive to achieve final victory, it has achieved the goal of containing Japanese forces, shattering the dream of seeking peace through conspiracy, and fully demonstrating China's strong resistance capabilities, giving the international community a better impression. The bravery and dedication of all the soldiers have particularly inspired the people of the country. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission to express condolences and appreciation. The original text is as follows:

To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission in Chongqing, and to all soldiers and officers on all fronts: Since the July 7th Incident, 21 months have passed. Although the enemy has mobilized troops from the entire country and wielded sharp weapons to launch fierce attacks against us, fortunately, thanks to your wise decision-making and skillful command, all soldiers and officers have fought with common hatred against the enemy, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese army. Recently, you have again launched counter-offensives on all fronts, making smooth progress with tremendous momentum, posing an even more serious threat to the enemy. The news of victory has been deeply inspiring. We respectfully send this telegram to express our condolences and appreciation, hoping that you will continue to work hard, annihilate the ugly enemy, and restore our homeland. Although the people of the isolated island are in a difficult situation, they support the resistance and are unwavering in their determination. We pledge to exert our utmost efforts to win the final victory and complete the great task of national reconstruction. We respectfully offer our sincere feelings and humbly request your consideration and acceptance. Signed, Various Organizations of Shanghai.

### Large Numbers of Japanese Troops　May Be Transferred Elsewhere

The Continental Daily News reported that according to eyewitnesses, Japanese troops who had entered the Shanghai area from Nanjing and various parts of Central China were moving towards Wusong yesterday morning (the 15th). Large-scale troop movements were seen along the Wusong Road area in the morning and afternoon. Yesterday morning, news came from the Hongqiao area that several large units of troops from the interior were passing along Hongqiao Road, heading towards Zhabei. This was the second day of large-scale Japanese troop movements along the road. According to reliable sources, the troops entering the Shanghai area this time arrived by train from Nanjing to Suzhou and then walked to Shanghai, accompanied by artillery units and supply vehicles. It is not yet clear where they are moving to. A Japanese military spokesman also acknowledged the possibility of troop movements but said that he had no specific information about it. According to the views of observers in this city, since these troops are now moving along the Wusong Road area, they may be transported elsewhere by ship later. However, the observers did not speculate on their next destination.

### Passengers Stranded from the Libao Wheel　Special Ship Returns

Approved by the Ningbo Defense Headquarters

Negotiated by the Dinghai Association

The Dinghai Association is very concerned about the fellow villagers stranded from the Libao Wheel. In addition to finding ways to receive them, they also plan to hire a foreign ship to return to Dinghai to avoid displacement. Previously, the association telegraphed the Ningbo Defense Headquarters for instructions, which was reported in detail in various newspapers. Now it is learned that the association has received a reply approving the hiring of a ship to directly release them to Dinghai, but only once. Those who wish to go to Dinghai can contact the association directly.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs　Permits Summer Cloth to be Shipped to Shanghai

Advising the Ministry to Instruct Customs to Release

After the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulated the prohibition of the transportation of 54 kinds of goods, since summer cloth is a hemp product and belongs to one of the 54 kinds, the Zhejiang and Ou customs immediately prohibited loading and export. Later, after the Shanghai and Wanzai chambers of commerce repeatedly telegraphed to request the lifting of the ban, stating that the Jiangxi summer cloth transportation was solely for the purpose of providing clothing materials to the people of the country, it is now heard that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has approved the request after receiving the telegram, and has advised the Ministry of Finance to instruct customs to release it.

### Two Thousand Japanese Troops Rush to Aid　Fierce Fighting in Ben Niu　Two Japanese Planes Bomb Tianmashan　Japanese Troops in Liuhe Have Broken Through and Collapsed

Before twelve o'clock yesterday morning, a large number of fully armed Japanese army soldiers departed from the Jiangwan and Wusong areas, traveling in fifty to sixty large trucks, each carrying more than thirty soldiers, passing through Zhabei Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, Republic New Road, Jiaotong Road and headed west to increase aid. It is heard that there has been fierce fighting in the Ben Niu section of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway.

Japanese planes bomb Tianmashan　The Japanese troops who "swept" Tianmashan in Songjiang were almost completely annihilated by the guerrillas. The Japanese army was still unwilling to give up. Yesterday (the 15th), it mobilized two bombers and flew to bomb it wildly. The guerrillas had received prior intelligence and were all hiding in the trenches, so there was no damage. The Japanese army exhausted dozens of bombs.

Japanese troops in Liuhe collapsed　The Japanese troops in Liuhe, after being besieged by guerrillas day and night, were exhausted and suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday evening (the 15th), they broke through and collapsed. The guerrillas immediately tracked them down and killed Captain Isogai and more than ten soldiers. The guerrillas also suffered slight damage. The town was recovered by the guerrillas that night.

### Negotiations on Detained Ships Yield No Results　Portuguese Ships All Suspended

Portuguese Consul Has Requested the Ambassador to Japan to Negotiate　Deyao Pledged to Italian Merchants, Japan Allows Navigation　American Merchants and Huamei Ships Unload Goods Today

The Japanese warship's detention of Portuguese ships has not been answered after protests. Various shipping companies have decided to suspend all navigation and request the ambassador to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government. American merchants and Huamei ships unload goods today. Deyao, because it is mortgaged to Italian merchants, Japan has agreed to sail as usual. The details are recorded below:

No Reply After Protest　Since the ten Portuguese merchant ships, Mida, Tang Qiao, Tang Bei, Tang Lu, Hailong, Rude, Baode, Fulu, and Dade Libao, were detained, they are now anchored in various pontoons in Yangshupu. Japanese warships have dispatched Japanese troops to station on each ship to monitor them. Although the passengers have been released, the cargo and crew are still on board. The Portuguese Consul General to Shanghai protested to Japanese Consul General Miura. As of the night before last, the Portuguese Consul General had not received a reply from the Japanese Consul General, and the cargo on the ships was still not allowed to be unloaded first, resulting in significant losses for the ships.

Portuguese Merchants Decided to Suspend All Navigation　The Portuguese ship companies, in view of the Japanese warships' unreasonable detention of ships, forcibly taking down the Portuguese flag and raising the Japanese flag, although the Consul General protested to Japan, the Japanese warships continued to detain the ships, which was very indignant. They have requested the Portuguese Ambassador to China to telegraph the Japanese Ambassador to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government. Before the detained ship incident is resolved, all Portuguese ships in China will be temporarily suspended. Today, the Portuguese ship Avé Maria, represented by the Xie Xing Firm, which sails to Changyinsha, was originally intended to sail from Changyinsha to Shanghai, but has now suspended sailing and is temporarily anchored at Changyinsha.

Deyao Follows Usual Route Due to Mortgage　The Deyao Wheel of the Portuguese merchant Liuzhou Company, which sails on the North Sha line, arrived in Shanghai from Haimen, Jiangsu, at 2:30 p.m. yesterday and docked at Wharf No. 13 on the Bund of Beijing Road. It is scheduled to sail as usual at 9:30 a.m. today. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday from the Italian Yi Hua Foreign Company that the ship has been mortgaged to the Italian Yi Hua, and the Italian Consul General to Shanghai has notified the Japanese authorities, so the ship can sail as usual, which is different from the situation of other Portuguese ships. The Japanese Navy has allowed the ship to sail on its original route.

American Merchants' Agents Unload Goods　Since the Portuguese ships Tang Qiao, Tang Bei, and Tang Lu, represented by the American Huamei Company, were detained, the cargo on each ship has not been unloaded. Therefore, the company reported to the American Consul General to Shanghai and negotiated with the Japanese side to unload the goods, because although the ships belong to Portuguese merchants, the cargo loaded is carried by American Huamei. Today, Fang has approved the request and allowed the cargo to be unloaded first. According to a senior Chinese employee of the company yesterday, the company has decided to send tugboats to unload the goods tomorrow, Monday. As for the cargo of the Mida and other ships, the Japanese side still does not allow it to be unloaded first.

### The First Phase of Military Supplies Public Bonds　Will Be Issued on June 1st

Totaling 300 Million Yuan, it is Unregistered　The People of the Whole Country Expressed Their Willingness to Subscribe

In order to replenish the expenses of the Second War of Resistance, the National Government will issue the Republic of China's 28th Year Military Supplies Public Bonds, with a national currency of 600 million yuan, issued in two phases, 300 million yuan each on June 1st and October 1st, with an annual interest rate of six percent and a term of 25 years. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday from banking circles that although the first phase of the public bonds has been scheduled for issuance on June 1st, the unified tax and tobacco and alcohol tax revenue has been designated as a fund for the repayment of principal and interest, which will be kept in custody by the Shanghai National Debt Fund Management Committee, and the Central Bank and its entrusted banks will be the payment agencies. However, the National Debt Committee and the Central Bank have not yet received orders from the Ministry of Finance. It is now decided to comply after receiving the order. It is heard that the public bonds are unregistered, and raised according to the face value. Because the public bonds are for replenishing the expenses of the War of Resistance, and the guarantee is very reliable, the people of the whole country have expressed their willingness to subscribe and give economic assistance to the government, so as to achieve the final victory of the War of Resistance.

### National Spiritual Mobilization: Announcement to Compatriots, Advancing Theory and Practice Simultaneously, Eradicating Traitors and Their Accomplices, Telegram to All Provinces and Cities Nationwide for Joint Effort

From today until the 23rd of this month, all provinces and cities across the country will uniformly hold National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. The General Headquarters of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of all sectors in this city has specifically formulated propaganda methods and schedules, and notified all sectors to implement them consistently. Today is the General Propaganda Day. The General Headquarters of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of this city has specially issued an announcement to compatriots and telegraphed the whole country, stating the Three Meanings. The details are recorded separately as follows:

Propaganda Methods: (1) From April 17th to 23rd of this year is the second phase of the Anti-Japanese War National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. (2) The propaganda schedule for this propaganda week is as follows: (1) April 17th is the General Propaganda Day; (2) April 18th is the Citizenry Propaganda Day; (3) April 19th is the Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce Propaganda Day; (4) April 20th is the Education Sector Propaganda Day; (5) April 21st is the Cultural Sector Propaganda Day; (6) April 22nd is the Professional Sector Propaganda Day; (7) April 23rd is the Women's Sector Propaganda Day. (3) During this Propaganda Week, all sectors should strive to implement the following points: (1) Encourage the people within each sector to unanimously participate in the branch organizations of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of their respective sectors; (2) All citizens should hold public oaths of the National Covenant separately; (3) The National Spiritual Mobilization Associations and their branch organizations of each sector should hold the first National Day meeting; (4) Each sector should send representatives to give lectures within the organizations of their respective sectors on the content of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, and study and promote it together. Major and minor schools, as well as supplementary schools, etc., should conduct large-unit education on National Spiritual Mobilization; (5) Village chiefs of each village, factory directors of each factory, managers of each store, principals of each school, and heads of each family, etc., should urge their subordinates to consistently implement the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline; (4) All sectors should reprint as much as possible the single editions of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and its implementation measures, and widely circulate them; (5) All newspapers should publish special issues; (6) The propaganda slogans for this Propaganda Week are as follows: (1) Nation First, Ethnicity First; (2) Military Affairs First, Victory First; (3) Concentration of Will, Concentration of Strength.

Announcement to Compatriots: The General Headquarters of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of all sectors of Shanghai announces to all compatriots in the city as follows: Dear compatriots of the whole city, on this day when the full line begins the general counter-offensive, we hold the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week, and we truly feel infinite excitement, and its profound and great significance cannot be exhausted in a single word. On this day when the propaganda week begins, this association respectfully offers three meanings to encourage each other with all compatriots in the city:

First, the meaning of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline is profound, broad, and all-encompassing, not only applicable to the current period of the Anti-Japanese War and national construction, but also to be regarded as the only guideline for establishing the country for thousands of years to come. Therefore, all citizens of our city must recite and deeply understand this outline, taking nation first, ethnicity first, military affairs first, victory first, concentration of will, and concentration of strength as the absolute common goal, being conscientious and never perfunctory, uniting the hearts of 450 million compatriots into one heart, and gathering the strength of 450 million compatriots into one strength. Then, not only is the destruction of the current violent enemy foreseeable, but we can also become a strong guarantee of world peace and a firm cornerstone of world justice. Therefore, the village chiefs of each village, the factory directors of each factory, the managers of each store, the principals of each school, and the heads of each family, etc., must lead their subordinates to study carefully, fathers advise sons and brothers encourage each other, teachers instruct and friends guide each other, and take the instructions of this outline as the highest criterion. Every word and every sentence must strictly abide by the scope indicated by the outline, preventing all far-fetched and distorted interpretations. Even if there are other meanings that can be pointed out, they should only be uniformly interpreted by the highest leader who personally formulated this outline, so as to avoid the danger of divergent opinions and confusion. If we can sincerely believe and earnestly implement it, we will be worthy of being the descendants of our Yellow Emperor and the sons and daughters of China.

Second, the points indicated in the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline are all important items for practical action. Therefore, we must not only strive for knowledge but also strive for action. The life of drunken stupor and death must be corrected, and the vigorous spirit of striving must be cultivated. The habit of perfunctory survival must be eliminated, and the attempt of selfishness and self-interest must be broken. The divergent and complicated thoughts must be corrected. All these items should be practiced one by one in our daily life, without any pretense. Since Shanghai became an isolated island, a small number of people, as if lost, have inevitably become corrupted in thought and behavior without realizing it. The root of Shanghai's abnormal prosperity lies in this. There are also many instances where thoughts and opinions have formed a unity in principle, but there are still many divergences in the details. If this complication continues for a long time, it will inevitably lead to the dispersion of the people's will and harm the war effort. Therefore, from now on, our thoughts and actions must not be allowed to flow into corruption, nor must we allow our people to flow into deterioration. We must be of one heart and one mind, be loyal and trustworthy, abandon small differences and seek great unity, and work hard for the Anti-Japanese War and national construction.

Third, the enemy, due to the failure of military aggression, has turned to developing political conspiracies, using the scum of our minority nationalities in an attempt to shake our overall situation of the Anti-Japanese War. Wang Jingwei received the special knowledge of the late Premier and should have done his best to serve the country. Unexpectedly, since 1927, he has been fickle and exhausted all the ugly态of turning clouds into rain. Our central government has been generous, hoping that he would reflect deeply. Unexpectedly, this time he colluded with the enemy country and openly sought surrender. This kind of national traitor who has lost his humanity is abandoned by the people of the country. Now, Wang Jingwei not only does not know how to repent, but also secretly sends his henchmen to Shanghai to stir up trouble. All compatriots in our city should unanimously give the most severe condemnation to this national disgrace, eradicate his stirrings, and extinguish his conspiracy, so that there is no room for the existence of national traitors on Chinese soil. Combining the three meanings is the three most urgent tasks for all compatriots in our city at present. We earnestly hope that we will work together to achieve success. The General Headquarters of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of all sectors of Shanghai.

Telegram to the Whole Country: To the National Spiritual Mobilization Associations of all provinces and cities, for the public perusal of all compatriots in all provinces and cities: Today, Shanghai is holding the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. The association now respectfully presents three meanings with the most sincere enthusiasm on behalf of the four million citizens of the city, and encourages each other with the compatriots of the whole country: The meaning of the outline is profound, broad, and all-encompassing, not only the highest principle during the current period of the Anti-Japanese War and national construction, but also the only guideline for establishing the country for thousands of years to come. All our compatriots across the country should have a copy in hand, study it morning and evening, and strive to thoroughly study its contents and thoroughly understand its essence, so that our words and deeds have a criterion, and our will and strength can be concentrated. The outline points out that all are important items for our daily practice. The thoughts of confusion and divergence, and the habits of perfunctory survival, should be completely eradicated first. Do not be corrupt, do not deteriorate, with the vigorous spirit of striving and the steadfast spirit of excellence, then the destruction of the enemy country can be expected soon, and the great cause of national construction can also be completed quickly. Wang Jingwei colluded with the enemy country and openly begged for surrender. His personality is so despicable that even ten thousand deaths are not enough to cover his guilt. Recently, he also sent his henchmen to Shanghai to stir up trouble. All our compatriots across the country have unanimously condemned him, vowing to completely eradicate him. I still hope that all compatriots across the country will severely punish the remnants of Wang Jingwei, so that there is no room for the existence of national traitors on Chinese soil. Urgent words, I hope we will work together. The General Headquarters of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of all sectors of Shanghai.

### Methods for Handling War Losses: Explanation of "Deferred Assets," Continuing Business Enterprises with Excessive Losses to be Included in Assets and Amortized Annually for Compensation

It is reported that the "Methods for Handling War Losses" drafted by Xi Yushu, Chief Accountant of the Shanghai Public Trust Accounting Firm, has been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which believes that the war losses proposed in the original presentation can be approved as deferred assets to be offset by annual surplus amortization. All sectors in this city are paying close attention because it concerns the final accounts of enterprises. However, the name "deferred assets" in the approval is a specialized term and is not easy to understand. The original text previously published by Accountant Xi is also something that all sectors deeply want to know the details of. The reporter has interviewed Mr. Xi to solicit his comments and obtained his speech as follows: The so-called deferred assets, in accounting terms, refer to the expenses or losses of a continuing business enterprise that cannot be borne at one time, and must first be included in the assets and amortized annually, such as start-up expenses and the disposal costs of machines when they are no longer applicable, and business rights, etc., are all amortized annually in accounting. War losses are an unprecedented catastrophe, and can also be handled in this way, so that all industries can recuperate and gradually recover. My suggestion for the war-time commercial accounting treatment method is based on the fact that since the military uprising, various businesses in the war zones and near the war zones have suffered extremely heavy losses. If the settlement is handled in the usual way, there will be many obstacles. Therefore, I have submitted four items of methods to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that war losses be treated as deferred assets and gradually compensated, so that the remaining businesses can gradually enter a safe path and will not shake the foundation of the national economy.

### Last Night's Bad Weather: Communications Interrupted for a Long Time, Almost Isolating Shanghai from Other Regions, Recovering Only After Several Hours

The Continental Daily reports that yesterday (the 15th), the Pacific commercial communications between Guam and San Francisco were interrupted, and rare weather conditions almost isolated Shanghai from the rest of the world. The communications were interrupted around noon, and the wireless companies handling commercial telegrams between Shanghai and various world centers were unable to work from 11:00 AM. After several hours, work resumed last night, but the cables between Guam and San Francisco were still unable to be used. It was not known for sure yesterday when they could be repaired. At the same time, the telegram companies are now handling telegram traffic through the Pacific coast and transferring to the United States. Telegrams sent from Shanghai first go to Manila, and then wireless from Manila to San Francisco. According to the Xujiahui Observatory last night, the hindrance affecting wireless communications yesterday was not caused by storms or air currents. According to experts, this type of hindrance is far above the center point of the storm and is not uncommon, but usually only lasts for a short period of time, rarely more than two or three hours. Within the area affected, wireless communications cannot pass. This hindrance forms a dead spot, and sound cannot pass through this point. Furthermore, according to shipping personnel, there has been dense fog in the area between Shanghai and Hong Kong in the past few days, and the coastal areas of North China have also been affected.

Dance Hall Group of the Refugee Relief Society: Donation Results Announced

The Donation Committee of the Dance Hall Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held its second standing committee meeting yesterday. A total of 16 standing committee members, including Yuan Ludeng, Gao Xinbao, Xie Baosheng, Yu Kefei, and Sun Jile, attended. They discussed the progress of the association's affairs at length and passed a resolution to hold a charity tea dance competition. However, in order to seek universal consent, the plan will be immediately sent to various dance halls to solicit opinions, with a deadline of five days for a reply, so that work can begin. In addition, the results of this donation by the group have been announced, raising more than 14,000 yuan. The best performers in Class A are Daxin, Lido, and Xianle, while those in Class B are Xuan Gong, Far East, and International. It is heard that the association is drafting commendation measures to encourage them.

### Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings from Past Dynasties: Works to be Changed and Displayed Tomorrow, Only Half of the Total Shown in the First Display

The exhibition of Chinese calligraphy and paintings from past dynasties, collected by more than 50 famous collectors in Shanghai, has gathered more than 300 famous works from past dynasties. Due to the limitation of space, they could not be fully displayed. It is heard that starting from this week, all of them will be replaced. After the replacement, those displayed for the first time will not be seen again. Those who love art and want to see the full picture of the exhibits of the association should not miss this last opportunity.

### Tang Wenzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, etc.: Public Memorial for Shen Meisou, Held at Jing'an Temple Tomorrow on His 90th Birthday

Mr. Shen Zipei was a famous scholar of classics, history, and literature in modern times, also known as Meisou. His calligraphy was exceptionally good, and those who obtained his calligraphy treasures cherished them like jewels. Meisou served as a provincial treasurer and presided over educational administration many times in the late Qing Dynasty. He also served as the supervisor of Nanyang University (now Shanghai Jiaotong University). Famous figures such as Tang Wenzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Shi Jiushao, and Jing Qiankun were all his disciples. Tomorrow (the 18th) is Meisou's 90th birthday. Tang Wenzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, and others have specially invited his students, friends, and former colleagues to hold a memorial ceremony at Jing'an Temple on Jing'an Temple Road at 12:00 noon tomorrow to commemorate him.

### U.S. Fleet Commander on Way to Hankou: Short Stop in Nanjing and Jiujiang, Expected to Arrive in Hankou on the 21st, Returning to Shanghai Around the 26th

The North China Daily News reports that Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, departed from Shanghai yesterday morning (the 15th) on his fast ship, the Isabel, to Hankou. The U.S. ship Guam also went along. It is heard that it will replace the U.S. ship Oahu and be stationed in Hankou. According to the current plan, the Isabel will stop in Nanjing, Jiujiang, or other ports on this trip and is expected to arrive in Hankou on April 21st and return to Shanghai on April 26th. The Oahu will sail down with the Isabel at the same time. In addition, the French gunboat D'Iberville also left Shanghai yesterday morning for Hong Kong. It is reported that when the newly appointed French Ambassador to China, Cosme, came to Shanghai on the General Joffre, the ship collided with the Guangzhou in Hong Kong and had to transfer to the gunboat D'Iberville to Shanghai. Furthermore, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy claimed yesterday when receiving reporters from various newspapers that the U.S. ship Isabel and Guam are now preceded by a Japanese ship. According to the Japanese authorities, the ships are expected to arrive in Nanjing on Tuesday, Jiujiang on Wednesday, and anchor downstream of Hankou on the evening of April 20, and arrive in Hankou the next morning. Admiral Yarnell may land in Anqing and Jiujiang for a visit.

### The Great Cause of Father Yacquinot (1)

— Zhao Erqian

I remember a certain reporter once said: "The two wars of Hongge'ertu and Bailingmiao are only the prelude to our national liberation war." He also said: "The center of Hongcun (referring to Hongge'ertu) is the Catholic Church." The so-called "center" here has two meanings: in terms of the location of the whole village, the Catholic Church is in the center of the village, and the social, economic, cultural, and even political and military center of this village is also in the Catholic Church. The development of Catholicism in the border provinces has achieved amazing results. Taking Sui East as an example, the real force that dominates society is not the government but the church. The parish of the church is more effective than the political area of the county government. The development of the church is not mainly to persuade people with religious ideas: but to stand in front of the generally helpless poor people with the power of the church and the clergy, and handle the necessary work of life such as production, education, self-defense, medicine, elderly care, and childcare for them.

Indeed, Catholicism has made considerable contributions to this war. On the battlefields of the north, south, east, and west, the priests and parishioners of the Catholic Church have all made enthusiastic sacrifices and amazing stories that can truly move the heavens and weep the gods. Some have become martyrs on the battlefield, and some have worked in the rear. Not to mention the distant ones, just take Shanghai as an example, the famous Father Yacquinot is enough to attract people's attention. Last July, he returned from fundraising in the Americas and passed through Japan, where his short stay at the Fujita family resulted in the mystery of his disappearance, which caused much concern among people. Various newspapers carried this news, and for a time, almost all the attention on the isolated island was focused on Yacquinot. The reason why he can win people's sympathy and hold the public's attention and breath is because he is a priest, a humanitarian, and he practices his spirit of "love others as yourself." Everyone calls him the father of refugees, the friend of China, and foreigners call the Nanshi refugee area he founded "Yacquinot Zone", using his last name to print a stamp on his tragically managed career for future generations to remember.

On the French Concession in Shanghai, some roads are called Father Jin, Father Lao, and Father Du roads. Although Father Yacquinot's three characters cannot be said to be household names, they are well-known. In people's minds, they are as familiar as those road names. The priest is French and has two names. His real name is Yacquinot de Besange, and his Chinese name is Rao Jiaju, which is completely Chinese, just like the names of Ma Xiangbo and Mei Lanfang, which are reasonable and not jarring at all. This is the style of modern Catholic priests. When they come to China, they first ask a well-informed person to give them a name, then wear long robes, pick up chopsticks to eat, read Chinese books, speak Chinese, and run to the countryside to mingle with the people to preach. Father Yacquinot has also undergone this kind of training and life; and he is an outstanding one. In his French last name, because there is a small "de" character, it has caused many speculations that he is either a duke or a count, in short, he comes from a famous family and is a noble descendant. I think there is no need to say this, Father Yacquinot is detached from the world, and he does humanitarian work in the spirit of religion, which is precisely the nobility of his personality, just like the thoughts of Plato surpassing (The Divine Ploto), which makes people eternally admire and respect. The perfection of thought and personality is the crystallization of personal effort, and it seems that it has nothing to do with the great-great-grandfather, so there is no need to bother to investigate his family tree.

The Society of Jesus (The Societ.v of Jesus) is the most powerful and international organization in the Catholic Church. Its members are all over the world, and most of them are talented and skilled. At the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, members had already come to China, such as Francis Xavier, Matteo Ricci, Ferdinand Verbiest, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, and Giuseppe Castiglione. Not only were they loyal to their work and strived to preach, but also introduced specialized academics such as geography, astronomy, mathematics, physics, and metaphysics to China. The eastward spread of Western learning is its origin. The members of the Society of Jesus cannot be said to have made no contribution. Now, the cultural and charitable undertakings in Shanghai, such as the library and observatory in Xujiahui, the orphanage, Xuhui College, Aurora University in Lujiawan, and the observatory on Sheshan Mountain, were all initiated by the members of the Society of Jesus, and they continue to benefit the people today.

The Rao Jiaju we are talking about is also one of the members of the Society of Jesus. Before coming to China, he stayed in England for a long time and studied literature. Then, in 1913, he came to China to preach and taught English at Xuhui College and Aurora University. Students were afraid to attend his class, but no one disliked him because he treated people with sincerity and became a close friend of young people. He used to live in the second dormitory of Aurora University, and later moved to the Catholic Church on Luban Road, spending almost 20 years between teaching and preaching, speaking until his tongue was dry and his lips were parched, tirelessly teaching people. When the January 28th (1932) Shanghai War came, refugees in Hongkou were in urgent need of rescue, and a person who was impartial, universally respected, and valued by both sides (China and Japan) without causing international problems was needed to take on this difficult task, and of course, it was none other than Father Yacquinot.

Father Yacquinot is a social worker full of enthusiasm and active. He once said to the students of Aurora University: "People who do social work should be more active, more sociable, study psychology more, and know more friends, because society is a group of people, and people who serve in it must thoroughly understand it, otherwise they will not succeed, and there is no hope of completing the cause." He is also proficient in English, French, Chinese, Greek, Latin and other languages, and is a great orator. (To be continued)

Sexual Hygiene

### Neurasthenia and Kidney Deficiency: Sexual Impulses Should Be Suppressed

— Written by Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Faculty of Medicine of the Russian Labor University

According to daily experience, it is known that among the various organs and impulses of the human body, those that are absolutely controlled by the nerves and mind are probably none more than the sexual system. Ordinary functions and impulses, such as hunger, thirst, sleep, digestion, and breathing, are only partially controlled by the mind. When encountering fright, anxiety, sadness, etc., although the function of a certain organ can be temporarily suspended, it cannot be controlled for a long time, let alone permanently blocked. However, the sexual impulse is not like this. With spirit and mind, it can not only be subdued for several months or years, but also be made to lie dormant indefinitely. For example, when a person's full mind and spirit are concentrated on thinking or physical work, or the ability or attention is focused on his interesting industry, the idea of ​​absurdity and debauchery cannot enter his heart, and the evil and romantic sights and sounds cannot disturb his mind. Only when a person's mind is lazy and his physical strength is useless, the idea of ​​delusion will enter and dominate, and that person is in danger. Try to analyze the environment and the inducement of falling into crime of one hundred young people who are looking for flowers and willows and are addicted to brothels, and you can get ninety-nine people who are victims of the environment and temptation. It is definitely not after careful consideration that they are deliberately evil and lewd. The most common inducements, such as eating plenty of rich food and irritating food, can heat the blood and dim the wisdom, and indulging in wine and alcohol can make the lustful people crazy. Uncontrolled drinking gradually weakens people's intelligence, restraint, and decisiveness. Vulgar jokes and obscene stories are more than enough to spoil people's perceptions. Sensual dances, obscene films, and coercion from bad friends, etc., are all enough to make lustful people like a small boat off the anchor, drifting in the storm, and finally people can only helplessly go to the countryside.

If a person is overly indulgent in lust, he can often weaken his energy. For example, people who masturbate excessively or those who indulge in lust without restraint not only suffer from mental decline, but also spinal nerves and sexual function must have hundreds of diseases. Therefore, they often suffer from back pain, kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, and other symptoms. Once these diseases have been contracted, when treating them, one should clear the heart and reduce desires, and all languages and texts that are enough to cause sexual impulses must be kept away. Then, actively take the German animal testicular essence preparation for men, "Body-Con," which can show very effective results. "Body-Con" is made by extracting the testicular essence of calves, stags, orangutans, goats, and sea dogs, and has the three major effects of nourishing the brain, kidneys, and blood. I have used this agent to treat premature ejaculation, impotence, neurasthenia and other diseases for seven years, and have never encountered a failed case. Therefore, the agent has been praised by countless Chinese and foreign doctors and is happy to introduce it to patients. Its female "Body-Con" functions to regulate menstruation and seed production.

### The Seriousness of Coughs

— Doctor Sheng Zaigiang

Coughs are most easily overlooked. The reason is that cough sufferers do not seem to exhibit any immediately dangerous symptoms, so the condition is allowed to drag on, and the cough becomes increasingly severe, ultimately becoming incurable.

From a true pathological perspective, a cough is the lungs' way of expelling harmful external agents, and it is a form of resistance against intrusion. Using anesthetics would only reduce resistance. Based on my experience of over twenty years, and with reference to reports from medical experts in various countries, the most effective medicine for lung ailments is "Pulmonal," invented by German Dr. Tume. No matter how stubborn or difficult to cure, or how close the cough is to becoming consumption, taking "Pulmonal" can relieve coughing and dissolve phlegm within three hours. It is superior to cod liver oil in its ability to nourish the lungs and prevent consumption, as proven by medical experts in various countries.

### Nocturnal Emission from Masturbation and Incomplete Development

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

After masturbation becomes a habit, the frequency of nocturnal emissions gradually increases, causing continuous loss of essence and blood, which leads to neurasthenia, brain weakness, memory loss, and lower back pain. It can even hinder development, leading to incomplete development. Therefore, young men who suffer from nocturnal emissions caused by masturbation should seek active treatment. To cure nocturnal emissions, the bad habit of masturbation must be stopped. Taking "Nair-Es Spermatorrhea Pills" can cure it completely. If neurasthenia and other symptoms of weakness, incomplete development, premature ejaculation, or impotence have already resulted from spermatorrhea, taking "Butiren" will invariably bring about a cure. Below is a case to prove this.

Patient Yan Zhengkang, from Kunming, is 22 years old and a student. (Self-reported) My body is weak, my development is incomplete, my brain is weak, my memory is poor, and my studies are declining. (Source of the illness) I was poisoned by obscene books, leading to excessive masturbation and indulgence, resulting in symptoms of weakness such as incomplete development. (Treatment process) I was given "Nair-Es Spermatorrhea Pills" to treat the spermatorrhea, and then "Butiren" to nourish my essence and brain. After taking several bottles, the spermatorrhea stopped early, and I immediately felt that my essence was sufficient and my brain was refreshed. My energy was restored, my complexion became rosy, and my weight increased. It was like being reborn.

### ### Seeking Pleasure: A Dangerous Game

— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

Gonorrhea is often contracted from casual moments of pleasure, which are usually found in places where people seek fleeting enjoyment, such as brothels. Therefore, the price of such pleasure is not only money but also suffering. This is truly the most expensive game. Everyone knows it's a dangerous game, yet they still flock to it. This is why gonorrhea is becoming increasingly rampant, and effective treatment is necessary.

Regarding the methods of treating gonorrhea, opinions vary. However, after careful consideration, many are difficult for us clinicians to believe. Based on my many years of experience, the only medicine that deserves praise for treating gonorrhea is "Klinon," invented by German Dr. Peter, which is recognized worldwide. I have used it for acute and chronic gonorrhea, as well as various secondary and concurrent symptoms, and it has always been effective. Therefore, "Klinon" has become the first guarantee of a radical cure for gonorrhea patients. This has not only been proven by me personally but also by people internationally. I hereby excerpt the experimental report of Dr. McGary, Director of the Cornell Venereal Disease Hospital in the United States, as follows:

Patient John Gay, 30 years old, is the son of a wealthy merchant. He has suffered from gonorrhea for six or seven years, and the concurrent symptoms he has suffered from include prostatitis, arthritis, and orchitis. He has endured various types of suffering and has tried every new medicine that comes out each year, but the gonorrhea has only penetrated deeper. He then entered the Cornell Venereal Disease Hospital that I established for treatment. After I used complete diagnostic methods to detect his condition, I learned that the gonorrhea had spread throughout his bloodstream. It was difficult to achieve success with partial chemical therapy and membrane-penetrating sterilization therapy. Therefore, I used "Klinon" as an oral medication, and externally, I used "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" according to the instructions and diagrams, instructing him to treat himself at home. As a result, within two weeks, his symptoms were greatly reduced. His joints were able to move freely again, and the swelling of his prostate and testicles had subsided. He continued treatment for five weeks and was completely cured, and has not relapsed since.

### ### Discussing the Recurrence of Chronic Gonorrhea

— Written by Doctor Yao Juyan

Clinic: Corner of 9 Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road

Once gonorrheal urethritis becomes chronic, people often ignore their own symptoms because the pain is gone, so they don't pay attention and act recklessly (such as engaging in sexual activity, drinking alcohol, or overworking). As a result, not only do the symptoms of urethritis worsen, but the gonorrhea also takes the opportunity to further invade and cause secondary urethritis and prostatitis.

Even more common is that patients who have had chronic urethritis take some powerful medicine or temporarily adhere to health regimens, causing the gonorrhea to become dormant and subside. They then mistakenly believe that their old illness has been cured and no longer fear the consequences, indulging in promiscuous sexual activity. The latent gonorrhea is stimulated by this and reawakens, and then runs rampant. In severe cases, it flares up immediately; in delayed cases, it will inevitably appear within a day or two. Some even forget that they have had this old illness and become angry at the other party, thinking that the other party is unclean and has transmitted the disease to them. Isn't this unfair? I have encountered this many times and will relate one example here. A year ago, a man named Xing Wangyun came to me for treatment. Xing was the son of a wealthy family and often frequented brothels, resulting in him contracting gonorrhea. Because he greedily took powerful medicine and reluctantly temporarily refrained from lewd pursuits, the gonorrhea on the surface temporarily ceased activity and seemed to have been cured. Not long after, he married a woman, and within three days, the gonorrhea recurred. He suspected his wife of infidelity and was quite resentful, not knowing that his wife was actually harmed by him. He invited several doctors to examine her, but they could not determine the cause. After my diagnosis, it was confirmed to be a recurrence of the old illness. I prescribed the gonorrhea miracle drug "Klinon," along with German electrostatic therapy and surgery to correct the condition. His wife also took "Klinon" and used "Karol-Schädlich Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories externally. As a result, the gonorrhea of both Xing and his wife was completely cured within four weeks. They have lived together ever since and have not relapsed, and their marital love is as harmonious as ever. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Twenty appointment numbers issued daily, each number costs only five cents.

### The Yang Zaisan Assassination Attempt: Trial Continues This Morning

Rumor has it that Yang's son and father, seeking favor with a certain party, willingly became traitors and sold out Xiong Jiandong.

Yang Zaisan, an elderly man from Changshu, nearly sixty years old, was temporarily residing at the Dahu Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. On the 5th of this month, at noon, he went out with a friend and had lunch at the nearby Juxing Restaurant. As he and his friend were walking back to the Dahu Hotel, he was suddenly assassinated by a burly man from Siyang named Xu Zichou. The

bullet jammed in the chamber and did not fire, so Yang was not harmed. Subsequently, detectives and police officers arrived after hearing the alert and pursued and captured Xu Zimao, who had fired the gun. He was taken back to the police station, sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation, and remanded in custody for further investigation and questioning. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, according to people from Changshu who are familiar with the matter, Yang has considerable potential influence in the western countryside of Changshu. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Resistance War, Yang was unable to live peacefully in his hometown due to its fall to the enemy and the rise of bandits. He fled to Shanghai with his family.

Yang's son, Yang Xingfang, is over thirty years old. After the fall of his hometown, he gathered local patriotic youths to organize a guerrilla force. Many young men and strong laborers from the surrounding countryside came in response. Yang Xingfang appointed himself commander-in-chief and was under the command of Xiong Jiandong, commander of the guerrilla forces of six counties: Changshu, Kunshan, Jiading, Qingpu, Taicang, and Baoshan. He engaged in many attacks and skirmishes with the enemy. This spring, Yang Xingfang suddenly had a falling out with Xiong Jiandong due to some matter and immediately defected and surrendered to the enemy,

willingly becoming a traitor. The enemy appointed Yang Xingfang as the "剿匪 Commander" of Changshu, ordering his father, Yang Zaisan, to be in Shanghai to liaise with the enemy, luring Xiong Jiandong to Shanghai to be detained by the enemy. There was once a rumor that Xiong had been killed, causing a great uproar among Xiong's subordinates, leading to the shooting of Yang Zaisan in Shanghai. As for the previous report that Xiong Guisong, a man from Hubei who served as the third detachment commander under Yang Xingfang, was lost at the age of eight and raised by Yang Zaisan, who treated him like his own son, arranged his marriage, and had children with him.

He was entrusted with important responsibilities by Xingfang, hoping that Xiong would repay his kindness, but ultimately he repaid kindness with hatred. Those who came to inquire said they did not know the details and did not know who this Xiong was. The French police department, based on the regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the concession, summoned the plaintiff for detailed investigation. The Second Special Court is scheduled to hold a hearing on this case at 10:00 AM today to determine whether it is an ordinary feud or involves political relations. The truth will be revealed at that time to clear up people's doubts.

### Japanese Military Police Arrest Chinese Constable in Route Tenant de Bienville

Constable suspected of colluding with terrorists; Assistant Commissioner of Police in charge of investigation.

According to the Continental News, yesterday (the 15th), the Japanese-language Continental New Report stated that Major Hayashi, the chief of the political section of the Japanese military police, issued a warning to the Shanghai Municipal Police Department of the Public Concession that its armed and uniformed police personnel were entering the area of the Kunlian Border Road without any legal reason on Thursday. This was due to the arrest of Chinese constable No. 3088, surnamed Li, by the Japanese military police in an alley next to Route Tenant de Bienville on Wednesday morning around 9:00 AM. After detaining the Chinese constable, the Japanese military police also arrested seventeen Chinese people, suspected of being terrorists who attacked the Wujiaochang area of Route Tenant de Bienville on Wednesday morning. Before the arrest of the Chinese suspects, they engaged in fierce gunfire with the Japanese search team, with both sides firing over thirty shots. One of the arrested Chinese people was injured in the thigh. Six of them have admitted to being members of the Iron-Blooded Anti-Traitor Corps. The report also stated that when the Japanese military police were paying attention to the hiding place of the terrorists, they saw the Chinese constable Li lingering nearby and suspected that he was colluding with the terrorists, so they arrested him and押押to the Western District Japanese Military Police Headquarters for questioning. After questioning, it was clarified that he was not related to the terrorists. However, the Chinese constable admitted that he was waiting for a Chinese person to give him a monthly "protection fee" of five yuan for a secret opium den in the area. Subsequently, a Japanese police officer from the police department, accompanied by a European police officer, went to retrieve the Chinese constable. Mr. Newhook, the assistant commissioner of police of the police department, is currently responsible for investigating the incident involving the Chinese constable.

According to the French-language Shanghai Daily on the 16th, according to Japanese sources, the Political Department of the Japanese Military Police recently notified the Public Concession Police Station, instructing it to strictly order its subordinate police officers not to "intrude" into the Chinese area. According to the Japanese-language Continental New Report, a Chinese constable of the Public Concession, with the number 3088 and 37 years old, was detained by Japanese soldiers next to Route Tenant de Bienville for accidentally entering the Chinese area. As for the reason for his detention, on the morning of Wednesday (the 12th), when the Japanese army arrested the guerrillas there, they suddenly saw a Chinese constable nearby and suspected that he was an accomplice of the Chinese army, so they arrested him. After questioning, he was released after it was clarified that he was not involved.

### Abduction of a Girl: Sentencing Set for the 20th

Li Aihua, the thirteen-year-old daughter of Li Zuoheng, a Cantonese shareholder of the Ouyayuan Cantonese midnight snack shop at 339 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, was studying at the Dongxin Primary School in Shiyuli. On January 5th of this year, she was abducted from the school and taken to the Songjiang countryside, where she was sold to the Hong family there. Later, because guerrillas attacked the Japanese army in the area, the Hong family fled, abandoning Aihua in the house and leaving her unattended. Subsequently, neighbors of the Hong family learned that the girl had been abducted and brought there. The neighbors took the girl to Shanghai by boat. When the boat arrived at the dock, they told the girl to go ashore and go home by herself. The girl got lost and was driven by hunger and cold to cry beside the iron gate at the entrance of the Dongnanli alley on Dagu Road in the French Concession. She was taken in by a police officer surnamed Li at his home. On the 23rd of last month, the police officer's wife, Li Zhou, took the girl to visit relatives at No. 1 Annakin Apartments on Avenue Annakin. The girl was playing with a child at the entrance of Annakin Apartments when she was spotted by a friend of her father who was passing by. He notified the girl's father and reported it to the French police station, who brought the girl to the station. After questioning, it was learned that she was first abducted to the home of a fellow villager, a woman surnamed Li Wu, at No. 29 Taihuali on North Jiangxi Road. After drinking a cup of boiled water, she became dazed and confused. She was then taken to Songjiang and sold to someone. She also recounted her return to Shanghai. Since Li Wu was suspected of being involved in the abduction, she was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. The other day, Judge Liao held a continued hearing. The French Concession authorities prosecuted her for the crime of disrupting the family. The victim, Li Aihua, also appeared in court to give a detailed account of the abduction. When questioned, Li Wu denied knowing anything and claimed to have been framed. She also hired lawyer Deng Jiabing to defend her. The court ordered the announcement of the conclusion of the hearing and set sentencing for the 20th. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### Elder Brother Sues Younger Brother for Embezzlement: Younger Brother's Wife Faints Again

The police officers gave emergency treatment and she gradually woke up. The elder brother did not pursue the matter and withdrew the lawsuit.

Fang Qixian, a shareholder and manager of the Mei Hua Printing Factory on North Zhejiang Road, 海門人, previously imprisoned his younger brother Qichang for disregarding his wife's wishes and independently advocating for borrowing a large sum of money to marry a nineteen-year-old woman named Zhang Cailing. Under the repeated slander of his wife, he dismissed his younger brother from his job as a traveling salesman at the factory, leaving Qichang with no way to make a living. He then falsely claimed that someone from the outside had learned that the silk in the factory

was Japanese goods and was going to inspect the factory and should be quickly moved and hidden. He then hired two Xiang Sheng taxis and drove to the factory, taking away sixty-seven bolts of silk worth 1,500 yuan, which he was selling. Qixian reported this to the Hui Si police station, who sent detectives to arrest Fang Qichang and Zhang Cailing, took out the stolen goods, and sent them to the First Special District Local Court for investigation. Zhang fainted in court that day, and Fang Qixian did not appear in court. The court ruled that Fang Qichang should be remanded in custody, Zhang should be released on bail, and the date should be changed for summoning Fang Qixian to appear in court for questioning. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. The day before yesterday was the date for the

continued hearing of the case. The defendant, Fang Qichang, was brought to court under police escort. His wife, Zhang Cailing, surrendered herself to the court. The plaintiff, Fang Qixian, also rushed to the court in compliance with the summons. However, Zhang Cailing, after sitting in the eighth criminal court for only a moment, suddenly repeated her previous fainting spell during the first trial. The police officers in the court then administered artificial resuscitation, with some spraying warm water on the woman's face and others massaging her chest. Until Fang Qixian declared to the court that he did not want to pursue the matter and begged for

withdrawal of the lawsuit, and Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer of the police station, declared that the police station had no objection to Fang's accusation. Then, after Magistrate Fang Qinghuan ruled that the case would not be accepted, the woman's pale face gradually disappeared and she regained consciousness. She was then helped away by a middle-aged woman. The two transformations of the beauty all started at the beginning of the trial, not before or after. This is an unprecedented image.

### Puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan: Strict Security Measures

Employs three look-alikes as decoys and prepares three identical cars to confuse the vision.

Due to the recent resurgence of patriotic assassins carrying out their work, the puppet "Mayor" of Shanghai, Chuan Xiaoan, has long been fearful of sharing the same fate as his predecessors. In addition to tightening security around the puppet government to prevent any eventuality, reporters learned from reliable sources yesterday that Chuan's latest security measures are even stricter. All personnel in the puppet government must be recommended by extremely reliable sources before being hired. Even the bodyguards and servants employed at Chuan's residence are not easily hired without a thorough investigation. Recently, Chuan has also found three look-alikes with the same face as Chuan and prepared three identical cars to accompany him when he travels, in order to confuse outsiders' vision. Every night, Chuan waits until after 1:00 AM, when everyone is asleep, before quietly returning home, which must be a miserable life for someone.

### Seeking Zhang Zhu Caiwen

Suffering from mental illness

There is a woman from Pudong named Zhang Zhu (also known as Caiwen), who is in her thirties and has two sons. Her husband, Zhang Yunchun, works in the Shandong Post Office. Zhang's mother, Liu, had a mental illness. She had an attack in the past and drowned in a river. Her brother, Ruiqi, also died of a mental illness. Doctors believe that this is due to heredity. Eight or nine years ago, Ms. Zhang had an attack after giving birth to a child. Her husband sent her back to her hometown. She was admitted to the psychiatric department of the Puyu Hall in the Nanshi area for treatment but was not cured. Later, she was treated by Dr. Sun Lifu, but she did not fully recover. In mid-March of this year, that is, after the Lantern Festival, she suddenly went out and did not return. At first, her family did not pay much attention because she often went out. Recently, her family has been deeply alarmed by her long absence and has been searching everywhere, but she has not been found yet. Her family members believe that she once wandered into the guerrilla headquarters in Hangtou Town last year, speaking incoherently. Someone recognized her as the daughter of Zhu and knew that she had a mental illness, so they released her. The Pudong area is now unstable. It is not known whether she has come to Shanghai. A reward is currently being offered to find her in the hope of reuniting with her.

### Japanese Yamanoto of Taikang Yarn Factory Kidnapped by Guerrillas

Met guerrillas near Nanxiang and were taken along with the car to the guerrilla area.

The day before yesterday (the 14th), at around 11:00 AM, a Japanese man was captured by the Chinese guerrillas near Nanxiang. His life or death is still unknown. The Japanese side is sending out a garrison to search for him. The fact is that on the morning of that day, a Japanese man named Yamanoto (43 years old), the head of the catering department of the Taikang Yarn Factory, a Japanese company on Yangshupu Lanzhou Road in Hongkou, went to Jiading to purchase rice. He went there by car, driven by a Chinese man named Zhang Fengming. Unexpectedly, when Yamanoto was returning to Shanghai after buying rice, a small team of Chinese guerrillas, about sixteen or seventeen people, who were searching in the area, caught sight of the car and stopped it from moving forward, firing a warning shot. They detained the car and ordered Zhang to drive the car to the guerrilla area. Afterwards, the Japanese side learned of this and sent a team to search for him, but there has been no news of him yet.

### Letter

To the Editor, Yesterday I read a news report about "Someone Sending a Warning Letter to Pig Merchants." The wording involving me is obviously not true. (1) I published advertisements in the Shen Xin newspapers on March 27th and 28th, "Changshun Pig Bank Statement on Trademark Shadowing," which can be consulted. (2) I, the manager of Changshun Pig Bank, have always been law-abiding and have joined the industry oath and joint declaration, declaring my position and unwavering commitment. (3) I and my bank have always operated in Nanshi and Wusong. After August 13th, we moved into the French Concession Industry Market. The statement that we have always operated in Hongkou is even more slanderous. Moreover, the report contains many errors in my name, which further proves that what I have heard is untrue. I dare to guarantee to the public with my personality that my will is firm and I will never participate in illegal organizations. I hereby declare this and request a correction. To the Editor of Your Newspaper, Gu Baoxiang, April 28th, 16th Year

### Emphasizing Annihilation Warfare

— Mao Lie

These past few days have been filled with news of recovered territories, truly inspiring and encouraging. There is an exceptional sense of optimism about the victory of the war of resistance. However, we already know that this is not a general counter-offensive, but rather another form of attrition warfare. The advent of a general counter-offensive will undoubtedly be much more massive in scale and its pace and scope of recovery will certainly far exceed the present. Now, I would say that this is a counter-offensive based on opportunity, aimed at further attrition, depleting the enemy's manpower. In other words, this is annihilation warfare.

Previously, we merely advanced step by step, defending section by section, with the aim of depleting the enemy's manpower and resources. Therefore, when the enemy attacked, we fought back; when the enemy did not attack, we remained stationary. This situation seemed as if we were being beaten without retaliating. While the goal of attrition was indeed achieved, the power of initiative remained in the enemy's hands. As a result, when they did not come, we had nothing to deplete, and what we did deplete of theirs was mostly limited to resources, while overlooking manpower. Resources are easily replenished, but manpower is irreplaceable. We only achieved a small part of our attrition goal.

Now, we are launching counter-offensives based on opportunity. "Based on opportunity" means targeting the enemy's weaknesses, attacking where it suits us. It is best if we can recover territory, but it does not matter if we cannot recover it or cannot hold it even after recovering it, because we have already achieved our goal of depleting the enemy anyway. However, in this attrition through counter-offensives based on opportunity, I hope that our military authorities will pay special attention to the depletion of enemy manpower. In other words, we must emphasize annihilation warfare.

Manpower is, after all, the root of combat power; even with just flesh and blood, a new Great Wall can be built. We have plenty of manpower, while the enemy's greatest shortage is manpower. We far surpass them in this aspect, with a ratio of seven to one. Their total troop strength is only six million, and over one and a half million have already come to China, with six or seven hundred thousand already lost. If we focus on continuously striking them in this area, I believe it will be the enemy's true fatal wound.

What I have been paying attention to in the newspapers is the number of enemy deaths in each battle; the gain or loss of a place is still uncertain. I believe that as long as we continue to fight and continue to annihilate them, I will remain fully optimistic, even if we occasionally lose territory, let alone occasionally recover it. And the current counter-offensives based on opportunity can better achieve this goal of annihilating the enemy because if they are afraid of us and do not come to their deaths, we can attack them and annihilate them one by one, unlike before when we could only watch them leisurely outside our fire line.

### Spring Plowing

— Zhang Zhenshan

The spring breeze sweeps across the earth, easing the stiffness of the harsh winter; everything withered has revived. New buds sprout at the tips of branches, and tender green specks are embedded in the field paths. That warm, humid breath spreads throughout the countryside.

The plowing oxen, with their two sharp horns, move their heavy steps, plowing through the fields; the mud stirred up resembles the waves stirred up by small ships in rivers.

In April, there is no idle person in the countryside. The garrison troops issued an order to assist with plowing.

A squad of brothers walked out of the dilapidated temple, looked at the farmers and plowing oxen bathed in the spring sun, and a layer of joy pressed on their hearts. They released their gun handles and picked up plows and hoes; a smile floated on the squad leader's face as well.

The scene on the rice paddies immediately changed: gray cloth military uniforms, bamboo hats, waving slender ox whips, and supporting plow handles to assist with plowing; the original farmers were instead left with free time.

Surprise flew onto their faces. A young farmer waved his hand, clenched his fist, and said warmly and humbly:

"Please rest. We shouldn't receive help from brothers who are contributing to the country, but rather we should help you."

Then, he gave a bamboo pipe to the old soldier; but he didn't know how to smoke, so he turned around and urged the plowing ox forward again.

The soft, melting spring breeze swept across the field, constantly broadcasting: a fresh and slightly damp fragrance. The vitality of life melted into nature, and a group of brothers were thus further excited. However, the loyal farmers stubbornly refused to be idle, and after yielding once, then twice, they finally said more firmly:

"You helped build the roads we should have built; you helped dig the trenches we should have dug; and now you're helping plow the fields we should plow. Rest, please. We really don't want you to do it for us—although the military and the people should cooperate."

"Yes, we're really sorry! Protecting the country, protecting us, and still..."

As another farmer interjected, the old soldier also burst into laughter and said, "The powerful driving force should now be entrusted to the countryside. Please don't underestimate yourselves. You will be evolving from sturdy men's self-defense training to guerrilla warfare. Your work is our work; our work is also your work. Haha..."

The laughter stopped, and the plowing oxen were also tired as time passed. The mud on the rice paddies was also spread evenly. Looking over, it looked like black velvet carpets. So, leading the plowing oxen, they walked onto the grassland, and a group of people sat around on the ground, and their fatigue disappeared into joyful laughter.

The golden rays of the setting sun went from soft to dim, and the twilight gradually thickened. At this time, a group of people lined up in a long row and embarked on their way home. On the peaceful field road, led by the old soldier, they unleashed a heroic song:

"Protect your own hometown, work your own fields. The war of resistance is for freedom; the war of resistance is for survival. Unite, advance! The people are the army, the army is the people, wave your guns and hoes to fight the enemy, the military and the people are of one heart!"

### Peace at the Mouth of the Cannon

### Smiles and Tears

— Ding Di

...Like frost-dried fallen leaves, disappearing into the spirals of the wind, the smiles faded from everyone's face. Without smiles, the skin inevitably spasms, unwilling to smile and unable to smile.

A light smile, blown away by the storm; a faint smile, hidden by dark clouds; a thin smile, pierced by bullets. Although every smile contains a story, happy, interesting, everyone has many stories, and there are still many smiles, but these stories are finally stolen. Placed in dense velvet, cherished, careful, treasured, it is still inevitable to break through the barrier, seize the key, break into the box, and empty the bag. The empty brocade box, looking around blankly, the happy, interesting stories, leave no memory behind. Without the surplus of laughter, sour and salty ice pillars drip down.

Cowardly people say: "Our smiles are gone forever. The happy, interesting stories have been stolen clean. What joy can we have?"

They are often a group of gray people, deeply sad, their faces covered in tears. Smiles are lost and stories are forgotten, and they are immersed in tears all day long. Every tear often has a story. Everyone has many stories, sad, painful stories that cannot be forgotten, so tears fall. Replacing the stories of the past, the smiles of the past, tears fall into the brocade box.

It's not a nightmare. Although the brocade box hasn't changed, try groping it with your hand: you will find that your hands have been soaked by tears. So many stories gnawing at the heart are like poisonous snakes. These are not happy, interesting stories. The memories of sorrow and pain have been shed into thin cicada shells. Surrounded by cicada shells, people shed tears. Ask the cicada shells for laughter again, and they don't know and have no way to know.

Losing the smiles of the past, everyone's face is draped with a "melancholy". When the plunder of the invaders has not been recovered, they are unwilling to smile and unable to smile. Cowardly people are accustomed to sorrow, immersed in the deep pool of tears all day long, corroded, weak, tired, and timid. "Aren't you going to retrieve the laughter of the past?" When tears strip the cowardly of their weakness, I can't help but call out loudly.

Pain grinds us, everyone has many unfortunate stories, stories that make people shed tears. It's not the claws of the invaders, what shameless idiot would be willing to force a smile?

The cowardly tell me: "Laughter is gone, you can only wash your face with tears from now on."

The stubborn me, however, retorted with merciless ridicule. I replied: "I am unwilling to force a smile because I am not the claw of an invader, but to tell you the truth, I am tired of washing my face with tears. Why don't you retrieve the laughter of the past, from the hands of the invaders?"

Living silently in tears only depletes the power of battle. I don't want to be too happy, and I don't want to be too sad.

It's not that there are no smiles: those who willingly kill themselves laugh because of stupidity. Those who eat their own kind laugh because of barbarism, those who flatter bandits and take them as fathers laugh because of ignorance, and those who are dressed like monkeys laugh because of baseness and filth.

We say: These are smiles, what about tears?

We are indignant at their shamelessness, can we not pity their ignorance?

"It's not a time for laughter." So the worriers are startled and vigilant. They "lament" the past that has disappeared all day long. They do not "seek" laughter.

I don't want to be shameless, and I don't want to be a worrier.

I have many unfortunate stories, and I cannot avoid sorrow. Like many people: smiles are lost, and what is left is tears. Without smiles, unwilling to smile and unable to smile. However, I am also unwilling to let the tears in the box flow forever, making me a laughingstock for the invaders, and also corroding my own strength. I suppressed my sorrow. My tears, unwilling to flow and unable to flow.

I seek laughter. Not from the past, the past often leads to "nostalgia", not from today, today easily becomes "shameless", I often entrust laughter to the near future. This is the time for true laughter, this is the time to refine laughter with tears.

It is necessary to seize what we had from the hands of the invaders. I forge my emotions to be as iron: neither laughing nor crying.

### Learning to Be Mature

— Geng Zhi

It seems that there is such a saying in society: "Mature" is another name for "useless." Since society has come to admire flowery words, cunning and hypocrisy, mature people have all been eliminated, leaving them with no place to stand in life and no place to be buried in death. Therefore, everyone regards them as "idiots," "stubborn," "suckers," "dupes"—in a word, as useless people, whom everyone deeply hates and detests. As a result, everyone is afraid of being called "mature" by others and often mocks others as being mature. It seems that the term "mature" will become an ominous term, and the quality of being mature will become a bad quality.

However, the fact is that there is another group of people in society who are desperately advocating maturity. What exactly is going on?

Some elderly fathers, elder brothers, or teachers will say to younger siblings or students that young people must be mature. A young person who is mature will surely become great in the future. The most unacceptable thing is to talk about love all the time, and for men and women to go out together on the street, or sit together in public: behavior is frivolous and indecent. What they say is of course correct, because for them, matters between men and women are at most things they do secretly, climbing over the neighbor's wall to "embrace his daughter," which others cannot see and does not harm their maturity. They will also say that the relationship between husband and wife is one of the five cardinal relationships, how important it is, but young people's blood is unsettled, and they talk about divorce at the drop of a hat. What they say is of course also correct, because they have their own mature method: "Of the three unfilial acts, the greatest is to have no descendants"—taking a concubine. Even a beggar from Qi had a wife and a concubine, as seen in Mencius; taking a concubine is, without a doubt, a mature behavior.

Some wealthy bosses, compradors, or chiefs or managers will lecture younger employees: young people must be mature; if they are mature, they can gain the trust of the boss or superiors, and will have great prospects in the future. Under the pressure of obedience, the young employees naturally want to do their best to be mature, to exhaust the capabilities of maturity, and to die without regret. Fortunately, these superiors are superior, and these young employees mostly do not know why. They only see them wearing long gowns and mandarin jackets, behaving in a proper manner, truly very mature. But they have no way of participating in the secret affairs of stealing the sky and changing the sun, and embezzling public funds for private gain, and all kinds of super-mature behaviors.

In addition, there are many other people who claim to be mature themselves and advise others to be mature. Even rickshaw pullers will say to you when bargaining, "Regular price, two jiao (cents) of silver." Being "regular," isn't that maturity?

However, this kind of persuasion to learn maturity is, after all, not very effective, because the speaker is earnest, but the listener is indifferent, which has already become the norm. If the speaker's careful planning and fine words and deeds were once thoroughly understood by the listener, just like seeing the liver and lungs, then they would mislead all those who learn to be mature. Only those young people who are willing to learn maturity themselves can their learning be deeply rooted and become great talents.

I often see many young people walking with square steps, fearing to step on ants; when they sit down, they bend their waists and backs, bowing as if they were greeting someone; the sound of coughing and spitting is constant in their throats and from their mouths, spreading dense and light pearls everywhere in the wind; a cigarette in hand, never leaving their grasp, but never actually going into their mouths, so their fingers are yellowed, and they are qualified to be old; either wearing Western clothes, there must be a button missing, and their trouser legs hang up to their shins, so you could easily knock on them with a cane; or wearing Chinese clothes, they must love its original color, and must change its original shape, saying that famous scholars do not care about their appearance; when talking or writing to people, they address those older than them, such as their grandparents, fathers, or teachers, as brothers, because they know that Confucius studied with Xiang Tuo, and Gan Luo became Prime Minister at twelve, because it is said that there is a sequence to learning and specialization in studies, which has nothing to do with age; being skilled at thresholds, calling themselves old thresholds, being familiar with Shanghai, calling themselves old Shanghai; whenever they open their mouths or pick up a pen, it is always about something that happened several years ago, how I was then, and how I am now, reflecting on the past and feeling emotional; or whenever they open their mouths or pick up a pen, they teach people, as if they have a unique secret, which can be sold like a savage's head...

These young people are truly geniuses; what others learn to no avail by the age of forty or fifty, they can, between the ages of fifteen and thirty, learn as soon as they set their minds to it, and they can learn to be vivid and lifelike. Therefore, they become literary giants and writers in the cultural world; they become leaders and tycoons in the business world; in some other world, they become big shots, all-rounders, and people who can get things done... I respect and admire them the most. Once, when I was eating half a baby chicken, I used all my strength but couldn't chew it at all. Someone said that this chicken is a mature young person, so I respectfully and reverently pushed it aside, not daring, and especially not bearing, to eat it again.

So, who says that "mature" is another name for "useless"? We should learn it; whether passively or actively, it's all the same when it comes to success. Once they breathe their last, they can also earn the eulogy of "the withering of maturity," which would not bring glory to their resting place!

### Extra Thoughts

— Editor

This publication has never engaged in "pen wars" with other publications, and the editor personally dislikes this kind of thing, even more so. Therefore, this publication always tries to be careful with any text that could cause misunderstanding. As for those who are deliberately nitpicking, this publication will not participate. Unsolicited manuscripts that take up sides or counter attack, this publication will not include, please forgive us. The reason is very simple: this kind of "pen war" is only destructive, and it shouldn't happen normally, especially not during this time when the whole country is united in resistance against the Japanese. If there is free time, I hope everyone will write more constructive articles.

### The Aftermath of Refugees

— Baiqiang

After the establishment of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, an Aftermath Committee was set up, and there was also an Aftermath Department within the Secretariat. The former focuses on suggestions, while the latter is engaged in execution. But what is called aftermath? And what are the Aftermath Committee and the Aftermath Department doing? I think this is not only what the refugees in the various shelters hope to know, but also what people from all walks of life who care about the refugee issue may also want to know.

The so-called refugee aftermath is to help refugees become self-reliant and reduce the burden on society. In general, there are many refugees who are unwilling to be supported for a long time and are willing to seek their own way. These refugees originally had no home to return to in the shelters and had nothing to do. Due to the impact of the war, they had no choice but to be temporarily supported in the shelters. But their conscience, their ambition, will never be trapped like this for long! The Aftermath Department of the Association will also provide appropriate arrangements on this point, helping them open a bright path and find a suitable direction and destination in the future course of their lives. In this way, the refugee problem can be solved, and the stability of social order and the promotion of national construction can also be solved. The relationship between common interests and losses is actually very important. At present, the methods adopted by the Aftermath Committee and the Aftermath Department of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association include three types: First, for refugees who can leave Shanghai and go to relatives and friends, provide boat tickets, or travel expenses of two to twelve yuan. Second, for refugees with a skill, introduce suitable occupations to all walks of life based on their abilities and experience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, various trade associations, and industrial and commercial firms will enthusiastically support the promotion of refugees' livelihoods. Third, for refugees who cannot leave Shanghai and have no special skills and no occupation to introduce, plans will be made to train them. Various production undertakings will be run by the Association itself or jointly with industrial and commercial circles to accommodate them. In addition, special refugees, such as the disabled, the elderly, and orphans, will also be given special attention separately in the future. A vacant lot has now been designated on Dunxin Road, which is planned as the site of the orphanage in the future.

In short, all this aftermath work still requires a lot of help from society to have good results. May everyone work hard on the refugee aftermath.

### Talking about the Rescue Piggy Bank Movement

— Han Mei

Relief for refugees will not be effective without a long-term and sustained effort. Because the war has not ended, and the refugees in the war zone cannot return home safely. The Refugee Relief Association, in view of this, has been coordinating accommodation, support, education, and production since its establishment, and has achieved satisfactory results. All the living expenses of the refugees are also entirely dependent on the enthusiastic donations of people from all walks of life to continue their lives. Moreover, because the days are long and the funds are urgently needed, it is necessary to establish various fundraising methods to raise this amount of funds. We should express our sympathy for the various painstaking efforts of the organizers and give them enthusiastic support. Among these many fundraising methods, I most approve of the Rescue Piggy Bank Movement promoted by the fellow villagers' groups, because this kind of saving for rescue is easy, meaningful, and only requires the correct promotion method to sustain it for a long time, and there are no drawbacks. If each family, or each school or store, can receive one, and implement savings on a daily or monthly basis to help refugees, then one family is not much, but ten families are many. When collected together, it will be very considerable. Moreover, this method can arouse the interest of the general public and cultivate the habit of saving for disaster relief in every family. The so-called taking without hurting integrity is the most practical. Everyone deserves to advocate and practice it. If it can be persevered, it will be of great benefit to the disaster relief movement.

General Knowledge

### Reading the Newspaper (2)

— Tan Tian

Newspapers publish almost every day an article that criticizes current events. This kind of text is generally called an "editorial." The entire text inevitably represents the position and the ideology of the newspaper. Therefore, the true meaning of "editorial" is to give a fair criticism of the current problems and the evolution of facts, to provide a correct analysis, to arouse the public, to guide the public, and to supervise the government as a principle. Therefore, many editorials can now be unified under the slogan of resisting the enemy in unity. Even foreign merchants' newspapers can make righteous appeals from a sympathetic standpoint, which can be our reference. However, the names of editorials in many newspapers are now different. Some are labeled "Current Commentary," some are labeled "Commentary Forum," some are labeled "Editorial Commentary," and some are labeled "Commentary." All of these are alternative names for editorials. In addition, in the position of the editorial, sometimes an editorial is not published, but an outside contribution is published. This is called "External Commentary" or "Replacement Commentary," which means that the newspaper fully approves of that article. In short, it is also an editorial.

Public Opinion　One of the functions of newspapers is to form public opinion. This means that if the various news or opinions published in the newspaper can be approved by the majority of readers, then public opinion is formed. Public opinion is the combined opinion of the majority, and it is a reflection of social consciousness. It occurs naturally. Although modern countries often use the news censorship system to suppress public opinion and transform public opinion, public opinion will still occur when one of the following situations is encountered: 1. Government errors policies are pointed out by knowledgeable people; 2. Government oppression is too severe, and the oppressed resolutely resist; 3. The oppressed expand the united strength against the oppressors. In short, the power of public opinion is very powerful. As the saying goes, "If a thousand people point the finger at you, you will surely die." A person cannot last long if they are scolded everywhere.

Advertising　Advertising is a weapon in the commercial war in capitalist society. Merchants must use advertisements to call on people to buy their goods, and we don't need to explain this. Living in Shanghai is like living in an advertising nest. When walking on the road, you see advertisements. When living at home, you hear advertisements. Wherever there is a place that can attract attention, there are advertisements, and newspapers are the only medium for advertisements. Therefore, general people's weddings, funerals, statements, and apologies must use advertisements, and disaster relief, fundraising, acting, and train operation times also use advertisements. This is of course reasonable, but now there are many people who specialize in advertising and cause people to fall into the trap. Like drug and fortune-telling advertisements, there are many that are unreliable. Now advertising is becoming more and more advanced, and there is even something called "supplemental advertising." This method uses the supplement as a gimmick to receive the actual advertising effect, because these guys all use some kind of specialized knowledge to claim their status, and it is not easy for those who have not studied it to see through it.

### Weekly War Report

— Wu Guang

This week's war situation shows that the Chinese army, taking advantage of the remaining strength from last week, has been applying pressure to the Japanese army. In both the northern and southern battlefields, many important cities and towns have been reported as recaptured. As of now, the war is continuing to unfold. A brief account of the situation on each front is provided below.

Guangdong

In the Zengcheng area, Japanese troops have been launching offensives towards Pingfeng Ridge and Huluding in two directions for several days. The Chinese army is bravely resisting and has closely surrounded Zengcheng. In the Conghua area, Japanese troops are advancing towards Dawo Lang and Bie Wei. The Chinese army is flanking them from both sides, disrupting Japanese communication and causing significant losses. On both sides of the Xijiang River, in the areas of Xinhui and Jiangmen, fierce fighting continues. The strongholds of Makou, Xinxu, and Dagang have been successively recaptured. As for Hainan Island, Japanese troops also launched offensives towards Ding'an and Shu'an, but the Chinese army, resting and waiting, fiercely resisted. Simultaneously, another unit of the Chinese army seized the opportunity to recapture the city of Ding'an.

Nanchang

In Nanchang's Xiangtang, Japanese troops, using aircraft and artillery cover, repeatedly engaged the Chinese army in decisive battles, but the Chinese army has remained steadfast. Recently, the Chinese army bravely attacked, causing the Japanese to retreat towards Nanchang. Consequently, Xiangtang and the county seat of Gao'an were recaptured. The Chinese army, pressing the attack, regained control of Dachen. The Japanese army, unwilling to accept defeat, launched a large-scale counterattack, resulting in intense fighting. Later, due to a significant disparity in numbers, the Chinese army in Gao'an withdrew to its original positions. Furthermore, the Japanese troops in Wuning have been continuously counter-attacked by the Chinese army, leading to a fierce battle for control of the west side of the city. The situation is currently at a stalemate.

Hubei and Hunan

The Chinese army in eastern Hubei recently recaptured Lvwang City, Hekou Town, and Wangjia Shop and is currently encircling and annihilating the Japanese troops inside Huang'an City. The Chinese army in northern Hubei, a formidable force advancing on Yingshan and Anlu, continued its advance towards the county seat after recovering Haojia'an. The Japanese army has retreated towards Xiaogan. The Chinese army in central Hubei is successfully besieging Zhongxiang. The Japanese army in Wuhan, due to the Chinese army in eastern, northern, and central Hubei successively capturing key locations, is strengthening fortifications in an attempt to fight a decisive battle.

Shanxi

The Japanese troops advancing towards the Zhongtiao Mountains, after being repelled last week, are now active again. The Chinese army rushed to launch a fierce attack, causing them to retreat once more. The Japanese troops in Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Lingshi in eastern Shanxi have launched fierce offensives towards various locations south of Pingyao for several days, but have made no progress. The Japanese troops in Huo County, after their unsuccessful attack on Yangjiazhuang last week, launched another eastward offensive this week. After a week of fighting, their offensive has significantly weakened.

In addition, more than 3,000 Japanese troops in Xinyang, Henan Province, divided into three routes, one crossing the river at Xishuang River, one heading towards Yangliu River, and another approaching Xichuan, attempting to break through the encirclement and engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese army attacking Xinyang. The Chinese army launched attacks on multiple fronts, breaking through the Japanese positions. The encirclement is now shrinking. The Chinese army near Kaifeng suddenly launched a large-scale attack on the city walls before noon on the 11th, completely occupying all the key points and stations in the suburbs. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted in the city, but were ultimately repelled by the Chinese army. Subsequently, the Chinese army stormed into the city, recapturing the city walls, and intense fighting continues.

### Student Recruitment

A certain gentleman plans to recruit four drawing apprentices. Applicants must have a junior high school education, be between the ages of sixteen and twenty, and possess a deep interest in drawing art. Upon completion of the apprenticeship, a monthly income of forty yuan is expected, and job placement will be provided. The conditions are as follows:

1. Tuition and board is eight yuan per month, for a period of three years. Those who pass the examination must prepay for one year voluntarily.

Tuition will be waived for those who work while studying. Detailed arrangements will be discussed after admission.

2. Students who withdraw before finishing their studies must have a guarantor, and all losses shall be borne by the guarantor.

3. Applicants, regardless of whether they have studied drawing or not, should first submit a free-hand drawing from life and a self-recommendation letter by mail. Successful applicants will be contacted for an examination. Plagiarism or attempts to seek help from others will be futile.

Those who believe they meet the above conditions may submit their applications to Mr. Hu of this publication from now until the end of the fourth day of the month. Students from various art schools who believe they meet the above conditions will be given priority consideration.

### Refugees

— A Refugee Recorder

Some people get a headache at the mere mention of refugees.

They look down on refugees, considering them lowly, dirty, ignorant, and the dregs of society.

But let us think for ourselves. Among our comrades, there are also very capable people, very knowledgeable people. We should strive to rise up and earn the respect of society!

Naturally, dirtiness and foolishness are unavoidable. I think we should educate each other, supervise each other, and encourage each other, so as not to fail society's love, care, and expectations for us.

### Dunshen Road First Shelter

— Chun Fan

The Dunshen Road First Shelter is a newly established shelter. Precisely because it is newly established, we have new expectations for it, namely, that everything lacking in the equipment, management, and education of other shelters can be perfected in this new shelter. I heard from others that the Dunshen Road First Shelter is run very well, but I had never really known for sure. This time, I took some time to visit the shelter, and I felt that the First Shelter is not only first in name but also deserving of the title of "first" in terms of its performance. I will briefly introduce it below.

Before the war, everyone knew about the establishment of the Shanghai Public Village, right? – A towering gate, rows of houses, with crisscrossing lanes and complete facilities, including schools, squares, and recreation rooms. The impression of it remains vivid in my mind. This time, when I drove to the Dunshen Road First Shelter and looked around, it resembled a large village, with the same spirit as the Public Village. A memorial arch-style gate stood tall in the air, with the words "Shanghai Refugee Relief Association First Shelter" inscribed by Mr. Yu Qiaqing. Inside the gate was a square, with a main road in the middle and refugee reception rooms, security rooms, general offices, service centers, photography rooms, and refugee housing areas arranged on both sides. It looked tidy, clean, solemn, and quiet, making one breathe freely. To be honest, this situation is probably much better than living in a garret or kitchen in Shanghai, where people are suffocated by stuffy air and smog! I secretly congratulate the refugees. At the end is the fire station, with a fire engine parked inside to ensure safety. One can imagine how well-equipped the shelter is.

Facilities: The facilities include 19 districts, accommodating more than 5,000 refugees. The districts are divided as follows: the first district is the staff area, where staff families reside; the second district is the women's area, where female refugees reside; the third to seventh districts (and the eleventh, fourteenth, and eighteenth districts) are the family areas, where refugees with families reside; the eighth district is the disabled area, where disabled refugees reside; the ninth district is the single children's area, where orphaned children reside; the tenth district is the women and children's area, where women and children without fathers or husbands reside; the tenth and thirteenth districts are the single men's areas; and the nineteenth district is the vagrant area, where street vagrants reside. The division of districts is extremely reasonable and facilitates management, and the order is excellent. I patrolled the districts and asked people questions. Each so-called district is a large wooden building with ample sunlight and air. The refugees are all on wooden beds, which are stacked like bunk beds in a small hotel. This method is economical, does not take up space, and is also very aesthetically pleasing. Each district has two district chiefs who live near the entrance. They share the joys and hardships of the refugees, and manage affairs by setting an example. Therefore, everything related to supplies and sanitation is well-organized, which is commendable.

The shelter occupies a large area, surrounded by bamboo walls. For safety, it is further surrounded by barbed wire. There are many toilets and bathrooms for convenience. During my inspection of the area, I saw service centers that sell daily necessities to refugees, storage areas that store refugee supplies and belongings, and recreation rooms that provide refugees with entertainment and games. In addition, I also visited the kitchen, stove room, and laundry room. In the refugee clinic, I spoke with a patient who told me that the clinic is affiliated with the Red Cross and operates very diligently. Many patients have been cured under the responsible care of doctors and nurses. The patient, groaning in bed, told me, "Oh! Heaven and earth! The doctors and nurses here are really good!"

Management: I have already mentioned some aspects of the management earlier. In fact, the management of the First Shelter is no different from that of other shelters in Shanghai, but the rigor and thoroughness of the management are the characteristics of the First Shelter. Mr. Cai Renbao, the director of the shelter's general management office, is usually very diligent in his work, and especially strict in the management of the First Shelter. Mr. Cai has established regulations: no corruption, no malpractice, no smoking, no drinking. Whether staff or refugees, everyone is treated equally and abides by the regulations together. I saw that everyone in the shelter not only strictly adhered to the bans on smoking and drinking, but also could not spit casually. Moreover, there were tip boxes everywhere so that anyone could report illegal activities.

Regarding the entry and exit of refugees, each person has an entry and exit pass, which allows them to go out once a day. Special management personnel are responsible for issuing and collecting the passes. Refugees living in the shelter all wear badges indicating their place of origin, district, and number, and family members are also clearly identified. If there is an incident, it is easy to find out. Moreover, refugees must be photographed for record-keeping. Refugees who are adopted must also have a photograph taken with their adoptive parents for remembrance. According to the refugees, Mr. Cai personally gives a pep talk every morning in the shelter, which is broadcast to all districts via loudspeaker. Afterwards, there are broadcasts of music and storytelling, which are broadcast separately to entertain the audience. I have seen refugees sitting quietly, listening to the pep talk, which is also a good form of spiritual education.

Refugees: (1) I also asked about the refugees' lives. They have two meals a day, one porridge and one rice. They eat porridge at 10 a.m. and rice in the afternoon. Each person receives a piece of dried radish for each meal to eat with rice. Life is very hard, beyond the imagination of those who live in luxury. In the women and children's area, I spoke with a refugee child. Our conversation went like this: "My father was bombed to death on August 13th. My mother and I live here together. When my mother does laundry, we have some vegetables to eat, not always."

"Do you get to wash clothes every day?" "Only seven or eight times a month."

"How old are you this year?" "Thirteen." "You should help your mother with work!" "I used to scavenge (Note: meaning garbage), but because I couldn't beat others, my mother told me not to scavenge anymore." "So you don't have any vegetables to eat?"

(The child giggles.) "Hey! I'm asking you, how many bowls of rice do you eat?" "Four bowls." "Do you eat that much?" "If I don't eat a lot, I'll be hungry at night." "If that's the case, why don't you save some rice to eat at night?" (Everyone laughs!) "I can't, stealing rice will get me punished!" (Note: "Punished" means to be penalized).

The child's words are reasonable and touched my infinite sympathy. Alas! His situation should be borne by the warmongering imperialists.

In my observation, women and children are more active among the refugees. They are dissatisfied with refugee life and feel that being a refugee and receiving assistance from others is shameful. Therefore, they take every opportunity to find work. Some help people wash clothes, some help people assemble fans, some sew edges, and some weave towels. If they can't find anything to do, they mend and wash clothes for their children. They all come from poor families, and perhaps due to the habits of life, they have developed a hardworking nature. The children are also very robust. It seems that as long as there is something for them to do, they are happy to do it. Only the vagrants and a few men are lazy by nature. They seem to have little interest in self-reliance. In addition, many men are working outside on short-term jobs. It is very necessary for the Association authorities to establish refugee factories in the very near future so that refugees have the opportunity to be employed, turning consumption into production.

Education: (1) Education is quite important in refugee shelters. The First Shelter's education is divided into adult and children's education, and is overseen by Mr. Chen Heqin. When I walked into the children's playground (i.e., the children's school), I saw many students drilling, with orderly rows and full of spirit. Everyone was very happy. Another group of young children were in class, and the teacher was telling a story. They sat on small stools and listened attentively. Unfortunately, due to the situation, I had little contact with the school, especially with adult education, which I didn't see at all. I said goodbye very hastily.

In summary, I have not been able to fully describe the detailed situation of the First Shelter, especially its characteristics in management and the perfection of its facilities. There will inevitably be omissions. Fortunately, I will have the opportunity to describe it again in the future. Now I will stop writing.

### Shanghai City Construction Before the War (I)

— Lin Lang

I. Introduction

Shanghai is a major international port, with a population of over three million. Before the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), there was virtually no municipal construction to speak of. In the past, visitors often praised the wide and open roads, with a constant flow of traffic, but this was only in reference to the two special districts, the "Public Concession and the French Concession," and not the Chinese-administered city area. During the warlord era, the Nanshi and Zhabei districts each had their own public works and police donation bureaus, operating in a perfunctory and simple manner, with no initial achievements. Furthermore, the Shanghai Commercial Port Commissioner's Office lacked a sound organizational structure, and its effectiveness was inherently weak. Coupled with its short duration and financial difficulties, it was also unable to achieve any significant results.

The discussion of Shanghai's municipal construction should begin from the 16th year of the Republic of China. The first mayor, Mr. Huang Yingbai, followed the teachings of the Premier and sought to realize the Greater Shanghai Plan. Upon taking office, he had a concrete plan for the urban area and various constructions. At that time, the municipal government had just been established, and various bureaus were being set up one after another. Local public opinion was concerned that the scale was too large and the expenses were too great. Mr. Yingbai strongly rejected these objections, stating the following:

'Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and is watched by both domestic and international communities. All construction must be undertaken. Financial resources should indeed be cherished, and human resources should be valued. There must be sufficient reserves and appropriate use, so that construction projects can proceed smoothly. If we strive for reduction and are conservative in everything, then the Greater Shanghai Plan will be nothing more than empty words, which is not the way to adapt to circumstances. We should use our wisdom to decide on legislation and policy implementation, then use courage to implement it, and finally use perseverance to achieve it. This is what we ought to do. Why worry about frivolous words? Facts will be the answer in the future.'

After Mr. Yingbai left office, Mayor Zhang Boxuan succeeded him, continuing to work hard following the previous administration's policies. When Mayor Zhang Yuejun took office, he put in even more painstaking planning and diligent management, and the framework of Greater Shanghai began to take shape. After Mayor Wu Tiecheng took office, he further developed and expanded it, putting the original plan into practice. As a result, Shanghai's construction was splendid and well-prepared. Therefore, when discussing Shanghai's municipal construction, Mr. Huang Yingbai formulated the plan and laid the foundation, Mayor Zhang Boxuan and Mayor Zhang Yuejun followed the path and completed most of it, and Mayor Wu continued his efforts to achieve this great undertaking. The citizens of Shanghai have a consistent spirit towards the past leaders, creating welfare for the citizens and realizing the Premier's plan, always keeping it in mind, and it should be permanently engraved in their hearts and never forgotten.

To speak of the municipal construction of Greater Shanghai, there are countless aspects, and it is difficult to know where to start. What is described below is only about the most important aspects. We assume that Shanghai's municipal construction can be divided into three phases: expanding the roads in Nanshi and Zhabei and reorganizing existing public utilities as the first phase; developing urban traffic and opening roads as the second phase; and constructing the city center area as the third phase. We will conduct a detailed study of the construction in these three phases. Whether it belongs to the local or central government, it is all part of the entire plan to prosper Greater Shanghai and cannot be neglected. Now, the essence of the entire city has been destroyed in one fell swoop. For Shanghai alone, it is truly regrettable. For the entire country, it is not enough to express regret, because what the enemy can destroy is our material, but what they cannot destroy is our spirit. Without destruction, there is no way to build. Today's great destruction may well be the prelude to great construction in the future.

Furthermore, Shanghai's municipal construction has only been around for ten years, a very short period, but the grandeur of the planning has reached the level of a modern city. The day the enemy collapses will be the time for us to rebuild. If we are given another ten years, the progress of Shanghai's municipal administration is unimaginable. Is it a pity? Is it destruction?

(A) Construction of the City Center Area

Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang, once said in his proposed Greater Shanghai Plan: "Although Shanghai has now become the largest commercial port in China, if it remains unchanged, it will not be able to meet the needs and requirements of becoming a world commercial port in the future..." The past mayors of Shanghai have spared no effort in promoting the realization of Dr. Sun's Greater Shanghai Plan, transforming Shanghai's commercial port to adapt to the global trend. One of the most important aspects is the construction of the "core" city center area of Greater Shanghai.

The establishment of Shanghai's urban area and its various construction plans began during the time of the first mayor, Huang Fu. The determination of the city center area was decided in the 112th and 113th municipal conferences in July of the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929). At that time, it was stipulated that an area of approximately 7,000 mu (approximately 1,155 acres) north of Xiangyin Road in the Jiangwan District, south of Zhayin Road, east of Songhu Road, and west of Tu Yi Wu Tu in Zhou Nan Shi Tu, would be the city center area. In August of the same year, the "Shanghai City Center Area Construction Committee" was established to oversee design matters. Subsequently, all land and water transportation, road systems, zoning plans, and ditch docks were gradually carried out according to plan. By July of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), when the municipal government held its tenth-anniversary celebration, various constructions had become quite impressive, marking the end of a decade of creation and management. Unfortunately, a month later, the "August 13th" Incident broke out, and this splendid city center area was transformed into a field of rubble in an instant. When we look back on the past, we cannot help but feel grief and indignation! However, what people can destroy, we can build. The time to recover and expand it is not far away. The following is a summary of the important constructions in the city center area:

Water and Land Transportation The development of the city center area is closely related to water and land transportation. Therefore, the construction plan for its transportation includes the opening of the Wusong Port by waterway and the rerouting of the city's railway line by land. The purpose of opening Wusong Port is to adapt to the future prosperity of Shanghai, with the intention of using Wusong as a dock area to accommodate large foreign ships. It is also planned to dig a canal at a suitable location to connect Yunzaobang and Wusong River to facilitate transportation. This plan was not realized due to the large amount of funds required. The promotion of land transportation began with the rerouting of the existing railway, and the plan was as follows: Assume that a branch line is built near Zhenru, passing north through Dachang, east of Hujiazhuang, and turning east along the east bank of Yunzaobang to the Wusong River area, connecting to the commercial port and the Qiujiang dock; another branch line is diverted from Zhenru, passing through Pengpu to Jiangwan, to serve as the future Shanghai Central Station. During the "January 28th" Incident, this station was destroyed. The Ministry of Railways adopted the municipal government's suggestion and decided to use the area near Pengpu Zhongshan Road as the joint transportation headquarters for the two lines, but it was also abandoned due to funding issues. Building a bridge across the Huangpu River is also one of the plans to promote water and land transportation. The bridge locations are: one at the eastern end of Wuquan Road, which can connect to Gaohang and Gaoqiao districts in Pudong on the opposite bank; and one near Longhua Mouth, in preparation for the future extension of the railway line to Pudong, connecting the transportation lines in Pudong and Puxi.

Roads and Ditches According to the city center area road system plan, there are more than 200 roads in total, which can be divided into two points: First, trunk roads, extending in all four directions from the city center area, like rays of starlight, to connect commercial ports, docks, and various urban areas. Those that have been built are: Qimei Road, Huangxing Road, Sanmin Road, Wuquan Road, Shijie Road, Datong Road, Songhu Road, Jungong Road, Shuidian Road, Zhayin Road, and part of Zhongshan North Road. Second, secondary roads are built to facilitate commerce and transportation in the city center area and its surrounding areas. The city center area is divided into five sub-districts: northeast, southeast, northwest, southwest, and central, by Shijie Road, Datong Road, Sanmin Road, and Wuquan Road. Except for the central district, which has road names prefixed with "Fu" (府), the longitudinal roads in the northeast district have road names prefixed with "Zhong" (中), and the transverse roads are prefixed with "Shang" (上). The longitudinal roads in the southeast district are prefixed with "Hua" (華), and the transverse roads are prefixed with "Hai" (海). The longitudinal roads in the northwest district are prefixed with "Min" (民), and the transverse roads are prefixed with "Shi" (市). The longitudinal roads in the southwest district are prefixed with "Guo" (國), and the transverse roads are prefixed with "Zheng" (政). Therefore, within the city center area, the longitudinal roads are sequentially prefixed with the characters "Zhong" (中), "Hua" (華), "Min" (民), and "Guo" (國). The transverse roads are sequentially prefixed with the characters "Shang" (上), "Hai" (海), "Shi" (市), and "Zheng" (政). The road names in the central part are all prefixed with "Fu" (府). The roads in the first and second requisition areas, and the municipal government employee requisition area, have a total length of 119 kilometers. Among them, the trunk roads connecting to the old urban area are: Qimei Road, connecting Disiwei Road from the intersection of Xiangyin Road and Songhu Road, with a total length of 5.025 kilometers and a width of 35 meters; Huangxing Road, connecting Songhu Road in the city center area and Ningguo Road in Yangshupu, with a total length of 11.65 kilometers and an actual width of 30 meters; Xiangyin Road, a major traffic artery connecting Zhabei District and North Sichuan Road. The ditches in the city center area adopt a combined system, and the layout of each ditch pipe adopts a radial pattern due to the terrain. Through several years of construction, the ditch pipes in the first and second requisition areas and the employee requisition area have been completely buried, with a total length of 36 kilometers.

Zoning The city center area is divided into three major areas, namely: 1. The administrative area, located in the central part of the city center area, where all administrative agencies and important public buildings, such as the municipal government and various bureaus, the municipal council, the party headquarters, the library, the museum, and the aviation association, are built. 2. Residential and commercial areas, all land except for the administrative area and park area is designated for residential and commercial use. The residential area is further divided into two types: those located near the park and open space are used for the construction of high-end residences; other land, not in the above example, is used for the construction of ordinary residences. As of the fall of the previous year, there were distributions of residences, shops, and vegetable markets in the first and second requisition areas. 3. Park and open space area, which includes the First Park, the municipal park branch, and the municipal sports field. Other areas that require open space for municipal hospitals, hygiene experimental institutes, municipal experimental elementary schools, and other public buildings are also built in this area.

Municipal Government Building The construction of the municipal government building was first planned by the Construction Committee to formulate design standards, which are divided into three points: 1. The three-dimensional style of the new municipal government should adopt the Chinese style; 2. The plane layout of the new municipal government should be divided into separate bureaus; 3. The construction steps of the new municipal government should be divided into two parts. After the standards were set, the committee formulated a method of soliciting designs for the new municipal government building with a reward, which began on October 1 of the 18th year (1929). The determined design was based on the architecture of the Palace in Beijing, incorporating modern needs, so that both aesthetics and practicality were combined. In July of the 19th year (1930), an architect's office was established to create all drawings and specifications, which were approved by the municipal conference, and bidding began. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 7, and construction was suspended for five months due to the impact of the "January 28th" Incident. It was completed in October of the 22nd year (1933), and the completion ceremony was held on the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the country. From December 25th, the municipal government began to move into the new building to work, and various bureaus also moved into temporary houses separately. After the outbreak of the August 13th War, the city center area became a war zone, and this towering building was also damaged by Japanese artillery fire. The municipal government building is a Chinese-style building, divided into four floors. From the outside, the first floor is a platform, and above the platform is a two-story palace-style building. The top floor is hidden inside the roof. Inside, the first and third floors are office space, the second floor is a large auditorium, library, and conference room, and the fourth floor is used for storing files, sundries, and housing staff. The total area of each floor is 8,982 square meters; the highest point of the roof is 31 meters above the ground; the total length of the entire building is about 93 meters; the width is 25 meters in the middle and 20 meters on both sides. The exterior adopts a beam-column structure, the roof is covered with green glazed tiles, and the roof ridge is decorated with golden yellow glazed tiles and cement gilded decorations, which is extremely luxurious and solemn. All four sides of the building are equipped with steel doors and windows, and stone steps are built on all four sides of the lower floor. The stone steps on the front reach directly to the front door of the auditorium from the ground outside the house, forming a bridge so that vehicles can directly reach the front door. There are two stone lions and two flagpole platforms next to the steps. Whenever the weather is clear, the Chinese flag with the blue sky, white sun, and red earth flies high on the flagpole, fluttering in the wind, which is pleasing to the eye. The interior layout of the municipal government building combines Chinese and Western styles, focusing on practicality. In terms of the area of each room, the auditorium, library, and dining hall are the largest, as they are for the public use of the entire municipal government, including affiliated bureaus. The municipal government building is a new building, and its electrical equipment is extremely perfect. More innovative features include: telephone conference equipment, for the chairman and ten other people to communicate and hold meetings, so that important staff can hold meetings by telephone without leaving their seats; a search equipment, which can use lights and bells to send 27 kinds of signals in 30 locations, for searching for 27 people; a fire alarm equipment, so that if a fire occurs, the management personnel can immediately know the location of the fire, for emergency disposal. Other small statistics of electrical equipment are as follows: the large reception room is equipped with an electric master clock, with 36 slave clocks attached; the whole house is equipped with 455 electric lights; 18 electric fans and wall fans, 31 ceiling fans; 2 elevators. In addition to electrical equipment, all heating pipes and sanitary equipment are very thoughtful. The total cost of the municipal government building was 780,000 national currency. The electrical appliances and equipment cost about 90,000 yuan. In addition to the municipal government building, the two temporary houses of the five affiliated bureaus of social affairs, education, hygiene, land, and public works cost a total of 214,400 yuan, which started construction in February of the 22nd year (1933) and was completed in July of the same year.

Other Buildings In addition to the municipal government building, the great buildings in the city center area also include sports fields, museums, and libraries. The general situation is described as follows: (1) Municipal Sports Field. Construction began in August of the 23rd year (1934) and was completed in September of the 24th year (1935). The entire site includes a sports field, swimming pool, and gymnasium, covering an area of approximately 300 mu (approximately 49 acres). Three years ago, when the National Games were held in Shanghai, as many as 150,000 people visited the municipal sports field, which was truly a grand event. The cost of the above three parts of the project is estimated to be about 1.15 million yuan. Building a large-scale sports field with such a large amount of money is still a pioneering undertaking in China. The main building of the municipal sports field is the sports field. At the beginning of construction, it was estimated that the field should accommodate at least 60,000 spectators when the National Games were held. However, due to funding limitations, the total number of seats in the field was limited to 50,000, but there is still room for the construction of 20,000 seats. The main purpose of the sports field is for track and field events. There is a football field in the center, and tennis and basketball courts on both ends. The oval-shaped field is 500 meters in total, and the long runways on both sides are 200 meters each. The design of the spectators' seats is novel, and the entrance and exit traffic is extremely convenient, which is its characteristic. The design of ticket sales and management is also advanced. The rest or office buildings for athletes and staff are also quite spacious, accommodating about 2,000 people. The remaining space under the stands is used as much as possible, and is used for paving, lavatories, and ticket sales. There are many flagpoles around the stands, and the colorful flags fluttering on the day of the sports meet add a lot of color to the entire venue. All building materials are steel and cement, but the base is made of red brick and artificial stone, and the outer wall is made of lid stone, because they are both economical and durable. The swimming pool is open-air, with 5,000 seats around it. Under the stands, there are changing rooms, showers, restrooms, paving, lavatories, boiler rooms, and water filter rooms. The pool is 50 meters long and 20 meters wide, built according to the standards of the Far Eastern Games. The deepest consideration in the pool is 11 feet 6 inches, the shallower consideration is 6 feet deep, and the shallowest point is 4 feet, and its shape is "spoon-shaped". The total amount of water in the pool is 600,000 gallons. If you want to change the water from time to time, the cost is very high, and the time to change the water once takes up to 10 hours. The new type of swimming pool popular in the world today has abolished the method of changing water, and replaced it with a water filter. The water filter runs continuously, and every six hours, the water in the entire pool is completely filtered, so the water in the pool is always clean. The light arrangement is also one of the characteristics of this pool. Strong light bulbs are installed on the pool wall below the water surface, and the pool water reflects light at night, which is clear and lovely. The gymnasium is the main venue for indoor sports, and all the arrangements are made in the latest style. The whole venue has 3,500 fixed grandstand seats and 1,500 temporary seats, and can be increased if necessary. The area of the venue is 131 feet by 76 feet, which is enough for three basketball teams. The roof of the gymnasium is arched, the highest ceiling is 63 feet from the floor, the total length of the building is 270 feet, and the total width is 150 feet. After entering the hall, the audience is led to the seats in the tier through two stairs. The entrance area is very spacious, and there are offices, ticket offices, and lavatories on both sides. All building materials, except for the floor and doors, which are made of wood, are steel and cement. The lighting equipment is also good.

### Black and White

— Luo Xi

"A gentleman loves money, but he earns it in a proper way" is originally a very common and universal principle. However, on the isolated island today, finding a truly "money-loving gentleman" who "earns it in a proper way" is indeed something that can only be done among thousands or tens of thousands!

Who doesn't want money? However, it must be "earned in a proper way"! The so-called "way" does not include all roads that can lead to wealth, but only those that do not violate one's conscience or betray the nation and the people can be called "way"! Can it be that the pseudo-gentlemen who now specialize in seeking personal gain through malpractice, making war profits, shamelessly serving the enemy, and selling evil deeds (such as fraud, drug trafficking, etc.) while "acquiring wealth" are unaware of this principle? No, on the contrary, they often use "seeking welfare for the public" as their slogan. The recent case of malpractice in the charitable organizations in this city is a clear example! They have never been unaware that malpractice, seeking personal gain, serving the enemy, selling evil deeds, and making war profits all result in doing evil and breaking the law. But why do they put up a sheep's head and sell dog meat, knowingly committing crimes? In short, it is only because of "selfishness and self-interest"! Basically, they have not considered "when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold."

The full-scale war of resistance has continued to this day, and black and white have been clearly illuminated by the torch of justice. We no longer need to ask these pseudo-gentlemen to show their already blackened conscience. Our only way to deal with them is to severely punish them according to the national law!

Under the illuminating torch of radiant justice, black and white will never be confused!

### Shanghai Children in the Mainland

— Camon

The Great Achievements of the "Children's Troupe"

A large truck without horses, which is rarely seen elsewhere, drove into a village. On the truck were more than a dozen boys and girls wearing gray uniforms, with earnest expressions on their faces. They delivered letters in the army, posted picture slogans in all the villages, and distributed leaflets to farmers. The villagers were all expressing surprise. They didn't know the words, but they could see things like birds on the pictures throwing eggs down, and women and children being bombed to death.

That afternoon, these newly arrived children held a meeting on an open space in the village. A small, thin-faced child who looked like he was twelve years old stood on a rough platform and said, "China is unified. There is another country called Japan that is attacking China and wants to conquer and divide China." The villagers just stared at each other in amazement. They were wondering who the Japanese were, but the young speaker did not lose courage even though he didn't get any response.

"They come faster than locusts," he said. "In machines that can fly, they will kill you. They will burn your houses, destroy your wives, take your land, and make you slaves... They have already done these things in other villages, and they will do the same in your village." In the crowd, it was as if there was an electric current. They understood these words. Land, were they willing to give it up? Wives, were they willing to be humiliated? Houses, were they willing to have them burned down? They were hoping that these soldiers would be stationed in the village to protect their lives and property. However, the lecturing child seized this moment of psychology and continued to speak:

"We must fight them," he said loudly. "We must drive them out of our country and make them go back to the sea from which they came." Indeed, many villagers in China still don't know these things. These children, who are responsible for publicizing and awakening the villagers, are the Shanghai "Children's Troupe," which is the core of China's "Little Devils."

On the evening of October 27, 1937, Zhabei was on fire, and the whole of Shanghai was in flames. On the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, a team of soldiers guarded the Sihang Warehouse and fought the Japanese in the last heroic resistance, earning the title of "Lone Army" and creating a glorious page in Chinese history. At this time, in a church on Nanjing Road, twenty-one boys and girls gathered in a room to discuss what work they would do in the future. Most of them were boy and girl scouts aged nine to thirteen who had been working in Shanghai for three months rescuing wounded soldiers and delivering messages.

The brave Chinese soldiers (who everyone was sure would win victory for China!) had left Shanghai, but they were determined not to stay behind. After a night of meetings, they decided to take on their wartime responsibilities. After another day of preparations the next day, they didn't tell their parents and took a boat to Nanjing behind their backs. However, the government only regarded the twenty-one of them as refugee children, which made them very disappointed. They had come to help China win, not to live in a reception center. But in the extremely tense situation in Nanjing, their enthusiasm was no longer noticed.

Two weeks before the fall of Nanjing, they decided to go deeper into the mainland again. When they arrived in Xuzhou, they had a total of sixty children and worked in every village they could enter under the name of "Children's Troupe." The people in the villages all regarded them as soldiers, and the local government also knew that the work they were doing was something that children in other countries could not do, creating an amazing page in history. They needed food, and the farmers were also willing to give it to them. Farmers have never had a good impression of soldiers, but they already know that the current soldiers are fighting for China to resist the greedy Japanese.

Later, they went to various places after leaving Chuzhou. In a certain village, they met several representatives of the Eighth Route Army guerrillas who taught them how to perform a play and how to speak to the public. This "Children's Troupe" was officially established in Shanghai two and a half years ago, and now its footprints have spread all over the map of China. The general public is very enthusiastic about their work, and they have become the core of the "Little Devils."

### Training Workers

— Yu Quan

They do the same work as "official" workers, but receive no wages and even have to pay for "raw material losses."

The term "training worker," when mentioned, might sound unfamiliar to many, right? A worker who is new to the factory and doesn't know how to do the work, who is just starting to learn, is called a "training worker." These workers don't receive wages because they originally don't know how to do the work. They only consume the "raw materials" of the factory and don't actually produce anything. Therefore, "training workers" not only don't receive wages, but some even have to pay the factory a certain amount of "raw material loss fee" each month. Moreover, these workers must work in the factory as "training workers" for five or six months before they can become "official" workers and be paid wages. However, the "raw material loss fee" paid to the factory during these five or six months is already quite substantial. Who knows how many days it will take before the wages they receive are truly the money issued by the factory?

The life of a "training worker" is exactly the same as that of an "official" worker, and they also eat their own food. In the first few days of learning to work, they are naturally not very skilled and must consume some "raw materials." However, after ten days or half a month, the work they do will gradually become more skilled, and what they produce can be exactly the same as what "official" workers produce. It certainly won't take five or six months to learn. Therefore, this is undoubtedly a means for factory-opening capitalists to exploit workers. However, some factories may allow workers to receive wages after one or two months, but this is extremely rare and depends on the "charitable heart" of the capitalist.

Poor people go to work in factories originally hoping to earn some wages to solve their livelihood problems. However, after working hard for the factory, not only do they not receive wages, but they have to pay money to subsidize the factory's "raw material costs." Is there such a reason? However, in the eyes of capitalists, besides money, there is absolutely no such thing as "humanity," "charity," or "human sympathy." They only try every possible method to exploit and extract workers, treating the workers' sweat and blood as the only tool for making money. In a capitalist society, when will impoverished workers see the light of day?

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 8: Is it Illusion or Reality, is Life a Stage Play? When to Advance or Retreat, Making Home Wherever You Are.

After Xiangzi returned, she was able to accompany her lonely father. However, the family was extremely poor. Her father was originally a university professor, but now he was unemployed. Her elder brother had always been an entrepreneur, but after joining the army, he had to abandon his job. Although their government provided subsidies for soldiers going to war, it later became only nominal. Therefore, they could no longer live in the city and had to move to the countryside. At this time, Xiangzi still couldn't let people know that she had married a Chinese man, and being divorced by a Chinese man would make people look down on her even more. However, the people in the countryside were even more likely to ask questions and pry into her affairs, and sometimes even deliberately spread rumors about her. Moreover, because Xiangzi was exceptionally beautiful and known as a beauty, a group of lecherous men in the countryside coveted her, causing her to constantly defend herself. Fortunately, she later gave birth to a baby boy. The laughter of children in the house could somewhat soothe the loneliness. The three of them, grandfather, granddaughter, and great-grandson, lived in the countryside, barely making ends meet. However, unfortunate news came: her brother had died in battle in the Xiang-E area of inland China. His remains could not be returned to his hometown. Only a jar of ashes was returned to the country, and it was unknown whether it was her brother's or not. Xiangzi and her brother had a very good relationship, and she cried as if her heart would break. Her old father only had this one son, so he was naturally even more grief-stricken. Because he was old and had suffered such hardship, he spent his days writing in the air, sighing in despair. He thought: It's all the fault of the domestic warlords. If they weren't ambitious and wantonly invading other countries, there wouldn't have been any war. If there hadn't been any war, we could have lived and worked in peace and contentment. Why would we have suffered such a fate of losing our daughter and having our family broken? Today, wouldn't we still be a modestly prosperous family with all our members together? He was an old teacher who liked to write. In his anger and resentment, he wrote an article, an anti-aggression and anti-war treatise. However, this article caused a major problem. After being reported, the old teacher was imprisoned. The old teacher was already heartbroken over the loss of his son. How could he withstand the suffering of imprisonment? He soon died. At this time, Xiangzi had no one left in her family. She thought that there was nothing to keep her in her country anymore, so she might as well go to China. When she got to China, she could hide in some remote rural area for a few years. Because she already spoke fluent Chinese and had gotten used to wearing Chinese clothes, she had long since become naturalized in China, and no one could tell that she was a Japanese woman. When she got to China, if she was lucky enough to meet Mr. Chen, she could return this little child to him, preserving a bit of his bloodline. Then my wish would be fulfilled. (88)
