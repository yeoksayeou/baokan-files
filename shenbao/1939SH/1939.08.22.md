### Fierce Battles in Southeastern Shanxi for Over Ten Days; Chinese Troops Completely Recapture Jincheng; Simultaneously Recover Tianjingguan and Jinmiaopu on the Border of Shanxi and Henan; Japanese Plan to Open the Tongpu and Daoqing Railways Completely Shattered

Luoyang. The battle for Jincheng, fought fiercely for over ten days, finally came to a temporary end on the 20th. Summarizing from the morning of the 10th of last month, after the Japanese troops at Zhangma (southwest of Yangcheng) were heavily attacked by the Chinese, the remaining Japanese troops retreated westward. The Japanese troops on the Yi-Qin Highway were completely cleared by the Chinese forces. A valiant unit of the Chinese army then took advantage of the situation to advance eastward and launched an attack on the Japanese troops in Jincheng, aiming to completely control the Yi-Jin Highway and cut off the Japanese supply line between Henan and Shanxi. After fierce fighting on the 11th and 12th, the Chinese army achieved a great victory, advancing with irresistible force. On the 11th, they had already approached the western suburbs of Jincheng. At the same time, a guerrilla unit also detoured from a certain area to the northern suburbs of Jincheng, occupied the high ground north of the city, and launched a two-pronged attack. In a state of extreme panic, the Japanese army concentrated more than 4,000 troops and launched a fierce attack on the main force of the Chinese army in the west of the city with dense artillery fire, attempting a desperate gamble. However, the Chinese forces had long anticipated their scheme. A unit retreated slightly, luring the Japanese troops out of the city. On the 13th at noon, a unit north of the city charged into the city walls, resulting in street fighting. After many days of fierce fighting, several Japanese planes arrived to assist in the battle, and the Chinese army retreated slightly, turning to the suburbs of the city to continue the siege of the Japanese troops. A unit of the Chinese army then detoured to the "Gaoping" highway south of Jincheng to destroy it. At this point, the Japanese troops were completely surrounded by the Chinese forces and found themselves in a desperate situation. On the night of the 19th, the Chinese forces issued a general attack order, launching a four-sided siege and a determined assault. After fighting fiercely for a night, the Japanese troops could not hold out and broke through, fleeing to Sanliqiao, Wangtai, and Qilingcun (all northeast of Jincheng). At dawn on the 20th, the Chinese army completely recaptured Jincheng. In this battle, more than four or five hundred Japanese troops were killed, and a large amount of military supplies were seized. Jincheng is an important stronghold in southern Shanxi, controlling the end of the Bai-Jin Road and the Yi-Jin Road, facing the mountains and backing the river, controlling Henan and Hebei. The Japanese relied on it to harass eastern Shanxi, and Jincheng served as the only barrier. The Japanese's previous decision to divide their forces into nine routes to harass southeastern Shanxi was ultimately aimed at this. Now that it has been recaptured by the Chinese forces, it will greatly benefit the future of the Chinese Taihang Mountain campaign. At the moment, a certain unit of the Chinese army is dividing its forces to pursue the remaining Japanese troops. (21st dispatch)

(Xi'an) News from the front: The Japanese troops in Jincheng, after being besieged by the Chinese army for days, suffered heavy casualties. On the afternoon of the 19th, most of them broke through and fled north. On the morning of the 20th, the Chinese army recaptured Jincheng, and the remnants were completely eliminated by the Chinese army. At the same time, a team was sent to track and pursue the enemy, engaging in fierce battles in the Sanliqiao, Qilingcun, and Wutaizhen (all northeast of Jincheng) area. On the same day, the Japanese troops at Tianjingguan and Jinmiaopu, south of Jincheng, were heavily attacked by the Chinese army and fled south in disarray. After the Chinese army captured these two strongholds, the pursuing troops have now reached [omitted text]. The remaining Japanese troops will be annihilated within a short period of time. (21st dispatch)

Tongguan. The Chinese troops attacking Jincheng bravely charged into the city on the morning of the 20th, completely wiping out the Japanese troops entrenched in the southeast of the city. The Japanese troops fled north in disarray, and the Chinese army recaptured Jincheng. Subsequently, the Japanese troops sent reinforcements and counterattacked from the northwest. However, they were ambushed and intercepted by the Chinese troops along the way. The Japanese troops abandoned more than two hundred bodies and fled back the way they came. The Japanese army attempted to capture Jincheng three times, but each time they were quickly driven out by the Chinese army. Their plan to "mop up" the Chinese Taihang Mountains has once again been shattered. (21st dispatch)

Xingji. On the evening of the 14th, the Chinese army selected a valiant team of [omitted text] men to launch a surprise attack on the Japanese troops at Huchi (west of Lingshi). They immediately charged into the streets, resulting in fierce street fighting. By 12:00 midnight, the Chinese army had completely recaptured the town, killing more than a hundred Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese troops fled eastward in a panic. (20th dispatch)

(Xi'an) In the southeastern Shanxi battle situation, after the Japanese army forcibly occupied the Bai-Jin Highway with the superior force of five divisions, the Chinese army adopted a scorched earth tactic, avoiding a frontal confrontation, and deploying on both sides of the mountains. Not only did they not suffer any losses, but for a week, they took advantage of the Japanese army's unstable footing to intercept them in various ways. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, and the Chinese army successively recovered important strongholds such as Yangcheng and Qinshui west of the highway, and Linxian east of the highway. For days, the Chinese army besieged Jincheng, aiming to fundamentally shatter the Japanese attempt to open up the Tongpu and Daoqing railway lines. By the evening of the 19th, the Japanese troops suddenly collapsed and retreated north from Jincheng. On the morning of the 20th, the Chinese army recovered Jincheng and pursued them north to the Sanliqiao, Qilingcun, and Wangtai area. At the same time, the Japanese troops within fifty miles south of Jincheng were also completely eliminated. On the evening of the 20th, the Chinese army also captured Tianjingguan and Jinmiaopu, on the border of Shanxi and Henan. In total, they killed or wounded more than two thousand Japanese troops and seized more than a thousand rifles. The Japanese army's plan to open up the Bai-Jin Highway was originally intended to "mop up" the Chinese southeastern Shanxi base area on one hand, and to prepare to build railways on the other, secretly preparing the foundation for an attack on the Northwest. Now, after the Chinese army's counter-offensive, this plan can be said to have been shattered. (21st dispatch)

Dali. A certain unit of the Chinese army launched a multi-pronged attack on the Japanese troops in Yuxiang and Qinghuazhen the night before last. The Japanese troops stubbornly resisted from their fortifications. The Chinese army fought valiantly and also used a surprise force to attack the rear of the Japanese troops, launching a four-sided attack. The fierce fighting lasted all night, and the Japanese troops suffered extremely heavy casualties. The next morning, Qinghuazhen was recaptured. The Japanese troops in Yuxiang were shaken and also showed signs of fleeing. They are currently under heavy attack. (21st dispatch)

### Tokyo Negotiations Break Down Inconspicuously; British Foreign Office Explains the Situation; Economic Issues Inconvenient to Discuss Unilaterally

London. The Foreign Office recently issued a formal statement on the Anglo-Japanese Tokyo negotiations. The full text is as follows: "The British and Japanese governments, after exchanging views, agreed on June 27 to hold talks in Tokyo to resolve various issues related to the current situation in Tianjin. Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita immediately began preliminary talks on July 15. This was reported to the House of Commons by Prime Minister Chamberlain on July 24. In the early stages of the talks, the Japanese government expressed the view that if Britain and Japan wish to dispel misunderstandings and improve relations, they should first acknowledge the background of the situation in Tianjin and use it as a basis for research. In order to accommodate this view, the British government agreed with the Japanese government on a plan as follows: "The British government fully acknowledges the large-scale military operations currently taking place in China, and acknowledges that as long as this situation continues, the Japanese army has various special needs to ensure its security and maintain public order in the areas it controls. Any actions that hinder the Japanese army and facilitate its enemies must be restrained by the Japanese army. The British government has no intention to encourage or sponsor any actions or measures that would hinder the Japanese army from achieving the above-mentioned goals. We take this opportunity to reiterate this policy and notify British officials and citizens in China not to engage in such actions or measures." The British and Japanese representatives began negotiations on the day the plan was agreed upon. The Japanese government also put forward several proposals as a basis for discussion, most of which were related to police affairs, advocating that the British concession authorities cooperate with the Japanese army in North China to curb terrorist activities and maintain the rule of law and order, but without prejudice to the integrity of the administrative power of the British concession, and generally based on the current practices in Shanghai. On this point, the talks have made important progress, and an agreement can be reached after a few details are resolved. However, in addition to police affairs, the Japanese government has also put forward several proposals, requesting the British authorities to prohibit the use of Chinese legal tender in the British concession and to transfer the silver stored in the concession and in the Legation Quarter in Beijing. The British government immediately understood that the scope of these proposals was not limited to local incidents in Tianjin, but was related to economic and financial issues in North China, such as exchange rates and various trade restrictions. The British and a certain government have already notified the Japanese government of their views on this matter. After careful study, the British government deeply understands that if Britain and Japan conclude an agreement on these issues without the consent of other countries, it would hinder the position of those countries. Therefore, the British government, even if it is willing to reach an agreement with Japan, is not in a position to do so, and cannot independently propose or accept any proposals on these issues that would harm the interests of third countries. It has already advised the Japanese government that, in the British view, the various economic proposals put forward by Japan cannot produce beneficial results if they are only discussed by Britain and Japan. However, if the interests of all relevant countries can be protected, Britain is prepared to reconsider its position. Therefore, it seems that both the British and Japanese governments should solicit and consider the opinions of third countries. In short, the British government has no intention of evading the issues raised by the Japanese government, and understands that these issues must be thoroughly discussed when the current disputes in China are finally resolved. The British government issued a note to the Japanese government on January 14 of this year, stating that the existing treaties are not considered to be of a permanent nature. If the Japanese government can put forward constructive proposals in the hope of amending them, the British government is also prepared to consider them. However, all the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty and other treaties related to China must be allowed to express their views and make mutual contributions at an appropriate time, so that all relevant countries can be treated fairly. This is the most important plan." (20th Havas dispatch)

Washington. According to diplomatic circles here, Britain's advocacy of convening a Nine-Power Conference to resolve various issues between Britain and Japan is completely consistent with the US note to Japan on December 11 of last year. This is because the United States stated in this note that any treaty in the Far East could be considered if it could be jointly participated in by all signatory countries (including China). US Undersecretary of State Welles also stated that the US attitude remains unchanged to this day, but no country has proposed this point to the US so far. (21st Associated Press dispatch)

Tokyo. This morning, the Japanese government issued a lengthy statement through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, refuting the British view. The main points are as follows: The Anglo-Japanese talks were held at the request of Britain. The Japanese government initially believed that it was necessary to first discuss the general issues that were the background to the Tianjin problem and obtain the understanding of the British government. The preliminary results of the talks led to the conclusion of an agreement on the 22nd of last month. The Anglo-Japanese talks then began to discuss the various specific issues related to the Tianjin case. The Japanese side put forward police and economic issues at this meeting, as these were necessary issues for maintaining local security and the survival of the Japanese army. The matters that the Japanese side requested the British side to cooperate with were all matters that the British side could implement within its authority. It goes without saying that these matters should not be considered outside the scope of this meeting. It is also unreasonable to say that these matters are not just issues to be agreed upon by Britain and Japan. For example, regarding the issues of legal tender and silver, the Japanese side requested the British side to prevent the result of the circulation of legal tender in the British concession in Tianjin, which has led to unscrupulous elements taking advantage of this matter to engage in disruptive economic activities inside and outside the concession. Regarding the silver issue, the Japanese government was merely requesting the British government not to allow the British concession authorities to interfere with the removal of silver stored within the concession. These are all issues that should be agreed upon between Britain and Japan, and are local issues in Tianjin, leaving no room for discussion. When the Japanese side accepted the British proposal to begin the Tokyo talks, it had already stated that the issues raised by the Japanese government were naturally related to the military, political, and economic issues in Tianjin, and the British government also acknowledged this before the talks began. Furthermore, on July 27, when the British and Japanese representatives first decided to discuss economic issues, the Japanese representative again notified the British representative of this purpose. At that time, the British representative also expressed agreement and promised to hold a subcommittee on August 1 to specifically review economic issues. From this perspective, it is extremely clear that the British government had no intention of excluding economic issues from the beginning. The British government's statement that it is not abandoning this issue or delaying its resolution, while at the same time advocating that this issue be resolved when the Sino-Japanese incident ends, is contradictory in its language. The final paragraph of the British government's statement invokes the Nine-Power Treaty. However, the Japanese government has repeatedly stated its views on the Nine-Power Treaty, which are now difficult to understand. What use is the Nine-Power Treaty for resolving the Tianjin problem? If the British government wants to rope in third countries to participate in the negotiations in order to obtain favorable results, this move will only complicate the case and delay the resolution period. The Japanese government cannot tolerate this and hereby declares. (21st Domei dispatch)

### Neither Britain Nor Japan Acknowledge a Breakdown; Japan Also Demands the Maintenance of the Preliminary Agreement

London. Regarding the Anglo-Japanese Tokyo negotiations, after the Foreign Office issued a statement yesterday, Foreign Office officials have now explained, stating that the suspension of these negotiations was initiated by Japan. If the government of that country reverses its intentions, negotiations can still be reopened within the scope of the Tokyo plan. However, if they insist that the Chinese currency and silver deposits in Tianjin must be put to discussion, the opinions of all relevant countries should be solicited, and if necessary, they should be invited to participate in the talks. (21st Havas dispatch)

Tokyo. This morning, when the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosted a press conference, the questioners focused on the point of whether the Anglo-Japanese conference would continue. A reporter asked whether the Anglo-Japanese negotiations had broken down. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that he had not seen the words "suspension of talks" in the statements of both Britain and Japan. The spokesperson mentioned the British statement, saying that there was a passage in it as follows: "In addition to the proposals regarding policing, the Japanese government has made several other proposals, including the British authorities prohibiting the circulation of Chinese legal tender in the British concession in Tianjin and transferring some of the silver deposits in the British concession and the Legation Quarter in Beijing." This statement is indeed inaccurate. Although Japan requested the transfer of Chinese silver deposits in the British concession in Tianjin, it never requested the transfer of Chinese silver deposits in the Legation Quarter in Beijing. The spokesperson continued, "I do not wish to elaborate on the steps that Japan may take hereafter." A foreign reporter asked, "What is Japan's attitude towards the Nine-Power Treaty?" The spokesperson said, "The Japanese Foreign Minister has repeatedly explained the Japanese government's attitude towards this outdated and inapplicable treaty in his speeches in the Diet and in his own statements." A reporter asked, "Who will initiate the Anglo-Japanese talks in the future?" The spokesperson replied, "This procedure may be disclosed soon." The spokesperson also replied that he had not seen official information regarding the Guangzhou Japanese military spokesperson's so-called blockade of Hong Kong. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo. At 9:00 this morning, Prime Minister Hiranuma met with the Emperor at the Hayama Imperial Villa, presenting the domestic and foreign situation. He then visited Minister of Home Affairs Yuasa, explaining the Anglo-Japanese conference and the government's policy towards the new situation in Europe. It is said that Hiranuma told Yuasa that although the government intends to convene a five-minister conference as soon as possible to make a final decision, it is seriously considering the matter in view of the importance of the issue. The Asahi Shimbun predicted today that Anglo-Japanese relations will return to the original state before the roundtable conference began. US-Japanese relations may be eventful, as the United States clearly wants to maintain the Nine-Power Treaty and the original state of China. The Japanese government will handle the abolition of the Nine-Power Treaty in a more realistic way. (21st Reuters dispatch)

Editorial

### Hungary in the European Situation

Any country, anyone, if they don't talk about the European situation, that's fine, but if they do, they all agree on the severity of the situation. The focus of the severity is on the problem of the Free City of Danzig; in fact, the so-called crisis everywhere is not a false statement, that is, outside of Danzig, there are crises everywhere. Regarding Danzig, this newspaper has made several comments; today, please elaborate on the crisis lurking in Hungary.

Before elaborating on the Hungarian crisis, please first present a contrary and unconfirmed piece of news: Recently, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky traveled between Berlin and Rome, which fully exposes Hungary's struggle for crisis; but there is also a rumor, roughly saying that Csáky, in view of the seriousness of the European situation, wants to use Hungary's relationship with Germany, as well as Hungary's relationship with Italy, Poland, and other countries, not belittling himself, and is determined to clarify the situation, so he travels for buffering, and travels for mediation; and praises him as a qualified and suitable middleman for the environment. Assuming that this piece of news can be accurately confirmed, then the so-called Hungarian crisis should be observed in another way. However, so far, there is insufficient information to confirm this piece of news, and the so-called Hungarian crisis cannot be concealed!

In Hitler's eyes, Hungary is a fish in a pot, meat on a chopping board. Originally, Hungary is a food exporting country and an industrial manufacturing product importing country. Hitler considered it Germany's raw material supply base: at the same time, Hungary's strategic position on the Danube is also extremely important. With it, it can directly control Yugoslavia and Romania, and can strengthen the encirclement of Poland. According to the Nazi Party map reprinted in the "Living Age" monthly magazine not long ago, the years of German aggression against small countries are drawn as follows: "Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938, Hungary in 1939, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria in 1940..." This is enough to explain how urgent the Hungarian crisis is!

Since Austria was incorporated into German territory, Hungary has become Germany's neighbor. The result of the Munich Agreement further plunged Hungary into a large encirclement. When Czechoslovakia was in crisis, Hungary, on the one hand, tried its best to flatter Germany, and on the other hand, took advantage of the fire to loot and extorted land from Czechoslovakia. Hitler generously gave it some, as if moving it from the right pocket to the left pocket. As a result, Hungary's population increased by 11.7 percent, and its territory increased by 13.3 percent. But on the other hand, it is no different from swallowing a sweet bait and falling into a trap; because the partition of Czechoslovakia caused at least four results in Hungary: (1) the growth of the domestic Nazi movement; (2) the Hungarian government tried its best to win Germany's friendship and became politically and economically dependent on the Axis; (3) imitating the domestic policies of Nazi Germany (such as anti-Semitism); (4) the Hungarian ruling class tried its best to oppose the intrusion of German forces. At that time, Hungarian Prime Minister Imrédy did not want to seek a way out. On the one hand, he adopted a pro-German policy in diplomacy, and on the other hand, he imitated Germany in domestic affairs to suppress the domestic Nazi movement. In other words, he attempted to offset the result of (1) by promoting the results of (2) and (3). At that time, Foreign Minister Kánya, who advocated understanding with the Little Entente, resigned and was replaced by the pro-Italian Csáky (C.Z'aKy). As soon as Csáky took office, he visited Berlin and decided to join the German-Italian Axis and the Anti-Comintern Pact. When Prime Minister Imrédy was discovered by Hitler to be of Jewish descent, he also resigned this spring. The successor to Imrédy is the current Prime Minister Teleki. Teleki continued to implement the previous policy, suppressing the domestic Nazi movement on the one hand, but rigorously implementing anti-Semitic policies on the other, in order to win Hitler's favor; this has continued until now, making Hungary gradually become a de facto vassal of Germany day by day.

The Hungarian authorities have a wrong plan, believing that Hungary must rely on Germany politically and economically. They believe that economically, without Germany, it would not be able to sell its surplus wheat; politically, without Germany, it would never be able to recover the lost territories in Romania and Yugoslavia. Hitler took advantage of this illusion and intensified his control over Hungary. He encouraged Hungary to demand Croatia from Yugoslavia and Outer Transylvania from Romania; the purpose of which everyone knows, is nothing more than using this method to win over Hungary; at the same time, creating some disturbances and manipulating the European situation; in order to establish his "new order" in Central Europe. The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind; the big shots of the Hungarian authorities are not confused and willing to be puppets; they think they are smarter than Hitler and use Hitler, using other people's power to build their own country; foreign power has been borrowed, lost land has not been returned, but step by step it has plunged today's Hungary into a deep abyss!

Now, under Hitler's threats and inducements, Hungary has finally reached the final moment of survival. According to British and French newspapers, when Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky recently visited Hitler, Hitler presented him with a "twenty-two article" ultimatum, pressuring Hungary to conclude a military alliance and suggesting a customs and monetary union. If these conditions are agreed to, Hungary will lose its territorial and sovereign independence and become a complete vassal of Germany. After these few days, it can be imagined that the so-called ultimatum is largely exaggerated; but there is no doubt that it is being subjected to pressure. The Hungarian authorities are wavering and have not yet made a firm and clear statement; Csáky went to Rome and traveled around, but he may not have obtained Mussolini's support. Because Germany and Italy have previously divided the spheres of influence in the Danube region and the Balkan Peninsula, and Hungary has been assigned to the German sphere; Hungary's national policy of "using Italy to control Germany" has long failed!

The Hungarian crisis is currently developing in parallel and intricately with the Danzig crisis!

### Large-Scale Reinforcements of Japanese Troops in Shenzhen; Closure of the Sino-British Border; Hong Kong Government Officials Express Lack of Concern; Japanese Troops Landing at Ao'tou Attempt to Invade Longgang and Huiyang

Hong Kong (1) For several days, the Japanese troops in Shenzhen have been reinforced by five large detachments, including 300 cavalry, all of Taiwanese origin. They began harassing activities again at 6:00 AM on the 21st and strictly prohibited residents from crossing the Sino-British border. (2) Yesterday morning, three people were shot and killed by Japanese troops for attempting to cross into British territory. (3) According to foreign news reports, Japanese troops landed again at Ao'tou in Bias Bay on the 20th and advanced towards Danshui. It is reported that they will advance in two routes, one to Longgang and one to Huiyang. (Telegram dated 21st)

Hong Kong The Japanese troops in Shenzhen are being heavily reinforced, all of them of Taiwanese origin. They are deploying in the Shatoujiao area of Shenzhen, implementing a blockade of the Sino-British border, and prohibiting refugees from passing. Many elderly people who tried to escape into British territory were shot and killed. (Special dispatch dated 21st)

Hong Kong Hong Kong government officials have expressed a lack of concern regarding the Japanese troops in Guangdong's declaration of a blockade of Hong Kong, stating that Hong Kong does not feel the threat of a blockade as a result of Japan's occupation of Shenzhen. Hong Kong's security and transportation lines all have comprehensive measures in place. It is also learned that the Japanese commander and British staff officers held a meeting to determine the precise border line of the New Territories. (Special dispatch dated 21st)

Hong Kong More than a thousand Japanese soldiers landed yesterday in two routes, occupying the Jiuru and Jiangjunshan areas near Xinhui and Muzhou. Another route occupied two small villages near Sanjiang Township. Currently, Chinese and Japanese troops are in a standoff. (Special dispatch dated 21st)

Hong Kong Border defenses in Hong Kong are consolidated. The Hong Kong authorities, fearing misunderstandings might arise due to the proximity of troops on both sides of the border and uncertainty regarding the Sino-British border, dispatched officials from the General Staff on the 20th to meet with the Japanese officer in charge to explain the situation. On the morning of the 21st, personnel were also sent to guide Japanese representatives on a tour of the border for recognition purposes. As for coastal defense, the Hong Kong authorities had previously deployed the ships "(Chan)" and "(E)" to defend Ma Shi Wan and Shenzhen Bay respectively. On the 21st, the ship "(Si Gao Te)" was deployed to replace the ship "(Chan)". (Telegram dated 21st)

Hong Kong Rumors are rampant, all stating that the Japanese are blockading Hong Kong. However, Reuters has confirmed that there are currently no actions to blockade Hong Kong, but there is a possibility of a blockade at any time. A Reuters reporter inspected the borders and found everything peaceful. During talks between British and Japanese staff officers at the end of last week, the British clearly indicated the border to the Japanese to avoid accidental incidents. At the same time, several small Japanese ships are docked at Nantou in the Pearl River Delta, unloading soldiers and food. In the future, when Hong Kong is blockaded, the Japanese may use these troops to blockade the border. Several residents who got up early this morning claimed to have seen many Japanese planes flying over the Hong Kong battery area above Davis Peak. However, the British military authorities do not acknowledge this. (Reuters telegram dated 21st)

Hong Kong Any Chinese entering British leased territory via Shatoujiao today must first obtain a special permit from the Japanese before being allowed to carry food to Kowloon. However, when questioned, Japanese authorities have denied blockading Hong Kong, saying that Chinese can apply for permits according to procedure if they wish. Also, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy in Hong Kong called the rumors of a blockade of Hong Kong "sheer nonsense." According to a certain spokesman for the Japanese Army, the sole purpose of the Japanese military operations near Hong Kong is to cut off the sources of Chinese military supplies. As for the extent of the blockade, they have not yet received information. Yesterday, a reporter went to the Kowloon border to observe the situation and learned that the area is currently peaceful. British flags are planted throughout the border area to indicate the British military's defensive line, and British soldiers are stationed in Shatoujiao and Luohe. Furthermore, the British military officer in charge of the border told the reporter that no disturbances had occurred in the past two days, Saturday and Sunday, and that the Japanese troops in Shatoujiao had not restricted Chinese from entering Kowloon. (Associated Press telegram dated 21st)

### Japanese Planes Viciously Bomb Yuanling and Chenxi

Chongqing This morning, a large number of Japanese bombers flew west from Hankou, appearing to be heading towards Chongqing for bombing, but instead of going up the river, they turned south and bombed Yuanling and Chenxi counties along the Changsha-Guiyang highway in northwestern Hunan Province. (Reuters telegram dated 21st)

Yuanling Twenty-seven Japanese planes invaded this area at noon on the 21st, indiscriminately bombing and dropping more than 200 bombs. The details of casualties are being investigated.

Ji'an Sixteen Japanese planes bombed Jishui and Shangrao in batches on the morning of the 21st. (Telegram dated 21st)

### Japanese Troops Ambushed Near Pinghu; None of the Hundred-Plus Soldiers Survive

Hong Kong Foreign news reports that 150 Japanese soldiers were ambushed near Pinghu on the morning of the 20th and were all killed by Chinese guerrillas without a single survivor. The Japanese troops in Pinghu rushed to reinforce them upon hearing the news, but the Chinese guerrillas had already retreated. (Telegram dated 21st)

### Chinese Troops in Central Hubei Recapture Yuanjiaji

Fancheng The Japanese troops in central Hubei have been frequently mobilized recently, making a show of force. Chinese troops continue to harass and strike at them, tiring out Japanese troop movements. Yuanjiaji near Qianjiang was thus recaptured by Chinese troops. A small number of Japanese troops in Suixian have been disturbing the area nearby, but after being attacked by Chinese troops, the Japanese troops fled back into the city. (Telegram dated 21st)

Yichang In the Tongshan area, Chinese troops have been engaged in fierce battles with Japanese troops for days, repelling Japanese troops attacking the key areas of Fenghuangshan and Hui'aoling (both south of Tongshan). Yesterday, more than a thousand Japanese troops from Sijiawan attacked the Chinese side again, but after a courageous counterattack, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were killed, and many spoils of war were seized. The battle is still ongoing. (Telegram dated 21st)

### Germany and the Soviet Union Sign a Commercial Credit Agreement; Germany Extends a Loan of 200 Million Marks; Stipulating the Value of Goods to be Purchased Within Two Years

Moscow After lengthy negotiations, the Soviet Union and Germany signed a commercial credit agreement in Berlin yesterday. The Soviet representative was Babarin, Deputy Trade Representative to Germany, and the German representative was Schnurre. The agreement stipulates that Germany should provide the Soviet Union with a credit loan of 200 million marks to be used for purchasing German goods within two years from the date of signing. The term of the credit loan is seven years with an annual interest rate of 5%. At the same time, Germany should purchase goods from the Soviet Union worth 180 million marks within two years. (TASS telegram dated 20th)

Berlin It is claimed here that the German-Soviet trade and loan agreement will revive German-Soviet trade, which has been dormant for many years. Business circles point out that the agreement stipulates that Germany will lend the Soviet Union 200 million marks, most of which will be used to purchase German machinery. At the same time, Germany will purchase raw materials from the Soviet Union such as timber, ore, petroleum, and cotton. It is said that the economic supply and demand of Germany and the Soviet Union are mutually adapted, which is the best factor in German-Soviet business relations. The Soviet Union has abundant resources and needs a large number of industrial products, such as machinery, to implement its "industrialization" plan, while Germany needs a large number of raw materials and agricultural products. The needs and supplies of the two countries complement each other. Therefore, German business circles believe that based on the above-mentioned excellent natural development of German-Soviet business relations, after the establishment of the commercial loan agreement, it will inevitably become brighter and more prosperous. (Haitong telegram dated 21st)

The Trade Figures of the Two Countries Are Expected to Increase as a Result

Berlin The commercial agreement signed between Germany and the Soviet Union is not much different from the commercial agreement of 1935. The amount of commercial credit loan granted by Germany to the Soviet Union in the next two years is still 200 million marks. The trade figures of both parties are expected to increase as a result. (This figure reached a huge 800 million marks at its peak, but has recently plummeted to 60 million marks.) Political figures all say that the establishment of the German-Soviet commercial agreement at this time is of great significance and can be regarded as satisfactory. A semi-official statement was issued stating that "Diplomatic relations between Germany and the Soviet Union can be strengthened internally. Germany is an industrial country, while the Soviet Union is rich in various raw materials. Therefore, Germany is an unlimited market for the Soviet Union. People in political and financial circles here believe that Germany's economic policy is extremely correct and can be clearly demonstrated by the German-Soviet agreement. In short, Germany will closely cooperate with all those who are willing to cooperate with Germany. This is the goal of Germany's economic policy." However, people in economic circles have a rather restrained attitude, saying that a confidant of General Göring, the dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, once made a statement in his private capacity, saying that Stalin is promoting socialism and striving for construction in the country, intending to make the most of the country's resources, so the various raw materials needed by Germany may not be exported in large quantities, and German-Soviet trade may not develop as a result. (Havas telegram dated 20th)

There is also Hope for Improvement in German-Soviet Political Relations

Moscow Editorials in the Izvestia and Pravda today both commented on the signing of the Soviet-German commercial credit agreement. Izvestia said, "Molotov, in his report on the international situation and Soviet foreign policy at the Second Plenary Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, stated, among other things, that negotiations on the German-Soviet commercial credit agreement were underway at the time. These negotiations were initiated by the German government, and have been going on since the beginning of 1938, except for a few breaks. Now they have reached a successful conclusion. We must point out that in the course of these lengthy negotiations, a few difficulties arose, the main reason being the tense atmosphere in the political relations between Germany and the Soviet Union. The fact that today's negotiations can be successfully concluded is because both sides expressed a full willingness to improve mutual commercial relations. As a result, all controversial issues can be resolved easily, and today's commercial credit agreement will inevitably make commodity trade between the two countries essentially more active. Further speaking, if we remember the fact that commodity trade between the Soviet Union and Germany has been particularly low in recent years, we can safely say that this new agreement will be a turning point in commercial relations between the two countries. In essence, due to the abnormality of political relations between the Soviet Union and Germany, Germany has actually lost the Soviet market. A few years ago, Germany still ranked first in the Soviet Union's foreign trade volume. For example, in 1931, when German-Soviet trade reached its highest level, the total trade volume between the two countries was 1.1 billion national marks. This favorable situation did not change until 1935. After that, due to the above-mentioned reasons, the situation changed abruptly. Germany quickly fell from the first place in the Soviet Union's foreign trade volume. By 1938, it was surpassed by the four countries of the United States, Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Germany's drop from first to fifth place in a huge and stable market like the Soviet Union naturally made the German business and industrial circles and the German government extremely concerned. The Soviet-German commercial credit agreement, which has just been signed in Berlin, contains the following: Germany provides the Soviet Union with a credit loan of 200 million national marks to be used by the Soviet Union to purchase various commodities in Germany, mainly machine tools and other equipment, within two years from the date of signing the agreement. During the same period, the Soviet Union should sell goods worth a total of 180 million national marks to Germany. The German government also assumes a number of obligations regarding this agreement. The most notable is that the German government promises to assist the Soviet Union's commercial representatives in Germany in ordering goods in the German market. In essence, the German government will assist our country's commercial representatives in negotiating with various merchants, so that our country can obtain favorable delivery conditions and machines and equipment of excellent quality. At the same time, in addition to giving Soviet representatives the opportunity to purchase goods with cash, the German government also fully guarantees that the credit loan to the Soviet Union should reach a total of 200 million national marks. This fact alone makes this new credit have the nature of financial credit. This is the essential difference between this new German credit and similar credit in the past, and this is not the only difference. The annual interest rate of the new credit is 5%, which is much lower than the interest rate of the past credit. The term of the new credit is also longer. Its average term is seven years, with 30% to be repaid in six and a half years, 40% in seven years, and the remaining 30% in seven and a half years. According to this, the commercial credit agreement signed in Berlin has also made essential progress in credit conditions, so that the entire Soviet-German trade should therefore be improved. It goes without saying that the essential improvement of such credit conditions is a necessary prerequisite for clearing all obstacles that have hindered the success of commercial credit agreements in the past. If there is no such progress, the Soviet Union will not agree to purchase goods in large quantities from Germany, nor will it accept credit loans from that country. As Molotov said in the aforementioned report, 'Today's Soviet Union is no longer the Soviet Union of ten or five years ago. We can expect that the new Soviet-German commercial credit agreement will essentially improve the economic relations between the two countries and effectively help to make commodity exchange between the two countries more active.' After describing the negotiation process and its contents of the agreement signed on August 19, the Pravda concluded: 'The new Soviet-German commercial credit agreement was produced in an atmosphere of tense political relations, which is enough to ease the atmosphere. The agreement may even improve not only the economic relations between the Soviet Union and Germany, but also political relations.'" (TASS telegram dated 20th)

German Newspapers Claim the Agreement Suits the German Economic Plan

Berlin After the German government announced the conclusion of the German-Soviet agreement, the Berlin newspapers all wrote articles commenting on it this morning. The tone is mostly the same. One, the Völkischer Beobachter, commented: "The German-Soviet commercial agreement is in line with the economic policies that Germany is currently promoting. Its purpose is to promote cooperative relations and increase trade volume. For a long time, German-Soviet trade relations have been quite poor. The Soviet Union is a country rich in raw materials, and Germany is a ready-made market for selling raw materials. The Soviet Union continues to promote its industrialization policy, and naturally purchases high-quality industrial products. Germany has previously supplied these products to the Soviet Union, and will continue to supply them in the future. After the two countries sign a new agreement, trade relations between the two countries will improve day by day, and both countries can reap economic benefits." (Haitong telegram dated 21st)

### German Minister of Economic Affairs Discusses the Current Economic Situation; Germany's Economic Equipment is Sufficient to Cope with War

Königsberg, Germany The East German Market Fair recently opened here. Langfeld, Minister of Economic Affairs, immediately gave a speech, criticizing certain countries for erecting barriers in the economy to hinder the development of German trade. The first section of the speech explained that Germany's economic equipment is extremely complete and sufficient to cope with war. Then he said that trade between Germany and the eastern countries has increased, which is gratifying. However, the commercial agreement that our country signed with Poland last year has not been implemented, which is not our fault. Germany has always believed that all issues between Germany and Poland can be resolved in a peaceful and rational manner. The conclusion of this agreement can be seen as proof of this. To this day, a certain country has provided credit loans with political conditions to other countries. This method is most likely to hinder the world economy, and the United States has raised import tariff rates at this time, making it impossible for German goods to be sold in the United States. Germany therefore has to take defensive measures. The United States is said to be willing to provide credit loans to Germany, but on the condition that we reduce our military spending and change our trade policy. In fact, National Socialist Germany is never willing to confuse national security with commerce, and we do not want to obtain credit loans. All we seek is to engage in trade on a reasonable basis.

Moscow The staff talks of the military delegations of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have resumed today after a three-day interruption. (Reuters telegram dated 21st)

Moscow The staff talks between the military representatives of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, which are being held here, have been interrupted for three days and have not yet shown signs of resuming. The British and French military representatives held a meeting on Sunday to consider the wording of the report to their governments on the reasons for the suspension of the talks. According to reliable sources, opinions differed, leading to the suspension of the talks. The truth about the differences is not yet known. However, at the end of this week, the official TASS news agency denied the claim that the Soviet Union demanded that Britain and France provide military assistance in the event of war in the Far East, and that Britain and France refused, leading to the interruption of the talks. (Reuters telegram dated 21st)

### Japanese and Soviet Troops Continue Artillery Battles on the Mongolian Border

Tokyo According to Japanese military news received here today, the two armies in the Manchu-Mongolian border area are facing each other across the Khalkhin Gol River. Although there are occasional small-scale engagements in various places, the border has been relatively calm for several days. However, since the early morning of Sunday, the Soviet-Mongolian allied forces suddenly began strong actions, and the entire border line has been tense again. At 3:00 PM today, the Kwantung Army Headquarters issued a communiqué summarizing the border situation since the 17th of this month, stating that the Soviet-Mongolian artillery fired artillery shells on the evening of the 17th. Therefore, the Japanese artillery retaliated and severely damaged three enemy artillery units. The communiqué mentioned air battles, saying that since the 17th, the Japanese Air Force has shot down 40 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft. At around 7:00 AM on Sunday, a Japanese Air Force unit fought with 10 Soviet aircraft in the sky over the Khalkhin Gol River, shooting down two of them. From 9:50 AM on Sunday, 70 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft began fighting with a Japanese Air Force unit in the sky at the confluence of the Khalkhin Gol River and the Hulsten River, lasting half an hour. As a result, the Soviet side lost 32 aircraft.

Berlin: As rumors spread widely abroad that Germany is exerting pressure on Hungary, the semi-official German News Agency recently denied this, saying, "Germany and Hungary, based on political, historical, and geographical factors, are jointly planning to adjust their political actions. This is true. However, the two countries have harmonious relations, and there is no discord whatsoever. Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky has also stated this." (Havas dispatch of the 21st)

### Czech People Resist German Oppression

Moscow Communication: The Pravda recently published a Czech communication, stating, "The fascist invaders who have invaded Czechoslovakia are constantly and everywhere facing resistance from the freedom-loving Czech people. The Czech people, unafraid of unprecedented terror and oppression, are striving for national liberation. The harsh rule of Germany in Czechoslovakia first aims to suppress the national consciousness of Czech patriots, forcibly Germanizing the cultural, political, and economic life of the Czech people. Czech schools have all been closed and replaced with German schools, as has the Czech National Theater. German has been declared the national language. Czech-produced meat, butter, bread, and other foods are mostly plundered, transported to Germany daily by large numbers of trains and trucks, so that Czech people may starve to death this winter. Even now, there is no meat, butter, or sweet potatoes for sale in the markets, and general food prices have increased by 30 to 35 percent since the occupation. Wage increases for laborers are explicitly prohibited. 150,000 Czech workers have been forcibly sent to various places to build defensive fortifications. The entire Czech Republic has been rapidly transformed into a battlefield for attacking Poland, Romania, and Hungary, preparing to inflict the same fate on the people of these three countries as on the Czechs and Slovaks. The first step will be an attack on Poland. However, no matter how hard the fascists try to transform democratic Czechoslovakia into a fascist base, the Czech people's 'passive resistance' is turning into active struggle. Czech patriots are now everywhere organizing secret groups, engaging in publishing magazines, and uniting forces for an anti-fascist national movement. At the same time, it is reported in the newspapers that German army transportation lines are constantly being destroyed by the Czech people." (TASS dispatch of the 20th)

### Chinese Tung Oil Sales in the U.S. Still Increasing

(New Aviation Communication) Although the transportation of Chinese tung oil to the United States is becoming increasingly difficult and market prices are rising daily, the number of sales from April to June this year has increased by 14.5 percent compared to the same period last year. Although the number of substitutes used in the United States has increased, it is still insufficient to affect tung oil sales. For example, although the use of linseed oil has increased by 11 percent, perilla oil has increased by 23 percent, and castor oil has increased by 40 percent, it is still not comparable to the increasing use of tung oil. (The impact of castor oil on tung oil sales is not yet visible in the statistics.) As for tung oil inventories, the number at the end of March was 53,712,099 pounds, which had decreased to 41,010,968 pounds by the end of June. The difference is significant. If this continues, there will be a shortage in the second half of this year. However, if China's undeveloped highways can be utilized to increase exports, then the situation would be different. As for the market price of tung oil, although the use of various substitutes has increased, the market price of tung oil is still very firm. Responsible parties here believe that the tung oil used from April to June was purchased at previously lower prices. (Havas dispatch of the 21st)

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Prevents Floods

A certain place in Northern Jiangsu: In order to prevent the convergence of the Yellow River, Huai River, Yi River, and Grand Canal waters from flooding the counties along the Li-Xia River in Northern Jiangsu, the Jiangsu Provincial Government is not only rushing to repair the Grand Canal levee, but also rapidly seeking to dredge waterways to the sea and opening up outlets. Staff were dispatched to survey the six ports returning to the sea. Except for Sheyang Port, which is still occupied by the Japanese, and Chuanqian Port, which has little siltation, and Doulong Port, which was dredged this spring with smooth flow, the remaining ones urgently need dredging and straightening, including Xinyang Port, Wang Port, and Zhu Port, three major projects, and the opening of diversion rivers, including the Zi, Wu, Mao, and You canals in the Si Liaozi, Southern Border, and Reclamation areas, to aid in drainage. Acting Chairman Han has ordered the Coastal Waterway Engineering Committee and the Northern Jiangsu Grand Canal Engineering Bureau to quickly draft construction plans and has telegraphed the Central Government, requesting a prompt allocation of 300,000 yuan in subsidies to start construction.

### German Political Circles Declare Determination to Settle Old Scores with Poland, Believe Action Against Poland is Necessary in Law and Reason, Britain and France Determined to Fulfill Obligation to Stop Aggression

Berlin: Semi-official circles here recently declared that the various demands made by Germany will certainly be quickly satisfied. Rumors that the Tannenberg Memorial Ceremony and the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress on the 27th of this month will be cancelled are all unfounded. Germany has also not made a full military occupation of Slovakia. In addition, although Germany and Hungary maintain close relations, no military alliance has been formed. All newspapers also strongly assert that Germany will certainly obtain satisfaction. However, political figures say that the current issue is not limited to the Free City of Danzig. Germany must settle old scores with Poland, because Poland's position is the same as that of Czechoslovakia last year. In other words, it is the center of resistance to Germany's eastward expansion policy, which Germany cannot tolerate. Once the fortress constructed by Poland is flattened, the political and economic reorganization of Eastern and Southeastern Europe can proceed smoothly without resorting to war. In addition, Poland is the weakest in the encirclement and occupies the most important position. Therefore, Germany's actions against Poland are necessary in both law and "reason." Even if this leads to war with Poland, it is not to be feared. Fortunately, this war will certainly end quickly, and Western European countries will not be able to intervene in time. In addition, the German-Soviet trade agreement has been established, indicating that the Soviet Union will remain neutral in wartime. (Havas dispatch of the 21st)

New York: The Republican New York Volkszeitung recently commented on the European situation with a pessimistic tone, saying, "If the democratic countries do not make concessions, then German leader Hitler has only two paths to follow: one is to retreat, which is a great disgrace that he can never endure; the other is to start a war. Among the two, which way to go must be chosen within a day or two and cannot be delayed any longer. However, if Hitler decides to take a desperate gamble, he may suffer unfavorable consequences and will not be able to succeed for long, or he may have to admit failure at the last minute. In short, the peace and order of Europe have been disturbed by major crises for several years. The current crisis is undoubtedly the most serious. The outcome will be seen within a few days."

Free City of Danzig: Rumors that the chairman of the Danzig Senate, Greiser, held a meeting with the Polish High Commissioner, Chodacki, and the League of Nations High Commissioner, Burckhardt, yesterday were denied by well-informed sources here, who also said that they did not know whether Burckhardt would go to Germany again to meet with German leader Hitler next week. (Havas dispatch of the 20th)

Berlin: As Sunday has passed peacefully, the international situation has not worsened. Although news of Polish atrocities is still published in newspapers, the space occupied is less than in the past few days, and the newspapers' intense criticism has also decreased. Warsaw yesterday issued an article by the official news agency, earnestly denying the German newspapers' claims of anti-German atrocities and terrorist activities occurring within Poland, calling them purely fabricated, aimed at stirring up anti-Polish sentiment among Germans. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)

London: The Times diplomatic correspondent said that the Germans have now launched a propaganda campaign aimed at creating doubts among small countries that hope Britain and France will adopt a strong policy. In fact, Britain and France are determined to actively fulfill their obligation to stop aggression, even if it means going to war. This is the principle of British and French foreign policy and has not changed to this day. The fact is clear and is the best answer to this kind of German propaganda. The British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, recently visited German Foreign Ministry official Weizsäcker, the purpose of which was to reiterate this principle. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)

### Poland Mobilizes Troops to Strengthen Western Defenses

Warsaw: The Polish government is conscripting soldiers of all levels of the reserve army, and a large number of specialists and technicians have been called up. Government officials have not made any public announcements about this. In fact, many doctors, dentists, and technicians in Warsaw have been conscripted. Various large-scale public works projects, such as the new railway station in the capital, have had to be postponed due to some technicians and specialized workers being incorporated into special army units. As for Poland's current military strength, since Germany took back the Memel area in March of this year, the authorities have conscripted two levels of the reserve army. In recent weeks, although a portion of the reserve army has been given leave to return to the fields for the autumn harvest, it has been supplemented by other levels of the reserve army. In total, the regular army currently has 800,000 men. All copper smelters in the country are rushing to fulfill government orders, so that the fortifications around the western border and Danzig can be stepped up and completed in a short period of time. As for the frequent troop movements rumored outside, it is difficult to know the details. However, according to well-informed sources, a certain number of troops were dispatched from here to Poznań. The reason for this is that after the Soviet and Polish authorities recently decided to reduce the number of border guards in the border area, the Polish authorities were able to withdraw troops to strengthen the western defenses. This is the actual situation. In addition, the Polish government has also taken various new economic measures. All factories related to national defense have been ordered to stockpile various raw materials, so that they can continue production for several weeks after the outbreak of war. Employees of all institutions and large enterprises have been paid in advance to store food, so that civilian families will not be short of food within two weeks after the start of the war. The postal and public transport agencies, because some staff will be mobilized in wartime, have prepared to employ women and plan to recall retired staff to replace them. The authorities of major cities are now drafting evacuation plans for residents. Residents along the coast and the Polish Corridor have reportedly been advised by the authorities to move inland to the extent that their occupations permit. (Havas dispatch of the 21st)

### Forster Declares Danzig Will Return to Germany

Danzig: Danzig Nazi Party leader Forster delivered a speech last night, saying that Hitler will immediately resolve the Danzig issue peacefully. He said, "The time for Danzig to return to Germany has come. We await the leader's actions." Forster avoided saying the date of the annexation but warned Britain and France not to interfere, saying, "Britain and France should already know that threatening Hitler on the Czech issue did not work." Forster also said, "If Poland had accepted Germany's demands in October last year and March this year, Germany would not have made demands on the 'Corridor' today." Every resident of Danzig feels this tense atmosphere and knows that a great storm is coming. The situation cannot be deadlocked any longer. (Associated Press dispatch of the 21st)

### Impact of International Situation on the London Market

London: The recent developments in the international situation have caused all sectors of London to reconvene at the end of the week with a very solemn will. Wheat prices recently rose sharply by half a penny to three pence due to statistics, which is perhaps the best symbol of the general sentiment. The stock exchange is on the verge of stagnation. Traders find it difficult to obtain prices. The prices of all items are trending downward. Market participants are cautious and unwilling to buy, and they are very reluctant to express opinions on the future price trends. Among the top securities, war bonds fell by one pound, and other securities all saw sharp declines. At the same time, there is very little selling pressure in the market, which is an exciting feature. The public generally hopes that the current international tension will last, but both professional and public investors will remain calm. As for the wheat market, its activity is entirely due to the international situation. In addition, metals such as copper and lead are still being eagerly purchased. In the foreign exchange market, the Europeans are frantically buying US dollars, putting considerable pressure on the British pound. However, the British Equalization Fund has come forward to maintain it, and the exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar remains unchanged. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)

### Three Japanese Planes Bombing Jiading and Other Places Shot Down by Chinese Army, Two-Thirds of Jiading Destroyed by Fire, Over Two Thousand Innocent People Killed and Injured, Chongqing Sends Planes Carrying Doctors for Rescue

Chongqing: Jiading County, Sichuan Province, was heavily bombed by Japanese planes last Saturday (19th). Due to the interruption of communications, the authorities here were unable to assess the extent of the damage to the entire city of Jiading for a while. According to the China National Aviation Corporation, two-thirds of Jiading County, including the commercial district, was completely destroyed by fire. The fire has been burning since Saturday and has not been extinguished as of yesterday. The American Methodist Church in Jiading, although the fire spread to the outside, was fortunately not burned down. Many missionary residences along the Yangtze River may have been destroyed or have already been burned down. People here believe that the Japanese authorities mistakenly believed the Japanese Wireless Telegraph broadcast on Friday that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had moved his headquarters to Jiading, so they sent planes to bomb it. Although a small number of Chinese government agencies moved to Jiading and other places in January and February of this year, according to Chinese reports, Chiang Kai-shek happened to be in Chongqing on that day, and Chiang had presided over the first graduation ceremony for Boy Scout trainers in Chongqing on Sunday morning. According to Chinese sources, there were no military targets in Jiading City, so the Japanese planes carried out this bombing "due to being deceived by fabricated intelligence." It is said that Chinese fighter planes shot down three Japanese planes over the north bank of the Yangtze River. In addition, the American community in Western China chartered a plane on Sunday to send two doctors and two nurses from the New Life Movement to Jiading to rescue the injured people. (Associated Press dispatch of the 21st)

Chongqing: The fire in Jiading that started due to the Japanese air raid on Saturday was still not extinguished when a Chongqing relief plane carrying doctors and nurses arrived there yesterday. Jiading City is built at the foot of Mount Emei, 180 miles west of Chongqing. From the air, two-thirds of the city seems to have been destroyed by indirect bombing, that is, the fire after the bombing. The city gates of Jiading have recently been enlarged to make it easier for residents to evacuate during air raids. Details of the Japanese planes' rampage on Saturday have not yet been received here, but it is said that there were many civilian casualties. There are no medical facilities there, so the government chartered a plane to send doctors and medicines to provide relief. If necessary, another relief plane will fly to Jiading tomorrow. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)

Chongqing: The US Embassy in China received a report this morning from the Reverend Snyder of the Yüanling American Christian Church in Western Hunan, stating that a team of Japanese planes heavily bombed the Yüanling American Church last Friday (18th), burning down two chapels and destroying all church property. The 20 Americans residing in Yüanling were spared. It is estimated that in the past five months, including the property of the Yüanling Church, more than forty pieces of American church property have been bombed by Japanese planes. (Associated Press dispatch of the 21st)

Chongqing: According to Chinese officials today, as a result of Japanese planes bombing Jiangjin, Jiading, Luzhou, and Zhuliuzhen (transliteration) in Sichuan on Saturday, more than 2,000 innocent civilians were killed and injured. (Associated Press dispatch of the 21st)

Chongqing: After the Japanese planes bombed Jiading on Saturday, two doctors and two nurses were sent by plane to rescue the injured. Among the companions was an American from the American Red Cross. It is said that one-third of Jiading has been bombed, and the commercial area has been razed to the ground. The population of Jiading is 60,000. Foreigners estimate that more than 500 people were killed and injured in this Japanese bombing, while Chinese estimate that more than 1,000 people were killed. In addition, the Canadian church and its affiliated hospital were destroyed by fire, with losses of more than thousands of US dollars. Although Wuhan University was not hit, its dormitory was bombed, killing nine students. It is also said that a refugee camp run by Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, was also bombed, but there were no deaths or injuries. Two Chinese doctors from the Canadian church hospital have been buried in the rubble. Fortunately, all the foreigners in Jiading were summering on Mount Emei, 35 miles away, and were not injured. However, they all saw the great fire in Jiading that night. The Japanese planes bombed Jiading with 36 planes, which took turns dropping bombs, and then flew to the summer resort of foreigners on Mount Emei and dropped a bomb, but there was no loss. It is said that the great fire in Jiading is still burning today. However, two China National Aviation Corporation planes parked in the Minjiang River were not hit. This Japanese bombing of Jiading was the first time, so the casualties were very heavy due to lack of experience. Many houses were burned down. The International Red Cross has sent people with 1,000 yuan in cash and medical supplies to provide relief, and it is said that they plan to send another 1,000 yuan.

### Self-Confessed Assailants in the Cheng Murder Case Send Another Letter to a Certain Important Person, Attaching Fingerprints, Already Transferred to the Hong Kong Government

Hong Kong: It was learned today that after the two men who confessed to being the murderers in the Cheng murder case in Tianjin sent letters to Reuters and various Chinese newspapers here, they did not see any action, and sent another letter to a certain important Chinese person, confessing to the crime of murder. At the end of the letter, in addition to the signatures of the two men, there were also fingerprints, saying that if these fingerprints are compared with the fingerprints stored in the Tianjin British Police Department, it can be proved that everything said by the two is true. The two men have repeatedly stated that if they are guaranteed not to be handed over to the Japanese, they are willing to surrender to the Hong Kong government. The Chinese person who received the letter has submitted the letter to the Hong Kong government, and it is now heard that the Hong Kong government is currently discussing the disposal methods with the British government.

### Linjin: Puppet Troops Revolt

Shan County: Yao Xilai's puppet troops stationed in Linjin, with more than 800 men, have long been thinking of defecting, but they had no opportunity due to strict Japanese surveillance. On the 15th, when the Chinese army attacked Linjin, all of the puppet troops suddenly revolted, responding from within and without, killing many Japanese soldiers. Now the troops have been reorganized by the Chinese side and are ready to kill the enemy. (Dispatch of the 21st)

### Chen Jitang Declares Support for National Policy

Hong Kong: An Associated Press reporter interviewed Chen Jitang, who is living in seclusion in Kowloon, today. According to him, "In July 1936, the reason for my opposition to the central government was due to resistance against Japan. From that time until today, my views and attitudes have not changed at all. In other words, I firmly support the war of resistance to the end until we obtain the freedom of the nation and the country. Moreover, for two years, the government has been effectively resisting the war, and the final victory is already in sight. How can I go back on my own policy that I have always advocated and oppose myself?" When the reporter asked whether he sympathized with Wang Jingwei's movement, Chen denied that this kind of speculation underestimated his personality. "Those who are not enemies of the united front against Japan will never fabricate this rumor. Wang Jingwei's pro-Japanese tendency was already evident during his tenure as President of the Executive Yuan. Unfortunately, after the start of the war of resistance, the government failed to eliminate him." The reporter then asked whether Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had telegraphed him to go to Chongqing. Chen replied, "Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek did send a telegram ordering me to go to Chongqing, but because my wife is currently ill, I have to postpone it before I can go to pay my respects to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek." He also said that his and the Generalissimo's grievances had been completely dispelled since the Sino-Japanese war broke out, and that at that time, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek would consult him on Guangdong's military affairs every day. The reporter asked whether he had donated a large sum of money to the government. Chen replied, "I have transferred 7 million yuan to the national government, but this is the people's donation for the war of resistance, not my personal funds." Chen believes that the Soviet Union has decisive power in the Far East, so he advocates closer cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. "When I was in France, the then Prime Minister Léon Blum expressed his willingness to mediate and promote a military alliance between China and the Soviet Union." Chen continued, "China will surely win the final victory. The heroic spirit of China fighting the Japanese army for two years has been seen by the world. Although China still has many difficulties in the future, it is more unified internally than ever before, so the war of resistance against Japan will be able to exert its strength even more in the future."

### A European Problem: Danzig is the Gateway to Continental Europe, Not Just a Matter Between Germany and Poland (Translated from the "字林西報" [North-China Daily News])

World opinion largely mistakenly believes the Danzig problem is merely an issue between Poland and Germany. Even the public opinion of countries belonging to the so-called "peace front" largely thinks this way. Regarding this impending conflict, most public opinion indeed supports Poland, but generally recognizes it as a conflict between Germany and Poland. Whatever solution is found, it is considered to only have truly significant implications for Germany and Poland. All discussions and various speculations regarding the Danzig situation are based on this viewpoint. However, this reasoning is very flawed and only proves that Western Europeans and overseas individuals fail to clearly understand the real nature of the Danzig problem. One must know that the conflict arising from Danzig involves Germany and Poland only to a very minor extent. In reality, it is a pan-European problem with a very broad scope and influence, perhaps determining the final shape of the map of Europe, the balance of power, and the future destiny of the European continent.

If Germany were to acquire Danzig, it could extremely threaten Poland in the Baltic Sea, virtually isolating Poland from the sea and, at least economically, perhaps also militarily, destroying Poland's independence. This situation would ultimately deprive Poland of its freedom of action in domestic affairs and prevent it from freely choosing any political system to which it could belong. Once Germany occupies Danzig, it can completely cut off Poland's narrow access to the sea at any time, and can also forcibly steer Poland onto the path of the German political system. Once Germany politically dominates Poland, a nation of 35 million people, its dream of dominating Europe can be realized. Consequently, the countries of the Baltic Sea, the countries of Scandinavia, Romania, and the Balkan territories will all be under German hegemony, and the actual population of "Greater Germany" will increase from 86 million to 180 million. As for the aforementioned countries, whether they are all annexed (like Bohemia and Moravia) or left with a hollow independence while being completely controlled by Germany in economic, political, and military terms, there is fundamentally no difference between the two.

Danzig already faces the theoretical possibility of being annexed into Germany, and Poland already faces the possibility of being controlled by Germany in economic and military terms. This threat has already loomed over the heads of other countries. Now, let's explain the nature of this threat. Let's start with Romania. First, it must be understood that the alliance between Poland and Romania is by no means a fabrication or the result of some transient situation, but rather a clear political expression that binds the two countries inseparably. It is a geopolitical bond that unites the two countries. In fact, Poland and Romania are the two major elements of the Baltic-Black Sea axis, and this axis is born from the great axis extending from the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The port systems of the two countries are one of the greatest symbols of this cooperation. Constanța in Romania can be said to be Poland's southern port, while Danzig-Gdynia in Poland can be said to be Romania's northern port. Therefore, if Germany seizes Danzig, it will isolate Poland from the sea and pull it into the German economic and political system. If so, wouldn't the independence of Romania and other Balkan countries be immediately affected? At that time, Germany will naturally use its enormous military power to crush the smaller Balkan countries. Even setting aside military power, it is evidently very doubtful that the Balkan countries will be able to communicate with the northern European seas at that time. Thus, their economies will all depend on Germany's breath. It must be known that Germany's economic power is already very large now. One more point must be remembered: economic independence is somewhat related to political independence. Once economic independence is lost, political independence cannot be preserved either.

Now let's turn to the Baltic and Scandinavian countries. The situation here is relatively simple. Let's again assume that Danzig has been annexed into Germany and Poland has been driven away from the sea. This, of course, means that all political problems in the general Baltic Sea area have come to an end, and the fortress line connecting Memel-Königsberg-Danzig-Stettin will rise, with Danzig as the central fortress. To the north is "old Germanic" Scandinavia, its ports threatened by the "laws" of new Germany's "need for free development" and "living space." German merchant ships, now idle for 60 percent, will initiate a suitable transportation policy to find business for these ships. Germany's "living space" will expand dramatically and unhindered based on the Memel-Königsberg-Danzig-Stettin line in the Baltic Sea and even further afield. Other countries will lose the possibility of pursuing their own navigation policies because of this battlefront. Thus, the Baltic Sea economy of the Scandinavian countries will be excluded from the port of Danzig. These countries have a crucial relationship with the Danzig problem. Their flags occupy the top position among ships entering and leaving the port of Danzig. At that time, Danzig will be reduced to the status of a third-class city in a province, and just like before the World War when it was not incorporated into the Polish customs area, its only use will be as a naval base by Germany, controlling the development of German interests in the Baltic Sea and constantly threatening Northern Europe.

However, some may ask, does the annexation of Danzig into Germany necessarily equal cutting Poland off from the sea? Does such a cutoff indeed make Poland an economic and military vassal of Germany? The answer to both questions is definitely yes, for the following reasons:

First of all, we must know that there is no autonomous Danzig problem at present, only the problem of the Danzig-Gdynia port complex. These two ports complement each other, jointly forming the only shipping gateway for a nation of 35 million people in the Polish Republic to interact with the outside world. Although there is still a narrow strip of land several miles long between Danzig and Gdynia today that has not been built up, this cannot change the aforementioned fact. If the two ports continue to develop at the same rate as in the past, the two cities will be integrated together in the near future. Danzig itself is not enough to meet the needs of a country of 35 million people with extremely great economic drive. This is why Gdynia was established. Gdynia excellently complements the tasks provided by Danzig. The annual import and export volume passing through these two ports accounts for more than 80% of Poland's foreign trade, nearly 20 million tons. Part of Poland's foreign trade passes through Danzig, while another part takes the route through Gdynia. Therefore, the two ports seem to be organizationally linked and work together in theory as a single economic system. Today, Gdynia cannot do without Danzig, and Danzig cannot do without Gdynia. From a geopolitical perspective, Danzig is within Poland, located at the mouth of the Vistula River. This river is more than 650 miles long, flows through Polish territory, and is Poland's only access to the sea. The area of Poland is a total of 151,000 square miles, and the Vistula River basin accounts for 46 percent, totaling 69,500 square miles. Therefore, it is easy to imagine the tragic consequences for Poland if Germany can incorporate the mouth of the Vistula River into its territory. Poland's land border is approximately 3,450 miles long, and its coastline is only 85 miles long, accounting for 2.5 percent of Poland's total border. Germany's coastline accounts for 22.6 percent of its border, and France's coastline accounts for half of its border. 80% of Poland's foreign trade passes through this 2.5% of coastline. Land routes have so far been mostly used for trade with Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Among these territories, Austria and Czechoslovakia have been annexed by Germany, and Hungary has become a country economically closely dependent on Germany. So, if Germany drives Poland away from the Baltic Sea, then more than 90% of Poland's foreign trade will fall under Germany's control. Isn't this equivalent to Poland losing its economic independence? In this way, Poland will be economically annexed by Germany.

The political aspects of the event should also be examined. Even before the annexation of Czechoslovakia, Poland's border with Germany was already the longest among its neighboring countries, totaling 1,187 miles, accounting for 34.5% of Poland's land border. Bohemia and Moravia have been annexed, and Slovakia has been included in Germany's "Central Europe" system. Today, Poland's border with Germany and countries directly under German influence totals 1,802 miles, accounting for more than half of Poland's land border. After Germany annexed the Memel region, the Lithuanian border can no longer be considered completely independent either. The Soviet border—accounting for a quarter of Poland's total border—is essentially lifeless. Currently, only two sections of Poland's border are truly independent and active: (1) the border with Romania, which is an indirect outlet to the Black Sea, and (2) the Baltic coast (that is, the Danzig-Gdynia complex), which is an open gateway to the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, Scandinavia, England, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the entire vast world. Closing this gateway is equivalent to immediately strangling Poland.

Perhaps some may say that the annexation of Danzig into Germany does not necessarily mean that Poland will lose Gdynia at the same time. At first glance, it may seem so, but it is not. Because at that time, German warships will be docked in the port of Danzig, the city of Danzig will be garrisoned by German troops, and heavy artillery will be erected on the coast of Danzig. Then, is the independence of Gdynia, only a few miles away, over? The significance of this point must be properly understood. As we already know, if Danzig is annexed into Germany, Poland will lose its true economic, political, and military independence, and Germany will be able to dominate the entire region of Europe between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. This is not only a great danger to Poland but also to all of Europe. For this reason, neither Poland nor all of Europe can allow Germany to realize its plans for this.

### Transportation Industry on the Yunnan-Burma Road: More Than 200 Transportation Companies, Making Huge Profits Due to Rising Prices

Kunming Correspondence: After the coastal trading ports of China were completely blockaded by Japanese warships, the economic center of gravity shifted to the Southwest. The Chinese authorities actively developed transportation routes in the southwestern provinces, such as the Sichuan-Yunnan, Guizhou-Yunnan, and Guangxi-Yunnan trunk highways, which have been completed one after another. Kunming in Yunnan Province is the transportation hub center. There are two external transportation routes for Kunming: (1) the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which runs directly from Kunming to Haiphong in Vietnam. This railway was built more than 20 years ago, but the tracks are simple and the carrying capacity is also weak. After the Guangdong-Hankou and Guangzhou-Kowloon railways were blocked, goods from Hong Kong turned to Haiphong, and were transported to Kunming via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and then transferred to the southwestern provinces. However, due to the insufficient capacity of the vehicles, goods were piled up like hills, which was not enough to meet the needs of the times. (2) the Yunnan-Burma Road, from Kunming to Rangoon. The railway tracks on this road are currently being built day and night, but the entire line is 700 miles long, and its completion time will take two years. Currently, the only thing that can be used for transportation is the newly built Yunnan-Burma Highway. The entire journey from Rangoon to Kunming by car takes five days to reach. Recently, car transportation has been crowded, and there are 500 to 600 trucks traveling on this route every day. The prosperity of its transportation can be imagined. After all vehicles and goods are transported to Kunming, most of them are transferred to Chongqing or Guiyang, and fewer are transferred to Guangxi. The import and export of goods in Guangxi Province, in addition to using the Yunnan-Vietnam and Yunnan-Burma roads for transportation, also have the ports of Beihai and Guangzhouwan for transshipment. Since Kunming is the center of commercial and cargo transportation, there are as many as 200 transportation operators. Among them, the most magnificent transportation companies are Southwest Company, Zhongxing Company, and Lianyun Company. These three companies are all organized by some dignitaries, specializing in the import and export of goods, so the hardware, equipment, raw materials, and transportation vehicles needed by the government and agencies in the southwestern provinces are all contracted and transported by these three companies, so the monthly profits are incalculable. The transportation vehicles of other companies are either grouped by two or three hundred vehicles, or grouped by three or several vehicles. However, regardless of the size of the company, it must have a part of military or political power as its background to be able to operate without hindrance. Otherwise, all vehicles, if not seized by powerful people, will also be borrowed by agencies, only to see their own losses.

Since the beginning of summer this year, prices in Kunming have soared particularly sharply compared to last winter. According to a survey by an economic expert on sixteen kinds of daily necessities, compared to last winter's prices, the prices of eight items such as rice, flour, pork, matches, firewood, chicken, charcoal, and lard have increased by 150% to 200%.

The prices of three items such as salt, white cloth, and sauces have increased by 100% to 150%. The prices of three items such as soap, eggs, and coal have increased by 100% to 200%. Kerosene has increased by 50%, and white sugar has increased by 250%. In addition, toothbrushes are priced at 1.2 yuan each, and towels are priced at 8 jiao to 1 yuan each. The high price of other imported goods is astonishing. Chongqing and Guiyang are even more expensive than Kunming. All companies that have goods to transport to the interior make profits, with some earning multiple times over. The reason there are so many transportation companies is probably because demand still exceeds supply. Some small-capital merchants, either forming a small company jointly with two or three people, or investing and organizing independently, buy one or two trucks in Hong Kong, and after loading them with goods and driving them into Kunming or Chongqing from Rangoon, sell both the goods and the trucks together and return with the money, and then do a second business. Such a rotational cycle also earns ten times the profit, but it must rely on the protection of powerful people in the local area.

### Japanese Troops in Fengxian Disguised for Action

Fengxian Correspondence: The number of Japanese troops entrenched in Fengxian is not large. The Chinese guerrillas attack from time to time, causing considerable losses. Therefore, they have recently changed their plans in an attempt to deal with them. According to reliable information, the Japanese troops suddenly dispatched a team from Minhang on the 18th to cross the river and concentrate in Zhangang, heading straight for Xuliqiao in the county. Another unit, consisting of five or six hundred people, departed from Nanhui and other places at the same time. They looted old and tattered clothes from farmers along the way, dressed in them, completely shaved off their specially marked beards, wore straw sandals, and disguised themselves as farmers. A part of them wore mixed-color uniforms and pretended to be guerrillas. There were also forty or fifty older ones who dressed up as peddlers, carrying baskets on their shoulders, speaking local dialects, and hawking, in various forms. All guns were carried with them, mostly wrapped in straw mats and newspapers. When the advance armed team arrived at Xuliqiao, they immediately came out from all sides, passing through Jinhuiqiao, Qianjiaqiao, Qingcungang, and heading to Nanqiao, deceiving the villagers along the way, inquiring about information. The search in the Qingcungang area was particularly strict. The team disguised as peddlers was the most active, selling daily necessities in the villages at low prices. The villagers, greedy for small profits, were easily exploited. They also distributed money, flowers, candies, and other things to women and children, enticing them in every way. Fortunately, the guerrillas had received information and cleaned up in advance, leaving no traces to be found. The masses, thanks to effective daily propaganda, also recognized them. They harassed for three days, but in the end gained nothing.

### Japanese and Puppet Regime in Suzhou Control Commodity Transportation

Suzhou Correspondence: The Japanese Special Service Agency, under the pretext of regulating the material economy in various places, established the Suzhou Material Exchange. Suzhou people, including Lu Xushuang, were appointed as puppet directors to control the transportation and sale of goods by merchants and civilians, monopolizing transportation in order to carry out its plundering methods. Since the establishment of the puppet Material Exchange, all permits and transportation certificates have been cancelled. Goods are not allowed to be sold to foreign merchants and are directly controlled by the agency. No third party is allowed to operate, especially Shanghai merchants, because the current foreign exchange rate, if the goods are sold to foreign merchants, can yield several times the pure profit, which is why the Japanese are jealous.

### Shanghai West Incident: Shanghai Municipal Council Considers Action, Unwilling to Engage with the Puppet Regime to Avoid Setting a Bad Precedent; the Puppet "Municipal Government" Lodges a Protest and Receives Japanese Support

Chuan Xiao'an, the puppet "Mayor," supported behind the scenes by the Japanese army, submitted a written protest to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday. It included four demands: (1) Punish the person who fired the shots and others responsible; (2) Report the method and process of punishment to the "Mayor of the Shanghai Special Municipality"; (3) Compensate the losses of the deceased; and (4) Apologize to the "Mayor of the Shanghai Special Municipality" and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. The protest was released at a Japanese reception for journalists last night. At the same time, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy issued a statement saying that due to this shooting incident, the anti-British movement would expand further in China. The puppet mayor's protest also stated that this shooting incident was a complete violation of the Tokyo-Craigie-Arita Agreement and made strong and threatening demands, such as the Shanghai Municipal Council returning police power on the roads built beyond the boundary, as this police power was illegally obtained by the Shanghai Municipal Council. At the same time, the spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated his "personal opinion" that the Japanese authorities believe that the responsibility and error primarily lie with the Shanghai Municipal Council police. According to the spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy, this letter of request seems quite reasonable, and the Japanese side cannot but support it.

The Shanghai Municipal Council Decides to Temporarily Not File a Protest

According to the North-China Daily News, reliable sources heard last night (the 20th) that the Shanghai Municipal Council is currently studying the shooting incident on Great Western Road on Saturday and Sunday evenings and will not send out a protest for the time being because they do not know to whom to send this protest. On this point, it is heard that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the British military authorities previously lodged protests with the Japanese army, navy, and diplomatic authorities regarding issues such as the establishment of gambling dens and opium dens in the Western District, as well as the gathering of a large number of armed thugs, but the Japanese authorities repeatedly refused to consider them.

Unwilling to Engage with the Puppet Regime

The reason is that these areas are under the responsibility of the "Reformed Government" Standing Committee, so all protests must be sent to the "Reformed Government" authorities. On the other hand, the Shanghai Municipal Council has not yet established relations with the "government" supported by the Japanese side and feels that initiating this relationship with a protest is of no value. However, in this regard, it is heard that the Shanghai Municipal Council has received many protests from the "Great Way" government regarding the transfer of the Public Concession court and sent a letter to the "Great Way" government two days ago in response to the recent protest. This is the first time the Shanghai Municipal Council has sent a letter to the government since the establishment of the "Great Way" government.

Japanese Attitude Suddenly Becomes More Active

It is heard that important officials from the Japanese army, navy, and diplomatic corps met yesterday afternoon on the Japanese flagship to discuss the measures that the Japanese authorities will take regarding the shooting incident. This statement can indicate that the Japanese side's previous position on the Western District has completely changed. They previously refused to study protests regarding incidents that occurred in these areas, but now they seem to be suddenly concerned about the Western District incident. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council's position is greatly complicated, as it is not yet known whether the Japanese authorities agree to participate in the events of Saturday and Sunday.

Italian Military Agrees to Take Responsibility for the Area

The area where the Shanghai Municipal Council police patrol team and the "Great Way" police team clashed on Saturday, as well as the area surrounding Great Western Road and Connaught Road, is within the defense zone of the Italian marines. Yesterday, Lieutenant Colonel Villard, the commander of the Italian marines, led his troops to protect it. After the shooting incident occurred, other "Great Way" police officers, accompanied by a Japanese advisor, and acting Superintendent Smith of the police force, accompanied by a police team, arrived at the scene one after another. The situation was tense. Before long, Lieutenant Colonel Villard, in order to avoid further disputes, took full responsibility for the area. After this offer was accepted, Lieutenant Colonel Villard sent his troops to protect the area. Two rifles and two Mauser pistols seized from the two dead and two wounded "Great Way" police officers were also handed over to Lieutenant Colonel Villard for safekeeping until the entire investigation is completed.

Puppet Police Provoked and Opened Fire First

At the same time, Kim Luke, a trainee Western inspector who was shot in the back in the shooting incident, is recovering at the Lester Chinese Hospital. It is heard that he has made satisfactory progress yesterday and is expected to be discharged from the hospital in a few days. A senior police officer told reporters yesterday that no protest from the "Reformed Government" has been received regarding this matter. The officer also pointed out that one of the "Great Way" police officers opened fire first and that these people have no right to operate on the Shanghai Municipal Council roads. It was entirely appropriate for Inspector Kim to stop the team, as Kim was trying to ascertain whether the "Great Way" police were only crossing the Shanghai Municipal Council roads or were operating on the Shanghai Municipal Council roads.

Trouble Started Immediately After Initial Interrogation

According to what was agreed with the police force, they could cross the road from one post to another. If the team was indeed changing posts, the accident would not have occurred. However, the fact is that the shooting of trainee Western Inspector Kim when they were interrogated was the cause of the shooting incident. "Although the Reformed police are not allowed to operate on the Shanghai Municipal Council roads," the police force does not object to them crossing the Shanghai Municipal Council roads from one patrol station or police station to another. When Western Inspector Kim questioned the "Great Way" police, two people in plain clothes in the team spoke rudely, and Kim said that their destination was none of his business. One or two seconds later, gunshots suddenly rang out, and the "Great Way" police team suffered a tragic outcome.

Bureau is Studying Action

Italian marines patrolled the area yesterday, and everything was peaceful. Lieutenant Colonel Villard will continue to be responsible for protecting the area and keeping the seized firearms and ammunition in his capacity as a neutral party until the investigations of all matters by both sides are completed. According to a Shanghai Municipal Council official who responded to inquiries yesterday, no protest has been lodged regarding this unfortunate incident, but there are very good reasons to protest the "Great Way" police team's destruction of the Shanghai Municipal Council roads and the shooting of police officers. The bureau will study the action.

Kim's Condition Has Improved

According to the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, Kim Luke, a trainee Western inspector of the police force, was shot by the "Great Way" police near Great Western Road and Connaught Road on Saturday night. He is recovering at the Lester Chinese Hospital and is much better today (the 21st). Police officers and British sentries are stationed in the hospital to guard him. Two "Great Way" police officers who were wounded by Kim's machine gun fire in retaliation and taken to the police force hospital on Shanhai Pass Road were transferred to Fumin Hospital yesterday afternoon (the 20th). Another "Great Way" police officer was shot dead by Kim on the spot, and another suffered four bullets in the stomach and was seriously injured.

Courageous Actions Inspire Inspectors and Police

The foreign personnel of the police force have recently been discouraged due to the low exchange rate, reduced travel expenses for returning home, and assignment to "badlands" without definite action and at the risk of their lives. They are now inspired by Kim's excellent actions. If the authorities fully support Kim's actions, they must take positive action in the Western District. If, for Kim's safety, he is sent back to England, then the police force's ability to satisfy, which has been demonstrated by the resignation of more than a dozen key personnel in recent days, will be even worse.

Shanghai West Defenses are More Stringent

This morning (the 21st), it was heard that the Shanghai Municipal Council did not hold a special meeting to discuss this matter. It is expected that the bureau will not issue a statement on this matter. A large number of police patrol teams continue to patrol the roads in the "badlands." In addition to rifles, British military patrol trucks are now equipped with machine guns.

Puppet "Mayor" Visits Fessenden

According to the Japanese-language Continental News, "Shanghai Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an visited Fessenden, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, on Sunday afternoon and lodged an oral protest regarding the shooting incident on Great Western Road on Saturday night. It is expected that the "Special Municipal Government" authorities will submit a written protest to the Shanghai Municipal Council.

Japanese Side Believes it is a Hostile Action

According to the North-China Daily News, regarding the shooting incident on Great Western Road on Saturday night, it is heard that the Japanese army, navy, and diplomatic authorities have made an important decision yesterday on the measures to be taken and are preparing to respond to any attitude that the Shanghai Municipal Council may take on this incident. It is heard that the Japanese army, navy, and diplomatic authorities are deeply concerned about this unfortunate incident. They held a meeting on the

Izumo Flagship

at noon yesterday. Those who participated in the discussion included Rear Admiral Kusaka, Chief of Staff of the Naval Fleet, Lieutenant General Nomura, Military Attaché, Consul General Miura, Chief of the Army's Takeshita Special Agency, and Commander of the Sakurai Garrison. Japanese officials held a meeting on the ship for two and a half hours, focusing on the "British-ruled" Shanghai Municipal Council's repeated expression of

Opposition to Japan

It is heard that Japanese officials unanimously agreed to take "stern measures" to deal with the "publicly expressed hostile attitude of the Public Concession authorities." According to a Domei News Agency report, well-informed observers said that the Japanese authorities are deeply concerned about

Maintaining Peace

and order in the Public Concession, which they regard as a similar occupied area, but the Public Concession police force "massacred" the police of the "Shanghai Special Municipality," which is an act of violence against Japan that opposes and hates the Japanese army and navy. The attitude of the "British-ruled" Shanghai Municipal Council has proven that Britain has violated the Tokyo negotiations and the compromises on fundamental principles

Guaranteed

In addition, a Japanese major went to the site of the shooting on Saturday night to investigate yesterday afternoon and then issued a statement before dusk, listing four reasons, strongly claiming that the British police (Kim Luke) opened fire first. The North-China Daily News also reported that Domei News Agency's Nanjing dispatch on the 20th said that regarding the shooting incident, officials of the "Reformed Government" are maintaining

Close Contact

with the Japanese authorities in Shanghai today regarding the possible measures to be taken.

The "Reformed Government" is also closely monitoring the attitude of the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council. Government officials held an emergency meeting regardless of the holiday to consider the "Shanghai Special Municipality's" report on the shooting incident. The leaders of the "Reformed Government" called the case a "provocative action expressing the British's hostile attitude."

### Taxpaying Chinese in Shanghai Request Authorities to Maintain Food Supply With Full Authority, Dredge Sources, Gradually Purchase and Store, Implement Price Controls to Maintain Security; Signs of Rice Looting Have Emerged

The Taxpaying Chinese Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, saying, "Sir, the rice and food problem is the most serious problem of the day. If it is not resolved quickly, the consequences of the bread problem during the time of Louis XVI can serve as a warning. The causes of this problem are the blockage of sources and hoarding. Your bureau has always attached importance to the stability of life, and the problem of food rice is the most likely to promote the instability of life. Now is a critical moment. Your bureau, as its responsibility lies, should exercise its power for the sake of the life stability of all residents and adopt the above-mentioned suggestions: (1) Actively dredge sources; (2) Gradually purchase and store, and implement price controls. The deficit should be temporarily borrowed and subsidized, and then a solution should be sought. (3) Investigate and publicly report the rice stored in all banks, money houses, and warehouses. If it is stored by rice shops, the deadline for selling at a fixed price should be limited. If it is hoarded by individuals, it should be announced and sold at half price. Otherwise, we should give it a fair sanction. The matter concerns people's food and public security. If the power given by public opinion is not used and the danger is prevented before it happens, it will be difficult to put out the fire. Accordingly, we will send a letter, hoping to check and handle it quickly. People's food and public safety depend on it."

Market Resumes Business, Transactions are Chaotic

After the Shanghai Bean and Rice Market Management Committee resolved to temporarily suspend the market from the 18th of this month, it resumed opening at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, and the Market Management Committee announced that all market operations must register the cargo owner and consignee so that transportation and sales are in compliance and easy to report. After the market opened, the transaction was extremely chaotic, which was rare in history, and prices rose again.

Advise Vendors to Find Ways to Transport

Regarding the free transportation of rice to Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Council has negotiated with the Japanese authorities and advised rice merchants to sell the stored rice at a fair price, deciding to maintain the food supply within the concession with full authority. It is heard that the negotiations are going smoothly, and various groups are also continuing to discuss raising funds and ordering goods, deciding to handle the price control in order to avoid affecting the livelihood of the common people. Various rice industry groups have advised vendors to find ways to transport rice to Shanghai for relief within the possible scope. Xiang rice from Wuhu has also arrived in Shanghai.

Authorities Send Police to Protect Rice Shops

At 89 Changping Road, the Yuyuanxin Rice Shop actually had a rice looting spree the night before, and one hundred and twenty bags of flour were stolen. The eight men and women who were arrested were transferred to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. It is heard that the concession authorities have granted the request of the Rice Shop Association and sent detectives to be stationed in various rice shops to protect them.

### Vehicles Passing Through the Suburbs are Intercepted and Forcibly Requisitioned, Each Car is Charged One Yuan, It is Said that the Collection Will be Indefinite

According to the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, starting at noon today (the 21st), the "Great Way" police are blocking cars driving along Hongqiao Road near Warren Road and charging one yuan before allowing them to pass. According to the "Great Way" police, the money will be used to "repair the road" and will be collected from each car every day indefinitely.

It is also reported that rickshaws or cars traveling in Pudong and Shanghai West have been forcibly stopped by local people in recent days, forcing them to obtain so-called "vehicle licenses," and the fees are extremely high, more than double what the municipal government charged before the war. General rickshaw and car merchants are all complaining incessantly.

### Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank Announces Extension of Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes Due to Insufficient Procedures for Temporary Extension; Instructions on Disposal of Stamps will be Requested from the Head Office

The Central Bank, upon the order of the Ministry of Finance, issued fractional currency notes of 1 fen and 5 fen, which have been printed by the American company Yongning. The Shanghai Branch of the bank was originally scheduled to issue them today. Due to insufficient procedures, the issuance was temporarily postponed. Regarding the disposal of stamps circulating on the market, the post office will request instructions from the Kunming Head Office after the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce suggested a solution. The details are as follows:

Temporary Decision to Postpone Issuance

The first batch of 500,000 yuan of fractional currency notes of 1 fen and 5 fen have been printed by the American company Yongning Printing Co., Ltd., including 300,000 yuan of 1 fen notes, with the front and back both in red, and 200,000 yuan of 5 fen notes, with the front and back both in blue. The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank was originally scheduled to issue them starting today (the 22nd). The bank had already prepared the issuance announcement and sent it to various newspapers for advertising. Due to insufficient procedures, the issuance announcement was withdrawn, and it was decided to postpone the issuance. Once the issuance date is determined, another announcement will be made. A reporter from the New Voice Society met with the person in charge of the bank last night, who stated with certainty that the issuance of fractional currency notes has been decided to be postponed because the issuance procedures are insufficient.

Disposal of Stamps

Regarding the issue of disposing of stamps, a reporter from the New Voice Society made a special visit to the various departments of the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday. It was stated that the Postal Administration has recently received suggestions from various groups such as the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, all of which are concerned about the livelihood of the common people. In terms of human sentiment, it should be accepted. However, according to the Postal Regulations (Ministry of Communications Order promulgated on October 30, 1936), Section 2,

Sold Stamps

Article 135 states that, except as provided in Article 10, Paragraph 2 of the Postal Law, stamps, postage due stamps, postcards, and special postal cards, once sold, will not be redeemed at a price, nor may they be exchanged for other types. Also, the Postal Law (promulgated on July 5, 1935, and implemented on November 1, 1936) Article 10, the postal authorities may submit a request to the Ministry of Communications to forward to the Executive Yuan for approval to

Cancel Stamps

that it issues, but it should be announced one month in advance and the sale should be stopped. Holders of the canceled stamps in the preceding paragraph may exchange them for new stamps at the postal authorities within six months from the date of cancellation. Article 10 states that stamps that have been damaged lose their validity. The same provisions apply to postcards and special postal cards where the price indicated on the pattern is damaged. Therefore, regarding the issue of disposing of this huge amount of stamps and recovering them, a decision will be made after gathering

Various Suggestions

and requesting instructions from the Kunming Postal Administration to provide appropriate solutions. It is expected that the Head Office will be considerate of the difficulties of the merchants or will allow slightly damaged stamps to be affixed at the original price. As for the postal authorities recovering them at the original price, it is feared that it will be difficult to fulfill the wish. Also, according to Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank is about to issue 1-fen and 5-fen subsidiary currency notes, and the issue of 400,000 stamps circulating in the market urgently needs a solution to avoid

Civilian Losses

Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from Datong News Agency inquired with the responsible party of the Shanghai Postal Administration and learned that Mr. Zapletal, the Postmaster of the Bureau, has received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce suggesting three points. Except for the first point, which is that slightly damaged stamps due to circulation should be allowed to be affixed as much as possible,

No Penalties

The Postal Administration can do so for the sake of being considerate to the people. The second point is not related to the Postal Administration itself, and the third point is that the Postal Administration should recover the stamps in the hands of hawkers, which goes beyond the scope of the Postal Administration's business and there is no room for consideration. The above decision has been formally replied to the Chamber of Commerce by Postmaster Zapletal yesterday.

### Refugee Relief Increases Sharply, Extending the Date of Acknowledged Donations, Various Fundraising Committees Also Continue to Intensify Fundraising

During the first general meeting of members of the Refugee Relief Association, representatives of various participating groups believed that it was still difficult to send the refugees staying in Shanghai. The general meeting unanimously resolved to continue fundraising in accordance with the original methods of acknowledged donations. It is reported that various industry groups and individuals who have acknowledged donations, previously identified for one year or half a year, have automatically extended the donation date in view of the difficulties in providing for the refugees. Among them are those who offer a percentage of business income, a percentage of salary, and households who save on monthly household expenses to help donate. The enthusiasm to contribute is moving. According to the refugee relief standard, it was only two yuan per person per month in November of last year. Now, due to soaring prices, it has been raised to four yuan per person per month. The increase has doubled in six months, so the relief expenses have become more enormous. The association's citizen, fellow villager, amateur, and industry groups are now following the resolutions of the general meeting and continuing to promote fundraising work.

### Forming an Evaluation Committee to Suppress and Stabilize Citywide Prices, Actively Seeking Opinions and Proceeding, Representatives from Authorities and Chambers of Commerce will be Invited to Participate

Since the black market exchange rate collapsed, the market for foreign goods has increased due to doubled shipping costs and increased costs, and the selling price has risen accordingly. For several weeks, prices have soared, and the lives of citizens have been difficult. In the past, suggestions have been made by various sectors to the concession authorities to suppress and stabilize market prices in order to maintain livelihoods. It is reported that various industry trade associations, in view of the soaring prices that are detrimental

to Concession Security

Some industry trade associations have proposed the establishment of a "Shanghai City Industry Trade Association Evaluation Committee." Currently, it is still actively proceeding, soliciting opinions from various industry trade associations. Once completed, it can be formally established and announced. At that time, the authorities of the two concessions and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the British and French Concession Taxpayers Association of China will be invited to send representatives to participate in the joint evaluation. It is heard that in the future

Matters to be Handled

(1) Suppress and stabilize prices in various industries to maintain the livelihood of residents; (2) Advise firms in various industries to endure sacrifices; (3) Investigate hoarders and unscrupulous merchants; (4) Jointly submit a request to the government authorities to provide relief. As for the members of the committee, the committee members of the various industry trade associations are the ex officio members. If the association can proceed smoothly and be established on a regular basis, it will be a great benefit to the four million citizens of Shanghai, which is not insignificant. Those responsible for carrying it out are working hard for it.

### Various Groups Pay Respects to Chen Bingqian Today

The late Cantonese gentleman Chen Bingqian was enthusiastic about public welfare throughout his life, made contributions to society, and benefited his hometown. He was admired by Chinese and foreigners. Unfortunately, he passed away in Macau in August of his birth year. When the sad news came, we were all deeply saddened. Today (the 22nd) is the anniversary of Mr. Chen's death. His family is holding a vegetarian banquet and setting up offerings at Huguo Temple on Route Mandelon. All members of the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation of the city, all directors of the Guangdong Hospital, have prepared offerings and will personally go to pay their respects today to express their condolences. It is heard that many people from all walks of life are participating, which shows that his legacy lives on in the hearts of people. At that time, there will be a grand and sorrowful occasion in front of the Huguo Temple.

### Zhaofeng Garden String Concert

The Shanghai Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold a string concert in Zhaofeng Park from 9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. on the 22nd (weather permitting). There are six items on the program.

### The Second-Line Troops at the Front are Ordered to Strengthen the Blockade to Prevent the Dumping of Inferior Goods to Promote its Collapse, and to Eliminate Traitors from Leaking Military Secrets

The Military Affairs Commission reported that recently, Japanese goods have often been secretly smuggled into the inland for dumping in our blockade areas, and the large quantity is alarming. Japanese goods can be found in areas close to each theater of war. If the report is true, it is tantamount to helping Japan carry out economic aggression, and if there are many smugglers, if we have military action, these people will inevitably be confused by their own interests, and driven by profit, they will leak military secrets, which is especially worrying. The commanders of each theater of war must strictly supervise the second-line troops, strictly block the blockade, so as to promote the accelerated collapse of the Japanese economy. If any unscrupulous officers and soldiers are engaged in harboring them, they will be punished as traitors, and if they are negligent in prevention, they should also be punished accordingly. It is heard that an order has been issued for compliance.

### Talk with Mr. Jin Zongcheng

— Kan

Mr. Jin Zongcheng is a person full of enthusiasm. He is very humble to others and strict with himself. For any public welfare events in society that are valuable, he does his best to assist. However, he refuses to bend the rules for matters that involve personal gain under the guise of public service. He believes that such things have a small impact on individuals but a very large responsibility for deceiving society.

Therefore, Mr. Jin always considers carefully the positions he takes. He asks himself, "Is this beneficial to society? Is this harmful to the public?" Only if the answer to the former is satisfactory does he agree to take on the responsibility. Once he takes on the responsibility, he does it seriously and never carelessly.

In recent years, his personal life has been particularly simple. He has not only abandoned all hobbies, but he also refuses to even touch cigarettes. He primarily uses domestic products in his daily life. He even examines the most basic necessities. If there is anything suspicious, he would rather discard them than use them.

We know that Mr. Jin's character has unique qualities that can serve as a model for young people. We have written to him twice, hoping to visit him, but Mr. Jin declined in his replies. He said that he does not seek empty fame. At this time, he would rather do more work than talk empty words.

The night before yesterday, I met Mr. Jin at a banquet. I didn't want to force him to do something difficult by pestering him with the word "interview." However, in the space of an hour, we talked about many issues in bits and pieces. Mr. Jin has great expectations for his business. He told me about the improvements made to the New-New Company, especially regarding the New Capital Hotel. Mr. Jin is the chairman of the New-New Company, and he personally experiences everything.

He said: "The business purpose of the New-New Company is to promote domestic products, serve society, make small profits with large sales, and provide attentive service as a consistent policy. Our shopping mall, the New Capital Hotel, and the New-New Restaurant have air conditioning in the summer and hot air in the winter. It can be said that it is warm in winter and cool in summer, and it is spring all year round. We established a deposit-purchase department. Because the guarantee is secure and the procedures are simple, customers can take goods or cash. Customers find it very convenient. We established the Green Treasure Theater to improve spoken drama based on the principle of benefiting the world and people's hearts. He also focuses on the enrichment of goods and talents, always upholding the spirit of improvement. He applies scientific management methods. It is also fortunate that our General Manager, Mr. Li Ze, is young and energetic. He has an innovative mind, a spirit of creation, and the perseverance to do things. He shares the same aspirations as me, and we cooperate in everything. Therefore, all plans can proceed smoothly."

We all know that the New Capital Hotel was rebuilt from the rooftop garden. But since there is already the New-New Restaurant, why set up the New Capital Hotel?

Mr. Jin said: "Our motivation to transform the rooftop garden amusement park from low-level entertainment to a high-class venue predates August 13th. Later, due to the impact of the war, it was delayed until now to be implemented. However, when we started this new plan, many people thought that running an amusement park could make money every year, which was much more profitable than other businesses. Why bother spending manpower and financial resources to reform? This common mentality is actually not bad; however, most of them only know one thing but not the other. Because the area of the New-New Amusement Park is not as large as other amusement parks, although the air is more sufficient than its peers, the number of people it can accommodate is not large. If we operate a cheap amusement park with inferior content, it will become an entertainment venue below standard, inevitably harboring dirt and harming society. Wouldn't this be contrary to the rational business purpose? At the same time, we felt that people in society needed a high-class and legitimate entertainment venue. All of this made us determined to reform, sparing no manpower and material resources, and gradually preparing to create this New Capital Hotel."

"How was the reconstruction process?" I asked. Mr. Jin replied: "Running a new building is of course not without difficulties. It is even more difficult to transform an old house into a new venue. Our sixth and seventh floors have been an amusement park for more than ten years. The changes of the times and the changes of the environment have gradually made it a low-level amusement. Therefore, this time we decided to engage in reconstruction. All the engineering and various installations cost no less than 100,000 yuan; and all the planning was personally undertaken by our General Manager Li. For the past two months, he has worked day and night with model design experts and supervised craftsmen to transform this dilapidated and filthy place into a brand-new look, completing the most high-class place for dining and entertainment. We also spent more than 10,000 yuan to install a glass broadcasting station. It is indeed clear singing and beautiful dancing, vivid images and sounds, pleasing and delightful, and creating a new era for the Far East Radio Station. Other entertainment facilities are all available, and the layout is extremely luxurious. We also asked gardening experts to plan and arrange the seventh-floor garden."

The above is about the New-New Company. We can see Mr. Jin's seriousness in doing things and his far-sighted plans.

In fact, in addition to being a social worker, Mr. Jin's basic job is to devote himself to the banking business. Because he was trained to be a hardworking, resilient, and cultured person in his youth, he now fully utilizes the experience and knowledge he has accumulated. Therefore, he can serve society and seek welfare for the public. These are by no means achievements of a single day. I think young people should emulate this.

Mr. Jin is very humble and unwilling to talk to me about personal matters. What I have written above is just what I have gleaned from his words and deeds.

If it is believed that my observations are not very wrong, readers should all express admiration, I think.

### Only a Good Husband Can Have a Good Wife

Any beautiful, passionate, or so-called virtuous young woman, if she marries a careless, reckless, or weak and incompetent man, even if she is full of thoughts of how to love her husband and how to build a harmonious family, this enthusiasm will sometimes turn to ashes, or even be regarded by her husband and others as a fickle shrew or a seductive enchantress. What greater injustice in the world could there be!

We know that women's emotions have a rhythm, and this rhythm is like the tides in the ocean. Those who are good at sailing will be able to adapt to and utilize this tide to complete their work. If you want to control this tide, won't you be laughed at by the ocean? If women disregard their own impulses to comply with men's desires, it is sometimes simply impossible. About once a month for menstruation, a full month of pregnancy, and several months after childbirth, this is too unnatural and too dangerous! Even in ordinary times, a careless husband does not understand the subtle sexual tides of women. When a wife shows intimacy, he thinks she is being seductive, or he doesn't notice it at all. But when her sexual tide recedes, he feels her coldness, so he says she is fickle! At the same time, in today's lack of sex education and the hectic nature of life, men's desires are often superficial, bland, and eager to be satisfied, lacking the elements of beauty and the knowledge of how to use emotions, making it impossible for their wives to get full satisfaction. It's no wonder that his wife is fickle or restless.

Let us say a fair word, rude men are in the majority, but after the transformation of married life, they should always be more careful. Being careful is good for any of your undertakings. It is equal to the fact that due to the lack of sex education in his early years, he suffered from self-masturbation and nocturnal emission, or after marriage he indulged in licentiousness and injured his sexual function, suffering from premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, neurasthenia, sperm exhaustion, infertility, etc., then he should frankly and quickly cure his illness, and not blame his wife for his own uselessness, and fall into double sins in love!

According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the most effective treatment for the above symptoms is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhisu." This preparation is made by scientifically replicating gonadal hormones extracted from the bodies of strong animals such as gorillas, bears, deer, and sea dogs. Therefore, its precious quality and great efficacy are unparalleled in the world. After taking it, patients can produce sperm to nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves within one day and night. Continued use can also promote development and regulate metabolism. It can cure various symptoms in a short period of time. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can also prolong life, rejuvenate, and return to youth. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Himitoto's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to strengthen the sperm barrier and stop leakage for even faster results!

### Diseases After Untreated Nocturnal Emission

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Things must rot from within before worms will infest them. The arrival of all diseases must first be due to one's own negligence. Young people mistakenly commit masturbation due to sexual impulses and curiosity, or early marriage and indulgence, which is the source of all diseases, because this kind of unreasonable sexual behavior is most likely to injure the sexual nerves, relax the sperm barrier, and cause nocturnal emission. Once nocturnal emission starts, although it has already shown a symbol of his weakness, if it can be treated early, not only can some vitality be preserved, but treatment is also relatively easy. If it is delayed and left untreated day after day, due to the excessive loss of semen, the weakening of sexual nerves will further affect the weakening of all the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. As a result, the brain is weak and forgetful, sleepless and prone to dreams at night, often dizzy and swollen in the head, and feel sore in the waist and back and tired limbs after a little work. In sexual life between couples, due to the aggravation of sexual neurasthenia, there are even symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and loss of energy. At the same time, the development function is blocked, and there are cases where the sexual organs of adults are like those of children, and the body cannot be majestic. As for the yellow face and thin muscles, premature aging, or even shortening the lifespan, this is due to the reduction of metabolism. In short, due to the exhaustion of essence and blood after untreated nocturnal emission, all kinds of diseases can be caused, and some diseases are simply incredible. The above are just the most common cases!

I dare to give a loyal advice to young people with nocturnal emission, that is, if you don't have nocturnal emission, then it's fine. Once you have nocturnal emission, you must seek treatment as soon as possible. At this time, if you can abstain from masturbation and have a clear heart and few desires, and at the same time take the effective medicine "Himitoto's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets," you can achieve the magical effect of sleeping soundly and stopping nocturnal emission that night. This medicine is secretly prepared by Dr. Himitoto of Germany, and has been adopted by famous doctors at home and abroad for many times. It does have the unique effect of consolidating the sperm barrier, calming the nerves, and curing nocturnal emission. If you already have the above symptoms due to nocturnal emission or indulgence, you must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" (available in Chinese and Western pharmacies) to nourish the brain and kidneys, essence, blood, and nerves. Continued use will surely restore perfect health as soon as possible.

This is a recent fact. Wang Zhiqiang, a 19-year-old middle school student, had nocturnal emission because he admired a female classmate, and suffered from severe brain weakness and insomnia due to his busy studies. He came to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment during the summer vacation, and I immediately instructed him to purchase and take "Himitoto's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" and "Shengzhisu" together, and also applied electrotherapy injections. By treating both the symptoms and the root cause, he recovered completely in less than a month. According to reports, he has been admitted to a certain university.

Beauty

### Withered and Shrunken Breasts Are the Biggest Threat to Women

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Women's concept of beauty is indeed much stronger than that of men. Not only do women from wealthy families want to be extremely extravagant and decorate themselves to the fullest. Even the women from middle and lower-class families are not willing to be perfunctory about this point. To put it jokingly, the days are so long now, they don't even have the courage to buy a few cents of snacks when they are hungry in the afternoon. But at the same time, if someone says that this thing is very beautiful when used on women. Then even if it costs three or five dollars, they will still buy it to try it out. Some fathers and brothers' economic strength is not very sufficient, or the money given to her by her husband is only for all the necessary expenses, and no extra money is given to her to buy things. Then she would rather endure and save, and even scrape from the children's bodies to buy decorations. This so-called "love of beauty," she thinks she is taking care of both public and private interests, and is complacent, but in the eyes of us doctors and forward-looking men, it only feels foolish and despicable!

You must know that the modern concept of female beauty is completely based on the standard of high breasts, plump hips, and obvious curves. If you can meet this standard, then even if you don't apply makeup and wear a simple cloth dress, you can still show your natural beauty and be loved and respected. On the other hand, if the breasts are withered and shrunken, the hips are thin, and the beauty is lost. Then even if you dress up like a flower butterfly, you will only increase people's disgust and have no happiness! If you want to remedy this, according to the experience of famous doctors in various countries and my experience. It is generally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation "Shengzhisu" for women is the most effective treatment. This preparation can nourish the ovarian function, promote metabolism, regulate the various endocrine glands in the body, warm the uterus, and stop leucorrhea within one day and night after taking it. If you continue to take it, it will surely make the breasts high, the hips plump, the cheeks rosy, and enhance beauty in a short period of time.

### The Impact of Orchitis on Reproduction

Orchitis, in the changes of gonorrhea, can be called the most likely to affect reproductive function. The reason why orchitis easily makes men lose their ability to conceive is that the testicles are composed of countless glands, and these countless glands all have the function of constructing sperm. If gonococcal toxins invade these valuable organs, the prognosis will be terrible. In my clinical statistics over the past ten years, those who lose their fertility due to gonorrhea and suffer the sadness of lacking descendants are mostly because the testicles have been ravaged by gonorrhea. Since these reproductive elements have been damaged, it is naturally impossible to hope that they will grow. However, in terms of the distance of transmission, the gonococcal diplococci from the anterior urethra invaded the testicles, and the distance cannot be said to be far. If the treatment is effective in the anterior urethra where gonorrhea is clustered, and the doctor's instructions can be followed and the health regimen is strictly observed, orchitis will not occur. In reality, however, most patients go to doctors with poor equipment or take inferior medicines indiscriminately, delaying treatment, and then have orchitis. However, at the beginning of orchitis, it is mostly biased to one side, called epididymitis. If it has not been quickly extinguished, if both testicles develop inflammation and become hardened, then there is a danger of infertility in nineteen cases. Therefore, attention must be paid to the treatment of established orchitis. The most effective symptomatic treatment is to use German Lysoform Direct-Current Therapy to make the bactericidal power directly reach the lesion. It not only takes the bactericidal effect, but also filters the gonococcal toxins and restores the reproductive function. Diagnosis time: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM

### Japanese Troops Operating in West Shanghai Changed to Heavy Weapons, Changed Aircraft Reconnaissance Strategies, Sent Many Tanks to Fill Defenses, Beijing-Shanghai Train is Closed West of Changzhou

According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the Japanese army has obviously changed its plan to send planes to scout the guerrilla teams in the western district of Shanghai. Yesterday morning (the 21st), more than a dozen tanks and several trucks were sent, and at around 7:00, they drove along Hongqiao Road towards the airfield. There was no sound of gunfire in the Hongqiao area before noon, probably because the guerrillas did not attack the Japanese army equipped with heavy weapons.

Changzhou and West Sections of Tracks Destroyed

It is reported that yesterday morning, tourists who went to the North Railway Station to purchase Nanjing passenger tickets all returned in disappointment because the station had stopped selling them. It is reported that a section of the road between Changzhou and Nanjing was repeatedly attacked by guerrillas and some sections of the track were destroyed, so passenger cars could not travel, and the sale of Nanjing passenger tickets was suspended. It was also heard that passenger and freight trains from Shanghai only went to Changzhou, and passenger tickets west of Changzhou were also suspended, not just Nanjing station.

Japanese Troops From Shangchuan Transferred to Shangnan

Yesterday afternoon, the small train on the Shangchuan Railway in Pudong was forced to stop all up and down passenger cars, and traffic on Shangchuan was interrupted. The reason was that all vehicles were used for military transport to transfer Japanese troops from Chuansha to Shanghai, which was transferred to the Shangnan Railway. It is heard that they will deal with the new offensive recently launched by the guerrillas in the Nanhui area. The troops are transported by waterway from Gao Miao Wharf, the starting point of Shangchuan Road, to Zhoujiadu Wharf, the starting point of Shangnan Road on South Huangpu River.

Requisitioned Ferries, Water and Land Advance Together

Two ferries, Takabashi Maru and Kasuie Maru, which were also requisitioned from Japanese merchants, were both anchored at Gao Miao Wharf. Until 6:30 in the evening, no military vehicles were seen coming from Shangchuan Road. After the Takabashi and Kasuie ferries were requisitioned, two small ferries, Weisai Maru and Qichang Maru, were temporarily assigned to the Takabashi and South Wharf routes, and the Donggou Maru ferry was maintained on the South Wharf route.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Route, Hai Fu Joins, Freight Transport is More Prosperous Than Before, But Loading and Unloading is Very Inconvenient

After the Shanghai-Ningbo route was given a grace period by the authorities, transportation was slightly more prosperous than before, and the number of passengers also doubled. However, the problem of lightering at Zhenhai Port is that although Tianbao Wheel has implemented intermodal transport and made every effort to protect passenger safety, freight transport is still difficult to be quick, so the schedule cannot be shortened. The Sino-Italian Company's Deping Wheel was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 18th, but due to the waiting for cargo,

Repeated Postponements

It only arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 pm yesterday. It is said that the incoming goods still could not be loaded as much as possible, and the date of mooring in Zhenhai was too long, so it had to abandon the incoming goods, and then it set sail to return to Shanghai this morning. At this time (that is, 4:00 pm yesterday), it has arrived in port and will set sail from Shanghai to Ningbo tomorrow morning. Taikoo Yingzhou Wheel set sail for Ningbo at 2:00 pm the day before yesterday (the 20th)

Does Not Carry Passengers

The New Beijing Wheel will not sail to Ningbo for the time being. It has set sail for a certain place in eastern Zhejiang this morning. The Reiwa Foreign Company's Hai Fu Wheel used to sail on the Wenzhou-Taiwan line. After being blocked by the Japanese army, it has been docked in Shanghai for a long time. It had previously applied to join the Shanghai-Ningbo line. It is now known that it has been approved and will set sail around the 24th or 25th. Currently,

Those Sailing on Shanghai-Ningbo Include Deping, Ende, Mofuku, Hana, Baoli, Yingzhou, and the newly joined Hai Fu, totaling seven ships. Except for Yingzhou Wheel, only six can carry passengers. The new prices for passenger tickets, except for Hana Wheel, which has been implemented when sailing to Ningbo on the 19th, will be implemented by other ships from the 25th. Details have been recorded in previous reports.

### Unhappy Voices of Tourists in French Park, Unreasonable Actions of Russian Gardeners, Harsh Treatment of Chinese People Arouses Repercussions

Yesterday's North China Daily News carried a letter saying that anyone who visits the French Park must pass through the side road next to the lawn, which goes directly to the park gate at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Luban, from the gate on Route Huai Long. Recently, there have been incidents of Russian gardeners insulting innocent Chinese tourists on this road. Here is one of them. Several well-dressed Chinese men and women were sitting on chairs placed there.

Russian Gardener

One passed by the place and told them to leave. At that time, I was sitting a little farther away from the place, and I saw these Chinese tourists immediately get up and prepare to leave. However, when the Russian stood and watched, they seemed to suppress themselves and did not want to leave. Then I saw them hesitate for a moment and reluctantly carry the chairs away. It was obviously the Russian who ordered them to do so. This made me quite surprised, because Chinese and foreign tourists who have visited the park often sit there and have never encountered harassment. I am also among them. Last Saturday and Sunday afternoon, I

Revisited the Park

I saw that the above-mentioned place had several chairs neatly arranged, and there were also gardeners coming and going, seeing the chairs but not moving them away. Seeing this, I thought to myself that sitting for a moment would not be "breaking the rules." At that time, the sun was scorching hot, and the place was one of the few shady spots. I couldn't help but be tempted by these prepared places to stay.

Rest for a While

However, as soon as I sat down, a Russian came to object and insisted on me moving the chair. The Russian gardener's move was indeed unreasonable, needless to say. In the restricted area with warnings such as "Do not tread on the lawn," such notices are occasionally lost. If someone treads on it, they should not be blamed. Then, how can someone who sits in a place that was previously allowed to rest but now has no sign of prohibition be blamed? Under these circumstances, forcing the person to take the chair that they had

Already Placed There

And move it away in public is definitely not the right way to let them know about the newly prohibited area that has not been announced. It is not impossible to call it intentional insult. I believe that Russians would not dare to inflict this kind of insult on others except for Chinese people. Therefore, I think it is appropriate to let the compatriots who visit the park know the above information as soon as possible. If they are there, do not sit there to avoid being treated

In This Way by Russian Gardeners

And hope that one day someone will teach the Russian gardeners a lesson so that they will not be overly arrogant in treating Chinese tourists who have not broken the rules. This is because I have seen and heard of several tourists being treated in this way by Russian gardeners in this kind and other kinds of incidents. TPL, Qiyue, August 18th,

### Rice Shops Have No Rice to Sell, Hooligans Gather Crowds to Attack Shops, 120 Bags of Flour Were Robbed, Eight Instigators and Others Were Arrested

Yuyuanxin Rice Shop at No. 89 Changping Road was founded by local Wang Huaxiang. Recently, due to the soaring price of rice, there is no goods to meet the demand, and the daily rations of poor households in the nearby area are temporarily replaced by flour. Xie Yandong, a Salt City native at No. 47 on the left side, is a rogue hooligan. A few days ago, he went to the rice shop to buy rice without success and

Had a Quarrel

With the shop owner Wang Huaxiang and left in hatred. At 8:00 pm on the 20th, Yuyuanxin Rice Shop had already closed. Unexpectedly, a large number of poor neighbors, dozens of men, women, old and young, each holding weapons, axes, and wooden sticks, opened the shop door and rushed in, and robbed 120 bags of flour worth 286 yuan.

Then, according to the testimony of the rice shop owner Wang Huaxiang, Judge Jiang Shuzi interrogated the defendants, whose confessions were ambiguous, and they were still remanded in custody and rescheduled for further verification.

### A Woman's Adultery Leads to Death by Knife; Yang A-san Detained for Investigation

Yang A-san, a native of Jiangbei, is 37 years old and works as a chauffeur for a Japanese family. In June of this year, Yang became intimately acquainted with Shao San-guniang, a woman from his hometown. They began living together, renting a house at No. 102, Alley 211, Youheng Road East, Hongkou. Unexpectedly, two weeks ago, Shao San-guniang left without a word. After Yang investigated repeatedly, he learned that Shao had another lover. Overwhelmed by jealousy, he sought revenge. For days, he lured Shao using various methods. On the 20th of this month, at 9:00 PM, Shao was indeed lured to Yang's home. After a disagreement, Yang suddenly pulled out a foreign knife and stabbed Shao San-guniang repeatedly, causing numerous wounds. Blood gushed like a spring, and she collapsed to the ground in agony. Someone reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station, which dispatched Detective Xu Yongyuan to transport the injured woman to Renji Hospital. However, due to the severity of her injuries and excessive blood loss, she died en route. The body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination. The perpetrator, Yang A-san, along with his blood-stained trousers, was taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang presented the case, prosecuting him under Article 277 of the Criminal Code for causing death by injury.

### A Comprehensive Investigation of National Goods Factories Throughout the City; Consolidating the Bulwark of National Goods; Developing Export Sales

Since the outbreak of military conflict, national goods factories in this city, especially those located in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts, have been either destroyed, forced to shut down, or relocated. However, factories in the concessions, being in safer areas, have sprung up like mushrooms after rain in the past two years. Even the previously remote border areas of the concessions are now dotted with factories. Due to the large number of newly established factories, it has become impossible to verify the types of products, trademarks, and names. As a result, unscrupulous merchants have seized the opportunity to repackage and sell counterfeit goods as national products, a phenomenon that has become increasingly common in the market. Furthermore, wealthy merchants are exporting counterfeit national goods in large quantities to overseas markets and various provinces in the Southwest. Although local authorities and organizations have been conducting strict inspections and confiscating counterfeit goods upon discovery, genuine national goods are often mistakenly detained as well. To consolidate the bulwark of national goods and rectify these shortcomings, the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association of this city has launched a comprehensive investigation of all national goods factories in the city, starting yesterday (the 21st). Over a dozen staff members have been assigned to conduct the investigation separately, aiming to thoroughly understand the dynamics of national goods factories in the city and the internal organization of each factory. The goal is to prevent unscrupulous merchants from employing their deceptive tactics. The investigation is expected to be completed around the Double Tenth Festival. The association will compile the findings into a directory of national goods manufacturers in the city, which will be distributed to relevant organizations both domestically and internationally for reference.

### Rural Woman Unfortunate in Love; Sues for Fulfillment of Marriage Contract; Address Unknown, Supplementary Summons Issued

Zhang Xiao-liuzi, a rural woman from Taixing, is 19 years old. Three years ago, she was brought to Shanghai by a fellow villager with the intention of working. However, due to the war, this plan failed. She ended up staying at the home of a Mrs. Wu on Guangxi Road. Seeing that Zhang was quite attractive and could be exploited, Mrs. Wu dolled her up, making her presentable, and renamed her Zhang Lifang. She then accompanied Mrs. Wu in and out of social circles, becoming quite active. Soon, she was introduced to Li Tianhong, a translator for a Japanese trading company, and they became inseparable. Li even vowed to stay together until old age. Unexpectedly, Li suddenly became weary and repeatedly made excuses when urged to set a wedding date. Zhang filed a lawsuit against Li in the First Special District Court, demanding the fulfillment of their marriage agreement, and cited Mrs. Wu as a witness. At the initial hearing, only Zhang appeared. As the address provided for the defendant was incorrect and the summons could not be delivered, the court ordered that the address be verified and corrected before issuing another summons for a subsequent hearing.

### A Former Police Officer Commits Crimes, Flees, and Becomes a Bandit; Arrested for Resisting Arrest with Gunfire; Wounded by Six Shots, Recovered and Sent to Court for Interrogation

Li Ziming (alias Wang Haifan), badge number 774, a Chinese police officer from Shandong at the Huizhong Police Station, had been serving in the police force for many years. In February of this year, Li suddenly went to the Yanziwo neighborhood on Tiantong Road and attempted to extort money under false pretenses. When this failed, he pulled out a handgun and shot and killed the owner of the Yanziwo. Realizing he had committed a serious crime, Li abandoned his post and fled with his gun.

He then went to the home of his uncle, who was a police officer at a bank on Beijing Road, to borrow money. During their conversation, they had a conflict, and Li shot and injured his uncle before fleeing without a trace. The police station paid close attention to this case and instructed all police stations to search for him. Unexpectedly, Li Ziming turned out to be inherently violent. After losing his job, he became a bandit and joined a criminal gang. On July 8th of this year, at 5:15 PM, Li,

along with four accomplices,

armed, broke into Yan Yuncheng's newly opened Youli Cigarette and Paper Shop at No. 1297 Yu Yuan Road in Western Shanghai and stole 20 French dollars. As they were fleeing, someone reported them to Japanese police officer No. 789 and Chinese police officers Nos. 2189 and 2495, who gave chase. Li immediately opened fire to resist arrest, and the Chinese and Japanese police officers returned fire. Li was hit by six bullets, injured,

and captured.

A handgun and four bullets were confiscated. Li was then taken to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital for treatment. After recovering somewhat, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning by Chinese detectives Guan Huchen and Cui Buyun from the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the circumstances, stating that the police station still needed to investigate further and requesting a postponement. Judge Xiao ordered Li to be detained pending further investigation, rescheduling the hearing for fourteen days later.

### Young Master Gao Zhenyi's Continuous Fraud; Sentenced to Punishment; Famous Courtesans Wen-di, Lao-si, etc. Defrauded of Huge Sums; Sentenced to Two Years for Continuous Fraud

Gao Zhenyi, the son of Gao Ziruo, a wealthy silk merchant from Hangzhou, was known for his extravagant lifestyle. He became acquainted with famous Shanghai courtesans Wen-di, Lao-si, and Ying Huizhen. After the outbreak of the war, Gao Zhenyi came to Shanghai and opened the so-called Xinghua Bank at No. 122 Nanjing Road, engaging in speculative ventures. At the same time, in addition to indulging in romance, Gao also frequented famous gambling dens

in Hollywood, Rongsheng, Qiuyue, etc.

in Western Shanghai, leading to overwhelming debts that he could not repay. Although his family was wealthy, they refused to provide financial assistance due to Gao Zhenyi's improper behavior. Therefore, Gao had to rack his brains to find a way to salvage the situation. Knowing that Ying Huizhen had considerable savings and that women generally valued money above all else, he used sweet words to persuade Ying, claiming that he was planning to invest in businesses such as cotton, rice, salt, sea cucumber, and Korean ginseng, which would surely generate profits of over 100%. Because he was a close friend, he told her this information. If she was interested in cooperation,

he was willing to offer his services.

Ying was also moved by the prospect of such high profits, as Gao was the son of a wealthy family. She took out all her private savings and diamond rings, totaling approximately 45,000 yuan, and handed them to Gao Zhenyi as investment funds. At the same time, she helped to bring in her fellow courtesans, Xu Lou-shi, the wife of Xu, the owner of Yipinxiang, Wu Yu-shi, the wife of Wu Zishen, as well as Gu Guoying and Zhang Xiuzhen, who collectively invested 39,000 yuan, bringing the total to over 84,000 yuan, all of which was handed over to Gao. After obtaining these large sums of money, Gao went straight to

the gambling dens for reckless gambling.

However, to reassure Ying and the others, he had previously paid them interest of four and a half percent, claiming that this was the profit earned. However, as time went on, Gao was unable to repay the principal to Ying and the others, and the scam was exposed. Ying Huizhen and the others reported the matter to the Lao Zha Police Station, and Chief Detective Pang Ruiqing and others arrested Gao last week as he was leaving the Qiuyue Hollywood gambling den. Over a dozen gambling den entrance tickets were found on Gao's person. The First Special District Court

detained him pending trial.

Yesterday, Judge Fang Qinghuan continued the trial in the Fourth Criminal Court. Ying Huizhen and the others retained lawyers Wang Dahang, etc. as their representatives, attaching civil suits. Police lawyers Zhang Tianyin and Zhang Shizhu clarified the process, arguing that Gao Zhenyi's crime of fraud was continuous and should be subject to the maximum penalty increased by one-half in accordance with the law. Therefore, they requested that the court impose a severe punishment, and because Gao Zhenyi had spent all the money obtained through fraud in the gambling dens, there was no

reason for leniency.

Gao's defense was that the money handed over by the plaintiffs was in the nature of a loan, and he had even paid them high interest of four and a half percent this month. After reviewing the testimony, Judge Fang sentenced Gao Zhenyi to two years of imprisonment for continuous fraud to serve as a warning. The attached civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial.

### Xie Peiqing, a Worker at the Hardoon Garden, Loses Three-Year-Old Son to Kidnapping; Hidden in Chinese Territory, Ransom of 15,000 Yuan Demanded; Police Investigate and Solve Case with Japanese Military Assistance

Xie Peiqing, a worker at the Hardoon Garden from Anhui Province, lived with his wife, Shen, at No. 45 An'nan Road. They had a three-year-old son named Xiao Jusheng, whom they doted on. However, Mrs. Shen had two younger brothers, Shen Zhengdao and Shen Zhengxun, who were not good at making a living, resulting in extreme financial hardship. On the morning of the 16th of this month, around 10:00 AM, Xie Xiao Jusheng

suddenly disappeared.

He did not return by nightfall, causing great anxiety for the Xie couple. They immediately launched a search, but without any trace. Later, they received a mailed letter demanding a ransom of 15,000 yuan, signed with the words "brother-in-law." They suspected Shen Zhengdao and his brother of involvement in Xiao Jusheng's disappearance. They reported the information to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and Chinese detectives Guan Huchen, Ma Jinbiao, and Ci Zhilin arrested Shen Zhengdao, Yang Dewen, and Ren Zhengjin. Upon interrogation, they learned that the child was

hidden in Chinese territory

in a straw shed in Yangjiadu. They, together with the Japanese Navy, went to Yangjiadu, recovered Shen Zhengxun and the child Xiao Jusheng. Shen is currently detained at the Japanese Command, and the child was taken back to the police station and returned to his parents. Yesterday morning, Yang, Ren, and Shen were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted them under Article 347 of the Criminal Code for kidnapping and demanding a ransom, presenting the case and requesting a postponement. After a brief interrogation by Judge Xiao, he ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.

### A Group of People Robbed of a Large Sum of Money on Nanjing Road

### Husband Favors Concubine, Assaults Wife

Zhu Juhong, a native of Funing, previously served as Chinese police officer No. 516 at the French Police Station and as a bailiff at the First Special District Court. He was later transferred to the Transportation Department, but was dismissed for misconduct. He lived with his wife, Qiu, at No. 57 Ronghua Lane, Malong Road. Recently, Zhu became involved with a woman named Chongmei, whom he brought home to live with them as a concubine. From then on, the concubine, along with Longmei, lured Qiu to Western Shanghai and severely beat her. Because she could no longer endure it, Qiu filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing her husband, Zhu Juhong, and his concubine, Zhu Longmei, of abandonment and assault, requesting that they be investigated and punished according to the law. After receiving the lawsuit, the court, presided over by Judge Sun Penghang, held a hearing yesterday. The defendants were not summoned and did not appear. Only the plaintiff, Zhu Qiu, appeared to testify about the circumstances. After reviewing the facts, the court ruled that the plaintiff was married to the first defendant, making self-representation inappropriate. As the location of the assault on the second defendant was outside the concession, it was determined that the court lacked jurisdiction.

### Subletter Commits Violence Twice; Sues for Assault and Seeks Compensation

Shao Yizhou, a blind local resident, is 52 years old and works as a fortune teller. He previously ran a business in Nanshi. After the war, he moved into the concession and, in the winter of last year, rented a storefront at No. 40 Kangti Road in the French Concession from Hong Xiaogang, a native of Ningbo who sold herbs. He set up a fortune-telling shop, paying a monthly rent of 15.50 yuan. On June 29th of this year, due to a rent increase dispute, Hong incited his wife, Cai, and her sister to assault and injure Shao. After Shao requested the Second Special District Court to examine his injuries, he retained lawyer Lu Zhongqi and filed a private prosecution in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court against Hong Xiaogang, his wife Hong Cai, and her sister for assault. Judge Jiang Liquan held a hearing, ordering Hong to pay a deposit of 100 yuan as a guarantee of good behavior and rescheduling the hearing. Subsequently, the two parties reached an out-of-court settlement, with Hong compensating Shao 15 yuan for medical expenses, and Shao withdrawing the private prosecution. Unexpectedly, not long after, on the night of the 10th and 14th of this month, due to a dispute over the rent increase, Hong and his wife and his wife's brother, Cai Cuifang, dragged Shao Yizhou and his wife Shao Tong out and beat them, causing serious injuries. Therefore, the Shao couple retained lawyer Lu Zhongqi again and filed a private criminal prosecution in the Second Special District Court against Hong Xiaogang, Hong Cai, Cai Cuifang, etc. for assault, and attached a civil suit, seeking to recover medical expenses of 48 yuan. The case was heard again yesterday morning by Judge Jiang Liquan. The plaintiff, accompanied by his wife, testified about the circumstances of the two assaults and injuries. The defendants retained lawyer Ying Shi to defend them, admitting to the assault and filing a counterclaim for slander. After reviewing the testimony, the court rescheduled the hearing for the 28th, ordering the defendants Hong Xiaogang to pay 100 yuan and Cai Cuifang to pay 50 yuan each as cash guarantees pending review.

### Streetcar Accident; Elderly Man's Left Leg Crushed

Streetcar No. 383 on Route 17, at 1:15 PM yesterday, when arriving at the Jiujiang Road and Jiangxi Road stop, Jia Xiaobao, a 52-year-old man from Zhenjiang, was waiting for the streetcar at that location. As soon as the streetcar stopped, due to the small number of passengers boarding and alighting, the conductor, No. 456, immediately rang the bell and started the streetcar. Jia worked as a seller of boxwood combs, carrying a package in his hand. At that time, the bell had already rung, and Jia had only placed one foot on the streetcar's step. Due to his old age and frailty, and the streetcar moving, he fell and his left leg was crushed by the streetcar wheel. Blood flowed like a fountain. The police station dispatched ambulance No. 81 to provide assistance and immediately transported him to the hospital for treatment. After examination by doctors, his left leg was amputated.

### Deputy Chief of Huizhong Police Station Dong Zhaobin Accused of Inciting a Riot; Trial Begins for the Demolition of the Cade Theatre

Dong Zhaobin (alias Xiao Yong), Chinese Deputy Chief of the Huizhong Police Station, previously rented the Cade Theatre on Zancaide Road from Zhong Dingchen to stage performances. When the contract expired, Dong's request for renewal was rejected by Zhong, leading to a dispute between the two parties. Although some well-known figures attempted to mediate, the parties were unyielding, resulting in no resolution. On the morning of the 6th of this month, around 10:00 AM, over two hundred thugs suddenly rushed into the Cade Theatre, each wielding

iron bars and axes, and launched an attack, assaulting anyone they encountered and destroying everything in sight. All the chairs, tables, and equipment were mostly demolished. Liang Yuting, a Nantong native guarding the premises, attempted to escape to the restroom, but was surrounded by the thugs, who rained down axes and bars on him, causing injuries to his left arm and ankle. Liang managed to escape by climbing over the wall from a trash can, thus avoiding further harm. After the incident, Liang Yuting, who was injured, and Chen Lianzhang, the former manager of the Cade Theatre, believed that

Dong Yong was the ringleader of the incident. They retained lawyers and filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, accusing Dong Yong (alias Zhaobin) of inciting a riot and destroying property, requesting that he be punished in accordance with Article 277, Article 29, and Article 354 of the Criminal Code, etc. After receiving the lawsuit, the court, presided over by Judge Xiao Peishen, first summoned the two plaintiffs to appear yesterday morning (the defendant was not summoned) and, after questioning them, ordered them to leave and await further review.

### Finance: Hong Kong Situation Tense, Foreign Exchange Resales Suddenly Flourish

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices were announced, and there were no changes. In the unofficial market for British and American currencies, the morning opening was immediately lowered to British gold 3 pence 375, and US dollars 6 yuan 5625, because the Japanese bank was very interested in buying, plus the foreign banks were not eager to supply. After the opening, it was calm for a while, but after 10:30 AM, Sassoon suddenly came to give back spot goods, buying long-term months, and because the situation in Hong Kong became increasingly tense, speculators from that side called to come out, and local Chinese banks such as East Asia, Continental, and Overseas Chinese also competed to sell, causing the market to suddenly reverse and trend loosely. As a result, British gold closed at 3 pence 46875, and US dollars at 6 yuan 75. After the closing, the trend was slightly firm. This month's futures were under pressure because of the tense European situation, plus the British-Japanese conference showed cracks, and delivery was imminent, so the bulls came out to leave the market, and the appetite of foreign banks was not healthy, so the situation was quite loose. In the afternoon, the US dollar once firmed to 6 yuan 8125, and there were some transactions. In the end, British gold was 109375 lower, and US dollars were 21875 higher. As for the September futures situation, it was the same as this month, but the loose trend was slightly weaker than this month, so the swap spread was slightly wider. Trading was still active throughout the day.

Sassoon bought forward and sold spot

Early in the morning, the London price for the near-term was up 0.0625, and the far-term was up 0.125. The silver price in New York and the exchange rates of the US against foreign currencies were closed due to the holiday. London gold remained flat. The exchange rate of British against the US was up 1 cent, and against the French franc, it was up 0.025. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's morning opening selling prices for spot goods were only 3 pence 375 for British gold, and only 6 yuan 5625 for US dollars, compared to the previous close, British was 0.046875 tighter, and US dollars were 0.09375 softer. After the opening, the Japanese bank Seikin settled with foreign banks for spot US dollars at 6 yuan 625. Then, Western merchant Sassoon bought the same month's British gold at 2 pence 96875, followed by Chinese merchants also buying the same month's US dollars at 5 yuan 8125 from American banks such as Datong. At 9:20 AM, a Chinese bank blocked foreign banks' British gold at 3 pence 40625, and the same month's US dollars at 6 and a half yuan, to stabilize the situation. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were still no fluctuations, and when the white silver balance tax was announced, it was still exempt. After this, the situation was still quite calm. After 10:30 AM, Western merchant Sassoon suddenly came to give back spot British and American currencies, and Hong Kong also sent a wire to block, so the potential trend suddenly turned loose. It is estimated that Hong Kong's wire and Sassoon successively sold spot British gold to foreign banks at 3 pence 4375 and 46875, and spot US dollars at 6 yuan 6875 and 75. Although Chinese banks also came to sell, the foreign banks frequently came to buy, and foreign banks had good appetite, so the situation gradually stabilized. It is estimated that Chinese banks East Asia, Continental, and Overseas Chinese successively sold spot British gold to foreign banks at 3 pence 4375, and spot US dollars at 6 yuan 6875. At the noon close, the bank's selling prices were 3 pence 4375 for spot British gold, and 6 yuan 6875 for US dollars.

The futures market trend was even looser

After the market, the Chinese bank East Asia first sold spot British gold to foreign banks at 3 pence 4375. Then, a bank blocked a Chinese merchant's September British gold at 3 pence 0625. Later, the Chinese merchant wanted to sell September, but the bank's asking price was only 3 pence 125, so the transaction did not go through. Later, a Chinese merchant sold spot US dollars to a foreign bank for as high as 6 yuan 8125, so the process futures were extremely firm. At the evening close, the bank's spot and this month's selling prices were 3 pence 46875 for British gold, and 6 yuan 75 for US dollars. September British gold was 3 pence 0625, and US dollars were 5 yuan 9375. As a result, compared to last Saturday, spot British was 0.046875 looser, US dollars were 0.09375 firmer, this month's British long was 109375 tighter, US dollars were 21875 firmer, September British was 0.078125 cheaper, and US dollars were 0.15625 looser. It is heard that after the close, Western merchant Sassoon and Holland successively sold spot British gold to British banks at 3 pence 46875, and US dollars at 6 yuan 75. Finally, it was heard that spot British gold was traded at 3 and a half pence.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Also Fell

Hong Kong, 21st telegram, today's exchange market opened steadily, and British, American, and Japanese exchange rates were still stable. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 4 yuan compared to Saturday, to 427 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the Shanghai exchange rate fell by 7 yuan, to 420 yuan. At 11:35 AM, the Shanghai exchange rate fell another 2 yuan, to 418 yuan. The noon close was soft. Spot US dollars were 0.0625 tighter, at 28 yuan 4375, and forward opened at 28 yuan 375.

The Japanese exchange rate was 25 tighter, at 104 yuan 125. There were no changes until the close.

### Unstable European Situation Leads to Gold Market Decline

Yesterday, the spot gold market saw a situation of rising and falling prices. In the end, the price continued to decrease by ten yuan. Initially, due to tight and weak foreign exchange rates, people's confidence increased, causing sellers to wait and see. The opening price in the morning was as high as 4,600 yuan. Later, due to strong buying from Hong Kong, the price quickly rose to a peak of 4,635 yuan. Subsequently, due to balanced supply and demand, the price fluctuated between 4,610 and 4,620 yuan. Around 10:30 AM, news of a recovery in foreign exchange rates emerged. This suddenly led to a lack of buyers, and securities firms and certain gold dealers rushed to sell for profit, causing the market price to plunge to 4,555 yuan. The price recovered to 4,570 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, due to strong buying interest from money exchange businesses, the price briefly rose again to 4,590 yuan. However, due to reports of a loosening of foreign exchange rates, selling pressure resurfaced. Securities firms and certain gold dealers resumed selling, causing the price to fall to a low of 4,535 yuan. The closing price for the evening was 4,545 yuan. Given the tense situation in Europe and the stalemate between Britain and Japan, any hope for an increase in price seems unlikely. The total trading volume for the day was over a thousand taels. There were no significant gains or losses for gold jewelry retailers. The prices of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Falls by Ten Yuan

Since the morning, the price per bar (ten taels) initially rose due to reports of a shrinking foreign exchange rate, boosting confidence and causing sellers to wait and see. When trading opened at 9:25 AM, the price surged by 45 yuan. Money exchange businesses sold 20 taels to gold dealers at a price of 4,600 yuan. After opening, certain jewelers and gold dealers vigorously bought around 200 taels on behalf of Hong Kong, causing the price to surge by 35 yuan. Jewelers sold 30 taels to a gold dealer at a price of 4,635 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange rate leveled off, and a certain gold dealer dumped gold on behalf of speculators. Soon after, the price fell by 32 yuan. Money exchange businesses traded 20 taels among themselves at 4,603 yuan. Afterward, a certain money exchange business showed strong buying interest, briefly pushing the price back up to 4,635 yuan. After this, due to balanced supply and demand, the price fluctuated between 4,610 and 4,620 yuan. Around 10:50 AM, news of a loosening foreign exchange rate triggered selling pressure. Securities firms, fund dealers, and spot traders all rushed to sell, causing the market to weaken and plunge by dozens of yuan. A certain Yu dealer bought 30 taels from a spot gold dealer at a price of 4,555 yuan. Later, a certain gold dealer, seeking profits, bought again, stabilizing the market. A gold dealer bought 50 taels from a jeweler at 4,570 yuan, setting the noon closing price. The market opened relatively flat in the afternoon. Initially, a gold dealer sold 20 taels to a money exchange business at the same price of 4,570 yuan. Later, money exchange businesses showed strong buying interest, and Hong Kong also bought slightly, causing the price to rise by 20 yuan. Money exchange businesses traded 30 taels among themselves at a price of 4,590 yuan. Reports of loosening foreign exchange rates, both spot and forward, coupled with securities firms and certain gold dealers (on behalf of speculators) resuming selling, soon caused the price to plunge by 55 yuan. A gold dealer sold 10 taels to a money exchange business at a price of 4,535 yuan. Afterward, money exchange businesses traded 30 taels among themselves at 4,545 yuan, setting the evening closing price. The result was a drop of ten yuan compared to the end of last week. The price fluctuated by hundreds of yuan throughout the day. Spot gold dealers sold their own branded gold at a price ten yuan higher. Spot standard gold was priced 65 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but there were few reported transactions.

Gold Jewelry Prices Rise and Then Level Off

For gold jewelry, the initial selling price at large jewelry stores remained at 460 yuan per tael. Around 9:35 AM, the price increased by five yuan, and then fell by five yuan around 3:35 PM in the afternoon. In the end, there was no change. Large jewelry stores still listed the price at 460 yuan, while newer stores listed it at 458 yuan. The buying price decreased by about 20 yuan.

Sino-British Pure Gold Prices Remain Unchanged

The Central Bank's announced market prices remained unchanged. This was due to a London telegram from the 19th, stating that the price of British pure gold remained at seven pounds, eight shillings, and seven pence per ounce.

Hong Kong Dollar Plummets by One Dime and Two Cents

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw the foreign exchange market loosen in the afternoon. Spot gold also rose and then fell. British and American gold pounds declined from high prices. The market loosened and prices decreased. There was substantial trading in British and American gold certificates, but the result was a slight decrease. Due to the severe situation in Hong Kong and scarce demand, there was heavy selling of Hong Kong dollars, causing a significant decrease in price. The market for Singapore dollars was weak. Philippine dollars decreased along with the weakening US dollar. The price of Japanese gold certificates initially rose to 1.2 yuan, but then fell back to 1.18 yuan, resulting in no change. Korean dollars were scarce, causing the market to rise to equal the value of the national currency. The supply and demand of other currencies was not strong, and the market saw no significant gains or losses. The Bankers' Association did not conduct any trading. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds and British gold certificates each decreased by one yuan. US gold certificates decreased by five cents. Hong Kong dollars decreased by one dime and two cents. French franc certificates decreased by six li. Singapore dollars decreased by one dime. Canadian dollars decreased by two dimes. The prices of all other currencies remained unchanged.

Discount Rate Suddenly Increases

Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts and bills of exchange suddenly increased again. Initially, it was 192.5 yuan per thousand yuan. Then, it briefly fell to 188 yuan, but soon rose sharply to 195 yuan by noon. In the afternoon, it continued to rise to a final rate of 197.5 yuan, an increase of 7.5 yuan compared to last Saturday. The money industry association's overnight interest rate opened at 1.7 cents in both the morning and afternoon.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Weaken Again, Foreign Stocks Also Show Widespread Sharp Declines

The securities market weakened again yesterday. Type C bonds broke through 40 yuan. The lack of confidence was partly due to the gradually escalating British-Japanese conflict and partly due to the increasingly tense situation in Europe. Those taking long positions inevitably had reservations. However, the fundamentals remained solid as ever. Like being frightened by one's own shadow, people were needlessly panicking. The bond market fluctuated and oscillated, largely driven by psychological factors. However, with limited table space and major players holding back, there was no power to push prices up. Most of those with strong financial resources have already left to wait for the right opportunity. The majority believe that it is not too late to take long positions again if peace is hopeful. Therefore, the rebound of public bonds is still uncertain. Yesterday's trading volume was relatively high, but market prices remained weak. Yongkang, Yongda, Maotai, Lianhe all saw selling. Dafeng, Hongkang, Dakangcheng, Lianyi, and Hengzheng all saw buying. Market prices fluctuated between two and three jiao. In the end, the prices fell by a small two to six jiao. The total trading volume was estimated at five to six hundred thousand yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

Stock Trading: 40 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of 47 yuan each.

Furthermore, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that the market was filled with selling pressure and prices generally declined sharply. The tension in Europe and the deteriorating domestic situation were sufficient to agitate people and cause the market to suffer a blow. The short-term market trends will depend on the ebb and flow of these forces. The largest price decreases were seen in:

Electricity Public Bonds, which fell slightly to 72.5 yuan. Furthermore, those generally involved in foreign exchange trading needed to deal with a large amount of cash to pay for bills of exchange due at the end of this month. Therefore, some had to sell their stocks in order to cash out.

Although investors had available capital, they were also waiting to see if political difficulties could be resolved and potentially lower prices might appear.

### Cotton Yarn: Hong Kong Buyers Aggressively Search, New Brand Yarn Remains Weak

The yarn market remained stable, trending towards a holding pattern. Hong Kong buyers were eagerly searching for 20-count "Teyi Yucheng Shuangma" brand yarn. Therefore, although negative news loomed, the market was able to maintain its support. However, the new brand yarn market remained weak and sluggish. It was difficult for customers to sell it, relying only on general industry transactions. Therefore, the market was difficult to consolidate. The "Shenxin No. 9 Factory" produced "20-count Shuangma" yarn, which was unusually popular and sold at high prices. The "No. 2 Factory" produced "20-count Tiannv" yarn, which had a narrow market and sold for more than 100 yuan cheaper.

In the morning, yarn traders gathered to discuss that the yarn market might have a small rebound. This was due to the serious situation at the Hong Kong border. Trading opened at 9:30 AM. "20-count Shuangdiqiu" yarn fell by three or four yuan, and other yarns also weakened. Soon after, with Guangbang still having a buying appetite for "Shuangma" yarn, the market did not loosen, but instead saw an increase in prices. The opening price was 775 yuan. This stabilized people's confidence. There were no major changes in the middle of the day. A half-day transaction statistic of 1,540 packages was checked. The market: "20-count Shuangma" yarn rose by four yuan, "Muyang" yarn rose by two yuan, "Tiannv" yarn fell by three yuan, and "Shuangdiqiu" yarn fell by three yuan. Today, 57 pieces were shipped to Yantai. The amount bought by each gang is listed on the left.

### Foreign Cotton Trading: Gradually Becoming Lively, High-Grade American Cotton Traded Yesterday

The domestic cotton market remained in a dull state. However, Indian cotton showed a continuous pattern. Prices did not differ much from the previous day. Most of the transactions were among traders. Only the Chinese "Yong'an Factory" bought 300 packages of "Pingguo Er" cotton at a price of 112 yuan. The rest of the transactions were among traders. The "Defeng Factory" bought 130 packages of "Huanghua Daba" cotton at a price of 98 yuan (sent to the factory via bank transfer). 425 packages of "Subao Laiyuan Daotong" cotton arrived. The asking price is listed below.

Another report stated that foreign cotton trading in Shanghai had turned lively. However, there were no large transactions. This was due to the lack of inventory in Shanghai. Most traders did not intend to sell their goods for the time being. They were waiting to see if there would be any changes in the customs duties in early September and holding a wait and see attitude towards the exchange rate. It was reported that some high-grade long-staple American cotton was traded yesterday. The price was around 210 yuan.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was very uneven. Initially, prices rose by three or four pounds due to good news from Liverpool and purchases from overseas cotton merchants. Later, prices fell due to an increase in short selling and favorable weather reports from the southern cotton regions, as well as spot traders dumping their goods. In the end, the closing price was four or five pounds lower than the previous day. The Indian and Egyptian markets were closed. It was predicted that the Indian market would fall by half a rupee.

### Oilseed Cakes: Appalling Oil Prices, Soybean Oil Highest at 60 Yuan, Raw Oil at 76.5 Yuan

Yesterday, trading in the miscellaneous grains and oilseed cake market was shocking and terrifying, no less than the gold market. A gang of lunatics were treating people's food as if it were standard gold, creating an unprecedented high price and making it impossible for people to afford even the most basic standard of living. This is truly heartbreaking. Yesterday, peanut oil soared by eight or nine yuan, reaching a highest price of 76.5 yuan. Soybean oil rose again by five or six yuan, reaching a highest price of 60 yuan. Yellow beans rose by two or three yuan, reaching a highest price of 17 yuan. High-quality broad beans rose by one yuan. Spot beans rose again by three or four jiao. Red beans rose by eight jiao. Peas rose by four jiao. Although other items were not traded, they all showed potential for soaring prices.

One thousand barrels of tung oil came from Tianjin on the 19th, and two thousand barrels will arrive on the 21st.

### Grains: Rice Prices Rise Higher and Higher, Up Another Five or Six Yuan Compared to Before the Suspension, Social Order Should Also be Noted

"Dugeng" rice: After the market management committee announced a three-day suspension, the supply from various sources loosened slightly. A total of over 40 businesses from Hexia, Songjiang, and Nangang arrived, bringing over 2,000 packages of "che-lun bao-zi" rice. The market management committee attempted to curb the rising prices, undertaking registration to investigate inventory. However, the market surge became even more intense. It was said that stores had exhausted their reserves and were urgently restocking, causing them to compete to buy at high prices. Although a large quantity of goods arrived, the demand still exceeded the supply, creating unprecedented high prices, up a significant five or six yuan compared to before the suspension. "Gaoxi Geng" rice opened at 38.5 yuan, medium "jue" rice at 37 to 36 yuan, "Changzhou Geng" rice opened at 37 to 38 yuan, "Su-Tong-Kun Geng" rice at 37 yuan, "Hexia" early and late rice opened at 35 to 36 yuan, "bao-zi" rice at 37 yuan, high-quality "Wu-Jian" rice at 34 yuan, and "jue" rice at 31 yuan. The total trading volume in the city was over 16,000 packages. At these rice prices, approaching 40 yuan, the lives of ordinary people are becoming increasingly difficult, and social order may be affected. It is hoped that those involved in the rice business will also consider the overall situation. The concession authorities should quickly seek to clear supply routes to alleviate the food shortage and stabilize the people.

"Kexian" rice: Yesterday, buying sentiment became even stronger. New shipments from Chinese merchants were quickly sold out. The over 10,000 packages of new shipments that arrived in the past few days were all in warehouses in Hongkou. Therefore, selling prices rose higher and higher. "Jing-Wu-Xian" rice all opened at a high of 33 to 34 yuan. However, in the afternoon, news emerged that over 6,000 packages of rice stored in Hongkou could be shipped out, and the authorities were also working to clear the supply routes, which might gradually unblock the supply. Therefore, people's confidence also recovered slightly. Additionally, 1,500 packages of new "Jiangbei" rice arrived and sold for 34 yuan.

Foreign Rice: Because the orders were not large, the surge in people's prices could not be suppressed. Yesterday, new Saigon rice opened at 38 yuan, but the seller still wanted to raise the price and was unwilling to continue selling.

### Flour Follows Rice Prices, Up Another Two Jiao

Wheat Flour: Yesterday was the beginning of the week. The spot flour trading market was lively. As rice prices had repeatedly surged in recent days, more and more citizens turned to eating flour. The demand on this street increased daily. The total daily trading volume was 20,000 packages. The "No. 2 Flour Factory" changed its price to 6.2 yuan in cash, up another two jiao compared to the end of last week. It was reported that merchants were selling quickly, and the factories were still halting sales. Currently, the flour price is still cheaper than rice, so囤户s are paying attention. Regrettably, factory limits were being applied. Returning warehouse goods were more advantageous, with selling prices exceeding the factory prices by two jiao.

Wheat: Yesterday's trend was rising. Although arrivals in Shanghai were continuous, there were repeated rumors of blockades in the inland producing areas. Therefore, sellers were all hoarding goods. Due to the daily increase in flour sales on this street, factories also strongly stocked up on raw materials.囤户s and Japanese factories also continuously absorbed goods. The market rose three jiao compared to last weekend. The "Fufu" and "Liang" factories purchased a total of 413 truckloads of wheat from Wuxi, Puzhen, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Pudong, etc. The highest purchase price was 9.2 yuan. The "Yuanhu" factory purchased 20 truckloads of wheat from Guandian, Suzhou, Kunshan, Changzhou, etc. The highest price was 9.7 yuan.

### Woolen Fabrics: Long-Haired Velvet Looking Good

The woolen fabric market was unusually tense yesterday. Prices for all kinds of goods were rising. Exchange rate fluctuations had a major impact on the woolen fabric industry. For example, long-haired velvet (called "Motaike" by Western tailors and "Haibailong" by female tailors) saw the greatest fluctuations. The difference in cost per case was 1,600 yuan, which was rare in the woolen fabric industry over the years. Yesterday, there was intra-industry trading of this type of long-haired velvet, with three cases changing hands at a price of 22.5 yuan per yard, net price. At this price of 22.5 yuan, if the exchange rate had been secured at 6.5 pence, each case could earn 800 yuan. If the exchange rate had not been secured and was calculated at the current rate of 3.75 shillings, each case would lose 800 yuan. As a result, most people were optimistic about rising prices. The public teahouse had been calling out a price of 23.5 yuan up and down. Most people were only selling entire cases and were unwilling to open cases to sell individual yards.

### Sugar Market: National Sugar Sees Repeated High Prices

Yesterday, the price of national sugar continued to rise. For example, "Zu San Jian Bai" sugar was selling for 55 yuan, and the factory was still offering 53 yuan without success. 41 packages of ordinary "Mianchi" sugar also reached the 40 yuan level. 120 packages of "Chongti Qing" sugar reached 38.7 yuan. Over 700 packages of "Youbao Chen Hainanchi" sugar reached 23.8 yuan. "Hainan Yang" sugar was even calling out 44 yuan. According to telegrams from Hesu, the price of foreign sugar continued to loosen slightly. December sugar was selling for 5 shillings and 11.5 pence. Next March sugar was selling for 6 shillings, and June sugar was selling for 6 shillings and 0.75 pence. According to telegrams from Hong Kong, coarse sand sugar was selling for 8 Hong Kong dollars. In the Bankers' Association trading, the market tightened again. Spot 24 coarse white sugar rose by half a yuan. This warehouse was priced at 40.8 yuan, and other warehouses were priced at 5 jiao. Re-exported sugar was priced at 32.5 yuan. Taigu "Chebai" sugar rose by 3 jiao. East warehouse "B Mark" sugar was priced at 44.5 yuan, and West warehouse was priced at 44.7 yuan. The prices of the remaining marks were reduced accordingly. "H Mark Chechi" sugar rose by half a yuan to 28 yuan. Hesu red sugar rose by one yuan to 36 yuan. Re-exported sugar was priced at 29.5 yuan. This "Mianbai Zhenji No. 1" sugar was priced at 41 yuan, and "No. 1 Bing" sugar was priced at 45.5 yuan. "Jingming Bing" sugar was priced at 47 yuan. Furthermore, 215 packages of red and white sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday, and 200 packages arrived from Xiamen.

### Piece Goods: Many Factory Cloths, Factory Stops Work and Reduces Work, National Cloth

Actual sales were weak. The price of goods relied on the higher prices of factory futures for motivation to gradually rise. Hand goods opened at lower prices. Dyeing and weaving factories faced costs that were higher than sales prices, and sales routes were shrinking daily. Therefore, the number of factories that stopped work and reduced work was increasing daily. Yesterday, the price of dyed cloth and velvet hand goods each rose by another 3 jiao. The rising trend was still weak, and the gap with factory prices was still large. For example, "Lunchang Yuanyu Silk" was ordered at a factory price of 25 yuan on the 15th, but the market price only rose from 19 yuan on the 14th to 20 yuan currently. White goods, such as "dyebai xiexiao," had slightly more activity in sales. The price of "shiliubang cu-bu cu-xiexiao shou-huo ezi duanxi" each rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao and a half. The actual sales to the Nanyang gang included 5,000 pieces of "piaobu se xiexiao piaoxiexiao huabu" goods. Sales to the Guangdong and Hong Kong gang were slightly weaker. The Mushi Street dyeing factory and wholesale dealers purchased over 300 pieces of white cloth gray cloth and printed cloths. The Yong gang purchased over 100 pieces of dyed cloth se xiexiao printed cloth velvet cu-bu. The Beilu Yantai gang purchased 2,500 pieces of "Yihuo mian." The texture of soft "weru xiexiao" was solid.

Dongpi

The texture of fine cloth soft "xeruxi xiexiao shu" The sales of guest cloths was quiet yesterday, the dye factory stocks were strong, and the requirement of thin "xiexiao" gray cloth increased extremely. The sale disk of the close of the weekend compared to thin gray cloth dropped back to 2 jiao half per "pi", while "xiexiao" went back and improved 1 to 2 jiao. The goods for sale of "shier-bang longtou xibu" was priced at 18 yuan and 7 jiao half currently. The Beibang had no trade, and sales from the seller were also rare. However, this street's dye factory and the "sebu pi-fa-hao" bought 600 pieces of white cloth.

Export

22nd: 10 pieces were transported to Qihai Shu, and 32 pieces were transported to Yantai.

### Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Traded After the 15th, Exports Will be Inspected, Another Obstacle for the Silk Industry

This spring, the Shanghai silk industry's prices surged drastically due to the constant reduction of foreign exchange, up to the 4,000 yuan mark. At first glance, silk factories make profit, but this is now an unprecedented difficulty that is becoming increasingly severe, such as the spring silkworms in inland purchasing which have never come to Shanghai in bulk. Yesterday's silk market has already revealed the so-called "Ministry of Industry Raw Silk Inspection Office" published raw silk inspection measures. According to the contents of the "Detailed Rules", raw silk transactions after the 15th of this month must be sent to the office for verification and obtain an export certificate before customs clearance and export, just like the authority exercised by the Commodity Inspection Bureau before the war. Now, according to the silk tycoons who spoke with reporters, if the Shanghai silk industry compromises to this move, there will be many obstacles in the future, which is difficult to predict. This is because the "Ministry of Industry Raw Silk Inspection Office" move is the first step in controlling the entire Shanghai silk industry. It is said that this move also endangers the commercial interests of third countries. It is also said that this move will definitely not be approved by the foreign merchant silk industry and all Shanghai silk factories, so exports will be unimpeded. How determined the export merchants and silk manufacturers of this port are will determine (Xiang).

### European and American Silk Sales: Relatively Inferior, Indian and Philippine Transactions are Busy

Yesterday, overseas silk industry, New York weekday market off, Yokohama situation was weak, spot 1220 yuan, down 15 yuan, near term 1201 yuan, down 7 yuan, far term 1146 yuan, down 6 yuan, England and France silk telegrams were without inquiry because of the tense European situation. It is important for this port's foreign firms and factories to trade in a quiet way due to the weakness of overseas silk prices. However, this port's silk industry export procedures will have special obstacles, making the silk market temporarily wait and see. The domestic silk transactions are not yet the focus of a certain party's attention, so the silk sales to Japan, India, and the Philippines are quite busy. It is estimated that banks such as "Baitou Hangjia Sanxing Xinda" made large transactions, and transactions in Muzhen, Xiangshan, and Jinfo grades were 20 dan, Qianjin silk Jindin, Jinfeng grades were 80 dan, the market price rose by 10 yuan or so compared to the previous. Therefore, in yesterday's silk market, European and American silk sales were inferior in comparison.

### Coal: White Coal Fines and Aberdeeens are Increasingly Popular

Hongji white coal fines, the stock of goods here is only 8,000 to 9,000 tons, and the source is not wide, it is sold as soon as it arrives, not enough for distribution, but the demand for small coal briquette factories is very high, so the market situation is strong, the dark plate is increasingly popular, Hongji No. 1 fines are 52 yuan per ton, No. 2 fines are 46 yuan, retail in Menzhuang, No. 1 is 2 yuan and 8 jiao per unit, No. 2 is 2 yuan and 5 jiao.

### Seafood: Western Sea Cucumber Frequently Rises

The source of Western dried sea cucumber is desolate, which leads to gradual thinness of the underlying storage, the market price was sold at 88 yuan before, and then rose to 110 yuan. As the route is not weakened, it is now calling out at a high of 125 yuan, and the momentum is strong. The domestic "Xining Zidan" near the city is still 115 yuan, but the lack of "dase" is extreme. Only a small number of unified goods arrived the day before yesterday, which were sold at 160 yuan after Yuan Dan and Sanjiao Gong pulled.

### Active Symbolism

— Pinpin

When I discussed the creative method of "Salted Pork Soup Stewed Tofu" before, I said at the end of the article: "The soul of mastering this creative method is symbolism (active). I may have the opportunity to talk about it." Here, let's discuss this issue.

Symbolic literature is divided into two types, namely negative and positive. The negative type seeks symbolism in expression, and many poets of the late nineteenth century, such as Baudelaire, Mallarmé, Verlaine, and Rimbaud, belong to this school. The positive type seeks symbolism in the subject matter, and its expression does not require ambiguous, neurotic fantasies, or strange things. Therefore, negative symbolism is just the application of rhetoric, which is completely different from positive symbolism.

In Europe, positive symbolism has been advocated very early. For example, Plato said, "Art is acceptable, but it must be related to the progress of the country and must express noble emotions." Aristotle recognized that music has educational and ethical value. This kind of literature was the most developed in the Middle Ages, because religion was in power, and all literature had to symbolize religious concepts, and works such as "Patience", "Everyone", and "Humanity" and other dramas. When it came to Schlegel, he said it even more forcefully. He said that the value of art lies in having meaningful content. Hegel also advocated this, believing that art is the same as religion and philosophy, art is the teacher of the people, and it represents the spiritual value of the people's lives. We can summarize in one sentence: critics of the classical system advocate positive symbolism (or the usefulness of literature); critics of the romantic system advocate negative symbolism (the uselessness of literature).

Speaking of the development of positive symbolism, in addition to the most developed Middle Ages, there were already some in Greece and Rome, such as Hesiod in Greece and Lucanus in Rome. In the eighteenth century, the authors of the French Encyclopedia School, such as Voltaire, also wrote for a kind of abstract thought. The most compatible with this standard in the nineteenth century was Maeterlinck, whose "The Blue Bird" and other works are famous for this.

Positive symbolism is almost indistinguishable from realism, the only difference is that the former uses suggestion and the latter uses exposure. Many people regard positive symbolism as "allegorical", which is wrong, first, allegories belong to one category (common fairy tales), and second, allegories do not express profound thoughts: to see this distinction, we only need to compare Maeterlinck's "The Blue Bird" with La Fontaine's works (the best allegories).

If we already know that positive symbolism I mean subject matter, then the characteristics of this doctrine are easy to recognize. I think the statement in "The Book of Changes" is the simplest and most pertinent: "The purpose is subtle, the words are plain, and the meaning is hidden in the matter." Liu Zhiji's words in "Shitong" can be used as a supplement: "The words are near and the meaning is far, the words are shallow and the meaning is deep? Although the final words have been exhausted, the connotation has not been exhausted: so that the reader can know the inside by looking at the outside, and distinguish the bones by touching the hair, and see one thing in the words, and return the three corners from the words." This is a success that is not easy to achieve, so Liu Zhiji said: "Therefore, those who browse it initially suspect it is easy, but those who love it can see its difficulty. It is certainly not something that can be done by carving insects."

Liu Xie's "Wen Xin Diao Long" has a chapter on "Metaphor and Allegory" which is very detailed, and the summary has the following sentences: "... the name is small, but the classification is big..., and what is meant by comparison? It is to write things to attach meaning, and to use speech to cut things. Therefore, gold and tin are used to describe bright virtues, jade and zhang are used to describe outstanding people, leaf-cutter bee are used to classify teaching, cicadas and locusts are used to write slogans... All of these cut images are the meaning of comparison."

Therefore, now, because of environmental factors, if we use symbolism to write articles, we must use positive symbolism, and we must avoid using arbitrary and trivial symbolism, because the latter will put readers in a fog, not only will they not get a deep impression, but even the understanding of the War of Resistance will be neglected and confused. This is not an easy method, it may be more difficult than writing realism. But in an environment like Shanghai, what better creative method is there besides positive symbolism?

### Nameless Old Professor

— Saint Dan

— War Zone Notes

Speaking of political work in the war zone, it seems there haven't been any particularly outstanding achievements in Anhui. Especially in the seven counties of western Anhui, although many educated youths were mobilized, the results were quite ordinary. Even before the fall of Lu'an, "signals" were inevitably discovered in the suburbs, leaving the fighters at the front no time to attend to them, ultimately forcing them to retreat under fire. This illustrates that political work cannot coordinate with military operations, but instead weakens the strength of the war. It's truly heartbreaking to say. Who should bear the responsibility for this irreparable situation? The lack of widespread education is certainly one reason, but the superficiality and rigidity of the work are also major errors. "To do political work in the war zone, you must adapt your methods according to the person, the place, the event, and the time. Otherwise, it's all in vain." This was Luo Qing's proposition. Therefore, from Anqing to western Anhui, he corrected his previous mistakes based on the lessons learned from experience. However, when I returned to the Dabie Mountains, he had already gone to Jinan.

"If you had come a month earlier, you could have met him," said Di Chaobai regretfully, when I was talking to him at the Provincial Mobilization Committee. This revolutionary youth, who grew up in Jiangnan, had just left student life at the National Central University in Nanjing and came here to take over Luo Qing's work, and he was certainly up to the task.

"His courage to go to the occupied areas is admirable!" I praised him wholeheartedly.

"Well, if he can go, can't we?" Old Mr. Ren Chonggao suddenly interjected.

"Yes, we should do that."

Old Mr. Ren is a 64-year-old professor with a thin face and a sparse tuft of long beard on his chin. He walked from Changsha to Hankou, and then from Hankou to western Anhui, bravely participating in political work in the war zone. To draft a rural propaganda plan, he buried himself under the dim light of an oil lamp for two hours, still so energetic, showing no signs of fatigue. I remember once, planes bombed around him, and everyone hid in air raid shelters, but he continued to work as if nothing had happened.

"If the brothers on the front lines," he said solemnly, "have to be busy dodging planes, how can they fight?" That's how he explained his reasoning. Truly, every action of his moved, excited, and even inspired people to learn. Then, he told me that he would soon set off for the front, because after the fall of Dongwangdian, the enemy troops had crossed Sujiabu and were advancing rapidly towards Dushan. If Mapu were in danger, the eastern front would become even more tense.

"What about you?" Finally, he asked for my agreement.

"Of course, we all go together!" My resolve.

### Early Morning Journey

— Zheng Hua

At dawn, I left an isolated village by the sea, looking back with lingering feelings at the footprints I left there, gradually being covered by wind and sand.

Gu—Dung, Gu—ung I sat on a wheelbarrow, heading towards the rising sun, rolling over the wheat fields shrouded in light smoke. The wheat had already been harvested, and tire tracks were densely imprinted on the cracked soil. Pushing it up the narrow and rugged ridges, the cart shook even more violently, and my buttocks rubbed against the hard wood of the cart, feeling very painful. The dense green sorghum on both sides grew taller than the pedestrians, and the wind blew it back and forth, constantly caressing the corners of my clothes with its tender leaves.

When we reached the vast wilderness, the road was a bit flatter. But the wind was very strong, whipping up the sand and dust from the ground, and rushing over in waves, like thick yellow snakes writhing and swirling. My eardrums, nostrils, and teeth were all filled with grains of sand and dust. My sleeves and trouser legs were even more invaded by a large amount of dust and sand. I tightly closed my eyelids, brushed the dust off my face, and felt an unusual stuffiness in my chest.

Gu—Dung, Gu—ung The wheelbarrow driver pushed, panting, and the beads of sweat on his forehead dripped onto my back. The heavy sound of the cart, heard in a heavy mood, felt even heavier.

The clear sound of cicadas spread around, and we sat in the shade of a pine tree to rest. The driver wiped his chest and back with a piece of blue cloth. Sweat and dust mingled and stuck to his bronze-colored face, and the veins on his sturdy arms were full of blue veins, twitching from time to time. I patted the thick layer of dust that had accumulated on my body, but the wind blew it up again, covering my body like a layer of smoke.

"What's your name? It seems like I know you very well," I asked.

"Sir, I was the one who pushed you away during the retreat last year. You asked me my name then. My surname is Chen, Chen from Erdong Chen."

"Oh! Yes, I remember."

"You used to have a very straightforward partner, didn't you?" I continued to ask.

"Alas! He went to Liutao with the army on the second day of last month and was blown up along with the customers!"

My nerves suddenly vibrated, and painful memories surged up!

"Sir, wasn't there another gentleman who left with you last year?"

"He also died! Although he wasn't killed by a bomb, he was ruined and had to run around. He died of typhoid fever on the road…"

As I spoke, I raised my head and looked at the distance. I heard him cursing bitterly, and I slowly shifted my gaze and saw his two sweeping eyebrows twitching in curves, and the lines on his forehead had become deeper.

"Damn it! That bastard, one day, one day he will…" He widened his eyes, like red-hot charcoal, and roared.

"Let's go! If we arrive at Batan Town early, I still want to see the situation there after the disaster!"

Gu—Dung, Gu—ung The sound of the cart seemed even heavier, and I raised my head again to look at the long sky… and then slowly turned my head back to look at him.

### What Audacity!

— Zhou Lihua

### Ode to the Heroic Warrior

— Yun Hen

On the grasslands at the foot of the Taihang Mountains,

You uphold your shared hatred with courage,

Your arduous work will never be in vain,

The flame of the nation will spread across the wilderness.

Stepping on the sharp steel,

Watch the darkness slip away at the gunpoint.

The vast sky will quietly

Speak the words in your heart:

The victorious tomorrow is coming.

Wipe your eyes with your blood-stained hands,

The towering Taihang Mountains stand before you,

The bright flag flies in the air.

Set up the cannons, fix the bayonets,

You must shoot accurately and advance bravely.

The song of freedom is sung loudly,

The waters of the Yellow River surge and surge,

The earth is stirred by the symphony of battle,

Heroic warriors, we must be even braver.

Arts and Entertainment World

### Introducing a New Batch of Performers at the Xin Sheng Stage (Part 2)

— Wei Wo

Li Duokui

Li Duokui is the only talented laodan (old female role) performer in the Peking opera world today. Duokui originally studied the xusheng (male with beard) role, but later studied with Lu Yanting, the qin player of the late famous laodan Gong Yunfu, and began to learn laodan. Lu Yanting, also known as Lu Wu, was a famous qin player in the north and followed Ji Chu (Gong Yunfu's nickname) for many years. Therefore, he had a good understanding of Gong Chu's singing style. After teaching it to Li, Li indirectly gained the legacy of Ji and became Gong's successor. Duokui's voice is very powerful, and his appearance also fits the laodan role, so he became popular. After Gong Chu's death, Song Jie Mei, known as Wo Yun Jushi (recluse cloud dweller), and Duokui formed a three-way division of power in the north's laodan scene. Now that Jie Mei has passed away and Wo Yun has retired due to ill health, Duokui has become a rare surviving figure. Duokui has been with Cheng Yanqiu's Cheng troupe for more than ten years. He left Cheng this spring and was not very successful in Beijing. Coming south this time will also give Duokui a very good opportunity.

Zhou Weijun

This is an unfamiliar name. Zhou Weijun plays the xiaosheng (young male) role and is one of the rising xiaosheng talents in the north. However, Weijun is not a true "Beijing product". He has been in the south for a long time and is the younger brother of Zhou Wenyi. Last year, he went north and, through the introduction of female performer Wang Yurong, became a student of the veteran performer Jin Zhongren. Under Zhongren's guidance, his art gradually became respectable, and he occupied a place among the rising xiaosheng performers in the north. Weijun resembles Yu Zhenfei in appearance, and his acting is not bad. He can be considered a talent of middling quality. He once performed with Wang Yurong's troupe in Beijing and later collaborated with female dan performers Wu Suqiu and Zhao Xiaolan. Now he has also been invited by the Xin Sheng authorities.

Wang Quankui

Wang Quankui was originally a ticket amateur in Beijing who sang the jing (painted face male) role with a powerful voice, and his singing was very moving. One year, Li Shengzao led the Shengjing brothers and disciples of the four Fu Liancheng disciplines to Shanghai to perform at the Tianchan Stage. Before the trip, they were short of a jing performer, so they asked Quankui to join them. Quankui then changed his name to Shengkui and partnered with Shengzao in Shanghai in plays such as "Catching Cao" and "Scolding Cao," which were well received. Quankui is willing to study and has worked hard in recent years. His art has improved rapidly. The last time he came to Shanghai with Tan Fuying, he was very popular. After returning to the north, his pay increased from twelve yuan to sixteen yuan, which is highly valued by famous performers in general. Coming to Shanghai this time, he will undoubtedly become popular.

Zhang Chunyan

Zhang Chunyan was once known as one of the "Three Heroes of Lizi (inside the story)" along with Li Mingyu and Zhang Mingcai. After Mingyu and Mingcai passed away, Chunyan became the only remaining Lizi talent. His voice was once hoarse, but after recovering, he rejoined Cheng Yanqiu's Qiusheng Society, where Yanqiu regarded him as his right-hand man. Last year, he came to Shanghai with Yanqiu, and his voice was better than before. He had profound skills in the play "Huangjin Tie Fights Taiping." Chunyan is the teacher of xusheng Chen Shaolin. This time, because Shaolin was hired by the Xin Sheng Stage, he decided to come with Shaolin.

Sun Shengwu

Sun Shengwu is the younger brother of the jing performer Sun Shengwen. He and Guan Shengxi were outstanding talents in the chou (clown) role of the fourth Fu Liancheng discipline. Li Shengzao came to Shanghai for the second time and once brought Shengwu with him. However, Shengzao's second visit to Shanghai failed to draw a crowd, so Shengwu also failed to attract attention. Shengwu has clear diction and a resonant voice. He is good at playing funny roles, and his acting style is similar to that of Ma Fulu. His art is above that of Guan Shengji and on par with Ai Shiju, who came with Mao Shilai. He is a talented figure among the rising chou performers.

Wang Shengyi

Wang Shengyi studied at Fu Liancheng. During his time at the school, he, Zhong Shengzhen, Sun Zhaofang, and Liu Shenglian were known as the Four Heroes of Zhanhang and was originally a huadan (female) role talent. After graduating, he fell into bad habits and became frustrated. He collaborated with Gou Huisheng for a long time and once came to Shanghai with Gou, but later separated from Huisheng. It has been heard that Shengyi has overcome his bad habits. If he can truly recover like this, he will surely regain the heroic demeanor he had when he was studying at the school. After all, Shengyi's art is not weak.

Jia Duocai

Jia Duocai has now become a typical senior figure in the chou role team. Duocai initially followed Cheng Yanqiu and now assists Shang Xiaoyun. He is good at playing ugly old women and ugly maids and is known for his "eccentricity." Last time, he came south with Shang Xiaoyun, and readers may remember him.

In addition, it is reported that there are also wu sheng (martial male) Liang Huichao, as well as Li Shiqi and Gao Desong. I have never heard of Liang Huichao, and I don't know if he is a true "Beijing product." Li Shiqi is likely a member of the fifth Shi generation of Fu Liancheng. Gao Desong may be a student of a music school. I will ask the owner of the Plum Blossom Hall for information and then inform readers.

### Mid-Autumn Festival: "Shanghai Song" to Be Performed

The Unknown Society's "Shanghai Song" has been rehearsing for a long time in Fuxu Fang. Later, it was shelved because there was no venue for performances (negotiations with the Heguang Grand Theater were unsuccessful) and because actors such as Mei Xi, Xia Xia, and Bai Hong had busy filming schedules.

Recently, the Sino-French Theater Society dissolved, and the authorities at the front desk of Lafei were eager to find a troupe to perform. Therefore, there was a negotiation with the Unknown Society: that is, the outside rumor that Zhang Shichuan would perform for two months, and during these two months, the Unknown Society's "Shanghai Song" would also be one of the performing plays.

However, "Shanghai Song" is an opera. Although it has been rehearsed for a long time, there is no problem with time. All costumes and props need to be purchased with money, and a considerable sum is required. Now that it is going to be performed at Lafei, there must be a way to obtain this "capital." There are two rumors outside:

(1) A member persuaded a Mr. Xu to be willing to pay the money;

(2) The authorities at the front desk of Lafei are also willing to pay the money and even offer preferential terms, that is, when performing, the front desk will cover the backstage, two performances per day, totaling 250 yuan.

Regarding these two rumors, we do not know who Mr. Xu is, and how he is willing to pay this money is even more difficult to believe. As for the latter, the conditions are too preferential, and the front desk covering the backstage is a new record for theaters. Therefore, we will listen to these two rumors with a grain of salt, and the truth will be revealed in the future.

### Speaking of "Wang Baochuan":

— You Da

— Otherwise, I Wouldn't Want to Film at All

When Yihua Company was discussing the actors for "Wang Baochuan," the central figure of this "Wang Baochuan" had already been designated in red pen - the standard classical beauty Zhang Cuihong. The officials of Yihua believed that Zhang Cuihong was a former member of Yihua and that the relationship between the host and guest had always been very harmonious. Therefore, inviting her to star in "Wang Baochuan" was considered a sure thing. It was unexpected that everything was ready except for the east wind. Zhang Cuihong politely declined to star in "Wang Baochuan." This emergency really made the production director Yan Youxiang almost become Wu Zixu. He personally went out several times, but never met the ideal "Wang Baochuan." For this reason, he had to go to Hong Kong to find a way, which is the well-known incident of inviting Li Qinian to Shanghai.

Li Qinian could not come to Shanghai in the short term due to her contract in Hong Kong. In this way, Xue Pinggui's wife was again nowhere to be found. At this critical moment, Zhang Cuihong suddenly revealed a bit of news, saying that she felt very sorry for rejecting Yihua's kindness. When this news reached Yan Youxiang's ears, he knew there was still room for redemption, so he hurriedly rushed back to Shanghai and visited her again in the rain. Finally, all went well. Under Zhang Cuihong's words, "If it weren't for Mr. Yan's enthusiasm, I wouldn't want to film movies at all," "Wang Baochuan" was finally resolved.

Up to now, Zhang Cuihong has been working hard in the Yihua studio for more than a month. The play is very demanding, and Zhang Cuihong is also very energetic. Wu Cun said that if it weren't for Zhang Cuihong, it would have been a pity for this play to cost so much. After all, Zhang Cuihong is extraordinary. Mr. Yan's efforts have finally paid off, and the audience's eyes will also be blessed.

In this game, Pan Jun opened with Pawn 3 advancing 1 (commonly known as Immortal Pointing the Way), Xie Jun responded with Cannon 2 moving sideways to 7 (Over the Palace Cannon), and Xie's side's chariot 2 advancing 4 to extend the chariot. Pan's side used Cannon 8 moving sideways to 6 to counter the chariot. It seems that moving sideways to 7 would have been more aggressive. Soldier 7 advancing 1 seems to be able to gain the advantage on the surface, but in reality, it backfired, so it would be more practical to respond with the advisor first. The draw in this game, although due to Pan Jun's carelessness, is also due to Xie Jun's conservative and experienced play.

### Anecdotes from the Opera World

— Xu Muyun

Shaving and Hair Removal Are Two Major Pains for Performers

The opera business, on the surface, seems to earn thousands or tens of thousands, making it seem very comfortable, but in reality, it is not easy to do. Especially for those who play the painted-face role and the female role, there are two extremely painful and troublesome things that are inherent. These are related to physiological problems, and there is no artificial way to remedy them. One can only endure the pain and do it. Perhaps when medicine becomes more advanced in the future, it will be possible to use medicinal water to remove these annoying things, which would greatly benefit the jing and dan roles.

The jing role, whether it is the copper hammer, the framed painted face, the acrobatic second painted face, as well as the painted face characters who support the action and the famous performers who play the painted face roles in martial plays such as "Iron Dragon Mountain" and "Taking Gao Deng," must first shave the hair on the top of their heads clean and smooth like the skin before applying colored makeup. In this way, the colors can be applied with shine and beauty. If the actor is lazy and goes to apply makeup on the third day after shaving, then short hairs will have grown on the top of his head, and it will be very difficult to apply the colors upward, and the drawn face will not look very good. Moreover, the jing role uses the word "gou (drawing)" rather than "tu (applying)" or "yang (nourishing)" to describe the painting of various face masks, which shows that all jing performers must carefully draw and must not be sloppy. There are no less than hundreds of types of face masks in Chinese opera. The jing role, who occupies an important position in each play, must carefully draw the mask. The larger the forehead is opened, the more majestic and spectacular it appears. Except for those who support the martial roles, who constantly support several plays a day, and at the same time change their face masks several times, they have no choice but to perfunctorily finish the job, or even draw to the forehead and consider it done. All of the forehead part is almost abandoned and not drawn. All other roles must open the forehead wide and must draw to the top of the head in order to meet the conditions for drawing the face. Since one wants to meet these conditions and is unwilling to be perfunctory, the trouble of shaving every day becomes an unavoidable fact. (85)
