### Continuing Advances by Chinese Forces in Northern Hunan; Japanese Troops in Yueyang Show Signs of Wavering; Ammunition and Wounded Soldiers in the City Are Being Transported Onto Warships; Areas West of Wuning City Are Entirely Recaptured by Chinese Forces

Changsha – Chinese forces, after penetrating deeply into the vicinity of Yueyang, have launched continuous attacks on Yueyang in recent days, making considerable progress. The Japanese troops in the city are extremely panicked. In recent days, they have not only set fire to and burned all the mountains and forests near the suburbs, but have also dragged multiple field guns originally outside the city into the city. At the same time, they have forced civilians through the puppet maintenance association to transport all the stored ammunition in the city and more than fifty lightly and severely wounded soldiers from the Japanese wounded soldier hospital on Hanlin Street onto warships. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese troops in Yueyang are already showing signs of wavering. (Dispatch of the 26th)

### The Japanese Planes That Attacked Sichuan the Other Day Took Off from a Base in Shanxi; Several Bombs Were Dropped While Passing Through Shaanxi; The Chinese Side Is Conducting a Careful Study

Chongqing – According to Chinese sources, a careful study is being conducted regarding the flight path of the Japanese planes in northwestern Sichuan Province yesterday. It is now felt that Sichuan Province may face a new aerial threat. The Japanese previously used Hankou as an air force base to attack Chongqing and other cities in Sichuan Province. Last year, it was reported that Japanese naval aircraft took off from several bases off the coast of southern China and attacked Chongqing twice, but this was never confirmed. Yesterday, Japanese planes took off from a base in Shanxi Province and flew to northwestern Sichuan Province, revealing the possibility that Japanese planes could fly from the north to attack Chongqing. When the air raid alarm was issued in Chongqing yesterday afternoon, 36 Japanese planes took off from a base in Shanxi Province, crossed the Yellow River, flew southwest to Chengdu, then turned east, circled for a long time in Nanchuan, and finally returned to Shanxi via Yingshan and Bazhong. It is generally believed that the Japanese planes dropped bombs when they flew over Hanzhong, an important city in southwestern Shaanxi Province, before re-entering Sichuan, and that this was to explore the possibility of flying from the north to attack cities in Sichuan Province in the future. (Dispatch of the 26th by Reuters)

Chongqing – According to Chinese sources, Japanese planes bombed Hunan and Shaanxi yesterday. In the morning, five Japanese planes took off from a base in Hubei Province and bombed Yuanling in northwestern Hunan Province, dropping more than fifty bombs, mostly incendiary bombs, destroying two hundred houses. However, as of now, only twenty casualties have been reported. Shanzhou in Shaanxi Province was bombed by eight Japanese planes taking off from a base in Shanxi Province, dropping forty bombs and destroying thirty houses. Another group of nine Japanese bombers bombed Yingji (transliteration), reportedly dropping more than fifty bombs, destroying fifty houses and causing more than thirty casualties.

### The Occupied Areas Are Not Extensive

Chongqing – According to statistics released by the Executive Yuan today, the area truly occupied by Japanese troops in the occupied areas is extremely small. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, twelve provinces have fallen into the war zone, but in these twelve provinces, 97 percent of the land or counties are still under the control of the Chinese government. According to these twelve provinces, there are 1,038 counties, but only sixty-seven counties are beyond the reach of the Chinese government. (Dispatch of the 26th by the Associated Press)

### The Spirit of Cooperation Between the Army and Civilians in Hunan Is the Backbone of the War of Resistance; Observations of an Associated Press Reporter

Chongqing – A reporter recently went to Changsha to inspect the area and discovered that the Chinese army and civilians are prepared to cooperate to protect the most fertile Hunan River basin from the Miluo River to Hengyang. This area not only has a large military force and civilian manpower, but also has the most abundant harvest in agricultural history this year (sufficient for the province's use for two years, and also able to be transported to Guangxi and Guizhou), as well as a spirit of army-civilian cooperation that the reporter has not seen elsewhere. The combination of the three is more than enough to resist the Japanese army's invasion of the area. When the reporter inquired about the situation of the army and civilians from people from all walks of life, from the county magistrate to the farmer, they all expressed surprise and admiration for the bravery of the soldiers and unanimously expressed their willingness to cooperate with the army. Local farmers told Yu Sheng, "Chinese soldiers are our friends. They help us harvest in place of the labor of our sons who are away at war. When they live in civilian houses, the commanders pay rent." The development of this new spirit of the Chinese army has led the local industrial and agricultural sectors to automatically organize army-civilian cooperation groups to replace the previously forced labor groups. The reporter personally saw thousands of laborers, mostly from the fields, engaged in digging trenches, destroying roads, and transporting military supplies on the battlefield. Each group is commanded by a foreman, and the work is entirely undertaken by the local area. The Chinese army in the war zone only needs to notify the county magistrate of the matters to be done, and the county magistrate will recruit workers from the cooperative group. The work will begin in a few hours. Labor wages are paid from military expenses and provincial government funds. However, there are also civilians living in the occupied areas who voluntarily serve, and they provide their own food and do not receive wages. This kind of spirit has never been seen before. Rural life here is no different from before the war. Japanese air raids have completely changed urban life. The population of Hengyang has decreased from 200,000 to 60,000. Their lives are completely militarized. Civilians are not allowed to wander the streets from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Local farmers and merchants can only bring limited necessities to the market for sale to avoid losses during air raids. Before the alert time, the streets are filled with civilians fleeing to nearby exits and empty pits to avoid air raids. The local government has ordered all production enterprises to withdraw from the city walls and provide funding to re-establish new factories in rural Guangxi and Hunan. The situation in Guilin is also the same. A mile away from the city, there is a refugee camp outside Qixing Mountain. The underground caves formed by glaciers hundreds of years ago are used by the people of Guilin as natural shelters from Japanese air raids. The government has built four large houses in the caves, each 40 square feet. There is a kindergarten at one entrance, and all the children in the city must attend school. In the past few months, there have been fifty air raids, and only 130 civilians have been killed or injured. The reporter has seen officials, civilians, and soldiers of all levels in Hunan united and cooperating as solid as iron. Although the Japanese army still intends to attack Hunan Province in the coming months, the reporter is convinced that the local Chinese army and civilians, united and cooperating as never before, will be able to protect this famous rice-producing area of northern Hunan.

### Impressions of Foreign Reporters Inspecting the Traces of the Northern Hunan Battle

Nanyue – Mr. Billard of the Havas News Agency, Mr. Martin of the United Press, Mr. Situ of the Associated Press, Mr. Turdin of the New York Times, and Mr. Yexiaming of TASS, led by Deputy Minister Dong XianGuang of the Central Propaganda Department, went to various places in northern Hunan to inspect and have now successfully completed their mission. They flew from Guilin to Chongqing on the 25th. When Deputy Minister Dong and others set off, the reporter accompanied them part of the way and successively met with Director Bai, Commander Chen, Commander Xue, and others, inquiring in detail about the Northern Hunan victory. They then went to Jinjing, Fulinpu, Qingshan City, and other places to pay respects to the traces of the battle and conduct on-the-spot investigations of the atrocities of the Japanese army, and the impressions they gained were extremely profound. The foreign reporters expressed their feelings about the trip to Commander Xue. First, they praised the perfection of the transportation facilities in various places along the way. The reporter said that the Japanese side had repeatedly declared that the Northern Hunan victory reported by the Chinese side was not the case. After our on-the-spot inspection, we can answer that this is indeed the case. They also said that at the front, they witnessed close cooperation between the various units and the news reporters, like family members, so that various news could be quickly transmitted, which is commendable. The rapid and accurate front-line news released by the Central News Agency on this Northern Hunan victory has had extremely great consequences. Regarding all the atrocities of the Japanese side, they said that according to the Chinese side's statements, they successively inquired with many people in Jinjing, Fulinpu, Qingshan City, and other places, and the contents were completely consistent, which is sufficient to prove that they are all facts. Then, they talked about general issues. They said that the current wounded soldier problem has been reasonably resolved due to the establishment of wounded soldier reception centers everywhere in the front. The spirit of army-civilian cooperation seen along the way is also worthy of admiration, and the anti-Japanese sentiment of the army and civilians is higher the closer they get to the front, which can be said to be a guarantee of final victory. Also, when the foreign reporters met with Commander Chen in a certain place yesterday, they also talked to him about their impressions of the trip. Mr. Durdin of the New York Times said that the Northern Hunan victory is indeed a fact and not false. The soldiers at the front are also extremely confident. Mr. Situ of the Associated Press said that the morale of the officers and soldiers at the front is increasing day by day, and the final victory is not a problem. He also said that just from traveling from Chongqing to northern Hunan, the vastness of the Chinese land and the richness of its specialties were the first things he felt. (Note: Situ had just arrived in China not long ago.) Mr. Billard of the Havas News Agency said that this inspection of northern Hunan made him deeply feel the greatness of the Chinese people's recovery power. For example, Changsha after the robbery, when we first arrived, there were only 50,000 people, and when we came back, it had increased to 70,000. Also, like the houses destroyed by the Japanese army everywhere along the way, they were rebuilt in a few days. The greatness of this recovery power is extremely admirable. Commander Chen immediately replied that China is an agricultural country and the people's lives are simple, so it is easy to recover after destruction. Mr. Bi continued, "I still remember that the various places in France during the European War were also destroyed, but it took a long time after the war to recover. France is also an agricultural country, but its recovery power is far worse than China." Chen replied again, "The lives of the French people are more complicated, so the recovery is slower." Mr. Martin of the United Press said that he deeply believed in the Japanese army's atrocities in northern Hunan this time, because when he returned to Changsha, he received a definitive report, the contents of which he briefly mentioned to Commander Chen. It can be seen that this inspection by the foreign reporters has confirmed the victory won by the Chinese army in northern Hunan and the various atrocities of the Japanese army, and has also confirmed that the Japanese army's combat power and morale have greatly declined. The final victory is also very obvious. (Dispatch of the 25th)

Chongqing – The National Diplomacy Association sent a telegram to U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew today, stating, "Your Excellency's speech in Tokyo not only fully demonstrated the U.S.'s consistent peace policy and reiterated the principle of the Open Door, but also has the effect of prompting the Japanese people who are kept in the dark to wake up suddenly." At the same time, the association also sent a telegram to U.S. Secretary of State Hull, stating, "The Chinese people unanimously praised Ambassador Grew's speech, believing that the U.S. government's wise decision on the Far East and the spiritual assistance to the Chinese people are immeasurable."

### Foreign War Correspondents Return to Chongqing from Hunan

Chongqing – A group of foreign reporters who went to inspect the front lines in northern Hunan flew back here yesterday afternoon with "spoils of war." During their trip, the Chinese army presented them with command knives, flags, pistols, and other souvenirs abandoned by the retreating Japanese army. This trip did not actually reach the front lines, because after a few of them arrived at the Miluo River, they decided to return to Chongqing. When asked about the accuracy of the Chinese army's victory in Changsha, a reporter smiled and said, "Of course there are no Japanese troops there." The reporters all said that the Japanese army left behind a large amount of military supplies and military equipment, which shows that the Japanese army's retreat must have been very hasty. The reporters saw signs of fierce fighting in Yingtan. Other Japanese troops on the southeast bank of Dongting Lake landed there in an attempt to encircle the Chinese army defending Xinqiang River and the Miluo River. The reporter also said that the terrain in northern Hunan made it very difficult for invading troops, because the roads had been destroyed and the mountainous countryside was most suitable for ambush warfare. They were entertained by General Xue Yue, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army in Changsha, General Chen Cheng, and General Bai Chongxi. (Dispatch of the 26th by Reuters)

Editorial

### Examining Soviet Policy Through Recent Events

Today, let us focus our discussion on the Soviet Union, haphazardly presenting our recent observations.

Regarding the Soviet Union, there is a small matter, like a bone in my throat, which I must quickly spit out. I often see newspapers run by the Japanese claiming that the *Shen Bao* is an "anti-Japanese organization" and a "reddened newspaper," and therefore advocating for its suppression and prohibition. Taking advantage of this discussion of the Soviet Union, please allow me to say a word first. The label of "reddened," in the eyes of those advocating suppression and prohibition, is naturally seen as a crime. We, however, believe that whether being considered "reddened" is praise or disparagement, honor or disgrace, it is inappropriate to apply it to the *Shen Bao*. To elaborate: If the Moscow of the past twenty years listed the *Shen Bao* among the ranks of "red" newspapers, we would not consider it praise or honor, but a mistaken compliment. If the German-Italian-Japanese bloc of two months ago placed the *Shen Bao* among the ranks of "reddened" newspapers, we would not consider it disparagement or disgrace, but a gross slander. Why? Because either praise or slander does not align with the facts. As for being "anti-Japanese," although it is not within the scope of this article's discussion, it does not hurt to say a word in connection: Disliking Japan may stem from traditional consciousness, narrow-minded emotions, or some kind of strategic need. Such categories may exist, but are certainly not the majority. The *Shen Bao* deeply believes that the vast majority of its readers, regardless of whether they are in or out of office, dislike Japan and thus become anti-Japanese because Japan has engaged in acts of aggression against China. If Japan one day proves through its actions that it has abandoned aggression, then the *Shen Bao* will certainly advocate not dwelling on past grievances and seek amity with Japan. If Japan continues its aggression, then we deeply believe that even those who admire Japan and hope for amity will eventually be unable to help! In short, in this unprecedented extraordinary period, we feel no interest whatsoever in debating ideologies or differences between factions. All alliances, enmities, grievances, and choices are measured solely by the interests and survival of the Chinese nation. We will use this standard in discussing the Soviet Union as well.

In previous discussions of the Soviet Union, we often said it was the most difficult mystery in the world to decipher. Therefore, what intentions it ultimately holds and what actions it will ultimately take cannot be foreseen or predicted until its intentions and actions are revealed to the world. From the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact to the present day, exactly two months have passed. The impressions the Soviet Union has given people in these two months are: abruptness, contradiction, fickleness, and coldness. The reactions it has elicited from people include those who swallow their anger, those who are pleasantly surprised, and those who don't know whether to laugh or cry. All of these past actions, except for the situation with Turkey, which outsiders have not been able to fully understand, are obvious in people's minds and do not need to be listed and elaborated upon. Those surrounding the Soviet Union are assessing its future actions, each according to its possible impact, and expressing their attitudes of prayer, cursing, enticement, and fear. Does the Soviet Union possess overwhelming power, which other countries find impossible to resist? Chamberlain and Hitler provided the opportunity, and Stalin and his successors were able to use it skillfully. Even now, we cannot definitively say what the Soviet Union's future actions will be. However, general observations suggest that while past Soviet actions were insufficient for understanding its entire intentions and actions, we can now gain insight into them through the outcome of the Soviet Union's negotiations with Finland. Indeed, the two main doubts that the Soviet Union is most widely viewed with are: First, will the Soviet Union ultimately conspire with Germany? Second, will the Soviet Union recklessly seek expansion without resorting to force? Its actions towards Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania involved expansion without the use of force. However, these situations involved a vast disparity in power, eliminating the need for force, and are insufficient to prove that it would not resort to force. Its actions towards Poland involved expansion with the use of force. However, this was due to seizing an opportunity conveniently, without requiring much effort, and is also insufficient to prove that it would not resort to force. Finland is not like the Baltic states. Internally, its national strength, and externally, its international position, are sufficient to warrant a war. If the Soviet Union recklessly seeks expansion, it will inevitably have to use force against Finland. Therefore, the outcome of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations should provide the world with a clear answer to the second doubt. We cannot definitively say what the answer will be. However, extrapolating from the various impressions the Soviet Union has recently given us: such as the reply to the US President's telegram, which, although irrelevant, was tolerant; such as the negotiations with Turkey, which, although not satisfactory, resulted in mutual expressions of harmony; such as the rumors in the Far East of Soviet aggression against China, which, although could have been ignored, were actively and earnestly denied; such as the Soviet ambassador to England immediately deciding to begin formal negotiations today after consulting with the British Foreign Secretary on trade issues between the two countries. All of these unconnected fragments can largely dispel all doubts.

We have always said that Soviet affairs are most difficult to decipher. However, while seeking answers to doubts, we still want to attempt further speculation. In the near future, the Soviet Union is unlikely to prioritize international "reddening." Looking at what it prioritizes, it prioritizes two points: first, it views Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania as satellites. Given Finland's undeniable national strength, it uses the demand that Finland not join an anti-Soviet group as a political condition; and the acquisition of several small Finnish islands close to Soviet ports, and the demilitarization of Finland on the Åland Islands, as its military conditions. What it took from Poland, internally, was to strengthen its political base through general elections; externally, it was to show goodwill to Britain, earning repeated statements from the British authorities that they "are not fighting for a particular country's borders." The "particular country" is of course Poland; the statement "not fighting for borders" probably means fighting for Poland's restoration, but not insisting on its original borders. There is no reason not to see this as an open tacit agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union. The right and wrong of Soviet expansion are open to debate, but the outline of its expansion in Europe has become largely discernible today. Striving to stabilize and enrich this outline is what it prioritizes. Second, the Soviet Union's commercial negotiations with Germany and Britain are proceeding simultaneously. We cannot hastily infer from the hostility between Britain and Germany that the Soviet Union's simultaneous negotiations with both sides are a manipulative tactic, sincere towards Germany but insincere towards Britain, or vice versa. The world generally appreciates that beyond the commercial negotiations, there is a symbolic political intention. In our view, it is better to think that the Soviet Union does not attach great importance to or is not constrained by the war between Britain and Germany. Therefore, it will not accept Germany's appeals and refuse trade with Britain, nor will it accept Britain's conditions and stop supplying Germany. In short, as far as trade is concerned, the Soviet Union only uses its own economic supply and needs as the criterion; the success or failure of negotiations only depends on whether a purely commercial calculation is beneficial to it; other than that, the Soviet Union hardly considers anything else. The Soviet Union is certainly not a capitalist country, but looking at its intentions, it seizes every opportunity and every possibility to leverage the resources of Britain, Germany, and any other country to seek its own becoming a strong and rapidly advancing capital unit. Is this not the Soviet Union's policy today? If our analysis is not mistaken, then its attitude in the Far East can also be seen from this. And the rumors of advancing troops into Xinjiang, or making political demands on China, which would lead to broad and serious international disputes, are certainly things the Soviet Union will not do. This can be stated definitively.

### Chamberlain Reports on Military Situation in the House of Commons, Refutes Ribbentrop's Speech

London - When the House of Commons convened this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately delivered a speech reporting on the military situation of the past week. He stated, in brief: "There have been no major battles on the Western Front. Our country continues to supply fresh troops and military supplies to the expeditionary forces currently at the French front. Regarding the naval aspect, none of our ships escorted by warships have been destroyed by the enemy, and our warships and aircraft have not suffered damage. German aircraft often attack our Scapa Flow naval base in Scotland and the Firth of Forth, and three have been shot down by our forces. In addition, our cargo ships have had five ships sunk by the enemy, totaling 22,715 tons. The work of searching for submarines has also been intensified. The number of enemy submarines destroyed by our forces is still considerable, enough to make us believe that the threat posed by enemy submarines can be easily eliminated. The point that enemy submarines should draw attention to is that their lawless behavior has already intensified. As for the international situation, the major event of the past week was the successful signing of the Mutual Assistance Pact between Britain, France, and Turkey. This pact is not only extremely satisfying to the British Empire and France, but it is also welcomed by countries around the world. This is something that we should recognize as a major encouragement. The reason why countries around the world have expressed their welcome is because the pact is, at the very least, a guarantee of peace in the Eastern Mediterranean. There is no doubt about that. This pact does not pose a threat to any country; it is purely a defensive tool, with its sole objective being to resist aggression. The governments of Britain, France, and Turkey will also hold talks to discuss the issue of British and French economic and financial assistance to Turkey, as well as military supply assistance. These talks are being conducted in a friendly and candid spirit, and a general agreement has been reached. We firmly believe that beneficial results have been obtained in practice. The German authorities recently convened a meeting of leaders of the National Socialist Party's local branches in Berlin. The speech that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop subsequently delivered in Danzig was likely the result of this meeting. However, judging by his speech, there are countless instances of distorted right and wrong. Although Ribbentrop wants to deceive fair-minded observers around the world, it is difficult for him to succeed because the counter-evidence is readily available. His main argument is nothing more than that it is Britain, not Germany, that has brewed and instigated the war. This statement is inconsistent with the facts and needs no further explanation. The whole world already knows it. The problem that historians should consider in the future is to what extent the tragedy that has recently occurred in Europe is due to Ribbentrop's ignorance of British policy and the British national character. Ribbentrop seems to want to invite the Soviet Union to join an anti-British crusade. We should now recall the speech he gave when he first took office as ambassador to Britain in 1936 to prove his self-contradiction. At that time, he declared: 'Our leader Hitler firmly believes that whether from the perspective of Europe or the British Empire, the only real crisis is the spread of communism. This is the most terrible crisis (the members of parliament laughed loudly), the reason why it is most terrible is simply because people always recognize it too late.' (The members of parliament laughed even louder. At that time, Soviet Ambassador Maisky was in the diplomatic corps' spectator seat and laughed loudly when he heard this.) Ribbentrop declared in Danzig yesterday that Germany wants to end this war with all its might. If Germany's decision is indeed so, then our only response is that we are also determined to fight to the end. However, one point must be stated: this war was not caused by Britain provoking Germany, but because the German government, regardless of the repeated warnings issued by our country, continued to engage in acts of aggression, finally forcing our country to respond. In other words, the responsibility for this war and all its consequences should be borne by Germany. This matter is, in fact, caused by Germany's disregard for promises and violation of the rights and freedoms of nations." (Havas dispatch, 26th)

### Eden Speaks on War Aims, Establishes International Trust, Dominion Cabinet Members to Arrive in England to Discuss Close Cooperation Methods

London - Dominion Secretary Eden delivered a broadcast speech this evening, stating, in brief: "Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa have all sent cabinet members who will gather in London in the coming weeks. The close cooperation between the Dominions and the Mother Country will be evident here again. We do not intend to hold any kind of formal meeting at that time, nor do we need to draft cumbersome agendas. Instead, we will exchange views in an informal manner and discuss methods of close cooperation. As for the current situation, the Dominions have already made great contributions to air force cooperation. This has a huge impact on the future of the war, and there is no need to elaborate. The Dominions are training air force personnel very quickly, and the results are excellent. These personnel receive preliminary training within the Dominions and then gather in Canada for further study. The training methods are very innovative. Our country's skilled pilots will therefore receive sufficient replenishment. As for this war, it was caused by the German government's betrayal of trust and Hitler's insistence on going his own way. We have been forced into this situation and have no choice but to deal with it. However, we are not fighting against one person or for a country's borders, but for the maintenance of trust between nations. If there is no trust between nations, there can be no peace. In short, all kinds of documents about the war have been made public, and the world will make its own judgments about right and wrong. After Britain and France win the war, the responsibilities they bear will be very heavy, but the opportunities will also be limitless. The men and women of all countries, although subjected to servitude, have not had their spirits exhausted. At that time, they will certainly be effectively leveraged to promote cooperation between European countries and establish understanding among countries around the world." (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### British Newspapers Scathingly Criticize German Foreign Minister

London - The *Times* today's editorial scathingly refutes German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's broadcast speech in Danzig on October 24, stating that Ribbentrop, since taking the position as ambassador to England, has already been deemed unqualified, and later made one mistake after another, causing Germany to be in the worst diplomatic position ever. This time his high-sounding words, the main theme is nervous depression, and the nervous depression is not good based on his "nervous warfare." Ribbentrop has consistently insisted to the Fuhrer that Britain will never take up arms to resist Germany, now he loudly exclaims, "The British government has been systematically preparing for war against Germany for many years." The *Times* enumerates the impact of Ribbentrop's policies in Japan, Spain, Italy, the Baltic, Central Europe, and Southeast Europe, saying that if this kind of person were not unfortunately still occupying an important international position, then what he said would be regarded as coming from a thief and not worth paying attention to. Only that his lies and distortions can be viewed as another clear demonstration of Ribbentrop's decline in European diplomacy, The *Times* in accordance with recently published documents, refuting Ribbentrop's remarks, said that there is no doubt that Ribbentrop would not even consider most of the public opinions in his own country, to make the sad remarks of encouraging his countrymen to resist Britain, it is directly admitting his own mistakes in predicting and declaring the bankruptcy of his own policies. The *Manchester Guardian* also published an editorial, stating that the French side can respond to the part of Ribbentrop's speech about France, but we must explain that France and Poland established a mutual assistance pact long before the current British government came to power, and this pact was subsequently continued twice by the French and Polish governments.

### Germany Actively Attacks Warships and Merchant Ships, British Navy Also Intensifies Blockade of Germany, Intercepts 338,000 Tons of Contraband, Soviet Union Protests British-Announced List of Contraband

London - According to reliable sources from authoritative sources today, since the outbreak of the war, the British government has detained 580 ships of various countries, including 24 American merchant ships, which have been detained for inspection for as long as 18 days. According to Minister of Economic Warfare Cross, in the House of Commons, in the first six weeks after the outbreak of the war, Britain intercepted 338,000 tons of contraband goods bound for Germany. In general, Germany's overseas supply has been completely cut off. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)

London - Minister of Economic Warfare Cross stated in the House of Commons this afternoon that the government authorities have exchanged views with the governments of various neutral countries on the issue of inspecting wartime contraband. The governments of Iceland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Belgium have now sent delegations to arrive here. We are also contacting the governments of other neutral countries through diplomatic channels, and good progress has been made. In short, Britain must carefully inspect the goods of various neutral countries, and the legitimate trade and needs of each country will certainly be taken into account. However, the rights of belligerent countries must also be fully exercised, and various contraband goods, all those suspected of assisting the enemy, will be detained. As for the general situation, the source of Germany's overseas supply has almost been cut off. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Belgium - The British Embassy in Belgium recently issued a press release stating that our country's economic blockade against Germany is necessary in the current war. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect the ships of various neutral countries, and various procedures must be simplified. However, because past inspections have not been thorough, some goods still arrived in Germany. In the future, it will be necessary to handle them strictly. In short, our country has no intention of hindering the supply of various neutral countries. If these countries can cooperate fully, then inspection procedures will be able to be completed quickly. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Moscow - The British government previously sent two notes to the Soviet government on September 6 and 11, 1939, notifying the types of wartime contraband. Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Potemkin recently sent a reply to British Ambassador Seeds, stating, "I acknowledge receipt of your government's two notes of September 6 and 11, 1939, and I am deeply aware of your intentions. The Foreign Affairs Committee, on behalf of the Soviet government, hereby responds as follows: The list of contraband announced in the British government's note of September 6 conflicts greatly with international law and the principles expressed in the international declaration on naval warfare of February 26, 1909, seriously damages the interests of neutral countries, and destroys international trade. The British government has included fuel, paper, cotton, livestock fodder, shoes, socks, clothing, and clothing materials, and even all food, such as bread, meat, butter, sugar, etc., in the list of contraband, which in fact amounts to declaring that all basic necessities of life are contraband, thereby creating the possibility of unlimited or arbitrary designation of any civilian goods as contraband. From now on, the supply of necessities for the life of the peaceful population will be thoroughly disrupted, so that the health and lives of the peaceful population will be seriously endangered, causing a great disaster among the vast population. According to the world's recognized principles of international law, the act of bombing peaceful people, women, children, the old and the weak by air should be prohibited. For the same reason, the Soviet government believes that depriving peaceful people of food, clothing, and fuel, and declaring such necessities as contraband, thereby causing women, children, the old and the weak to suffer pain, hunger, and cold, is also inappropriate. Therefore, the Soviet government hereby declares that it cannot agree with and consider effective the British government's note of September 6. The Soviet government also cannot agree with the points contained in the British government's note of September 11, namely, that the British government has unilaterally established a method of monitoring neutral merchant ships in several designated seaports. The Soviet government believes that requiring neutral merchant ships to go to the aforementioned ports, and attaching the threat of enforcement by force, is completely arbitrary and unreasonable. This method violates the basic principles of freedom of maritime trade and is also inconsistent with the International Declaration of February 26, 1909, and the ruling of the Hague Tribunal regarding the 'Carthage' incident in 1913. At the same time, the Soviet government declares that its own merchant ships are all inherent property, and even from this point of view, they should not be subjected to the same compulsory treatment as privately owned merchant ships. Based on the above reasons, the Soviet government reserves the right to demand compensation from the British government for all losses suffered by its agencies and citizens due to the aforementioned measures of the British government and the actions of the British authorities." (TASS dispatch, 26th)

Denmark - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a press release stating that it received a letter from the German Embassy stating that the country's navy will launch a relentless attack on the warships of Britain and France, as well as the merchant ships they escort. This action is not limited to warships, but also applies to escorted merchant ships, regardless of which country they belong to. Merchant ships of all countries that sail at night, if they do not comply with international navigation regulations and light a light, may be mistaken for enemy ships and risk being sunk. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

### Western Front Battle Report

Paris - The General Headquarters recently issued the 104th battle report, stating, "Heavy rain last night, the front line was peaceful." (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Paris - The General Headquarters recently issued the 103rd battle report, stating, "Both enemy and our reconnaissance units were quite active in various places on the front line today. An enemy troop came to attack along the Moselle River and has been repelled." (Havas dispatch, 25th)

London - French military commentators declared that the recent activities on the Western Front show that the German army is eager to retake the important high ground southwest of the Hautes-Hautes Forest, which is still in the hands of the French army. Since Sunday, the German army has attacked three times, but all have been repelled. French commentators all believe that the extended artillery bombardment that was commonly seen in the last war will be abandoned and replaced by concentrated fire. This artillery fire will be used to dazzle the defending troops, and then followed by attacks by various forces, with special efforts devoted to disrupting the rear of the defending troops in order to prevent their supply and reinforcements. This strategy was quite effective in Poland, but the situation at that time was very different from the Western Front. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)

Berlin - The German High Command issued a battle report this afternoon stating that the high ground 12 kilometers west of Völklingen, located near the German-French border, was occupied by the German army the day before yesterday. The French army launched a counterattack yesterday, and the artillery fire was extremely fierce, but there were no results. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 26th)

### Soviet Protest Reason: England Claims No Basis

London - Reuters reported today from responsible sources that the Soviet Union has protested against the British contraband list, but the grounds for its protest are completely unfounded. The 1909 international conference cited in the protest, which drafted the so-called London Declaration on Naval Warfare, was a fruitless meeting, and its declaration was never ratified by any country. It did not come into effect in the first week of the European War in 1914. According to today's international law, any belligerent government can freely declare any item as contraband. (Reuters telegram, 26th)

London - Regarding the British inspection of neutral ships, after the Soviet government lodged a protest with British Ambassador Sir Seeds yesterday, local officials have expressed dissatisfaction, stating that the British government's contraband list announced in a note earlier this year is identical to the blockade implemented by the Allied Powers, including Russia, during the last European War. It is difficult to understand why the Soviet Union is now opposing it. (Havas telegram, 26th)

Amsterdam - Although British authorities have assured the facilitation of ships carrying food for neutral countries, Dutch shipping companies still express dissatisfaction. Several Dutch ships were detained by British warships at Downs for as long as six weeks, and there are still as many as thirty Dutch ships waiting for inspection there. Dutch shipping companies are quite critical, and mentioned that the British personnel implementing contraband inspections are all military personnel, who have no knowledge of international shipping regulations. A Dutch delegation is currently in London discussing with British authorities, and a better solution can be obtained. (Associated Press telegram, 26th)

### Soviet Investigation of Detained American Ship's Cargo; Sailors Safe and Sound

Moscow - According to Moermansk sources, after the local maritime authorities determined that the cargo ship "City of Flint" entered the port for repairs, the detention of the German crew members has been lifted. The ship remains in port for a thorough investigation of the nature of the cargo. (TASS telegram, 26th)

Washington - The State Department has just received a telegram from Ambassador Steinhardt in the Soviet Union stating that he received a note from the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, stating that the American cargo ship "City of Flint" is currently in Moermansk, and all crew members are safe and sound on board. (Havas telegram, 26th)

Washington - Regarding the detention of the American cargo ship "City of Flint," Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to the press stating that according to a report from the American Embassy in Germany, German naval authorities and the Hamburg Prize Court have denied the news reports. The British Embassy is continuing its investigation. In addition, Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin told American Ambassador Steinhardt yesterday that he was unaware of the matter and would inquire with the naval authorities. Furthermore, according to a telegram from the American Legation in Norway, the "City of Flint" carried a total of ninety people, of whom seventeen were sailors sent by a German warship, and thirty-seven were survivors of the British ship "Stonegate," who have landed in Trondheim, Norway. In short, the United States government is determined to thoroughly investigate this matter in accordance with international law and American rights. (Havas telegram, 25th)

### Someone Plots to Sabotage Two Major British and French Liners

New York - The New York World Telegram recently reported that a suspicious person was arrested by the police in a subway station near the anchorages of the French liner "Normandie" and the British liner "Queen Mary." Explosives were found on his person. The person refused to state his nationality or reveal the reason for carrying the explosives. It is suspected that he intended to sabotage the British and French liners. (Havas telegram, 25th)

London - Officials recently announced that five British ships, totaling 22,700 tons, have been sunk by German submarines. Thirty-one crew members of the "Ledbury" have been rescued. The crew of the "Stonegate" have all been rescued. Thirty-one of the thirty-five crew members of the "Leifur" have reportedly been rescued, but their whereabouts are unknown. Only five crew members of the "Manningtree" have been rescued. Seventy-eight crew members of the "Cronsham" have been rescued, but the whereabouts of twenty others are unknown. (Havas telegram, 25th)

### Amendment to Limit Presidential Power Vetoed by US Senate; US Government Announces Figures for Arms Embargo

Washington - The Senate today continued to discuss the Neutrality Act proposed by Pittman. Republican Senator Johnson proposed an amendment stating that once the President or Congress recognizes that a state of war has occurred, the President should declare that a state of war exists. The purpose of this proposal was obviously to limit the President's power. Democratic Senator Pittman, Connelly, and Republican Senators Vandenberg and Norris spoke in opposition. The Senate ultimately rejected it by a vote of 61 to 26. Johnson then proposed another amendment, arguing that neither Congress nor the President has the power to recognize that a state of war exists, which was also rejected by a vote of 75 to 14. Progressive Senator La Follette proposed an amendment calling for the establishment of an export control committee to limit the quantity of various American goods shipped to belligerent countries, so that it would not exceed peacetime levels, which was also denied by a vote of 66 to 21. The meeting was then adjourned. (Havas, 25th)

Washington - During yesterday's Senate debate on amendments to the Neutrality Act, isolationist Senator La Follette proposed holding a referendum before declaring war. La Follette also said, "If the members of the House and Senate truly represent the will of their districts, they will consider this matter." The administration strongly opposes this. Secretary of State Hull and other administrative leaders stated that this move would weaken the nation's foreign policy and would not be helpful in avoiding war. (Associated Press telegram, 26th)

Washington - According to the State Department, since the invocation of the Neutrality Act on September 5, over US$75 million worth of licenses for arms exports to belligerent countries have been rejected. Of these, those procured for France were worth US$57.5 million, Britain US$15 million, Australia US$5 million, and Germany only US$50,000. The British dominions and colonies affected include Canada, South Africa, Burma, India, Southern Rhodesia, the Federated Malay States, Hong Kong, Palestine, New Zealand, and Kenya.

### Sinking of HMS Royal Oak Continues to be Discussed in British House of Commons

London - During the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, a member asked whether the government would issue another statement regarding the sinking of the battleship "Royal Oak" at a later date. First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill immediately replied, "Yes, but we must strive to be cautious so as not to reveal information that would benefit the enemy." A member also asked whether it was credible that the commander of the German submarine that sank the "Royal Oak" claimed that the submarine had been observing the vicinity for forty-eight hours before entering Scapa Flow. First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill replied, "I have read the statement made by the submarine commander. Part of it is what I announced in the House of Commons, and another part is completely inconsistent with the facts. In short, Scapa Flow is surrounded by islands and covers dozens of miles, and the warships anchored there are several miles apart." First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill also replied to a member's inquiry, stating that there are 5,000 naval trainees under the age of eighteen serving on various ships, of whom 137 have been killed in action. At this point, Labour MP Wedgwood asked whether battleships of the same class as the "Royal Oak" would be modernized to make them less vulnerable to torpedo attacks, and how much this project would cost. He also asked whether orders had been given to stop building aircraft carriers and giant battleships under construction in our country, which Germany does not have, in order to focus on building more needed warships. First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill replied in writing that battleships of the same class as the "Royal Oak" have all been modernized, at an average cost of £200,000 per ship. As for aircraft carriers and battleships, not only Germany but other naval powers are also building them. This is especially necessary for our country to control maritime communication lines. (Havas telegram, 25th)

Berlin - This afternoon, the German Naval Headquarters announced that at noon on the 21st of this month, a German patrol boat accidentally struck a mine and sank near the Danish island of Møn. Five of the fifty-five crew members were rescued. (Haitong, 26th)

### Soviet-Finnish Negotiations: Contents Kept Strictly Secret; Rumors of Four Soviet Demands; Finnish Representatives Return to their Country for Instructions

London - Regarding the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland, diplomatic sources here recently stated that the strict secrecy surrounding diplomatic negotiations has rarely been seen as much as in the current Soviet-Finnish negotiations. In Finland, only a few key cabinet members are aware of the contents. However, considering the various sources of information, there are still various reasons to be optimistic about the prospects of the negotiations and that they will not lead to war. This is because Finland has the sympathy of the United States and the Scandinavian countries, and its national character is extremely strong, and its military strength cannot be underestimated. The Soviet Union may not dare to risk attacking it. As for the demands made by the Soviet Union, it is rumored that the following items are included:

*   The small islands in the Gulf of Finland, near the Soviet ports of Leningrad and Kronstadt, which have always belonged to Finland, should be ceded to the Soviet Union.
*   A strip of land bordering the Soviet Union in the Finnish Karelian region should be ceded to the Soviet Union.
*   Regarding the Åland Islands, Finland should provide guarantees that it will not build defensive fortifications on the islands.
*   Finland should provide guarantees that it will not participate in political groups opposed to the Soviet Union.

If the above points can be complied with, the Soviet Union can cede certain territorial interests in the Arctic coast peninsula and the Polozhavia region (where the Finnish population is a large majority) to Finland as compensation. (Havas telegram, 25th)

Helsinki, Finland - A rumor that the Finnish government intends to borrow money from the United States has recently been denied by a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Havas telegram, 25th)

Helsinki, Finland - The delegation led by Paasikivi returned here from Moscow this morning. Once new instructions are received, it is said that they will return to Moscow to continue the talks. (Havas telegram, 26th)

Helsinki, Finland - Finnish Chief Delegate Paasikivi and Finance Minister Tanner returned here this morning. After disembarking, they immediately went to meet with Prime Minister Cajander and Foreign Minister Erkko to hold talks. The general view is that the issues between the Soviet Union and Finland can still be resolved through negotiations. Although there has been no development regarding Finland issuing bonds in the United States at this time, financial figures claim that now is an excellent time for Finland to issue bonds in the United States, given President Roosevelt and the American people's sympathy for Finland, and it may be slightly successful. (Haitong telegram, 26th)

Helsinki - Well-informed sources here believe that Finnish Envoy Paasikivi, who is in charge of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, will return to Moscow in about a week to continue negotiations with the Soviet government. The Finnish government believes that the new Soviet proposals are of a decisive nature, and Finland needs at least five days to consider them. (Haitong telegram, 26th)

Helsinki, Finland - Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko gave a statement to the press as the Finnish delegation left the Soviet Union to return home, elaborating on the government's attitude towards the Soviet-Finnish negotiations. It stated that the Finnish government does not intend to change its policy of strict neutrality on national affairs, nor does it intend to make concessions on vital interests in order to resolve the current crisis. It only hopes to resolve all issues through peaceful means, based on the principle of strict neutrality. (Haitong telegram, 26th)

### Soviet Union Conducts Business Negotiations; Maisky Visits Halifax

London - Soviet Ambassador to England Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon to discuss trade issues between the two countries. According to responsible sources, British-Soviet trade negotiations will be conducted by representatives of the Ministry of Commerce, Ambassador Maisky, and representatives of the Soviet Trade Delegation in England, starting tomorrow. The Ministry of Commerce will also hold a meeting tomorrow morning to determine the principles of the negotiations. Political figures say that this negotiation was considered as early as the middle of last month, and its significance is extremely important and contains political implications. The extent to which the Soviet Union can maintain an independent position from Germany economically can be seen from this. In addition, economic negotiations are also underway between Germany and the Soviet Union. What England and Germany need is clearly in opposition, and the Soviet Union's choice will be a symbol of its political intentions. (Havas telegram, 25th)

Berlin - Regarding Haitong's inquiry that Germany and the Soviet Union will conclude a trade agreement stipulating that the Soviet Union will transport one million tons of fodder to Germany, this has been confirmed by authoritative sources and will be implemented within two months.

Berlin - The Soviet trade delegation arrived here today. It is said that the negotiations held in Moscow between Germany and the Soviet Union discussed Germany's purchase of ores, kerosene, timber, cotton, phosphate, salt, flax, platinum, manganese, etc. from the Soviet Union, and an agreement has been reached. Negotiations are still underway in Moscow regarding the goods that the Soviet Union needs to purchase from Germany. It is expected that Germany will include industrial products in addition to selling machinery to the Soviet Union. The Soviet trade delegation came to Germany to investigate the production situation of German industry and chemical industry. (Haitong telegram, 26th)

### Strategic Naval Position of Ports in Estonia and Latvia

Riga, Latvia - Naval expert Captain Leiner-Kranf of the Baltic Sea, when interviewed by Mr. Hohenberg, special envoy of Haitong News Agency, reviewed the strategic importance of the bases in the Baltic Sea that the Soviet Union had obtained after signing treaties with Estonia and Latvia. Captain Leiner-Kranf has held important naval positions and is friendly with the Russian Emperor and naval officers of the Imperial Russian era, so his remarks are valued by all parties. The reporter raised various questions, and Mr. Leiner-Kranf answered them in detail.

*   The situation of Russian defenses along the Baltic Sea coast during the last World War: Captain Leiner-Kranf said that when the last World War broke out, the defense locations were only Kronstadt, Sveaborg, Dünamünde, and Libau.
*   The problem of defending the Gulf of Finland: Captain Leiner-Kranf said that the defense of the Gulf was divided into three lines of defense. At that time, Mr. Leiner-Kranf was the commander of the second line of defense.
*   The problem of fortifying the Åland Islands: Mr. Leiner-Kranf said that the Russian Emperor at that time firmly believed that the situation of the Åland Islands would have to change sooner or later. In 1914, it came to fruition, and Russia fortified the Åland Islands. (Haitong telegram, 26th)

### Hitler Orders Establishment of Danzig District; Forster Appointed Governor

Danzig - German leader Hitler issued an order yesterday establishing the Danzig District, the same as other German districts, and appointed former Danzig Nazi leader Forster as the administrative governor of the district. The newly established Danzig District has 2.4 million people, 30,000 square kilometers of land, including Danzig in the former West Prussia Province, the former Polish Corridor, the former Marienwerder District, and Braunsberg and Riebnitz-Rybnik, which belonged to Russia before the war.

### Some of the Polish Military Equipment Seized by Germany Will Be Supplied to China; Soviet-German Agreement Reached

Paris - According to news here last night, the Soviet-German economic group has reached an agreement on how to deal with the Polish military equipment captured by Germany. Germany will supply China with tanks, anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, rifles, and military uniforms obtained from Poland. China will supply Germany with tungsten iron and other raw materials, which will be transported by Russian railways. (Associated Press telegram, 26th)

### Germans in Latvia Gradually Transported to Germany

Latvia - The German ship "Sachsen" transported the first batch of Germans from Latvia to Danzig two weeks ago. It is now scheduled to set sail from here this morning for the second transport. About 450 Germans will take the ship to Danzig. However, the German resettlement plan has not actually started yet, because about 60,000 Germans here must sign a German-Latvian agreement before they can leave the country. (Haitong telegram, 26th)

### Lithuanian Army Postpones Taking Over Vilnius; Conflicts Between Local Military and Civilians

Copenhagen, Denmark - According to news from Lithuania, conflicts suddenly broke out between Polish residents of Vilnius and the Soviet authorities. The Lithuanian army was originally scheduled to take over the city today, but had to postpone it. (Havas telegram, 25th)

### Four Near Eastern Countries Exchange Views

Paris - Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan, which concluded a non-aggression pact in 1937, are now said to be holding a meeting in Baghdad or Ankara soon. Informed circles here have paid close attention to it. These four countries have now begun to exchange views. It is speculated that this meeting is related to the establishment of a mutual assistance treaty between England, France, and Turkey. It is likely that these four countries will also review the impact of Soviet-Turkish negotiations on the situation in the Middle East at the meeting. Since this non-aggression pact of the four countries contains a very accurate definition of aggression, this pact can become the basis for a four-country group similar to the Balkan Group. (Reuters telegram, 26th)

### Japanese and Soviet Ships Mutually Detained are Exchanged and Returned

Tokyo - The Japanese and Soviet authorities are conducting various negotiations to resolve various pending issues. As a result of several agreements on the issue of ships previously detained by the two countries, it was decided to exchange and return them to each other in succession. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an outline on the 22nd as follows: Regarding the detention of Japanese ships by the Soviet Union, since the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have negotiated several times, the crew of the Tsuruga Maru and four fishing boats, 48 people, were released on March 2 this year, and the crew of the Asahou Maru, Kyouei Maru, and Take Maru were also handed over on September 20. Regarding the issue of the ships themselves, a general solution was reached by September, and the Soviet side began to return the Japanese Chokichi Maru, Kyoei Maru (October 20), Fukui Maru (30), Tsuruga Maru, Hisanaga Maru, and Asahi Maru from September 20. As for other ships, they will be handed over after repairs. Furthermore, the issue of the release of the Hakuyo Maru is currently under negotiation. It is expected that part of the stranded ship will be handed over soon, and the remaining part is also scheduled to be handed over to the other party soon. (Domei News Agency telegram, 26th)

### British Board of Trade Prohibits Import of Silver

London - The Board of Trade today ordered a ban on the import of silver bullion and foreign silver coins into the UK, except for those with licenses. (Reuters telegram, 25th)

London - The Ministry of Trade announced yesterday that the order banning the import of silver was issued to protect the British pound, but countries such as Japan will be greatly affected. In the eight months of 1939, Japan was the country with the most imports. American bankers will also be affected. They have been taking advantage of the drastic changes in the London exchange rate to ship silver to England and profit from it. The market here is not surprised by this order, but whether the silver market will become sluggish as a result will depend on whether parties can obtain special permits. Currently, the impact is that prices will increase due to increased demand. (Associated Press telegram, 26th)

### British Attitude Towards China Remains Unchanged

London - Regarding the Japanese rumor that British Foreign Secretary Halifax had told Chinese Ambassador to England Guo Taiqi at the outbreak of the European War that Britain could no longer assist President Chiang Kai-shek, according to reliable sources here, this statement is inaccurate. In fact, the British attitude towards China has not changed. (Reuters telegram, 26th)

### Churchill Responds to Questions in the House of Commons: Withdrawal of Gunboats from Yangtze River Actually Serves Another Purpose

London - During the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, Labour MP Adams asked First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill whether the withdrawal of five British gunboats stationed in China from the Yangtze River was due to Japan's claim that Western countries should withdraw from the Far East, or whether there was another reason. What would be the use of these gunboats afterwards? Churchill immediately gave a written reply, stating that the reason for the withdrawal of the gunboats from the Yangtze River was that they were more useful in other parts of China. How they would be deployed afterwards could not be disclosed in order to avoid compromising public interests. Conservative MP Morgan then asked whether the British government had made suggestions to Japan for mutual concessions in order to promote friendship. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied that although the British government had not made specific suggestions to Japan on this point, it had always wished to promote friendship with that country.

### Military Commission Releases Weekly War Situation: October 18th to 24th

Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Commission stated that since this week (October 18th to 24th), there have been no large-scale battles on the northern and southern fronts. The Japanese army has been repeatedly defeated on various fronts and is gradually approaching a state of exhaustion. Although they continue to struggle to reverse the decline, they have not succeeded under the strong attacks of the Chinese forces. The more important aspects of the combat are described as follows:

Guangdong Front: The Chinese army in the West River area has been fiercely attacking Jiangmen, Xinhui, and Sanshui since last week. The Japanese forces stubbornly resisted, and the fighting was extremely fierce. On the 16th, they broke into Jiangmen. The puppet army led by He Ping took the opportunity to revolt. On the 17th, they continued to capture Duchuan, eliminating the obstacle to the transportation of the three rivers. On the 18th, they broke into Jiangmen again, and on the 19th, they broke into Xinhui, burning down the Japanese military headquarters, barracks, warehouses, and other facilities. The Chinese army advancing towards Sanshui has crossed the Greater and Lesser Meishan Mountains and Longshe School and is advancing with combined forces. Another unit, with the cooperation of infantry and artillery, recovered Da Chigang and pursued to the city walls. The Japanese were extremely panicked. The Chinese army on the periphery of Guangzhou, with swift action, first destroyed the key Japanese transportation points, the Jiangcun Railway Bridge and the He Bridge in Huaxian County, and then launched a fierce attack on various fronts. They repeatedly captured Xiling in the county, Shitan, Baimawei, and Longyanliao near Shilong, and various strongholds in Wanqingsha, Xianwan County. They broke into Jiangyu, Guotang, and Zhizhushan on the Yuehan Road, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. As for the southern route, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Qixianshan and the east of Qixian in multiple routes for several days, repeatedly capturing Wenling City and Dalu City, two strongholds, and once broke into Qixian County, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese in Chaoshan, due to their weak forces, were frequently intercepted. They deployed over a thousand soldiers as reinforcements. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation and launched attacks for several days. One route is now approaching Chaozhou City, and the other route is surrounding Chenghai, currently engaged in fierce fighting.

Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi Fronts: On the border of Hubei and Jiangxi, Chinese and Japanese forces have continued to engage in battles for days. The Japanese forces besieged in Tongcheng, Hubei, are still tightly surrounded by the Chinese forces. The two strongholds of Xishan in the southeast of the city and Dasha Ping in the north of the city have been successively captured by the Chinese army, and the Japanese forces in the city are already showing signs of wavering. At the same time, the Chinese army in Tongshan thoroughly eliminated the Japanese forces in Baoshi River and Hengshi Tan, and these areas were also reported to have been recovered. Another unit of the Chinese army, in continuous attacks, quickly captured Yanglinshan and Chanbotan, two key outer positions of Bailuoji, and once stormed into the Japanese阵, killing countless enemies. The Chinese army on the north bank of the Xinqiang River in northern Hunan continued to attack for several days. One route captured Taolin and pressed the attack on Linxiang. The other route captured Zhongfang, Xitang, and Yanjia Dashan, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese resisting in Yueyang. They once stormed into Changanyi Station. The battle situation has now reached a stalemate. In the southwest of Nanchang, northern Jiangxi, more than a thousand Japanese infantry and artillery troops launched a fierce attack on Xiangfu Guan on the morning of the 20th. After being ambushed from both sides, hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed, and the remaining Japanese troops retreated in defeat towards Dacheng. The Chinese army advancing towards Fengxin and Jing'an repeatedly captured Maxingshan and Baimaogang on the outskirts of Fengxin City, as well as Leigongjian and Wanjiana on the outskirts of Jing'an City. They have launched city sieges for days, and the Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. After Wuningxi Shangdu was captured by the Chinese army last week, they took advantage of the victory and continued to advance, successively capturing Gutai, Putian Bridge, and Chaping Ao in various places. They approached the county seat and besieged it for several days. The Japanese forces are wavering and show signs of collapse. (To be continued)

### The Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu and the Northwest Lines are Both Counterattacking. The Japanese Army Has No Way to Open the Canal Transportation Line. The Chinese Army Has Entered Baoying City, Approaching Huai'an.

Taixian Correspondence: Since the Japanese army in northern Jiangsu launched a large-scale offensive on the first day of this month, attempting to open the canal transportation line, the Chinese army has fought bloody battles, giving them extremely serious blows. The Japanese army only obtained one or two empty cities. Up to now, the important towns along the canal line, such as Pingqiao, Huangpu, Sishui, and Jieshou, are still being guarded by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in the Gaobao area is heavily surrounded by the Chinese army and is already on the verge of collapse. The reason why they continue to advance east of the canal line is only to contain the Chinese forces. At the moment, the Chinese military authorities, in addition to actively launching military counterattacks, are also intensifying passive defense works. All the important river crossings east of the canal line are being sealed off. The Chinese military officer in charge, ×××, personally went to the front line. In addition to instructing the commanders of the anti-Japanese troops on combat strategy, he also inspected the blockade lines to enhance the strength of the defense works.

Fierce Fighting in Baoying on the Western Front

On the western front, the Chinese army counterattacking Baoying troops began to become active on the evening of the 16th after the newly arrived Chinese army ××× and ××× two regiments of reinforcements. A certain senior commander personally went to the front line to supervise the army, dividing the troops into three routes and advancing simultaneously. Around 11 o'clock at night, they arrived at the suburbs of Baoying, taking advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness and approaching the county town. After the Japanese army discovered it, they fired machine guns and cannons wildly at the four suburbs. The Chinese army also returned fire with machine guns, and a fierce battle ensued all night. At dawn on the 17th, the Chinese army selected a large number of daredevils, divided them and launched a fierce charge from the northeast two gates. Not fearing the Japanese army's rain of artillery fire, they advanced wave upon wave, breaking into the northeast two gates of Baoying. The Japanese army retreated and gathered in the southwest corner of the county town. The Chinese army, like a tide, rushed into the city in one fell swoop and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army, bayonet fighting, with blood and flesh flying everywhere. The Japanese army, holding about three hundred men in the city, had already been mostly killed or wounded by the Chinese army. Around 9 a.m., the southern route army of the Chinese forces also crossed the Minji River from Wangzhigang and tightly surrounded the southwest area of Baoying. A part of the heroic soldiers also broke in from the south gate and joined forces with the northern route Chinese army in the city. The remaining Japanese army held on to the houses in the southwest of the city, struggling desperately, waiting for reinforcements. The Chinese army surrounded the county town in two layers. As of the afternoon, they were still carrying out annihilation operations in fierce fighting. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than a hundred casualties, and the Chinese side also had heroic sacrifices.

Huai'an Besieged on the Northern Front

On the northern front, at dawn on the 17th, because a large number of strategic forces arrived and were briefly equipped, they immediately launched an attack on Huai'an County. The Japanese troops entrenched in various strongholds were defeated by the Chinese army. By night, they had taken advantage of the victory and advanced to various important strongholds in the suburbs of Huai'an, taking a siege posture against the city. It is said that the number of Japanese troops in Huai'an County was not very large, and there was no support that could be increased in various places. Now they have forcibly conscripted strong men to assist in the defense. It is expected that the Chinese army will get good results with a little deployment and attack.

### The Chinese Army Attacked Hangzhou in the Four Suburbs of Hangzhou, and Street Fighting Occurred. Five Large Fires in the Bustling Urban Area. Tongxiang County Was Also Attacked.

Hangzhou Correspondence: On the afternoon of the 20th, the Chinese army in the four suburbs of Hangzhou attacked Hangzhou City, rushed into Wulinmen, and a commando team risked climbing the Zhendong Tower, capturing the Japanese soldiers guarding the city alive. Later, the Japanese military headquarters in the city dispatched six or seventy more guarding soldiers, but they were still killed by the Chinese army attacking the city. After rushing into the city, they set fires immediately. Five places in Zhongqing Street, Pishi Lane, Qingtai Road, Dong Street, and Xuantan Alley in Hangzhou City caught fire. It is said that the factories and foreign firms opened by the Japanese were destroyed, including the Huasheng Tobacco Company, the distribution office of Sanyou Industrial Society (operated by the current Abe Yoko), Daimaru Yoko (on Baoyoufang Street), the Hangzhou Paper Factory, and the Japanese military barracks and the puppet pacification department clothing factory, which were almost affected by the fire. Therefore, the Japanese army was extremely panicked. It is expected that the Chinese army's general counterattack on Hangzhou is imminent. The four villages of Tongxiang have long been controlled by the Chinese army. The two forwards encountered the Japanese army in Lutou North and a battle broke out immediately. The Japanese army could not support it and collapsed one after another. The Morita unit of the Japanese army originally in Shimenwan was also resolved by the Chinese army. There was also a separate detachment of the Chinese army and the puppet pacification team engaged in fierce battles in the suburbs of Tongxiang. The Koizumi and Kumagai units of the Japanese army in the city also dispatched teams to reinforce. While the fighting was in full swing, the main force of the Chinese army arrived and took the opportunity to pounce on the county town.

Wangdian is the center of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, and its situation is critical. The number of Japanese troops entrenched in it is very small, and the guard troops along the railway are mostly replaced by the puppet pacification troops of Xu Pucheng's department. Recently, the Chinese army once captured Wangdian, and the momentum was very strong. They have been searching for traitors and executed many of them. The day before yesterday, two traitors who purchased steel auxiliary coins for the Japanese were also beheaded and shown to the public.

### Imported Goods Between Lanzhou and Pingliang are Extremely Expensive. The Price of Cigarettes is Appalling.

Yesterday, the reporter received a letter from a relative in Pingliang, transferred from Lanzhou, stating that he received a letter from his family, saying that rice prices in Shanghai have soared and everything is expensive, presumably due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange. The market price of imported goods in the Northwest is also rising. In Lanzhou, Great Britain brand cigarettes cost between two yuan and eight jiao and three yuan per can, Cannon cigarettes cost more than six yuan, Great Front Gate cigarettes cost more than four yuan, and Cigarette cost thirty-two yuan, which is appalling. The cost of living in Pingliang is lower than in Lanzhou, but it is not inferior to Shanghai. The roads are uneven and there are no street lights. Walking at night requires a hand-held lamp. Each candle costs more than two jiao. People from Shanghai who are accustomed to the material civilization are unaware of how difficult the daily lives of the people in the Northwest are.

### The crux of the problem and the improvement methods of childcare for refugee children (4) Qian Yonghe

Lack of teachers. Although the education and upbringing of children is a new education cause in the Anti-Japanese War, in the beginning, due to the urgency of rescuing refugee children, there was no time to strictly select teachers, or to collect personnel nearby to assist, or to volunteer enthusiastically and be willing to fulfill their obligations. Therefore, the teachers in the academies are very uneven. Some graduated from practical academies, some graduated from high school, some were students in colleges or universities, and some had worked in tax bureaus and county offices. There are very few who have graduated from the education department of a university, a normal school, or a high school normal school and have experience serving in elementary schools. The personnel dispatched by the teachers' service corps are qualified and have a lot of experience, but they still lack the spirit of service for nurturing. Therefore, the untidy clothing of children, the uncleanness of residences, and the easy spread of diseases are mostly due to the lack of experience and sense of responsibility of teachers and staff. According to the orphanages, child care homes, or orphanages established by various refugee relief organizations and institutions, there are more than 70 academies. Each academy has an average of six levels, and each level needs two teachers. Each academy has one director, one director of affairs and education, and three or four other staff members, for a total of more than 1,330 people. It is not difficult to find qualified teachers and staff for these 1,330 people, but there is a shortage of people who have excellent academic performance, rich experience, can endure hardship and hard work, are smart and capable, can care for children, and treat them like their own.

Management of supplies. The children in each academy are all living in the academy, and the management of all living supplies is enough to show the quality of the results. No matter a book or a pen, the name or student number is marked on the item, especially the sewing of clothes and the purchase of shoes and socks. The size should be measured and fitted. When replacing, wash, dry, brush, or mend them, and store them in an orderly manner and try to make use of them, such as combining two old and broken mats into one, or changing old clothes and pants from large to small, or using old socks to make mops. If teachers and staff can cherish children's supplies as if they cherish their own belongings, and train children to cherish them as well, they are not afraid of trivial matters in the management of supplies. If they handle them in an orderly manner, they can save a lot of expenses. However, now, each academy is mostly limited by funds. When textbooks are issued, there are no notebooks. When pencils are prepared, there are no brushes. In winter, there is only one set of shirts and pants and cotton-padded jackets and pants. After putting them on, there is no replacement, and there are no gowns and pants. As a result, they are covered in lice and the cotton-padded pants are filthy and cannot be worn again in the second winter. The original intention was to save expenses, but it has become an uneconomical fact. Other paper, ink, paper, inkstones, towels, and toothbrushes all require experienced people to manage and distribute them in order to be orderly and truly save money. It all depends on the close cooperation of class teachers and clerks and child care workers, but many academies are located in remote rural areas, and it is not easy to purchase large quantities of goods. If they have this, they don't have that, or there is no storage room. Before the goods are distributed, they are lost, or the teachers and staff lack management experience, and the children often wear large shoes and large coats. The distribution is improper, and the whole academy shows a state of chaos and disorganization. The management of supplies is the most important thing in a place that combines education and upbringing.

The above-mentioned knot of refugee children's relief and upbringing, if it cannot be improved to a climax, in the future, although the government and refugee relief organizations will spend huge sums of money, it will still be difficult to show excellent results with hard work. The methods of improvement are briefly described below, focusing on a few important points.

Strengthen Rescue Effectiveness. During the first phase of the Anti-Japanese War, the refugee children near each war zone were rescued by members of various refugee relief organizations, and the special commissioners of each relief zone of the Relief Committee, and the general and branch stations of refugees in various places, assisted in receiving, transporting, and providing supplies. But in fact, due to traffic difficulties and lack of means of transportation, each refugee relief organization felt unable to transport to the rear after rescuing refugee children. The nursery association has transportation stations, and often hundreds to thousands of children are waiting for ships and cars at the transportation stations. Other organizations rescuing refugee children can only transport them to nearby orphanages or orphanages.

In order to increase the transportation of rescued refugee children, when members of each refugee relief organization are sent to designated locations to rescue refugee children, they should first contact the political workers of the political department, local governments, highway bureaus, shipping companies, refugee stations, hospitals, and clinics. Please ask the political workers to assist in persuading the people in the war zone to send children who are unable to raise and educate to the relief organizations for transportation to the rear for education. The local governments and refugee stations should take care of food and lodging and safety along the way. Highway bureaus, shipping companies, and other organizations should provide transportation. Hospitals and clinics should send doctors and nurses to diagnose and treat sick children. Cooperate in many ways so that refugee children can be transported to the rear for education as much as possible.

### Finance Foreign Exchange Sales Exceed Purchases, Japanese Merchants Secretly Dumping, Hongkong & Shanghai Bank Sassoon's Buying Unsustainable

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the Hongkong & Shanghai Bank's listed rates. The over-the-counter market for British and American currencies saw mixed fortunes, with the trend shifting from tight to loose. As Chinese merchants took the opportunity to trade, they were quite willing to sell. It was also rumored that speculators, known for their keen sense, who had previously taken large long positions at tight prices of 4 7/8 pence, were now eager to exit the market. This was due to the European situation, where Germany's attitude suddenly turned tough, vowing to resist to the end, making peace seem unlikely. Furthermore, the Chinese war situation was improving, and with the United States recently making every effort to aid China, the international situation became increasingly favorable. The prospects for the national currency became more stable. The morning saw the British and American exchange rates retracing to 7.5, leading to reports of a slightly tighter British currency and a firmer American currency. Subsequently, as Sassoon continued to buy, the British currency briefly tightened, reaching 4 7/8 pence, and the American exchange rate also contracted to 7.9375 yuan. However, as Japanese merchants secretly dumped their holdings and Sassoon no longer had the appetite to buy, and with Hong Kong dealers and Chinese merchants aggressively selling, the market price immediately turned from flat to soft. In addition, American banks like Chase and some other banks also intended to sell, further loosening the situation. By noon, the British currency had fallen to 4 9375 pence, and the American exchange rate had exceeded the 8 yuan mark, reaching 8.25 yuan. The afternoon saw an even more pronounced loosening trend, with more sales than purchases. The Hongkong & Shanghai Bank bought some British currency at 5 pence, and the American exchange rate was briefly seen at a loose price of 8.375 yuan. After hovering for half a day, the British currency closed at 4.96875 pence, easing 0.01875 from the previous day, while the American exchange rate was 8.3125 yuan, firming 0.03125 from the day before yesterday. There were still forward transactions, with a trend similar to the spot market. Overall, trading was brisk throughout the day.

American Exchange Rate Re-emerges Above 8 Yuan

Early this morning, the recent London big bill retraced 0.05625, the forward rate fell 0.01875, the New York silver price fell 0.025, the London gold price remained unchanged, and the exchange rates between British, American, and French currencies were flat. The rate against Shanghai contracted 0.0125, the American rate against the British rate fell 0.0075, the rate against Shanghai fell 0.45 yuan, and the rate against the French rate fell 0.0125. The Central Bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were 4.78125 pence for the British currency and 7.96875 yuan for the American exchange rate, which were flat for the British currency and firmer by 0.03125 for the American currency compared to the previous close, due to the retracement of exchange rates. After opening, the situation seemed slightly softer as Western merchant Sassoon continued to sell slightly. Sassoon bought spot British currency from a certain bank at 4.75 pence, while the American exchange rate was also quoted at 7.9375 yuan by the bank. The Hongkong & Shanghai Bank's listed rates remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was announced to be slightly lower by 0.0375. Subsequently, Sassoon ceased buying, and someone unexpectedly took over the selling position of a certain party. Furthermore, American banks like Chase and a certain other bank also intended to sell, causing the British currency to immediately rebound to 4.8125 pence, and the American exchange rate also rebounded to 8.0625 yuan. Subsequently, Hong Kong Telecom also followed suit and sold, and Chinese merchants also came to dump their holdings, so the underlying trend became increasingly weaker, with the British currency reaching 4.9375 pence and the American exchange rate reaching 8.25 yuan. The situation stabilized slightly at noon. In the afternoon, the banks' spot selling prices were 4.90625 pence for the British currency and 8.1875 yuan for the American exchange rate, which were lower by 0.0125 for the British currency and firmer by 0.021875 for the American currency compared to the morning opening.

British Currency Briefly Reached 5 Pence

In the after-market, the situation turned firmer again as Hong Kong dealers continued to sell and speculators came to close their positions. At its firmest, the Hongkong & Shanghai Bank absorbed spot British currency from Hong Kong Telecom and speculators at 5 pence. At the same time, the American spot exchange rate was also bought by a certain party from speculators at 8.25 to 8.375 yuan. At the evening close, the banks' spot selling prices were 4.96875 pence for the British currency and 8.3125 yuan for the American exchange rate. The rates for this month were the same as the spot rates. The November rates were 4.921875 pence for the British currency and 8.21875 yuan for the American exchange rate. As a result, the British currency was firmer by 0.01875 and the American currency was firmer by 0.03125 compared to the previous day's current rates.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Continues to Decline

Hong Kong, 26th - This morning, the exchange market opened steadily. The British and Japanese exchange rates remained unchanged, while the American spot exchange rate tightened by 0.0625 to 25.0625 yuan. The forward rate was not quoted. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 1 yuan to 303 yuan (yesterday's close was 304 yuan). At 10:35 AM, the Shanghai exchange rate rebounded by 5 yuan to 308 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the market was calm with no gains or losses. The afternoon close saw the Shanghai spot exchange rate fall by 6 yuan to 302 yuan. At 2:30 PM, the market opened flat, and the Shanghai spot exchange rate continued to fall by 6 yuan to 296 yuan.

Tianjin British and American Exchange Rates Retract

Tianjin, 26th - Today, the exchange market opened flat in the morning. The British spot exchange rate tightened by 0.0125 to 4.75 pence, and the American spot exchange rate also contracted by 0.025 to 7.875 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 3.5 yuan to 103.5 yuan. The "Joint Currency" over-the-counter rate rose sharply by 5.5 yuan to 93.5 yuan.

### Gold Market Weak and Unable to Recover, Hong Kong Dealers' Aggressive Buying Slightly Reverses the Downtrend

Yesterday's cash gold dark market conditions were barely satisfactory, with a result of only a 42 yuan drop. The reason was frequent easing in foreign exchange. Drops of 50 yuan and 100 yuan were also expected. The fact that it closed so firm shows that the ups and downs of the gold market have become irregular. The opening was still flat, down slightly by 2 yuan from the previous day, at 3,820 yuan. Then, with the foreign exchange market slightly softer, it rose to 3,840 yuan. Suddenly, as exchange rates firmed, gold shops and securities firms sold off heavily, and the market suddenly declined, reaching 3,745 yuan by noon. As the afternoon session opened, sales continued, and although guest dealers continued to buy, they felt that the trend was difficult to reverse, with the smallest price being 3,735 yuan. Unexpectedly, a rumor spread, and the final rebound was unusually strong. Hong Kong dealers came to the market to buy, in large quantities. Although there was no shortage of people supplying, it was eventually raised to 3,745 yuan. However, it eventually closed at 3,780 yuan, with brisk trading of around 3,000 taels. Silver jewelry shops quoted 5 yuan less, and customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Cash Gold Falls 42 Yuan

From the morning, each tael (10 taels) - the initial opening was peaceful. At first, Qian Dui Ye (money exchange shops) bought 20 taels from gold shops, at 3,820 yuan, which was 2 yuan less than the previous close. There were few rumors that foreign exchange was soft, and Hong Kong dealers also began to buy. In an instant, it was raised by 20 yuan. A certain silver shop bought 50 taels from Qian Dui Ye, at 3,840 yuan. At this time, morale was still enthusiastic. Unexpectedly, foreign exchange suddenly eased, and Hong Kong dealers had enough appetite to eat it up. In addition, securities firms came out to heavily suppress the market. Before long, the market fell 43 yuan. The securities firm sold 30 taels to Qian Dui Ye, at 3,797 yuan. At that time, Qian Dui Ye had a little appetite, and Hong Kong dealers also absorbed more than 100 taels. The situation stabilized slightly, and it once rebounded to 3,815 yuan. After that, a certain gold shop suddenly came to sell, and foreign exchange became increasingly hard. Retail investors also supplied more than they demanded. For a time, there was a lack of support, and it suddenly plummeted 65 yuan. Qian Dui Ye sold 30 taels to the gold shop, at 3,750 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop profited and made up for it, pulling up 20 yuan, buying 50 taels from Qian Dui Ye at a price of 3,770 yuan. At noon, the selling spree was rekindled because foreign exchange continued to harden. Securities firms came out to dump again, and it fell again by 25 yuan, selling 30 taels to the gold shop, at 3,745 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opening was calm. The gold shop bought 30 taels from Qian Dui Ye, still at 3,745 yuan. Subsequently, Hong Kong dealers continued to buy, pulling up 15 yuan. A certain silver shop bought 20 taels from Qian Dui Ye, at 3,760 yuan. After that, Hong Kong dealers temporarily took a wait-and-see approach, and foreign exchange trends eased again, causing a selling spree from securities firms, etc., falling 15 yuan. They sold 30 taels to silver shops, priced at 3,715 yuan. After entering the market, Hong Kong dealers' buying interest became stronger, so they entrusted a certain gold shop, a certain silver shop, and a certain Qian Dui Ye to buy aggressively. Although Qian Dui Ye and silver shops heard that the British currency had reached 5 pence and came to sell, the head position was still insufficient, and it was raised by 50 yuan. A certain gold shop bought 20 taels from Qian Dui Ye at a price of 3,785 yuan. After Hong Kong dealers temporarily stopped buying, it immediately fell back down. Qian Dui Ye sold 10 taels to the securities firm, at a price of 3,760 yuan. Near the evening close, Hong Kong dealers unexpectedly showed their remaining power again, raising it by 20 yuan. A certain Qian Dui Ye bought 20 taels from a fellow dealer, at 3,780 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell 42 yuan compared to the previous day. It was heard that after the close, a certain Qian Dui Ye absorbed a total of 30 taels from silver shops and gold shops, priced at 3,785 yuan. The price fluctuated by 105 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold shops' own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than cash gold, and the buying price was 20 yuan less. The current bid price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price.

Jewelry is Quoted 5 Yuan Lower

The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael was still 385 yuan by large establishments. By noon at 12 o'clock, it was quoted 5 yuan lower. Since then, there have been no changes. Large establishments changed the quote to 380 yuan, and new establishments had the same price as the above price. The buying price must be reduced by 15 yuan to 20 yuan.

### Weak Foreign Currencies

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a decline in demand for British and American gold pounds due to the renewed easing of foreign exchange. The supply of British and American gold notes was relatively abundant, and the market was weak. The demand for Hong Kong notes was not high, and they trended slightly lower. French franc notes were in demand and were uniquely firm. Singapore and rupee notes weakened following the easing of exchange rates. The supply of Japanese gold notes increased, and the market was slightly soft, with the evening price being 1.1315 yuan. Korean notes were still scarce, and the market was slightly higher, with the evening price being 1.096 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds and British gold notes fell by 0.5 yuan, American gold pounds fell by 1 yuan, American gold notes fell by 0.2 yuan, Hong Kong notes fell by 0.02 yuan, French franc notes rose by 0.0002 yuan, Singapore notes fell by 0.1 yuan, rupee notes fell by 0.05 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities Minor Fluctuations in Domestic Debt

Yesterday's over-the-counter market for public bonds was quite stable, with the difference between buying and selling being no more than 0.2 or 0.3 yuan. The trend was low and then high, and morale was still very strong. However, the environment and news were dull, and most parties were waiting and watching, causing the range of rises and falls to gradually narrow, and there was also a hovering situation. There was no good news, and the future may be small. Yesterday, most of the transactions of the various groups were scattered. The 11th and 20th issues were mostly bought, and Tian Sheng and others always sold. Dafeng and Yongkang and other houses formed a situation of advancing first and then exiting, forming a stalemate. As a result, the ups and downs were extremely minor. Only Grade C was slightly better by 0.05, and Grades A and B were slightly smaller by 0.05. Grades B and E had no fluctuations at all. The total transaction volume was in the order of 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below:

Category  Highest  Lowest  Closing  Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 58.55 58.35 58.55 Down 0.05

Unified B 50.55 50.40 50.55 Down 0.05

Unified C 48.80 48.50 48.80 Up 0.05

Unified D 48.55 48.45 48.55 Flat

Unified E 48.90 48.75 48.90 Flat

In stock trading, 50 shares of stock were traded at the local exchange, priced at 28.75 yuan. The payment certificates issued by the local exchange are gradually increasing in demand, and the discount is gradually increasing.

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Association of All Trades saw a sudden shift in trend to lively activity in the afternoon as new accounts entered the market, and prices generally strengthened. However, the upward momentum of the species was not sustained, and although the market situation was still firm at the close, it had already fallen slightly. International Trust Company, Hong Feng, Rui Rong, China Reclamation Company, Steel Industry, and Jardine Spinning Mill stocks accounted for most of the total daily volume.

London, 25th - Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debts remained stable, with no changes in the upper and lower tiers of bonds.

London, 25th - Today's listed prices of British merchant Far East company stocks: bank stocks continued to rise, with Mercantile Bank shares rising 2 shillings 6 pence to £7.5, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation London-registered shares rising 0.5 pound to £76, and Hong Kong-registered shares rising 1 pound to £77. Chartered Bank shares also rose 2 shillings 6 pence to £10.15. Only Kuala Klang Rubber shares fell 3 pence to 16 shillings, while the rest remained unchanged.

### Cotton Yarn Scattered Transactions, Outlook Still Healthy

The yarn market continued to move forward. At the same time, although the demand from southern Hong Kong dealers for coarse yarn was subtle, scattered consumption was still healthy, so morale was tight. Recently, Ningbo in Zhejiang has seen some purchasing due to the departure of ships, so some have a more stable mentality and have come to take it back. In fact, it has fallen sharply for several days, so there is naturally a rebound and recovery. If the current sales can be followed closely, the foundation will be solid and can be expected to rise. Otherwise, it may still be in a state of revolving stagnation. Observing the current environment, the exchange rate is loose, and raw cotton is still firm. The two sides are still in conflict.

The opening price of spot goods in the morning continued the upward trend of the previous day, immediately rising by more than 10 yuan. At this time, speculators swarmed in an uproar. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse was 673 yuan. The selling spree suddenly rose and fell more than 10 yuan with no changes in foreign exchange, priced at 660 yuan. After a while, market rumors arose again, all in favor of the multi-party, and buying sentiment recovered. In an instant, it returned to between 673 and 678 yuan, and the closing was still stable. However, the yarn of other brands was still flat and weak. A total of 2,090 bales were traded in half a day. The market quotations were: 20-count Change Horse rose 21.5 yuan, Heavenly Girl rose 16 yuan, and Double Earth rose 19 yuan. The factory, Yong'an Factory, opened 300 bales of 20-count special Jin Cheng, priced at 675 yuan, and 300 bales of 10-count special Jin Cheng, priced at 510 yuan. Today, 160 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 475 Fellow Traders 1,410

Fuzhou 50 Ningbo 70

Jiangxi 20 Inland 65

Statistics 2,090

### Cotton Merchants Watching, Rural Market Prices Not Cheap, Transportation Profits Thin

Cotton transactions were slightly clearer, and transactions from all parties declined. Factories still had no activity. Although yarn prices have rebounded, the exchange rate has also eased, so manufacturers' thoughts are still indifferent. Although the source is continuous, the market price in the countryside is not cheap. In addition, road transportation fees and taxes are heavy, resulting in high costs. The profits of traders are so thin that market prices cannot fall. Yesterday, sales of Ignition and Tongzhou cotton rose by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan. 2,496 bales of Subai to Tong cotton arrived, and 330 bales were transported from Beisha. Today (27th), 300 bales were transported to Hong Kong, and 400 pieces of Ignition cotton were transported to Tianjin. The current cotton sales list (notes delivered to the warehouse) is listed on the left:

Tongzhou Cotton 130.00 Fellow Traders 200 Bales

Also 128.50 130.00 Fellow Traders 800 Bales

Ignition Flower 121.50 123.00 Fellow Traders 500 Bales

Another message: Yesterday morning, the exchange rate for Shanghai foreign cotton transactions was flat, and in the afternoon it tended to loosen. All fellow traders did not intend to take any action because the exchange rate could not be determined. Factories are planning to open a batch of cotton yarn these days, and may purchase raw cotton in the future. Yesterday's market transactions were very quiet.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: New York cotton market opened in a firm state in the early morning. It rose first due to the purchase of speculators and the good spot transaction, and then the market was very firm due to the high stock market and the purchase of overseas cotton merchants. As a result, the closing market price rose eight or nine pounds. The Indian cotton market was quiet, the Egyptian cotton market rose more than 20 pounds, and Liverpool rose 35 pence.

### Grains New Rice Arrives, Sales Prices Steady

The rice market has seen a settlement. Since it had fallen once before noon, it aroused the local patrons to take action yesterday. From morning to noon, the purchase intention was very strong. At the same time, there were more inland gangs absorbing the premium, and the situation reversed from fatigue to tightness. By noon, new goods from various districts arrived one after another, reaching more than 4,000 bags. People were inevitably affected. The sellers were more willing to sell. As a result, the sales were strong, and the supply and demand were matched. Therefore, the closing market was unchanged. The Changxi Special New Japonica rice still opened at 31 yuan, second to 27 yuan, broken japonica rice 30 yuan, second to 267 yuan, Sutongchangkun New Japonica rice special from 29 yuan, second to 26 yuan, broken japonica rice was in short supply, Qingjiao mixed species remained at 30 yuan and 5 cents, Wild rice was 31 yuan to 30 yuan and 5 cents, Fengjia Baige special goods were 29 yuan, second to 27 yuan, Songjiang Baige was 17 yuan to 26 yuan and 5 cents, slightly broken was 26 yuan, Nangang White rice was 19 yuan, Early broken was 25 yuan and 23 cents, Special Moujian was 23 yuan and a half, second to 21 yuan, Special Lujian was 24 yuan, second to 22 yuan and a half, Kejian Early Kai Wuhu and Nanjing special goods were still 19 yuan and 8 corners, and later the market was slightly raised by 2 or 3 corners to 20 yuan after being absorbed by the inland gangs, second to 18 yuan and a half, Jiangbei Jian was 19 yuan and 8 corners to 19 yuan and a half, Chen Yuan was 30 yuan to 28 or 9 yuan, and Xin Yuan was 26 yuan and a half to 25 yuan. The total transaction volume in the city was no less than 10,000 bags.

Another message: The market for foreign Xian rice showed outstanding conditions. The brokers reported that the price of Jiangbei products was not loose, and it was difficult to profit from transportation. In addition, the Shanghai market price was low, and there was more exclusive Wuhu rice from the east, so most of them stopped transporting. In addition to the retail household continuous operation outside this street, the inland gangs also had continuous packaging due to the low price, so the market improved again, but because of the large accumulation of stocks, the east bank lowered the price of Wuhu, so it still followed the market retail release. Therefore, although the market was tight, the market was only 1 or 2 corners.

### Flour Guest Orders Still Upright, Wheat Rises Sharply

Flour: Yesterday's spot flour transactions gradually turned sluggish. Both the North and South gangs had greed, but the factories were unwilling to supply large quantities, and the goods previously handled by the guest gang were not cleared, so new transactions have declined. The market is limited, and the retail price on this street is still only 7.3 yuan. The factory does not increase in order to maintain it, and the unified market transaction volume is less than 30,000 bags. Guest orders continue to open at 7.4 yuan, and the Cannon Cart brand still needs a price of 7.5 yuan. The market is brewing, and 8,000 bags of flour were transported to Hong Kong today.

Wheat: Yesterday's arrival was still rare. Due to the firm and expensive production price, the sellers insisted on staying in the warehouse and waiting for the opportunity to sell. The flow of goods in the market is decreasing day by day. The factories also need more raw materials after the recent active powder sales, and the hoarders also pulled it in. The market is stepping up, and the Unified Market Fuxin and Fufeng factories handle more than 20,000 bags of Changxi Jingsu and Guandian wheat. The hoarders also bought five or six cars, and the highest price has reached 11 yuan, which is a sharp increase of 3 to 4 yuan compared to before.

### Miscellaneous Grains Soybeans and Sesame, Different Tendencies

Recently, the source of soybeans has been blocked from time to time, so few large batches have arrived. Although there is no possibility of procurement for the inland sales, the South China gang has a strong desire. This street is also very enthusiastic. The market price has risen. Yesterday, 7 or 800 bags of Wuhu beans opened at a price of 13.5 yuan, 500 bags of Taicang beans at 14 yuan, 200 bags of Anqing beans at 14.1 yuan to 13.9 yuan, 140 bags of Guidet beans at 13.9 yuan, and 300 bags of Jiujiang Late beans at 15 yuan. The export path of sesame is restricted by the exchange rate, which causes it to watch and not move. Generally, the hoarders' stomachs are therefore idle. Yesterday, only this street took 50 bags of Yangzhou sesame at 28.5 yuan, and the market quotation was 6 or 7 yuan lower than the previous market.

Today there are 800 bags of beans, 190 bags of sesame, 2,540 cans of vegetable oil, 200 cans of sesame oil, all transported to Hong Kong. There are also 1,100 bags of mung beans transported to Yantai.

### Sugar Market Sliced Green Opens More Than a Thousand Baskets

28 Yuan

Yesterday, coarse white was slightly loose. The association's market price for this warehouse's spot goods was 54 yuan, the outside warehouse was 55 yuan, old goods were 54 yuan, re-export goods were 42.5 yuan, Taikoo Che Bai B mark was 58.8 yuan to 8.5 yuan, Che Chi and He Chi had no ups and downs, Ben Mianbai and Ben Bing both fell by 0.5 yuan. The National Sugar Sliced Green opened 1,100 baskets of Beihai goods at 28 yuan, which was 10 yuan smaller than the highest price. Ordinary Huizhou Bai, more than 40 bags, was 53 yuan. It is heard that Shantou sugar has a foreign sugar tax, and if it is true, it is expected to rise.

### North and South Goods Peaches, Apricots, and Red Dates All Rise

Two batches of new Tianjin red dates and recently arrived Leling goods have opened yesterday. Hengda had 48 bags, Zao Wang rose to 230 yuan, Shuangfu head household was 85 yuan, Shuanglu second household was 65 yuan, Fugui Youtou household was 40 yuan, and Tongyichang opened a batch of Changping peaches, 75 yuan, Fuxingxiang opened 12 bags of Leling red dates, Zao Wang was 140 yuan, Gaohongzaotou household was 130 yuan, the same price for the first and second households, and Hengda opened dragon king hat almonds at a higher price of 360 yuan, the next one was 340 yuan, bitter apricots were 128 yuan, and miscellaneous red dates included Changhong red dates at 22 yuan, Zou County Fu Hong called 37.5 yuan, the next one was 36 yuan to 34 yuan, Haozhou peach rose by 3 yuan and traded at 55 yuan, black dates were still weak, opening at 70 yuan to more than 30 yuan. 2,500 bags of sugar were transported from Hong Kong yesterday.

### The Heroic Loyalty and Martyrdom Re-emerge in My Mind, The Second Anniversary of the Lone Army, Commander Xie's Speech Encouraged Everyone to Stand Guard, Shanghai People Enthusiastically Participated in the Commemoration Ceremony

Yesterday was the second anniversary of the 88th Division Lone Army's old battle at the Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei. The 400 officers and soldiers of the Sihang Lone Army, residing in the Lone Army barracks on Jiaozhou Road, under the leadership of Commander Xie Jinyuan, specially held a commemoration ceremony yesterday afternoon. More than a hundred guests from all walks of life participated. The situation at that time was extremely heroic and enthusiastic. The details are recorded below:

### Four Hundred Warriors in High Spirits

Yesterday was the anniversary of the Lone Army's old battle at the Sihang Warehouse, and the White Russian team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps stationed at the Lone Army barracks on Jiaozhou Road had especially strict precautions. Armed White Russian Volunteers patrolled around from time to time. Yesterday, more than 100 representatives from all walks of life participated, and some presented souvenirs such as mirror frames. The commemoration venue was set up in the open space in front of the auditorium. A pine and cypress arch was erected in front of the auditorium, with the Party emblem and the Premier's last words hanging on it. On that day, the four hundred warriors were all in high spirits and full of enthusiasm, allowing the people of the isolated island to see the heroic posture of the National Army again, and could not help but be excited.

### Eloquent and Passionate Speech by the Battalion Commander

At approximately 3:00 PM, a memorial was held with all the visiting guests of the Lone Battalion. Commander Xie delivered a speech, briefly stating, "Today marks the day our battalion entered the Sihang Warehouse to begin the resistance. The five days until the 30th were a period of fighting the enemy within the Sihang Warehouse. The 31st marks the day we retreated under the order of the Supreme Commander, which is also

Our Miserable Life

The beginning of our two-year anniversary. Among the guests present today are: firstly, families of officers and soldiers; secondly, compatriots who have enthusiastically served our battalion; thirdly, leading figures in the cultural sector; and others who have shared life and death with us. It can be said that those who participate today are all on the same battle line. Our goals are the same, our steps are consistent, and we all advance towards the supreme

Nation Above All Else

Nationality above all else. We strive for revival, survival, and a bright and great avenue. However, each person's position is different. Therefore, what I must report first can also be said to be a regular family report, and I ask for your guidance. Recalling 1936, our division had already prepared for the Shanghai war. At that time, the designated defense area of our division started from Wusong Town, eastward through the Wusong Fort, and northeastward through the Shizilin Fort, to Liuhe, Yanglinkou, and Qiyakou. The person in charge of our division was responsible for

Terrain Reconnaissance

Operational deployments, mobilization, transportation plans, etc. Around May 1937, the defense area changed, and we were transferred from Wusong to Zhabei. From this time until August 13, Jin Yuan was making battle deployments in the vicinity of Shanghai. Our division mobilized around the Xicheng area on the evening of August 11 and arrived in Shanghai. Later, Yuan led a battalion to defend the Sihang Warehouse to the death, and then received

Supreme Commander

Orders to retreat. For a soldier, obedience is paramount. Seeking to avoid danger in the face of adversity is not the action of a soldier. However, from the beginning, I determined that regardless of future environmental changes, safety, or danger, I would never care. The honor of the country and the personality of revolutionary soldiers must stand firm and not compromise in the slightest. The leader's instructions are: life and death are small matters, personality is a major matter. In the past two years, my every word and action has been based on this principle to deal with the environment. And recalling the life of the past two years, in

Material Terms

We have never been concerned. What we cannot tolerate is spiritual suffering. I have made three official requests for release. In short, the current responsibility of the people is to resist Japan and build the country, which is an inevitable and arduous part of the national revolution. Compatriots should not forget the

Words of Gold

"The nation is in peril, every citizen is responsible." The eight months of the war are not simple or easy. All Chinese citizens should guard their posts and do their best, according to the principle of contributing money and strength, and then they will surely achieve final victory.

Bridge No. 34 on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway

### Already Blown Up

Japanese Troops in Fengjing Surrounded and Annihilated

Civilians in Xitang Massacred

The mobile units of the Chinese regular army, which were continuously moving north from the source of the Qiantang River, arrived at their designated locations along both sides of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway area, and began active operations. The safety of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is now a thing of the past, and it is in danger of being cut off by the Chinese army at any time. Between the 21st and 22nd, a large number of fully armed Chinese troops, from an unknown location, launched a large-scale encirclement and attack on the Japanese stronghold in Fengjing Town, which borders Jiangsu and Zhejiang. There was also sufficient prior deployment, and all telegraph lines were cut off, causing dozens of Japanese troops at Fengjing Station to be like turtles in a jar,

Suffering Annihilation

Meanwhile, a separate team of engineers was dispatched to destroy two foreign railway bridges between Shihudang and Fengjing at night, including the famous Bridge No. 34. In fact, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been interrupted due to the destruction of the bridge. After completing the major mission, the Chinese army triumphantly withdrew. The next morning, Japanese troops from Jiashan and Songjiang received the report and dispatched reinforcements, suspecting that the Chinese army came from Xitang Town, 30 miles west of Fengjing, so they sent a team to Xitang,

Surrounding All Sides

However, the town was inhabited entirely by villagers, without a single Chinese soldier. They indiscriminately set fire to some of the houses, and many civilians were sacrificed. According to the victims who fled to Shanghai the night before, they walked to Songjiang before being able to take a bus to Shanghai. The bridge destroyed by the Chinese army is under repair, so the train has not been able to pass through there.

### Postal Workers at the Post Office Went on Strike Yesterday En Masse Demanding Uniform Subsidies Zha Peilin Has Not Expressed His Opinion It Is Uncertain Whether Work Will Resume Today

More than 1,000 personnel, including postal workers, coolies, and other staff below the rank of postal workers, from the Postal Administration and its affiliated branches and inland bureaus, went on strike suddenly due to the subsidy issue. This matter had not been resolved as of last night, so it is still uncertain whether the post office will be able to resume the transportation and delivery of mail today. After the incident occurred, in order to avoid accidents, the police dispatched a patrol car and sent several Chinese and foreign police officers and detectives to suppress the area around the Postal Administration. They remained on guard until late at night, with the situation unresolved.

### The Reason for the Strike Originated from Subsidies

Yesterday's strike by postal workers, coolies, and all personnel below them was caused by the subsidy issue. It originated from the Postal Headquarters' approval to provide a universal subsidy of 7.5 yuan to postal workers in Shanghai with salaries below 190 yuan, including postal messengers and coolies, starting in July. However, recently, the Shanghai Post Office received instructions from the Headquarters to revise the regulations, increasing the subsidy for postal staff with salaries below 190 yuan to 10 yuan, while the subsidy for messengers, postal coolies, and other staff below them remained at 7.5 yuan. Upon learning of the above news, all messengers and other staff believed that the subsidy was to compensate for the loss caused by soaring prices, similar to the nature of the subsidy increase in 1930 due to the cheapness of silver and high cost of gold, and should not be differentiated by salary level. Therefore, they submitted a request to the Postal Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, requesting that the subsidy for messengers and other personnel be universally increased to 15 yuan. Before the Postal Headquarters approved it, they agreed to follow the example of postal staff and increase it to 10 yuan.

### Strike Occurred Suddenly on Payday

The above request was rejected by the Shanghai Postal Director, Zha Peilin, on the grounds that it needed to be submitted to the Postal Headquarters for review and approval before it could be handled according to the Headquarters' instructions. The opinions of both parties differed, and the disagreement brewed until yesterday morning. Because the payday of the post office (28th) was approaching, the strike occurred. Yesterday's sudden strike occurred at 9:00 AM, so the express mail, registered mail, and regular mail shifts of the Headquarters still departed and distributed as usual at 8:00 AM. The departure time of the early shifts of messengers at various branches was 9:00 AM, so they stopped departing and distributing. After 10:00 AM, postal workers, messengers, chauffeurs, and machinists all took the same action, causing the work of importing and exporting packages to foreign countries to come to a standstill. However, although the postal workers took a strike stance, they all reported to their service bureaus as usual, stayed at the bureaus as usual, and followed the office hours to enter and leave, and the order was still very orderly.

### Postal Authorities Have Not Expressed Anything

The postal workers then formed a delegation, with each unit sending six representatives, from 18 units, including the regular mail group, express mail group, and mechanic group (based on groups) directly under the Administration, and the branch bureaus and inland bureaus (based on bureaus). Each of the six representatives elected a chairman to form a presidium to supervise all postal workers. It was also learned that the delegation discussed at the postal office at 4:00 PM yesterday and decided to continue petitioning the postal authorities for an increase in subsidies today. A reporter from the Datong News Agency visited Wang Weisheng, the Postal Superintendent, at 5:00 PM yesterday. According to Wang, Postal Director Zha Peilin forwarded the workers' request to the Postal Headquarters for review and approval on the 18th of this month, and then sent a telegram to inquire again on Tuesday of this week. Therefore, before the Headquarters responds, it is not convenient to express anything. Unexpectedly, this kind of incident occurred suddenly today. The post office is a public service undertaking and cannot be suspended even for a moment. He believed that the postal workers would resume work today, and also said that the bureau maintained the delivery of express mail as usual yesterday, and all departments also worked as usual.

### Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond the Border Second Meeting to Be Held Next Week The Municipal Council's Proposal Is Still Being Drafted The Pseudo-Side's Preliminary Conditions Have Been Rejected

Regarding the issue of road construction beyond the border, judging from the development in recent days, the Municipal Council and the Pseudo-Municipal Government have a strong atmosphere of compromise, and it seems that there is hope for an immediate resolution. However, according to news obtained by foreigners yesterday, during the meeting between Frankling and Fu Xiaoan on the evening of the 23rd, Fu proposed two preliminary conditions, requesting that the Municipal Council recognize the Pseudo-Municipal Government's authority to manage all police and administrative affairs of the roads beyond the border, before there would be room for discussion. Frankling did not accept it at the time and put forward several counter-proposals. As of yesterday, the Municipal Council publicly stated, "It will never give up its important rights and interests regarding road construction beyond the border." What are the important rights and interests? Police power and administrative power. Whether Frederick's draft "Proposal Outline" is to acknowledge the preliminary conditions put forward by Fu Xiaoan and formulate a plan is currently impossible to know. However, according to observations in diplomatic circles, because the desires of the pseudo-side are very extravagant, the prospect of negotiations is not very optimistic.

### Three Negotiations to Be Held Next Week

The Public Concession authorities maintained extreme silence yesterday regarding the plan to resolve the issue of road construction beyond the border in western Shanghai, which is currently being drafted, and refused to disclose the content. A reporter visited Frederick, the Director-General and Chairman of the Municipal Council, yesterday. Frederick said that the proposal had not yet been drafted. The reporter asked what kind of proposal would be sent to Fu Xiaoan. Frederick replied that he was not prepared to make any statements. However, it was learned from other well-informed sources that the Municipal Council's proposal would be sent to the Pseudo-Municipal Government within the week, and formal negotiations between the representatives of both parties would begin next week. As for the situation of road construction beyond the border in western Shanghai, it remained normal yesterday. Municipal Council police were still on high alert in the area, and patrol cars were also patrolling back and forth. At the same time, many residents of the roads beyond the border were looking for houses to prepare for relocation, because they were afraid that after the negotiations were concluded, some parts of the area would not be very suitable for living.

Council Discussing Proposal Content

The North China Daily News said that Frederick, the Director-General and Chairman of the Municipal Council, and Major Bowen, the Chief of the Police Department, were drafting several proposals yesterday (25th) aimed at resolving the dispute over the roads outside the western district. When the plan reaches the final stage, it will be submitted to the "Special Municipal Government" "Mayor Su Fu Xiaoan. It is expected that this proposal will be submitted within this week. According to Frederick, the details of the proposal will not be announced until some agreement is reached between the two authorities. It is heard that the Municipal Council held a meeting yesterday afternoon in order to complete the plan to be submitted by the Council to the Jiangwan "Municipal Government" as soon as possible.

Both Parties Put Forward Preliminary Conditions

Yesterday, it was heard from responsible sources that when the Public Concession authorities, Fu Xiaoan, the Japanese Consul General, and the Consular Corps held an informal discussion on Monday, Fu put forward two requirements as "preliminary conditions" for resolving the issue of roads outside the border. Fu's requirements were (1) complete police power in the disputed area and (2) complete management power. However, it is acknowledged that the Council did not accept these requirements and put forward a counter-proposal. The content of the counter-proposal has not been disclosed. It is also heard that the "Municipal Government" has not accepted this counter-proposal.

Extending the Vehicle Tax Is Only a Courtesy

Fu Xiaoan told reporters yesterday that these two issues are preliminary conditions for resolving the entire problem. When these requirements are accepted, he is willing to study the financial aspects of the incident, and will inquire about how much the Public Concession Standing Bureau spends in the area outside the border and the amount of taxes collected in the area, and will consider the "profit and loss statement" in order to fairly resolve the financial issues. The date of the continued meeting has not been determined. Fu also denied saying that he had made concessions on the issue of collecting "vehicle taxes" in the western district, and said that the collection date was originally set for November 1st, but it was only a courtesy that he delayed the date. Two months later, the vehicle tax will be collected additionally.

Japanese Police in the Western District Requested to Withdraw

Regarding the Public Concession Police Department strengthening its police force outside the border in response to the current state of lawlessness in the area, a Japanese newspaper once stated that there were no Japanese police officers among the police personnel dispatched to the western district. It has now been confirmed that the Japanese police officers stationed in the western district requested to withdraw three weeks ago, because they strongly opposed being on duty in the area, as it was contrary to Japanese policy. Also, the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that Frederick and Bowen continued to draft proposals yesterday (26th) to be submitted to Fu Xiaoan, and there were no other developments.

The Situation in Western Shanghai Remains Tense

The repeated disputes over road construction beyond the border in western Shanghai have deeply aroused the attention of the citizens of this city. Since the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" held mutual talks, the situation in western Shanghai has been slightly stable in the past two days. In addition to the Police Department dispatching additional detectives to Yuyuan Road, Jessfield Road, Great Western Road, and Edinburgh Road, British garrison troops have also built a fortress each at the intersection of Yuyuan Road, the intersection of Edinburgh Road, and the intersection of Great Western Road for defense. At the same time, police officers wearing yellow uniforms" are still directing traffic at various intersections. There are also "armed police" with rifles stationed near Zhaofeng Park, so Jessfield Road and other places with heavy traffic have become deserted, while Connaught Road has become an important transportation route.

### U.S. Navy Day Today It Is Decided to Forgo Extravagance Due to the Overall Situation There Is No Commemorative Program and No Visitors Are Allowed

The Shanghai Times reported that the U.S. Navy will observe the Navy Day on October 27th, as in the past, to show the progress and achievements of the U.S. fleet. It is heard that the U.S. Navy stationed in Shanghai will not follow the example of previous years this year. Due to the global situation, it has been decided to forgo the usual commemorative program and not allow American citizens to board the U.S. ships in Shanghai for visits. Moreover, the U.S. ships in Shanghai will not be decorated as usual

Navy Program

As in previous years. President Roosevelt has declared this day a holiday. The United States will undoubtedly celebrate this holiday enthusiastically as usual, but in Shanghai, this holiday will pass quietly without any commemorative activities. The reason why the United States chose October 27th as the Navy Day is because it is the

U.S. President

The birthday of Theodore Roosevelt, who advocated vigorously developing the navy during his tenure. The establishment of the famous American "Great White Fleet" during World War I was largely due to his efforts. Another interesting thing is that American law stipulates that warships must be named after the names of various states, while other warships are named according to

Traditional Customs

For example, cruisers are named after cities, destroyers are named after naval ministers or naval heroes, aircraft carriers are named after famous battles, and submarines are named after fish. Other examples include naval transport ships named after marine generals, tugboats named after rivers, minesweepers named after birds, coal ships named after stars, and medical ships named "Mercy" "Relief" and other names.

Pseudo-Side Forcibly Relocating Orphanage Middle School

No. 11 Jessfield Road, a part of the 31st Refugee Shelter, the elderly and those with no support, were all sent to the No. 1 Shelter of the Dunxin Road Association yesterday. However, it is heard that the Orphanage Middle School is now encountering the same fate as the Refugee Shelter and has also received a notice from the Japanese puppet government to relocate within a time limit. The sponsoring charity group is unable to cope with the situation due to environmental constraints and has decided to close the school. Regarding the post-closure arrangements for the orphans, it is stipulated that those with families will be dispersed, and the rest will be arranged by the Education Department of the Refugee Relief Association.

The Incident of Robbing Weapons and the Border Area

At 3:30 PM yesterday, Si Kai at No. 754, Lane 171, Yanping Road, was suddenly attacked by four thugs and robbed of a pistol he was wearing. The trend of thugs attacking patrolmen and stealing pistols seems to have spread to the border area of the concession, so the border area of the concession, such as Edinburgh Road, Yuyuan Road, and Robison Road, was heavily guarded by the concession authorities from yesterday, and armored vehicles patrolled back and forth all day long.

The Northern District Issue Has Reached a Deadlock

The spokesman of the Japanese Embassy mentioned the issue of road construction beyond the border in the northern district of Suzhou River at the press conference the day before, saying that it had already reached the point of resolution. Due to the Jessfield Road incident, the negotiations were on the verge of breaking down. On August 22, the Japanese Consul Miura Yoshiaki wrote to the Municipal Council, stating, "In view of the Jessfield Road incident, the Japanese side has decided to postpone the return of the Hongkou area to the concession authorities." This means that the issue of road construction beyond the border in the Hongkou district has reached a deadlock again.

### Language Exhibition Opens on the 3rd of Next Month

The language exhibition has been prepared for a long time. The day before yesterday, a banquet was held at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club to invite celebrities from all walks of life in the city to discuss the exhibition and display methods, and it was very successful.

### Yuan Ying's Whereabouts Have Been Revealed Detained in Jiangwan

Yuan Ying, the chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, who was arrested at the Yuanming Sutra Lecture Hall on Great Western Road a few days ago, has been missing for nine days since the incident. Although various parties have tried to rescue him, he has not been released. He is still secretly detained in a certain military unit in Jiangwan, but he is still treated well.

### Tram Token Coupons Still Difficult to Recover Shanghai Tram Company's Letter States The Number of Fractional Coupons Is Truly Insufficient

Regarding the issue of fractional currency coupon circulation, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation recently sent a letter to the Central Bank, requesting the prompt issuance of the second batch of fractional currency coupons, and also sent a letter to the Shanghai Tram Company and the French Concession Tram Company, requesting that they recover the price coupons within a time limit, so that the transitional state caused by the lack of small change can come to an end as soon as possible. The Federation received a letter from the Shanghai Tram Company yesterday, stating that the new fractional currency coupons have been circulated in the market, and it is requested that our company recover the tram price coupons within a time limit. After observing our company, the number of new fractional currency coupons in circulation is truly insufficient, so our company's tram price coupons are currently indispensable for passengers to redeem. Our company also sincerely hopes that your Federation can promptly request the Central Bank to expedite the issuance of the new fractional currency coupons required by the public, so that they can be widely and fully circulated in the market, and then our company's tram price coupons can be recovered within a time limit. In addition, all sectors are eagerly awaiting the issuance of the Central Bank's second batch of 500,000 yuan in fractional currency coupons as soon as possible. It is heard that the Central Bank plans to ship them to Shanghai in early November, and they will be issued at that time.

### The Haita Wheel Has Already Set Sail Yesterday Some Passengers Did Not Agree to Refund the Tickets There Was No Way to Refuse and Followed the Wheel to Ningbo

The Haita Wheel, managed by the Norwegian business Hualun Foreign Company, joined the Shanghai-Ningbo line. It was originally scheduled to go to Ningbo for the second time the day before yesterday. The cargo was full, and more than 700 passenger tickets were sold in advance. Because it was a cargo ship and there was no other cabin equipment, all the tickets sold were for steerage. It was originally scheduled to export at noon on the 25th, but because the cargo was not loaded in time, it was changed to 4:00 PM. Just as it was about to set sail, Hualun Foreign Company suddenly received a notice from the Norwegian Consul that the wheel was not allowed to carry passengers, so it cooperated with the Zhongyi Company, which was the agent of the wheel, and sent personnel to the ship to explain to the passengers, and posted a notice on the side of the ship, asking passengers to exchange tickets for the Deping Wheel or refund their tickets. Therefore, it could not be set, and it was changed to export at midnight on this day. Unexpectedly, some passengers refused to exchange tickets, refused to refund tickets, and refused to leave the ship. Although the crew, company staff, and others tried their best to persuade them, it was all in vain. They sat on the ship, so it was impossible to set sail again the night before, and it was delayed until yesterday morning. The company continued to send Li Zhiyi, Chen Jishan, and seven or eight other people, carrying cash, to the ship to persuade them and handle ticket refunds and other procedures. As a result, only some passengers refunded their tickets and changed tickets to go ashore at that time, while some passengers still lingered and refused to refund or exchange their tickets. By 1:00 PM, it was impossible to proceed. The wheel could not be delayed any longer, so it set sail for Ningbo with some passengers at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The Moufu Wheel of the Lihe Foreign Company was full of cargo, and 4,000 passengers also left Shanghai for Zhenhai at about 12:00 PM yesterday.

### It Is Forbidden for Money Shops and Pawnshops to Mortgage and Pawn Gold Those Who Have Already Been Pledged Are Limited to Exchanging Legal Tender Within One Month The Situation in Shanghai Is Special Hope to Handle It Automatically

In order to strengthen the government's gold reserves, in addition to explicitly banning the private sale of gold last month, and ordering the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural banks to handle the exchange of gold and metal ornaments in various silver shops at legal prices for legal tender at any time, the Chongqing headquarters of the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural banks recently issued a new ordinance on the 22nd of this month, prohibiting the storage and mortgage of gold. The new ordinance prohibits banks and money shops from using gold as loan collateral, and pawnshops from pawning gold. Those who have already stored and mortgaged gold are required to report to the four banks or branches in detail within 30 days, and exchange it for legal tender at the price. Otherwise, all will be confiscated, and a penalty of 50 times the value will be imposed. The branches of the four banks in Shanghai have also followed the instructions of the ministry to handle this matter of collecting gold. It is heard that the procedures for collecting and exchanging gold and silver have been handled by the four banks as usual before and after the war. Now that the ministry has ordered banks, money shops, and pawnshops to report all stored and mortgaged gold to the branches of the four banks in detail and exchange it for legal tender, this is a government order, and the branches of the four banks in Shanghai will of course not be an exception. However, it is hoped that the authorities of the money shops and pawnshops should immediately follow the instructions of the ministry and come to handle the procedures for exchanging gold for legal tender within this time limit. The price will be calculated according to the Central Bank's listed exchange rate, and a handling fee, bonus, and premium will be paid at the same time to encourage them.

### Impersonating Bank Staff to Handle Deposit and Withdrawal Procedures: Fraudulently Obtaining Money and Arrested; Investigation Reveals Four Previous Offenses

Li Qingyun from Zhenjiang, formerly employed by a certain bank, became idle after being laid off. He conceived a peculiar idea: exploiting his familiarity with banking procedures, he loitered around the inquiry desks of various major banks. If he encountered someone naive intending to deposit or withdraw money, he would impersonate a bank employee and approach them, offering to write deposit slips or handle withdrawals on their behalf, using this opportunity to

defraud them of valuables.

On the 18th of this month, at 1:50 PM, Yu A'gen, the owner of Xinglong Restaurant at 46 Huaji Road, took 500 legal tender yuan to the Savings Society of the Four Banks on Hankou Road for deposit. Because Yu could not write, he was inquiring when he happened to meet Li Qingyun. Li stepped forward, impersonating a staff member of the Savings Society, offering to write for him and handle the deposit. Yu handed over the money. Unexpectedly, Li, after counting the money, attempted to flee. Yu discovered this and reported it to the police. Detective Wang Shusheng was dispatched to take Li, along with the original amount, to the General Patrol Station and transferred him to the First Special Court for

detention pending trial.

It is learned that the case is being rescheduled. Detectives discovered that Li had committed three additional cases of fraud and theft: (1) On January 30th of this year, Li, impersonating Wang Shuping, the manager of the Savings Society of the Four Banks, contacted Lei Yunsheng National Pharmacy on North Henan Road by telephone, intending to purchase pearl powder. After initial negotiations, Li went there the next day, stating he wanted to buy three taels of pearl powder at 180 yuan per tael. He asked for it to be delivered by shop assistants. Consequently, shop assistants Weng Shouchen and Sun Changsheng accompanied Li with the pearl powder to the Savings Society of the Four Banks. As it was lunchtime, Li told the two assistants to wait in the reception room while he

went into the manager's office.

Shortly after, he came out, saying the manager needed to see the goods. The two assistants, unsuspecting, handed over the pearl powder, witnessing Li enter the manager's office. Unexpectedly, he did not reappear for a long time. When they pushed the door open, they realized there was a small door leading to the outside. Asking the tea server, they learned they had been tricked and returned to the shop to report it to the police. (2) On August 15th of this year, a merchant from Jiangbei, Fu Yusheng, took a 2,000 yuan check to the Jin Cheng Bank on Jiangxi Road for encashment. Unexpectedly, he met Li Qingyun again, who impersonated a staff member, claiming he could simplify the withdrawal process, thereby getting the check cashed and

fleeing with the money.

(3) On July 15th of this year, a woman from Qidong County, Jiangdong, Lan Yicui, brought a passbook to the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road, intending to withdraw 500 yuan. She also met Li Qingyun, who offered to handle the withdrawal on her behalf, and Li absconded with the passbook. After discovering this, she urgently asked the bank to stop payment, but 500 yuan had already been withdrawn. 429 yuan and 92 cents remained, luckily not yet taken. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Li to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit according to the law. As only a

representative from Lei Yunsheng had appeared in court today,

and the others had not arrived, he requested a postponement. Subsequently, Sun Changsheng, an employee of Lei Yunsheng, complained about being deceived and stated that the stolen goods had been recovered in February of this year. At the time, due to the repeated pleas of the defendant's parents, wife, and family, they had not handed him over to the police. When questioned, Li Qingyun confessed to the accusations, admitting the money had been spent. Judge Dai instructed the defendant to be detained and the hearing rescheduled for seven days.

### Lost Children Seeking Claimants

(1) A girl named Jinmei, five years old, went missing on September 20th at Haig Road and Jing'an Temple Road. The Jing'an Temple Road police reported this to the Children's Protection Section of the Public Works Department. Because the child was young and unable to provide any information, the Protection Section, noting that the child was covered in scabies, sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment. The child has now recovered and has been transferred to the Children's Shelter of the Tzu Chi Association, awaiting her family to claim her.

(2) A boy named Zhang Shengda, eleven years old, from Changshu, went missing on October 14th at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yu Qiaqing Road. The Old Gate Police Station reported this to the Children's Protection Section of the Public Works Department. According to inquiries, the child came to Shanghai with his mother from the countryside at the beginning of October to make a living. On the 14th, his mother took him shopping on Nanjing Road and told him to wait in front of a certain shop. Unexpectedly, his mother disappeared. It was also stated that the child's paternal grandfather works at the Santong Teahouse in the countryside of Changshu. Therefore, the Protection Section sent a quick letter informing him to come to Shanghai to claim the child. As of October 25th, the child's parents had not yet come to claim him, causing the child great anxiety. Currently, the child is temporarily being sheltered by the Children's Shelter of the Tzu Chi Association. (3) A boy named Xilin, six years old, from Shaoxing, went missing on October 20th at 1:15 PM at the intersection of Tokyo Road and Connaught Road. The Gordon Road Police Station reported this to the Children's Protection Section of the Public Works Department, who transferred him to the Relief Group of the Tzu Chi Association for shelter. According to the investigation, when the boy was sent to the police station, there was a red paper in his pocket, which read: "My son Xilin, from Shaoxing, is six years old this year. His parents are currently unemployed and unable to support him, so they abandon him on the road. We hope kind-hearted people will send him to the police station, saving a life, a great merit." The Tzu Chi Association sincerely hopes that the child's parents can change their minds about abandonment and come to complete the procedures for claiming him. If there is no indication in the near future, they will consult with the Children's Protection Section to allow reliable people to adopt him, ending his relationship with his biological parents.

### Truth Revealed in Apartment Murder Case: Victim Was a Kidnapper; Paternal Uncle Avenged the Murder, Four Suspects Detained for Investigation

On the 21st of this month, around 10:00 PM, the body of an unidentified man, strangled to death, was discovered in the washroom on the second floor of the apartment at 1920 Avenue Joffre. After the incident, the French Police issued orders to Chinese and Western detectives to strictly pursue the culprits and solicit information from the public to solve the case as soon as possible, as reported in this newspaper. Until the night of the 24th, the police, based on the

report of an Ayah

employed by a Westerner in the apartment, detained Qian Jiesheng, a 22-year-old from Haizhou (who worked as a shop assistant for a Westerner at 1908 Avenue Joffre). He was taken to the police station and confessed the truth. The next morning, Zhang Rongshu, the main culprit, a 22-year-old from Siyang (residing at 115 Carter Road, working as a garbage collector), and accomplices Zhao Yuyin (21-year-old from Siyang) and Xu Jixian (21-year-old from Hebei) were apprehended. Yesterday, all four were transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, requesting detention for an extended period for

further investigation.

When questioned, the defendant Zhang Rongshu confessed that the deceased was named Ding Lezhi, 32 years old this year, from Siyang, Jiangsu. During his lifetime, he was a notorious kidnapper in his hometown, rampant for a time. On July 17th of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), Ding Lezhi kidnapped several sons of wealthy families, intending to hide them in my house. At the time, my grandfather Zhang Guolun and uncle Zhang Xiaokouzi strongly refused. Ding held a grudge in his heart. The next day, he used a gun to kill my grandfather and uncle. This time, Ding suddenly came to Shanghai and was encountered on the road,

a chance encounter.

He was lured to my home and treated as an honored guest, with great courtesy. The next day, he was lured to the scene of the incident. I begged my friends Zhao Qian and Xu to help, and Ding was strangled to death with a rope. It was entirely to avenge the murder of my ancestors, out of filial piety, with no other motives. I request an investigation, etc. When questioned, the defendants Zhao Yuyin, Qian Jiesheng, and Xu Jixian confessed to helping commit the murder without denial. Judge Miao verified the statements and decided to reschedule the hearing for November 9th. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Landlord Repeatedly Fails to Raise Rent, Forcing Tenant to Move Out, Refusing Rent Payment, Court Mediation Fails

The house at 194 Rue du Consulat, French Concession, is managed by Weikang Estate Agency. Lu Fengbiao, a tin merchant, rents and resides there, with a monthly rent of 126 national currency yuan, paid in advance. A lease agreement was signed between the two parties. However, Zhu Meisun of Weikang Estate Agency, having failed to increase the rent three times, recently filed a petition with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting

mediation for eviction.

Upon receiving the petition, the court, presided over by Judge Yuan, conducted mediation in the Fourth Civil Court. Zhu Meisun, the petitioner, stated the reasons for requesting the respondent, Lu Fengbiao, to move out, claiming that the respondent owed four months' rent and had built a small house privately. Tang Hao, the lawyer representing the respondent, Lu Fengbiao, stated to the court the reasons for not being able to move out: the respondent has always paid the rent according to the lease agreement. The petitioner is taking advantage of this extraordinary period to

repeatedly demand

rent increases. The respondent has accepted twice, once adding seven yuan and the second time adding fourteen yuan. This summer, the petitioner again attempted to make a third request to increase the rent. The respondent believed that the petitioner was taking an inch and wanting a mile, so he did not accept it. Unexpectedly, the petitioner forcibly demolished a side door of the house. The respondent immediately entrusted this magazine to send a letter to the

petitioner for negotiation,

limiting the petitioner to reinstall the side door within three days, but without result. Subsequently, the petitioner stopped collecting rent. The respondent had prepared sufficient rent and sent a letter urging the petitioner to collect it. Each letter urging the petitioner to collect the rent was sent by registered mail from the post office, with documents as proof. Furthermore, the respondent brought the rent for recent months today, willing to pay it in court. As for the petitioner's claim that the respondent had built a house privately, there is

no basis.

The court then asked the petitioner if he was willing to accept the rent, and the petitioner replied that he did not want the rent and still wanted the respondent to move out. At this point, the court considered that there was no room for mediation and declared that the mediation failed. A lawsuit can be filed separately.

### Weather Forecast

The Xujiahui Observatory's meteorological forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: the weather in Shandong is cloudy and cold, turning clear, with a gentle northwest to northeast wind.

Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 72.7 and the lowest was 50.9. On the same day last year, the highest was 66.4 and the lowest was 58.5.

### Correcting the Mistake of the "Going to School" Issue

— Du Yun

Reading Ms. Jie's article "Sending My Son to School" published in this newspaper on the 23rd, it concerns sending her four-year-seven-month-old son to a model elementary school to study in the first grade. As a result, the school's level was exceptionally high and surpassed the Ministry of Education's order. He was demoted for not being able to write a diary, leaving her to sigh that she had nothing to say. This is a national education issue, and we must not take it lightly. The writer has been an elementary school teacher for more than ten years and dares to offer what he knows to correct the mistakes on both sides.

First, let's talk about the family side: (A) The age of children entering school (entering the first grade of elementary school) is stipulated by the Ministry's order to be six full years old. Now, Ms. Jie's son is only four years and seven months old, so he is naturally not qualified to enter the first grade and can only attend kindergarten. The writer has a four-year-eight-month-old son who has not even entered kindergarten because there is no formal kindergarten near his residence. If there is, it is a high-end type that costs dozens of gold coins every half year, leaving his father teaching while his son has no books to read, so he can only sigh that he has nothing to say. (B) The Ministry's order does not stipulate that the level of children entering school must be able to write their own names (like my son, whose surname and name have many strokes, making it even more difficult) and recognize Arabic numerals, let alone be able to write a diary (which is simply unreasonable). Because they don't know how to read, they need to enter school. However, some parents think that their children are smart and can recognize hundreds of words before they are four or five years old, so they desperately teach them to read, thinking that it will be easier to enter school. This is also a big mistake. It must be known that children's intelligence is limited. Using their brains too much in this way greatly impairs their intelligence, and they will suffer from sluggish thinking in the future. (C) The purpose of children's education is to pursue knowledge, cultivate morality, and train their bodies, so that they can become sound citizens in the future. However, in Shanghai, because living spaces are small and children are too noisy at home, some people send them to school regardless of age and other factors to "confine them." In fact, schools are not prisons for children. It is not appropriate for fathers, let alone mothers, to abandon their responsibility of educating their children in order to enjoy freedom, play mahjong, and watch operas.

Then, let's talk about the school side: (A) Since the Ministry's order has stipulations on the age of enrollment, the principal of the school should not have allowed Ms. Jie's son to enroll in the first place, and there is no need to demote him later because he cannot write a diary. Just say directly: "Your son is too young, I am afraid it is not suitable for entering the first grade." I think Ms. Jie would definitely have nothing to say. (B) As for the level of enrollment, there is actually no standard at all. In Shanghai, in general, those who run schools often find that at the beginning of the school year, the number of applicants for the first grade is overwhelming, while there are not many transfers to other grades, which inevitably reduces tuition revenue and makes it difficult to allocate teachers. So, they set a special standard that surpasses the Ministry's order to determine who to admit. As a result, the first-year students who are admitted have the level of second-year students, teachers can be lazy and do not have to take on the initial enlightenment work, and the principal can also exaggerate that the level of this school is "indeed a bit deeper." The way to correct this is to set the number of places, regardless of the level. Once the number of applicants reaches the limit, no more will be accepted. And teachers should teach based on the standard of those who have never been to school and do not know a single word, which requires the experience and conscience of the teachers. (C) Teachers are poor, poor in that their hard work is unseen, and poor in that their rewards are meager. But if they think of training a group of young citizens for national education, so that they can become sound citizens in the future, they will get a kind of natural pleasure in their spirit. Then, they should explain to the general public, students, and parents who do not understand education, so that they know the importance of children's education, which is not just to "confine them," or to recognize a few words, or to rely on it for a living in the future.

Finally, the writer thinks that the model elementary school mentioned by Ms. Jie, which not only requires first-year students to be able to write diaries, but also requires fifth- and sixth-year students to read classical Chinese, is really unreasonable. It is a model in an inexplicable and absurd way. As for the intention of this article, it is not only aimed at Ms. Jie and the model elementary school, please do not misunderstand.

### Hiring a Private Tutor Scam

— Ironclad Proof

"There's nothing you can't find in Shanghai," that's so true. Indeed, the number of scams, the ingenuity of the plans, and the smoothness of the methods are truly unbelievable. Now, I will report the following incident that I personally experienced:

If you want to earn some money in your spare time, besides writing, then being a private tutor is the most ideal occupation that we poor students generally hope for.

There are so many unemployed people that finding a job is indeed more difficult than ascending to the blue sky. Although I have asked my relatives, friends, and teachers to help me find a position as a private tutor in many ways (naturally, I have also posted in the social services column of the newspaper), what they bring back are always batches of rebuffs and disappointing news.

Two weeks ago, I happened to see an advertisement in the newspaper for hiring a private tutor. The monthly salary was twenty yuan, and I only had to teach English for one hour a day, and there were only two junior high school students. So, with an excited and pounding heart, I visited the address in the newspaper.

It was an imposing mansion, a small Western-style house, located in a very quiet and peaceful place. After I handed over my business card and explained my purpose, the person who came out to greet me was a middle-aged man in his forties, wearing a smart suit and very polite.

The conversation began.

"Sir, do you originally have a job?"

"No, I am studying."

"What school?"

"×× University."

"What department?"

"×× Department."

"Oh! Excellent, excellent!" After a pause, "Do you have any teaching experience?"

"I have also worked as a private tutor before."

"Oh! Then teaching English to two junior high school students is not a problem." Then, "What English classics do you read?"

So, I recited a series of them.

"Then let's talk in English for a while."

Naturally, he wanted to test my level. Indeed, conversation is the easiest and most accurate way to test a person's English level.

After the conversation, he immediately said a lot of compliments and praises. Then, he asked me many irrelevant questions like a judge interrogating a prisoner.

Finally, it was decided that he would decide whether to hire me after a week of trial teaching, and that there would be a travel allowance during the trial teaching period.

Although this was a very harsh requirement, I finally endured and accepted it. And I even thought so naively: Trial teaching is necessary, so as not to take the money and mislead people's studies.

In this way, I went to teach the two junior high school students English at the specified time every day. Naturally, I taught very seriously, not sloppy or perfunctory at all. I admit that I did my best.

Suddenly, on the seventh day, I received a letter from the other party, which said in essence: The child is sick, so I should not go for the time being, and I will be notified after he recovers. So, I waited every day for the news of the child's recovery.

The day before yesterday, I met my old friend Shen (who studied in the Foreign Literature Department of a certain church university and whose English level is indeed good, as we were classmates in middle school), who revealed the truth about this scam.

Similarly, Shen's application was also after seeing the news in the newspaper about hiring a private tutor. Poor thing, he was also only there for six days, and then the same letter shattered his dream of being a private tutor and the illusion and longing for twenty yuan. Recalling what the child said on the first day of class: "Sir! My father is really strict. He always changes teachers every week, saying that the teacher doesn't teach well... You are already the third one." At first, I thought it was a threat and intimidation, but now it powerfully confirms such a scam: Without spending a penny, he first posts an advertisement for hiring a private tutor in the social services column of the newspaper, and then selects from the applicants (he may have a selective meaning in testing the level) those with a better level to let them teach for a week, and then uses the excuse that the child is sick to put the problem aside and complete his clever scam. At the same time, his child enjoys a week of free special tutors.

Although I lost some time, energy, and travel expenses, I gained valuable lessons that cannot be bought.

Finally, I advise those who apply to be private tutors not to repeat the same mistake. If they want you to trial teach, it can only be limited to one hour. At the same time, I hope that gentleman will not do such unconscionable things again. If you do that trick again in the newspaper, then your name may be found in the newspaper.

The comic "Adding New Clothes" on the 25th was created by Mr. Zheng Dingqi, but was mistakenly printed as Zheng Dingrong. We hereby correct it.

### Rain After the Storm

— Bao Xiaotian

He Shuangyu said: "So that's how it is! Why is there the scent of sweet osmanthus? Is it a unique specialty of Changshu?" Zhu Airen said: "No! As far as I know, there are several places in the south that were formerly famous for sweet osmanthus and chestnuts. But now there are more, so it's really not unusual. When we were little, we only knew that Hangzhou had sweet osmanthus chestnuts, Wuxi had sweet osmanthus chestnuts, and then Changshu had sweet osmanthus chestnuts. In Hangzhou, it's at Manjuelong. That place is entirely planted with sweet osmanthus. In the autumn, many tourists go to appreciate the osmanthus and often bring back several woven bags of chestnuts. Because the villagers of Manjuelong plant osmanthus and also grow chestnuts, the chestnut trees are mixed among the osmanthus groves, so they naturally absorb the fragrance. The sweet osmanthus chestnuts of Wuxi are most famous in the area of the Wa Huang Temple. Actually, fruit trees are often grafted, and they often produce very good fruits. For example, if apples and pears are grafted, they will produce a very sweet and crispy apple-pear. If roses and grapes are grafted, they will produce rose grapes with a rose fragrance. There are already many kinds of fruits like these being produced, so there are many kinds of fruits that didn't exist before, but have only appeared recently. Those are all new inventions of horticultural fruit growers. In terms of gustatory delights alone, modern people have a much better deal than ancient people! Because of the matter of grafting fruit trees, some people who study ethnology and eugenics have put forward a theory, saying that the children born from the marriage of people of two races are bound to be excellent. Some people also say: That's not reliable, pure blood is still better after all. But judging from the facts, recently there have been many marriages between our yellow race and the white race, and the children born are indeed mostly excellent. And in recent years, there are more and more Chinese people marrying Europeans and Americans every day." He Liyu said: "To talk about world harmony, we must first eliminate that narrow racial prejudice. Many wars, with killing filling the fields and brains and blood splattering the ground, are all caused by racial prejudice. People think their own race is the noblest in the world, while other people's races are the most humble. I remember more than ten years ago, in continental Europe, the Jews were expelled, leaving them with nowhere to go. It seemed as if there was no place for Jews to live on such a large earth. Isn't that all because of racial prejudice? This kind of extreme and narrow-mindedness must be eliminated before we can talk about world harmony. Like Sister Airen said, children born from interracial marriages are not inferior. Our stepmother, she is born of yellow and white races, and her intelligence and appearance are in no way inferior to others. Furthermore, our two younger brothers, they also carry the white blood of their maternal grandmother, and they are also very outstanding." (195)

Entertainment World

### Global Photographer Stationed in China Goes to Europe to Photograph Newsreels of the European War

— Cheng Zeng

Americans are naturally fond of innovation and are always at the forefront, especially in the film industry. Howard Vena, a newsreel cameraman stationed in China for Universal Pictures, went to Europe last month to photograph newsreels of the European war. Vena was sent to China in 1934 to film the life and scenery of our country and travel newsreels of various countries in the Far East. Four years ago, when the situation between Italy and Abyssinia was tense, he left China for the Philippines to film the Italo-Ethiopian War. He was seriously injured and returned to his home country for half a year of recuperation before he recovered.

When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Vena was ordered to come to China again as Universal's photographer stationed in China. According to him, he had already filmed many newsreels of the Sino-Japanese War and was about to organize them when he suddenly received a telegram from Universal urging him to go to Europe. He had to stop all his current work and leave China in a hurry. He hopes to finish his work in Europe and return to the United States to reunite with his beloved wife and young son, and then come to China again. He also said that when he first came to China, his impression was not good, but after coming to China for the second time, observing with a photographer's eye, his impression was the opposite and very good. He is one of the young newsreel cameramen in the United States. He is 28 years old and has been a newsreel cameraman since he was 17. He has nine years of experience, so Universal ordered him to go to Europe to take on this most difficult job.

### Talking About Cheng Yanqiu (Part 2)

— Guo Duo

Cheng Yanqiu's Acting: The word "acting" includes facial expressions, body movements, stage steps, running the stage, water sleeves, and various movements of sitting on cushions. Speaking of facial expressions, it is closely related to appearance and temperament. Cheng Yanqiu's appearance is dignified and elegant, so his expressions are not frivolous, but he excels at performing tragedies. Also, because he is quiet and rich in emotion, his performance of tragedies is more moving and touching than anyone else; in places of sorrow and melancholy, his furrowed brows evoke endless pity; every move he makes is exceptionally dignified, so he is most able to portray virtuous women and martyrs with great care, touching people's hearts.

Speaking of body movements, it is also related to innate physique. Cheng Yanqiu's height is originally taller than other actors; in recent years, he has become even more plump. Being both tall and plump makes body movements difficult to please, but Cheng Yanqiu can slightly bend his legs to suppress his height and wear loose-fitting clothes to conceal his plumpness, so that during performances, he not only does not appear undignified, but feels even more graceful and blessed.

Cheng Yanqiu's water sleeve skills are ethereal and unrestrained, and running the stage is swift and unparalleled, both of which have reached a state of perfection. As for his stage steps, they are light and natural; sitting on cushions is quick and clean; all are superb skills that cannot be learned overnight.

Cheng Yanqiu's Private Morality: Cheng Yanqiu not only achieved success in singing and acting, but also his private morality is worth discussing: First, Cheng Yanqiu always maintains a humble attitude towards worldly affairs. Because he is humble, he can strive for perfection and constantly create art. The most taboo for people engaged in art is arrogance. It is said that Shang Xiaoyun committed this problem. Second, Cheng Yanqiu is full of affection and righteousness. In the past, Luo Yinggong, a famous scholar in the north, greatly promoted Cheng Yanqiu. Later, Yinggong passed away, and his funeral arrangements were bleak. Cheng Yanqiu, out of gratitude, took care of the funeral and wore mourning clothes. This matter has long been spread throughout the Peking opera circles. From this, one can know that Cheng Yanqiu values affection and righteousness.

Conclusion: Finally, I have one thought: I feel that the success of an art cannot be achieved without going through arduous training and patient research. Don't be afraid of difficulties, don't be afraid of insurmountable obstacles, as long as you have determination, are not hypocritical, hold on to your goals, and work diligently, "man can conquer nature," and anything can be achieved. We not only admire Cheng Yanqiu's superb art, but also respect his spirit of being loyal to art.

### After Watching "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty"

— Hua

Regarding the writing motivation of "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," Mr. Wei Ruhui has already stated the necessary reasons for writing this historical drama in "Preface to the Public Performance of Bi Xue Hua" (see "Chun Qiu" on the 25th)—it was written for a purpose. The night before yesterday, this play was also performed at the Xuan Palace Theater. In the three and a half hours, the enthusiastic emotions of hundreds of spectators were a great comfort to all the staff of this play; at the same time, it proved that the selection of "historical drama" material, as long as it is correctly selected by the playwright, to "reflect reality with the mirror of history," is even more welcomed by the smart audience who share the same feelings.

At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Qing soldiers entered the Pass, and Ma Shiying, Ruan Daxiong, and others surrendered to the barbarians; Zheng Zhilong insisted on territorialism and ruined Zhejiang; and the unyielding spirit of Sun Kejian, Ge Nengniang, and other "Chinese daughters who died for China" were all very similar to the "Chinese resistance at this time and place." Although Zheng Chenggong fled to Taiwan; Sun Kejian, Ge Nengniang, and others were also arrested and executed, this historical lesson is alerting people: Zheng Zhilong, with 800,000 troops, refused to save Zhejiang. He thought that he could live comfortably in Fujian, eating lychees, but when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold, this "hero" who said "being an official is good in the Ming Dynasty, and being an official is also good in the Qing Dynasty" finally reaped his just deserts, and was imprisoned in Nanjing, unable to live or die. The failure of Sun Kejian, Ge Nengniang, and others was also because there were too many "official-minded" people in the Ming Dynasty who only knew about themselves and did not know about the country. But the spirit of Sun Kejian, Ge Nengniang, and others who refused to surrender until death can be passed down forever! In the first act, when Sun Kejian and Yu Danxin asked Ge Nengniang to perform a sword dance, she said: "This is not the place, nor the time!" In the fourth act, when she was captured by Bolo, it was "the time" and "the place." Although she could no longer use the sword as a weapon, she cut off her tongue and spat blood, scolding the bandits to death. Sun Kejian's "My Ming Dynasty has such a female hero, how can I not laugh? Sun San is ascending to heaven today!" This sorrowful and passionate laughter will forever reverberate in our ears!

The arrangement of the four acts is also exquisite and compact. Generally speaking, the third act is relatively poor, because it involves a long process, and it is difficult to take care of everything. However, the typical character of Ma Jinzi is inserted, which not only clarifies the brutality of the Qing soldiers and the people's hatred of the enemy, but also shows that in the autumn of national crisis, regardless of each other, men and women should be loyal to the country, even if it means death.

In the first act, in the brothel in Qinhuai, the relationship between Sun Kejian and Ge Nengniang, Yu Danxin and Li Shiniang, and Cai Ruheng and Wang Weibo is explained, and the Qingliu faction is hated by Ma Shiying. The introduction of the characters and the dialogue are all concise. The climax of the Qing soldiers rushing into Nanjing, and Ge Nengniang's hidden satire of Sun Kejian, tightly grasped the tension and tragic atmosphere in an instant.

The second act, the conflict between Zheng Zhilong and Zheng Chenggong, father and son, should be the most exciting and pleasing act of the play. The division of loyalty and treachery between father and son, mother and son, and uncle and nephew is very clear, and the dialogue is sharp and powerful. As for the section where the singer sings Wang Zhaojun, I think it can be deleted, because she only emphasizes that the merchant women do not know the hatred of the fallen country, and destroying the complete atmosphere of the whole act is not worth the loss.

The fourth act depicts Bolo's lust, and the subtle satire of "shameless" and "dog" is very humorous, but it is even more powerful to incite Mei Niang to stab Cai Ruheng to death; Ge Nengniang scolds the bandits to death; and Sun Kejian calmly dies.

Among the actors: I think Shi Wen, Murong Wan'er, and Tu Guangqi, who played Sun Kejian, Wang Weibo, and Cai Ruheng, are the best. Shi Wen's recitations at the end of the first and fourth acts are passionate and powerful, and his heroic spirit lasts forever. In the fourth act, Murong Wan'er did not know her own decline and wanted to save Ge Nengniang with the sisterhood of Qinhuai, but could not, and could express the mood of a weak woman with a hundred knots of sorrow. Tu Guangqi's "dog thing" is a portrayal of certain characters, making people happy! Tang Ruoqing's Ge Nengniang, the audience who has not seen her for a long time may be seeing her playing such a role for the first time, but the able can do everything, but perhaps after rehearsing for two consecutive nights, her voice is hoarse. Xu Li's Zheng Zhilong, Liu Qiong's Zheng Chengjun, Zhang Zhizhi's Bolo, etc. were also successful.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Gold and Silver Problem in the Ulong Court Play

The value of gold in the Song Dynasty was certainly not as high as the current exchange rate of more than 400 yuan. The silver price was about 100 taels of silver for one tael of gold. (In the past, when coins were used, each yuan was seven qian and two fen. Now, to buy silverware from silver shops using banknotes, it costs about four yuan to buy one tael of silver.) But in any case, the price of gold is always more than ten times higher than silver. When China did not trade with overseas countries, the price of gold must not have fluctuated too much. Let's look at the very clear recitations in the "South Heaven Gate" play, and we can know that gold in the Ming Dynasty was about 14 to 1. The Song Dynasty and the Ming Dynasty were separated by hundreds of years, but the difference between gold and silver must not be too large. Try to see the gold in the early years of the Republic of China, it was only 10 or 20 to 1. From this, we can see the general situation. The words of "South Heaven Gate" are "gold earrings weighing three qian, our gold here is 14 to 1, three pairs of three, three four is one tael and two qian, combined with silver four taels and two qian, plus two hundred big coins." The significance of my specially supplementing this paragraph is to firmly prove that what is stored in Zhao Wen's bag in the "Ulong Court" play is gold and not silver. Even the gold ingot that Liu Tang brought to Song Jiang is similar in size to the fake sycee on the stage. It probably weighs about 20 taels. Let's calculate it according to the value of gold at 14 to 1, wouldn't that be equivalent to 300 taels of silver? This way, Chao Tianwang's stinginess is not revealed, and at the same time, it proves that what I said is "what was taken out later was not the gold ingot that was stuffed into the arms earlier" and is not my arbitrary statement.

### Leisurely Drawing of the Entertainment World (20) Big Drum

— Written by Dong Yun, Illustrated by Xiu Yan

Big drum is a kind of northern entertainment, performed by beautiful women from Yan and Zhao. The description of drum girls in storytelling includes The Travels of Lao Ts'an in the front and A Comedy of Tears and Laughter in the back.

Liu Baoquan and Bai Yunpeng sing the big drum, and Little Hei Guniang and Yang Lianqin also sing the big drum. The lyrics are all the same.

Dirges such as Crying Ancestral Temple and Drumming and Scolding Cao should be sung by Liu Baoquan and others. As for Big West Chamber and Daiyu Returning to Heaven, they are characterized by lingering tenderness and indirection and are only suitable for Little Hei Guniang and others. But they overlooked this point!
