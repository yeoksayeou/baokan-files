Large Chinese forces have deployed to intercept them. The Fourth War Zone Military Law Enforcement Supervisory Department has also dispatched senior inspectors to the front lines to supervise the execution of combat orders by various units. Furthermore, it is reported that 2,000 Japanese troops from Taiping have been transferred to reinforce Chao Shan. (30th dispatch)

(Hong Kong) A Chongqing telegram states that the Japanese army is now adopting a new strategy: a main offensive against Shaanxi, a supporting offensive in central Hubei, a feigned offensive in Hunan and Jiangxi, naval harassment in southern China, and continued efforts to eliminate guerrillas in southern Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, and central China. It is also rumored that they have set a deadline of early July to occupy Zhejiang. The Japanese troops who landed on Chuanshi Island outside the Okou River have retreated. (30th dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to today's Japanese sources, the Japanese side has delayed its blockade of Fuzhou at the request of the British Navy. It has now decided to postpone the blockade for several days to allow British ships to return to Fuzhou to evacuate British nationals. Once the British evacuation is complete, Fuzhou will be completely blockaded. As for the Okou River estuary, it is already completely under blockade. (30th United Press dispatch)

(Fuzhou) At noon on the 29th, multiple Japanese motorboats carrying 200 to 300 Japanese soldiers suddenly attacked Yidouwu (between Changmen and Chuanshi Island) off the Min River estuary, attempting to land. The Chinese garrison waited until they approached the shore before launching a head-on attack. The Japanese soldiers, unable to escape, were killed in significant numbers, and several Japanese boats were also destroyed. The Japanese soldiers, realizing the difficulty of success, retreated. (30th dispatch)

(Fuzhou) After being repelled by Chinese forces, Japanese troops attacking Dongyang Island, part of Pingtan County, again launched an attack on Guanyin'ao in Pingtan on the afternoon of the 29th, under the cover of Japanese warships and aircraft, attempting a forced landing. They were again repelled by Chinese forces and fled back to Japanese warships. (30th dispatch)

(Chongqing) A report from the Chinese front lines in Shantou states that a Chinese detachment, ordered to conduct a rearguard action in Chaozhou to cover the retreat of the main force, is now likely in dire straits, as their retreat route has been cut off by the appearance of Japanese troops northwest of Chaozhou. (30th Reuters dispatch)

Liuhuang: The units tenaciously defending Chaoan County City launched several sorties from the city on the 28th, killing many Japanese soldiers on the spot. The Japanese continuously launched fierce attacks, with intense artillery bombardment. The Chinese defenders still braved death to fight back, engaging in hand-to-hand combat as the Japanese approached. Casualties mounted on both sides. By the afternoon, Japanese aircraft swarmed in, dropping bombs and strafing, turning most of the city into ashes. The Chinese army still used the broken walls and ruins for cover, demanding the greatest possible price from the Japanese with a spirit of certain death. By evening, the number of Japanese troops increased, and a large part of them rushed into the city. The isolated Chinese forces withdrew from Chaozhou City in street-to-street fighting, moving to the Yixi North District area north of the city to await reinforcements and launch a counterattack. Chaoan thus fell completely into Japanese hands. (29th dispatch)

(London) According to a news report from Hong Kong this morning, a British naval detachment has landed in Fuzhou at the request of the British Consul in Fuzhou to protect British nationals. (30th Huitong News Agency dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to a Chinese spokesman, the Japanese occupation of Chaozhou is purely aimed at protecting Shantou and is definitely not a preparation for attacking Shaoguan. If the Japanese army wanted to attack Shaoguan, they should attack from Zengcheng and Conghua to avoid the intervening mountainous areas. As for the current Japanese military actions in the Shantou area, they are nothing more than an attempt to consolidate their position in that area but will definitely not penetrate deep inland. First, the Japanese army will not go deep, so that they can use naval guns as protection. Second, outside Chaozhou, the terrain is favorable to the defenders and unfavorable to the Japanese mechanized units. According to the Chinese side, the silver stored in the Shantou branch of the Guangdong Provincial Bank was transported out in advance without any loss. However, there are silver mines near Shantou, so the Japanese occupation of Shantou can also be regarded as Mitsui's attempt to seize this silver mine. (30th Associated Press dispatch)

It is known that there are currently 26 Japanese warships in Fuzhou. (30th Huitong News Agency dispatch)

(Chongqing) Military sources here confirm that Chaozhou has fallen. Chinese forces are now near Chaozhou, awaiting reinforcements and preparing for a counterattack. It is said that the Japanese side paid a high price in this battle of Chaozhou, with heavy casualties. (30th Huitong dispatch)

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Xiehe Middle School; US Protests

(Hong Kong) According to official US sources here, Japanese aircraft bombed Fuzhou yesterday and destroyed Xiehe Middle School, which is run by American missionaries. Fortunately, no Americans were injured or killed. The US side has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese side. Xiehe Middle School is a school run by Americans. The US side had previously notified the Japanese side of its location and had painted two large American flags on the roof, which the Japanese aircraft should have been able to see. Furthermore, the Japanese aircraft flew very low during the bombing, so there was no possibility of misunderstanding. However, one bomb struck the west side of the school building and immediately started a fire, causing the entire school to be burned to the ground. Mr. and Mrs. Biling, who were in charge of the school, fortunately took refuge in an air-raid shelter and were unharmed. (30th Associated Press dispatch)

Editorial

### The Knotty Problem of Foreign Exchange in Shanghai

It has been nearly ten days since the Chinese Ministry of Finance implemented the Ma policy. Observing the past ten days, one cannot help but recognize that there has been considerable achievement in some respects, such as the decline in commodity prices, the sharp drop in foreign merchant stocks, and the long position of foreign exchange (the British exchange rate once reached seven pence, and the US exchange rate also reached thirteen yuan six two five). Moreover, the sale of foreign exchange by Japanese merchant banks in the days approaching the end of last month further reflects their inner distress. However, looking at it from another perspective, the method of limiting cash withdrawals still does not escape the nature of "treating the head when it hurts, and the foot when it aches," and is "more than enough to treat the symptoms, but not enough to treat the root cause." Currently, the contraction of legal tender has caused a reactionary decline in the market, but capital flight is not prevented by this, and Chinese merchant banks inevitably pay more than they receive in deposits. Fortunately, the black market for foreign exchange does not have a large supply at all, and foreign banks can also refuse to open new accounts; otherwise, it is very likely to create a situation of driving fish into deep water. Although hoarding of cash is not a great harm unless it involves large sums, waiting for the "storm" to gradually pass, it will be seen that the position of legal tender will still gradually loosen; and the trend of falling commodity prices will not last, and there is even the possibility of rising; it is not unexpected that this will be intensified, creating a higher record. Even regarding the Japanese merchant banks' obtaining foreign exchange, it can indeed be given a considerable blow at present, but in the future, when the position of legal tender is slightly wider, they will inevitably still be active!

Furthermore, speaking of the content of this withdrawal restriction, we have also pointed out the disadvantage of it to industrial and commercial deposits. Apart from the payment of wages, which can be applied to the company for a special withdrawal review committee, there is still no remedy for the rest of the legitimate needs of industry and commerce. If this continues to be handled in the same way as ordinary depositors, industry and commerce will naturally continue to be affected. What should be noted is that the current environment is different from that of August 13th. At that time, it was originally a slack season for industry and commerce, so when the war broke out, the entire city's industry and commerce were at a standstill. Even if you only allow 5% of withdrawals per week, with a maximum amount of 150 yuan, it did not matter much. But what is it like now? First, it is the active season for industry and commerce, and second, it is the appearance of silk, silkworms, beans, and wheat; therefore, in the past ten days, everyone has been expecting supplementary measures, almost like birds waiting to be fed. Although the issuance of a new transfer of 50 million yuan will soon become a reality, it is only an adjustment of chips within the banking industry; even if it has some indirect relationship with industry and commerce, it is very small. Even if another "transfer certificate" can be issued, which can circulate in the market, and at the same time we also assume that its circulation does not hinder the unified national policy of legal tender, it cannot be realized in the short term.

As for the measures for restricting cash withdrawals this time, the financial authorities also said that it is a temporary measure, which can be cancelled after the market stabilizes slightly in the future. In essence, the nature is originally like this; but in our humble opinion, if the National Government authorities have the determination to eliminate the threat to legal tender, the key does not lie in the tightening or loosening of currency; even if it is necessary to focus on currency in order to deal with storms, and to implement currency contraction, it must also be recognized as a tactical strategy. Treating the symptoms is temporary, for emergency; if the effect of the tactical strategy is estimated to be too high, and the period of treating the symptoms is allowed to be too long, then on the one hand, the habit of legal tender hoarding and outflow will become irreversible, and on the other hand, Shanghai's finances will be threatened instead. Because restricting cash withdrawals is not originally a prohibition of cash withdrawals, the result of the accumulation of time and space will make the restriction completely ineffective. This is the inevitable thing in principle, even speaking of the tactical strategy of restricting cash withdrawals itself. It must be known that the current problem still lies in foreign exchange. The morbidity of foreign exchange lies in Shanghai's black market. Without a way to control Shanghai's black market for foreign exchange, how can restricting cash withdrawals in Shanghai be effective; those who evade will still evade, those who speculate will still speculate, and only the general legitimate industrial and commercial operators will be sacrificed. The key lies here, and treating the root cause is very difficult; we should not just talk about high-sounding words, and the authorities cannot succeed empty-handed either; but the authorities' current policy on the black market, at least, still has room for modification depending on the circumstances. For example, for the black market for foreign exchange, under a certain method, adopt an application system, so that the great power is not held upside down. Of course, this method cannot achieve the ideal state of foreign exchange; but it can directly limit the excessive consumption of foreign exchange, and indirectly prevent capital flight and Japanese purchase. It is better to make reality close to the ideal than to have an ideal that cannot dominate reality!

### Amidst Negotiations on the Tianjin Case, the Japanese Army Ministry's Provocative Remarks: "Unless Britain Supports Japan's Goals in China, No Negotiations Can Be Expected to Resolve the Issue; Incidents Similar to the Tianjin Incident Will Continue to Emerge"

(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Ministry stated today that Britain has adopted a hostile policy towards Japan since the Great War. Therefore, in the Tianjin incident, unless Britain changes its policy of hostility towards Japan and supports Japan's goals in China, no resolution can be expected, whether in Tokyo or locally. The spokesman also said that if the Tianjin issue is not resolved, incidents similar to Tianjin will continue to emerge in China. "We cannot forget Britain's attempts to weaken Japan's power, oppose Japan's past actions in 'Manchuria,' and its current actions in China." At the same time, the British side often arbitrarily fabricates news and confuses rumors regarding Japan's current actions in China, deliberately increasing Japan's difficulties. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to distinguish whether the current anti-Japanese propaganda in China is initiated by Chongqing or instigated by the British. According to the spokesman, the current Tianjin incident was also caused by the British. "Since the British continue to expand their assistance to Chongqing, the Japanese army has no choice but to take such measures to thoroughly promote British introspection." As for the British assistance to the Chongqing government in North China, intending to disrupt the peace and economic situation in North China, the facts are countless. The spokesman concluded that Japan's patience has now reached the extreme of unbearable. (30th Associated Press dispatch)

(Tokyo) When answering questions from reporters this morning regarding the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo on the Tianjin incident, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that all military, political, and economic issues related to Tianjin will be included in the talks.

He meant that both sides should have a frank discussion on the situation in Tianjin. (30th Reuters dispatch)

(London) Mr. Chen, a Chinese man from Hong Kong, said here today to the British Imperial Press Union that from the perspective of people in Hong Kong, the Tianjin and Shanghai issues are only a prelude to the Japanese side attacking Hong Kong in the same way.

(30th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers reported that negotiations to resolve the Tianjin British-Japanese dispute are expected to begin here around July 6. The Tianjin dispute will be the subject of negotiations between Tanaka, the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, one Japanese military representative, and Herbert, the British Consul in Tianjin. Tanaka and Herbert are now en route to Beijing to open negotiations. At the same time, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Kato, the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in "Manchuria" representing Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, will discuss fundamental Chinese disputes that have significantly affected British-Japanese relations, resulting in the Tianjin dispute. In this regard, the Asahi Shimbun published an article saying that the Japanese army is determined to win Britain over to revise its basic policy and, based on this policy, abandon its hostile attitude towards Japan and ensure that it actively implements the policy in all of North China. (30th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma met with Army Minister Itagaki and Navy Minister Yonai yesterday to discuss the general demands that the Japanese government intends to put forward when British Ambassador Craigie negotiates the Tianjin incident here. It is understood that the Japanese representatives attending the Tokyo negotiations also include Kato, Counselor of the Embassy in "Manchuria," and Tanaka, the Consul in Tianjin. Kato arrived here yesterday, while Tanaka arrived in Tokyo earlier. (30th Huitong News Agency dispatch)

### Taikoo Company Barge Detained

(Tianjin) The tugboats and barges of the Dagu Towing Company and Taikoo Yanghang are currently being detained by the Japanese side at Xinhe, 30 miles downstream.

When passing Xinhe, a gunshot was heard from the shore, and a White Russian salesman in the Japanese tug was slightly injured by shrapnel. The tugs left the barges at Xinhe and sailed to Tanggu. This morning, two tugs were dispatched from Tanggu to tow the barges downstream, but it was discovered that the barges had been detained by the Japanese side, so they returned in disappointment. A tug of the Kailuan Mining Company towing a coal barge attempted to pass through Xinhe and sail upstream today, but was also forced to turn back. According to news received at 2:30 PM today, the detained barges have not yet been released. (30th Reuters dispatch)

### China Suspends Payment of Principal and Interest on Public Debt; British Newspaper Says It Is Not Surprising

(London) The Financial Times stated in today's editorial that the announcement of the suspension of principal and interest payments on China's 1913 Reorganization Loan and the 1934 Six Percent Loan, if it occurs, is not surprising, as the revenue used to pay the principal and interest is now in the hands of the Japanese. The securities market anticipated the suspension, so the price of the 1913 Reorganization Loan has fallen by sixteen pounds in the past month. The Chinese government has always had a clear reputation for creditworthiness with creditors, but is now suspending payments due to unavoidable circumstances. Most of the customs and salt taxes have now been seized by Japan, and foreign exchange problems have arisen recently, so it is currently difficult to predict whether there will be a way to continue payments.

### The European Crisis Is Imminent Again; British Foreign Secretary Warns Germany to Draw Back from the Brink; If It Continues to Resort to Force, It Will Be Resisted; If It Can Change Course, Cooperation Is Still Possible

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax delivered a very important speech at the Foreign Affairs Association this evening. He said, "The rule of law and order must be preserved and defended, and we must be prepared to fight if necessary. Therefore, if there is any further aggression, we will resolutely fulfill our commitments and resist with all our might." He also stated that Britain would not succumb to slander and force, and that the determination to resist aggression was paramount. To this day, Germany has isolated itself. Economically, it pursues a policy of self-sufficiency; politically, its policies make other countries uneasy; and culturally, it adheres to racial extremism. Because of all this, Germany has reached a state of complete isolation. Whether this situation can be changed depends on the attitude of the German government in the future. If it can change course, a policy of cooperation can be substituted at any time. As far as economic issues are concerned, they cannot be solved by a policy of isolation. This is true for other countries, and it is also true for Germany. It is futile to shout for peace when peace is being lost. If we want to change course and find a solution to the current problems, we must reduce the preparations for war and promise that all countries will have the freedom to enjoy their independence. Otherwise, talking about solutions will be empty words and will not help in reality. British policy is based on two basic goals: one is the determination to resist force, and the other is the recognition that all countries in the world are willing to lay the foundation for peace. If we can be sure that other countries share the same sentiment and have the sincerity to find a peaceful solution, then I can say that all the problems that make the world restless can be submitted for discussion."

### Halifax Statement: Germany Has Isolated Itself; London Is Not Unconcerned About the Insults Suffered by British Nationals in the Far East

(London) British Foreign Secretary Halifax, last night at Chatham House, made clear in a speech Britain's determination to resist future aggression and fulfill its promises with all its might. He said that British policy was based on two major principles: one was the determination to resist force, and the other was the recognition that the world wanted to carry out construction work to create peace. But today, the threat of force makes the world restless, so Britain's current task is to resist aggression. There are things that the British people recognize but that are not fully understood by the people of other countries, such as the fact that if there is another aggression, the British people are determined to immediately exert all their efforts to fulfill their promises to resist aggression. Some countries whose people hold international views that differ from ours often try to distort our actions and motives. We are filled with anger and desire when we read their malicious misunderstandings, knowing that they are false and knowing that those who make these statements also know that their statements are untrue. We do not turn a blind eye to such events, and we are not indifferent to the provocative insults to our people in distant places. I can tell you immediately that Britain is not prepared to succumb to defamation or force. All kinds of provocations against what our people value and are determined to uphold only unite us, increase our determination, and strengthen the ties between us and those who share the same sentiments and desires. A large part of the world has abandoned the old principles of conduct and the norms of humanity. We are all amazed by what they are doing. The rules of conduct between countries are like the rules of conduct between people, regarded as nothing and almost completely destroyed. Since our goals are often misunderstood, we should reiterate them in bold and clear terms. Our first interest is to stop aggression. For this reason, we are in contact with other countries to defend against common dangers. This arrangement has no other intention than defense. Those who say that this is intended to isolate or surround Germany and Italy, and to attempt to prevent these two countries from having the living space necessary for their national existence, what is the truth? Germany is isolating itself economically with its self-sufficiency policy, politically with its policy of constantly conflicting with other countries, and culturally with its racialist ideology, and is far from a completely isolated position. If a person deliberately isolates himself, then the responsibility cannot be blamed on others. If this isolation continues, its inevitable consequences will inevitably become stronger and more obvious. We do not want to see any men, women, or children suffer from exploitation. If this phenomenon exists, it is not our fault. Those who can end this policy of cooperation depend on whether the German government continues to use its own isolation methods.

The Foreign Secretary spoke of "living space," saying, "This policy cannot be solved by getting more land." The only solution is to handle domestic affairs wisely and adjust and improve foreign relations. A country can expand its national wealth and raise its standard of living by gaining the trust of its neighbors. Then, international goods can circulate easily. If a country is determined to destroy the independent existence of its weak neighbors, the result will be counterproductive. As for the so-called "living space," if it means destroying the existence of neighboring countries, then Huang Guo will reject it. Belgium, the Netherlands, and England have all proven that the so-called overpopulation can be prevented by productive work. Economically speaking, the world is closely organized, and no country can hope to harm others and benefit itself. Germany cannot hope to solve its economic problems by isolation. There is plenty of room for cooperation to include the space required for a larger economic life, making it accessible to all countries. As far as Britain is concerned, Britain is prepared to cooperate. If the world is organized according to this outline, then Germany or Italy need not worry about their security. However, this kind of national society cannot be built on force, because people live in fear of violence and have to waste their resources preparing to resist violence. It is useless to shout for peace without peace, and it is useless to talk about solutions without reducing military affairs and acknowledging the protection of national independence. At this time, militarism is blocking the road to a solution and filling the world with a spirit of hostility and harm. But if we abandon militarism and eliminate all war fears in the world, then all pending cases will be easier to resolve, and all countries can discuss political and economic issues, whether international or colonial, in a truly successful atmosphere. Whether it is colonial or other issues, if there are any difficulties, I feel that since all parties have the will to resolve them, they can eventually find a solution. But if the countries do not really want to solve them, then the discussion will do more harm than good. If a responsible spokesperson for a country denounces Britain as a thief and bandit, and spreads words defaming British policy throughout the world every day, how can we negotiate with this government? But if we change this spirit, which is clearly contrary to the will for a peaceful solution, then the British government has never been unprepared to contribute its best advice and adopt the advice of others in order to end the political and economic instability. If we can proceed in this way, then the world will make great progress, and we will be able to restore an atmosphere of mutual trust between countries. After that, the second step will be to rebuild the international order on a broader and more solid foundation. The Foreign Secretary went on to speak of the League of Nations and the Covenant of the League of Nations, saying, "It is an imperfect method to merely prevent the use of force to change the current situation without setting up an agency to promote peaceful change. Today, the countries of Europe are forgetting their common civilization, preparing to kill each other. At this time, we should especially regard Europe as our own, so our foreign policy must always keep the current situation and the future in mind. British policy is based on two points: the determination to resist violence and the recognition of the world's willingness to carry out peaceful work. However, today, the threat of force is making the world restless, so our current task is to resist aggression with all our strength. I dare say that no one can misunderstand us. If we want to dispel all misunderstandings and obtain a solution that the world can trust, then what it is based on must be more practical than verbal responsibilities. There is a saying that what is needed is action, not words. Our view is the same. There must be a practical form of giving and taking on both sides. If you give people real things in exchange for empty promises, then there will never be solid achievements on this basis."

At the beginning of his speech, the Foreign Secretary spoke of Britain's agreements with Poland, Turkey, Greece, and Romania, and said that negotiations with the Soviet Union would soon be successful. He said, "We assume this obligation with a full understanding of its causes and consequences. We know that if the security and independence of other countries are destroyed, then our own security and independence will also be seriously threatened. We also know that if we want to preserve international law and order, then we must be prepared to fight to defend it. Our country's efforts to build up its military are now being strengthened at any time, and all aspects of political administration and industrial life now have this effort, which has the full support of the people. The confirmation that it is being carried out earnestly is because after the military effort, there is a more united British people, with their service, financial resources, and industrial power."

### Germany's Attitude Toward Britain: Doubt or Coercion?

(Berlin) According to an official statement today, the German government will reply to the British government's memorandum on naval issues to Germany within a considerable period of time. The reply will be made through diplomatic channels. It is almost certain that because the British memorandum is highly technical, it cannot be addressed by Hitler's speech. Today, political circles expressed their opinion, saying that if Hitler speaks in Bremen on Saturday, it will not be of great political significance. British Ambassador to Germany Sir Henderson is scheduled to take a week's leave on Tuesday to return home. Germany's reply may not be ready by then. At the same time, according to political officials, there is deep suspicion between Britain and Germany. Germany cannot now believe in Britain's advocacy of reconciliation. Germany is unwilling to speak until Britain changes its policy. (Reuter's Dispatch, 30th)

(Berlin) According to information obtained by Reuters, Hitler is unlikely to go to Bremen tomorrow to attend the launch and ceremony of the new German ship and deliver the speech that everyone expects, as it is believed that he should try to get as much rest as possible before the busy period in the coming autumn, so he will avoid participating in all matters that are not absolutely necessary. According to the German people here, Hitler also realizes that his speech is now valued by the whole world, so he must be extremely cautious about the time and place of publication. It would be difficult for Hitler to deliver a speech at the naval ceremony without mentioning the British naval memorandum. It is said that Hitler is unwilling to anticipate the contents of Germany's formal reply. (Reuter's Dispatch, 30th)

### If a European War Breaks Out, the British Labor World Must Fight for Freedom

(London) Greenwell, the acting leader of the Labor Party in the House of Commons, said in a speech in London last night, "I have heard rumors that war will break out sooner or later. As far as I know, if war does break out, the British Labor Party must resolutely respond. I have never thought that I would use these words, but life is precious, and there is something greater than life: freedom." (Reuter's Dispatch, 30th)

### Halifax's Remarks Are Highly Valued by All Countries; The Most Important Speech Since 1914; German and Italian Newspapers Call It Old Hat

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech has declared to Germany Britain's determination to participate in war at any time to resist aggression. Political figures here expressed their approval after hearing about it. It is reported that the speech had been approved by Prime Minister Chamberlain in advance. Because this afternoon, shocking news was received here about the free city of Danzig, and it was learned that the city's parliament would formally announce its merger into the German territory. If Poland intervenes, Germany will regard it as an act of aggression, and war will begin from this. Foreign Secretary Halifax gave this speech to express Britain's position. His speech was also translated into various languages and broadcast to the world, so that everyone could hear it. Among conservative figures, it is advocated that the government should immediately establish a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet government to strengthen the anti-aggression front and make all aggressors retreat in the face of difficulties. In addition, the economic talks conducted by the Ministry of Finance with the Polish economic delegation also have the potential to quickly conclude an agreement, allowing Britain to lend a large sum of money to Poland to help it expand its military equipment. (Havas Dispatch, 29th)

(London) The British newspapers in London today published British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech in large letters, believing that it represented correct public opinion. The Daily Guide's diplomatic correspondent called the speech "the most serious speech by a British cabinet member since 1914." The Daily Telegraph called Halifax a diplomatic reformer, like Martin Luther of the church. The Daily Express said that Halifax's speech represented the public opinion of the people. (Haitong Dispatch, 30th)

(Paris) The newspapers here today reported that British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech has removed the doubts of the general public about British policy, analyzing that Berlin and Rome should know the valuable results of non-aggression. Polish President Mosicki and German leaders now know that if Poland or Danzig suffers a direct or disguised attack, then this is not a simple local event. The People's Newspaper said that the British Foreign Secretary has expressed a great and beautiful pacifism in respecting the law and international cooperation. We hope that the German people can understand this speech and pay attention to its warning. (Reuter's Dispatch, 30th)

(Berlin) A German government spokesman today criticized British Foreign Secretary Halifax's constant remarks, saying that it would be better if Britain did not repeatedly reiterate its non-aggression and unwillingness to surround Germany. This is because the remarks only make Germany more suspicious. It is childish to think that Britain's constant reiteration of these promises can convince Germany. The German people have a very clear impression of Britain's policy. Germany is not engaged in war preparations, but Britain is giving Poland a blank check and making these preparations. According to the German official opinion, Halifax's speech did not contain new elements. (Reuter's Dispatch, 30th)

(Berlin) The German News Agency, which has close ties with the German Foreign Ministry, strongly criticized British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech, saying that most of it was directed at Germany, and was obviously caused by the alarming news about Danzig published in the newspapers of Britain and France. What Berlin is most indignant about is that Halifax still said that Britain is pursuing a policy of peace, but in fact, none of London's recent measures are a manifestation of preparing for war. (Haitong Dispatch, 30th)

(Berlin) After British Foreign Secretary Halifax delivered his speech last night, the newspapers in Berlin attacked it. The Financial Times declared that the propaganda campaign promoted by British cabinet members had two mistakes: (1) They believed that repeating constant remarks with insufficient reasons could strengthen their country's power; (2) They underestimated the common sense and observation ability of foreign people, thinking that they could cover up the eyes and ears of the world. In fact, Halifax's speech was just a repetition of old words. In a word, it still tried to achieve the consistent British policy of balance of power. The German General Bulletin declared that it was a mistake to say that Germany was isolated. Germany was never isolated, and it maintained good land friendship with neutral neighbors. Even the countries that Britain had forced to guarantee them in the dangerous zone recognized Germany's interests related to their survival. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 30th)

(Rome) This morning, all newspapers carried excerpts from British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech, which the Roman People's Newspaper called grand and lacking in constructiveness, saying that his words were spicy and contained threats, but not as diplomatic as the speech delivered by Churchill the day before. It also said that the British people had failed to realize that the wealthy Britain was now in an inevitable decline. (Reuter's Dispatch, 30th)

### Germany's Determination to Acquire Danzig: Increasingly Overt Tactics; Conflicting Rumors of German Military Deployment; Mussolini Advocates Prudence

(Berlin) According to the most reliable sources, the Associated Press reporter stated that the Danzig issue is unlikely to worsen in the coming weeks. However, the German side will continue to plan to annex the Free City into Germany. A Paris telegram reported that Germany would deploy troops to seize Danzig at the end of this week, but this is unlikely to materialize. (Associated Press, 30th)

(Berlin) Two shocking pieces of news are circulating here: (1) Army officers and most military assistants and soldiers have had their leave cancelled since the end of July; (2) Certain ranks of conscripted soldiers whose service period expires at the end of August will not be discharged but will be required to remain in the camp until the end of September. (Havas, 29th)

Warsaw: According to semi-official news from Danzig today, military supplies and troops have been continuously transported from East Prussia to Danzig in recent days. Yesterday, sixteen artillery pieces were unloaded in a bay east of Danzig and transferred by fishing boats to Bischofsberg. The Danzig authorities are now rushing to build steel-reinforced concrete gun emplacements on the mountain there, with police and stormtroopers guarding the perimeter, prohibiting people from climbing the mountain. The barracks on the mountain have been converted into an armory. It is reported that hundreds of stormtroopers have arrived in Danzig from East Prussia to provide military service to members of the National Socialist Party organization. They are currently living in pre-war underground fortresses. (Reuters, 30th)

Warsaw: The German National Socialist Party's organization of volunteer corps in the Free City of Danzig has recently been exposed by various newspapers here. It is reported that yesterday, four artillery pieces were transported by waterway to Danzig and hauled up the Pischkenberg mountain by thirty-two horses, after which anyone was strictly prohibited from climbing the mountain. In addition, the city authorities are employing 3,000 workers to rush the construction of barracks to house the members of the volunteer corps. These members are German youths, aged between nineteen and twenty-three, who have come from the province of East Prussia. The city authorities have also ordered 4,000 sets of uniforms and 4,000 pairs of leather boots from clothing stores and shoe shops within the territory. The required wool and leather are all supplied by the National Socialist Party. The Warsaw Evening News reported that the German side now has two options: one is violent action, and the other is to threaten with war. The latter is more likely, but it is still sufficient to cause a crisis. As for the Danzig authorities, they are also preparing for the mobilization of residents. Among all the phenomena, one point deserves attention: before Germany took action to annex Austria and Czechoslovakia, all preparations were extremely secret; now, in Danzig, there is no attempt to conceal anything. Inferring from this, this is also a strategy, intending to make Poland anxious. (Havas, 30th)

(Berlin) Official circles here today vigorously denied that German troops or other personnel have entered Danzig, or that irregular troops are being organized. However, they admitted that Danzig is now strengthening its peaceful forces within legal limits, and only using Danzig citizens. They also said that this is due to the rash and irresponsible behavior of Polish officials in the corridor. An unofficial source in Danzig reported that big events are underway there, and the situation is gradually deteriorating. The rumors of German military deployment are still as usual, and cannot be verified. (Reuters, 30th)

(Rome) Mussolini and Hitler secretly conferred last Sunday. Political circles are now refusing to discuss this matter, and Roman newspapers have not published anything about it. Only a limited number of political figures are aware of this news. Political circles are highly suspicious of this meeting. If it did indeed take place, it must have been initiated by Mussolini, in the hope of advising Hitler not to be too hasty on the Danzig issue. All newspapers here with a peaceful inclination believe that Mussolini will not take straightforward and irreversible steps, thereby plunging Italy into war. This hope has never wavered. Although the general public views Danzig as the main point of contention today, they do not believe that it will threaten the common interests of Italy and Germany, or threaten the security and vital interests of either country. However, after visits between the army, navy, and air force authorities of the two countries, everything must have been agreed upon, so that the army, navy, and air force of the two countries can become a single unit in wartime.

### British and French Ambassadors to Poland Return Home for Consultation

(London) The British Ambassador to Poland, Kennard, returned to London by plane tonight. This trip has no special significance and is merely fulfilling a pre-arranged vacation. (Reuters, 30th)

(Paris) The French Ambassador to Poland, Noël, has returned to Paris for a short visit and paid a visit to Foreign Minister Bonnet today. (Reuters, 30th)

### Roosevelt and Hull Confer on International Situation; Soviet Ambassador to the US to Return Home for Consultation, Meets with Hull for Lengthy and Significant Talks

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull had dinner with President Roosevelt at the White House today, reporting to the President on the latest information from overseas, the most important of which concerned the overall situation in China and Danzig. Before dinner, Hull met with the Soviet Ambassador to the US, Oumansky, who will be returning to Moscow for vacation. The length of their meeting was unprecedented. (Reuters, 29th)

(Washington) The Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Oumansky, paid a special visit to Secretary of State Hull this morning. Observers believe that it will have a significant impact on US-Soviet relations. According to the Soviet Ambassador, this visit was merely to express goodwill and to say farewell, as the Ambassador will be returning home for a two-month vacation starting next Wednesday. However, the two spoke for as long as fifty minutes, so the nature must be very important. According to external reports, the Soviet Ambassador and Hull not only discussed the recent changes in Europe, but also focused on the Far East issue. It is also said that Oumansky's purpose was to inquire whether the United States' policy towards the East would continue. It is said that Hull replied that if the US and the Soviet Union could cooperate diplomatically, they would be able to stop any acts of aggression. (Associated Press, 30th)

### Soviet Parliamentarian Criticizes the Attitude of Britain and France

(Moscow) Soviet Supreme Soviet member Zhdanov recently published an article in Pravda, stating that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to conclude a mutual assistance pact have reached a deadlock. Although the Soviet government's position is very clear and it will do its utmost to promote the early signing of a mutual assistance pact, there has been no progress in the negotiations to date. Under the current international situation, this fact is of course extremely important. From this, aggressors and all enemies of peace will devote more effort to undermining the establishment of an anti-aggression agreement among democratic countries and further expand their acts of aggression. This negotiation, which is anticipated by all peace-loving countries and peoples, is now so delayed. What is the reason? I will now express my personal opinion. People have hitherto believed that the British and French governments were truly sincere in establishing a European anti-aggression bulwark when negotiating a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union. However, I believe that the British and French governments are actually unwilling to conclude an equal treaty with the Soviet Union, that is, any treaty that a self-respecting country can agree to. This point is precisely the reason for the deadlock in the negotiations. I will try to prove this with facts. What are the facts? First of all, the so-called British-Soviet negotiations, in the proper sense, have been underway for seventy-five days from the time we received the first British proposal on April 15 to the present. During this period, the Soviet government spent only sixteen days preparing replies to the British proposals and suggestions, while the British and French governments spent fifty-nine days on delays and discussions. Does this fact not prove that the responsibility for the slowness of the negotiations should be borne by the British and French sides? Furthermore, past experience in concluding international agreements similar to those currently being negotiated by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union proves that Britain only needed a very short period to establish mutual assistance agreements with Turkey and Poland. This proves that if there is a genuine desire to sign a treaty, Britain can proceed with the necessary speed. The British and French governments' extremely tolerant delays and endless discussions during the negotiations with the Soviet Union are sufficient to make us suspect the true intentions of Britain and France, and force us to raise the following question: what is the basis of this policy? Is it truly intended to safeguard the peace front, or is it merely to use the negotiations and the delay of the negotiations to achieve other goals that have nothing in common with the establishment of a front of peace-loving countries? The British and French governments have repeatedly raised various artificial difficulties in the negotiations. Among the issues that Britain and France could have quickly resolved if they were sincere, it seems that there are serious differences of opinion between Britain and France and the Soviet Union. This fact further deepens the above question. For example, the joint guarantee by the three parties that Latvia, Estonia, and Finland would receive immediate assistance if their neutrality was violated by aggressors is one of the artificial "obstacles" in the negotiations. It is claimed that the aforementioned Baltic countries are unwilling to accept this guarantee, and this is the reason why Britain and France cannot accept the Soviet proposal. In fact, this is clearly not a problem, and it is only brought up for the sole purpose of hindering the progress of the negotiations and thereby undermining them. In short, the facts we know are sufficient to prove that when Britain believes that safeguarding a certain country is in its own interests, it can find normal methods to achieve its goal without waiting for the country to ask for protection. For example, the British Sunday Times reported on June 4 this year: "Poland has agreed that when Britain is drawn into war due to the invasion of Holland, it will send troops to help Britain, and Britain has agreed that when Poland is drawn into war due to the invasion of Danzig or Lithuania, it will also provide Poland with assistance." In this way, Poland and Britain have simultaneously given guarantees to Lithuania and Holland. I do not know whether the opinions of Lithuania and Holland have been consulted regarding this double guarantee, but the newspapers have never carried this news. Furthermore, as far as I know, Holland and Lithuania have both denied the existence of such a guarantee. However, the Sunday Times claimed that the treaty guaranteeing the two countries has been signed, and this news has not been denied by any party. Not long ago, Polish Foreign Minister Beck, in a conversation with a French reporter, stated definitively, among other things, that Poland does not request or solicit any guarantee from the Soviet Union and is completely satisfied with this fact. The above points prove that although Britain and France constantly swear to uphold "equality," they are actually unwilling to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union based on the principle of equality and reciprocity. What they want is a treaty in which the Soviet Union alone bears all the obligations. Of course, any self-respecting country that does not want to "pull chestnuts out of the fire for others" cannot agree to this kind of treaty, and the Soviet Union, whose reputation is already known throughout the world, cannot agree to it either. In my view, Britain and France seem to have no intention of signing an acceptable treaty with the Soviet Union, and are only talking about the so-called treaty in order to speculate on the exaggerated attitude of the Soviet Union in their own domestic public opinion. To be frank, the developments of recent days will be able to prove whether this is true. (TASS, 29th)

### Guangdong Military Authorities Establish Guerrilla Zone Command Post: Unifying Command, Dispatch, and Other Powers and Responsibilities; Significant Results Achieved Since the Launch of Guerrilla Warfare

Shaoguan Correspondence: The strength of the Guangdong Province guerrilla forces is growing daily. The ×th War Zone Command Headquarters is consolidating guerrilla forces in various places to promote the power of guerrilla warfare. For those guerrillas with a shallow understanding of politics, special improvements are being made. The specific measures are: (A) Current guerrilla members will be given a qualitative screening, the names and command powers of the guerrilla forces will be strictly defined, and any self-organized combinations will be banned to avoid disturbing the people and affecting their faith in the country and the spirit of cooperation between the military and the people. (B) Each district guerrilla command headquarters will immediately establish cadre training classes to strictly implement training in order to cultivate good cadres and assign them to various departments to undertake basic work, so as to instill political understanding in each member. In the future, newly recruited members must undergo strict training to enrich their national and ethnic ideology in order to strengthen their will. The ×th War Zone Command Headquarters, together with the headquarters of the ×× Group Army, has compiled "The Essentials of Guerrilla Warfare" and distributed it to each district guerrilla command headquarters for compliance, striving to exert the most effective strategy to realize the purpose and mission of guerrilla warfare. After this reorganization, the guerrilla forces in each department are more determined, and the strategy and tactics in combat have become more flexible. Regarding the powers and responsibilities of unified command and dispatch of guerrilla forces, the ×th War Zone Command Headquarters has recently established a guerrilla zone command post, and Xiang Hanping, Deputy Commander of the ×× Group Army, has been appointed as the director of the post. After receiving the order, Xiang went to inspect Huizhou, Yangbo, Dongguan, Baoan, and other counties in eastern Guangdong, inspected the local situation, and established the post in a certain place in eastern Guangdong to command the guerrilla forces in all parts of the province. The organization of the post, under the director, is divided into staff, adjutant, secretary, and manager, as well as a training and political office. The chiefs of each department were also appointed at the same time. Zhang Wen is the chief of staff, Lin Zhuliang is the adjutant, Deng Tan is the secretary, and Wang Xianting is the manager. The director of the political training office is being selected by the Military Affairs Commission. In addition, Xiong Lue was hired as a senior advisor. The guerrilla commanders of each war zone of the ×th War Zone have also been reappointed. The commander of the first district is Lu Ling, whose jurisdiction covers Nanhai, Sanshui, and Huaxian. The second district is Wu Guanqi, whose jurisdiction covers Panyu, Conghua, Zengcheng, and other counties. The third district is Luo Fengxiang, whose jurisdiction covers Huiyang, Boluo, Zijin, Heyuan, and other counties. The fourth district is Wang Ruozhou, whose jurisdiction covers Dongguan, Baoan, and other counties. The fifth district is Ma Shaoping, whose jurisdiction covers Xinhui, Kaiping, Heshan, Chixi, Enping, Taishan, and other counties. The sixth district is Wu Fei, whose jurisdiction covers Zhongshan County. Since the launch of large-scale guerrilla warfare, the guerrilla forces have achieved great results. The guerrilla war records of each county are recorded separately as follows:

Nanhai

The Nanhai and Sanshui area guerrilla forces, at about 8:00 p.m. on the 6th, sneaked to the section between Shizishan and Xiaotang, secretly dug up fifteen pairs of Guangsan Railway tracks, and disguised wooden tracks on the roadbed to conceal the Japanese military's movements. On the morning of the 7th, a train carrying military supplies to supply the Japanese army in Sanshui drove eastward from the southwest and returned to Foshan, carrying a small team of thirty people. At 7:00 a.m., it drove to the wooden track section between Xiaotang and Shizishan. Unable to withstand the pressure, it crashed loudly, and the train derailed and overturned. The Japanese soldiers in the carriage could not escape and were crushed to death. At about 8:00 a.m., the Japanese soldiers in Foshan heard the news and sent more than thirty engineers in a car to Xiaotang to rescue and transport the wounded and killed Japanese soldiers back to Foshan for treatment. They also vented their anger on the villagers. On the same day, they sent more than a hundred Japanese soldiers to Shishan, claiming that the villagers had destroyed the tracks. They ignored everything and opened fire on anyone they saw, and set fire to more than twenty civilian houses in the village before retreating at 2:00 p.m.

Panyu

The guerrilla forces in Panyu County constantly launch surprise attacks on the Japanese army. The Japanese army constantly uses the Shixin Road (from Shiqiao to Xinzhao) and Xinshi Road (from Xinzhao to Shilou) highways for military transport. The guerrilla forces have been constantly sabotaging these roads in the past week. The Japanese army repairs and sabotages them repeatedly, making it impossible to maintain them, and is extremely angry. From the 12th, they specially sent more than a hundred Japanese soldiers to patrol and guard the two roads all day long. However, the guerrilla forces appear and disappear frequently, and the Japanese army cannot stop them. On the 15th, they burned down the Xinzhao Road railway station and killed two Japanese special police officers. Also, at noon on the 12th, a Japanese wooden boat was searching for a large amount of food in various villages and was sailing through Dongpu. The guerrilla forces of Li Datong's unit detected it, disguised as fishermen, driving five small boats on the sea, fishing. Several earth cannons were ambushed on the shore. When the Japanese boat arrived, they suddenly jumped onto the Japanese boat, first killing fifteen Japanese soldiers, and then capturing the boat and driving it to a certain place, where all the rice and grain were unloaded. At about 3:00 a.m., the Japanese side realized it and sent five electric boats to search, but the guerrilla forces had already safely withdrawn. It was not until that evening that the Japanese soldiers, seeing no clues, left in frustration. In addition, the Japanese army is extremely fearful because the guerrilla forces launch surprise attacks from time to time. Recently, they forced the Panyu puppet county government to be responsible for suppressing them. After receiving the order, the puppet county government forcibly pulled people from various villages to organize so-called commando teams. However, most of the people are very aware of the righteousness and are unwilling to be used by the Japanese side. Therefore, the county magistrate sent the puppet security chief on the 9th to lure the village chiefs of the Shitou and Xixu villages to conscript strong men. The villagers of Shitou Village, Chen Jian and Gao Laochao, were outraged and shot the chief to death on the way. The two Japanese soldiers who were protecting him were also killed. The people were very happy.

Shunde

At about 10:00 a.m. on the 10th, Peng, the chairman of the puppet maintenance association of Rongqi Wufang, was drinking tea and reading the newspaper at the Yichang Tea House on the upper street market. He was shot dead by the guerrilla forces on the way home, and Peng's head was chopped off, placed in a bamboo basket, and taken back to the guerrilla headquarters to receive a reward. Afterwards, Peng's henchmen ran to report to the Japanese army in Rongqi. The Japanese army commander, Harada, arrived at the scene to inspect and blamed Peng's accomplices, saying, "Why didn't you resist? You are useless." He laughed and left. Since this incident, the Rongqi puppets have been living in fear all day long.

Dongguan

The Ye Tieliang unit guerrilla force, which is active on the Wanzhang Highway (Luozhen to Zhangmutou), attacked the puppet maintenance association in front of the Wancheng County Government on the night of the 10th. More than a hundred members of the team first broke through the main gate of the county government at about 11:00 p.m. At that time, the puppet self-defense team was suddenly attacked and urgently telegraphed the Japanese army headquarters at Mingsheng Middle School for assistance. However, the guerrilla members had been prepared and had surrounded the Japanese camp beforehand. When the Japanese army rushed in, they blocked the key points and prevented them from advancing and attacking a part of the puppet maintenance association, so they were able to proceed smoothly, rushing into the association and killing more than twenty puppet self-defense team members and puppet maintenance association officials. They also found important documents on the bodies of the two puppets, Li and Chen, and seized the puppet self-defense team leader's short and long guns and remaining poles. Also, Lun, a wealthy merchant in Shilong Town, was very successful in distributing medicines for an agency Western pharmacy. When the Japanese planes bombed Sanshilong last year, he had moved his family to Hong Kong. Later, he returned from Hong Kong. At that time, the Japanese army lured various offices in Shilong to organize a puppet autonomous maintenance association and instructed the association to elect Lun as the puppet chairman. However, Lun excused himself, saying that he had private affairs in Hong Kong and needed to clear them up before returning to Shilong to take up the puppet position. The Japanese army approved this. This matter was detected by the guerrilla force, so they sent a team to lie in ambush on the way. When Lun was traveling from Shilong to Hong Kong and arrived at Pinghu Station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, they suddenly arrested Lun and found a lot of Hong Kong dollars on his body. He was taken to the Huizhou headquarters. During the court hearing, Lun requested that the matter be investigated and handled. It is said that the headquarters has executed Lun by firing squad.

They forcibly seized pedestrians, regardless of class. At that time, the people were in great panic and fled in droves. The shops were also closed and the market was suspended, and the order was greatly disrupted for a time.

### Semiannual Settlement of Silver and Banking Businesses: All Expected to Obtain Considerable Profits; Financial Market Stable and All Businesses Passing Through Peacefully; Banking Business Association Convenes Meeting to Publicly Decide Interbank Lending Rate

Yesterday marked the end of June, the semiannual settlement period for silver and banking businesses. The financial market remained stable, and all businesses passed through peacefully. Today will be the start of a three-day holiday, with business operations resuming on the 4th. The Banking Business Association convened a meeting and publicly decided on the interbank lending rate. All firms are expected to obtain considerable profits. Detailed information is recorded below:

Semiannual Settlement Announcement by Silver and Banking Businesses

The Shanghai Banking Association and the Silver Business Association jointly announced yesterday: "It is hereby announced that the banking and money businesses' semiannual settlement holiday falls on July 1st and 2nd. However, since the 2nd is a regular Sunday holiday, in accordance with regulations, an additional day should be added the following day. Therefore, all banks and money businesses under these two associations will be closed for three days, from July 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. This announcement is made for public awareness." All banks and firms are permitted to resume business operations starting July 4th. However, although outwardly closed from July 1st to 3rd, internally, depending on the business of each bank and firm, normal office work will continue to process semiannual settlement matters.

Regular Meeting of Silver Business Association Members

The Silver Business Association held its 45th regular meeting of member representatives of the third session on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 2 PM. Representatives from over forty firms, including Fuyuan, Shunkang, Baofeng, Tongrun, and Yida, such as Lu Shuchen, Shen Jingliang, Yan Dayou, and Zhang Wenbo, attended. Zhang Yezhou chaired the meeting, with Secretary Ge Huaiqing taking minutes. They resolved that the interbank lending rate for June would be 5 yuan and 5 jiao. In addition, five measures, including interest rates for receiving and remitting funds, and methods for exchanging centralized check clearing into legal tender, were discussed.

Silver Businesses Pass Resolution to Handle Settlement

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned that silver businesses typically handle settlement at the end of the lunar year. Their long-term credit loans are due at the end of April and October. Therefore, whenever banks handle their semiannual settlement, silver businesses continue to operate as usual. The Silver Business Joint Reserve also operates as usual. Consequently, the Silver Business Association's holiday schedule does not include holiday provisions. However, this year, after approval by the association, they will jointly handle the semiannual settlement with the banking industry. Therefore, a joint announcement has been issued with the Banking Association to handle the semiannual settlement.

Financial Market Remains Stable

Although yesterday was the end of June, the day for silver and banking businesses to handle settlements, the Shanghai financial market, since the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram restricting withdrawals, has remained as stable as ever. The interbank lending rate in the silver market, on the contrary, has decreased from 1 jiao 2 fen to 2 jiao. The various discount rates of the Four Banks Discount Meeting and the Bank Reserve have not changed. However, the check clearing house, to facilitate check collection and settlement for its members, has specifically extended the check clearing time, stipulating that it will begin at 4:45 PM. As for the time for collecting checks, it remains the same as before.

Bank Profits, All Businesses Pass Through Peacefully

Furthermore, according to inquiries made by reporters from the New Voice to various industries, various businesses within the Shanghai Concession have experienced abnormal growth due to increased population and surging demand after the war. All had surpluses during this Dragon Boat Festival settlement. Therefore, loans from various banks due at the end of June were all recovered as scheduled. As a result of the semiannual settlement, they were able to obtain considerable profits. No unfortunate events occurred in the market. The situation was better than before the war, and all industries reported peacefully passing through. This is truly due to the government's and banks' regulatory efforts.

### Eastern Zhejiang Mail Transferred Via Jinjiang; Remittances Normal, Still No Restrictions; Insured Mail to Fujian Temporarily Suspended

Mail from Shanghai to Eastern Zhejiang and various cities and counties along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line is a concern for Zhejiang residents in Shanghai due to the interruption of shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday to the Transportation Division of the Shanghai Postal Administration, regarding Eastern Zhejiang mail, in addition to the temporary suspension of accepting parcels and heavy items, ordinary, registered, and express mail is now being routed through Jinjiang, Fujian. Therefore, mail delivery between Shanghai and Zhejiang will not be delayed as a result of this. However, the time will be slightly longer. Remittances are still processed normally, and remittances can be made without restrictions. Regarding insured mail to various locations in the Fujian postal area, the Postal Administration has decided to temporarily suspend accepting it starting today due to recent bombings and instability in Fujian. However, Xiamen is an exception and can still accept insured mail as usual. A formal announcement will be issued to inform the public. It was also learned that since the resumption of postal services in Jiujiang, the Jiujiang First-Class Post Office's Shanghai office would have some key personnel leave Shanghai for Jiujiang. Now, due to the development of postal affairs in Jiujiang, the postal staff is unable to cope. Therefore, the Shanghai office will be closed, and over twenty postal workers will be recalled to Jiujiang to take on important tasks.

### U.S. Warship Carrying Army Troops to Qinhuangdao for Summer Training

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reports that the U.S. Navy transport ship USS Henderson is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at noon on Sunday, carrying replacement troops. Two detachments of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai will depart on the ship on Monday morning at 11:00 AM, bound for Qinhuangdao for summer training. After these two detachments leave Shanghai, the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai will have only about 500 personnel remaining. However, the two detachments of the U.S. Marine Corps that went to Qinhuangdao last month aboard the USS Chaumont will return to Shanghai on the USS Henderson. It is expected that the ship will dock for ten days upon its second arrival in Shanghai before carrying Marine Corps and Navy personnel whose Far East service has expired back to the United States.

### Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Stirling Fessenden, Retires; Having Served as Secretary-General for Over a Decade, He Is Respected by the Citizens; The Council Deeply Appreciates His Service

Mr. Stirling Fessenden, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, retired at the end of June this year upon completion of his term. During the Council meeting on June 28th, Chairman Mr. Fessenden addressed the Council, stating roughly that today was the last meeting of the Council members and Secretary-General Fessenden. The Vice-Chairman of the Council had previously expressed the regret of all Council members at a farewell banquet. He now wished to reiterate to Mr. Fessenden that the Council deeply appreciated his service. Mr. Fessenden had served as Secretary-General since 1927, during which time his contributions were remarkable. The residents of this city universally respected him. Mr. Fessenden's retirement was undoubtedly a loss to the Council. However, on a personal level, it was a gain, as Mr. Fessenden would be cooperating with him in the practice of law, etc. The Council members unanimously applauded in farewell.

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reports that Mr. Stirling Fessenden, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, left his office for the last time as an employee of the Council this afternoon (the 30th), marking the end of many years of service. But his advice is still available. When interviewed by reporters this morning, Mr. Fessenden stated that he had no different feelings and nothing special to report. He also mentioned that he had no intention of leaving Shanghai but wished to rest. In a few months, he may travel to the Pacific coast of the United States. It is noted that Mr. Fessenden is not retiring but will return to practicing law.

### Interbank Clearing System Scheduled to Begin on the 4th; Transfers to the Interior Immediately Payable in Cash; Ministry of Finance Has Telegraphed Approval to Proceed

Since the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram implementing restrictions on withdrawals, due to its nature aimed at cracking down on those speculating in foreign exchange in Shanghai, the banking and silver industries have, based on the Ma telegram, negotiated seven measures to vigorously safeguard legitimate commerce while suppressing foreign exchange speculation. A reporter from this newspaper learned from financial circles that the banking and silver associations have telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to report the agreed-upon seven measures and the negotiated interbank clearing system. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has recently telegraphed a reply, stating that regarding the adjustment of legal tender funds, the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications have been instructed to handle it as appropriate. The other points have also been approved. As for the issue of clearing surcharges, which everyone is concerned about, according to news from the Banking Association, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee has negotiated to exchange the original clearing deposits for legal tender in installments. Therefore, after July 4th, clearing surcharges will naturally tend to disappear. At the same time, the new interbank clearing system will be implemented, hoping to provide foreign banks with reliable connections for these clearing notes. From now on, industrial and commercial enterprises can use this clearing system to transfer funds to various banks for the purchase of raw materials in the interior, and interior banks will pay in cash. According to financial circles, this measure has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and has been relayed to various banks for implementation. Therefore, the issue of remittances to the interior for purchasing goods, which the market has been concerned about recently, has been properly resolved. Yesterday, financial circles also relayed that the Ministry of Finance would make a statement on the clearing portion at the beginning of the month. This statement could not be confirmed by reporters last night when inquiring with authoritative sources in the banking industry. It was said that, as of now, nothing had been heard. It is expected that the Ministry of Finance has now approved and filed the various measures recently formulated by the Shanghai silver and banking industries after restricting withdrawals. Now that Shanghai's finance is stable, the measures to stabilize finance have come to an end.

Withdrawal Registration

The Bank Joint Reserve Committee is handling interbank withdrawals and clearings, with the total amount provisionally set at 50 million national currency. It is scheduled to be implemented starting July 4th after handling withdrawals and clearings. All banks and firms can provide property as collateral to withdraw funds from the committee. After the committee assesses the value of the property provided by each bank and firm, it will be included in the clearing current account and a checkbook will be issued for withdrawals. The checks issued from this checkbook will be paid by the Bank Reserve. This check is the interbank clearing. Anyone holding this interbank clearing can exchange it for a clearing certificate from the Bank Reserve.

Foreign Merchants Agree

Regarding foreign banks accepting clearing notes, after consultations between the Banking Association and the Foreign Banks Association, the foreign banks have expressed their agreement in principle with the interbank clearing system and have agreed that interbank clearings can be used as collateral for overdrafts. The specific measures are still being negotiated, and they have agreed to send representatives to participate in the Shanghai Banking and Silver Industry Interbank Clearing Reserve Inspection Committee. Therefore, after the clearing note system is improved, it can be widely circulated in the market. Therefore, its circulation effect is no different from cash, which is sufficient to supply the capital needs of the city's industry and commerce.

Establish Assessment Committee

In order to assess the value of the collateral provided by each bank and firm for the interbank clearing, the Bank Reserve Committee has decided to hire experts to form an assessment committee, divided into: Real Estate Section, Securities and Stock Section, and Goods Section. Each section will have a chairman and several executive members. An Interbank Clearing Reserve Inspection Committee will also be established, with five members. It will be announced after each group nominates members. It will then be established. It will then hold at least one inspection per month and announce the amount withdrawn and the types and amounts of collateral separately.

Transfer to the Interior

Interbank clearings can be transferred to the interior for purchasing local goods. This is stipulated in Article 12 of the Bank Joint Reserve Committee's Interbank Withdrawal Method. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency to the banking industry, all factories and firms in Shanghai that need local raw materials and want to purchase them in the interior previously required cash. From now on, they can use this clearing to transfer funds to banks in the interior, which is completely the same as legal tender. Therefore, in the future, those holding clearings will no longer need to apply for discounts from small money shops, so clearing surcharges are certain to disappear automatically. If they cannot be completely eliminated, they will definitely not be as rampant as in the past.

Exchange for Legal Tender

In order to centralize the original clearing deposits of various banks and firms in the Bank Reserve Committee and the Silver Business Reserve, it has been decided to exchange them for legal tender at 95 percent over twelve weeks after the semiannual settlement. The legal tender will be provided by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank. Therefore, in the future, in addition to increasing the number of new clearing funds with reliable collateral, the market will also increase the number of legal tender funds by 20 million yuan. At the same time, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee will announce the interest rate of interbank clearing and the interest rate of clearing deposits daily. As for the widespread circulation of clearing notes, clearing surcharges may disappear automatically.

### Japanese Warships Concentrated off the Coast of Fujian and Zhejiang; Oujiang and Mawei on Alert; If Necessary, Continue to Block the Blockade Line; Ningbo Peaceful, Reports of Battle at Zhenhai Inaccurate

Due to the Japanese Navy's attempted landings in recent days, the situation along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian has suddenly become tense. The gap in the Zhenhai blockade line, after the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters Commander-in-Chief General Liu telegraphed to sink the old Taiping wheel on the evening of the 28th to formally block it, the German merchant ship Moufu wheel, which was sailing to Ningbo, was unable to enter the port and temporarily anchored outside the blockade line. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Daguan News Agency to the Lihe Foreign Firm, the ship was still anchored outside the port yesterday and will discharge passengers and goods into the port there before returning directly to Shanghai. As for whether the Taiping wheel had actually sunk, no telegrams had been received as of 7:00 PM yesterday.

Preparing to Blockade the Coast of Zhejiang and Fujian

The New Voice News Agency has learned from the shipping industry that since the Japanese army forcibly occupied the Zhoushan Islands and attempted to land in Kanmen, Yuhuan County, Zhejiang, and Chuanshi Island, Fuzhou, Fujian, the situation along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian has become tense. The military authorities of Zhejiang and Fujian have ordered the garrisons to be on strict alert in order to strengthen coastal defenses. In addition to blocking the gap in the Zhenhai blockade line in Ningbo, the gaps in the Oujiang River in Wenzhou and the Mawei blockade line in Fuzhou will be blocked if necessary.

Concentration of Japanese Warships, Intentions Unclear

Three Japanese warships are cruising outside the mouth of the Oujiang River in Wenzhou, and there have been no unusual movements. Japanese warships frequently come and go off the coast of Yueqing. In addition to passing through without stopping, there are currently nine Japanese warships anchored. Near Yanpan and Wengyang, there are also more than ten small motorboats and more than twenty captured civilian ships, seemingly with the intention of landing. Off Guanyin Mountain in Yuhuan, there is one Japanese-type warship anchored. In the waters off Chawu and Shengbei, there are more than ten Japanese warships of various sizes, with unclear intentions. Off Chuanshi in Fujian, there are currently three Japanese warships anchored, with unclear intentions.

Reports of Shelling at Zhenhai Inaccurate

Yesterday afternoon, it was widely rumored in the city that fierce shelling had occurred outside Zhenhai, and that the news had been telegraphed to Shanghai by the Moufu wheel. However, according to inquiries made by reporters to the Lihe Foreign Firm, the firm stated that it had not received any telegrams of shelling, so it considered the news to be inaccurate. Reporters inquired with the Zhongyi Company and was also informed that no reports had been received. However, Ningbo was learned to be peaceful, so the rumors were clearly not true.

Japanese Aircraft Bombing Fuzhou and Wenzhou

According to telegrams received by the shipping industry: Three Japanese aircraft invaded and bombed Wenzhou at around 9:00 AM on the 29th, and dropped five or six bombs in Yueqing, with unknown losses. Six Japanese aircraft invaded and dropped bombs in Fuzhou at around 7:00 AM on the 29th, and bombed Changmen and Mawei, with minor losses. However, the above news has not been confirmed.

Chinese Troops Counterattack Ships in Wenzhou

After the Japanese army landed in Yuhuan off the coast of Wenzhou, a large number of fresh Chinese troops arrived and launched a counterattack. Currently, six Japanese warships are anchored off Yuhuan, with continued intentions. According to telegrams received by the shipping industry yesterday afternoon, three Japanese warships shelled the shore from Huanghuaguan off the coast of Wenzhou on the morning of the 30th, firing more than thirty rounds. The Chinese defense forces also returned fire.

Japanese Army Fails to Land at Chuanshan

After the Japanese army landed on Dinghai Island in the Zhoushan Islands, they have remained there and have not left. Although Chuanshan, which is separated from Dinghai by a body of water, is threatened, the military authorities of Zhejiang Province have stepped up security. According to reports received in Shanghai, two Japanese warships shelled Chuanshan on the morning of the 29th and launched six motorboats filled with Japanese troops, attempting to land under the cover of artillery fire. They were met with a head-on counterattack by the defense forces and failed to succeed.

Kangshu Arrives at Songjiang, Shenhua Oujiang

After the Wenzhou-Taizhou Garrison Commander forbade all ships from sailing to Wenzhou, preparations were also made to block the gap in the Oujiang blockade line. The Zhongyi Company's Kangsha Yilun, the last ship to leave Wenzhou for Shanghai, arrived at the mouth of the Wusong River at 12:00 PM yesterday. Because there were no vacancies at the Huangpu River Customs pontoons, it had to temporarily anchor at the mouth of the Songjiang River and is scheduled to sail into the Huangpu River again this morning. In addition, the British Yilong Company's Shenhua wheel, which loaded cargo in Shanghai and sailed to Wenzhou this time, telegraphed Shanghai yesterday, reporting that it had arrived outside the mouth of the Oujiang River and would sail into Wenzhou after being approved by the Chinese authorities.

Shenfu Sails to Shanghai, Shenguang Leaves Chuanshi

The British Yilong Company's Shenfu telegraphed Shanghai, reporting that it had loaded cargo and more than 70 refugees from Chuanshi, Fujian, the day before yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 7:00 AM this morning, docking at pontoons 26 and 27. Also, the Shenguang wheel telegraphed Shanghai last night, reporting that two-thirds of the ship's cargo had been unloaded. Today, due to the tense situation, unloading has been temporarily suspended. It was ordered to temporarily leave the Chuanshi pier and anchor in the waters near Chuanshi. The Mawei blockade is heavily guarded, which has caused obstacles to barge transportation.

Fujian-Zhejiang Shipping Lines Temporarily Interrupted

Since the situation along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian has become tense and Zhenhai has announced a blockade, all ships sailing on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, such as Feikang, Haifu, Baoli, Hana, Ende, and Kangsha Yi, and the Shanghai-Ningbo line, such as Moufu and Deping, have all been suspended. As for Swire's Xinbeijing Lun, it has changed its route to Xiudu in Fuzhou. Xiliangzhou, Yingzhou, Luzhou, and Jinan have changed their route to Hong Kong. Currently, the Shanghai-Ningbo-Wenzhou line is almost completely suspended, and transportation is interrupted.

### Japanese Troops Occupy American School in Dinghai

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reports that the Shanghai General Association of the American Baptist Church has received news that the church's primary school in Dinghai has been occupied by Japanese troops, and the Japanese flag is flying next to the American flag on the roof of the school building. The principal, Mr. Feng, is currently safe.

### Continued Indiscriminate Bombing; Japan Attempts to Block Northern Jiangsu; Jardine Matheson Ship Sails Upriver Under British Naval Escort; Japanese Side Tries to Obstruct Shipping in Shanghai Ports

North Jiangsu's Chongming Island's Beihai Gate, Qidong's Xingang, Lingdian Port, and Sanhe Port, which belong to the two counties, have experienced battles since the 24th of this month. Japanese warships and aircraft have indiscriminately bombed them, and this is still continuing as of yesterday. Jardine Matheson's Yihe Lun sailed to Northern Jiangsu on the day before yesterday, escorted by a British warship, because of

Grim Situation

Without docking in Xingang Lingdian Port, it sailed straight to Sanhe Port and docked that night. After unloading passengers and goods, it was fully loaded with passengers and goods at 2:30 PM yesterday and sailed back to Shanghai, docking at the Bund Garden Pier. It is scheduled to set sail for Northern Jiangsu again at 7:00 AM this morning. At the same time, the German Haibi Company's Lisha Lun has also joined the voyage. The terminal is said to be Qinglong Port. The German shipping companies all received a notification from the German consulate yesterday, stating that they had been

Notified by Japanese Authorities

That there are military operations in the ports of the Northern Jiangsu shipping lines, which have been blockaded. All ships must only sail up to Qinglong Port as their terminal. If they do not follow the above methods, the Japanese side will not be responsible for any dangerous events that occur to the ships. The German shipping companies, considering this matter to be related to the future of the company's business, once convened a meeting and collectively decided to request the German consulate to

Raise an Objection

To the Japanese side to restore the shipping lines of the ports on the Northern Jiangsu line in order to maintain the interests of shipping merchants. They also decided that if it were absolutely necessary, all ships would change to sailing at night, operating back and forth on shifts in order to save expenses and maintain business.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Plans to Further Lower Rice Prices; Market Closed on Sundays During Summer Vacation; Hoarders in the Market Became Active Again Yesterday

Shanghai citizens' food problems have been greatly affected by the speculation of speculators, which has caused market prices to fluctuate unpredictably. After the authorities set a maximum price limit of 21 yuan for high-quality rice, the city's food supply was able to safely pass. The rising trend in the market has been eliminated, and hoarders have also sold off in large quantities. The available funds in the market have suddenly increased, showing a trend of supply exceeding demand. Rice prices have gradually declined. The Shanghai rice mills still have 436,427 bags of rice in storage. Together with the spot goods in the rice shops' sales departments and the rice accumulated by citizens, the rice industry estimates that

The Total Rice in Shanghai

Is around one million bags, so the market's confidence is becoming more stable. Also, 3,000 tons of Saigon rice have been traded, and the source of rice from various countries is continuous. More than 4,000 to 5,000 bags are shipped to Shanghai every day. This number can slightly offset the daily consumption. It is heard that the Shanghai Municipal Council will further lower rice prices to benefit the citizens. Yesterday, the rice market became active again due to the hoarders, purchasing more than 4,000 bags. The purchases from each road were smooth, and each item

Increased in Price

By two or three jiao or one or two jiao. The market traded a total of about 10,000 bags in the morning. More than 3,000 bags were transported by wheel yesterday. The Market Management Committee issued Announcement No. 74 yesterday, stating that according to the resolution of the joint meeting of trade representatives on the 29th of this month, July 1st to 3rd are the annual settlement period for silver and banking businesses. The market is scheduled to be closed for two days on July 1st and 2nd, and will be

Business as Usual

On the 3rd. Also, during this summer season, the market will be closed for one day on Sundays, etc. The records are on file, and a corresponding announcement is made for public knowledge. Since the rules of the market were revised after the joint meeting of trade representatives, future disputes between traders in the market may be avoided. All traders have also vowed to comply with the newly revised rules, etc.

### Chen Laoqiu Passes Away

Mr. Chen Laoqiu, in his early years, studied with Mr. Yang Dongshan. His poems and essays were all fresh and elegant, and his seal carving was based on the Qin and Han styles, vigorous and pleasing. Compared to Wang Bingtie, Huang Mufu, he was almost unmatched. He was truly a talented artist in the modern seal carving world. Unfortunately, he suddenly contracted typhoid fever last month and passed away, at the age of only 36. Those who heard of it mourned him. Now, his friends Zhu Qishi, Sun Junxiang, Ying Tianlai, and colleagues from the Suyue Painting Society will organize and compile his posthumous works so that they may endure for a long time.

### Shanghai Still Hopes for the Issuance of Small Denomination Notes; Stamps Are Too Light and Small, and Users Often Lose Them

The copper coin shortage and panic in this city were quite serious when the trend first occurred last month. However, the difficulty was gradually removed by the use of stamps as a substitute by various sectors. After the tram and public transport companies of the two concessions issued temporary token notes, the situation became even more eased. Now, it is rare to see various merchants issuing their own substitute notes. Even if they do issue them, they are limited to their own business scope. As for the various merchants' groups' plan to issue joint substitute notes to remedy the difficulties in transactions, they have all voluntarily abandoned it. However, the use of stamps as small denominations is still practiced in the market. Because they are too light and small, users often lose them, and it is easy to damage them in the process of handover, which often leads to disputes. Various industries, especially small businesses, still hope that the Ministry of Finance will issue small denomination notes to transport to Shanghai to remedy the situation. It is generally believed that the use of stamps on the market is permissible as a temporary transition. However, over time, difficulties will inevitably arise, which will affect merchants' business.

### From Today, the French Police Department Will Reconduct a Household Census in the Concession; Each District and Alley Ordered to Have Landlords Fill Out Forms to Prevent Petty Criminals from Hiding and Disrupting Public Security

Since the French Concession Public Works Bureau promulgated the Alley System last winter, it immediately conducted a citywide household census to prevent petty criminals from hiding and disrupting the concession's public security. Now that half a year has passed, there are bound to be many changes in the living situation, so it has been decided to reconduct the census starting today (July 1st). The difference between this census and the previous one is that each residence will [be reported by one landlord, without the need for individual tenants to fill it out separately, that is, after the police department of the bureau issued the survey form. The survey form includes: (1) Road or district name, (2) House number, (3) Landlord's name, (4) Tenant's (second landlord's) name, (5) Age, (6) Nationality, (7) Occupation, (8) Number of people living with the tenant and their gender and age, (9) Degree of kinship or relationship, (10) Name, gender, age, nationality, occupation, and number of subtenants (third tenants), (11) Remarks. Note that this form is given by the Lizheng to each tenant. Each tenant must fill it out in duplicate and return it to the Lizheng within two days. One copy will be submitted by the Lizheng to the police station.

### Guerrilla Warfare Breaks Out in Western Shanghai: British Woman Narrowly Escapes Harm; Sudden Encounter with Hostilities, Bullet Pierces Tire; British Troops on Alert to Prevent Unforeseen Events

According to the "North-China Daily News," Mrs. Renshaw, a British woman residing at No. 79 Suzhou Road, narrowly escaped harm yesterday (the 29th) at nearly 8 PM. About fifteen Japanese soldiers were chasing guerrillas along the fields beside Avenue Haig, reaching the vicinity of the intersection of Zhongshan Road. They used Mrs. Renshaw's car as cover to fire at an unidentified target from behind. A reporter interviewed Mrs. Renshaw last night. She stated that the Japanese soldiers sped across the road, firing as they went. They first ordered her to stop, but upon seeing she was a foreigner, they desisted. Not wanting to be involved in any disturbances, she quickly drove to Great Western Road. While she was there, there were twenty gunshots. Although other parts of the car were not hit, both rear tires were punctured by Japanese bullets. At the time, another foreigner was driving from the opposite direction. He slowed down first, but upon seeing what was happening, he sped away. The reporter asked Mrs. Renshaw if she saw anyone shooting at the Japanese soldiers. She replied that she did not. She only intended to drive forward as quickly as possible and enter the British military zone, then stopped by the roadside to report to a British officer on duty there. It was said that Mrs. Renshaw's car was still parked there late last night, with the left rear tire severely damaged. Both tires were punctured and further damaged due to the hasty escape from the gunfire. Yesterday morning and between 8 and 9 PM last night, British troops in the area heard rifle and machine-gun fire from Hongqiao. To prevent unforeseen events, they parked a British military truck equipped with a searchlight behind the British sentry post by the roadside. According to several residents in the western district, they heard intense machine-gun fire mixed with rifle fire every few minutes between 8 and 9:15 PM. Just after 9 PM, they also heard artillery fire. The reporter drove through the area around 10 PM last night and found it completely quiet.

Suddenly, several robbers jumped out from the side of the road, drew their pistols, and blocked his path, robbing Hughes of more than 60 yuan in cash he was carrying. They also shot and wounded him in the arm before fleeing. Afterward, Hughes reported the incident to the British military authorities and the Jing'an Temple Police Station, requesting an investigation.

### According to Western Newspapers: The Truth about Gambling Dens in Western Shanghai; Twenty-Two Gambling Dens Protected by Organized Gangs; Total Number of Local Thugs Reaches Around Three Thousand; Flower Lottery Gambling is Particularly Rampant

The "North-China Daily News" reports that, according to investigations conducted by reporters over the past two weeks, there are a total of twenty-two licensed gambling dens on roads outside the settlement in the western district. They are protected by gangs organized by low-level members of society, estimated to include 660 armed men and 1,300 unarmed men. These numbers do not include the armed and unarmed "bodyguards" hired by well-known thugs running flower lottery gambling. The headquarters of the flower lottery is located in a lane on Robison Road, with about 200 branch offices set up in various areas on roads outside the settlement. Assuming that each branch office only hires one armed person and three unarmed persons, it is estimated that this city's

this kind of evil

employs a total of 2,760 local thugs. Each gambling den employs 10 to 15 armed guards, depending on its size and level, with one and a half times as many unarmed men, who are engaged in driving away idlers and keeping watch, and selecting some of them to inquire about the total turnover of competing gambling dens. In fact, the gambling dens only nominally compete with each other, as most are set up by the same group of people. These guards and their auxiliary unarmed "colleagues" receive about 35 yuan per month, plus allowances, and the allowances are always larger than the monthly salary. This group is

fully armed

with pistols, rifles, machine guns, and grenades. They meticulously observe each gambler who comes, know the names of most gamblers, and meticulously investigate their financial resources. Armed guards are not seen by people, as they all live in rooms at key points, working day and night. Each gambling den is equipped with a sophisticated alarm system, and protecting the large sums of money inside the gambling den is one of the guards' main tasks. Large gambling dens have about 300,000 yuan, with about 20,000 yuan placed on the gambling tables, and the remainder in meticulously guarded safes.

Unarmed thugs

wait near the gambling den, so that they can report if the gambling den is about to be attacked. Most of the guards are from Jiangbei and Ningbo, with the majority being former armed bandits or assassins. In addition to monthly salary and allowances, food and accommodation are provided by the gambling den. They also get a chance to gamble when off duty, so most of their income returns to the silver chests of the gambling den operators. There have been reports of these thugs robbing gamblers of their winnings, which they vehemently deny. However, it is a well-known fact that if someone who does not gamble often wins more than 3,000 or 4,000 yuan in one go, they will be "taken care of" by thugs when they leave the gambling den. The most recent incident occurred at a gambling den on Rue Remi. The mastermind behind the flower lottery is the famous

underworld

figure Gao Lansheng. In addition to the flower lottery, he also runs other gambling operations. On the evening of June 16, he was shot and seriously injured when he left a brothel on Shantou Road. Gao is nicknamed "Pockmarked Ah Gen." His wife has been repeatedly threatened by enemies in the opium and gambling business in recent years. The most affected by the scourge of the flower lottery are the coolie class. The smallest bet is only one copper coin, which pays 29 times if it wins. In parts of the western district outside the Public Settlement Police District, there are now about 200 flower lottery branch offices, which also employ armed guards, with unarmed persons serving as scouts and lookouts. The headquarters of the flower lottery employs 30 armed guards, with one at each branch office,

guarding all day long

and then escorting the day's earnings to the headquarters on Robison Road. The gambling dens and flower lottery offices described in this article are all licensed by the "Da Dao" authorities. It is said that this is a large source of income for the "Da Dao" government, so it can be stated with certainty that the total number of local thugs who directly live off this kind of evil in the Japanese-occupied areas of Shanghai is about 3,000, with armed thugs accounting for one-third. This does not include those in Pudong. In recent months, the opium and gambling business in Pudong has also flourished.

### Strictly Prohibit Combat Troops from Bringing Dependents; Those Who Dare to Disobey Will be Punished According to Military Law

The military discipline inspection groups of the National Government's military regions recently received an order from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, stipulating that front-line combat troops in all war zones, regardless of officers or soldiers, are strictly prohibited from bringing dependents. Those who dare to disobey will be punished according to military law and will not be leniently treated. Starting from July 1, if it is found that front-line combat troops in any war zone are still carrying dependents and moving with the army, or using military vehicles to transport dependents' personal belongings, in addition to ordering the vehicles and occupants to be impounded and severely punished, the responsible officers should also be jointly held accountable. In addition to issuing separate orders, a special telegram was sent to those responsible for inspection to maintain military discipline.

### Counterfeit Epidemic Prevention Certificates Seized in Hotel; Awaiting Investigation to Clarify Before Review

Yesterday, Lao Zha Police Station's Chinese head detective Bai Fumin and detective Song Wenqing were ordered to search various hotels. When they searched Room 26 of the Zhongxing Hotel at No. 11, Lane 513, Hankou Road, they found that the occupants, Ding Haiyang, Xu Yunyan, and a woman named Ding Li, were behaving suspiciously. They searched the room and seized several notebooks, several seals, and blank epidemic prevention certificates. The detectives suspected that Ding was selling counterfeit epidemic prevention certificates and passes, so they were detained and taken back to the police station. Subsequently, more notebooks, seals, and blank epidemic prevention certificates bearing the name of Dr. Yuan Xingfu (No. 459 Elgin Road), as well as many blank temporary permits from the Japanese Navy, were seized from Room 9 of the Yongan Inn at No. 10, Lane 127, Fujian Road. They were all taken to the police station and yesterday handed over to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Meng Tingke opened the court for interrogation. Police lawyer Qian Zhijiu explained the process, stating that the matter had not yet been thoroughly investigated, so he requested permission for the suspects to be temporarily detained for a week for detailed investigation to determine whether or not to prosecute them. After questioning by Judge Meng, they were ordered to be returned to custody and re-examined in a week.

### Traveler Dies from Poisoning

In Room 70 of the Baohe Hotel on Guangdong Road, a traveler registered as Sun Shaoquan, 50 years old, from Haimen, was found to have committed suicide by swallowing raw opium until about noon the next day. Someone reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station, and Detective No. 224 rushed to the scene and escorted Sun to Renji Hospital. Treatment was ineffective, and he died at 8 PM.

### Overseas Chinese Merchants Facilitate Shanghai-Kunming Transportation; Form Sino-French Express Transportation Company; Agreement Signed with French Authorities

Since the fall of Yuehan, Shanghai-Kunming transportation has only had the Haiphong route in Vietnam left. Due to the large number of goods shipped out of Shanghai in recent months, the Haiphong warehouses have been full. Even the major roads along the Haiphong wharves are piled high with goods, making it impossible to transfer them, which has greatly affected commerce. It is learned that Gong Chunli, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi, Vietnam, Ho Sai-kwong, former chairman of the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce (son of Sir Robert Ho Tung), and Shanghai merchants Ye Jiaxing and Ye Weiyi have jointly organized the Sino-French Express Transportation Company and have signed an agreement with the French railway authorities to open up a new route. The Shanghai-Kunming transportation will be safe and fast in the future.

### Refugee Population Statistics

### Owner of Lao Xie Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Shop Seized with Large Amount of Opium; Sun Zhaoming on the Run; Police Investigating; Sun's Wife Detained and Sentenced to Three Months by the Court

The Lao Xie Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Shop in the French Concession's Great World is owned by Sun Zhaoming and others from Nanhui. Over the years, they have made tens of thousands of dollars in profits due to their agile sales tactics. Last month, they were bombed twice, shocking society. The owner of the shop, Sun Zhaoming, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the local court four years ago for murdering two relatives, Zhu Ah Lan and his nephew, from Nanhui. After being released from prison, Sun stayed at home, residing at No. 20, Zhenping Lane, Rue Cardinal Foch all day long,

smoking opium.

Sun has a large opium addiction and needs to smoke about 30 yuan worth of opium every day, so he buys a large amount each time. To avoid attracting attention, Sun changed his name from Sun Zhaoming to Sun Zhiting and lived with his wife, Sun Chen (25 years old, from Changshu), and his younger brother, Sun Zhiyao, in the same house, spending their days smoking opium. This was learned by the anti-narcotics section of the French Police Department's criminal division. The police believed that Sun was committing a crime by buying and openly smoking large quantities of opium within the concession, so they went to the address to arrest him at 2 PM on the 24th of last month. Sun, who was sleeping upstairs, was shocked upon hearing the news and quickly

escaped over the roof to hide temporarily.

His younger brother, Sun Zhiyao, and his wife, Sun Chen, were arrested because they did not have time to escape. More than 100 taels of opium were seized on the spot. After Sun Zhiyao and others were arrested, the police paid close attention to Sun Zhiting's whereabouts and worked hard to investigate. Sun Zhiyao was released on the 27th because he was not suspected of smoking opium. His wife, Sun Chen, was sent to the Second Special District Court because the evidence of her possession of opium was conclusive. Sun Chen was sentenced to three months in prison for possessing opium, but considering that it was her first offense, she was allowed to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, calculated at three yuan per day. More than 100 taels of opium seized were confiscated.

### French Police Officer and Russian Police Officer Shot Dead; Japanese Side Admits Soldiers Fired; Sends Hongqiao District Commander to Offer Condolences; French Authorities Reportedly Satisfied with Peaceful Resolution

According to the French newspaper "Journal de Shanghai" on the 30th, the Japanese military spokesman stated at the Japanese news briefing yesterday that there have been incidents of peeping at telephone lines in the Hongqiao district for some time. In order to eliminate this, the Japanese army has set up sentries at certain distances along the railway line. These sentries, being isolated and helpless in the dark, pay more attention to movements from all directions. This is different from patrol soldiers in teams. It is recalled that on Tuesday (27th) night, a sentry suddenly saw a dark shape approaching the railway line. He flashed his flashlight to ask for the route, but suspecting that it was a thief, he fired a warning shot, without actually aiming. Afterwards, the other side also fired, so he fired back in response, resulting in a gun battle. According to the Japanese investigation, the French police officer, Russian police officer Kott, was wounded and killed by the first shot. Therefore, without waiting for the French authorities to protest, they sent liaison officers and the Hongqiao District Commander to the French Defense Forces Headquarters yesterday afternoon to explain and express their condolences. It is recently heard that the French military authorities are satisfied with the Japanese explanation, so according to the spokesman, this case has been settled. The spokesman also said that two thieves had been captured in that area before, one was executed by firing squad, and the other was sentenced to two years in prison.

In addition, it is reported that Russian police officer Kott No. 49 of the French Police Station was suddenly shot by thugs at around 11:40 PM on the 27th of last month while on duty in Panjiazhai, Tushanwan. The bullet entered from the upper left waist and exited from the right waist, causing him to die from serious injuries. It is learned that the police officer's funeral will be held on the 3rd of this month (Monday). The funeral service will be held at 9:45 AM on the same morning at the morgue at No. 300, Rue Talas. The body of the police officer will be buried in the Xujiahui Cemetery.

### Two Younger Brothers Accuse Older Brother of Plotting to Murder Their Father; Declared Not Guilty

Hu Chichang, nicknamed "Jiangbei Little Tycoon" from Yancheng, currently living in Jing'an Villa in Western Shanghai, had his parents and two younger brothers living in his hometown. After the August 13th Incident in 1937, they all came to Shanghai to live with Hu. On the night of the third day of the eighth lunar month of that year, Hu's father, Zhenxue, suddenly jumped off a building and was injured and died. It has been two years since then. Now his two younger brothers, Yuanchang and Shunchang, hired attorney Shi Jiutang to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court against Chichang for

plotting to murder their father,

embezzling his estate, and abandoning his younger brothers. They claimed that their father brought important items with him when he came, but the defendant made things difficult for him day and night, extorting money, and even beating him, causing their father to commit suicide. After the 64 mu of farmland in Yancheng left by their father was taken care of by the defendant in his capacity as the eldest brother, he privately mortgaged it to Jin Hantai to obtain funds to go to another port and even drove out his younger brother, Shunchang. They also filed a civil lawsuit, demanding the return of the land deeds. However, Hu Chichang also hired a lawyer to argue that his father suffered from mental illness and fell and injured himself when he jumped off the building. It had been investigated

and verified by the police and the court.

The ancestral property was kept by the mother and had not been mortgaged. As for supporting his younger brother, his mother was still alive, and the defendant was not responsible for this. Yesterday, Judge Jiang summoned both the plaintiffs and the defendant and witnesses for questioning. Hu Chichang had his paralyzed old mother brought to the court to prove that her father was not murdered and that the property had not been mortgaged. After questioning in court, the defendant Hu Chichang was declared not guilty, and the civil lawsuit filed by the plaintiffs was dismissed.

### Most Inland Water Routes Suspended

The Shanghai-Pinghu route, which had just resumed operation recently, was suspended again yesterday. It is said that there has been fighting in Pinghu for several days. Currently, of the inland waterway routes from Shanghai to various guerrilla areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, only those to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Minhang and Ye Xie in the suburbs of Shanghai can barely operate. Routes to other places are still suspended.

In addition, it is reported that Shanghai-inland passenger and cargo transport has always used Jiangyin Zhangjiagang as a key transshipment point. After the area was occupied by the Japanese army, the routes were suspended and switched to Yangtan Port for transshipment. However, there has been fighting at Yangtan Port from time to time, and the routes have been opening and closing intermittently. Having just recently reopened, they were suspended again yesterday. It is reported that guerrillas rushed into Yangtan Port and launched an attack on the evening of the 29th, resulting in fighting and chaos.

### Japanese Puppets Plan to Control Vegetables and Food Again

The Japanese puppets are actively implementing control over vegetables and food. They are now restricting general cargo traders, requiring them to "register" with the puppet authorities whether they are transporting goods from upstream to the inland or from the inland to Shanghai. Since the announcement of this measure on the 27th, Japanese troops in Minhang have intercepted unregistered cargo ships on the river surface, totaling more than 300 ships in the past three days. They have not been released as of yesterday. The puppet authorities will also set up puppet "vegetable markets" in Pudong Dongchang Road and Xujiahui Caojiadu in July to control the import of vegetables into the concession and collect a disguised "likin tax."

### Husband Commits Adultery, Wife Files for Divorce; Settlement Reached in Court; Agreement Signed to Repent and Continue Living Together; Conditions Established for Security

Qin, the wife of Xu Maochang, a major silk merchant, frequented dance halls last year, seduced Yang Jinglun, a young man from Wuxi, and committed adultery. After being bewitched, Yang's affection for his wife, Wang Shuxia, waned, and he often abused her. Wang initially did not understand the reason for her husband's change of heart until Xu Maochang exposed the affair last winter and reported it to the police, who arrested Qin and Yang together in the Cangzhou Hotel. During the interrogation by the First Special District Local Court, the truth was revealed. Later, Xu

settled out of court

by withdrawing the charges. It was difficult to agree with him, so the police were requested to file a lawsuit against Qin and Yang for adultery. After investigation, Xu, Qin, and Yang Jinglun were sentenced to imprisonment. Therefore, Wang Shuxia recently filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court for divorce from Yang based on the facts that her husband had committed adultery with others and abused her, and demanded compensation for losses. The

court hearing

has been reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that, after repeated mediation and persuasion by the relatives of both plaintiffs and defendants and the plaintiff's attorneys Jiang Yiping and Yang Yunshi, they reconciled. Yang Jinglun also admitted his previous mistakes and was willing to write a letter of repentance to reassure his wife of his future intentions. Therefore, Wang Shuxia has forgiven him and abandoned the divorce claim. Yesterday morning, when the continuation hearing was due, Judge Gui repeatedly enlightened both parties in court, and they reached

settlement terms

(1) The plaintiff and defendant will continue to live together in the future and be reconciled as before. (2) The defendant will pay the plaintiff 3,000 national currency, of which 1,000 yuan will be paid within two months, and the remaining amount will be paid in twelve months. (3) The 100 mu of farmland in Wuxi will be managed by the plaintiff. (4) If the defendant abuses the plaintiff again in the future to the point of being unable to live together and commits adultery again, the plaintiff may request a divorce and the defendant must pay 50,000 yuan. The couple signed the settlement record and returned home hand in hand. A storm has been settled.

Yunfei currently has hundreds of cars, more than a dozen branch stations, experienced drivers, and carefully inspected vehicles. Based on the spirit of serving society and with the convenience and safety of passengers as the premise, it goes all out without the slightest懈怠. Therefore, its business has been booming over the years, and the taxi as a necessary tool for transportation has also been generally recognized by the society, no longer regarded as a luxury item for pleasure. Yunfei's contribution to this is truly undeniable, and its future development is immeasurable. Now, on the occasion of the company's 20th anniversary, we will briefly describe Yunfei's overview:

Founding Era Yunfei Automobile Company began operations on July 1, 1919, with its address at No. 77 Huanlong Road in the French Concession. At that time, there were only ten taxis, all with open tops. There were only nine internal employees, and the total number of drivers and coppersmiths was no more than 20. The telephone number was initially "West 189," because the telephone company still used a regional numbering system at that time. After the automatic machine was modified, Yunfei's number was also changed, which is now the well-known "30189."

Adding Branch Stations Yunfei opened for a few years, and business in the commercial area gradually developed. In order to meet the needs, it first established a branch station on Renji Road. Since then, business has become more prosperous and the needs have become more urgent. Yunfei's branch stations have also been established everywhere, such as the three branch stations on Renji Road, Edward Road, and the Bund, which are specially established to facilitate passengers getting on and off the writing room. The Park Road Station, Manshi Road Station, and Nanjing Theater Branch Station are especially convenient for theatergoers to rent a car for transportation. Other stations, such as Huanlong Road Station, Jing'an Temple Station, and Yidingpan Road Station, are the main bases for supplying vehicles. Vehicles enter and exit, day and night, and the distribution is extremely convenient. Therefore, Yunfei customers can call a car at any time and arrive immediately, which is very convenient. Yunfei's branch stations are also equipped with reception rooms with comfortable seats, so that passengers can rest for a while without having to wait on the spot. In addition to having many branch stations, Yunfei also pioneered the establishment of proxy call offices, entrusting stores in various districts to call cars on their behalf to facilitate passengers. At the same time, it also took the lead in adopting the latest American electric clocks, which are accurate in time and simple in code. All stations adopt them uniformly, and the time is accurate to the second, so there will be no errors in calculating the travel time. All these are for the convenience of passengers.

Continuing to Purchase New Cars Yunfei Automobile Company has expanded its business, and the original vehicles are not enough to be distributed. It has added new cars many times. Now, in order to ensure that customers enjoy the ultimate comfort of riding, and at a time when foreign exchange is tight and car prices are soaring, it has ordered dozens of 1939 eight-cylinder sedans, which have been added to the dispatch starting in February of this year. It is expected that all of them will arrive in the near future. At that time, most of Yunfei's dispatch vehicles will be the latest eight-cylinder sedans, which are comfortable, stable, and fast. From the customer's point of view, what they enjoy is no different from having their own car, which has the convenience of having their own car without the expense of owning one.

General Situation of the Head Office Yunfei's business has advanced by leaps and bounds, and the original head office was not enough to expand. Therefore, on the Double Tenth Festival in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), it moved to the new site at No. 76 Daxi Road, which covers an area of more than 17 acres. The vastness of the foundation and the grandeur of the scale are the only ones seen in Shanghai's car dealership. As for the organization and facilities, they are even more complete. The head office has a general management office, an accounting office, a mechanical office, a vehicle office, and a mechanical parts warehouse, a tire department, a paint department, a uniform room, a carpenter's room, a battery room, a vehicle inspection room, a lathe room, a gasoline room, a tailor's room, a dormitory, a library, a dining room, a bathroom, a barber shop, and a kitchen. In addition, there is also a medical certificate office, which hires more than a dozen famous Chinese and Western doctors at sea to provide free diagnosis and treatment for employees and drivers all year round. Because of the large number of people, the company spends a considerable amount of money each year on medical expenses, which shows the generous treatment of employees and drivers.

Inspecting Vehicles Yunfei Automobile Company has spent huge sums of money to purchase the latest hydraulic lift to inspect vehicles. All vehicles are required to enter the dock for inspection every ten days and be given various small repairs. Every ten months, the car is completely disassembled and repaired separately. For example, the chassis is repaired by the chassis room, and the engine is repaired by the machine room, so that it is perfect and no different from a new one. Other parts such as crankshafts and transmissions are all subject to final inspection and then reassembled into a car. The various parts prepared are too numerous to count. Springs, spark plugs, etc. are also displayed in an orderly manner for replacement at any time. In addition, all parts used in the car body, such as door locks, etc., and various tools used in the machine room are all self-made and do not need to be sought outside. This shows the magnificence of its scale, the perfection of its equipment, and the sophistication of its technology. As for seeing the working conditions at that time, it can be deeply believed that Yunfei Automobile's safe and fast ride, giving passengers convenience and safety, has gone through a lot of heavy work.

Driver Training Yunfei Company is extremely cautious in selecting drivers, so its restrictions are strict. The Yunfei Vehicle Office knows that the issue of driver training should be given extreme attention. Therefore, it often convenes drivers at the general company to teach them all the knowledge about their work, explaining it repeatedly and seeking detailed information. The main point of its training is, of course, safety as the highest principle. Therefore, the necessary knowledge about machinery, as well as traffic regulations and first aid knowledge, are all emphasized. As for being familiar with the route and treating customers kindly and humbly, they are essential conditions for serving as a Yunfei driver. In short, safety and service are the two major goals that Yunfei strives to train drivers in. Pay Attention to Tires Tire damage, deflation, or bursting are not only a loss for the company, but also inconvenience passengers, as they may delay important matters. Yunfei's entire dispatch vehicle has rarely had tire deflation or bursts in the middle of the road. This is because Yunfei does not hesitate to use high prices to use particularly good tires and pays special attention to whether the tire pressure is appropriate. Yunfei is considerate of passengers in terms of safety, comfort, and time economy.

Car Body Paint Yunfei cars are generally disassembled, washed, and repaired separately during annual overhauls, and then reassembled into a car. The painting room applies paint, and all painting procedures are no different from those of a new car. Yunfei's head office has three painting rooms, all of which use special strong lights to facilitate the progress of the work. As for the paint, the most expensive special car paint is selected, and two types of brown-yellow colors are painted, shining brightly and shiningly, adding to the spectacle. Yunfei has more than 200 cars, and each car must be repainted every eleven months, so the amount of paint used each year is amazing.

Preserving Lost Items It is generally believed that if you lose an item in a taxi, there is no hope of it being returned, but this view is not true of Yunfei cars. Try visiting Yunfei's head office, and the lost and found department is clearly presented to the eyes. The department has specially made shelves and sealed them. All lost items found in each car at ordinary times, regardless of size or value, are generally collected in it and the date of collection and the car number are listed to await the owner's claim.

Giving Telephone Signs In order to eliminate the trouble of checking the number when calling, Yunfei first gave out two types of telephone signs, one for residential use and one for shop use. Since the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), they have been given out once every year without interruption.

Telephone Homophones "30189" is a well-known telephone number, and Yunfei has created homophones into sentences "Sui Lin Banquet Wine Cup" and slang "Three Fists One Cup of Wine" in order to help people in all walks of life to be elegant and to make it easier for customers to remember it forever.

### A Glimpse of the Yunfei Main Switchboard

Latest Telephone Scientific Management Dispatching Vehicles Answering Calls Well-Organized Extremely Fast

30189 30189, has almost become a well-known telephone number in Shanghai. The reason for this is that Yunfei's perfect and excellent service over the years has led to it, and the reason why its service has achieved such satisfactory results is that its excellent telephone organization has a great relationship with it. Now, we will briefly describe the general situation of the Yunfei main switchboard, which may also be something that readers would like to hear.

Latest Telephone The Yunfei main switchboard is located on the second floor of the company's Jing'an Temple Station. The telephones installed in it are the latest products custom-made by famous American manufacturers. The sophistication of its structure, the density of its organization, and the convenience of its management and operation are unmatched in Shanghai. Its price is high, but Yunfei is happy to purchase it for the sake of serving people throughout the city.

Red Light The machine has three rows of red, green, and white lights. The red light has nine lights, representing nine lines. If a red light is on, it means that a telephone is calling. If there are nine telephones calling at the same time, all the red lights will light up at the same time. Yunfei telephone number 30189 has only one number, but in fact it has nine lines. In addition, the operators are well-trained and responsive, so customers can connect to the telephone at any time and will never have to wait repeatedly.

Green Light The red light is on, and the operator immediately answers the call. Then the green light lights up, and the red light can light up again when another telephone is received to exert its function. After the operator answers, they immediately inform the nearest station to send a car. Its flexibility and speed are indeed such that the car arrives as soon as the bell rings. The Yunfei main switchboard is fully equipped with scientific soundproofing equipment, so there are no noisy sounds that can disturb the operator's hearing. The operator can concentrate on the work, and the telephone is so sophisticated, so the answering of telephones and the dispatching of vehicles are well-organized and extremely fast.

White Light The white light is installed on the intercom line. When the branch station and the main switchboard are talking to each other, the white light lights up as soon as the handset is picked up. When the other party answers, the green light immediately follows the white light. Because lighting is used instead of ringing, the sound of the conversation is very clear.

Dedicated Operator The Yunfei main switchboard has twelve operators, divided into three shifts, with four people in each shift, stationed full-time, working day and night, so no matter when you call a car, you will respond quickly and arrive as soon as you call, and there are very few delays or waiting for a connection.

What is especially worth mentioning is that the Yunfei general management office can connect to the main switchboard with a transfer machine at any time in its office to listen to whether the operator's response is fulfilling its duties, and all its management has been completely scientific.

### Yunfei Trademark

The taxi company uses the car as a tool for business, and the wheel is the most important part of the car. The reason why Yunfei Automobile Company's trademark is shaped like a wheel is that it takes its meaning from this. Ordinary stores operate mainly in stores, while Yunfei uses the telephone as the hub of its business. This well-known Yunfei telephone number 30189 is so clearly located in the center of the trademark. Yunfei's main station is like the axle of a wheel, and the branch station is the spoke of a car. The ratio is appropriate and the meaning is even more pertinent. As for the eight characters "Yunfei Automobile Service Citywide" on the wheel surface, it is the principle that Yunfei adheres to, and it has indeed reached the point of being consistent in name and reality. Yunfei Trademark participated in the trademark competition organized by the Shishi Xinbao and won the first prize.

### Yunfei Car Badge

The picture shows the car badge of Yunfei Automobile, which is triangular in shape, with the name Yunfei and the telephone number in the center. Yunfei has two hundred and several dozen cars, and each car has this triangular mark painted on the top and rear. It is simple and clear. Even if the customer is on several floors, they can know for sure that Yunfei Automobile is waiting outdoors as soon as they see this sign. Yunfei's facilities are all based on the convenience and safety of customers, and the use of triangular car badges is one example.

### The Contribution of Metong Automobile Company to Ford Car Owners and Car Dealerships

Metong Automobile Company (as shown in the picture) at the intersection of Myers Road and Route Foch in this city has complete equipment and a grand scale, and can be called one of the largest automobile companies in the world. General Manager Mr. Biers has been managing Ford products for a very early time. The history is long, and the development of Shanghai complements each other. Auto parts are necessary for Ford car owners and car dealerships. Mr. Clifforo Rockger, director of the company's parts department, has 21 years of professional experience in auto parts. He has been working with Manager Bi since 1921. Under his management, the company can continuously supply a large number of Ford parts to meet the needs of thousands of Ford car owners and those who own a large number of Ford vehicles. The company's repair department is newly equipped with ten hydraulic lifts to facilitate workers standing for repairs, and the light is also very bright. In addition, the battery room, wheel alignment station, and test room are all available. Mr. Cheli John, director of the repair department, is shrewd and capable, and has a wealth of experience. He has a high reputation in the auto service industry. The repair workers are specially trained. Sometimes, after the work is completed, they must gather and listen quietly to the director or Ford Motor Company engineering experts lecturing on the repair project and the usage of new-style machines. The company's paint shop is brightly lit, and in addition to ordinary paint, it is also equipped with the latest invented baking enamel machine for painting new-style Fords, Mavericks, Lincoln Safire, etc. Other equipment, such as the repair tool room, tire repair department, and car body manufacturing department, are all perfectly equipped with excellent workmanship and materials.

Transportation and Shipping Weekly

### Overview of Traffic Regulations in Hengyang

— Quechang

Hengyang is located on the upper reaches of the Xiang River and is the center of the Yuehan Railway and the starting point of the Xianggui Railway. Highways extend in all directions, and transport ships can navigate, making it a major transportation hub with access to all directions. The highways extend east through Jiangxi to Fujian, west to Guiyang and then into Sichuan and Yunnan, south to Guangdong and Guangxi, and north to Hubei. Water transportation depends on the water conditions. In winter, the water dries up, and navigation is suspended. In the other three seasons, navigation is possible between Baifang, Changsha, and Hengyang. However, since the fall of Han, Yue, and Gan, the traffic situation in this transportation hub has also been affected. Although the railway and highway routes remain the same, they are no longer smooth. The current situation is described below:

(A) Railway: (1) The Yuehan Railway has now shortened its route, only reaching Lechang to the south and Zhuzhou to the north, with Laiyang, Chen County, and Hengshan as stations in between. The ticket prices from Hengyang to Laiyang are: express train, first class 3.6 yuan, second class 2.3 yuan, third class 1.15 yuan; slow train, first class 3 yuan, second class 2 yuan, third class 1 yuan. To Chen County by express train, first class 8.25 yuan, second class 5.3 yuan, third class 2.65 yuan; slow train, first class 7.05 yuan, second class 4.7 yuan, third class 2.35 yuan. To Lechang by express train, first class 14.55 yuan, second class 9.4 yuan, third class 4.7 yuan; slow train, first class 12.7 yuan, second class 8.5 yuan, third class 4.25 yuan. From Hengyang north to Hengshan, express train, first class 3.3 yuan, second class 2.1 yuan, third class 1.05 yuan; slow train, first class 2.7 yuan, second class 1.8 yuan, third class 0.9 yuan. To Zhuzhou by express train, first class 7.8 yuan, second class 5 yuan, third class 2.5 yuan; slow train, first class 6 yuan, second class 4.4 yuan, third class 2.2 yuan. For luggage, a fee of 0.01 yuan per kilogram per kilometer is charged for exceeding the limit. There is one express train and one slow train each way. The express train takes about 11 hours from Hengyang to Lechang and about 5 hours to Zhuzhou. The slow train takes about 15 hours from Hengyang to Lechang and about 5.5 hours to Zhuzhou. (2) The Xianggui Railway runs directly from Hengyang to Guilin North Station, passing through Lijiaping, Lengshuitan, Xing'an, and other stations. The ticket prices from Hengyang to Lijiaping are: first class 5.55 yuan, second class 3.7 yuan, third class 1.85 yuan; to Lengshuitan, first class 7.95 yuan, second class 5.3 yuan, third class 2.65 yuan; to Xing'an, first class 16.8 yuan, second class 11.2 yuan, third class 5.6 yuan; to Guilin North Station, first class 19.95 yuan, second class 10.3 yuan, third class 6.65 yuan. The journey from Hengyang to Guilin takes about 16.5 hours. For luggage exceeding the weight limit, the fee is calculated at 0.01 yuan per kilogram per kilometer.

(B) Highway: (1) Hengyang to Changsha, 184 kilometers, ticket price 9.2 yuan, about 7.5 hours. (2) Hengyang to Xiangtan, 134 kilometers, ticket price 6.7 yuan, about 4 hours. (3) Hengyang to Baoqing, 136 kilometers, ticket price 6.8 yuan, journey 5 hours and 10 minutes. (4) Via Qiyang to Lingling, 157 kilometers, ticket price to Qiyang 5.2 yuan, to Lingling 7.85 yuan. Journey to Qiyang 3.5 hours, to Lingling 5 hours and 15 minutes. (5) From Hengyang East Station via Laiyang to Yizhang, 193 kilometers, ticket price to Laiyang 3.1 yuan, to Yizhang 9.65 yuan, journey to Laiyang 2 hours, to Yizhang 6 hours. (6) From Hengyang East Station to Jiehualong, 235 kilometers, ticket price 11.75 yuan. The free luggage allowance for each route is 20 kilograms. For each additional 10 kilograms, the responsible party charges 0.065 yuan per kilometer, and the passenger pays 0.06 yuan.

(C) Waterway: (1) Hengyang to Xiangtan, small steamboats operate, departing at 6:00 AM daily, ticket price 1.6 yuan. (2) Hengyang to Qiyang, also small steamboats operate, departing at 7:00 AM daily, ticket price 2 yuan. (3) To Lingling, passengers share the same boat as those going to Qiyang, ticket price 3 yuan.

(D) Joint Transportation between Hunan and Jiangxi: In addition to the above waterway transportation, the Hunan South Highway Bureau and the Jiangxi Highway Bureau jointly operate a joint transportation service between Hunan and Jiangxi, allowing passengers to reach Ji'an, Jiangxi from Hengyang on the same day. Each day, each side operates three passenger cars, all departing at 5:00 AM, ticket price 20.44 yuan per person, journey of one day, with meals in Jiehualong, total distance 440 li.

### Post-War Shipping on the Lesser Yangtze River

— Yuan

After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, at the end of the Yangtze River, there was a ship like the Victoria (over 200 tons, not the ocean-going mail ship operated by the Italian Postal Shipping Company) traveling between the Shanghai pontoon bridge (Qiyakou). This location is between Taicang and Changshu, and passengers and goods could travel east to Taicang, west to Changshu, and then transferred to various places in Suxi. At that time, Shanghai was facing a food crisis, and the interior was experiencing a severe shortage of daily necessities, so merchants were engaged in round-trip trading, and everyone made several times the profit. Shipping companies also greatly increased freight rates (rice freight was about 1.2 yuan per bag, compared to only 0.2 yuan before the war; cattle freight required more than 20 yuan per head), and also made huge profits. This was the most prosperous period of the Lesser Yangtze River shipping industry after the war. In the spring of last year, the shipping industry saw profits, and small companies sprang up like mushrooms after rain, with a large increase in the number of ships, and the routes were also extended to the area of Baimao Kou Changyinsha. At the same time, the Beisha routes to ports such as Hutong, Shuji, Niuhong, Lingdian, and Sanhe also opened one after another. During this period, although there were many ships, the number of ports also increased, so both passenger and freight transport were still busy. At that time, the ships operating included Victoria, Mini Maller, Henry, Hyde, Haiyi, Changde, Fulu, Deyao, Haikang, and several ships from Jardine Matheson and Taikoo, totaling more than a dozen ships.

By summer and autumn, new ports appeared one after another, with Hupukou taking a unique advantage due to its geographical location. This place is only a dozen li from Changshu County, with convenient transportation. Changshu and neighboring Kunshan are both rice-producing areas. At that time, land routes were blocked and food could only be transported through Hupu.) Freight transport suddenly became developed. Every day, 7,000 to 8,000 bags of rice were exported from there. At this time, the regular ships that went directly to Hupukou included Jiangding, Xin Jiangnan, Kaishi Deng, and Wo Leif, etc. Other ships also stopped at this port, totaling no less than thirty ships. However, with so many ships, competition became fierce, and freight rates dropped sharply (the lowest rice freight rate dropped to below 0.3 yuan per bag, and cattle freight dropped to 7 or 8 yuan per head.) By winter, passenger and freight traffic decreased, and local bans on rice exports led to a de facto standstill due to lack of goods to transport. However, the two ports of Xinsheng and Zhanghuang (south of Rugao in Jiangbei) successively opened, and at the end of the year, a large number of marinated meat, cattle, peanuts, and lard were transported to Shanghai, and shipping in these ports was also temporarily booming. (That is, most of the pigs eaten in this city are still transported from that port.) Since this spring, trains and cars have been passing through, and now that it is the time of year when the old and new crops meet, freight transport is scarce, so the ships have stopped operating one after another. Currently, only Deyao, Changde, Haiyi, Haikang, Kaishi Deng, Xin Jiangnan, and several ships from Yi Tai are still operating.

### Ford's Contribution

This year's five Ford vehicles, in their size, style, power, and price, all meet your needs, and their value is always associated with the Ford name. Among them, Ford and Lincoln are distinctly different. Today, people in society feel the need for various cars between Ford and Lincoln. The Ford Motor Company has continuously produced various noble and valuable unique cars to fill this gap; and the first to be launched is the Lincoln Zephyr, which has introduced the use of the 12-cylinder engine into the medium-priced car category. At the same time, new principles are applied in terms of structure and style, so that it always stays ahead of the times. The next is the introduction of the special Ford V8. And the new car that joined the noble Ford Group this year is the Mercury car, the Mercury eight-cylinder car, in the lower medium-priced car category, its position is between the special Ford Lincoln Zephyr. And its value, only factories that use special methods and resources, such as Ford, can produce it. The above five cars are better than the products of other factories and are worth buying.

Ford's repair service is one of the most popular car repair organizations in the world. Wherever we go, there are Ford repair services, and this service is very attentive and satisfactory. Today, Ford's repair services in the United States have thousands of locations, and there are thousands more reliable parking lots and repair stations, all with the genuine Ford parts logo. Ford dealerships everywhere are equipped with specific Ford repair tools and equipment, which are extremely accurate and reliable, saving time and money. The parts used are all genuine Ford products, and their excellent quality and precise dimensions are exactly the same as those used in the original car, and the methods set by the Ford factory make the repair costs very low.

### Routes from Shanghai to the Interior

— Xun

Recently, the traffic situation from Shanghai to the interior has changed greatly. Originally, one could take the eastern Zhejiang ports such as Wenzhou or Ningbo and then pass through Jinhua and Nanchang to reach the interior. In addition, there are the ports of Fuzhou, Shantou, Guangzhou Bay, and Beihai, all of which are gateways to the interior. Now, the various shipping companies in Wenzhou, Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Beihai have successively suspended their services. Since the outbreak of war in Shantou, passenger transport has also been cut off. Although Guangzhou Bay is a French concession, the highway between the bay and Canglin has been destroyed, making travel very difficult. Therefore, taking the route through Vietnam is the only safe way. Regarding the detailed situation of this route, this publication has repeatedly recorded it.

### Travel Questions and Answers

Answer: Ma Fuliang, Zhang Qingchang, Qian Hanjun (1) The route from Shantou to the interior has been reported to be impassable. The safest route is only through Vietnam. Please see the description below for details. (2) If you want to find travel companions, please ask China Travel Service to introduce you.

Answer: Yingjun (1) The safest way to go to Yiwu, Zhejiang from Shanghai is to go through Wenzhou. However, it is extremely difficult to buy tickets to Wenzhou. You must have a Wenzhou local guarantor before you can go from Wenzhou through Qingtian Lishui to Jinhua, and then take the train from Jinhua to Yiwu. The total cost is about 30 yuan.

Answer: Luo Chongmin (1) The only safe route from Nanning, Guangxi to Shanghai is as follows: Nanning - Longzhou (bus) - Lang Son (bus) - Hanoi (train) - Haiphong (train) - Shanghai (ship). The minimum total travel cost is more than 90 yuan national currency. However, before departure, you should apply to the Guangxi government authorities for a transit passport, which takes about seventeen days.

Answer: Shen Baochang, Chen Yunxiang, Jin Ge, Chen Qiyu (1) The safest way to go from Shanghai to Guiyang is to take the route through Haiphong. After arriving in Haiphong by boat, one can go to Guiyang via Hanoi Lang Son Longzhou Nanning Liuzhou, which takes about six days. The lowest cost is more than 50 yuan national currency (excluding Shanghai-Haiphong boat ticket). The second is to take the train from Haiphong to Kunming, and then take the highway bus from Yunnan to Guiyang, which takes six days and costs more than 60 yuan. (2) Whether you go to Guizhou through Guangxi or Yunnan, you must have your identity certificate, which can be issued by the school or business. If not, it can be certified by a familiar shop. (3) If you do not have a substantial guarantor when requesting a signature from the French consulate, you need to pay a deposit of 200 Vietnamese dollars. (4) From Guiyang to Renhuai, you can go to Renhuai from Guiyang via Zhenqian Qianxi Jinsha. Although there is a highway in this section, there is a lack of passenger cars, making travel difficult.

### Recent Developments in Universities Around the Country New School Buildings of Xiamen University in Changting Bombed Again Tsinghua University's Five Research Institutes Ready

Xiamen University

(Changting Correspondent) The school buildings of Xiamen University in Xiamen were destroyed during the war. After the school moved to Changting, it was bombed by aircraft on April 7 this year. Except for student Liu Xiheng who was injured in the eye, all teachers and students were safe. Yingxuezhai and the dormitory for visiting students were completely destroyed. The office, auditorium, science laboratories, Tongan Hall, the third-grade dormitory, and the commissioner's office in Zone 4 were also partially collapsed, with an estimated loss of more than 3,000 yuan. Since the bombing, the school has designated evacuation locations and revised class schedules, and classes have resumed on May 1.

Peking University

(Kunming Correspondent) The Institute of Liberal Arts of Peking University was suspended during the war. It is now scheduled to resume in the next academic year and recruit ten graduate students. The subjects are divided into five departments: history, linguistics, Chinese literature, archeology, and anthropology. The salary is 50 yuan per month for living expenses. The examination is divided into two phases. The first time to receive papers is July 15, and the examination is on August 5. The second time to receive papers is August 30, and the examination is on September 15. Candidates who pass the preliminary review of their documents and papers will be notified separately to take the exam in Kunming or Chongqing. The registration location is No. 2, Caisheng Lane, Kunming.

Tsinghua University

(Kunming Correspondent) All the school buildings of Tsinghua University in Beiping and the South Courtyard where the members of the Management Committee lived are now stationed by troops. This spring, someone came from Beiping and said that the library was used as a hospital for wounded soldiers, and the new gymnasium and biology museum were used as stables. The loss of equipment, books, and instruments in the new South Courtyard Club and various museums is difficult to describe. The school moved to Yunnan and was renamed Southwest Associated University. In April last year, there were more than 600 students, and more than 200 students graduated in July. There were more than 200 faculty members. The school buildings were rented. The organization is divided into four colleges of liberal arts, law, science, and engineering, and eighteen departments (Chinese literature, foreign languages, history and society, philosophy and psychology, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, geology, geography and meteorology, law, politics, economics, commerce, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, aviation). A normal college was established last summer. In February this year, a telecommunications training course was attached to the Department of Electrical Engineering, with a study period of half a year, to train technical talents. The source of funds for the Associated University is 40% of the original funds of Peking University and Tsinghua University, and 40% of the subsidy that Nankai should receive from the Ministry of Education, totaling less than 80,000 yuan per month. Fortunately, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund and the China Cultural Foundation subsidized books and instruments at the beginning of the school, and slightly replenished them. As for the construction costs, about 200,000 yuan was collected from a part of the subsidy from the China Foundation and the remaining funds of the three schools. Last summer and autumn, the number of students increased sharply. In the 28th academic year, with the approval of the Ministry of Education, the remaining funds of Tsinghua in the first half of the year were allocated to increase 15,000 yuan per month. In terms of research work, in addition to the original three research institutes of agriculture, aviation, and radio, two institutes of national conditions census and metallurgy were added last autumn. These five institutes are ready and the work has made considerable progress. Tsinghua's public-funded students studying in the United States were temporarily suspended from taking the examination last summer. There are still 40 to 50 people who have studied in Europe and the United States before, and the living expenses of these two items have been reduced to save money.

Zhejiang University

(Yishan Correspondent) After Zhejiang University moved to Yishan, the second, third, and fourth grades started classes on November 1 last year. The first-grade freshmen started classes two months later because the unified enrollment was announced later. In the first semester of the 27th academic year, there were a total of 362 first-grade students, 188 second-grade students, 154 third-grade students, and 88 fourth-grade students. Due to the increase in the number of normal colleges and students, teachers have also been slightly added. The normal college has 81 first-grade freshmen. A preparatory class was added this spring, and more than 50 people have arrived. In order to help poor students and students who have withdrawn from the war zone, in addition to the quotas for public-funded students and free students, the school has recently implemented a loan system on a wider scale. Some students earn a living by serving in the military. From the president to the faculty, most of them have moved their salaries and wedding and funeral gifts to scholarships and donations to comfort the wounded and killed soldiers. The school was bombed once on February 5, but fortunately no one was injured. A part of the office and dormitory was destroyed, with a loss of 30,000 yuan. The faculty and staff then donated 4,000 yuan to help the students. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, classes have been evacuated to a safe area.

### Hua Dong Christian Nine Middle Schools Held Joint Graduation Ceremony Yesterday. A Total of 573 Senior and Junior High School Graduates. Speeches by Gu Huiren, Luo Peide, and Jiang Guiyun

Hua Dong Christian Nine Middle Schools held a joint graduation ceremony at the Great Shanghai Theater at 9:30 AM on the 30th. Over 1,400 students, parents, guests, faculty, and graduates attended. The Chinese national flag was hung in the auditorium, flanked by the British and American flags. The stage was decorated with more than a dozen flower baskets prepared by various schools. The meeting started on time, with the Chiang Hwa & Company providing a sound system, broadcasting each item clearly and loudly. The details are recorded below:

Participating Schools

In terms of units, there were nine schools: Mingde Jian Shi, Qingxin Girls' Middle School, Qingxin Middle School, McLaren Middle School, Jinghai Girls' Normal School, Hujun Girls' Middle School, Biwen Girls' Middle School, Hua Dong United Middle School, and the Methodist Joint Girls' Junior Middle School. Hua Dong United Middle School included fourteen schools: Zhijiang, Trinity, Zhonghua, Hongdao, Xiuzhou, Jinling, Yuqun, Zhensheng, Chongying, Cuiying, Huiwen, Fushi, Lishi, and Huilan. The Methodist United Middle School included four schools: Yinghua, Jinghai, Hujun, and Muwei, totaling twenty-five schools.

Order of Proceedings

The meeting began with music at 9:30 AM. Guests, faculty, and students took their seats. Everyone stood at attention to listen to the national anthem and sang "O Beautiful China." Dr. Bao Zheqing offered a prayer. Principal Gu Huiren delivered the opening address. Bishop Luo Peide gave a speech. Tian Ming'en, Cao Cen, Huang Feiran, and Huang Shicheng sang a quartet. Principal Jiang Guiyun delivered a speech on behalf of the participating school principals. Diplomas were presented by individual principals. The meeting adjourned at noon.

Summary of Speeches

(1) Principal Gu Huiren stated in his opening address that he had two feelings about today's ceremony. First, all schools have school buildings and auditoriums that cannot be lived in and had to come here to borrow space for the ceremony, which is not an honor but a disgrace that everyone should remember and not forget. Second, during this time of national crisis, many have suffered directly or indirectly. You are fortunate to have received education peacefully and to have graduated, enjoying special privileges. Since you enjoy special treatment, you should strive harder to contribute and repay. (2) Bishop Luo Peide, who has been in China for over forty years, spoke fluent Chinese and quoted classical allusions from both Chinese and Western cultures, saying that even after graduation, you have only gained a superficial understanding. The path of learning is extremely profound. Even if you read a lot, entering a library and seeing the shelves full of books will make you feel inadequate. Therefore, you should continue to study hard and, most importantly, have confidence so that you do not give up halfway. (3) Principal Jiang Guiyun, on behalf of the participating principals, hoped that those who want to pursue further education will continue to do so, studying various specialized technologies to meet the needs of the times. He hoped that normal school students would lead by example, be role models for teachers, and establish a foundation for national education. He hoped that those seeking employment would maintain high moral character, develop strong physiques, cultivate a passion for research, emphasize the spirit of cooperation, and strive forward with the spirit of sacrifice and service to the public in the spirit of Christianity.

Issuance of Certificates

After the academic directors of each school announced the names of the graduates, the principals Zhang Rongzhen (Qingxin Girls' Middle School), Jiang Guiyun (Jinghai), Wang Peizhen (Biwen), Qiu Liying (Hujun), Rong Meili (Minde), Qiu Liying (Methodist), Zhang Shilin (Qingxin Middle School), Bai Yuehan (McLaren), and Gu Huiren (Hua Dong) presented certificates or diplomas in succession.

### Buying Trend Unabated, Foreign Exchange Continuously Tightening

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions showed no changes in the listed prices. However, the situation in the unofficial market continued to be tight due to the continued strong demand for settlement from foreign firms. In addition, Sassoon, a Western merchant, was aggressively buying, and Youli on behalf of Tianjin gangs and a certain party followed suit. Furthermore, it was difficult for both Chinese and foreign banks to obtain foreign exchange, especially US dollars. As a result, under the triple pressure of buying, the market rarely looked back. Although they were unwilling to supply US dollars at 6.15625 pence per dollar or 12.75 yuan per dollar, they required cash payment on the spot. Other banks were unwilling to sell cheaply, and the gangs had softened to above-market prices, approaching the HSBC's maintained supply price (6.5 pence and 12.625 yuan). The market closed at the tightest price of the day, with most transactions settled by clearing accounts. The Hong Kong dollar also softened to 44 yuan. From today until July 3rd, the market will be closed for two days due to the banks' semi-annual settlement, for a total of three days including Sunday. The market will reopen as usual on July 4th.

Sassoon Resumes Aggressive Buying

In the early morning, the price of London large silver bars for both near and far dates fell by 0.25, and the price of silver in New York also fell by 0.5%. The price of gold in London remained unchanged. The exchange rates of British and American currencies remained unchanged. The exchange rate against Shanghai was 0.0625 higher, and the exchange rate against France was 0.02 higher. The US dollar was unchanged against the British pound, 0.015 lower against Shanghai, and 0.00625 lower against France. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices of spot currencies at banks in the morning were 6.59375 pence per British pound and 12.84375 yuan per US dollar, unchanged for the British pound and 0.03125 tighter for the US dollar compared to the previous close. After opening, a certain bank suddenly dumped currencies, stabilizing the market. It was reported that the bank sold spot US dollars to the American Bank of China at 12.875 yuan. When HSBC announced its listed prices, there were no changes. When the balance tax on silver was announced to be exempted, the major foreign firms were settling accounts frequently, and Sassoon, a Western merchant, was also aggressively buying. In addition, foreign banks such as British and American banks were unwilling to sell cheaply, so the market gradually tightened. It was reported that foreign banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered and Chinese banks sold spot British pounds to Sassoon at 6.5625 pence. Subsequently, American Bank of China and Chinese banks also sold spot US dollars to Sassoon at 12.8125 yuan. Near noon, only the Hong Kong dollar was traded, and the spot price was only 44.25 yuan due to aggressive buying by foreign firms. It also showed signs of softening. By the noon close, the selling prices of spot currencies at banks were 6.5625 pence per British pound and 12.78125 yuan per US dollar.

The Tianjin Gang Also Showed Strong Absorption

The volume of transactions in the afternoon suddenly decreased, but the market continued to tighten because Youli, acting on behalf of the Tianjin gang and a certain party, suddenly began aggressively buying. It was reported that Youli settled with its counterparts for spot British pounds at 6.5625 pence and spot US dollars at 12.75 yuan. Afterwards, the Hong Kong dollar also softened to 44 yuan, but no transactions were reported. A foreign firm then made a purchase agreement from a foreign bank for British pounds at 6.5 pence after customs clearance (i.e., delivery on July 4th) and US dollars at only 12.625 yuan. By the late close, the selling prices of spot currencies at banks were 6.53125 pence per British pound and 12.6875 yuan per US dollar. As a result, the British pound continued to tighten by 0.0625, and the US dollar tightened by 0.1875. The Hong Kong dollar was also sold at 0.5 yuan at the final price.

### Half-Day Gold Market: Volatility Decreasing, Transactions of 400 Taels

Yesterday's cash gold dark market conditions only had morning trading. All transactions made in the afternoon must be settled overnight. Because settlement fell within the customs closure period, the industry decided to suspend trading for three and a half days until July 4th (i.e., next Tuesday), when trading will resume as usual. Although yesterday morning's fluctuation was only 13 yuan, the situation remained vague. At the opening, the market once fell to a low of 2,540 yuan due to the resurgence of selling pressure from the northern gangs. Later, a certain bank frequently absorbed gold on behalf of foreign firms, and the domestic foreign exchange market tightened, causing the market to rebound and rise to a peak of 2,593 yuan. Near noon, cash gold firms sold gold, causing the price to fall back to 2,588 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, the off-floor market opened and rose to around 2,595 yuan, resulting in a closing price that was 2 yuan lower but actually 5 yuan higher. Trading was active in the half-day, with approximately 400 taels traded. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops did not change. The price of customs gold and pure gold remained unchanged.

No Major Changes in Gold

Since the beginning of the day, the northern gangs have been eager to sell gold (10 taels per bar), and retail investors were also weak, causing the opening price to fall by 5 yuan. It was reported that a securities gang sold 50 taels to a silver shop gang at a price of 2,585 yuan on behalf of a northern gang. Later, there was a shortage of buyers, and the price fell by another 5 yuan. A money exchange firm also sold 50 taels to a silver shop gang and a certain bank on behalf of a northern gang at the same price. At this time, the buying pressure from a certain bank remained strong, and the northern gangs had stopped selling and were observing. The exchange rate in Guanwai frequently turned upwards. The bank bought 50 taels from a silver shop gang and a money exchange firm each at 83 yuan. Afterwards, the supply of sellers was very weak, and the price rose rapidly by 7 yuan. The bank bought 20 taels from the silver shop gang at 90 yuan. At this time, retail investors also showed strong buying interest, and the price rose by another 3 yuan. The money exchange firm bought 10 taels from a gold shop at 93 yuan. Afterwards, a cash gold firm suddenly started selling, and the market stabilized. The cash gold firm sold 50 taels to the money exchange firm at 90 yuan. Later, the bank bought 30 taels from the cash gold firm at 92 yuan (the bank's purchases were mainly on behalf of foreign firms). Near noon, the market suddenly weakened slightly, falling by 4 yuan. The bank sold 20 taels to a money exchange firm on behalf of a customer at 2,588 yuan, which was the closing price for noon. In the afternoon, trading was suspended due to the settlement period. However, the off-floor market had risen to around 2,595 yuan, due to the continued tightening of the foreign exchange market. Compared to the noon closing price of 2,588 yuan, the result was a 2 yuan fall compared to the previous day, but in reality, it was a rise of 4-5 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold firm's own brand was 2,600 yuan, and the receipt was over 2,585 yuan. The spot gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. It was reported that few people were doing customs clearance.

The Price of Gold Jewelry Remained Unchanged

The price of gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged because the price of gold was rarely changing. Dà Tóng Hang still suspended gold jewlery for sales at its original price of 263 yuan, and Xīn Tóng Hang sold for 261 yuan, repurchasing at 255 yuan.

The Price of Pure Gold Remained Unchanged

According to a London cable on the 29th, the price of pure gold remained unchanged at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6.5 pence per ounce. As a result, the Central Bank of China's cash purchase price also remained at 1,212.6 yuan. The listed price of customs gold also remained unchanged at 2.396 yuan, and the standard gold price in Shanghai also remained fixed at 1,207.9 yuan.

### Settlement Arrived, Discount Rate on Drafts Plunged by About 20 Yuan, Interbank Lending Rate Also Low at 0.2

Yesterday, the discount rate on exchange drafts and notes plummeted. Because banks' semi-annual settlement has arrived, those who needed cash had already discounted them several days ago. As a result, yesterday's market saw excess supply over demand. The discount rate per 1,000 yuan fell from around 90 yuan to 75 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell further to 72.5 yuan, a drop of 19.5 yuan compared to the previous day. It was reported that when banks reopen on July 4th, the silver and money industries will use interbank transfers, reducing the need for cash. The decline in the premium also had an impact, and the interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association was also lowered by 0.2, with both morning and afternoon rates at 0.2.

### Large Silver Bars Entered the 18-Pence Mark

According to a London cable on the 29th, speculators continued to sell silver, and there were few buyers. The market was weak and turned flat after closing. India bought silver at the listed price. The prices of large silver bars for both near and far dates fell by another 0.25, entering the 18-pence mark. According to a New York silver cable, the spot price of silver also fell by another 0.5%. According to a Bombay silver cable, the decline in the price of silver in India slowed down slightly, with the spot price falling by only 3 annas, the July price falling slightly by 5 annas, and the August price falling by 7 annas.

### Settling Accounts and Covering Positions: British and American Gold Notes Soar

Yesterday, both British sovereign gold and British-American exchange rates remained unchanged. Due to banks settling accounts and foreign firms engaging in heavy payments, coupled with strong demand from Japanese banks and Western merchants, the supply of foreign exchange in the local market was sluggish. As a result, the British exchange rate was 6.625.53125, up by 0.0625 from the previous day. The American exchange rate was 12.75, also up by 0.125. The red market opened low because the bank account settlement period had arrived, and will be closed for three days starting tomorrow. Many speculators closed out their positions, and although exchange rates were tight, the red market relaxed, with transactions only reaching a low of 2,585 yuan. Money exchange businesses were sluggish, falling to a low of 80 yuan. Gold shops took the opportunity to buy low, hovering around 90 yuan. The noon closing price was 2,588 yuan, down two yuan from the previous day. No transactions were made in the afternoon, but active buyers absorbed a considerable amount, and the after-hours trading price rose to 96 yuan. The demand for foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds was quite strong. Banks and money houses supplementing their positions further boosted the need for British and American gold notes, causing the market price to rise significantly. The demand for Hong Kong francs and other notes was also strong, with prices also rising. The evening market saw 9.90 for gold notes and 9.10 for Korean notes. There was not much trading at the guild. Qin Tai sold 500 yuan of American gold notes, Xiang Tai sold 500 yuan of American gold notes, and Ren Tai sold 100 yuan of American gold notes. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds rise by 0.20, British gold notes rise by 0.40, American gold pounds rise by 0.50, American gold notes rise by 0.18, Hong Kong notes rise by 0.01, French franc notes rise by 0.002, and Canadian and Philippine notes each rise by 0.10. Other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities: Rubber Stocks Unaffected by Warfare

The stock market at the exchange was unsettled due to European news, which affected the New York stock market, causing prices to fall. The local stock market was also sluggish as a result, with few buyers. Throughout the day, only Jardine Matheson shares had transactions, with 9,300 shares traded at prices ranging from 18.60 to 18.90 yuan, with the closing bid price at 18.60 yuan. The rubber market was particularly stable. Although the European situation was tense and the American market was weak, speculators believed that rubber's position would remain strong regardless of war or peace. Furthermore, with the foreign exchange market tight, the market anticipated good results from purchasing local rubber stocks. The exchange will be closed for the summer holidays on the 1st and 3rd of this month, as usual.

The London market prices for Far Eastern companies' stocks on the 29th of this month (Thursday) saw a slight decline. Mercantile Bank fell by five shillings to seven pounds. Kaiping Mines shares fell by three pence to seventeen shillings and nine pence. Kulim Rubber Estates shares fell by seven and a half pence to seventeen shillings and six pence. The rest remained unchanged.

The London market prices for Chinese foreign debt on the 29th of this month (Thursday) saw continued rises in customs-secured bonds. The British-German continuation issue and the British-French issue rose by two pounds to fifty pounds. The Reorganization British-French issue rose by one and a half pounds to thirty-four pounds. The rest remained unchanged. The Reorganization market prices were thirty-four pounds for the British-French issue, thirty-two pounds for the French issue with stamps, and twenty-nine pounds for the German issue with stamps. There was a request to sell physical goods in London, totaling 1,500 pounds of the Reorganization German issue with stamps, with a selling price of twenty-nine and a half pounds. Another 1,500 pounds were transacted, with an opening price of twenty-nine pounds. The principal and interest due on the Reorganization bonds today, totaling 1,003,737 pounds, remain temporarily unpaid.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Trading Dominated by Speculation; Prices Rise Again by Four to Five Yuan; Japanese Yarn Adds Water to the Exchange Rate

The after-hours trading of cotton yarn remains ordinary, mostly speculative, and the market situation is still good. However, except for the continued purchases from Hong Kong and Yunnan merchants, there is little activity, mainly because transportation on all routes is blocked and delivery is extremely difficult. The spot market is calm, while general speculators are tight and unwilling to loosen their grip. The market opened this morning, continuing the momentum of the previous day and moving forward, but the rise was slow, with opening prices up by one or two yuan. The price of 20-count Behar yarn was 496 yuan, and the godown receipt price was 491 yuan. Shortly after, it rose by two yuan. At the same time, Hong Kong merchants had some demand, and those who profited from the high prices sold off, causing it to fall back by three yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 495 yuan, and the closing godown receipt price was 488 yuan. The afternoon opening saw a significant reduction in gatherings because the market would be closed for three days starting tomorrow along with the silver houses, reopening on July 4th. As a result, everyone was hesitant, but some still expected prices to rise, and the godown receipt price of Double Horse yarn was transacted at 491 yuan. The opening price for Behar Double Horse yarn was 498 yuan, also for immediate delivery, all belonging to speculative transactions. Only 20-count Shepherd yarn was transacted at 383 yuan, with a few dozen bales purchased by Guangbang merchants for immediate delivery. It is estimated that the total purchases by famous merchants throughout the day were less than 1,000 bales, with transactions among peers being the largest number. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by four yuan, Double Globe yarn rose by four yuan, Shepherd yarn rose by five yuan, and Five Blessings yarn rose by three yuan. Today, 240 bales of 10-count Ping Jian Yun export cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai, 100 bales to Tianjin, 1,140 bales to Hong Kong, 320 bales to Guangzhou Bay, 952 bales to Beihai, and 412 bales to Haiphong.

Japanese cotton yarn has always been difficult to purchase. Since the Ministry of Finance issued restrictions on withdrawals, the market is short of spot yarn. Most merchants dealing in Japanese yarn are in dire straits. According to the market, they have been negotiating with Japanese trading houses. Initially, the trading houses did not agree, but the Japanese factories, both domestic and foreign, recognizing the trend, changed their approach to avoid hindering sales. They now accept drafts with a premium. It is also said that these two factories will allow half of the yarn previously offered to be delivered through drafts and half through exchanges, a special offer that merchants are happy to accept. As a result, the Japanese yarn market was more active yesterday, but actual transactions were still flat. The spot price of 20-count Gekkin yarn was 392 yuan.

### Foreign Cotton Payment Issues: Trading Houses Agree to Handle Discretionally; Transactions Still Not Occurring

The foreign cotton market was weak from the start in New York due to the deteriorating European situation, leading to overseas selling. Many traders also closed out their positions. Washington has yet to announce definite plans for export subsidies, and silver has fallen by another cent, causing extreme discouragement. The cotton district's weather reports are quite good. As a result, New York fell by 23 points yesterday, while Indian cotton futures rose by one and a half rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose by five to six pounds.

The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has been quiet for many days. Yesterday was the last day for foreign exchange settlements in June. Demand for funds was quite tight in the morning. Although the critical time had passed by noon, credit conditions gradually eased. The Yarn Millers Association had convened a meeting the day before to listen to the trading houses' responses regarding payment issues for future arrivals, but no concrete and satisfactory answers were received. However, the trading houses agreed to handle the matter with discretion, which was a sign of concession.

Chinese and foreign cotton trade has completely stalled, but there are many disputes among the same traders buying and selling Indian cotton that was purchased earlier from trading houses. All of these issues stem from the Ministry of Finance's implementation of withdrawal restrictions. Previously, they had purchased from trading houses with a deposit of 20%, and if they could profit slightly, they would transfer it to another company, which in turn would sell it to another company. Recently, goods have arrived in Shanghai, but banks and money houses have no cash to provide, leading to numerous complications. Only 88 bales of Xasha cotton arrived at the dock. Today, 800 bales of export cotton are being shipped to Tianjin.

### Piece Goods: June Futures Being Settled

The cloth market is stable, and retailers continue to show willingness to sell off goods at lower prices, but traders' attitudes are still mostly calm. Yesterday, due to the end of the month, goods due for delivery this month were being settled, and shipments were very busy, but there was still no turnaround in sales, with only small amounts being transacted. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants purchased nearly 2,000 bolts of colored cloth, dyed materials, satin, printed cloth, and fine twill. Guangdong merchants from Mazhang purchased over 1,500 bolts of pongee, colored cloth, dyed materials, and printed cloth. Fujian and Quanzhou merchants purchased over thirty boxes of colored twill and colored cloth. Local wholesalers replenished their inventories with pongee, bleached cloth, and foreign yarn by over 1,000 bolts. There is still demand for autumn goods and woolens among various wholesalers, but there is selectivity. About twenty to thirty boxes of products from factories such as XXX were transacted. There was slight activity in Singapore for exports, with purchases of over 1,000 bolts of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill.

On July 1st, 60 bolts of piece goods were shipped to Yantai, 80 bolts to Hong Kong, 31 bolts to Guangzhou Bay, 11 bolts to Beihai, 310 bolts to Haiphong, and 140 bolts of native cloth came from Beisha on the 3rd.

### Wanliding Sells Well

Recently, the actual sales of woolens have increased, and prices have continued to rise sharply. Wanliding woolens are selling particularly well this summer, especially in sand and evergreen colors, which are very popular. Demand from Western tailors is extremely strong, and most of the inventories held by traders have been sold out. Gray and white are also in short supply, causing prices to rise sharply. Currently, the only available spot goods are inferior products from the Shin Weaving mill. First-grade Universal wool is being sold for 6.50 yuan, second-grade for 5.25 yuan, and third-grade for 4.40 yuan. British-made brands such as Changtai, Trade, Mason, and Xiankang are in high demand, and it is difficult to find them even at prices above 9 yuan. The original cost of Wanliding woolens was 3 shillings and 8 pence, which, based on the previous exchange rate of 8.25, would cost 6.30 yuan per yard. At the time, the selling price was 7.75 yuan, but now, based on the recent rate of 6.625, the cost is already 7.67 yuan.

### Grains: Wheat Market Prosperous; Factories Not Accepting Exchange Drafts; Flour Market Still Needs to Develop

The current flour market situation remains unchanged. Factories continue to offer 4.65 yuan in cash but have not accepted exchange drafts. Therefore, bulk sales are not expected to be active for the time being. However, local retail transactions have increased slightly due to slight stockpiling during the bank account closing holiday. Approximately 10,000 bags have been transacted, with a few scattered purchases from Northern and Southern merchants. It is rumored that returned goods have been sold at 5 yuan in exchange drafts, and miscellaneous brands have even been reduced, but these are not considered to be true market prices. Foreign flour trading has also been quiet. Holders believe that future supplies will be cut off and are unwilling to lower prices excessively, so they are maintaining their positions.

The new wheat market continues to improve. In terms of supply, besides carloads of wheat arriving daily from the Nanjing area, boatloads of wheat from Jiading are also continuing to arrive. Although the current demand from Chinese factories is weak, Japanese factories and local trading houses continue to purchase. The market is experiencing a limited supply, and trading houses are actively selling. Jiading wheat has reached 6.60 yuan, and Nanjing wheat is priced at 6.55 yuan. Over 400 bags have been transacted. Currently, production prices are firm and high, and the market is expected to continue to thrive.

In terms of exports, 37,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin, 1,800 bags to Xiangyu, and 13,000 bags to Quanzhou on July 1st. Additionally, 300 bags of wheat bran will be shipped to Xiangyu.

### Closing Accounts and Suspending Sales for Two Days: Japonica and Indica Rice Sales Active

The rice market announced yesterday that due to the closing of silver houses for account settlement for three days, the rice market will also suspend sales for two days on July 1st and 2nd. Afterwards, sales will be suspended every Sunday during the summer. Local shops are preparing in advance, so sales have suddenly become active. Furthermore, supplies from various sources are scarce, with only 1,600 to 1,700 bags of Changzhou car rice arriving. Sellers are raising prices, and major buyers are also taking the opportunity to increase their holdings, causing the market to rebound. As a result, prices of both thick and thin Japonica rice have increased by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan.

Interior Indica: Yesterday, purchases from interior villages and Funo increased because prices had fallen for several consecutive days, and transportation costs were reasonable. Additionally, sales would be suspended for two days, so merchants rushed to make purchases, with 2,600 to 2,700 bags being sent to interior villages and over 1,000 bags being sold locally. Market prices immediately rebounded by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, especially for white rice and Zhongguan rice. The prices of Du Yangjian and Bu Jian rice also followed suit, increasing by 0.20 yuan.

Foreign Rice: Both spot trading and new purchase contracts are quiet. However, foreign merchants continue to offer rice for sale. No. 1 Half rice is priced at 21.23 yuan, and No. 2 rice is priced at 20.034 yuan. However, grain merchants are uninterested because the price of rice shipped to Japan has fallen.

Glutinous Rice: Yesterday, Kui Yuan rice saw lackluster sales due to poor distribution channels and abundant foreign glutinous rice. The market atmosphere was ordinary, without significant gains or losses.

### Oilseed Cakes: Hankou Merchants Suddenly Purchase Soybean Oil; Afternoon Market Prices Soar; Market Closed Today

The momentum of crude soybean oil remains weak. Because today is Government Establishment Day and tomorrow is Sunday, there are two days of market closure, making transactions difficult. Prices have repeatedly fallen. However, the soybean oil market rebounded sharply in the afternoon due to sudden inquiries from Hankou in the Yangtze River region. The market sentiment soared, and soybean oil shipped from Kobe rose sharply from 40.60 yuan to 47 yuan, but only a small number of transactions occurred. The total market transactions were only 80 barrels. Overall, the market is constrained by the need to liquidate cash positions, but observing the underlying trend, there may be a rebound on Monday. Other transactions included 200 pieces of Yanjii soybean oil priced at 23.50 yuan, 100 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil at 32.90 yuan, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at 32.50 yuan, and 500 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil at 33 yuan.

In terms of exports, 100 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Xiangyu, 200 bags to Quanzhou, and 620 bags to Hong Kong. Soybean oil will be shipped to Quanzhou, and 200 catties of oilseed cakes will be shipped to Xiangyu, all on July 1st.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Prices Soar

According to yesterday's London report, nearby August futures rose sharply by 4.5 pence to 8 shillings and 6 pence. December futures rose by 1.75 pence to 6 shillings and 7.5 pence. March futures of the following year rose by 2.5 pence to 6 shillings and 8.25 pence. It is also reported that prices abroad have rebounded sharply, so the local guild raised prices. Spot 24-grade white sugar rose by 0.60 yuan, with local godown sugar at 29.80 yuan, foreign godown sugar at 29.60 yuan, port sugar at 0.70 to 0.80 yuan, and road sugar at 21.80 yuan. 200 bags were transacted. Customs godown sugar was at 21.50 yuan, with 400 bags transacted. Taikoo Snow White B Mark was at 29.70 yuan, with 100 bags of CW Mark at 29.50 yuan, both rising by 0.70 yuan. CX Mark was at 29 yuan, rising by 0.50 yuan. DY Mark was at 28.50 yuan, rising by 0.70 yuan. HX Mark was at 28.20 yuan, rising by 0.60 yuan. H Mark was also up by 0.40 yuan, with 100 bags transacted at 19.40 yuan. Spot Dutch red sugar rose by 0.70 yuan to 20.70 yuan, and re-export sugar rose by 1 yuan to 15 yuan, with 100 bags transacted. Local refined white sugar rose by 1 yuan, with Zhenji No. 1 at 29.50 yuan, No. 2 at 29 yuan, No. 3 at 28.50 yuan, and No. 4 at 28 yuan. National Sugar Diaoqing Chao Gang was at 16.50 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Guangzhou merchants offered over 100 bags of Huizhou white sugar, priced at 27.70 to 27.50 yuan.

### Metals: Copper Prices Increasing, Impacting Sales

Due to soaring prices, metal trading and sales are negatively affected. Copper products are not exempt from these effects. It is reported that only a small number of metals have been traded today.

The following shows copper products increasing:

Product Name  Source  Current Price Previous Price

Copper Ingot American 150.00 100.00

Copper Sheet Japanese 160.00 128.00

Copper Wire Japanese 158.00 128.00

Brass Plate Japanese 140.00 120.00

Brass Wire Japanese 140.00 120.00

Brass Bar Japanese 140.00 105.00

Copper Bar Japanese 150.00 120.00

### Angle Iron Rebounding

Before the recent price surge, angle iron sales were sluggish, with price increasing slower than other products. Recently, Tianjing, Qingdao and Yantai merchants are buying, which is raising prices.

Market prices:
1:00: 21 yuan
2:00: 19.5 yuan
2:30: 18 yuan
3:00: 18 yuan
Angle Iron is about 30 feet long, selling 7-800 bundles

### Coal: White Coal Expensive and Low Sales

White coal prices are increasing due to speculation. Transactions are not happening and the market is waiting. The price started at 3 yuan and then increased with a rapid rise in exchange rates. Prices are up about 10 yuan since last month.

Hongji White Coal: 50 yuan per tonne
Block: 57 yuan per tonne
Mid-Size Block: 55 yuan per tonne

The above numbers reflect internal discounts with fellow traders. Prices increase when delivered. Daily sales are less than 100 tonnes.

### Indian Coal Being Stockpiled

After the price increase, Indian coal has increased in sales and is in high demand. With the market booming, traders and speculators are stockpiling products. After-hours prices are surging.

One company is offering about 100 tonnes of coal at 48 yuan per tonne. Sales are difficult and those without stockpiles are losing money.

### Silk and Tea: Green Tea Rising

European businesses are buying more green tea with boats near the docks. Sales are excellent and there are many transactions.

Jinlong Yihua Baochang traded about 800 crates of green tea.
Ordinary: 278 yuan
Elite: 340 yuan
Prices increased 4 yuan.

Tea factories are buying raw materials to supply the needs of Western merchants.

### North and South Goods: Preserved Peaches Increasing

In the summer, peaches can easily spoil. Those with preserved peaches are storing them in cold-storage to keep them in good condition. The cost of course is increasing.

Cold stored: 65 yuan
Cold Stored Elite: 54 yuan
Ordinary: 45 yuan

Spring and Autumn

### A Letter from Nineteen Teachers: A Desperate Plea

Hoping investors establish consumer cooperatives and organize people's dining halls and people's dormitories

Editor:

We are all middle school teachers, and most of us have a monthly income of about 70 yuan. In terms of social status and monthly salary, although we are not as good as those above, we are still better off than those below. Most of us have parents, wives, and children. Since the war, the cost of living in Shanghai has been rising day by day, and it is really difficult to cope with the living expenses of a family of four or five people with an income of about 70 yuan. Just taking rent as an example, the average rent of our nineteen people is 25.4 yuan per month. Among them, one person is a sub-landlord, and three people still live in houses rented before the war. However, this amount has swallowed up more than one-third of our total income. However, we know that this is a very special period. The country is in trouble, and it is up to us to economize. Three of us still spend 3 yuan a month to support a refugee, and everyone still works hard to shoulder the burden of the family. But even more unfortunate things followed. As soon as the horses arrived in Shanghai, when we woke up the next day, it felt like we were in another world, and prices soared. Five days later, nineteen of us held a discussion meeting to discuss how to cope with future life: after calculating, everyone stared at each other, and future life would have to increase by at least 25% compared to the past! What should we do? We are willing to go to the interior, but how can we cope with our family? (Two single people have already decided to leave.) After everyone's discussion, we came up with a way. This method is not only for us, but it can also benefit most people, so we decided to write it down and send it to "Spring and Autumn" for everyone to discuss and promote together.

Consumer Cooperative: We thought of establishing a consumer cooperative for daily necessities. There is no better way to benefit us than a cooperative. According to our most honest estimates, at least one-fifth, or even more than one-fifth, of our monthly income of 70 yuan is exploited by profiteers and sub-landlords. At the same time, there is also a kind of pain, that is, prices change indefinitely. If rice is expensive, we spend five more yuan to buy rice, so there is no change left, and we can't afford to buy anything else. Who knows how much blood and sweat money the rice shop profiteers have earned from us! If someone establishes a cooperative and sells rice, because it is bought in bulk, the price is cheaper. At the same time, because the cooperative is established for the benefit of its own members, it will not manipulate prices, and at most it will charge a little handling fee for the staff, then we can really get a lot of discounts. This is just one example. Consumer cooperatives can also be established for firewood, charcoal, coal, oil, salt, etc. The establishment of this kind of organization can also cultivate the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual help, honesty, and dedication, and this spirit is precisely what is most lacking on the current isolated island.

Naturally, the source of funds is a problem, but we can ask wealthy compatriots or the banking community to invest. Rich people feel that they have money but nowhere to spend it, and they desperately do speculative business, especially the banking community. If we have legitimate uses and ask them to invest, it is not impossible. At the same time, our members can also invest shares. Although the amount paid by each person is not much, it is an integer when collected. We feel that restricting rice prices is only a passive way, and establishing consumer cooperatives is a proactive way. We should rely on our own strength to maintain our own lives!

We believe that every street hall, every large company, every university, and even your newspaper, can be used as a unit to establish this consumer cooperative. As long as it is beneficial, why should we be afraid that others will not join? Why should we be afraid that it will not be successful? We don't know much about the principles of cooperatives. The above is just a brief principle, or even a desperate request. We hope that people in the middle and lower classes can consider it more, participate in discussions, this is for our own benefit!

In addition to this, we have two more suggestions, one is a people's dining hall, and the other is a people's dormitory.

People's Dining Hall and People's Dormitory: If we have a large-scale people's dining hall and people's dormitory at present, we believe that we will definitely not lose money. We hope that people with spare money will set up people's dining halls and people's dormitories, and it is best for the two concession authorities to organize it themselves. We only need cleanliness and hygiene, and we don't ask for deliciousness and comfort. If this kind of dining hall and dormitory can be widely established, it will definitely be able to thrive and increase social welfare, which is called killing two birds with one stone.

We hope that speculative merchants whose conscience has not been obliterated will do less speculation that harms people, the country, and ultimately themselves. Don't just want to earn more. Earning more will be fatal and will cause suffering to many people. It is better to use the money for legitimate social undertakings so that everyone can share his kindness!

The above is our urgent appeal. The problem of people's livelihood in Shanghai is becoming more and more serious. This should be resolved immediately. Many people have become criminals of the country and nation due to the oppression of life. Many people are being forced to do illegal activities of robbery and plunder due to the oppression of life, and even more people are struggling hopelessly. Editor, are you willing to publish this letter of ours? If it can arouse a discussion and promote the attention of social figures and responsible authorities, and then start to establish and implement it, wouldn't it be of great help to the people, society, and even the country? Specially, I respectfully extend my greetings!

From Nineteen People

### "Little Princess" Impressions

— Bai Hua

“Little Princess” A Twentieth Century Fox Production

Since Shanghai became an "isolated island," bizarre phenomena have occurred in the sacred field of education, and these trends are continuing to worsen. This undesirable situation naturally arose with the war. However, for the education sector, which bears a significant mission, to compete with unscrupulous merchants who manipulate rice prices and raise rents is truly the greatest loss during the war.

Consider the many large, medium, and small schools that have relocated to the rear areas. They are unafraid of air raids; they build their own houses; and, in addition to studying, they actively participate in work in the rear. Each school and each student has become a powerful unit in the war of resistance. Shanghai's education sector should echo the rear areas. At the very least, it should educate for the sake of education. The cry of "Save the students!" should not fall on deaf ears.

Although the story of "Little Princess" revolves around the joys and sorrows of Shirley Temple and her father, it powerfully criticizes the corruption in education and the principal's use of the school as a tool for making money. For instance, because Shirley Temple is the daughter of an army captain, she receives preferential treatment upon entering the school. However, when the news of the captain's death arrives, the principal immediately reveals her snobbish face and throws Shirley Temple into the kitchen.

At the same time, we have seen orders to give special treatment to the families of soldiers. However, it must be solemnly stated that comparing the current situation in China with "Little Princess" is like missing by a hair and being off by a thousand miles because the British army's ordered expedition and China's war of resistance are inversely proportional. Nevertheless, this story can serve as a stark reminder to the "isolated island" education sector: many lives have been sacrificed for the country. What is your responsibility?

Shirley Temple fully displays her acting skills in this play. Especially in the two scenes of parting with her father and finally meeting him again, she can control the emotions of the tragedy, gradually building from faint to intense, reaching a climax. In the entire play, she also sweeps away the "accumulated habits" of the past and restores the innocence and liveliness of a child.

The director's achievements can be divided into the following four points: (1) In depicting Shirley Temple's transition from preferential treatment to servitude, he uses contrast: for example, when she arrives, the principal leads her to a magnificent room and forces another girl to leave so that Shirley can sit next to her; upon learning of the captain's death, the principal immediately disperses the companions celebrating Shirley's birthday, moves her to a small building, and punishes her with servitude. This not only strengthens the audience's sympathy for Shirley but also exposes the principal's snobbery. (2) In the two scenes of Shirley and her father parting and finally meeting, in the former, he uses Shirley suddenly running back from the window to hug the captain, and when he leaves, Shirley faces the window and only hears the sound of the door closing and the sound of horses' hooves. In the latter, Shirley misses her father twice and then suddenly meets him. The director has grasped the emotional atmosphere very firmly. (3) Shirley's dream is indeed a venting of the weak, but it can connect the Indian servant and Shirley Temple. There is reason for this. The union of the insulted and the injured is the most powerful group. (4) Because Shirley Temple can sing and dance, two short song and dance segments are inserted here, but they are all appropriate, especially when Shirley cannot find her father in the wounded soldier hospital.

Lee Kept Greene and Annie Tailor Hewes do not have many scenes.

Biographies of Female Storytellers (1)

Note: The earliest verifiable records of female storytellers can be found in Yunxian Bujisheng's "Record of Surnames of Lyric Talents." This book was completed around the fifth year of the Guangxu reign (1879) and published by the Shenbao Publishing House. Cai Erkan, the historian of melancholy, stated in "Supplement to the Shenbao Publishing House Catalog" (1879) regarding its content:

"This record specifically collects and records the surnames of female storytellers in Shanghai and includes poems, lyrics, and commentaries recorded over the years, which are categorized below. Since the opening of ports by sea, Shanghai's trade has flourished, surpassing all others in the world, and the realm of beauty and elegance is unparalleled. Among them are so-called writing rooms, long threes, and small twos, which are all types of prostitutes. The writing rooms consider themselves slightly superior, despising everything else. Therefore, refined gentlemen still enjoy talking about them...."

Unfortunately, although this book is mentioned in the "Supplement," it has not been found. According to the Master of the Wanqingxiang Liumengshi Studio's "Record of Dreams South of the Song," this book seems never to have been published. Volume Three of "Record of Dreams" states: "The 'Record of Surnames of Lyric Talents' by Zhu Zimei only describes brothels and has not been printed, making it difficult to pass down for long." The "Record of Dreams" was completed in the ninth year of the Guangxu reign (1883), four years after the "Supplement," so its statement is credible. Apart from the "Record of Surnames," there are no other books specifically recording female storytellers. Therefore, it is very difficult to investigate all the figures of female storytellers at that time today.

Wang Tao's "Ying Ruan Miscellany" (1874), Volume Five, contains a brief description of female storytellers at the time, which can be said to be the earliest available document about female storytellers and their characters today.

Its text says:

Pinghua (plain talk) began with Liu Jingting, but it was all done by men. In recent times, Cao Chunjiang and Ma Rufei are outstanding examples. Since the Daoguang and Xianfeng reigns, women have been admired for their beautiful voices and appearances, delicate flutes, and slender strings, capable of captivating listeners. In the past, they mostly performed in the Land God temples and Luo God temples in the city. At midday and early evening, they provided entertainment. Xu Yue'e and Wang Xueqing were famous for their beauty. After the war, they all moved outside the city. The best among them were Yuan Yunxian, Wu Suqing, Zhu Youxiang, Yu Cuie, Wu Liqin, all excellent. Those who have emerged since then include Zhu Liqing, Lu Cenxian, Chen Zhixiang, Jin Yuzhen, and Zhang Cuixia, whose language is elegant and surpasses their predecessors. Every time they appear on stage, the audience is captivated. Their voices are like a hundred warbling spring orioles, intoxicating and captivating the soul. When the song ends and the person leaves, one still feels the lingering sound around the marker. This is another new realm in the world of women. Someone composed a verse to give to them: "Jade desk leisurely chants new poems, golden house cannot hide the unwritten stele," is this still not the elegance of the boudoir? As for blind female storytellers, they are not accepted. With the loss of both eyes, they still sell their talent, which is a transformed image of hell.

Although the so-called "blind women" here were "not accepted" by Wang Tao, they were actually the main body of "female storytellers" before the Qianlong era. Historically, female storytelling started before the Qianlong era, especially when they lived in groups and became a "regular profession" after the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras. Li Jiarui's "On Storytelling" examined this and said:

From ancient times, those who have made a profession of storytelling have mostly been women. This trend already existed in the Ming Dynasty. The "Three Customs and Ten Faults" records that among the beggars in Changshu, there was a "grass head woman" who loved to play the flute, drums, and zither, was skilled in gambling, could compose poetry, was familiar with the Twenty-One Histories, and was proficient in storytelling. In the early Qing Dynasty, there was a Kunqu opera called "Female Storyteller," which narrated the story of a female storyteller. This must have been preceded by the popularity of female storytellers before such a story could be created.

### Eastern Ocean Unrest

In the southern part of Japan, military activity is rampant, causing the court to be anxious. The reason is that the gentlemen and people of the country have accumulated hatred with the country of Goryeo (Korea), and they request that the state send troops to punish them in order to quell the anger. The court fears that once military action is taken, it will be difficult to stop, and does not want to act lightly. The rebellious people are taking the opportunity to stir up trouble. What is worrying is that the rebels also have soldiers among their supporters. According to telegrams transmitted on Saturday, the rebels are leading a large army to Nagasaki, which is only twenty miles away. The Westerners residing in that port are all alarmed and are preparing to move. Officials such as consuls are also moving all their belongings into military ships because the rebels also hate Westerners. A British warship stationed in Shanghai has set sail and sped to Nagasaki. Later, those in Nagasaki who harbored secret intentions and acted as internal support were suppressed by local officials, and twenty-nine people were captured and immediately beheaded, so they have not yet reached the city.

### Melon Seeds Sales

The area of northern Shanghai originally belonged to graveyards. Since opening up to trade, it has been leased to foreign merchants, and it has gradually transformed from hills and huts to a prosperity that surpasses all others in the world. Not only is it difficult for various provinces and counties to catch up quickly, but also no other ports can compare. The sales of opium are calculated in the hundreds of millions every day. Even calculating the lamp oil in the opium dens, it requires fifteen baskets a day, each basket containing 360 catties, totaling 5,400 catties. And this does not include foreign candles, kerosene, and matches. Furthermore, considering watermelon seeds, the daily sales in tea houses, restaurants, brothels, and opium dens reach more than thirty stones (a unit of dry measure). During the first month of the year, sales reach as high as fifty stones. Who would have expected this? In addition, there is the practice of drinking with prostitutes, watching operas in carriages, and the numerous odd and useless items sold in the markets, with daily sales exceeding millions. The rumor that Shanghai is a pit of consumption is indeed true. Looking back at the past, one feels the vicissitudes of the world even more!

Random Notes by Artists

### Joy and Sorrow (1)

— Gu Lanjun

Writing about the experiences and feelings of working in the industry

In the minds of ordinary people, the filming life of movie actors is probably considered very pleasant and the most carefree. Some movie fans even harbor ardent wishes, yearning to make it their sole object in life. True, you only need to follow the director's instructions and act out certain actions and expressions. Isn't that easy? In reality, this is just a superficial observation without knowing the joys and sorrows involved. The actual situation is a very difficult job that is hard to put into words.

I started working in the film industry at the age of fifteen, and it has been almost seven years now. In these nearly seven years, I have acted in many films and experienced many tastes of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness. In short, the sweet component is indeed extremely small, while the bitter taste comes too often.

Here, I would like to write briefly about some of these filming experiences and feelings. But I also feel that this writing is even more difficult than filming because I rarely write and have never dared to try lightly. Fortunately, even if I have to revise it repeatedly, it is much easier than filming many NG shots on the set!

The film set is like a big opera cabinet, and working on the film set is really troublesome, especially in this scorching summer heat. This place is like a huge iron cabinet. To isolate external noise and avoid interfering with the sound recording work, the periphery of the set is built as strong and thick as steel walls and iron walls, and soundproofing boards are added, and many blankets are hung to reduce reverberation and echo. Before the director's command to "Camera!" is shouted, all the doors in and out are closed tightly to prevent ventilation, and the lights above, below, left, and right emit extremely strong light, all focused on the actors, intensely illuminating them. "Try it once," "Try it again." After repeated practice under the director's command, formal filming can begin. Working all night in such a hot and unbearable situation, the sweat beads on the body pour down like rain, and the light burns and hurts the skin. Only oneself knows and cannot tell this suffering. As for the viewing on the screen, on average, after working hard all night, the result that can be shown to the audience is probably less than twenty minutes!

A few days ago, my older sister, Meijun, bought a light gray handbag. My sisters and I were filming "Lan Lan's Flying Corpse." She took this handbag to the film set. Who knew that in less than two days, it was completely disfigured by the light, and the original light gray color quickly turned into a light red hue. When my older sister Meijun made this surprising discovery, she rushed to show it to me and expressed deep regret. I couldn't help but feel a sense of sorrow that "even objects are like this," and I was almost in a daze and almost shed tears.

### Has Stalin seen our play?

Our entire group also had a girl sent to be our guide. When we acted alone, or when we had difficulty buying things due to language barriers, often among the passers-by, a Russian who spoke Chinese well would step out. He would act as a volunteer translator to solve our difficulties. Who was he? How could we encounter such a coincidence?

Once, I was shopping in a store. A female clerk pointed to the gold ring I was wearing and asked me in fluent English: "What is this? What is it for?" I replied: "This is my wedding ring, in memory of my wife." Unexpectedly, she asked me: "Please discard it immediately!" I asked her in surprise: "What is the reason?" She said: "The love between a man and a woman is 'natural' and 'pure.' The union of two hearts only requires mutual affection. To think that at the beginning of a marriage, one must rely on this dirty gold as a connection for the love between two people is already unnatural and impure! Moreover, it already implies a sign of rupture in advance, so I advise you to discard it!" After hearing this little clerk's remarks, I felt that they were quite insightful. Unfortunately, I still failed to part with the ring and discard it! It wasn't because I was stingy and reluctant to give up this mere gold, because this ring was not a memorial to my marriage, but a souvenir brought to me from Paris, France, by my first lover. Although she has already left and has a husband, I see her in my mind and always wear it on my finger, until the time I write this article.

Soviet girls possess both a healthy physique and a sincere passion. When Mr. Mei performed on stage, women in the audience often shouted, "Mei Lanfang! I love you!" (This has also happened in the United States.) Especially on the last night of the public performance at the Moscow National Academy, after the play ended, the audience refused to leave their seats, and the curtain rose and fell more than ten times. After a girl shouted, "Mei Lanfang, I love you!" she presented a bouquet of flowers on stage to Mr. Mei. Who was she? She was the daughter of Litvinov, the Soviet Foreign Minister who had recently been dismissed.

After our performance in Moscow, we went to Leningrad for a public performance, which ended on the morning of April 12. We returned to Moscow to board the train back to China, but the experience of the Soviet National Theatre Bolshoi Theatre suddenly requested: Be sure to give a final performance at the National Theatre. It is said that it was because some senior government officials wanted to see the magic of Chinese opera.

### The Pu Yu Sisters Go to Zhongnan

— Lianlu

The Pu Yu Society's male and female storytellers, who have been absent for a long time, will be performing day and night at the Zhongnan Storytelling Theater again starting on July 4. What good news this is for Shanghai storytelling fans! Speaking of the Pu Yu Society, we cannot help but think of the Zhongnan Storytelling Theater, which has a historical connection with the society. The Pu Yu Society has its current status, on the one hand, it is certainly due to the efforts of the members to cater to the needs of the audience, and on the other hand, it can also be said that it was because of the support of the theater in the past that they were able to succeed today.

This time, the performance time of the Pu Yu Society at the Zhongnan Storytelling Theater is 2:30 p.m. for the day performance and 8:15 p.m. to 11:15 p.m. for the night performance. At the same time, the theater manager, Mr. Li Wencai, has requested the opening piece writer, Mr. Ni Gaofeng, to perform his new work, "Duet Opening Piece," at the theater successively. The thousands of listeners who have heard Mr. Ni's opening pieces such as "Farewell My Concubine" and "Lady Sun's Sacrifice to the River"... on this day, I think there will be an even bigger sensation. As for the performers, there are Chen Rong: Wang Jiayu, Wang Lanyun, Wang Meiyun, "Gold-Plated Phoenix," Zhou Juxian "Double Continuous Evasion," He Yunfang, He Qinfang, "Double Pearl Ball," Chen Yaxian, Chen Meixian, "Mao Family Book," Xie Letian, Xie Xiaotian, Xie Fengtian, "Jade Dragonfly," "White Snake Legend." The seat price is popular, only selling for one and a half corners, and it also includes fragrant tea.

Today's manuscript is crowded, "Outside Records of the Pear Garden" will be suspended for one day, and will be continued in the next issue.

(6) Comedy

Two people talk and sing unrestrainedly, with the main purpose of amusing people, this is what is called "comedy."

Not meaning to beat a dead horse, mentioning "comedy," one cannot help but think of Wang Wu Neng and the feeling of "the dead are gone, who will follow?" He is broad in the stomach, has many plays, is familiar with dialects from all over the place, and singing comedy is like driving a light car on a familiar road.

Although the way of "comedy" is small, there are also "skills" in it, and it cannot be said that "indiscriminately releasing low-level gags" is the extent of its ability!

Shadows of the Dance World (29)

### Star Six Star Records Two—Ye Peishan

After the Tianjin incident, which caused a great uproar, many people fled from there to Shanghai. The person mentioned in this article also sent a letter to her companions yesterday, saying that she would be back soon. In fact, although the British and French concessions in Tianjin have been blockaded, as for whether Shanghai is safe, I am afraid it is only a difference of fifty steps compared to a hundred. Why does she need to come back? However, (29) that is not the case. According to her letter, she was a dance partner at a Xianle Dance Hall in Tianjin. Now that the dance hall has been closed, without saying, her dance ticket income is gone. Besides, her parents are now in Shanghai, so even if the Tianjin concession is not blockaded, she should come back. Then again, if the Tianjin concession were not blockaded, the Xianle Dance Hall would not have closed down. So her return can also be regarded as affected by the Tianjin incident.

She is a sixteen-year-old girl, and she is quite tall. She has a round face, like the Mid-Autumn Festival moon, a pair of black and bright eyes, like two stars, a very straight nose, a mouth that is neither too big nor too small, and teeth like shattered jade. When she speaks, she reveals two shallow dimples. Her breasts are well-developed, and her muscles are also very strong. Although her skin is not very delicate, overall, she can be called healthy and beautiful. I think this is very much to the liking of northerners. She usually doesn't talk much, and when she sees strangers, she doesn't say a word. Some people say that she is innocent, but unfortunately, she lacks liveliness. Don't say that. If you are familiar with her, she will also talk and laugh like everyone else, and her liveliness will be great. She used to be a dance partner at the Metropolis for a long time, sitting opposite Li Mingzhu. Whether she will go to the dance hall again this time, which dance hall she will go to, we will have to wait and see.

When she was going to Tianjin, a companion wanted to give her a farewell party and pulled me to be the escort. Needless to say, the escort was a formality, and the real thing was to collect money. Coincidentally, a friend wanted to invite me to dinner that day, so I explained the farewell party to him and dipped some tea on the table with my finger and wrote "Willing" and "Unwilling" in two lines. I said, if you are willing to treat, then erase "Unwilling." If you are unwilling, then erase "Willing." He said, "You are really something. You are committing a play from the dancing hall. Since you are going to He Yupai, why should I temporarily play Zhang Jinfeng? But today, the male becomes female, and the female becomes male." Saying that, he casually wiped away the word "Un" and it became "Willing" "Willing." I said, why do you need two "Willing"? He said, "In principle, you need four "Willing." Peishan has someone to give her a farewell party, of course, she is "Willing." Her companion has you doing errands for her, naturally she is also "Willing." As for you, you found this scapegoat, and you occupy two spots in face. Needless to mention Miss Geng, of course, she is "Willing." As for me, usually buying a dance ticket of ten or twenty yuan and inviting them to have dinner with me, I may not be able to invite them. Today, I don't spend a penny, and after they finish eating, they have to thank me, wouldn't that be even more "Willing"? But it's too cheap for you." After dinner, we sent Ye Peishan home, upstairs in a newly opened paper shop, the place is small, the people are noisy, and the weather is so hot, young girl, how can you live here?
