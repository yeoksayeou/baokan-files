### Repeated Fierce Counterattacks by Chinese Troops: Japanese Encirclement Plan in Central Hubei Fails; Over 20,000 Japanese Troops Annihilated in Mountainous Area; Chinese Troops Attack Tianmen from Both Sides, Capturing Northeastern Heights; No Sign of Japanese Troops South of the Dia River and in Xinye, Southern Henan

Fancheng. The war situation in northern Hubei has suddenly become tense in recent days. At the beginning of the month, the Japanese army transferred a division of troops from Wuchang and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, together with the original garrison, totaling more than four divisions, and attacked northern Hubei in three routes. One division attacked near Zhongxiang from the right flank, and another division attacked Dahong Mountain and Suixian from the central route, leading to fierce battles with the Chinese army everywhere. More than 5,000 Japanese troops were annihilated by the Chinese army at Yinjia Stone, east of Suixian; more than 4,000 were annihilated at Lishan; more than 5,000 were annihilated at Shangjiadian; and more than 1,000 were annihilated near Dahong Mountain. The Japanese army left corpses all over the mountains and fields in this mountainous area, and the Xianghua Road was littered with dead and wounded, making it impossible for vehicles to pass, indicating the severity of their casualties. The Japanese army encountered attacks everywhere in this area, and its offensive became weak. The Japanese side then organized a rapid force of a brigade of cavalry, totaling about 2,000 men in two regiments, and fled north to Xinye. Upon reaching Xinye, they turned their main force eastward and attacked Tanghe. At this time, the Chinese army's strength in this area was slightly weak, and Xinye was lost on the 10th and Tanghe on the 13th. Later, the Chinese army from Nanyang rushed to support them day and night. The Japanese army penetrated deep into the territory alone and was severely attacked by the Chinese army. Its main cavalry force was defeated by the Chinese army, and more than 1,000 Japanese troops were killed in the Battle of Xinye. After the defeat, the Japanese army retreated from Tanghe in a panic and fled back to the southeast. The Chinese army then recovered Xinye on the 11th and Tanghe on the 14th, thus stabilizing the war situation. Now, the Chinese army is crossing the river to counterattack Zhongxiang on one side, and attacking from Wayang on the other, recapturing Hansi and Wamiaoji, and recently recovering Yuekou, pressing towards Zaoshi. The Chinese army is taking advantage of the situation to attack, and the situation is quite favorable. The Japanese army's strategy in the battle of northern Hubei was to adopt an outward offensive posture, attempting to encircle from both flanks to achieve the goal of annihilating the main force of the Chinese army. However, the Chinese army, relying on the terrain, adopted an inward offensive strategy and put up a strong resistance. As a result, the Japanese army not only failed to complete its encirclement plan, but also suffered repeated counterattacks from the Chinese army and suffered heavy losses. According to the Japanese Tokyo broadcast, the purpose of the invasion of northern Hubei was to search for and annihilate the main force of the Chinese army, and then to destroy the Chinese operational base. However, so far, the facts show that the Japanese army in northern Hubei has not only failed to annihilate the main force of the Chinese army, but also failed to shake the Chinese base. (17th dispatch)

(Yichang) The Chinese army besieged Jiukou and captured Zhengjiaqiao on the 16th. The Japanese army's rear route in Jiukou has been cut off by the Chinese army, and the Chinese army is continuing to besiege. Jiuzhenmiao Heights, an important stronghold northeast of Tianmen, was also recaptured by the Chinese army, and a pincer attack has been launched against the Japanese army in Tianmen City. The Japanese army's momentum has become exhausted, and the situation in central Hubei will be more favorable to the Chinese army. (17th dispatch)

(Changsha) The cold rain in northern Hunan made the front line quiet again before the 17th. It is reported that the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi and southern Hubei suffered heavy casualties after being attacked by the Chinese army day and night in Wuning. (17th dispatch)

(Chongqing) Recently, the Japanese side has repeatedly broadcasted that it has encircled more than 20 divisions of the Chinese army, totaling 150,000 people, near Zaoyang and has annihilated them. When asked to the military authorities here, they all laughed and said that the Chinese army has been adopting its consistent strategy of protracted attrition warfare, avoiding decisive battles with the Japanese army. Therefore, the Chinese army has retreated in advance according to the opportunity of this so-called Japanese encirclement operation. Even the local people have mostly moved away in advance. There is no one in the encirclement. Therefore, if reporters stationed in Shanghai and Tokyo ask the Japanese military spokesman about the results of the Japanese army's victory in this encirclement, how many prisoners were captured, and how many war trophies were obtained, then even the most deceitful Japanese military spokesman will have nothing to say. Moreover, after the Japanese army advanced north from ×× place to ×× place, they were fiercely attacked head-on by the Chinese Tang army group from north to south, and the Japanese army collapsed and fled south. ×× place was outside the Japanese encirclement. Why did the Japanese broadcast say that it was narrowing the encirclement? Although the Japanese army repeatedly said that Tang Enbo's army had been encircled and annihilated, may I ask what army inflicted a painful blow on the Japanese army in ×× place? And may I ask why the Japanese army, which won the victory on the Huayuan Xiangfan Road, abandoned its countless wounded soldiers along the way and did not take care of them? Generally, the grass, trees, houses that cannot be moved in Tongbai Mountain and Dahong Mountain must have been encircled by the Japanese army and unable to resist. It is found that in this battle in the area east of Xiangfan, the Japanese army suffered more than 20,000 casualties, which is more than the Chinese army. (17th dispatch)

(Hong Kong) A Chongqing dispatch states that the Japanese army invading central Hubei consists of three divisions in total. Two divisions and a cavalry brigade attacked north along the Hanyi Road, and one division attacked along the Huaxiang Road to the left flank, fighting a bloody battle with the Chinese army. Since a Chinese army commander led his troops across the river and attacked north, he has captured a large number of enemies for days. Yesterday, at Haozigang Tianjiaji, the two routes defeated 3,000 Japanese troops, killing more than 1,000 Japanese troops, capturing a large number of weapons, horses, military supplies, documents, and capturing a Japanese officer, Brigade Officer Ijii. In the vicinity of Wuning and north of Gaoan in Jiangxi Province, the Chinese and Japanese armies are still facing each other. The war situation on the banks of the Gan River and the Fu River is quiet. (17th special dispatch)

Japanese troops south of the Dia River and in Xinye have disappeared. A small number of Japanese troops at Chengjiahe Jiadang (southwest of Cangtai) also fled towards Zaoyang on the 16th. There is also no sign of the Japanese army within 30 miles east of Shuanggou (western Hubei). A certain unit of the Chinese army has already launched a pincer attack against the Japanese army in the area since the 16th. It is also heard that the Japanese army in Xinyang has completed the repair of the Yangtaiguan Bridge and declared that it will invade Minggang. (17th dispatch)

Editorial

### The Future of the Anglo-Soviet Rapprochement and the Anti-Aggression Group Movement

The European anti-aggression group organization movement, which has been going on for a long time, has indeed achieved considerable success since Britain provided guarantees to Poland, Romania, Greece, etc., and concluded an agreement with Turkey. The only flaw is that the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have the greatest capacity to stabilize the international situation, but unfortunately, the unity of the two countries has not achieved satisfactory results after a long period of consultation. Now, the negotiations between the two countries seem to have reached the final stage: According to the telegram carried by this newspaper yesterday, the Soviet Union sent a note to Britain on the 15th, replying to the counterproposal submitted by Britain at the beginning of the month, requesting to conclude a mutual assistance agreement with Britain and France, granting guarantees to Poland, Romania, and other neighbors of the Soviet Union, and immediately begin consultations on various military measures. At the same time, it is also rumored that the British government intends to submit a new counterproposal to the Soviet Union immediately, which will be sent to the Soviet Union within 48 hours. The content of the new counterproposal includes the following points: (1) The United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union issue a joint declaration, stating their determination to prevent future aggression within Europe; (2) The Soviet Union grants guarantees to its neighbors; (3) If the Soviet Union suffers aggression as a result of implementing this guarantee, the United Kingdom and France will provide assistance; (4) The United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union agree on various practical military strategies, so that in the event of an incident, the existing agreements can be quickly implemented. The main points of the proposal are roughly the same as the Soviet Union's requirements; therefore, the completion of the anti-aggression group organization can be realized in the shortest period.

In the past, the reason why the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union could not agree on the organization of an anti-aggression group was of course very complicated: the political situation in the United Kingdom and the attitudes of the Soviet Union's neighbors all had considerable relations; but the most important thing was that the United Kingdom was constrained by the Far East problem. Although Britain has adopted tough countermeasures against general aggressor countries in Europe, it has not yet publicly abandoned its attempts to compromise with Japan in Asia. Therefore, when Britain and the Soviet Union began consultations, the Soviet Union advocated that the Far East should be included in the scope of the anti-aggression group; while Britain hoped that Japan would break away from the German-Italian axis and instead advised the Soviet Union to abandon this suggestion. Later, Japan repeatedly claimed that it would not join the German-Italian military alliance, implying that Britain should not cooperate with the Soviet Union; making Britain unwilling to actively get close to the Soviet Union.

Recently, due to the intensification of the collusion of European aggression forces, the delay in organizing an anti-aggression group has almost made people pessimistic about the future of democratic countries. In addition, Britain's fantasy about the Far East has been ridiculed by facts. When the Anglo-Soviet consultation is about to reach the final stage, Gulangyu has fallen, and Shanghai will be subjected to so-called surgery; at the same time, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita delivered a speech, saying that Japan must not ignore Britain's and the Soviet Union's cooperation in Europe or the Far East, believing that it is necessary to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact. Under these circumstances, will Britain compromise and hesitate, or will Britain and the Soviet Union catch up and strengthen unity? This is a question of two possibilities.

According to the current situation, the opinions of Britain and the Soviet Union have become closer, and with France's mediation, the conclusion of the Anglo-French-Soviet agreement may be a matter of time. The big problem that remains is whether the completion of the European anti-aggression group can prevent the world's aggression from acting. In our view, the European situation may be temporarily缓和 by the anti-aggression group, but it is by no means a fundamental solution. Even if the security and peace of Europe can be緩弛 by the completion of the anti-aggression group organization, what is not enough to affect the security and peace of Europe through aggressive actions outside Europe? In other words, the aggression凶鋒敛迹 in Europe, but发挥 it in East Asia; making the European democratic country stand in East Asia, and East Asia becomes the гнездо of aggression and becomes the resource of aggression; has the aggressive feather already 풍, still 敛迹 in Europe? At that time, will the European democratic country cherishing brooms and embracing 잔수 안전 and peace still be able to maintain: "Security is collective, and peace is indivisible." Therefore, the world's general peace-loving countries should unite and organize a world anti-aggression group, of course including China, this is a permanent solution!

### Japan's Demands on Gulangyu Rejected by the Municipal Council; British Ambassador to Japan Klatch Protests to Japan; Cabinet Considering Sending Troops to Land to Protect Overseas Chinese; Naval Fleet Commander Nobel Arrives in Xiamen Yesterday

(Tokyo) The Counsellor of the British Embassy here, Tweed, delivered to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs last night the British government's formal protest against the Japanese army's occupation of Gulangyu. British Ambassador Klatch was slightly indisposed and remained in bed, so Tweed delivered the protest on his behalf. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

(Hong Kong) According to Japanese sources from Xiamen, some of the Japanese army troops have withdrawn from Gulangyu and have stopped searching for unstable elements. The five demands made by the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen to Moorehouse, the Chief Executive Officer of the Gulangyu Municipal Council, on May 14, were rejected by the Council after an emergency meeting on Monday, and the replies are as follows: (1) The crackdown on anti-Japanese elements has already been implemented; (2) Moorehouse has not committed any dereliction of duty, so the request to replace his position with a Japanese person cannot be accepted; (3) The right to elect Taiwanese overseas Chinese conflicts with the land regulations. To amend the land regulations, it must be handled by the consular corps; (4) The Chinese official who has the right to recommend Chinese directors to the Municipal Council according to the land regulations has already left office. The selection of candidates to fill the three vacancies of the Chinese directors must be handled by the consular corps; (5) The Gulangyu Police Department and the Japanese Consulate Police have already jointly searched for suspects. The Municipal Council made引并对. According to Japanese sources, as a result of the cooperation between the Japanese Marines and the Japanese Consulate Police, suspects of anti-Japanese terrorists have been arrested. The Marines have now been reduced to the minimum number, and most of them have withdrawn from the public concession of Gulangyu Island. The Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, Nobel, arrived in Xiamen this morning on the flagship Birmingham, accompanied by a destroyer. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

(Tokyo) As a result of a special meeting held by the Gulangyu Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday, it was decided to reject the demands made by the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen on the 13th of this month regarding the reorganization of the Gulangyu Municipal Council and the control of anti-Japanese elements. The Council's reply stated that the control of "terrorists" has been intensified recently. As for the Japanese request that a Japanese be appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Municipal Council and that the Japanese Chief of Police should participate in the meetings of the Municipal Council, it is difficult to comply with these requests. In addition, regarding the Japanese immigration from Taiwan, these Taiwanese immigrants do not have the right to vote. As for the amendment of the current regulations and the Japanese request to fill the three vacancies of the Chinese directors who recently left office with Japanese people, the consular corps must discuss the matter. The Municipal Council has no right to decide. (17th dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to消息 received here, the Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, Nobel, arrived in Xiamen today on the British battleship "Birmingham", with two destroyers accompanying him. Nobel's arrival in Xiamen must be related to the Japanese army's occupation of Gulangyu. (Haitong dispatch on the 17th)

(London) It is rumored that Admiral Nobel, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, arrived in Xiamen and submitted an Aide-mémoire requesting that his country's Marines immediately withdraw from Gulangyu Island to land and protect his country's interests. No decision has yet been made on this. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)

(London) The British government considered a plan to send the navy to land on Gulangyu last night. Political figures strongly stated that Britain will never tolerate Japan landing on the Gulangyu Concession, fearing that if this matter is kept silent, Japan will intensify and occupy other public concessions in China. Therefore, London is currently consulting with Washington about this matter, hoping to take joint action. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 17th)

### Military Commission Announces One Week of Battle Results

May 8th to 14th

Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Commission stated that since the recent offensives by Chinese troops on all fronts, with the speed of a whirlwind, have successively recovered lost territory, creating a completely new and favorable situation for the entire north-south battlefield. The Japanese army, in a state of panic, has been desperately trying to regroup its defeated forces this week. However, under the fierce attacks of the Chinese army, they have suffered huge losses. The main battle results are as follows:

Hubei Front

The Japanese "Fujiyama" and Xuezhou Fujiyama units in Hubei Province have concentrated their full strength since last week, launching a large-scale offensive with combined land and air forces. By employing mobile tactics, the Chinese forces lured the Japanese army into the mountainous area of Suizao in northern Hubei, completing an encirclement. This week, a major annihilation battle was launched. At Tumenchong and Yinjia Dian, over 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. Near Liujia River, over 1,500 Japanese soldiers were killed. On the left side of Qingshan Town, over 3,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. In the Liangjiashan battle, over 1,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. Facing Xinjie Wanjiashan, over 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. In total, over 13,800 Japanese soldiers were killed, and countless weapons and military supplies were seized. At the same time, in central Hubei, the Chinese forces successively captured key locations such as Huanjia Dong, Huangmenkou, Tai Liwan, and Wamiaoji, cutting off the enemy's rear. In southern Hubei, Xianning Jianlou was captured once, and Tongcheng was captured twice. In eastern Hubei, Echeng Gedian was captured. Near Hankou, the Chinese forces once captured Tuoluo and destroyed key roads and transportation routes in the vicinity, burning a large amount of Japanese military vehicles and supplies. The remaining and defeated Japanese army is on alert day and night, without a moment's rest.

Northern Jiangxi Front

The various units of the Chinese army advancing towards Nanchang continued their pursuit this week. On the 8th, Shajing Niuxing was captured. Although the Japanese army reinforced and counterattacked, they were all repulsed. At dawn on the 11th, the Chinese forces stormed into the city, leading to fierce street fighting. The Japanese army resisted desperately, but were killed in countless numbers by the Chinese army. After burning military ammunition, gasoline warehouses, and barracks, the Chinese forces withdrew. Nanchang is under tight encirclement. On the evening of the 11th, Hushan, north of Anyi city, was captured. The battle to capture the city is in full swing. The Japanese army between Wuning Daqiao and Hejian has been severely attacked for three days, with over 600 Japanese casualties. The battle situation is gradually calming down. On the 8th and 9th, a part of the elite Chinese army adopted ingenious tactics to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Pengze, in order to provide support. After two days of bloody fighting, the two key points of Xuanshan and Yangjiashan were successively captured, forcing the Japanese army in Nanchang, Wuning, Fengxin, and Anyi to be caught off guard and panic.

Guangdong Front

The Chinese forces traversing the outskirts of Guangzhou launched a fierce offensive against the Japanese army trapped in the city this week, with a rapid encirclement and swift action. The Japanese army resisted stubbornly in separate groups, suffering heavy casualties. The Japanese army in Zengcheng advanced towards Xiaolou on the 9th, but were met with a head-on attack. The Japanese army abandoned over 200 corpses and fled. All the highway bridges between Zengcheng and Conghua were thoroughly destroyed, cutting off the Japanese army's communication. Another surprise force captured Fuhe, annihilating all 300 of the defending Japanese soldiers. As for the Japanese army in Xinhui and Jiangmen, they were besieged on three sides by the Chinese army and local militia on the morning of the 11th. The Japanese army resisted relying on fortifications. After a fierce battle until noon, they abandoned the city and fled, and it was recaptured. Furthermore, over 500 Japanese soldiers in Jiujiang harassed Yangcun from Xinan Town on the 10th, encountering the Chinese army's attacking forces. After a fierce battle of three hours, the Japanese army abandoned over 200 corpses and retreated. They were pursued, and many were captured.

Henan Front

The Chinese army, which had recaptured Meng County in northern Henan, took advantage of the victory to attack Wen County for days, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese army on the outskirts of the city, resulting in significant gains. On the 9th, the Japanese army in the city attempted to break out through the north gate, but failed. The encirclement and annihilation continue. The transportation along the Daqing Railway is now completely controlled. As for the remaining Japanese army in Xinyang in southern Henan, although they repeatedly attempted to break through towards Zhengzhou, they never managed to cross the You River. Their forces are exhausted. In Xinye and Tongbai, since the 10th, Japanese soldiers have adventurously ventured deep into the area to attack. Chinese officers and soldiers displayed their prowess, encircling the Japanese army and launching a full-scale offensive. In the battle of Xinye, over 1,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. In the battle of Tanghe, 900 Japanese soldiers were killed. Both county towns were lost and regained, greatly boosting morale. The Japanese army harassing the outskirts of Tongbai was engaged in a fierce battle for 14 days. Countless Japanese soldiers were killed by the Chinese army's fierce artillery fire. Their attempt to attack the Chinese flank in coordination with the Japanese army in northern Hubei was completely shattered by this strong blow. In addition

Northern Jiangsu Front

Sheyang County was recaptured. In Anhui Province, the Chinese forces charged into Anqing and besieged Qingyang. In Suiyuan, Dachen Fort was captured. In western Shanxi, the Chinese forces reached the outskirts of Lishi City. In Shandong Province, Linquan and Feixian were successively captured. Because of the complete victory of the Chinese army on all fronts, the puppet troops in various places seized the opportunity to defect and jointly resist Japan. Their numbers are increasing constantly. Important examples include the Suiyuan Security Corps led by Qiao Richeng, with over 1,300 men, the Yongji puppet Imperial Army led by Xu Huapeng, with over 500 men, the Linjin puppet Imperial Army led by Fan Dingbang, with over 800 men, the Hong County puppet National Salvation Army led by Liu Yuchun, with over 200 men, and the Jixian puppet Autonomous Army led by Li Zhonglin, with over 300 men, totaling no less than 3,000 men. This is causing the Japanese army's treacherous plot of using Chinese to control Chinese to fail increasingly. These are all significant battle results of the past week and are particularly worthy of reporting. (16th dispatch)

### Key Points of the National Production Conference Declaration

(Chongqing) The National Production Conference issued a declaration with the following key points: The promotion of China's economic construction has been underway for decades, but the results have not been significant. There are two main reasons for this: First, before the establishment of the National Government, although there was construction, there was no plan. Second, after the establishment of the National Government, although there was a plan, it was hampered by internal and external troubles, and no significant progress could be made.

Now that the War of Resistance has begun, the country is unified, internal troubles have been eliminated, and the foreign invaders are mired in difficulties, China's economic policy should be based on the Three Principles of the People, with the aim of solving the normal needs of national production. In particular, it is necessary to develop state capital, support private enterprises, and promote cooperative movements, while preventing the concentration of capital and nationalizing production enterprises, in order to lay the foundation for the construction of a new China and cultivate the foundation of the entire nation. Resistance against Japan and saving the country is a matter of life and death. The government should plan the entire national productive forces based on the principles of military first, victory first, state above all, and nation above all, so that various military necessities can be produced in large quantities and continuously, to meet the needs of national defense and strengthen the strength of resistance. Regarding the types and quality of products, there should be an overall calculation, and there must be a close connection between various production enterprises, so that the entire national economic production becomes a systematic and organized mobile whole. Based on the hinterland of the southwest and northwest, the economic construction of the rear is an urgent task. Before the war, the economic center of the country was in the east. In the years after the war, the economic center of the country will be in the west. Therefore, the economic construction of the rear today must be based on planned calculations. The participants of this conference believe that the entire national production policy, with the economic construction of the southwest and northwest as the center, should be recognized by the entire country. (17th dispatch)

### Premier Kong's Opening Speech

(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) And improve production institutions, such as handicrafts, home industry, rural sideline occupations etc., by referring to modern academic theory, in order to improve its efficiency, so that theory and method match, career and environment adapt, new and old coordinate, and help for use. Our country has a vast territory and a large population. Although there are now strong men recruited into the army, women, children, and the elderly can work hard, and the physique of women is also most suitable for this type of work. If we can find ways to transfer and engage them in production, it will greatly benefit the strengthening of the power of resistance. (4) The training of production talents, as the saying goes "it takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to nurture people." The development of all careers depends on the promotion of manpower, so training talents is the basic work for promoting future production. I have spared no effort in advocating production education. I usually feel that school education in recent years has been too focused on theory. The state spends huge amounts of money to establish higher education, but the talents cultivated mostly cannot engage in actual production careers. This is really a waste. I think that at present, there is a great need for high-level technical talents, but the number of people needed is limited and easy to maintain. The most lacking are skilled workers, because this kind of talent is the backbone of the production business. The economic wealth of all industrially advanced countries is based on a large number of technical jobs. Before the European War, France's wealth was an important part of this. After the war, the rapid revival was also the same. Without skilled workers, even if there is perfect equipment, it will inevitably be wasted and reduced due to ineffective use. In addition to instilling academic theory, vocational schools should be set up to emphasize practice, so that schools and businesses are integrated, theory and practice are mutually linked, young people have no fear of unemployment, and society does not feel a lack of talent. Construction and revival can only be achieved. The above are just general outlines. All the gentlemen present, or the heads of various production agencies, or well-known domestic experts, will be able to list items based on their usual research knowledge and experience, and conduct careful research to contribute to the country. Chiang Kai-shek said, "The victory of the War of Resistance must be achieved by eliminating waste of people, waste of materials, waste of land, and waste of time in order to achieve such a goal. It must also start from developing the economy of the rear, increasing agriculture and production, and vigorously promoting industry." At this stage of the War of Resistance, politics is more important than military affairs, the rear is more important than the front, and production and construction are the most important work in the rear. The responsibility you bear today is as great as that of the soldiers fighting on the front lines. It is fully demonstrated that I have come here from afar to attend the meeting, and I believe that this meeting will have good results, and that it will be a major responsibility to contribute to the War of Resistance and national construction.

### Japanese Planes Attack Tongbai and Bomb American Church

(Beiping) The American church in Tongbai, on the border of Henan and Hubei, was completely destroyed by Japanese planes on May 2nd.

Several Chinese were killed, but no foreigners were injured. It is reported that the map of the location of the church was sent to the Japanese army a year ago. (17th Reuters dispatch)

### British Cabinet Reviews Reply to Soviet Union, Prepares to Propose New Counter-Proposal, Advocates Issuing Joint Declaration of Three Countries, Declaring Mutual Assistance to Guarantee European Security

(London) The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the Soviet government's reply to the proposal to organize an anti-aggression group. According to official sources, the government will send a new counter-proposal to the Soviet Union within 48 hours, the content of which will be no more than four points: (1) The United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union issue a joint declaration, declaring their determination to prevent aggression within Europe. (2) The Soviet Union provides guarantees to its neighbors. (3) If the Soviet Union is subjected to aggression as a result of implementing this guarantee, the United Kingdom and France will provide assistance. (4) The United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union agree on various practical military measures so that the existing political agreements can be quickly implemented as soon as there is time. The governments of the United Kingdom and France will continue to exchange opinions in order to determine the content of this new counter-proposal. As for the proposals put forward in the Soviet government's reply, it is reported that they are mainly divided into three points: (1) The United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union should conclude a mutual assistance agreement to maintain European security. (2) The United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union should jointly guarantee the security of Poland and Romania, and should also guarantee the security of the Soviet Union's other neighbors, namely Latvia, Estonia, and Finland. (3) The United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union should agree on various military measures so that the existing political agreements can be quickly implemented once there is an emergency.

From this, it can be seen that the British and Soviet plans differ only in form and are not fundamentally different. The reason why the United Kingdom does not approve of providing guarantees to the Baltic Sea countries (namely Latvia, Estonia, and Finland) is that it is doubtful whether those countries are willing to accept them.

(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Halifax is scheduled to come here before the 20th of this month to discuss the progress of the current British-Soviet negotiations with the French authorities. Foreign Minister Bonnet recently met with British Ambassador Phipps to prepare for the matter. It is heard that the French authorities will propose a compromise plan regarding the proposals made by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, advocating (1) that the Soviet Union should also guarantee all of the Soviet Union's neighboring countries that are guaranteed by the United Kingdom and France, (2) that if the Soviet Union joins the war due to the obligations it fulfills towards the Baltic Sea countries without being guaranteed by the United Kingdom and France, then the United Kingdom and France should provide assistance. Its nature is more explicit than the British proposal, its scope is more limited, and it can also fully satisfy the Soviet Union's proposed principle of reciprocity, which can be used as the basis for negotiations.

### Franco-Soviet Alliance to be Revised, Used as Bridge to Communicate with United Kingdom and Soviet Union

(Paris) France plans to win over the Soviet Union to join the anti-aggression front of the United Kingdom and France. It is said that it intends to revise the Franco-Soviet military alliance so as to use it as a direct bridge between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The French plan is to lay the foundation for reconciliation. According to the proposal, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union can be expected to approach each other without the need to form a tripartite alliance, which is opposed by London. The French side has proposed to the Soviet Union to request the revision of the Franco-Soviet military alliance so that it includes not only mutual assistance in resisting foreign aggression, but also mutual assistance when France is dragged into the war as a result of fulfilling other anti-aggression agreements. Since France and Britain already have extremely close ties, the Franco-Soviet alliance is actually the basis for indirect connection between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union.

### Majority of Cabinet Members Oppose Alliance, Fear Japan will Use as Pretext

(London) The Cabinet held a cabinet meeting at 10:30 this morning to thoroughly review the Soviet government's reply to the proposal to organize an anti-aggression group and the new counter-proposal that the British government should put forward. This new counter-proposal is scheduled to be telegraphed to Sir Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, tomorrow. It is rumored that the majority of members of the British Cabinet are still unwilling to conclude a treaty of alliance with the Soviet Union, lest Japan and Spain use it as a pretext to conclude a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy, but all advocate that once the Soviet Union is subjected to aggression as a result of guaranteeing its neighbors, Britain should provide assistance in accordance with the principle of reciprocity.

### Potemkin Not Going to Geneva, London Feels Disappointed

(London) The Soviet government has decided to send its ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, to attend the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council (22nd of this month) to replace Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin. Although the British government cannot help but feel disappointed by this move by the Soviet Union, it has decided to intensify its efforts to establish an agreement with it as soon as possible. (16th Havas dispatch)

(London) The reason why the Soviet Union did not send Potemkin to Geneva to confer with British Foreign Secretary Halifax is generally believed to be an expression of Soviet dissatisfaction with Britain's attitude towards the British-Soviet mutual assistance agreement. The British government believes that if the British attitude can improve and give Moscow a good impression, Potemkin may still attend the League of Nations meeting. (17th Associated Press dispatch)

### Albanian King Submits Appeal to League of Nations, Italian Violence Enters Territory, Asks All Countries Not to Recognize

(London) Albanian King Zog I sent a letter to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol yesterday, formally protesting against Italy's violent annexation of the country and requesting that all member states refuse to recognize it. The original text is very long. Please publish the contents here. It roughly states that "the independent sovereignty enjoyed by our country was successively recognized by the London Conference in 1912 and the meeting of ambassadors of major powers in Paris in 1912. Our country is also one of the member states of the League of Nations. In the past eighteen years, we have always maintained friendly relations with all countries. The defensive alliance treaty signed between our country and Italy has also been filed by the League of Nations. Unexpectedly, without provocation, that country suddenly called out troops to invade our country's territory at the beginning of April this year. What they did not only violated the alliance treaty, but also destroyed the League of Nations covenant and the Paris Pact. Our country has a small land and a population of only one million. It is impossible to fight a protracted war with Italy, which has a population of 44 million and possesses sharp weapons. Now, our country's independence has been destroyed by force. We find it difficult to remain silent about Italy's violent actions in violation of the treaty, and we hereby submit a strict protest and ask you to inform the governments of all member states of this fact, asking them not to recognize Italy's actions by force and to take various appropriate measures so that the Albanian nation can restore its original rights.

(London) Poles in Poland have recently claimed that Germany is currently pursuing a strategy regarding the issue of the Free City of Danzig, forcing Poland to choose one of the following two paths. Either listen to Germany annex the city, and then recognize the fait accompli, or, before Germany publicly invades, take direct intervention action against the city, thereby giving Germany a pretext for a counter-offensive. The number of German "tourists" who have successively gone to the city in recent days is no less than 35,000. The city's Nazi Party is scheduled to hold an "informal plebiscite" on the issue of the city's annexation to Germany in a short period of time, and it will certainly obtain an overwhelming majority of affirmative votes. The city's Senate will also issue a declaration based on this, declaring its incorporation into the German territory. If the Polish government sends troops to enter the city at that time to protect its own interests, then Germany will inevitably use the pretext of "Polish aggression" to attack Polish territory. Germany's strategy is probably this. However, if such a situation does occur, no matter how cleverly Germany defends itself, Poland should immediately request the United Kingdom and France to implement the guarantee. At the same time, the League of Nations should also consider the responsibilities it should bear in accordance with the provisions of the covenant. It can be asserted. (16th Havas dispatch)

Warsaw The government authorities, in view of the tense situation in the Free City of Danzig, have already taken various precautionary measures to deal with Germany. Since the Gdynia port at the northern end of the Polish Corridor, the railway line passing through the city of Danzig to the province of Pomerania, armored vehicles have been transporting troops every day without a specific destination. The authorities intend to use this kind of mobilization to allow their own troops to frequently pass through the city of Danzig and stay in the city as much as possible. Sometimes, because of the "mechanical damage" of the iron middle car, they have to stop for repairs. All of this, in addition to preventing emergencies, also intends to satirize the residents of Danzig. If Germany sends troops to occupy the city, there are indeed various military difficulties. The connection between the city and the German province of East Prussia can only be made via a railway line, and it must pass through Polish territory. There is also the Vistula River running across it. There is also a bridge on the river that can be used for traffic, and it also belongs to the Polish Railway Bureau. (16th Havas dispatch)

### German and Italian Western Border Defenses Claim to be Impenetrable, Hitler and Mussolini Are Quite Satisfied with Inspection, Italy Builds New Airfield on French Border

(London) Hitler and Mussolini are now inspecting their defensive fortifications along the French border. According to a dispatch from Rome, Mussolini left Turin yesterday for the Alps border in Luvol, and inspected the Suluk River basin. Others are controlled by the寨尼斯峯 and沙德顿峯. Italy has set up the highest artillery positions in Europe on the peaks. Mussolini then visited the cavalry school in Pinerolo. At the same time, Hitler inspected the Saar region yesterday. It is heard that the Siegfried Line, which is opposite the French Maginot Line, has an average depth of 30 miles and contains 12,000 defensive points, ranging in form from underground machine gun bunkers to huge underground artillery fortresses. Currently, 435,000 people are engaged in construction. (17th Reuters dispatch)

Saar Hitler inspected the Western border defense works, and arrived in the Saar region yesterday. It is said that the impression of the head of state's inspection trip was very satisfactory. All the defensive works are mostly covered by camouflage, and non-military experts cannot identify their authenticity. (17th Haitong dispatch)

(Berlin) The newspapers have recently commented on the matter of the Führer Hitler inspecting the Western border defenses, saying that "the Siegfried Line is impenetrable, with a total of 12,000 fortresses, defended by 85,000 soldiers, and served by 250,000 workers and 100,000 members of the labor service corps.

Turin Authoritative sources revealed last night that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will park his huge air force, a large number of fighter jets, at the Mario Beertierlomi airfield. According to reports, the airfield was completed on Sunday and is only 25 miles away from the French border. It is said that the purpose of concentrating a large number of fighter jets here is to protect Turin's industrial area. (17th Associated Press dispatch)

### Axis Powers' Plans Encounter Obstacles Everywhere; Pact Set to Be Signed on Monday, Intended as Empty Threats

(Berlin) Although Berlin newspapers regard Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's recent speech in Turin and German Führer Hitler's inspection of western defenses as a strong response from the totalitarian states to the democratic front, foreign observers in Berlin say that the momentum of the Rome-Berlin Axis's dynamic policy has recently slowed. Both Germany and Italy apparently feel frustrated. The German government recently attempted to enlist Spain into the German-Italian military and economic bloc, but according to private sources, this effort has failed. When Aviation Minister General Göring recently returned from Italy on the "Hualaga Lang" postal ship, he originally planned to detour through Spain and invited General Franco to meet at a location within Spain for talks. General Franco immediately replied that under the current circumstances, he could not only not properly host him but also could not guarantee his safety. General Göring then requested that Franco designate any port on the Spanish coast so that the "Hualaga Lang" could sail to that port for a meeting on board, but General Franco still did not accept. General Göring had to abandon his trip to Spain and return directly to Germany. Furthermore, Walter, a consultant from the German Ministry of Economic Affairs, was originally scheduled to go to Burgos to negotiate a commercial agreement with the Spanish authorities, but this has now been indefinitely postponed, indicating that Spanish public opinion towards Germany is largely unfavorable. (Havas, 17th)

(Berlin) Semi-official sources here claim that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to arrive here on the 21st of this month to sign a political and military treaty with the German authorities. Führer Hitler is scheduled to host a banquet that evening and deliver an important speech to clarify the significance of the treaty. (Havas, 16th)

(Paris) The political and military treaty between Germany and Italy is scheduled to be signed in Berlin on the 22nd of this month. German Führer Hitler is currently inspecting fortifications in the west, while Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is inspecting the French border area. French officials commented that all of these actions are intended to intimidate foreign public opinion. In reality, even after the establishment of the political and military treaty between Germany and Italy, neither country is likely to take any serious actions. If Germany's ambitions remain unchecked and it threatens world peace, Italy may still mediate. Prime Minister Mussolini's recent speech in Turin already hinted at this possibility. Furthermore, the Lateran Treaty established between Italy and the Vatican (established in 1929) stipulated that the Vatican cannot initiate any political actions without the Italian government's consent. Therefore, it can be asserted that the Vatican's recent proposal (to convene an international conference to resolve the German-Polish dispute) had the Italian government's consent. Although this proposal has failed, if the European situation faces another crisis, the Vatican may launch a new initiative. As for Anglo-Italian relations, they remain friendly at present. Italy's concentration of its fleet in the Mediterranean is likely intended to showcase its military strength rather than threaten Britain. (Havas, 16th)

### Three Nordic Countries Respond to Germany, Rejecting Non-Aggression Pact; Decide to Maintain Traditional Neutral Policy; Denmark's Special Situation Means It Does Not Oppose

(Berlin) After the German government proposed non-aggression pacts to the four Nordic countries of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, the Finnish ambassador to Germany submitted a reply to the Foreign Ministry yesterday. The ambassadors of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway jointly delivered their answers to the Foreign Ministry at noon today. It is reported that because Denmark borders Germany, it consulted with the other three countries and did not reject Germany's proposal. However, it also stated that under the current circumstances, the signing of a non-aggression pact between the two countries is not timely and requested the German government to consider it. The replies from Finland, Sweden, and Norway stated that because they wish to maintain neutrality, it is not necessary to establish a non-aggression pact with Germany. Furthermore, observers here also stated that the talk of Germany establishing non-aggression pacts with Latvia and Estonia is now silent. (Havas, 17th)

### Soviet Union Strengthens Combat Readiness; Naval Conscription Period Extended; Two Classes of New Recruits to Be Enlisted This Autumn; Satisfactory Results of Baltic Fleet Exercises

(Moscow) In order to strengthen the combat readiness of the Workers' and Peasants' Navy and improve the technical training of naval specialists, the Soviet government has recently revised the articles of the Universal Military Service Law regarding the service period of naval personnel as follows:

The regular service period for sailors on warships and other vessels of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Navy is set at five years, and for coastal defense personnel, it is set at four years. After the expiration of regular service, personnel who voluntarily continue to serve in the navy must serve for at least three years. The exception clause in the original law regarding the shortening of the service period for personnel who have received higher and secondary education and served in the Workers' and Peasants' Navy has now been abolished.

### British King and Queen Arrive in Canada; Fortress Fires 21-Gun Salute as the People Cheer Wildly; Canadian Prime Minister Leads Entire Cabinet to Pier to Welcome

Quebec The Royal Ship "Australia" sailed into the Wolf's Cove dock at 9:52 this morning. All the ships in the port sounded their horns to welcome it as the ship approached. As the ship sailed slowly in the middle of the river escorted by four warships from Worings Island, the sound of car horns on the shore was deafening. The weather was clear and the water was calm. When the Royal Ship "Australia" passed the monument, Quebec's churches rang their bells to express their welcome. A guard of honor composed of the Canadian Guard in red uniform lined up on the dock, holding flags high and playing military music. A royal altar adorned with flowers was built in the open space of the dock. Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, along with his entire cabinet and their families, also lined up on the dock.

If these commodities are effectively boycotted, Japan will soon be forced to yield.

Health Minister Yan Fuqing Discusses the Greatest Difficulties in Relief Work Lack of Medical Supplies New Pharmaceutical Factory to Be Established in Chengdu to Manufacture for Needs

(Chongqing) Chinese Health Minister Dr. Yan Fuqing told the Associated Press that the biggest difficulty in China's current medical relief work is the lack of medical supplies, the biggest reasons for which are transportation inconveniences and unfavorable financial conditions for China. It is said that the freight for each truck of medical supplies from Hong Kong to the mainland costs 800 yuan and takes five weeks. Although we can import several tons of medical supplies every month, it is far from meeting the actual demand. Dr. Yan continued that the number of medical relief personnel in Chongqing is still sufficient, but other places still feel that there are not enough trained medical personnel. This shortage can be somewhat compensated for by the graduates of various medical universities this spring. In addition, there are also some foreign medical personnel who voluntarily joined the effort. Dr. Yan also said that the Chinese side will soon establish a new pharmaceutical factory in Chengdu to meet China's needs for medicines, but the prospects for its success are only optimistic, because of insufficient funds, lack of talent, and problems with replenishing materials. Therefore, the difficulties in pharmaceutical manufacturing can be imagined. Although some medicines can be manufactured, mass production of various medicines that meet standards requires several years of experimentation. The problem we face is not providing manufacturing with imported raw materials but manufacturing on our own with domestic medicinal materials and raw materials. Otherwise, even if we can manufacture, it will still be of no help. According to the doctor, the guidance work of this new pharmaceutical factory will be undertaken by Dr. Musell, a Canadian missionary who has been in China for more than 30 years. The funding will be borne by the Chinese government and the British, American, and Canadian instructors of West China Union University. Musell, the director of the new pharmaceutical factory, told the Associated Press that 20,000 yuan has been spent on equipment and instruments, while the cost of the factory building is 66,000 yuan, and the annual operating expenses are 12,000 yuan. According to Dr. Musell, this factory is mostly experimental in nature, because to establish a large-scale pharmaceutical factory, the annual expenses would be at least 5 million yuan, and it would take five years before there would be any profit. As for the new pharmaceutical factory currently established, although it can manufacture some crude medicines, other pharmaceutical methods that require high technology still require many years of experimentation. Perhaps even at that time, it will still rely on imported raw materials for compounding. According to the doctor, there have been several cases of cholera in Chongqing, so the government authorities have ordered all hospitals to provide free vaccinations. At the same time, in order to improve the efficiency of air raid casualty relief in the future, the number of casualty beds in the city has been increased to 1,500, and the church hospitals have also increased the number of casualty beds by 300 in the past week. There are also 30 male and female casualty teams that can be dispatched to serve at any time. (Associated Press, 15th)

### Japan Decides to Strengthen Control over Chinese Coal Industry

(Tokyo) According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese government has decided to establish a formal and fully authorized agency in the entire Yen Bloc area (Japan, "Manchukuo," North China, Central China) to control the production, distribution, and consumption of coal. The agency will be named "Japan-Manchukuo-China Coal Affairs Committee," which will include representatives of Japanese officials, the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Navy Ministry, the Cabinet Planning Agency, the China Affairs Bureau, the Manchukuo Affairs Bureau, and approximately leading coal mining experts from China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." The agency will replace the Coal Production Control Office and the Coal Distribution Control Office. In addition, a Japan-Manchukuo-China Coal Affairs Joint Association will be established as an advisory group. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has decided to strengthen the control of coal distribution to remedy the increasingly insufficient supply of coal. Past control was limited to coal used for ironmaking and gas production, and coal made into briquettes for iron casting and similar industries. In the future, it will extend to coal used by various factories and the ceramic industry. The Yen Bloc area needs coal in increasing quantities due to the implementation of Japan's three-year production increase plan. At the same time, due to a lack of equipment and labor, the supply of coal is insufficient. The Japanese government hopes that after expanding the distribution control, it can ensure an adequate supply of coal for the military industry. (Reuters, 16th)

### Chinese Army Sieges Xinhui County Seat, Japanese Army Liaison Between Jiangmen and Xinhui First Cut Off, Japanese Army Urgently Transfers Troops from Shunde to Reinforce

Hong Kong Dispatch: The Chinese army's counter-offensive against Xinhui and Jiangmen had long been mobilizing troops and making meticulous arrangements. Since the beginning of this month, the Guangdong Army's Zhang Division and the Guangxi Army's Chen Division have been advancing along the Xinhui-Heishan and Xinkai highways. On the 1st and 2nd, they had already approached Foziao, Daxiao Mei, and Shatiqiao. The Japanese side then increased its troops by more than a thousand and drove to Waiyuan Line to provide support and maintain liaison between Jiangmen and Heshui strongholds and Shunde Japanese army. On the evening of the 5th, important Japanese military officers from Jiangmen and Heshui held a military meeting at the Japanese Club on Changan Road in Jiangmen to discuss strategies for dealing with the Chinese army's counter-offensive and prepare for the construction of defensive fortifications in anticipation of street fighting in a desperate attempt to resist. The meeting was presided over by Kana, commander of the Kana Regiment of the Wuchuan Division. Major General Zhi Song, commander of the 8th Regiment, Colonel Aoki, Captain Fujita, and managers of various Japanese commercial firms attended the meeting. The content of the meeting was to actively deploy military forces to prevent the Chinese army's counter-offensive. By the 6th, the Chinese army had launched a large-scale attack on Xinhui County. The brave warriors of the Guangxi Army showed exceptional courage, first recovering areas near Daze and then advancing toward the Xindi Bridge in Huicheng, immediately launching a large-scale attack on Huicheng. That night, they once charged into Huicheng, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army, seeing the fierce offensive of the Chinese army and the considerable number of casualties among regular Japanese troops, withdrew all railway soldiers and mechanized cavalry units to the Beijie area of Jiangmen and Heshui for defense. The Japanese combat troops in Huicheng only drove the forced local civilians to form an advancing team as a vanguard. These people had no intention of fighting, and the Gangzhou Highway from Huicheng to Jiangmen was cut off by the Chinese army, preventing the Japanese army in Xinhui from receiving supplies from Jiangmen. The guerrillas near Gangzhou Highway also extensively destroyed the roadbed at Dahui, Qibang, and Jiangzui, making it impassable. Therefore, the Japanese forces in Jiangmen and Heshui were in a very difficult situation. As a result, there has been no Japanese vehicle transportation on this road for the past two days. If the Japanese army transferred troops from Jiangmen to Huicheng, Jiangmen might be attacked by the Chinese army at any time. If the Japanese army moved troops from Huicheng to Jiangmen, Huicheng would be recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese army was in a dilemma, so it remained stationed and awaited reinforcements, and Xinhui County Seat was also surrounded. In addition to completing a land-based airport in Baishi, Beijie, and dispatching teams to guard it, the Japanese army also built light artillery forts in Huicheng Zhishan and Jiangmen nearby mountains, installing guns and artillery in preparation for countering the Chinese army's counter-offensive. If the Japanese army retreats steadily, it can also be dismantled and transported away immediately.

With Huicheng surrounded by the Chinese army, the Japanese army trapped inside the city faced a major problem with food, ammunition, and other supplies. The Japanese army in Beijie and Jiangmen had repeatedly resolved to try to provide assistance, but they did not dare to advance due to insufficient troops. On the morning of the 9th, the Japanese army in Huicheng, fearing that they would be wiped out by the Chinese army if besieged for a long time, broke out of the siege and engaged in fierce warfare with the Chinese army. However, the Chinese army adopted a strategy of waiting for the enemy at leisure, and would not fire on the Japanese army breaking out of the siege until they were within a considerable range. The situation of the two armies was unclear until the afternoon of that day, and the outcome of the battle was not yet known, but the Japanese army had transferred troops from Shunde to reinforce Jiangmen and Heshui. For example, more than 2,000 people who had recently arrived in Guizhou had been transferred to Jiangmen. The traitor Li Daoxuan often traveled between Jiangmen and Daliang City to intensify the oppression of the people in order to contain the mobilization of the people's armed forces in Shunde, so that they could not support the Chinese army's counter-offensive against Jiangmen and Heshui.

At present, the number of Japanese warships in the Beijie area of Xinhui has slightly decreased. A large ship docked in Beijie a few days ago was loaded with package-like items by the Japanese army and sailed away in the afternoon. After leaving Beijie, it sailed back to Tokyo, and the package-like items transported were the ashes of Japanese soldiers. The number of Japanese motorboats has also decreased from more than 110 to 50 or 60. The No. 13 Japanese shallow water warship is still docked on the Beijie River. There are also two shallow water warships with unknown numbers patrolling in the Beijie area. In the rivers of Xinhui County, bandits are rampant. In the Qibao area, guerrillas are stationed on land and are responsible for maintaining law and order. Therefore, land law and order is still stable, but in various waterways, bandits often impersonate guerrillas, openly carrying weapons to intercept and rob. The personnel responsible for Jiangfang security are far away in neighboring counties and are afraid of Japanese motorboats, so they do not dare to patrol, allowing the bandits to expand and endanger the refugees. Therefore, the people in the county, after escaping the slaughter of the Japanese army, are intercepted and robbed by bandits, facing a dilemma. The situation is very tragic.

### Japanese Army in Xuzhou Forcibly Arrests Civilians

Including Three Presbyterian Pastors Also Arrested, and Also Searches Villages in the Suburbs of Xuzhou and Burns Houses

The Zi Lin Bao reports that, according to news received regarding the situation in Xuzhou, northern Jiangsu, the Japanese authorities are currently taking extreme measures in an attempt to curb the increasingly active guerrillas in the area. In the past year, foreigners and the Japanese army in the area have been living in relative peace. Recently, they have been subjected to detailed investigations by local authorities. The police have indiscriminately arrested Chinese people they deem suspicious and have invaded foreign properties. At 2:00 AM on May 7th, local police, assisted by Japanese soldiers, continuously arrested twelve well-known Chinese people in the city and threw them into prison. Among them, three were pastors of the Presbyterian Church. One of the Chinese people was arrested at his residence without even having time to put on his clothes and was immediately tied with ropes. The commander of the Japanese army in the area then met with foreigners but did not state the reasons for the arrests. According to what can be confirmed, the authorities have not accused the arrested people of any crimes but intend to detain them for observation, hoping that they will reveal information about the activities of various guerrilla units. Chinese residents near the prison said that they heard screams from the houses of the detainees. Some people tried to enter to meet with the detainees but were not allowed. It is said that the suspects are now being tortured to force them to reveal information. The deputy commander of the Japanese army in Xuzhou, after being asked to investigate the torture, replied that he would investigate the matter, but there has been no result so far. Instead, another well-known Chinese person was arrested, and it is said that he was also subjected to the same torture. Military authorities have also searched for guerrilla units in several villages in the suburbs of Xuzhou and set fire to houses, causing villagers to be displaced. During a worship service in a small church, it was suddenly searched. All those in the church who did not have small badges worn by Chinese Christian followers in the area were taken out of the church, lined up, and shot dead. A foreigner arrived at the scene fifteen minutes after the tragedy occurred and reported the incident to the authorities, but the response was only that the guerrillas must be eliminated. Although the wheat harvest in the villages outside Xuzhou is expected to be good this year, there is often the risk of sudden raids by Japanese military police and guerrillas, making it impossible for them to harvest. Therefore, the situation of farmers in most villages is extremely difficult.

### After the Tragic Bombing of ChaoShan, People's Hearts are Agitated, ChaoAn Repeatedly Uncovers Traitor Organizations

Shantou Dispatch: Since May 4th, various counties in Chaoshan have been tragically bombed by Japanese aircraft for three consecutive days. The prosperous Shantou urban area has suddenly turned into a field of rubble. People seeking refuge have been leaving the city all night. Larger stores and companies are rushing to close down, hiring ships to transport their inventory to the upper reaches of the Han River, establishing branches in various market towns on the riverbank to sell old goods. At present, the Liuhuang, Tankou, Gaobei, Taohua, Sanhe, Dabu, Shishang, Fenglang, Suixing, Pengla, Songkou, Bingcun, Yanyang, Songshuping, Xiyang, Baigong, Changshayu, Dami, Guantang, Yekeng, Meixian, Xingning, various cities and towns, all empty stores, thatched huts, and tea stalls have been rented by relocated shops, converted into small businesses to maintain their livelihoods during the refuge period. Although the number of overseas Japanese warships has been reduced by four recently, people's hearts are still tense. According to a certain intelligence report, several transport ships from Taiwan, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, have set sail for Guangdong. Several units of Japanese troops are also densely stationed in Siming, Xiamen, plotting to spy on Tongshan County on the border of Fujian and Guangdong, hoping to break through the territory of Zhao'an and Yunxiao counties. Therefore, the authorities are stepping up preparations for war. Women and children who have left Shantou are not allowed to enter the urban area again, and ships from Chaoyang, Jieyang, and Chenghai will depart from 6:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next morning, carrying passengers to the interior. From the 8th to the 12th, every night, three to five thousand people left Shantou. Residents of Chao'an, Jieyang, Chenghai, and Raoping are also dispersing in the same way. Police Commander Hua Zhenzhong has been inspecting the work of destroying highways and evacuating the population in various counties in recent days, and progress has been made in various places. However, Chaoyang County is closest to the sea, and the people are the most stubborn, and the work of mobilizing and organizing the masses has not achieved any results. Repeatedly persuading them to evacuate, no one is willing to move. As for those listed in the draft register, they have either fled early or hired someone to replace them. After Hua Zhenzhong inspected the county, he only encouraged the new County Magistrate Xie Fenchu to double his efforts and strive to reach the standards required for wartime preparedness. In various places in Chao'an, many traitor organizations have been uncovered, and dozens of male and female traitors have been arrested. It is said that the Chinese military authorities have a general understanding of the situation on the Japanese side, and that their intrusion into Fujian and Guangdong is indeed a complete plan and has not been relaxed in the slightest.

### Large Batch of Japanese Army Gunpowder Intercepted by Chinese Army in Yangzhou, Totaling Twenty-One Large Boxes, Also Intercepted Puppet Army Uniforms, Etc.

Yangzhou Dispatch: Since Zhang Jichuan, the new County Magistrate of Jiangdu County, took office, he has organized several ×× battalions to engage in attacking the Japanese puppets. A few days ago, × groups of this battalion learned that a large batch of Japanese military supplies would pass through Shijiaqiao, Liuzhou, etc., from Zhenjiang to Lianyungang. Therefore, they secretly sent members carrying short guns to lie in ambush there. At the appointed time, a Japanese truck, loaded with gunpowder and escorted by five Japanese and puppet soldiers, passed by. The members bravely jumped out and attacked with guns, wounding two puppet soldiers. The rest fled in panic. All twenty-one large boxes of gunpowder were seized (its shape is similar to Xuantan thread incense, but also like beef tendons, and it is said to be used for arson and as a signal, with each box valued at several hundred yuan) and sent to the county government, which was then presented to the Jiangsu Provincial Government. In addition, the ×th battalion of this battalion, on the 8th of this month, together with the Huxi Broadsword Team, advanced from Xujia Lane to Huaisi Bridge (less than ten miles from Yangzhou City), carrying only two rifles, one box gun, and ten hand grenades. They broke through the puppet police station in the town, captured the puppet patrol officer Xu Quan and fourteen puppet policemen, and confiscated hundreds of pieces of puppet army uniforms, puppet official documents, and puppet Great People's Congress propaganda items, which were all presented to the county government. County Magistrate Zhang, recognizing the battalion's repeated meritorious service, not only rewarded them with 140 yuan in advance, but also telegraphed the province to request a reward.

### New Domestic Policy Measures During the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, Special Emphasis Placed on Hygiene, Opium Suppression, Police Administration, and Civil Affairs

Chongqing Dispatch: For more than a year, although the government has been actively resisting the war, it has also been actively developing various domestic policy measures in the rear, with the aim of coordinating with the military. The work that has been particularly emphasized includes four aspects. Regarding hygiene, a special agency is responsible for handling everything, and progress has been the fastest. Provincial hygiene offices and hygiene experiment offices have been established one after another. Recently, in view of the relative backwardness of the border provinces, a Northwest Hygiene Commissioner's Office has been established in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, and a recurring expenditure of 800,000 yuan has been allocated for eight months of this year to facilitate its implementation. A hygiene institute has also been established in Xikang. Along the rear highways, hygiene stations have been set up, and medical teams have been deployed throughout the roads to alleviate the shortage of medical and epidemic prevention facilities in the interior. Regarding opium suppression, the ban on planting has long been strictly enforced, and it was stipulated that it would be completely banned by the end of last year. Recently, fearing that there would still be secret planting in various places, special teams have been formed to inspect and investigate planting bans in various places. Sichuan is organizing inspection teams by the Civil Affairs Department, with guidance from the Ministry of Interior. Other provinces are dispatching personnel from the Opium Suppression Committee of the Ministry of Interior to conduct inspections. The Sichuan inspection team will depart soon. This year, the ban on opium smoking must also be strictly enforced. Smoking and selling establishments will be banned. Except for the elderly over sixty years old, smoking is generally prohibited. Regarding police administration, unified command and unified training are currently being carried out. All provincial and municipal police training schools are subsidized by the Ministry of Interior, with 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per school per year. The directors of education are also generally selected and appointed by the Ministry of Interior. This will ensure that training standards tend to be consistent. Regarding civil affairs, the reform of provincial and county administrative institutions is currently underway to make them sound. The reform plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and is still being reviewed by the Central Political Committee. The principles of the reform are: first, to make the provincial government a supervisory body in terms of administration; second, to strengthen the powers of administrative supervisors, so that they are directly responsible to the central government for the command of local administration and are directly responsible for supervising county governments in the supervisory system of the provincial government; third, to increase the powers of county magistrates and provide them with corresponding safeguards, with counties with a population of more than 500,000 classified as special counties; fourth, to change the district, township, baojia system to adapt to the new institutions. It is expected that this new method will be implemented after June of this year. As for war zone administration, in addition to the provincial governments still leading and supervising the various provinces, the central government has established a special Party and Government Committee, which will handle matters related to war zone administration in conjunction with the Ministry of Interior. In the occupied areas, such as Weihaiwei and Jiujiang, competent personnel are still directly handling the administration of the two districts. The original police in the various war zones have been registered, rescued, trained, and assigned to local guerrilla work.

### Jingjiang County Magistrate Zhu Ji Dies by Suicide after Being Shot, Zhu's Conflict with Taixing Self-Defense Force over Tax Issues

Jingjiang Dispatch: Zhu Ji, currently the Deputy Brigade Commander of the 4th Brigade of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Force and concurrently the County Magistrate of Jingjiang County, courtesy name Qianli, served as the leader of the security detachment after the fall of Jingjiang. After several attacks on the Japanese army, he was promoted to his current position. Since Zhu concurrently served as the county magistrate, he worked hard to reform and develop the county, and handled tax collection meticulously. Merchants were punished if they were slightly careless. However, the business tax revenue in the Xinhang area alone was as high as 30,000 yuan per month. His brigade headquarters was located in a pawnshop in Huangqiao. On the 5th of this month, Zhang Gongren, the former provincial party member of the Nantong District and currently the commander of the Taixing District People's Defense Force, led more than a thousand people to besiege Zhu's brigade headquarters for three days and nights due to tax issues. On the 8th, Zhu led his subordinates to break out of the encirclement, but Zhu was unwilling and immediately collected his subordinates for a desperate battle. Zhu was shot and seriously injured as a result. He was carried away by his guard Guo Liang, but died without medical treatment. However, Zhu's subordinates were still unaware. While charging and killing, they did not see Zhu's whereabouts and were shocked, so they stopped fighting. However, both sides suffered casualties. At this critical moment of national crisis, there is still such a phenomenon, which is sighing.

### Track and Field Meet: China Athletic Association Loses to School Association, Score of 61 to 54, Performance Still Acceptable, Lido to Join Triangular Meet Next Wednesday

The China Athletic Association track and field team and the Chinese School Association team held their first competition yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. at the American Boys School. Thirteen events were originally scheduled, but the javelin throw was canceled by mutual agreement. The Chinese School Association team was composed of elite athletes from schools such as Chi Mei, St. Francis, Northern China Children’s School, and St. John's, making them exceptionally strong. Moreover, their team members had already participated in numerous battles and were skilled. Yesterday, all the athletes of the China Athletic Association also did their best, fighting fiercely with the School Association until the last 880-yard relay. At that time, the School Association was ahead by three points. If the China Athletic Association had won, there would have been a glimmer of hope. Among the scores, the 10.2 seconds in the 100-yard dash was barely satisfactory. Most of the scores did not meet expectations. This may be a typical early-season phenomenon. It is now known that the China Athletic Association, Lido, and the School Association will hold a triangular meet at the American Boys School next Wednesday. It is expected that better results will be produced at that time. The details of each event are as follows:

Field Events

In the 100-yard and 220-yard sprints, Sun Hupei and Dai Shuguo of the China Athletic Association participated. The Edwards brothers of St. Francis were truly outstanding, taking the first and second places in both events. Dai only secured a third place. Dai Shuguo, who holds the national record in the 440-yard dash, did not participate, so Kuai Shitai of the Northern China Children’s School led from beginning to end. However, the results were not particularly impressive. Beckner won the 880-yard race effortlessly. Liu Guangfa also easily won the mile race and still had energy to spare after the race. In the low hurdles, Li Zhenzhong of the China Athletic Association was still in first place at 70 yards, but his endurance failed, and he was overtaken by Rodionov and others. The 880-yard relay was the last event held. At that time, the China Athletic Association had 58 points, and the School Association had 61 points. Winning this event meant victory. The atmosphere around the stadium was tense. Unfortunately, the first runner of the China Athletic Association, Da Mao Cha Hai'er, was almost ten meters behind. The second runner, Da Edward, sprinted away. When Xiao Edward crossed the finish line amidst cheers, Dai Shuguo was left 150 yards behind. The China Athletic Association's defeat was due to this.

Track Events

In the five field events, the China Athletic Association was stronger than the School Association. Except for the 16-pound shot put, they won all the championships. In the high jump, Wu Bixian did not knock down the bar once from the starting jump to clearing five feet seven and a half inches. Because the first and second places had already been decided, he did not continue to jump. Wu's performance was not limited to this. Zhang Jiabian and Hao Chunde swept the top three places for the China Athletic Association in the long jump. The long jump result of 21 feet 7 inches was not weak. The complete results are recorded below:

### National Colleges and Universities Add Wartime Curriculum, A Total of 28 Special Courses Added

(Special Chongqing Dispatch) The Ministry of Education issued a wartime order to national public and private colleges and universities to focus on wartime curriculum, which is divided into four categories: (1) deleting unimportant subjects, (2) adding special teaching materials to existing subjects, (3) adding special teaching subjects, and (4) adding special research subjects. According to reports from public and private colleges and universities, a total of 28 types of special subjects and research subjects have been added. Excerpts are as follows:

(1) Regarding science subjects, there are four types: toxic gas chemistry, refined charcoal oil, national defense chemistry, and pyrotechnics.

(2) Regarding engineering subjects, there are five types: weaponry, fortification, air defense, automobile driving, and road construction engineering.

(3) Regarding medical subjects, there are four types: wartime first aid, military nursing, bandaging techniques, and research on activated iodine.

(4) Regarding agricultural subjects, there are three types: immigrant settlement, food management, and famine relief.

(5) Regarding liberal arts subjects, there are four types: Sun Tzu's Art of War, historical war materials, mobile libraries, and ethnic movements.

(6) Regarding law and commerce subjects, there are five types: wartime economics, wartime finance, wartime government, wartime economic policy, and wartime social work.

(7) Regarding education subjects, there are three types: wartime education, military psychology, and wartime primary and secondary school curriculum.

Each school has also compiled teaching material outlines and implementation steps for the newly added subjects, and has designated fixed funding for the necessary equipment. As a result, the wartime curriculum of each school has become more ideal and concrete. Other items and implementation steps regarding spiritual training and physical exercise have also been established in detail and implemented accordingly.

In addition, Central University, Jiaotong University, Southwest Associated University, and Northwest Institute of Technology have successively established aviation departments. Each school has also formulated its own methods for extracurricular activities. For example, Northeast University and other schools stipulate that the original curriculum should be taught ahead of schedule, and in the afternoon, students should be organized into various training classes, such as political training, engineering training, military training, military chemistry, and first aid training classes, in order to prepare students to serve in the military at any time.

### Youth Employment Issues: Speech by Mr. Shen Guanglie at the Shanghai Middle School Student Enrollment and Employment Guidance Class

Mr. Shen Guanglie of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute recently gave a speech at the Shanghai Middle School Student Enrollment and Employment Guidance Class, entitled "Youth Employment Issues." The original text is recorded below: Fellow students, I am very happy to have the opportunity to talk to you about youth employment issues today. I work at the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute, and most of the people I come into contact with on a daily basis are young people in the workforce. Almost all day long, I revolve around the issue of seeking employment. Although it is extremely troublesome, I am quite interested and have many thoughts. Now, I will talk about the actual situation I have seen, heard, and thought about, which may be useful for your reference.

Employment is Necessary After School

The employment problem is more important among youth problems, because people cannot live independently of life. To maintain life, one must rely on a career. Although learning is very important, the final destination must also be employment. The more knowledgeable one is, the greater his contribution. The less knowledgeable one is, the smaller his contribution. The nature of the occupation is the same. Finding a partner is also an inevitable process for young people, but if there is no economic foundation, the result will not be satisfactory. How to obtain economy must depend on occupation. Therefore, the occupation problem can also be said to be a life problem.

Occupation is Very Complex

The analysis of occupations can be divided into several types. One is based on labor, "Those who labor with their minds govern others; those who labor with their strength are governed by others," which is of course no longer in line with the times. Another is based on stillness and movement. Some occupations are relatively quiet, such as research work. Some occupations involve more activities and contact, such as political work, but they cannot be clearly divided. There are also divisions based on agriculture, industry, and commerce. There is also the common saying of 360 occupations. In short, it is very complex. According to the survey and research of the China Vocational Education Society, there are no less than seven or eight hundred items. With the progress of science today, there are more emerging industries, and the classification is more detailed. Which occupation is good to engage in depends on one's personality and the suitability of the environment before a decision can be made.

Three Classes of Occupational Life

In today's field of occupational life, it can be roughly divided into three classes. The first class is those who cook before eating, who can not only support themselves but also solve the life problems of others, such as running industries, opening companies and factories, etc., which require a large number of employees. The second class is those who beg for food, who maintain life by exchanging their labor for compensation, mostly salaried workers. The third class is those who grab food, who rely on the inheritance of their ancestors and sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor, doing nothing all day long, and are the parasites of society. Newly graduated students may lack the experience to be in the first class, and they certainly do not want to be in the third class in terms of interests. Generally speaking, the second class is the most common. (To be continued)

### Marital Discord Often Stems from Weakening Sexual Function

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

One of the most joyful things in life is the love between men and women, but the most miserable thing in the world is also an unhappy marriage. In society, there are many couples who often complain and lament because they are dissatisfied with each other. Those with stubborn personalities do not hesitate to sacrifice their lives. Therefore, a union without love is not as happy as living alone. However, since life is for the purpose of reproduction, and we are endowed with two major desires—appetite and sexual desire—we cannot ultimately resist nature. Therefore, the only remedy is to enrich our knowledge of courtship after marriage.

To study methods of courtship, the first question that must be understood is the source of love between men and women. This question actually involves medicine. The world's famous physicians unanimously believe that the love between men and women is related to energy. Sex expert Dr. Ellis of England frankly stated, "Love between couples comes from carnal desire." This is a wise saying. If a man is sexually weak and powerless, and the two parties cannot coordinate in their sexual lives, then love will rapidly decline, and even the two parties will become like fire and water, inevitably leading to marital discord.

Smart men: On your wedding night, do you consider that your sexual power will tend to decline in the future? If you want to consider this point, then you must first avoid indulgence, because after indulgence, neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, and impotence can erupt, increasing the other party's troubles and blocking the door to your courtship.

The causes of premature ejaculation, impotence, and neurasthenia are as mentioned above. However, the method of treatment must start with increasing spirit and tonifying the kidneys. Therefore, the symptomatic treatment of choice is "Comprecon," a testicular essence preparation for men invented by Dr. Meulen of Germany. After taking it, sexual function is active and healthy, and the complexion is ruddy. Taking it continuously for a season can make the body flourish and rejuvenate. Women with underdeveloped characteristics, such as atrophied breasts, incomplete hip development, infertility after marriage, anemia, and premature aging, should take "Comprecon" for women, because it is a truly pure ovarian endocrine preparation, a sacred medicine for gynecology.

Modern Medicine

### Can One Abstain from Sex When Suffering from Gonorrhea?

— Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Gonorrhea is highly contagious. Women can infect men, and men can also infect women. Therefore, if one suffers from gonorrhea and does not get treated, or deliberately gives up, the consequences will be unimaginable. This is especially true for those who are already married.

Statistics from various medical experts show that gonorrhea patients account for the largest number of venereal disease patients. Originally, gonorrhea is extremely difficult to cure. If one does not take the latest German gonorrhea-specific drug "Clinone" properly, but abuses miscellaneous drugs, the result will inevitably be that the joints are corroded by gonorrhea toxins, becoming paralyzed and disabled. One must know that gonococci are not limited to local areas and the urethral mucosa for activity and survival, but are scattered and reside in deep tissues and blood in the body, so treatment must be thorough. When men suffer from gonorrhea, the testicles are first damaged. When women suffer from gonorrhea, the ovaries are immediately destroyed. As a result, both the vas deferens and fallopian tubes of men and women become blocked due to inflammation, making it impossible to conceive permanently. Moreover, the wife's vagina is infected with the husband's gonorrhea toxins, causing inflammation and becoming leucorrhea. Therefore, a husband causes infinite pain to his wife due to one sexual intercourse. But to avoid such pain, one must abstain from sex. In fact, it is impossible to abstain from sex for a long time, so the only way is to quickly take "Clinone" to eliminate the bacteria. Externally, use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" to eradicate gonococci between the urethra. For women with gonorrhea leucorrhea, use "Carl Schelde Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, inserting one tablet into the vagina every night before going to bed. Wash it off the next morning. In this way, married couples can be treated at the same time, making it easier to avoid the harm of repeated transmission. In this way, both the pain of abstinence can be avoided, and there is no matter of mutual infection. It is really one fell swoop and two good preparations.

### Pulmonary Reversal

— Sheng Zaiqiang Medical Ornament

If patients with lung disease are found to have reversal symptoms, then the disease is quite dangerous, no doubt has eight third-stage lung disease, those who have hemoptysis are more seriously ill, so patients must not ignore, but according to my experience, as long as patients can rest quietly, take in nutritious substances, and with the efficacy of drugs,

Recently, a patient named Zeng Tianyuan, 24 years old, from Wuxi, has been suffering from lung disease for more than two years. Although he has taken various Chinese and Western essences, it has been completely ineffective. Last autumn, he was introduced by a friend to my clinic for treatment. After X-ray examination, it was found that there were one large and one small cavity in the lungs, and the reversal was very serious, and there was a lot of night sweats, which was very dangerous. So he was ordered to take "Sleeve Lung Nal" and ordered to take care of himself. Three months later, the disease had gone away by more than half, and he recovered after taking it for another three months.

### Small Genitals and Underdevelopment

— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

During the period of puberty, most young people know how to masturbate, but after constantly masturbating, they inevitably develop nocturnal emission. Masturbation can damage the ejaculation center, making it hypersensitive. Sometimes, sperm can leak out unconsciously. If this continues for a long time, excessive consumption of sperm will not be able to meet the needs of development, resulting in underdevelopment and small and weak genitals, creating the most painful problem for young people. From this point of view, it can be seen that nocturnal emission is harmful. However, in this era of scientific enlightenment and medical development, as long as one can regret the past and strive for treatment, there is nothing that will not work.

There is a patient named Shen Yuanruo, from Wuxing, Zhejiang, 20 years old (claimed) - I have been masturbating since I was 15 years old, every night, because my body is still strong, so there is no nocturnal emission. Since then, I have become more indulgent and read obscene books. When I was 17 years old, I suddenly felt overwhelmed. To this day, I often have headaches, my memory is very weak, and I often think wildly at night, often suffering from insomnia. I began to realize the harm of masturbation, and there were nocturnal emissions. The number of times gradually increased, even to the point where my sperm leaked out at the slightest touch, and my genitals were as small as a child's. Because I am getting married this autumn, I am here for treatment (treatment process) - I immediately gave a large amount of "Comprecon" and "Ners Enuresis Pills" and electrotherapy for 15 minutes every day. After three months of treatment, development was restored, all symptoms disappeared, and weight increased greatly.

Gonorrhea Forum

### Noteworthy Developments in Gonorrhea

— Physician Yao Juyan

Clinic: 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

If one is infected with gonorrhea and does not pay attention to its future development, one will inevitably suffer terrible consequences one day. However, in general, most people who have had gonorrhea for many years without terrible symptoms delay themselves. They think that their gonorrhea is no longer painful now, so what is the point of treating it? This is really a wrong feeling. Because patients with gonorrhea feel very uncomfortable with the pain of gonorrhea in the early stages, so they have to seek treatment from doctors, or secretly purchase miscellaneous inferior drugs that have not been introduced by famous doctors. In this way, it gradually becomes chronic, and the general superficial irritating symptoms have gradually disappeared. All that remains is that when urinating for the first time every morning, the urethral opening often has gonorrhea strands blocking it, or there are unclean gonorrhea catkins floating on the surface of the urine. Apart from this, it does not seem to feel any pain, so the daily life, diet, and drinking are as indulgent as before the illness. How do they know that the latent gonococci are opening their invasion of the inner urethra, so they often unknowingly erupt various complications, such as arthritis, orchitis, endocarditis, etc., which have both the risk of extinction and disability, and the terrible risk of losing life. This kind of development is really a matter of concern. I have been engaged in the treatment of gonorrhea for more than 20 years, with the purpose of eradicating gonorrhea. The gonorrhea holy medicine "Clinone" is the most reasonable and effective drug for the treatment of acute and chronic gonorrhea, because its bactericidal power is extremely great, and it is also extremely thorough. Furthermore, with the addition of German static electricity therapy and anti-gonorrhea serum, the ever-changing gonorrhea can be completely and fundamentally resolved. And it can guarantee the restoration of reproductive function. Consultation hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., starting today, 20 numbers will be sent for consultation every day, and each number will only cost 50 cents.

### If Japan Takes Action in Shanghai, the U.S. Will Have a Strong Reaction; May Pass Anti-Japanese Amendment to the Neutrality Act; Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce Expresses Opinion

Washington, 16th (Associated Press) - Macdonald, Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, told the Associated Press today that congressional leaders are very friendly to China. If Japan takes drastic action in the Shanghai International Settlement, an anti-Japanese amendment to the Neutrality Act will certainly be passed in Congress. According to Mr. Macdonald, who arrived here last autumn, he maintained close contact with the State Department and congressional leaders during his time here. He is now leaving here and plans to return to China via New York, San Francisco, Vancouver, and other places.

### Congress is Absolutely Friendly to China

He told the Associated Press reporter that Congress is absolutely friendly to China and has decided not to adopt the Neutrality Act or other laws that would hinder China's resistance. The proposals of Pittman and others to ban trade against Japan may not yet have gained sufficient support to pass in Congress, but if Japan takes drastic action in the Shanghai International Settlement, such proposals are likely to pass in Congress. He also said, "The situation in the Far East is no more disruptive than in other parts of the world, especially Europe."

### Philippine Territory Guaranteed Integrity

He believes that American public sentiment has gradually turned against abandoning the Philippines, because if the United States gives up its protection of the Philippines, Japan may seize the island. He continued, "Although this will not affect the legislative process of Philippine independence, public sentiment may reach a point where it will prompt the United States or the international community to guarantee the integrity of its territory. However, I dare say that the United States will never agree to go to war with other countries purely for the defense of the Philippines." He also expressed his belief that Congress will pass some kind of Neutrality Act. It was learned yesterday that Admiral Sir Charles Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, who arrived in Gulangyu on the cruiser HMS Birmingham on Tuesday morning, will be stationed in that port indefinitely to observe developments, so he will not come to Shanghai for the time being.

### Reflections on the Gulangyu Incident

The Shanghai Times published a short commentary yesterday entitled, "Reflections on the Gulangyu Incident," stating that the British Admiral Sir Charles Little traveling to Xiamen on the cruiser HMS Birmingham, and the US cruiser USS Marblehead also ordered to sail to that port from Qingdao, demonstrate that the British and American governments are now taking the Gulangyu International Settlement very seriously. It is generally believed that the simultaneous berthing of two foreign cruisers inside and outside Xiamen Port is unprecedented. The actions of the Japanese in this small concession, their

### Reason for Being There

Opinions vary. Some believe that this is a kind of posture, and if no resistance is offered, they will repeat the tactic elsewhere. The belief that Japan intends to bring the local administration under Japanese control is strengthened when considering the demands made by the Japanese to the Gulangyu Municipal Council. Regardless of the reason, some

### Facts

Should be clarified. The landing of Japanese troops on Gulangyu cannot therefore abolish the provisions of the law or treaties. The Japanese are part of the international basis of Gulangyu. If they believe that their nationals and their property are threatened, they can send troops to land to protect them. British and American troops can also land for the same mission. Since 1927,

### Foreign Troops

Have fulfilled their defense duties in Shanghai, and have landed before to protect their nationals. Now there is a main point that the British and American governments have fully and firmly agreed on, that is, the administration of the Gulangyu Municipal Council must not allow interference. The two governments have taken appropriate diplomatic measures to convey to Japan in no uncertain terms that the two governments are unhappy with Japan's actions in Gulangyu or any other area with the same

### Treaty Basis.

According to interviewer reports, before the landing of Japanese troops on Gulangyu, the island's condition was already tending towards disorder due to military trends. We do not wish to criticize the act of warfare, this is Japan's own business. However, although Gulangyu is the smallest of the foreign areas established by treaty, it is an integral part of the entire system of Chinese statutory concessions. Now, attacking its status is a serious event that the great powers cannot ignore.

### British Ambassador Flies to Hong Kong and Comes to Shanghai to Deal with the Serious Situation in Shanghai

Chongqing, 17th (Associated Press) - According to sources in the British Embassy, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr will fly to Hong Kong on Friday and then transfer to Shanghai. While Ambassador Clark Kerr was here, he repeatedly decided to meet with the highest-ranking Chinese officials, including Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Ambassador Clark Kerr's decision to go to Shanghai is to deal with the serious situation in the Shanghai International Settlement and the possible repercussions of the Japanese occupation of Gulangyu.

### Post-Disaster Relief in Ningbo; Relief Association for Bombing Victims Established; Council Sends Telegram of Condolences to Bereaved Families

Ningbo is a commercial area, not a strategic point of contention. Therefore, since the outbreak of the war, everything in the city has been normal, without any air defense or military equipment. However, from the 28th of last month to the 14th of this month, in half a month, it has been bombed eight times in succession. Each time, there were seven or eight Japanese planes, dropping from ten to dozens of bombs and incendiary bombs. The bombs landed in downtown areas, causing many civilian casualties and destroying thousands of houses, resulting in considerable losses.

### Council Sends Telegram of Condolences to Ningbo

The Zhejiang Provisional Council sent a telegram to Commissioner Xu in Ningbo to express condolences to the bereaved families. The original telegram reads, "Commissioner Xu in Ningbo, greetings. Japanese planes are rampaging, carrying out frequent bombings, causing our compatriots' lives and property to be destroyed, the brutal acts are infuriating. Showing their desperation, they increase our determination to fight the enemy with one heart. Blood debts will be repaid, and the time is not far off. We, the members of this council, extend our condolences to the compatriots in various places who have suffered damage, and to the families of the victims, and hope that you will convey this on our behalf. Respectfully, Xu Qingfu, Speaker of the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Council, Chen Qihuai, Deputy Speaker, and all councilors."

### Relief for Refugees; Continued Evacuation

Since their hometown of Ningbo was bombed, the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai immediately organized an emergency fundraising drive for Ningbo disaster relief. Ningbo people in Shanghai enthusiastically donated, and there is already a considerable amount. Personnel will be sent to Ningbo to express condolences. It is also understood that the Ningbo Bombing Victims Relief Association has also been established, with Zhou Dalie, Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, as the Chairman of the Committee. He specially donated 5,000 yuan from his late wife, Ms. Wang Bao Ying's private savings to the association as relief funds. His public spirit and sense of justice are worthy of emulation. At the same time, the Ningbo Party, government, military, police, and legal circles held a joint meeting and decided that the Yin County Government and the Ningbo Police Department should supervise the residents of the urban area to evacuate to the rural areas in accordance with the evacuation measures promulgated by the province.

### Various Sectors Change Business Hours

In order to prevent Japanese air raids, various industries in Ningbo have changed their business hours to night markets. The office hours of the Zhejiang Customs Service have also been changed to 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM. The business hours of the first-class post office on the north bank of Jiangbei have been changed to 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM. The bombed areas are all commercial downtown areas, so the Ningbo market is currently very depressed after this catastrophe, and the number of residents is decreasing day by day.

### French Embassy Military Attaché Leaves Shanghai for the North; Expected to Return to Shanghai After Several Weeks After Visiting Beiping and Other Places

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, Lieutenant Colonel Yifeng, Military Attaché of the French Embassy, left Shanghai yesterday (16th) morning for a trip to Beiping and other places in North China, and is expected to return to Shanghai after several weeks.

### The Municipal Council Holds a Special Meeting on the Fresh Meat Industry Crisis; Meat Merchants Throughout the City Quietly Await a Proper Resolution; If There is No Result, They Will Suspend Business for a Long Time

The Fresh Pork Industry Association, in the past two days, sent three representatives to visit the French Concession Board of Directors, the French Consul General in Shanghai, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession, and the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, the Public Concession Municipal Council Health Department, and Chinese Directors of the Board, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, etc., to report on the details of the illegal detention of pigs shipped to Shanghai and the forced closure of the meat market, and requested the concession authorities to deal with the aftermath in order to maintain the meat supply for millions of citizens in Shanghai. It is heard that the authorities of the two concessions believe that it is their responsibility to maintain the meat supply for the citizens, and they will consider it and seek reasonable and proper solutions. The Fresh Pork Industry has led the various industries and the fresh meat industry to strictly maintain order and quietly await the authorities to deal with the aftermath. If there are no concrete results, the industry tends to suspend business for a long time.

### Special Meeting for Detailed Discussion

The Shanghai Municipal Council will hold a special meeting (i.e., a board meeting) at 3:00 PM today to discuss in detail the crisis of the successive closure of the fresh meat industry throughout the city within the boundary that began on the 13th of this month. The Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has collected various information about the closure of the industry and prepared a report to be submitted at the special meeting. After the report, appropriate measures will be discussed in detail and studied for implementation so that the matter can be resolved as soon as possible.

### Smuggled Meat Outside the Boundary Plummets in Price

Since the slaughterhouses in the two concession areas have all stopped slaughtering (the Municipal Council slaughterhouse on Hongkou Sha Jing Road also slaughters intermittently), except for a small amount of fresh meat still being sold in the Public Concession area, the French Concession is completely devoid of meat. The meat used by various restaurants and catering businesses is purchased from the interior. At the same time, the smuggled meat slaughtered in Hongkou is hidden in cloth bags and directly sold to various restaurants. The prices are also inconsistent. As for the citizens within the boundary, they do not buy meat because the price of meat has skyrocketed. It is now learned that smuggled meat is rampant in the areas outside the boundary in Hongkou, Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai, and the price has plummeted. It is said that one yuan in legal tender can buy about three catties, but the residents in that area are wary of the pork because it does not have the inspection stamp of the Health Department and its source is unknown.

### The New Building of the Signs of the Times Newspaper is Completed

The Signs of the Times Newspaper, owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, is located at the corner of Huade Road and Ningguo Road in Yangshupu. It has been in operation for more than 30 years and is the largest self-established printing organization of the Christian Church in China. It publishes various religious books and magazines that reach deep into the people. The Signs of the Times Monthly has the widest circulation, with more than 65,000 subscribers per issue. In recent years, because the premises have become insufficient, the office and part of the translation bureau began to be demolished and rebuilt before August 13th. Work was suspended after the outbreak of the Shanghai war. The construction work was resumed last winter. At 3:00 PM on the 14th of this month, a completion ceremony for the new building was held. More than 300 Chinese and foreign guests attended. Pastor Ge Saifu led the prayer to open the meeting. Manager Xu reported on the construction of the new building. Mr. Xu Hua, Mr. Shi Dehan, Pastor Luo Wei Shuai, and Pastor Bai Rensen delivered speeches successively. Pastor Wang Fuyuan offered a prayer. After the ceremony, everyone took a photo. The staff of the museum led the guests to visit the printing factory and various parts of the new building, and tea and refreshments were served. The guests and hosts dispersed happily at 5:00 PM. The new building of the museum is a two-story steel-concrete structure. The upper floor is the translation office, the art department, the library, the reference room, and the historical data exhibition hall. The lower floor is the business department, the warehouse, and the dispatch department. It was built by the Renchang Construction Factory.

### Farewell Ceremony for the Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnell; To Be Held Tomorrow at the American Club; New Commander Rear Admiral Hottell Arrives in Shanghai in Mid-July

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the American community in Shanghai, gentry and merchants, and students from various American universities have scheduled a public banquet for Rear Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, at the American Club at 209 Fuzhou Road at 8:30 PM this Friday, with tea and dance entertainment. Rear Admiral Yarnell came to Shanghai in October 1936 to take up this position. His term of office expires at the end of June of this year. The U.S. government has selected Rear Admiral Hottell, former Chairman of the U.S. Naval Ships Board, to come to Shanghai to take over as the new commander.

### Japanese Newspapers Also Express Doubt About "Huaxing Bank" Banknotes, Saying They Don't Know What Method to Use to Force Circulation; Foreign Merchants Refuse to Accept Counterfeit Money

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, although the local managers of the "Huaxing Commercial Bank," which circulates "Hongkou currency," have repeatedly guaranteed that they do not intend to implement a foreign exchange and export control system, Japan does not believe this. Japanese newspapers seem to firmly believe that the Huaxing Bank naturally aims to establish a foreign exchange control system. The "Japan Times and Mail" recently published an editorial discussing the Huaxing Bank and its new currency, which included a passage such as: "The 'Reformed Government' will take what method to force the circulation of its banknotes is still unknown, but it is quite conceivable that the authorities in Central China will take the opportunity to have earnest negotiations with customs officials to establish a method of controlling foreign trade and foreign exchange. We, then, will not be able to completely force the circulation of its banknotes."

According to the Continental Times:

The "Huaxing Commercial Bank," controlled by the Japanese, began operations in Hongkou yesterday (16th). Bankers in the Public Concession and the French Concession have flatly ignored the bank's banknotes, so the new currency is circulating very little on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek. This currency appeared when the bank opened at 2 Duole'an Road. It is reported that various

Foreign Banks

Have refused to accept it, because if they accept it, it would be a violation of the 1935 agreement by major countries to recognize the Central Government's currency as the only legal tender. The Japanese may have asked foreign bankers to discuss general acceptance of

New Currency Plans,

But generally, foreign bankers refuse to indicate that they will respond to the Japanese plan. According to a banker, "We certainly cannot recognize these banknotes, nor do we want to deal with them. These banknotes are obviously issued by an agent organization fighting the National Government."

### The Japanese Side Claims That the Five Arrested Chinese Have Been Released; As of Yesterday Afternoon, None of the Five Had Returned Home; It is Said That the Japanese Have Tried to Induce Them with False Positions

According to the Shanghai Times, at yesterday's (16th) afternoon press conference, there was an inquiry about the fate of the five Chinese who were arrested by the Japanese military police at the Fulai Hotel on Guangxi Road and taken to Hongkou on the 9th of this month. A Japanese army spokesman told reporters that the five Chinese were no longer in the custody of the Japanese military police. When asked if they had been handed over to the Public Concession Police Department, the spokesman replied, "We believe they have regained their freedom." When asked if the spokesman could state

These Five Chinese

Were arrested by the Japanese military police, consular police, or marines on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, the spokesman replied, "They were arrested by the Japanese military police." When asked, "It was recently understood that the Municipal Council Police Department could act independently in the Public Concession. Is the Japanese action a violation of this understanding?" The spokesman replied, "The whole problem is

Inevitable

As a result of the situation. Usually, the Japanese military police cooperate with the Public Concession Police Department to arrest suspects. This special case occurred in a certain situation, making it impossible to notify the police department, which is quite regrettable." When asked what these situations were, the spokesman replied, "The time and place of the arrest were different from what was originally expected. This was due to a change in the actions of the arrested persons." When asked, "After

Implementation of the Arrest,

Was the police department immediately notified?" The spokesman replied, "We believe that the police department has been notified afterwards." When asked, "Has the release of the persons been notified to the police department?" According to the reply, "We believe that it has been notified." When asked, "The arrest of these five people and their subsequent release, is it due to a misunderstanding?" The spokesman said he did not know. When asked what the suspects were suspected of, the spokesman was also unable to say, but said that he believed that there were some

Sufficient Reasons

To do so. According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, although a Japanese military spokesman told reporters last night (16th) that the five Chinese arrested by plainclothes Japanese at the Fulai Hotel on May 9th have been released, according to investigations, as of noon today (17th), none of the arrested persons have returned home. Two days ago, it was reported that the Japanese authorities suddenly changed their attitude towards these five people,

No Longer Tormenting

Them to reveal information about their comrades. Their comrades are suspected of launching extensive guerrilla activities in the important Japanese army and navy bases of Baoshan and Wusong districts. It is also heard that the Japanese side is trying to induce them to take positions in the "Reformed Government." Investigation shows that

The Five Arrested

Are Jiang Hao, instructor of the Shanghai New Life Movement Federation; Chen Jiamo, magistrate of Baoshan County appointed by Chongqing; Su Liangru, chief of staff of the Shishan Guerrilla; Hong Guanghua, executive member of the Baoshan Party Department; and Wu Yiqing, former intelligence officer of the Songhu Garrison Command.

### Norwegian Community Celebrates Constitution Day, Banquet Held Yesterday

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Norwegian community in Shanghai will hold a banquet at the French Ball Club tonight (17th) to celebrate Norwegian Constitution Day. It is expected that there will be one hundred and thirty attendees. Norway is a

Hereditary Monarchical

Constitutional state in accordance with the constitution adopted on May 17, 1814. Norway was an independent country. After several centuries, it merged with the Danish Empire in 1381. Then, the Danish king concluded a treaty on January 14, 1814, ceding Norway to Sweden, but the Norwegian people themselves

Declared Independence

And elected a Danish prince as king. At that time, the great powers did not recognize it. As a result, the parliament declared the merger of Norway and Sweden on August 14, and elected the Swedish King Charles XIII as the King of Norway on November 4. In 1905, an agreement was reached to abolish the merger, a referendum was held, and the Danish Prince Charles was elected as king, ascended the throne, and was named Haakon VII.

### Wet, Itchy Toes and Ganlu; If You Have This Kind of Problem, You Should Pay Special Attention.

Ganlu effectively treats ringworm and sores. Its efficacy is well-known. What I want to say here is that Ganlu also has special effects on wet, itchy toes. Wet, itchy toes are caused by staphylococcus aureus. Wherever the bacteria go, small blisters will appear. The pain and itching are unbearable. Once scratched, the wet itching becomes worse. The more you scratch, the more it itches, until the skin breaks and bleeds. In severe cases, it is difficult to walk. In terms of treatment, one should pay attention to foot hygiene, washing at least once a day, and the other should use Ganlu lotion. Ganlu has a strong bactericidal agent. Only one drop is needed to penetrate the mucous membrane and eliminate the root cause. One bottle will cure the disease. "Ganlu" is produced by Shanghai Tongren Pharmaceutical Company. It is a leader in modern skin disease medicine. Those who have used it know that it is reliable and effective. It is sold in major pharmacies and western medicine departments of major companies.



### Case of Jealous Murder of Chen Tingsheng: Thorough Investigation Required; Significant Case Postponed for Prosecution; Men and Women in Audience Eager to See Adulterer and Adulteress

Chen Tingsheng, formerly known as Chen Sanzi, a Shanghainese residing at No. 39 Haig Lane, Haig Road, French Concession, Shanghai, aged 36, from Zhenjiang, had been living with Wang Guizhen (aged 34 this year) as lovers for 14 years. Because Wang, though past her prime, was still restless and promiscuous, she secretly became involved with Tao Boqing (nicknamed "Lalitou Boqing," aged 36 this year, from Shanghai), a Shanghainese from Xujiahui, forming a love triangle, which led to

Turbulence of Mistaken Love

Wang colluded with Tao and funded the hiring of Xing A'liu, Cao Quanfa, Wang Liansheng, and Shen Jinsheng, who carried handguns and kitchen knives to Chen's residence at 6 a.m. on March 20 of this year, killing Chen on the spot. After the incident was reported, the French police arrested Chen's lover, Wang Guizhen, and Tao Boqing. The murder weapon was found in a nearby trash can. Within ten days, French police detectives arrested

Murder Accomplices

Xing, Cao, Wang, and Shen, along with accomplices Yu Fugen, Wu A'gou, Shen Donglin, Zhu Miaoxiang, Song A'kun, Xu Yougen, and others, totaling 16 male and female suspects, seized a Mao-style handgun and five bullets, and sent them to the Second Special District Court for detention, requesting a detailed investigation before prosecution. It is now known that in addition to killing Chen Tingsheng, the defendants had committed over ten robberies within the French Concession. This case was scheduled for continued hearing yesterday morning, but due to overcrowding in the Central Police Station's detention center, the French police temporarily detained Tao and the other defendants in the Xavia and McLain police stations and failed to bring them to court. Therefore, the hearing was temporarily changed to the afternoon. At 2:30 p.m., Judge Liao Yuan presided over the criminal court and began the hearing after the police brought

The Defendants to Court

Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the French Concession administration, stated that there were many defendants in this case and that the police considered the case to be significant, requiring thorough investigation. Since the investigation was not yet complete, he requested a two-week extension for the hearing. The court verified the report and, without questioning, announced that the hearing would be postponed to 10 a.m. on May 31. The defendants were returned to custody. Since the occurrence of the incident, it has caused a sensation in Shanghai. Therefore, yesterday, nearly 200 men and women from Huaxi, Fahua, and Xujiahui areas of the French Concession went to court to observe, all wanting to see the demeanor of the adulteress Wang Guizhen and the lecher Tao Boqing. Wang and Tao remained calm, showing no signs of shock or fear. The families of the defendants also attended the hearing, their faces full of tears, watching as the defendants were returned to the police station.

### Detectives Plot to Arrest Drug Dealers: Alleging Purchase, Luring to Hotel for Arrest

Liu Zhaoshang, a Chinese detective of the Public Concession Narcotics Department, and detective Zhao Baosheng recently learned that someone was selling heroin. Therefore, they secretly sent Chang to contact "North" and falsely claimed to want to buy heroin. After several contacts, they agreed to meet at Room 215 of the Mengyuan Hotel on Hubei Road at 3:15 p.m. on the afternoon of the scheduled day for the exchange of goods. At the appointed time, Detective Liu and others rushed to wait and arrested five drug dealers from Ningbo, Zhu Changfu, Li Xichang, Wang Changgen, Zheng Baorong, and Shi Kunshan. They confiscated 21 and a half ounces of heroin. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoza, prosecuted them under Article 3 of the Narcotics Prohibition Law, requesting that they be punished according to the law. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, the defendants were ordered to be returned to custody to await a scheduled verdict.

### At the Home of a Naturalist: Appreciating for a Whole Morning (Part 2) EL

—Impressions from Visiting Mr. Souiad—

In the year of the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Souiad gathered nine armed Westerners to rescue missionaries trapped in Xi'an, organizing a group called the "Shaanxi Relief Expedition." Because Souiad was the leader of this expedition, it was also called "Souiad's Cavalry." They set off from Taiyuan, Shanxi, passed through northern Shaanxi, and reached Xi'an. Finally, they rescued over thirty missionaries, both male and female, who were trapped.

Regarding the above-mentioned event, Mr. Souiad wrote a detailed account of the rescue in the February issue of the "China Science and Art Magazine" two years ago. Mr. Souiad gave me a reprint of that article for reference. Because I had been to northern Shaanxi—which was once called the "Soviet Area"—I felt very interested. At that time, they took the route south of Yan'an, through Luochuan, Ganquan, and中部 (Zhongbu), and reached Xi'an. The article mentioned the "Qiaoling" in 中部—the mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor. It is no wonder that a person like Souiad, who loves archeology, would make a note of it here. Among foreigners who have been to northern Shaanxi, Mr. Souiad seems to have been there more than twenty years earlier than "Snow," "Smedley," and other "research communist writers"!

Mr. Souiad left China for the second time. During the European War in 1918, he was conscripted to Europe. He served as a translator at the headquarters of the Chinese labor corps in France. Because he was familiar with the situation in China, his duties focused on the criminal aspects. He returned to China in 1920 and traveled from north to south the following year, having been to the inland areas of Fujian.

In 1923, he came to Shanghai to found the "China Science and Art Magazine" and also served as the director of the museum, which is one of the main tasks of the Asian Literary Society. Mr. Souiad is truly an "expert" in the collection, processing, and preservation of specimens, and everything is within his capabilities. So he is most suitable for this work.

During the ten years after he came to Shanghai—in 1932, when the museum built a new building, many animal specimens inside were also "relocated" from the old boxes to the new "house." This work could only be done by experts. Those animals that have long been lifeless, but only have shells, or only have a certain "appearance," will be completely destroyed if they are not handled properly. Mr. Souiad spent a lot of effort to "repaint" the "facades" of these animal "mummies," making them one by one like what Shanghainese call "freshly活死人 (living dead)."

To make those soulless things look like they are still breathing.

The foam of the beer gradually disappeared with time, and the wine in our glasses had been reduced to a spoonful of water in an inkstone. Because my interviewing task had been completed, I said goodbye to Mr. Souiad with Mr. Morrison. I looked at my watch and realized that I had been there for an hour and a half without realizing it. When I first entered, Mr. Souiad and Morrison of the London Times were discussing the sensational珍兽 (rare animal) Panda—the giant panda—or white bear. (See illustration) Mr. Souiad has given me reference materials and photos. I have to write here that the project is huge, which is known without asking; and he can also "supplement" the scenery for the plumage and animals like an old painter. Behind the specimens of bears, deer, cranes, birds, etc., he either paints some mountains, rocks, and branches, or adds some bamboo leaves, shallows, and weeds. In short, as the end of this article:

The giant panda's English name is Giant Panda (scientific name is Ailuropoda Melanoleuca, David), produced in western China, such as Sichuan, Xikang, Tibet, etc. It was first discovered in 1869 by the famous missionary—naturalist David, at the border of Tibet, 73 years ago.

In 1916, Weierbo hunted a living giant panda in Tibet, but it died after a few days. In the same region, it was not until 1928 that two Mr. Roosevelts hunted a specimen. Later, in 1931 and 1934, Westerners hunted a small number again, but they were all lifeless specimens. The first living giant panda transported out of China was hunted in Tibet by Mrs. Harkness in 1936 and transported to the United States to be purchased by the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago. Later, Mrs. Harkness returned to China and hunted a young giant panda with a Chinese gentleman surnamed Yang. This happened in 1937. This little "cat" was still purchased by the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago for 8,700 US dollars (equivalent to more than 52,000 yuan in current legal tender). Its preciousness can be imagined. In short, there are very few living specimens in the world, and dead ones are also rarely seen.

Regarding the morphology of the giant panda, it is best to go to the museum on Museum Road to see it for yourself.

My personal impression: The animal's eyes and ears are all black. If you look at it from the front, it looks like a "four diamonds" playing card. Anyone who has played or seen playing cards must understand it. There is not much more to say. (End)

Giant Panda (Panda)

### General Meeting of the Yimiao Market Members: Resolved to Demand Rent Reduction; Store Base Area Reduced and Not Conforming to Drawings; The Market Side Shirk Responsibility and Prepare for Litigation

The Yimiao Market Business Association held a general meeting of members yesterday at the Pudong Building on the sixth floor. Wang Daren was elected as chairman and began discussing many proposals, such as unifying market prices for all stores, prohibiting the bad habit of bargaining, and urging the market side to improve sanitation and purchase fire-fighting equipment to ensure safety. Later, the discussion turned to the market's poor business, with many stores being transferred or sold, which was not a good sign, and how to maintain the business. Zhu Jinxiang, Jiang Zhigao, and others spoke in succession, all stating that when each store signed a rental agreement with the market side, the various facilities and standard sizes promoted by the market side, such as a special type of "12×16" and a type of "10×12," did not match reality. The special type of location was only "10×14," and the second type was only "8×10," which was a significant reduction. The members painfully paid huge tips, and the special monthly rent of 60 yuan required a three-month deposit, and the same was true for the second type with a monthly rent of 35 yuan. Now the size of the location suddenly does not match the original standard, and the rent should be reduced proportionally to be fair. However, after repeated negotiations, the market side has always shirked responsibility, with no practical response, and blamed the 工部局 (Municipal Council) for reducing the size when modifying the drawings, stating that it was not related to the market side. Regardless of whether it was reduced by the 工部局 (Municipal Council), in short, since the store space rented by the market side to each merchant has been reduced, the rent should be reduced accordingly. The original sample diagram only had sixteen rooms, but now seventeen rooms have been built, which shows that the market side disregards everything, only knows how to collect more rent, and only cares about profit, and it is feared that the 工部局 (Municipal Council) is also deceived by it. The members believe that because of the small size of the location, the decoration, the stacking of goods, and the inability to accommodate a large number of customers, this kind of damage, from a legal point of view, is the so-called loss of part of the leased property, and the market side should be responsible. Now that the request for rent reduction has not been granted, a further serious expression should be made. At that time, the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense. Finally, the chairman persuaded them to aim for peaceful struggle. The case was resolved in three points: (A) Publish a statement of the process in the newspaper and appeal to all sectors to uphold justice; (B) Elect representatives to petition various agencies and public groups for mediation; (C) The final goal is to resort to legal resolution. It was also decided that from now on, all members' rent will be deposited in the bank to await the final resolution and prepare for litigation. It was agreed to share all litigation costs. This was unanimously approved by all members and signed by all to show seriousness. Finally, executive and supervisory committee members were elected, with Jiang Zhigao, Zhang Chuanling, Zhang Renfan, Chen Qinhe, Wu Jifang, Shao Jinbao, and Zhang Rongde being elected by a majority vote. The meeting adjourned after the ceremony.

### Social Miscellany

Woman Run Over: At 5:30 p.m. yesterday, truck number 40339 was driving to the entrance of Alley 280 on Saposai Road, when Li Mingzhu, a woman from Hubei, was on her way to visit relatives from her residence at No. 594 Laoshenfu Road. Just as she was about to enter the alley, the truck was approaching head-on. Due to the inability to brake in time, the woman was knocked down, causing her right arm to be severely crushed by the wheels. The police on duty arranged for her to be sent to the hospital for treatment. After examination, it was revealed that her arm had been broken. Even if she recovers, she may be disabled.

She was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment by car. (2) Yesterday afternoon at around 2 p.m., Zhang Wang'shi, a young woman, aged 22, because her husband was missing and her life felt very difficult to support, suddenly had the idea of dying and threw herself into the river at Pentang Lane Bridge. She was rescued by someone and sent to the refugee hospital at No. 240 Simon Road for treatment by car.

Theft Cases Recorded: (1) At 11:20 a.m. yesterday morning, the Rongyu Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 101 Huaji Road, Yangshupu, was suddenly visited by five thieves, holding three handguns, who broke in to rob under the pretext of buying cigarettes.

At around 5 p.m. yesterday, he suddenly had the thought of ending his life and stabbed himself in the throat with a sharp knife, falling to the ground and bleeding profusely. The shop sent someone to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. His injuries were severe, and his life was in danger.

### Residents of Qingyu Lane Petition: Requesting the Court to Suspend Execution; Water Cut Off in the Entire Lane, Public Panic; Court Orders Summer Relocation in Batches

The dispute over the demolition of houses in Qingyu Lane on Xinzhongqing Road has caused unease among the residents because the Women's Bank rejected the mediation of Hua Dong Yu Qiaqing and others. Considering that the Women's Bank hired more than 100 workers on the 11th to demolish the houses, causing disputes, an emergency meeting was convened, and it was decided to strengthen self-defense, organize defense teams and disciplinary teams, and petition teams. The defense team is responsible for managing the iron gates of each lane, the disciplinary team is responsible for maintaining the competition for water, and the petition team led more than 480 homeowners from each lane to the First Special District Court yesterday morning to petition, requesting a temporary suspension of execution for rescue. It is also heard that the court has sent bailiff Mao to notify Ma Huaqing, Luo Jinong, Zhang Keyao, Bai Shinong, Shi Genghua, Zhang Zhongying, and six other families, ordering them to relocate within 24 days.

### Rampant Bandits in the Pseudo-Police Area

Openly Carrying Weapons, Lawless; A Silk Weaving Factory Robbed Clean

There is a vacant lot of more than ten acres at the end of a small alley opposite Zhaofeng Park in Fanhuangdu, West Shanghai, which was rented by a incense candle shop on Xinzha Aiwenyi Road to build a reed shed to manufacture incense candles. There was still some space left, which was subleased to others to make a silk weaving factory. This place is in a occupied area, although it is close to the road built beyond the boundary, the police are not able to guard it. Japanese troops are only stationed along the railway, and the pseudo-police have no time to take care of local security, causing large and small factories in the area to be肆刦 (wantonly robbed) by local bandits. They even dared to openly send letters to various factories extorting protection fees. Although the manufacturers paid protection fees monthly for the sake of peace, bandits still came in groups at night to捻刦 (rob) the property. Merchants and residents dared not live in peace. The Mingji Silk Weaving Factory, attached to the incense candle factory, has been robbed three times by bandits in the past month. All the property has been robbed, leaving only twelve looms. It has long stopped working, and the workers have scattered. Only two old stewards and an accountant surnamed Zhao are stationed in the factory to guard the machinery, preparing to move into the concession in the near future and seek to resume work. Unexpectedly, at around 9 p.m. the night before last (the 16th), more than ten bandits came in two trucks, openly carrying weapons and showing handguns. They moved all twelve looms and motors onto the trucks and drove north under the escort of the bandits. All miscellaneous items were洗刦 (robbed clean) without leaving anything behind.

### Shanghai Telephone Company: Distributing Dividends

According to the announcement published by the Shanghai Telephone Company today, the company will now distribute dividends for 1938 and will allocate the surplus amount to capital. The dividend is 4.25 yuan in national currency for each share with a face value of 50 taels of silver, equivalent to about 6.08%. It will be paid from the 3rd of next month to the shareholders registered in the shareholder register before 5 p.m. on May 22, 1939. As for the conversion of the surplus amount into capital, the existing shares with a face value of 50 taels of silver each will be converted into ten shares with a face value of 10 yuan in national currency each, so as to eliminate the old silver system and reduce the face value. Moreover, the company's business is expanding, and it is necessary to retain the company's financial resources. Therefore, the board of directors believes that it is better to convert a portion of the surplus amount into capital, increase the number of shares, and distribute them to the shareholders. A special shareholders meeting will be convened in New York on June 26, 1939, to propose a change in the company's registered capital and authorize the conversion of the existing shares of 50 taels each into ten shares of 10 yuan each. If this proposal is approved by a majority, the shareholders will have the opportunity to exchange the old shares for new shares in proportion. All shareholders registered in the shareholder register before 5 p.m. on May 22, 1939, have the right to be notified and vote at the special shareholders meeting. Notices and proxies will be sent to the above-mentioned shareholders after May 22. Therefore, if any shareholders have changed their address and have not notified the telephone company, please notify the company immediately, so that dividends and notices can be accurately received without error.

### How Can Couples Always Love Each Other?

There are so many unfortunate facts like this. When a young couple is in love, how much they are in love with each other, how sweet and happy they are, they can't wait to get married as soon as possible to fulfill their wishes. But once married, how long does it take for their interests to suddenly decrease, their love gradually disappears, and even conflicts arise, and the couple is like an enemy. Marriage is the tomb of love, isn't this what many married men and women are saying? Although the saying goes, "Quarreling on the bow of the boat, talking on the stern of the boat," treats quarrels between couples as normal, in fact, many unfortunate events between couples start from small things or from very ordinary things. This is what husbands should pay attention to, so how to "prevent problems before they occur" and make couples always love each other?

We know that "if you don't advance, you retreat, if you don't live, you die." is the principle of all things. The same is true for love. In other words: love between couples also needs continuous creation and growth. If you think that men and women are already married, love has been solidified, and their identities have been determined, and you don't pay attention to the work of growth and creation, then there is no one who does not have sadness in love! However, the continuous growth and creation of love is completely based on abundant energy. One point of energy, one point of career; one point of energy is even one point of love. Not only the arrangement of the family, the education of children, all need energy to deal with, but also in the life of the couple, abundant energy is needed, so that they can cope with ease, so that love is coordinated and happiness is increased. If you can permanently maintain the strength of your energy, the couple will naturally be able to love each other forever, give birth to sons and daughters, and grow old together. But if a man commits masturbation and seminal emission in his early years, or indulges in promiscuity after marriage, causing energy loss, or even bursts of spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm infertility, neurasthenia and other symptoms, then not only the琐琐 of the family, will feel unbearable suffering, and in the life of the couple will not be satisfactory, hated by his wife, therefore, all the tragedies of勃谿, quarrels, divorce, suicide, etc. will emerge, the couple is regarded as a thorn in the eye, the family forms a tragic hell, the pain of life, must be fundamentally cured of their diseases. The method of treatment, according to the world's famous doctors' thousands of clinical cases, and my more than ten years of experience at home and abroad, are to take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone", which is the most effective for the symptoms. It is sincere that this agent is extracted from the essence of the reproductive glands of strong animals such as apes and sea dogs, and is replicated by scientific methods, so the quality is valuable, the medicinal properties are peaceful and thorough, and the efficacy is accurate and great. After taking it, it can produce sperm to nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, nourish the nerves, and promote the development function, and invigorate the metabolism within one day and night. Continuous use can make the efficacy even more significant, and it will definitely be able to fundamentally cure the above symptoms in a short period of time. Only those with seminal emission need to take "Himitsu's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" at the same time to consolidate the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that the symptoms and the root cause can be treated at the same time, and the effect is faster.

### The Shortcut to Health for Seminal Emission Youth

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Because of our loud appeals, the youth in the spring love initiation period should know to be vigilant! Masturbation is the worst bad habit, do not try it, because one try has a tendency to commit it twice. After three or four times of bad habits are formed, it is difficult to seek correction. There are many enlightened young people who know that masturbation is harmful and have quit once, but soon relapse, which is why they are dominated by bad habits. Therefore, those who already have bad habits must use the greatest determination and the greatest effort to extricate themselves from the crisis. If the sexual function is destroyed due to masturbation indulgence, and seminal emission follows, then it must be treated thoroughly as soon as possible, otherwise there will be endless troubles! Because semen in my human body functions to regulate metabolism, assist development function, and characters each part of the nerves. If seminal emission is not treated and the number of times is frequent, or the symptoms worsen and cause spermatorrhea, because too much semen is lost, then all the pathological states such as brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, restlessness, occasional headaches, physical fatigue, back pain, soreness in the waist, premature ejaculation, impotence, and scattered energy will follow. At the same time, the development function stagnates, and the whole body and local parts are short and surpass the constant, just like childhood. There are too many residual substances in the body, and the production of new cells decreases, forming a yellow and thin face and a state of premature aging. May I ask if this kind of youth is dying and sick, how can they seek to study and explore the light of the future. Even in the life of the couple, it is not satisfactory, hated by his wife, or there are no children, leaving lifelong regrets! To treat seminal emission, one must clear one's heart and reduce desires, pay attention to health, but at the same time, one must take the special medicine "Himitsu's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves, so that one can sleep peacefully at night, and seminal emission will be cured. If the above-mentioned symptoms have been caused by seminal emission, one must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" (available in major pharmacies such as China & Western and Wuzhou) to nourish the brain, kidneys, and nerves, and increase sperm and blood. Then it will definitely be able to fundamentally cure it in a short period of time. If the patient can come to this clinic in person for expert physician diagnosis, and then apply electrotherapy injection and other methods, the cure will be even faster.

Beauty

### The Breasts Control Everything About Women

— Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine

In a state of perfect development, every young woman should have a youthful and beautiful posture in her youth. A slender figure, obvious curves, and especially a pair of full and towering breasts, bulging in thin clothes. Forming two small hills, standing side by side, with a deep concave pattern in the middle, shaking up and down together during movement, symbolizing the ripples in the river, gently lifting the clothes in front of the chest. How wonderful and moving is this! In addition, ruddy cheeks, delicate skin, lively and energetic eyes, black hair like clouds, a smiling full facial expression, and plump and flexible buttocks are of course all necessary. However, this kind of posture still needs to be set off by towering breasts, so that it is like green leaves of peony, complementing each other. If the development of the breasts is unfortunately hindered by menstrual disorders, lingering leucorrhea, malnutrition, anemia, masturbation and other symptoms, resulting in atrophy or flatness like a man's. Then, even if wearing brocade clothes and fine clothes, it is still inevitable to be laughed at by those who know, or even lose the love between the couple because of this, which is also a very common thing, and want to seek remedy. Only by trusting science, according to the research and experimental results of the world's famous gynecological experts Dr. Kantelin and French beauty expert Dr. Wei Niqi, etc. They all believe that taking the ovarian preparation for women "Reproductive Hormone" is the most symptomatic and effective. The atrophy of women's breasts is completely due to the dysfunction of the reproductive gland ovary. If "Reproductive Hormone", which is refined from the essence of the ovaries of strong animals, is taken at this time, then it will naturally respond like a sound. Within one day and night, it can exert its great medicinal power, regulate menstruation, warm the palace and stop the belt. If you continue to take it, not only can it make the atrophied breasts stand tall in a short period of time, but also promote pregnancy function, increase blood elements, and prolong youth.

### What Method is the Easiest to Eradicate Gonorrhea?

Gonorrhea is difficult to treat, which is a well-known thing for ordinary people, but in fact, they do not know that it is also an easy-to-treat disease. Many symptoms of gonorrhea are intricate and changeable, and the methods of treating gonorrhea are also different between the old and the new. The old doctors never saw what gonorrhea was, so naturally they could not talk about any treatment methods, which is solid. But the average new doctor also often gets into trouble with gonorrhea, which is also not uncommon. But it is not true. If the onset of gonorrhea is easy to treat, it is because the disease is not deep into the ear. If the treatment method is not appropriate, then this easy-to-treat acute gonorrhea will not become chronic gonorrhea. How many people in the world suffer from chronic gonorrhea are countless, and their initial solid has not passed through acute gonorrhea. Therefore, it is not appropriate to say that acute gonorrhea is easy to treat. However, it is not appropriate to say that chronic gonorrhea is difficult to treat. In the past ten years, I have cured no less than thousands of chronic patients. If it is said that it is difficult to treat, why do I have so many achievements that I have actually cured, and most of them have been proven by the Sanitary Office of the Engineering Bureau to be free of gonorrhea, and have never recurred. In short, the treatment of acute and chronic leucorrhea, if the diagnosis is accurate and the treatment method is right for the symptoms, is an easy-to-treat venereal disease.

Now, let's take acute prostatitis in acute gonorrhea and urethral stricture in chronic gonorrhea as examples. Acute prostatitis. After accurate diagnosis, a special autologous vaccine can be injected, and cooling or warm compress methods on the anus, and sitz bath methods such as warm bath enemas can be applied according to the symptoms. The swelling of acute prostatitis can be reduced within one or two days. If it is a gonorrheal stenosis, you can use David's retention. If it is so full that it is about to burst, you can quickly perform surgery to urinate to prevent uremia. At this time, it is all in the doctor's quick hands and eyes, so that extremely dangerous gonorrhea can be cured in a very short period of time. For these symptoms, in terms of electrotherapy, the German lymph-filtering DC therapy is particularly effective. For all these acute and chronic gonorrhea, if general mediocre therapy and doctors with limited knowledge are used, they will definitely not be cured in a short period of time.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Rapidly Rebound; Telephone Stock Rises to $92

Shanghai Cotton Mill Stock Dividend: $3.75; Rubber Stock Prospects are Quite Exciting

The securities black market suddenly experienced an unexpected turnaround yesterday, exceeding general expectations. Due to various rumors, there was further news yesterday, and many parties took the opportunity to push prices up, triggering a large number of short covering. Tiansheng and No. 20 fought hard. At the opening, investor confidence was still low, similar to the price of the previous day. Later, Tiansheng actively bought, followed by Nos. 20, 41, and others, as well as Tongkang, Sankai, Xieda, Yongfeng, and many retail investors covering their short positions. Although Dafeng consistently sold, and Zhenkang, Gongmao, Yongkang, Hengfu, and No. 42 successively supplied, prices rose sharply, and sellers sold at favorable prices.

In the afternoon, Qiafeng, Xieda, Tiansheng, and Datong continued to buy, while Tongkang, Lianhe, and No. 41 sold, further increasing market prices by 0.2-0.3 yuan. As a result, prices rose by 1-1.65 yuan. The total transaction volume was over one million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of Shanghai Cotton Exchange stock were traded at a price of 39.75 yuan, slightly firmer than before.

The British-owned Union Dock Company, originally a joint venture between Yeeson and Ruirong Docks, decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay an interim dividend of 5% per annum.

The Shanghai Cotton Mill Company Limited, a Japanese company in the local market, announced yesterday's tenth (semi-annual ending at the end of April of this year) business situation by the board of directors. The total amount of profit and loss was 3,189,106.71 yuan.

The London prices for shares of various British-owned Far Eastern companies on the 16th of this month (Tuesday) showed that only the price of Gurakh Lin Rubber rose by 0.075 shillings to 18.125 shillings. The rest did not fluctuate.

The London market for Chinese foreign debt was calm on the 16th of this month (Tuesday). The listed prices showed no change.

The Public Works Bureau reported that market sentiment was extremely focused on the outcome of the Rubber Restriction of Production Committee meeting. Since the meeting decided to increase production by 5% in the third quarter (from 50% to 55%), sentiment was very satisfied. Prices of raw rubber in London and New York also rose sharply. The 5% increase in production will only increase supply by 6,000 tons per month, which has little to do with the recent rate of inventory reduction. According to a recent American report, rubber inventories decreased by 15,000 tons in April, leaving a total inventory of only 190,900 tons, the lowest level in many years. In order to deal with this situation, the US government has only the barter agreement method available. Therefore, the rubber stock market was very active yesterday. Rubber Trust shares and Keyworth shares were in high demand.

Industrial stocks also showed significant progress, with more buyers than sellers. Jardine Matheson shares rebounded to 18.6 yuan. Telephone shares rose sharply to 92 yuan, as it was reported that the company would soon distribute dividends and bonuses. Ruirong shares were more stable at 7.75 yuan, as were Hutchison Whampoa shares at 35.75 yuan.

In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market opened higher due to good news from the Bombay cotton market and Liverpool, as well as a large number of new buyers and the last squeeze of shorts in May. High spot prices in the southern cotton region were also a reason for the New York price increase. The number of spot goods on the market is decreasing daily, so July alone rose by 12 pounds. Yesterday, India's forecast remained unchanged, and rose 6-7 pounds. Converting to legal tender, American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by more than one yuan per dan, Egyptian cotton rose by 0.9 yuan, and Indian cotton remained unchanged.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade was very quiet. Both Chinese and foreign factories had no orders. However, trading among fellow merchants was still lively. Yesterday, Brazilian cotton was in short supply in the local market, and reports came back about rising prices, so yesterday fellow merchants only ordered 2,000 bales of Brazilian cotton. Although Indian cotton has risen for several days in a row, it is still cheap when calculated by coarse fleece, so 3,000 bales were also ordered yesterday. The following is a list of yesterday's cotton market prices converted to factory delivery prices.

National Cloth

The Guangdong Group added nearly one hundred pieces of white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twills with the Dapeng, Fugui, and Flying Swan brands.

There were about sixty or seventy cases, and over one hundred pieces of coarse cloths and coarse twills from factories such as Jardine Matheson Factory. The mainland groups' trade in disassembled goods continued unabated, while retail transactions sharply decreased. Sichuan-Guizhou new product purchases remained weak. The Shanghai-Vietnam and Vietnam-Yunnan transport remained extremely crowded. It was recently heard that postal packages will resume sending. The various Shanghai Zhuang were hurrying to prepare and pack, storing up to be sent, so there were continued small transactions. On the 18th, there were thirty-five pieces of cloth being shipped to Tianjin.

The yarn market has not shaken off its hesitant ways, and the mood is extremely mild, since the environment is unremarkable, and also there is a segment of fellow merchants whose thoughts have become increasingly disinterested, since their prices have spun around the high end, as for the actual need, although it is said to be unsparing, except for the Guangdong and Fujian groups of South China that continue their purchasing without interruption, there is absolutely no possibility of any other groups rising, because the roads are congested and impassable, and it is difficult to transport, moreover, lately, the amount of yarn purchased by the Fujian and Hong Kong groups has been particularly huge, and after this batch of goods has been transported, for the time being, it is feared that there will not be a business that quickly returns, because of this original reason, the people's mood is peaceful and one step too, so mostly all adopt a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting obvious future changes, before starting to advance and retreat, at present, the market state becomes increasingly reluctant to advance,

The situation of present yarn: Opening the market in the early morning, the market situation is plain, without any exciting states, the business relies exclusively on the Southern route, apart from this, there is no great enthusiasm, the opening prices continue to exhibit a fatigued image. Because the Shantou group had buying interest for 20 count Tiannu, the price rose by one or two yuan. Shuangma was plain, the price was 431 yuan, rising by two yuan, but the stacking ticket price was plain. After a short while, the customer groups purchasing volumes allow stagnation, and they do not act in a proactive, abrupt purchase way, so many floated and sold on the allowance, the selling price gradually decreased. By the time of market close, the Shuangma outside stacking price was 428 yuan, the stacking ticket was 418.5 yuan, however, 32 count single yarn, the Chao-Shantou groups searched without ceasing, the market price maintained a firm high. The market situation was lackluster in the afternoon opening, the transactions were not robust, the trading that fellow merchants did mutually greatly decreased, therefore, the market spirit slackened. The Shuangma present sales price fell by one yuan, to be 427.5 yuan, the stacking ticket price rose 0.5 yuan to be 119 yuan, there were not many changes midstream, but at the market close the price returned and rose by one yuan again, the Shuangma present goods price was 428.5 yuan, it was verified that all the groups in the whole day bought a total of 1,360 bales. The market quotation twenty count Shuangma rose 0.5 yuan, Tiannu was plain, Shuang Diqiu fell by one yuan, only 32 count five widths rose by two yuan, others were stable, today there are 250 pieces of cotton yarn being transported to Tianjin, 34 pieces are transported to Yantai, now I will list the amounts that the various groups bought separately as on the left,

Fellow Merchants 655 Yunnan 130

Shantou 195 Hong Kong 300

Sichuan 35 Mainland 45

Total 1,360

The Japanese yarn market, as before, lacks energy, the sales roads of all sides are dull, according to the market words, the merchants and commercial firms of Japan in the outer guerrilla areas, all set up branch houses for resale, and the stocks of Japanese yarn in all places are sufficient, at present, they exclusively rely on the business on this street, because of this, the market price is not vigorous, the price of 20 count Yueqin is 358-359 yuan, the light of dropping two or three yuan compared with the previous day,

### Foreign Cotton Selling Prices Rise Daily; Domestic Cotton Trading Shows a Slight Uptick

Domestic cotton business is gradually developing an image, this is because for the last two days, the foreign cotton conversion price is step by step heading high, due to this, domestic cotton has quite a few rising states, trading among fellow merchants, turned and passed to the factories amounts, so the selling prices are trending up, the market price for goods with higher quality fiber from Tongzhou are allowed to be high, the source from Northern Jiangsu is still difficult, and the goods arriving are few, yesterday there were only 50 bales of Tonghua arriving, the current cotton situation is recorded to the left,

Dong Pi

The market spirits continue to be soft. The prices of New Cloth and fine twills are down 0.05-0.1 yuan per piece. The price for twelve-pound Dragon Head and Colorful Ball fine cloth is 13.7 yuan, and next month's futures are 13.8 yuan. The Loudspeaker Fine Cloth has already fallen to 13.5 yuan. The Tianjin Group is investigating 110 or so packages of Dragon Head Fine Cloth. The Wood Street intentions are lackluster and sluggish. The total number of fine cloth and fine twill transactions for the entire day is only 4-500 pieces.

### Yellow Drill in Short Supply

Yesterday's wholesale transactions of summer woolen fabrics were large, and Shen products such as Hongkang Yongxing's white Zhigong and white serge, and Yihuo's striped, checkered, and solid-colored feather yarn, were all in greater demand than supply. The recent actual sales of yellow drill have increased greatly, but the market inventory is noticeably short. This is because the number of British goods arriving is limited, the number of Eastern goods imported is few, and the number of national goods produced by Dafeng is not sustained. As a result, supply cannot meet demand, and market prices are rising rapidly. Yesterday, Xiangda, Desheng, and Qi opened at one yuan, Haohua at 1.25 yuan, Eastern goods Yiji's first number shouted at 0.825 yuan, Tongjun brand rose to 0.725 yuan, Dafeng Yipin picture sold for 30 yuan per piece, and Qizi Naoyuanxiao sold for 27.5 yuan, but there was still a lack of stock.

### Food: Flour Trade Sluggish

Factory Flour

Yesterday, the market situation for current flour from this factory was completely uninteresting, because the customer sales have long lacked whole batch sales strength, the Hebei and Shandong Groups, all use legal tender and fake notes problems, with changes occurring in all directions, therefore they have stopped purchasing one after another, resulting in the flour sales area of Northern China changing into an extremely quiet state, various factories assess that now the customer sales are already difficult to expand, and they are also unwilling to compromise in order to try to sell, only the Zhong Jue brand floating on the market had a small reduction, while the No. 2 flour factory dish still needs 4.55 yuan for the original dish, new sales in both the Southern and Northern groups were only several thousands of bags, and the 10,000 or so packages that were handled by this street's mainland and other places, the market surface showed extreme solitude. Today 1,000 bags of wheat flour are being shipped to Quan Yang.

Foreign Flour

The market was also quiet yesterday, it was verified that the production price in foreign countries was stable and firm, the futures were already completely cleared, and the new arriving goods also feel a lack, during the weak sales period of the Northern group, the supply and demand on the market were both silent, and there was hardly any formal market to speak of, the goods-selling parties, assessing that the factory flour was already loosening a price allowance, the foreign flour selling price also firmly held that they would not sell at a loss, it was heard that the price for sporadic sales by this street's Bat and Double Eagle brands, was 4.5 yuan, about the same as the original flour, however, it was heard that one more boat of Australia's wheat is entering, and the future of flour wheat, not without a collateral influence,

Du Geng - Yesterday, the common sources of all groups on the river below arrived at Songjiang and Nanhang seven, the tire and bun packages arriving at the dock had the Su Tong Kun Group's 3,5-3,600 packages, the overall market surface abruptly changed back to vigorous, the transactions were extremely frequent, at the same time, the black market went every which way, already rising one or two jiao, it was heard that common Geng was again out at 17 yuan a zero, while Jiangyin and Xi Geng were also around 17 yuan, compared to the old Dou, it was already at around 20 yuan, Suzhou 16.3 yuan, Tongli 16.2 yuan, Pingwang and Lilli also felt the same, Gao Bao Dao 16.2-16.3 yuan, the goods from the river below was at 15.7-15.8 yuan, Yangjian was also out a zero at 16 yuan, the customer price route all saw a note of 6, the market price increased two jiao, and the vision was especially chaotic, Du Bo Jian price was 15 yuan, Bai Yuan was still guarded by the original dish, the rest such as Jue goods was still within the limited line, it was verified that the market surface turning back to chaos, was in fact because the Huaxing Bank issued fake notes, the heart of the people has been affected by this,

Ke Xian - The sources were constantly flowing, and the market surface was already level, yet yesterday there were suddenly insiders and outside hoarders who were struggling to handle matters with this street, the market again had rumors of problems occurring with the Wuhu wheel transport, due to this, the market form suddenly tightened, the amount of transactions also increased to the range of 6,000 packages, while Nanjing Gao Xian was actually out at 15 yuan, Wu Gao Xian was also at 14.7-14.8 yuan, increasing two or three jiao compared with the previous market surface, Zhong Jue uniformly followed, only the foreign rice entering and exiting were both few, the market situation also had no change Yang Yuan, then continuing level,

### Silk and Tea: Amount of Silkworms Raised in Japan Decreases; Mulberry Trees in the Occupied Areas are Cut Down; Shanghai Silk Factories are Desperate and Choose Anything

According to a Yokohama phone message from a certain foreign firm yesterday, the amount of silk produced from silkworms in Japan this spring is bound to decrease sharply. It is understood that the current amount of silkworms raised has decreased to the lowest limit of 20%, and in reality it may exceed this. In addition, Father, the silk price in the Eastern market has recently increased daily, and the silk sales have not been smooth. The Yokohama American silk sales market has not been tense due to the rising silk price. On the contrary, the trading of Yokohama raw silk exporters feels very quiet. Therefore, the rising silk price lately, caused by the shadow of Japanese currency, is even more of a strong piece of evidence.

Also it is heard that recently from those in the occupied areas, around the Shanghai-Hangzhou line and each village, most of the mulberry fields have been cut down. Yet the mulberry leaves near Haining are strangely cheap, estimated at only 0.3 yuan per set (assessed to have three to four yuan per hour, and as high as eight yuan during lively times). What should be paid deep attention is Haining is by no means an area rich in mulberry leaves. In other words, Haining is at peace with the daily reliance on an outside supply of mulberry leaves before it is possible to adequately supply the demands of silkworm raising. Therefore, the mulberry leaves near Haining this year are strangely cheap and prove sufficiently that the inner-ground silkworm industry has already been destroyed for the most part by artillery fire. Also it is heard that certain of Shanghai's silk factories, of which a certain number of factories are attempting to cooperate with the false side to collect cocoons, therefore the cocoon merchants in the inner-ground are still continuing to wreck the trade. (C)

### Italian Artificial Silk Arrives in Shanghai, Estimated to Have 820 Cases

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Beans Plain, Common, and Without Energy

Recently, yellow beans sales were large on the street, and there were only a few transactions in the mainland. Exports, due to the situation, were cut off and continued intermittently, the sources although did not have a large batch arriving at the wharf, but the high priced long distance goods, in the end were also not few, therefore, the market mood was common and plain. A Japanese merchant sold 150 packages of Hankou Zha beans, with the price at 8.4 yuan. There has been an annual deficiency in the supply of these beans for over a year.

There was not much change in the flat branches.

### Hardware: Yellow Brass Skins' Actual Sales Are Still Smooth

The yellow brass skin trade is mostly made with merchants on Changjiang Road. Since the military, the sales on that road stopped. Now the market only has local factories, (such as thermos factories, machine factories, flashlight factories, and brass shops), and Tianjin merchants. Other merchants from Qingdao, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, and Ningbo all have sales, but the numbers are limited. However, not many new goods are being loaded and the bottom holdings are thin, so the opening prices are very firm. No. 22 flower type sells for 110 yuan per dan, No. 20 sells for 111 yuan, No. 18 111.5 yuan, No. 16 113 yuan, No. 14 115 yuan, and No. 12 sells for 120 yuan because of the small number of present goods.

They have already arrived at the pier, but recently there have been numerous miscellaneous fees. The water bill adds up to three corners, and the sales are declining. The reserves are still abundant, so the new goods have all been placed on the wharf and will not be sold for the time being. This is to maintain the outer strength and inner weakness of the market. The old goods of Grade A charcoal are still sold for 3.3 yuan, but the black market is weak and has already fallen back two corners.

Clothing, Food, Housing and Transportation

### The Physiognomy of Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Bao Bing

Physiognomy can also be interpreted as etiquette. The physiognomy discussed here is entirely related to clothing, food, housing, and transportation. It can also be said that it is discussing the physiognomy of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Therefore, what is discussed is nothing more than rules and etiquette, not the fortunes and longevity discussed by physiognomists. If you say that the physiognomy of clothing, food, housing, and transportation is also related to fortunes and longevity, then I am ashamed to not be a disciple of Liu Zhuang or Ma Yi, and I must leave that out.

Clothing Physiognomy　The most important points of clothing physiognomy are fitting well, being appropriate for the season, and being clean. As for the price of clothing materials, it can be determined according to one's own circumstances. In fact, according to frugality, it is not necessary to wear expensive clothes. Even if you wear a cloth garment, if it fits well, is appropriate for the season, and is clean, it also shows your personality and earns you respect. If expensive clothes are tailored in strange shapes and are full of dirt, people will despise you. Other things to pay attention to include fully buttoning your buttons, keeping your collar neat, and keeping your shoes and trousers clean.

Food Physiognomy　Food physiognomy, however, shows your temperament and character. It is generally believed that when eating, especially during banquets, one should be polite and share with others. If you have a large appetite, you can gobble it down and fill your stomach. However, you should pay attention to not taking up others' seats or hindering others, not only eating the most expensive dishes, not chewing loudly when eating, which is annoying, not splashing soup and dishes on the table, and not leaving rice grains in the bowl. Do not drink too much alcohol, so that you lose your manners after getting drunk. This kind of food physiognomy should be the case at banquets, and also in the family. This should also be used to teach children, so as to cultivate their good habits.

Transportation Physiognomy　As the saying goes, "Walking like tangled hemp," this is indeed something to avoid. When we walk, if it is not for sightseeing or a leisurely stroll, we should take speed, straightness, and uprightness as the criteria. The most taboo things are walking slowly, looking around, and walking crookedly. You must know that time is precious, and maintaining an upright posture can also promote your health. Westerners walk with speed, straightness, and uprightness, which are their good habits, and at the same time, it also shows their physical health. Other things to pay attention to in transportation physiognomy include walking on the left, walking with friends, keeping pace, and not spitting while walking.

Housing Physiognomy　The so-called housing physiognomy, in addition to maintaining proper and harmonious behavior in our daily life in the family, such as not being too indulgent or too stern, the furnishings of the home also belong to housing physiognomy. Speaking of home furnishings, like clothes, it is not necessary to have wealthy appliances. The most important thing is neatness and cleanliness. And like those of us who live in Shanghai and are in the salary stage, in addition to neatness and cleanliness, we must also strive for simplicity. Those appliances that are only for show and not practical can be saved. As long as you furnish your home in an orderly manner and keep your windows and tables clean, when people come into your house, they will have a very good impression, and they will respect your character.

### The Cost of a Garden

— Zhuo Dai

Although a garden is an extremely important thing in a family, some people often think that creating a garden is such a luxurious thing that ordinary people cannot afford it. In fact, it is not necessarily so. The so-called garden can be large or small, simple or complex. Of course, a large one can cost hundreds of thousands or millions without limit, while a small one can actually be built for tens of dollars, so creating a garden is not difficult.

In European and American countries, a garden is sometimes called an "outdoor room," which is to tell people to treat it like a house and not to shrink in the house all day long, but also to sit outdoors, so it is also a part of the living room. Calling it an outdoor room, and living in this outdoor room, can achieve the real purpose of creating this garden. At most, it costs about ten yuan, which is two-thirds cheaper than foreign goods, and it will not be because of this reason that a large garden that costs hundreds of thousands or millions to build is large but useless. It is better than those small gardens that cost hundreds or tens of yuan, which families can use as part of their living room and often live in.

If a new-style family has the motivation to build a garden for the sake of the family's health and enjoyment, do not think that a garden is very luxurious and cannot be built without preparing a large sum of money. You must know that not only is the cost of a small and simple garden extremely cheap, but also the way to build a garden is like writing, there are also regular script, running script, and cursive script. The regular script garden, which is neat and uses a lot of materials, will of course be more expensive. If it is simpler and made in the style of running script, it will be even more beautiful. Because the regular script is inevitably rigid, the running script is much more relaxed, and the cursive script is only sparsely decorated. The technology of layout is of course not easy, but the savings in price and the loveliness of the results can really make people never forget.

There is also one more thing, building a garden is not like building a house. Building a house is good to draw a design, and ask people to estimate the price, which is always similar. Building a garden is even simpler, there is no need to estimate the price. The same design can be built expensively or cheaply, very freely.

### A Corduroy Jacket Worth Advocating

— Yu Zhengyong

In the streets these days, we can often see many young men and women, especially a group of students from middle and high schools, wearing corduroy jackets (Coot) outside their suits, shirts, or short-sleeved cheongsams. Its style is a turn-down collar, cuffed sleeves, inserted pockets, and a zipper on the chest to replace buttons. This kind of jacket does indeed have the advantages of being beautiful, lightweight, and warm, without the stiffness of a suit jacket or the bulkiness of a coat. But the only drawback is that the price is too expensive, each piece costs about 30 yuan, and the refined ones cost even more. Moreover, these corduroy jackets are all imported! Because of these two reasons, although it still has three advantages, the author does not dare to advocate it! But recently, I saw a friend, Mr. Li Junlongzhang, wearing a jacket that was knitted with wool instead of corduroy, and I thought it was very popular and really worth introducing to the public.

His jacket knitted with wool still maintains the style of the original corduroy jacket, and is knitted very tightly with domestic coarse wool. In addition, buy a zipper as long as the clothes, and place it on the chest, replacing the buttons, which is more convenient to wear. For such a new garment, the greatest amount of money will be sent to foreigners' hands. Moreover, the knitting technique is familiar to mothers, wives, or sisters, so it can be said to be easy and everyone must be happy to imitate it, right? A picture is attached for reference.

### A One-Week Budget Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

This is really hard to say, pork was originally a basic meat dish in my menu, but now the city's butcher shops have completely closed down to uphold justice. Not only have people who like to eat meat suffered a great blow, but also this menu of mine is suffering from the inability to write. Well, if there is no fresh pork to eat, let's eat more salted pork and beef. As for vegetarian dishes, fortunately, fresh broad beans have gradually become delicious, which is a new force. The price is much cheaper than when it first came on the market. About four or five cents can buy a pound. A family of ten can use three or four pounds of beans for two meals, morning and evening. There are also newly listed water shields, which are also a delicious vegetarian dish. Although each pound costs about three cents, buying a few cents and putting it in yellow croaker soup can also be a great enjoyment. The method of making yellow croaker soup is to stew the yellow croaker until it is cooked and boned, and then braise the pure fish meat together with water shields, bamboo shoots, broad beans, fragrant mushrooms, etc., and add a little water chestnut powder. Although yellow croaker is an expensive item, two cents can buy a small one. Just keep your chopsticks in check and you can also taste the new flavor.

### On Vegetarian Food

— Sun Choucheng

It is really not easy to live in Shanghai. The high rent has been mentioned many times. Recently, because of the rice problem, hoarders deliberately accumulate and do not sell, causing the rice industry group to be unable to handle it and request assistance from the municipal chamber of commerce, which is already a headache. Unexpectedly, one wave has not subsided, and another wave has risen. The source of fresh pork has been robbed and cut off, resulting in the slaughterhouses in the two concessions implementing a slaughtering halt. The fresh meat industry has no goods to sell, so it has to be forced to close the market. Therefore, meat-eaters are panicked because there is no meat to eat. In fact, pork and rice have different properties. People in the south, regardless of size, must have rice every day to fill their stomachs. Pork is not a necessary item for every meal. Although it is rich in fat, it is obviously easy to make people fat, and hygienists dare not eat too much. Human life needs vitamins more than it needs fat. Vitamins are most abundant in vegetables. Usually, one should not only eat pork and not eat vegetables. It can be seen that pork is something that can be eaten but not necessarily must be eaten. According to this, even if the compatriots living in isolated islands, even if they do not know the taste of meat for three months like Confucius, it does not matter. If vegetables can be cooked properly, their taste can exceed that of fish and meat. The other day, business elders Chu Qiaqing and Yuan Lvdeng, in view of the new "Nine Flavors One" produced by Mr. Yao Junzhi's Standard Flavor Powder Factory, which can make vegetables delicious, specially wrote poems to promote it. One says that if this powder is used, clear soup can become eight treasures, and its flavor is better than chicken, duck, fish, and shrimp. The other admits that his wife used "Nine Flavors One" against seven qian three, which is extremely neat. The "seven qian three" refers to the weight of silver dollars. In the past, when coins were used, everyone knew it. Now that legal tender is used, the name "seven qian three" may not be mentioned for a long time. Now, the poems composed by Mr. Chu and Yuan are recorded below, which is also good news in promoting vegetables during the pork industry shutdown. (1) The mistress is virtuous and good at assisting the family, not supplying difficult ducks and fish and shrimp. But if nine flavors are used to season, vegetables and melons are even more delicious than meat. (2) The new daughter-in-law washes her hands and prepares soup, unfamiliar with the mother-in-law's nature and secretly hesitant. But if nine flavors are used to season, clear soup is turned into eight treasures. (The above two are seven-character quatrains, composed by Chu Qiaqing.) The seven matters open the door and carefully consult, hundreds of delicacies are high and difficult to taste. White jelly has the convenience of storing and changing surplus, and green vegetables can be filled in the basket without hindrance. Cooking only needs to add nine flavors one, and the expenditure is reduced by seven qian three. Its freshness is above fish and bear paws, and every meal is like my old indulgence. (The above is a seven-character heptasyllabic verse, composed by Yuan Lvdeng.)

### Random Talk on Bicycles

— Ting Yi

The Future of Bicycles　Bicycles are also called liberty cars. They are the only vehicles in modern times used for personal transportation and carrying light objects. They do not require the consumption of oil at ordinary times, and they are very cheap to buy, so the number of vehicles increases every year. I think when the national highway network is completed, the sales of bicycles will definitely increase sharply.

The Reason Why Bicycles are Faster Than Walking　When a person walks, when one foot extends and stands firm, when the other foot extends again, there will inevitably be bumps in the middle. Because of the bumps, it is easy to get tired, and the progress is slow. Moreover, the area of the foot is large, and the friction with the ground is also reduced a lot of forward speed. How about a bicycle? The friction between the wheel and the ground is small, the wheel keeps moving forward, and there are no bumps, so the forward movement of the bicycle is fast and labor-saving.

Reasons for Improving Bicycles　The bicycles currently in use are only suitable for traveling on smooth roads. If they are traveling on rough and uneven roads, and roads with a slope of twenty or thirty degrees, problems will occur. Without improvement, that is an obstacle to the future of bicycles.

Methods of Improvement　(1) Add hand cranks to the "handlebar" to increase the car's forward force. (2) In the middle of the car, install a wing on each side, using the resistance of the air to reduce the friction with the ground and the burden on the wheels, to increase the speed of the car. (3) The person on the bicycle should wear a streamlined thing on his chest to reduce the air resistance in front.

### The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of Albanians

— Ying Dai

Albania was annexed by Italy in a very short time, symbolizing that in this world, small and weak countries without strength are full of terror and crisis, and may be destroyed at any time. Here, let's put politics aside and talk about the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of Albanians.

Clothing　Albania is the smallest country in the Balkan Peninsula, but Albanians are a very ancient people. Even now, the ancient style can still be seen from the clothing of Albanians. They wear white lantern pants and white shirts, Turkish-style hats on their heads, and raw leather shoes on their feet. Some have fur decorations in front of their chests. The "Scanderbeg costume" commemorates Scanderbeg, the hero who defeated the Turks in the fifteenth century. Most of women's clothes are black, and each has a metal wide belt to tie the chest strap, and there are extremely long red ropes that wrap from the buttocks straight to the chest, which is very strange. The clothes of the newly married bride are even more peculiar. On the day of the wedding, several strings of gold coins will be hung on the chest as decorations.

Food　Albania is a backward agricultural country, but the agricultural products produced are sufficient for self-sufficiency, and among the agricultural products, the corn produced accounts for the largest number. Therefore, the bread eaten in farmers' homes is also made of corn. This kind of bread is made by farm women themselves. A wooden wheel water mill is installed next to the mountain stream to grind their corn into flour, and then made into pieces of bread. After the bread is kneaded, it is covered with an iron plate piled with ash, and then taken to the stove to bake. Albanians who believe in Catholicism, on the day of the Holy Protection Memorial, after doing mass, the Catholics are accustomed to gather for a lamb meal. The lamb is roasted whole on a long stick, and it can be eaten up in a moment.

Housing　Albania is a country of mountains. The whole country has more mountains than plains, so many tribes live in deep mountains and wild valleys. Simple houses made of wooden boards are tile houses, and the construction is also very rough. The windows and doors are all made of wooden boards. In cities, single-story houses are the majority. Although there are buildings on the lively streets, they are only two stories high, and the structure is obviously simple and crude. It is rare to see a new-style building.

Transportation　Albania's transportation is also quite inconvenient. Because the whole country is mountainous, undulating, and very small in area, less than a province in China, so until now, there is not a road. However, in recent years, with economic assistance from Italy, many new highways have been built, and the number of cars is increasing day by day. Albanian women sometimes carry buckets to fetch water from distant rivers in the mountains and fields, all by walking. In some places, the boats used to ferry across the river are made of sheepskin or dug holes in tree trunks. The backwardness of transportation can be imagined from this.

### Hongwen Academy

(See the May issue of this newspaper in the eleventh year of Tongzhi of the Defunct Qing Dynasty)

British Consul Mr. Mai initiated the opening of Hongwen Academy to house Chinese people and learn about the struggles of Western studies. All Western books translated into Chinese are kept in the academy, and machines are also provided. Western scholars specializing in natural history are invited to lecture on Western studies in the academy. Chinese new newspapers and famous Chinese books are also prepared. The required capital is estimated at 1,500 taels of silver, which is raised by Chinese and foreign merchants. Anyone who enters the academy pays half a yuan per month to cover monthly expenses. Although this project was initiated by a Westerner, it is actually set up for the Chinese, so Westerners do not study in it. The names of Chinese scholars registered are initially limited to 100. Afterwards, those who wish to enter the academy must be recommended by two of the initial entrants before they can be registered.

### Zongli Yamen Employs British Assistant

The Englishman McGibbon Brown previously planned to build a railway from Tianjin to Beijing, which has been approved by China. Brown then returned to London to purchase machinery for use. It is now heard that this project will not proceed. It is also heard that the Chinese Zongli Yamen plans to promote Brown to the position of official to assist in handling foreign affairs. Brown plans to take office soon.

### Rabbit Prices

In Shanghai, the price of a pair of rabbits is usually only worth 500-600 cash. It is recently heard that there are merchants who profit from selling them to Japan, which has led to a sudden increase in their price. It is heard that the Japanese have never valued this animal much. Recently, the empress dowager of that country suffered from a prolonged illness, and medical treatment was ineffective. A subordinate offered a pair of rabbits, which the empress dowager placed around her to play with. The rabbits were also docile and lovable, which helped to soothe her emotions and dispel her long-standing illness, a credit to the imperial hospital. As a result, they mutually praised the white rabbits produced in China as being the best for nursing the sick. Therefore, wealthy families all bought and raised them, and the price of rabbits rose. Now that the number of vendors has increased, the price has slightly decreased. The initial profit was very high.

### Advice to Literary Youths with Old Hobbies

— Shang Qing

Someone said long ago that although China is inferior to others in science in the modern world, resulting in material civilization lagging behind, its philosophy and literature have unique strengths that make spiritual civilization surpass all countries in the world. Therefore, general scholars of national essence hold on to many thread-bound fragments and incomplete chapters for dear life, refusing to let go, thinking of them as secret treasures in their pillows, appreciating them, studying them, and creating them endlessly. They also desperately promote them, calling on younger generations to follow their path, for everyone to appreciate, study, and create. Most middle school Chinese language teachers are inevitably like this, and almost all university Chinese language professors are like this. Let's think carefully, is this really right?

Whether our philosophy and literature surpass all countries in the world is too big of a question to discuss now. Even if our philosophy and literature have unique strengths, should all reading youths appreciate, study, and create them? I think anyone who knows what a country, especially our current country, needs, would not say they should. Of course, young people with special talents and hobbies for this kind of philosophy and literature may appreciate, study, and create them, but it is definitely not something that everyone should do.

Now, let's not talk about philosophy yet, let's talk about literature. I have seen many literary youths with this hobby. They like to write classical Chinese, and the more incomprehensible it is, the more they want to write it. Their purpose is not to learn, but to show off and show that they are knowledgeable. Once they can write fluently, they still write regardless of time, place, and need. They like to compose poetry, seven-character and five-character verses, oblique and level tones, without asking whether the composition is good or not, just claiming to be elegant. They also like to drop literary allusions verbally, however, therefore, and so on, regardless of whether it is appropriate or not, always inserting a few in every sentence to show that they are local literati. Even worse, they still cannot escape the idea of talented scholars and beautiful women, writing love letters and romance novels full of flowery words and erotic poetry. They embrace a cat-tiger doctrine in school, take a perfunctory attitude in society, and live at home by not engaging in family production, self-proclaimed noble. Anyone who says he shouldn't be like this will be glared at and dismissed as a vulgar person. If he has family property, he will definitely squander it. If he originally had no family property, he will definitely end up in dire straits. However, he does not regret it, nor does he change, and he will still use "a gentleman is steadfast in poverty" and "poets become more skilled in poverty" to excuse himself. …

I feel really heartbroken when I see such youths, so I want to tell them a few words with my sincere wishes:

In this era, especially in China now, it is best not to have a hobby for literature, because literature is not the most urgent need, especially not to have a hobby for old literature, because what is in old literature is mostly: discouraging words; decadent words; fantasies; illusions; bored extreme thoughts; affectation; pointless moaning; …. This is opium, alcohol, any harmful anesthetic.

If you already know the harm of this old literature, but cannot quit it for a while, then I advise you to just appreciate it. When you have free time, use it as a pastime and appreciate it, but do not go further and engage in research. If you have the spirit of research, I hope you will study subjects that are actually useful to the modern world, especially to our country, and not study this old literature.

Taking a step back, if you not only have a definite hobby for this old literature, but also have definite talent for it, and you must engage in research, then go and research it. It would not be bad to research a clue and some practical results, but you must not engage in creation. Because even if the creation is like the original, it is just a fake antique. If it is not like the original, it is even more of a joke. And nine times out of ten, the creation is not like the original, so why bother to do something that is laborious and fruitless?

As a final step, if you are already good at creating this old literature, I still advise you to create as little as possible. This kind of thing is fundamentally useless, it is really only good for covering jars, and it is inevitable that it will give people a bad influence. You should not show the kind of old-fashioned literati airs that are often seen in old-style literati just because you are good at creating this kind of thing. Scholars were scolded by prostitutes in the past as being worth a few cents a pound. Now, I'm afraid they are not only worthless, but people will hold their noses and walk away when they see your sour attitude! If you have a firm grasp of writing techniques, it is better to write more new-style creations that fit the times.

What I am saying is indeed a buzzkill, and someone may be scolding me for not understanding old literature and therefore having such a superficial view to insult old literature. I will not defend myself, I am willing to accept such scolding. However, what I am really worried about, I have to say. I don't want to see good youths get on the wrong train and go back decades or hundreds of years, wasting their lives and ruining the country's affairs. I hope that everyone can walk on the modern avenue!

At the same time, I also hope that most middle school Chinese language teachers and almost all university Chinese language professors will not over-promote this old literature, and will be able to clearly distinguish appreciation, research, and creation. Even if there is promotion, it should be for the purpose of being practical for oneself and the country.

### The Tricks of the Aggressor

### Returning Home (Part 1)

— Wang Li

Having bid farewell to my beloved comrades and brothers, I changed into plain clothes and, with an excited heart, set out on the road from the guerrilla zone to the occupied territory.

Carrying a small bundle on my back, I walked silently through the rural fields. Ahead of me, the morning sun cast a dazzling light.

Beyond the distant horizon where the sun rose—lay my fallen hometown! In the occupied hometown were my father and younger brother. I strained my eyes to look at the horizon, and a heart that had long been in pain felt as if it were tightly gripped by a powerful giant hand. My pace quickened on the road, which was still damp with night dew.

Hometown! Father! Brother!

In the blink of an eye, I had been separated from them for over a year! During this year of separation, we had lost all contact.

—In this year, was the occupied hometown unharmed? In this year, how had Father and Brother been living?

This longing, which had long been in my heart, was now urgently aroused again.

Confused thoughts dominated my mind. My legs moved as if someone else were directing them. A pebble tripped my foot, finally shaking me awake.

I turned back to look at my comrades, brothers, and the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland behind me, and a boundless feeling of farewell arose. I looked again at the three peaks of Maoshan against the blue sky, with thin, light clouds floating at the top.

—Maoshan! Farewell! Farewell! Maoshan—I muttered to myself, nodding silently to it.

Then I faced the dazzling sun again, and strode forward.

…

At dusk, I arrived at a village. I stopped my tired feet at a farmer's house and stayed for the night.

In the morning, I picked up my small bundle and continued my journey. But when I reached about a third of a mile from the main road, I suddenly heard several gunshots ahead, and I had to stop. Then, the sounds of rifles and machine guns continued to ring out.

—Are they attacking a car? …Are the "yellow shirts" coming to the countryside?…

I pondered.

On the road ahead, farmers were fleeing this way in twos and threes. I went up to a mound and looked ahead. Behind a line of trees, black smoke suddenly rose. Then, black smoke rose from one place after another.

I asked the farmers who were approaching in a panic and learned that the "yellow soldiers" were repairing the destroyed bridge, venting their inherent arrogance.

I retreated to a small village I had just passed through, and only bypassed the road at dusk by taking a detour.

The next day, I walked along with an ordinary person. Along the way, we talked like familiar friends. Every time we came across a teahouse, we would rest, drink a few bowls of tea, or drink a little white liquor. (He was a friend who loved to drink.)

As we walked down a loess slope and passed the Huangshan Temple, we heard loud and dense artillery fire from behind us, probably from the direction of Xipu.

I don't know why, but over the years, I had developed a love for the sound of guns and cannons, like the sound of bugles stirring in the morning air.

Hearing the sound of artillery, my steps became more energetic. Every particularly loud cannon blast gave me an indescribable feeling of pleasure.

Along the way, the common people were filled with fear and joy, joy and fear, talking to each other in bewilderment, or standing blankly, looking towards the distant place where the cannon fire was ringing out.

As the sun was about to set, I parted ways with the ordinary person I was traveling with and went to a small town.

A friendly army unit was stationed in the town. When I passed the bridge, the sentry standing on the bridge looked at my documents again and again, questioned me very carefully, and then let me pass. The houses in the town were all filled with friendly troops. I searched for a long time and finally found lodging in a teahouse. I spent the night sleeping with two tea tables put together.

### Abandonment and Seeking

— Qian Changnian

I tried to dispel all memories, but they were like a swarm of nasty flies, flying back at once, buzzing in my ears.

Gently pushing open the door of my heart, inside, lay my old memories.

My silent heart was like a white sailboat sailing on the downstream of memories, carrying me to distant places:

The past events that once brought tears to my eyes could no longer evoke my sadness; the old stories that once made me happy could no longer make me laugh.

Having abandoned everything of the past, my heart began to feel empty again.

Everything of the past should be abandoned. I will take my heart to the distant places where no footsteps have yet reached, seeking what can fill the emptiness in my heart.

### Shi Dakai's True Poem

— Luo Yi

In the "Free Talk" section of the May 11th issue, Mr. Zou Xiao's article "Shi Dakai's Poem" mentioned my humble compilation of "Poems and Writings of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," so I will also say a few words about it.

That Shi Dakai, the Wing King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, was capable of writing poetry and prose is, of course, a fact. However, most of the works that have been passed down, eight or nine out of ten, are fake. The "Poems and Writings of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" includes about five or six of his articles. Strictly speaking, only the official certificate issued to the favored Prime Minister Yang Fuguang is truly authentic. However, this certificate was probably written by a member of his staff and cannot be considered Shi Dakai's own work. Even the one or two essays copied from the "Compilation of Bandit Affairs" are undoubtedly authentic, but at the same time, they are also the work of his staff. As for the several proclamations, after examining them according to the rules and customs of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, it can be determined that they are works forged by later generations. Even those famous lines, such as "Cannot bear to see the attire of the superior nation changed to that of barbarians; Let us lead the heroes of the Central Plains to reclaim our rivers and mountains," though stirring and passionate, even Mr. Liang Qichao was deceived by them and praised them. In fact, they are still forgeries by later generations and not the personal works of the Wing King Shi.

As for Shi Dakai's poems, from Gao Tianmei's "Collection of Shi Dakai's Poems" to Lu Jiye's "Collection of Shi Dakai's Poems," up to my own "Poems and Writings," although there are some differences in what has been collected, a letter written to me by Mr. Liu Yazi proves that they all originated from forgeries by Mr. Gao Tianmei. (Even those famous two lines, "My ambition is not fulfilled, and people are already suffering; Everywhere in the southeast are traces of tears," were also forged.) This is the strongest evidence. From this, it can be said that all the poems of Shi Dakai that we have seen in the past are forgeries by later generations, and none of them are real. (As for Xu Zhiyan's embellished "Diary of Shi Dakai," it is entirely the language of a novelist and not credible, as scholars have long recognized and need not be elaborated on.) Having said that, does it mean that Shi Dakai, who could write poetry, did not leave behind a single poem? Not entirely so. Shi Dakai did have a true poem, which is still inscribed in large characters on the stone wall of the Bailong Cave in Yishan County, Guangxi Province. This poem was written by Shi Dakai when he visited Bailong Cave before entering Sichuan. In front of it is Shi's preface, along with a five-character poem he wrote, and behind it are ten poems by his staff, such as Zhang Suimou, and a poem by Zhang Yunqing from Hunan. In addition to these poems, there is also a seven-character ancient-style poem by Jiang You Li Langu, Minister of the Household Department of the Wing Palace, titled "Visiting Bailong Cave in the Late Autumn of Jiwei, Recalling the Past." All of the above poems were carefully copied and sent to me by Mr. Chen Qingyu, the county magistrate of Yishan, in June of the 26th year of the Republic of China. Although there are transcriptions circulating outside, there are many errors. What I rely on is the original stone inscription, which is, of course, reliable. Unfortunately, the fourth edition of "Poems and Writings" after the national crisis has already been printed and cannot be included, so it can only be compiled into the sequel to "Poems and Writings." At the same time, I am currently writing a biography of the figures in the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, based on these stone inscriptions, and have written an article on Shi Dakai's staff. Now, I will copy Shi Dakai's preface and poem below for everyone to admire the true work of a national hero.

The preface reads: "In the tenth year of Gengshen of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the army was stationed in Qingyuan. In the late spring, during a break from official duties, I, along with several high-ranking officials, inspected the fragrant suburbs. The mountains and rivers competed in beauty, and the grasses and trees vied for splendor. Ascending this ancient cave, poems were arranged like jade ornaments, and rhymes were written with elegance. I then saw the lines of Liu Yunqing on the white wall, which were exceptionally sublime and expressed with heroic words, containing a denouncement of Buddhism and the expulsion of evil. I greatly appreciated it and ordered that his poem be carved in stone as a warning to those who are deluded by immortals and Buddhas. I and my officials also composed several chapters in the original rhyme, all of which were carved in stone to commemorate the visit." The poem reads: "Standing tall on the towering peaks, Gazing afar, my eyes light up the empty space. Destroying Buddhas and honoring the Heavenly Emperor, Resettling the people and restoring the ancient ways. Leading the army, I am called a brave general, Exploring the cave, I envy the poetic hero. The sword's aura rushes to the stars, The light of literature shines like a rainbow." (Proceeds from Sales Donated)

### Success of American Television Films

You Can Watch Movies at Home This Summer Without Going Out / The Price is High, So It May Not Be Common for Now

Following sound films, another revolution in film history is undoubtedly television. According to the latest news we have received, American television films will move from theory to reality. Here, we will write down the news from America:

(1) The Year of Commencement

1939 in the United States will be the year that television films truly begin. Special attention is paid to the words "begin." Radio broadcasting began in 1920, but commercial radios only began to be installed in 1922, and the sound was not very good until 1924. In 1926, radio began to be mass-produced and radio networks were formed. Therefore, in fact, radio only became truly popular at this time. After several improvements, television films will begin this year, and the first step—regarding technical, planning, and economic issues—will be decided this year. By summer, they will be able to install television films in their homes.

(2) Outline of the Structure

So, what will we see after this kind of television film becomes popular in the future? How much will it cost to buy a television film machine? Let's talk about the situation of television films first. In the United States, the two major radio companies, National and Columbia, will indeed broadcast television films this year. They use the Cathode Ray System, which is based on a tube called a cathode ray tube. The sound emitted is very simple, the main purpose is to make people watch. But behind it, the configuration of electricity is very complicated. For example, in the engineering field, countless people have spent their efforts, researching and improving it repeatedly, to have what we have today. There is also a strong interest in briefly describing this method here. In the cathode ray tube, there is a kind of electronic light, which is completely inert, forming a starlight point, which is shot at the end of the tube. This light point will continue to change the light and shadow, shaking back and forth very quickly, while shaking up and down is very slow. After these two actions are integrated, the light point for controlling the image can be created. We have seen that in the early days, researchers of television films all determined that large projectors could emit 441 lines of film based on mechanical aspects, and the current line number is also based on this number as a standard. Later, after the cathode ray tube was invented, moving at high speed can be more successful than low-speed, non-amplified styles, without increasing the sound, and without increasing the cost of the machine. (To be continued)

### Matters Concerning Female Actors

Dong Mingyan, since the New New Company's amusement park stopped its reorganization, her brother-in-law Zhang Suting's Da Jing troupe has also announced its dissolution. She was the mainstay of this troupe, and many parties have come to invite her. Now, the Gong Wu Stage is in contact with her again, and there is a high hope of success.

Wang Lan, since returning to China from Saigon, Annam, has developed a strong interest in Peking Opera. She used to learn opera from Lao Ling Gong Chen Xiangyun, so she practices her voice very diligently every day. According to what she told me, in a few days, she will ask Teacher Chen to arrange a guest performance for her, preparing to perform a few days in June. Now she knows more than ten operas such as "Interrogation of the Head," "Stabbing Tang," "The Lotus Lantern," and "June Snow."

Jin Mudan feels very happy since her sisters returned to Shanghai from Luzon. Recently, she made a large number of costumes, preparing to wear them when she forms her own troupe.

Chen Jianying is the second daughter of Chen Yuelou, the backstage manager of Gong Wu Stage. The day before yesterday, she was introduced by Wang Fusheng and became a disciple of the famous Dan Jin Biyan, holding a ceremony at home and hosting a teacher-apprentice banquet.

After Wang Yanqiu and Wang Juchen got married, they still perform at the Da Wu Stage. The night before last, after the opera, she went to the backstage of the Da Jing troupe at the Sincere Amusement Park for the first time to pick up her husband home.

Fu Juying is recognized as a good child backstage at the Da Wu Stage. Recently, she studied under Yan Yuru. Her appearance, posture, singing, and acting are all good, and she has the potential to become a star.

The Three Musketeers (Li Zi's three brothers) swore to the sky: "We will work together to deal with the aggressors who are destroying world justice, peace, and freedom!"

### Wang Lan Returns to Shanghai from Saigon / Chen Juanjuan is Trapped in Bia, Siam

New film star Wang Lan and her mother Wang Yuling were invited by the China Art Group (now renamed China Da Jing Troupe) to perform in Saigon, Annam last winter. They returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday, accompanied by two drama comrades, Fang Manying and Liu Xiasheng. That night, I met her backstage at the Liaoyou Drama Club and felt that her demeanor was still as plump and naive as before, without much change. We had a five-minute conversation. According to what she told me: "The business at the China Grand Theater in Saigon was very bad at the beginning, but later it gradually turned around. However, the treatment of the performers was very poor, so she and the four of them took the Sichuan wheel back to China first, and the rest stayed there to perform. Old operas such as Diao Chan are very popular. There were ten days of travel on the way back. In Shantou, because of unloading goods, it was docked for two days. It happened that Japanese planes were frantically bombing the area, and they were greatly frightened, but they finally returned to Shanghai safely." I asked her what her plans were for the future. She said: "I am not very interested in movies and dramas, but I have a considerable love for Peking Opera, and I plan to embark on this path in the future." Finally, she also reported to me an unfortunate news, that the child star Chen Juanjuan is now trapped in Bia, which is located at the border of Annam and Siam, because some people in her group have completed the entry procedures, and some have not, so they are in a dilemma and have become a stalemate.

Wang Lan's father is Wang Daigong, the director of the Lianyou Society. Since his wife and daughter went abroad, he has been thinking about them every day. Moreover, the lack of news made his mood worse. The day before yesterday, at six o'clock in the morning, his daughter woke him up at the bedside, and he was so happy that he jumped up and didn't want to sleep anymore. From now on, this humorous comedian will perform even more vividly on stage. (Proceeds from Sales Donated)

### Idle Talk on "Book Opera"

The name "book opera" is actually fundamentally untenable, because books are books, and operas are operas, how can they be related? However, the storytellers of the Guangyu and Runyu Societies always like to bring out this fresh thing called "book opera" whenever they have the "Special Grand Assembly Book" at the end of the year or hold other fundraising activities, and sell its "savage head" to attract people. For example, last year's "book opera" at Da Luotian for three days was sold out every day, and the seat price was as high as one yuan or more.

The so-called "book opera," to put it bluntly, is nothing more than translated lyrics with makeup performances. The props and scenes are indeed the same as civilized opera and Tan Huang opera, and there is not much difference in the movements such as dialogue and expression; but the singing still retains the full emphasis of the storytelling.

Because this "book opera" is newly born from storytelling, the structure of all the skills and various conditions in other theaters have not yet been nurtured to a considerable degree of maturity, and cannot independently form a department. It always depends on storytelling, and is invisibly like a tail of storytelling; at the same time, there are no artists who specialize in singing "book opera." Whenever "book opera" is held, it is usually "guest starred" by storytellers.

However, the results of several past "book opera" performances have been very good, which shows that there must be a part of the audience in the society who are enthusiastically welcoming it. If "book opera" is improved several times, I think this tail may have the possibility of completing its independence.

In addition, the emergence of "book opera" is also greatly influenced by Southern Opera. Southern Opera, initially named Southern Opera, was first performed by Wang Siquan and other unemployed members of the Guangyu Society at the Great World, and the performance was the simplest way to make up and perform the storytelling. Later, from Southern Opera, it became Southern Opera, and then to today's Suzhou Wuxi, the name has changed several times, and the form has also been replaced, and it has gradually separated from storytelling; and the original home is undoubtedly still in storytelling. Therefore, it is not impossible to say that Southern Opera is the predecessor of "book opera."

### Amateur Drama Public Performance

The Shanghai Drama Art Society is scheduled to hold its ninth experimental public performance at the New Light Grand Theater at 10:00 a.m. on May 21. It is said that the participants in this performance are the Shanghai Amateur Drama Association. The plays include (1) the Shanghai Drama Society's collective creation "The Tears of a Dancing Girl," (2) Zhang Min's creation "A Small Scene on a Snowy Night," and (3) Gorky's original work adapted by Tian Han, "Mother." Pre-sale tickets are on sale from today.

Two Things About the Righteous Actor Luo Kuifang That Are Worth Mentioning Before His Death

His playfulness only valued insiders. Years ago, the level of Shanghai people watching operas was tens of times worse than it is now. Yu Shuyan did not receive a warm welcome when he came to Shanghai twice, let alone him. One year, before and after Gao Qingkui and Ma Daliang appeared on stage in Shanghai during the New Year, they both went to the Jiuji Opera Club to pay their respects. It happened that Xiao Bao was also there. After the meal, everyone sang two sections to play around. Gao and Ma were both leading actors at that time, and they naturally looked down on Luo Kuifang, who was down and out in Shanghai. Who knew that after the three of them sang a section each, the strengths and weaknesses were immediately judged. In terms of tune, taste, and the words in his mouth, Xiao Bao was better than Da Zaban (Gao's nickname) and Da She Tou (Ma's nickname) in everything. Most of the people who listened to the opera at that time were insiders, and they all said that it would be best for big actors like Gao and Ma, who earned tens of thousands of silver, to ask Mr. Luo, who earned less than a thousand yuan a month, for advice, so that they could truly obtain the essence of the Tan School. Another time, I was invited by my old friend Yu Yunshan to invite Chen Yanheng, Luo Xiaobao, etc. to sing and play at his mansion. It happened that Yang Baozhong also came to Xu's house to pay his respects. The accompanying Qin master he brought was Chen Hongshou (Songnian). Baozhong was only over twenty years old. The so-called "newborn calf is not afraid of tigers," he claimed to be the pillar of the Danggui First Stage, so how could he take Xiao Bao seriously? At first, he simply ignored Xiao Bao. Later, everyone asked Yanheng to play the Qin for Xiao Bao and sing a section of "Sitting in the Palace." One was a master of the erhu, and the other was an authentic Tan School beard student. Singing the slow board in the key above "Zheng Gong" was truly very flavorful. In the past, Xiao Bao could not find a good Qin master (in fact, he could not afford one), and many good tunes could not be used. Chen Twelfth Master had never met a good singer, so he was just casually playing along. Today, the forces were evenly matched, and they met each other, truly showing their strengths to the fullest, so good that it could not be better. After Xiao Bao finished singing this long section, he did not feel tired at all, and he also humbly asked Yanheng for corrections. Yanheng never easily praised people, but unexpectedly, he praised Kuifang very much that day. (14)

This time, I proposed the "Three Horses in the Same Stable" challenge, and I received many responses from all walks of life. I received more than 600 letters of response, of which 72 people correctly guessed the solution, and more than 80 people partially guessed the solution. The first five people who correctly guessed the solution will be separately rewarded with a copy of "Memoirs of the Battle of Shanghai," which will be reviewed and increased by Shen Bao. The remaining gentlemen who correctly guessed the solution are limited by the regulations, and I apologize for not sending gifts. I hope you will forgive me. - Lian Xuezheng
