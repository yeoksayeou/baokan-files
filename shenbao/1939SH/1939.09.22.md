### Germany and Soviet Union Divide Poland: Soviet Union Occupies Oil-Producing Center, Soviet Army Establishes Soviets in Occupied Areas, Four German Officers Fly to Moscow to Discuss Military Affairs

Kovno: It is reported that Lviv, an important industrial city in southeastern Poland and a center for oil production, which both Germany and the Soviet Union sought to occupy, has now been assigned to the Soviet Union by a joint German-Soviet boundary commission. Other notable centers assigned to the Soviet Union include Vilnius, Grodno, Pinsk, and Brest-Litovsk. (Reuter, 21st)

Zurich, Switzerland: A Zurich report has published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that, according to German official sources, German troops within Poland have reached a line from Sovami (north) to Stori (south), which has been recognized by the Soviet government. (Havas, 21st)

London: According to reliable sources in Berlin, negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union regarding the division of occupied territories in Poland are still ongoing in Berlin, and a satisfactory resolution is far from reached. Furthermore, if the Romanian government allows key figures of the Polish government who have fled to Romania to pass onward, Germany intends to protest to Romania. (Havas, 21st)

Capital of Switzerland: The German Labor Newspaper recently reported that German troops on the eastern front in Poland have reached the boundary agreed upon by the German and Soviet governments. The newspaper did not specify whether this boundary was agreed upon by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop during his previous visit to Moscow or whether it is based on the territory already occupied by Soviet troops. German officials have not made any statements regarding this matter, only stating that the German-Soviet boundary was defined by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1917. Well-informed sources here say that Soviet troops have already crossed this line by a considerable distance. (Havas, 21st)

Cernăuți: According to information obtained here, the Red Army's forces entering Poland number 110 divisions, and they are currently organizing a Soviet government, using Ukrainian farmers as local committees and secretariats. The Polish border has been closed. Czerlejczyki held a meeting to establish border regions but reached no decision. Several thousand Soviet troops are stationed in Czerlejczyki. (Reuter, 21st)

Cernăuți, Romanian Border: Local administrative committees have been established in the areas of Poland occupied by the Soviet army. (Reuter, 20th)

Moscow: Four German military officers arrived here yesterday from East Prussia by plane to discuss with the Soviet General Staff various technical issues related to the interaction between German and Soviet troops in Poland. In addition, the German government recently dispatched Army Colonel Eggert to Moscow to assist General Köstring, the military attaché at the German embassy in the Soviet Union. (Havas, 20th)

Berlin: According to the German official news agency, German troops met with advancing Soviet troops today. (Reuter, 21st)

Cernăuți, Romania: According to reliable sources, Soviet troops advancing into southern Poland reached the border town of Krynica (at the border between Poland and Hungary) last night, which originally belonged to the Carpathian Ruthenia province of Czechoslovakia. (Havas, 21st)

Capital of Romania: Since the Soviet Red Army completely occupied the Polish border area adjacent to Romania, the general impression here is that Germany has allowed a certain force to penetrate Central Europe, which it cannot control and which is detrimental to its interests. German semi-official sources had previously expressed that it would be beneficial if Germany were directly connected to Romanian territory. This hope has now vanished. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has come into contact with the Carpathian Ukrainians in Hungary, and even the Slovak State and the German protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia are feeling the influence of the Soviet Union. Recently, residents in these areas have rebelled, which will undoubtedly be encouraged by the Soviet Union and suppressed severely by the German political police, further strengthening their determination to break away from German rule. (Havas, 21st)

Cernăuți, Romania: After Soviet troops occupied the area bordering Poland and Romania, the military commanders of both sides had some contact. Then, they separately closed the border. A Havas correspondent who wanted to cross the border in Czerlejczyki (southern Poland) was stopped. Soviet representatives will discuss the opening of the border in the Romanian capital. Wherever Soviet troops arrived, they replaced Polish officials and formed Soviets, appointing Ukrainian and Little Russian peasants as committee members. Furthermore, the Romanian government recently issued a communique here, stating that Polish military and political personnel, as well as refugees with valid passports, are allowed to leave Romania by train or road. (Havas, 21st)

Paris: Polish troops continued to resist German and Soviet forces in three locations yesterday, but neutral military observers believe that large-scale warfare will soon end. Polish troops are still holding Warsaw, Łódź, and Lublin. Only seventeen Polish divisions are fighting in these areas. German and Soviet troops have met at the border previously agreed upon by both parties. This line is similar to the one that former U.S. President Wilson attempted to recognize in the Treaty of Versailles. According to neutral sources, German troops withdrew from Białystok and Brest-Litovsk yesterday, allowing Soviet troops to occupy them. German and Soviet radio stations announced that the Red Army has occupied Lviv, a city that German forces had besieged for ten days without success. (Associated Press, 21st)

Moscow: Four German army and air force officers arrived here yesterday by plane to discuss the Polish issue with Soviet authorities. None of them hold a rank higher than colonel. It is reported that the Red Army has penetrated 125 miles into Poland, with its front line stretching from Lithuania in the north, through Lviv in the middle, to the Romanian border in the south, and continuing to advance. According to last night's Soviet official report, Russian cavalry and armored units have reached the outskirts of Lviv. It also stated that yesterday, the Red Army engaged in a fierce battle with Polish troops for two hours before entering Vilnius. In addition, the Red Army also occupied many towns and cities. (Associated Press, 21st)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that London is now watching the Soviet Union's reaction to Hitler's speech and whether a German-Soviet agreement on the status and borders of Poland can be established soon. Regarding Hitler's speech, the German-Soviet non-aggression pact does not seem to have any provisions for the collapse of Poland, but it largely recognizes the Soviet Union's claims to Belarus and part of Ukraine. However, Galicia and Lviv are likely not within the scope of this agreement. It is heard that German newspapers are visibly uneasy seeing the Soviet Union's general mobilization and its rapid advance along the Romanian border, intending to cut off the German route to the Balkans. At the same time, Hitler's speech did not reveal any German plans for the future of Poland. If a buffer state is established, Hitler will demand that the Soviet Union cede the Galician territories and incorporate them into Germany. Hitler will also try his best to avoid a common German-Soviet border, but it is said that the Soviet Union does not entirely agree with this. In summary, Hitler has at least abandoned his old attempt to invade Ukraine. The Soviet Union's diplomatic activities in the Balkans are particularly significant. The Turkish Foreign Minister is now travelling to Moscow to expand the Turkish-Soviet pact guaranteeing the inviolability of the Black Sea, and Soviet missions are also visiting Yugoslavia and Romania. There is much talk that Yugoslavia will sign a five-year non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. All these actions cannot be ignored by Germany. Hungary is also very disturbed to see the Soviet Union become its neighbor. However, the Gentlemen's Agreement between Greece and Italy, which stipulates the withdrawal of troops from the Albanian border, may stabilize the situation in Southeastern Europe. (Reuter, 21st)

### British and French Naval and Army Commanders Discuss Military Matters, British Troops Continuously Enter France, French and German Air Forces Clash Several Times

Paris: Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier received British War Minister Hore-Belisha today and immediately convened a meeting with General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of National Defense; Vice Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy; General Colson, Chief of Staff of the Army; Trippe, Director of Diplomacy; and Kulund, Diplomatic Secretary of the Premier's Office. The details of the meeting are being kept strictly confidential by the government, but political figures generally feel a good impression and comment that Hitler's speech in Danzig yesterday, intended to alienate Britain and France, is best answered by today's meeting. The fact that Poland was defeated after hard fighting was originally expected by Britain and France. If the Soviet Union had not intervened, the Polish army could have held out for a longer time. How Germany will act after this is still undecided by Führer Hitler. Generally, if Germany adopts a defensive posture on the Western Front and advances towards the Balkans in the East, it will inevitably lead to entanglement with the Soviet Union. Conversely, if German troops launch an offensive on the Western Front, the Allied forces of Britain and France will stand ready and will not allow Germany to achieve its goals. Even if Germany attempts to violate Belgian neutrality to bypass the French Maginot Line or seeks to establish submarine bases in the Netherlands, Britain and France are well prepared, and Belgium and the Netherlands will defend themselves with all their strength. (Havas, 20th)

Paris: British troops continue to enter France. Although the number cannot be disclosed, it is known that as a result of the joint efforts of the British and French navies and air forces, British troops are moving into France along a safe route that is guaranteed to be free from any attacks. The existence of this route also improves ordinary sea and air traffic between Britain and France. There is no news of major military activities here. It is reported that the French authorities are very pleased with the physical condition and training of the British troops and their suitability for the new war situation. (Reuter, 21st)

Paris: A communiqué from the French military headquarters stated that French and German fighter planes clashed several times in the skies over the Western Front yesterday. A German plane was shot down behind the French lines. The communiqué also stated that enemy artillery units were active at various points on the front. (Reuter, 21st)

Paris: Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier is scheduled to deliver a nationwide broadcast address at 8:30 PM tonight to report on the current situation. (Havas, 21st)

Paris: General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 35, stating, "There was only local activity by forward units. Artillery units of both sides engaged in heavy shelling." (Havas, 21st)

Berlin: General von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, arrived on the German Western Front yesterday to inspect several defense lines and discuss matters with local garrison staff. He then drove through the Saar region, where he was warmly welcomed by the people. (Haitong, 20th)

Paris: General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 34, stating, "German artillery was very active at various points along the front. French and German fighter planes engaged in several air battles. A German aircraft was shot down in our lines." (Havas, 20th)

London: According to French sources, German artillery fire is not particularly remarkable. Although their aircraft are performing well, French aircraft can easily handle them. This is a period of tactical waiting. The French army is currently clearing the areas it has captured. The Want forest is full of landmines and traps. Seemingly harmless fences and other objects will explode upon slight contact. This is not only the case in the forest but also elsewhere. Therefore, the French army must conduct clearing operations in every area it occupies. According to French reports, Germany has assembled 1,500 aircraft behind the town of Aachen and has many workers rapidly strengthening the Siegfried Line along the Luxembourg border. Naval writers generally believe that Hitler had no more than fifty submarines capable of operating in the ocean at the start of the war. The number that have been sunk, as reported by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons, already accounts for a considerable proportion, and the losses of British ships are decreasing. The French also believe they have destroyed at least five German submarines. People generally speculate that Germany's future actions will involve using faster ships to attack British ships that are more strongly escorted than British convoy escorts. (Reuter, 21st)

### Red Army War Report: Over 60,000 Polish Officers and Soldiers Captured

Moscow: The General Staff of the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army released the following war report for September 20th: On September 20th, Red Army units continued to press the Polish army, occupying the following locations by evening: On the northern front, the entire line of Western Belarus, occupying Grodno; on the southern front, the Western Ukraine front, occupying Kovel and Lviv. In the four days from September 17th to 20th, three Polish infantry divisions, two cavalry brigades, and countless smaller units were disarmed by the Red Army. According to incomplete statistics, over 60,000 Polish soldiers, officers, and non-commissioned officers have been captured. When the fortified areas of Vilnius, Baranovichi, Molodechno, and Sarny were occupied, all their military equipment and supplies were seized. The war booty that has been inventoried includes 280 cannons, 120 aircraft, and other war booty that is still being inventoried. (TASS, 21st)

### German Troops Not Concentrating on Belgian Border, Belgian Side Refutes Rumors

Brussels: In view of repeated reports from British and French sources about German troops concentrating on the Belgian border, the Belgian News Agency issued a statement this afternoon to clarify the situation. It stated that foreign radio stations and newspapers are spreading rumors that foreign troops are concentrating in certain areas along the Belgian border, posing a danger to Belgium. We solemnly declare that, according to authoritative sources, the rumors are groundless. (Haitong, 21st)

### Soviet Fleet Searches for Polish Submarines

Estonia: According to the "Estonian News Agency," the agency is authorized to acknowledge the news about the Soviet fleet blockading Estonian ports. It is reported that Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov has notified the Estonian ambassador to the Soviet Union that the Soviet fleet will pursue Polish submarines that have escaped from Estonia. The Estonian fleet has also taken effective steps to search for escaped submarines. (Haitong, 20th)

### Lithuanian Envoy Visits Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister to Discuss Border Issues

Moscow: The Lithuanian envoy to the Soviet Union, Baltrusaitis, met with Deputy Foreign Affairs Commissar Potemkin yesterday to discuss the issue of Soviet troops occupying the city of Vilnius in northern Poland and reaching the Lithuanian border. According to well-informed sources here, Lithuania and the Soviet Union have always maintained good relations, so the conversation was very sincere. Although Germany had suggested to Lithuania that it send troops to occupy Vilnius as a way to recover lost territory (Vilnius originally belonged to Lithuania but was occupied by Polish troops in 1920), Envoy Baltrusaitis did not raise any request to reclaim the city. In short, Lithuania wishes to remain strictly neutral towards Germany, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France and will wait until the end of the war before making any demands. (Havas, 20th)

### British-German Naval Battle, Cannon Fire Heard in Danish Territory, British Ships Intercept Large Quantities of Contraband

London: The "Exchange Telegraph" newspaper received news from Copenhagen last night that German and British warships fought off the coast of Denmark last night. Residents of Læsø and Kattegat heard cannon fire. The Danish Ministry of Defense yesterday requested an allocation of 20 million Danish crowns to improve anti-aircraft defenses. (Associated Press, 21st)

London: The Ministry of Information recently released a message stating, "From the 9th to the 16th of this month, our warships intercepted 110,000 tons of various goods, valued at over £500,000, all of which were contraband destined for Germany. The largest proportions were manganese, iron ore, aluminum, cotton, and kerosene." (Havas, 20th)

Bucharest: Premier and Minister of National Defense Călinescu was assassinated at 1:45 PM this afternoon. (Havas, 21st)

### Izvestia on the Polish Question: Soviet Military Action Not Contrary to Peaceful Policy

Moscow: An Izvestia editorial stated, "The Red Army, under the orders of the Soviet government, crossed the border on September 17th to protect the lives and property of the people of Western Ukraine and Belarus. The collapse of Poland and its state apparatus is no accident. Poland, as a multi-ethnic state, has always lacked vitality and significance. Poles make up only 60 percent of its population, while minorities account for 40 percent, mainly Ukrainians and Belarusians. These two groups have a total population of 11 million. The Polish ruling class not only failed to establish normal relations with such a large number of minorities, granting them national rights, but also failed to meet the basic conditions for a multi-ethnic state to survive and thrive. On the contrary, the Polish gentry turned the country into a national prison, oppressing and exploiting minorities to the greatest extent, subjecting Ukrainians and Belarusians to particular insults and abuse. Western Ukraine and Western Belarus were effectively colonies of the Polish wealthy, a place for Polish landlords and merchants to plunder. The entire national policy of the Polish ruling class, in a nutshell, was armed suppression, forced assimilation into Polish culture, stirring up ethnic hatred, and white terror, which was no different from the Tsarist rule of Imperial Russia. Precisely for this reason, Poland could not unite internally, and its army, which included Poles, Ukrainians, and Belarusians, could not resist the German advance. After a military defeat, the Polish state immediately collapsed, with riots, disturbances, and anarchy occurring everywhere. Its army, abandoned by its commanders, also disintegrated. The Soviet people have unanimously declared their support for the government's national policy, with an enthusiasm that cannot be described in words. At the same time, the people of Western Ukraine and Belarus, now liberated from the shackles of the Polish gentry, are overjoyed from the bottom of their hearts, a joy that cannot be expressed in words. Since our Red Army entered, the working masses in both areas have welcomed us with all their heart, regarding us as liberating troops. Moving scenes can be seen everywhere. The liberated people of cities and villages are moved to tears, embracing our soldiers and commanders, giving them flowers, and feasting them with delicacies, rushing to comfort our troops. These liberated compatriots know that the Red Army is bringing them the gift of a new life of freedom and happiness. The measures taken by the Soviet government do not violate its peaceful policy. While protecting the people of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, the Soviet government, represented by Molotov, declared that 'all measures will be taken to save the Polish people from the war into which they have been led by their foolish leaders and to give them the opportunity to live peacefully.' The German-Soviet Communique of September 18th also reiterated this key point. Since the Red Army entered Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, the Soviet people have thoroughly demonstrated their patriotic sentiments. Throughout the country, millions of letters and telegrams have been published, unanimously expressing love for the socialist motherland, love for the government, love for the Party, and love for Comrade Stalin, a dear friend of all working people. Our government, having expressed the will of 170 million Soviet people, is unanimously supported by the people of the entire country, ready to thoroughly fulfill its duties to its blood brothers." (TASS, 20th)

### Anglo-French Diplomatic Circles Observe: German-Soviet Friction Inevitable, Romania's Position a Key Factor

London: The diplomatic affairs columnist for the Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, recently wrote that the cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union is not very good and that friction is likely to occur. "When the two countries hastily agreed on the plan to divide Poland, they did not have time to formulate practical methods, and the situation changed rapidly at that time. The original plan was quickly put into practice, and they had to proceed in a competitive manner. So far, no major disputes have occurred between the two sides, but the signs of future disputes and perpetual suspicion have already appeared. It is possible that they will become acute even before the end of the war." In addition, the Soviet government has issued a warning to Estonia regarding the escape of a Polish submarine from Tallinn, Estonia. This could make the countries along the Baltic Sea feel uneasy. The agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union originally placed Lithuania within the German sphere of influence and Finland, Estonia, and Latvia within the Soviet sphere of influence. At this moment, the Soviet Union seems to be creating a pretext to take action against Estonia. (Havas, 21st)

Paris: The relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union has recently been commented on by French newspapers. All agreed that the two countries may not cooperate fully, and the radical socialist newspaper l'Ordre takes the view that the Soviet Union should remain neutral. It is reported that "Britain and France no longer fear that the Soviet Union will seize Bessarabia (a province originally belonging to Russia, which was transferred to Romania after World War I) and believe that the Soviet Union will prevent German troops from invading Romania." (Havas, 21st)

Editorial

### European War: The European Countries

German leader Hitler gave a speech in Danzig on the 19th, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a speech in the Parliament on the 20th. Both speeches were published in yesterday's newspaper. Reviewing the speeches of both sides, there is absolutely no supplement or correction to the current state of the European situation, and there is nothing new to say, so we have no way to make any new evaluation. After the defeat of the Polish army, the Soviet Union sent troops, and the division of Poland by the Soviet Union and Germany is about to be completed. The theory of the European War and the object of the dispute have undergone factual changes; then the British and German authorities should make new suggestions in a timely manner; either the hostility will be even worse, or a sharp turn will happen, which is a matter of common sense, but it is not the case; this is for the sake of the world situation, and we cannot but be disappointed by the speeches of the two.

According to the speeches of the two, there is no reason to stop the state of war, and the inevitable continuation of the European War is its natural conclusion. With the fall of Poland, there is a view that the Eastern Front war will end; after that, the main war will be between the French Maginot Line and the German Siegfried Line. Generally speaking, in terms of the navy, Germany's strength is very different from that of Britain and France, and there is almost no main battle to speak of; the air force is far-reaching, and it should be used to create a new record in the history of war, but both sides are generally equal in strength and have their own concerns, then its initial use is probably only to echo the army and be active in the sky above the border between Germany and France. According to news last night, British troops who crossed the sea to the French front have arrived as scheduled because the stable and convenient communication line has been completed; the German commander and the army and air force have also been transferred from the Eastern Front to the Western Front; such deployments by both sides show where the focus of the European War will be in the future.

The victory or defeat of the war depends on the main force's engagement and the endurance of the economy. The European War is no exception; however, in the current stage of the European War, there is still something other than military and economic factors that can promote changes in the situation, that is, the joys and sorrows of European countries and the grievances and resentments of various ethnic groups. It is still far from the day when Britain, France, and Germany will determine the outcome with military and economic strength; and today, although all countries and ethnic groups on the surface only want to maintain neutrality, they are actually preparing to do something because neutrality is ultimately difficult to maintain; it is almost a matter of pointing fingers that they will take action from preparation. For example, the Soviet Union has already taken action in Poland, but claims to be neutral to Britain and Germany; given the special geographical situation of the Soviet Union, after it has gained something in Poland, it does have the possibility of strengthening its defenses and returning to neutrality; however, there have always been many disturbances in Central and Eastern Europe, such as differences in belief and national sentiment, which are enough to affect the Soviet Union, and how the Soviet Union thinks about Romania, the Baltic Sea, and even the Mediterranean Sea, it is impossible to guarantee that the Soviet Union will remain neutral in the end. For example, Italy and Spain, their conflicting interests with Germany are mainly on land, and their conflicting interests with Britain and France are mainly at sea; as the war drags on, Germany will threaten them, and Britain and France will lure them; the balance of interests is not easy to distinguish, and short-term and long-term considerations are different, but they must choose one of them. Countries such as Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia have already directly felt the threat of the disastrous defeat of Poland; they are concerned about their current safety and the future disasters, and it is not right to welcome or reject the Soviet Union and Germany. For all these countries, with the power of one country, all their actions and inclinations are not enough to determine the victory or defeat of the European War, but their impact on the development of the war situation is extremely profound; if they unite and collude with each other, whether they are jointly opposing Britain and France or jointly containing Germany, it will inevitably be an important factor in the final victory or defeat of both sides, which can be asserted. Therefore, today's Britain, France, and Germany must do their best to engage in military, economic, and national disputes, and what they are most eager to do is to maneuver between various countries. Moreover, it is not only the various countries, but also the Austrian race, the Czech race, the Jewish race, and even the Polish people, who have experienced the pain of national subjugation one after another, and their old and new hatreds are deep and painful; the closeness of these ethnic groups and the love and hatred of ideologies will be the basis for their actions, but the struggle for national survival must transcend the prejudices of emotion and belief. The governments of the belligerent countries can control the army and control materials. How can they make these depressed ethnic groups willingly accept bondage? Yesterday, it was reported that the old Czech state, the new German provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, and even western Slovakia, were determined to revolt, which was inevitable and not unexpected.

How the Western Front war will be is certainly not to be ignored; however, what deserves attention is the movements of the neutral countries in Europe. Military matters are difficult to resolve quickly, but international movements may change rapidly.

### German Planes Fiercely Bombarded, Polish Troops Still Defended Warsaw; Germany Claims That the Polish Army in the South Has Surrendered; Polish Refugees Gathered on the Hungarian Border

Warsaw. The Warsaw City Radio Station recently broadcast a message, stating that enemy planes had fiercely bombed the city today, and many women and children had been killed. The battle situation in the nearby town of Prague was quite fierce, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. Women in our country carried food to the front line to support the soldiers under the artillery fire, and their courage was admirable. In short, no matter how fierce the German army's offensive is, the Warsaw defenders will definitely resist resolutely. Colonel Li Bingsiji, the chief of staff of the defenders, also gave a radio speech, saying that the German army's repeated offensives had been repelled, because our army's morale was high, and its determination to coexist with the city was more important than tanks and kerosene. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

Brussels, Belgium. A reporter from the Belgian Free Press stationed in Poland recently sent a telegram from Serno City, Romania, to explain the current situation in Poland, stating that "the Polish army in the north firmly defended the line of Toruń, Płonsk, and Modlin, and still maintained a mutually supporting posture with the Warsaw defenders. The Polish army in Pomorskie Province in the west firmly defended the line of Łódź, Skierniewice, and Kutno-Łowicz districts, and repelled the German army in Kutno. General Brauchitsch, the commander-in-chief of the German army, has transferred reinforcements to reinforce them. In the south, between the Wieprz River and the San River, the German and Polish armies are still fighting fiercely. The land is a forest area, and the German army's tanks are ineffective. As for Lviv, the German army is attacking it from the west, and the Soviet army is attacking it from the east, but the Polish army is still defending it. In addition, the war situation at the border between Poland and the Soviet Union is also quite fierce. Because the Polish army's front line stretches for 1,400 kilometers and is not easy to defend, it has retreated from both the north and the south, thereby shortening the front line. The Soviet army was able to approach the borders of Romania and Lithuania. The length of the front line has now been reduced to 600 kilometers, and there are many swamps in the area, which is also very conducive to the defenders." (Havas News Agency, 21st)

London. Warsaw Mayor Starzyński gave a radio speech last night, requesting assistance from Britain and France. Radio listeners here were able to hear the suffering of the Polish people. The mayor said, "Our city has been bombed miserably, and hundreds of churches and hospitals have been destroyed, and thousands of Polish women and children have also been killed. Therefore, I really need to appeal to Britain and France for assistance. I don't know when these two countries can provide effective assistance and rescue us from the depths of misery." The mayor had previously clearly told the Polish people, "We and your allied countries are now planning to continue our efforts in order to restore your freedom." (Associated Press, 21st)

Berlin. According to official claims here, after a long period of resistance, the Polish troops south of Samoscz have surrendered to the German army, including two infantry divisions, one cavalry brigade, and one mechanized unit, totaling 11,000 officers and soldiers, along with General Pisto, the commander-in-chief of the Polish army in the south, who have all surrendered. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

Berlin. The German High Command issued a statement today, stating that as of the 20th of this month, the number of prisoners captured has reached 170,000, and the number is still increasing. 320 cannons and 40 armored vehicles were seized. The Polish troops who fought hard near Shamos and Tomanev have surrendered to the German army in the south. The commander-in-chief of the Polish army in the south has also surrendered to Germany. Since September 10, 60,000 prisoners have been captured in the northern region, and 22 heavy cannons and 108 light cannons have been seized. 350 officers and 1,200 prisoners and 40 cannons were captured near Gdynia. Currently, only isolated troops in Warsaw and Modlin are still resisting. It is reported that within a few days, the German High Command will have a detailed report on the German army's war achievements and murals in Poland. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

Paris. Mayor Four of the Municipal Council recently sent a telegram to Warsaw Mayor of Poland, saying, "Your country's army bravely resisted and defended Warsaw, which is commendable. I deeply believe that although your country is now ravaged, it will eventually be restored. Long live Poland!" (Havas News Agency, 21st)

Berlin. According to the official German News Agency, "The war on the Eastern Front has ended, and Germany's goals in Poland have been achieved. The Polish troops, who have been stubbornly resisting in the Vistula Sands for a week, have now been forced to surrender on the Bzura River. The German army has captured 105,000 prisoners, exceeding the Battle of Tannenberg, the largest war in world history. The German Eastern Army captured 92,000 prisoners between August 23 and August 31. The enemy's casualties totaled about 120,000. After destroying the enemy army, the German Eastern Army has now occupied the road money decided by the German and Russian governments. The Russian army occupies the Ukrainian and Belarusian regions, so that the German army can engage in other work." (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

Kyoto Province, Netherlands. According to a message from Berlin, it is said that before the Polish army was defeated, it implemented a scorched earth policy, completely burning all kinds of food to prevent it from being used by the enemy, in order to cause famine in the occupied areas. (Havas News Agency, 20th)

Kyoto City, Hungary. Yesterday, another train of Polish refugees arrived at the border. The train driver had been killed on the way and was driven by the fireman. According to the refugees, the train they were on was bombed by German planes, and several refugees were injured as a result. In addition, many places along the way were also bombed, and many residents were killed and injured. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

London. The strong and unyielding defense of Warsaw has now won the admiration of the world. However, the rapid collapse of the Polish military organization has now been explained. The German army's departure from Slovakia, which caused Katowice and Krakow to be unable to hold out for a long time, was the most serious blow. The Poles themselves deeply regret that they failed to block the mountain pass of the Western Carpathians. I believe that the German army could not quickly penetrate deeply. When the people in Poland did not know that the war had already begun, German planes had already engaged in destroying Polish airfields and railway intersections and disrupting their transportation. After that, the planes surged like an electric current, and the mechanized troops advanced as fast as lightning, making it impossible for the Polish army to retreat in formation. This situation cannot be seen on the Western Front, because both sides on the Western Front have strong positions that make the opportunity equal. (Reuters, 21st)

### The German Army's Victory Was Determined in the Battle of Kutno; The German Army's Encirclement Strategy Was a Great Success; Warsaw No Longer Has Military Importance

Rome. "Stefani News Agency" announced today that reporters from the German military authority received details about the Battle of Kutno and the siege of Warsaw. The Battle of Kutno was the largest battle in the German-Polish war. The elite Polish army fought fiercely and bravely there. The troops concentrated in Kutno had the task of preventing the German army from advancing as much as possible, so that the Polish Supreme Command could calmly assemble troops to defend the new defense line on the Vistula River. Therefore, the Polish army in Kutno had sufficient ammunition, artillery, and food. If these troops could not continue to support, they should gradually retreat towards Warsaw, where reinforcements could be added. However, the German army's encirclement strategy prevented this plan, which was jointly drafted by the French and Polish staff officers on September 4 and 5, from succeeding. The German army quickly entered the Kutno area and the Bzura River area, cutting off the Polish army's retreat route to the east. By the time the Polish Supreme Command began to understand the ultimate goal of the German army's feigned attacks in all directions, it was too late to withdraw the Polish army in the Kutno area. With the assistance of reconnaissance planes, the German army encircled the Polish army from all directions. The Polish army, regardless of the German army's artillery, machine guns, armored vehicles, and aerial bombardment, repeatedly tried to break through and retreat to Warsaw, but failed. The fierce fighting continued for a week, and the Polish army's resistance finally collapsed. Compared with the Battle of Tannenberg, in which the German army captured 30,000 enemy troops on the first day of victory, the Battle of Kutno captured 105,000 people on the first day, and the total number of captures is difficult to estimate. It is likely to be more than 200,000 people. The Polish army suffered heavy casualties, and it can be seen that the entire army was annihilated. It will take a week to sort out the spoils of war. The Polish army suffered a fatal blow in Kutno. The German army's success is due to traditional discipline, excellent organization, close cooperation of various arms, sufficient ammunition, and, importantly, the German soldiers' courage to sacrifice themselves, repeatedly resorting to bayonets and hand grenades to engage in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The infantry's achievements are great. The main force that encircled the Polish army was the infantry. The fastest attackers marched 60 miles in two days and were still able to fight bravely. Therefore, the Battle of Kutno is not only the largest battle in the German-Polish war, but also the largest battle of this century. Regarding the situation in Warsaw, a representative of the German High Command declared that valuable German soldiers and innocent Polish civilians should avoid unnecessary sacrifices as much as possible, because the occupation of Warsaw no longer has military and political importance. Therefore, it was decided to limit military operations in Warsaw and avoid unnecessary bloodshed. At present, Warsaw has been completely isolated. Regarding the situation in eastern Poland, the representative said that the border between Germany and the Soviet Union has been detailed by the governments of the two countries.

### Czech Workers Riot, Clash with German Troops

London. As far as responsible people here know, Czech workers in Prague, Bohemia, a German protectorate, held an anti-German demonstration on the 16th of this month, which soon turned into a riot and clashed with German troops, exchanging fire and causing many casualties. The next day, the people of a certain place in Bohemia and Moravia provinces rose up in response, and by the 19th, it had spread to western Slovakia, where 15,000 troops mutinied and were disarmed by German troops. German authorities in various places have severely punished the rioters. So far, tens of thousands of people have been arrested and imprisoned, and more than a thousand have been executed, but the morale of the people is still extremely high, often fighting the German army with a small number against a large number. Those without firearms use various weapons. The wives and daughters of the workers in Prague even used nailed boards to beat the Germans. In addition, the Czechs have also carried out widespread sabotage in various places, and railways and highway bridges have been destroyed, and tracks, factories, and machines have also been destroyed. The material losses are very heavy. (Havas News Agency, 20th)

### Leaders of the US Republican Party Agree to Amend the Neutrality Act; Issue a Declaration After Attending the White House Meeting; Nine Proposals Submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee

Washington. President Roosevelt invited Republican leaders to the White House on the evening of the 20th for a meeting. According to the communiqué, opinions on the congressional procedures regarding neutrality issues have been completely unified, and a party-wide meeting will be held to prepare for the opening of Congress. It has now been agreed to deal with the neutrality issue from the interests of the entire country rather than from the perspective of the political party. Congress will discuss the issue of whether to retain or abolish the arms embargo clause, and the issue of whether US legislation should be consistent with the legislation of other countries. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

New York. American automobile tycoon Ford said in Detroit today that he personally opposed amending the Neutrality Act, because the drafters of the Act knew the meaning of war, and the European war had nothing to do with the United States. The only people who wanted to amend the Neutrality Act were those who wanted to take advantage of it to manufacture arms on a large scale. Ford believes that the United States amending the Neutrality Act will not shorten the European war. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

Washington. Sixteen national leaders met at the President's Residence at the White House at 4:00 p.m. yesterday (Eastern Standard Time) to discuss the issue of amending the Neutrality Act. Landon, the 1936 Republican presidential candidate, was also one of the attendees. During the White House meeting, 10 national leaders unanimously agreed on the principle of amending the Neutrality Act. After the meeting, a joint declaration was issued, stating that the United States must maintain peace and neutrality, and that Congress and the executive authorities have an understanding agreement regarding these actions. The President's administrative proposals will be handed over to the Foreign Relations Committee of Congress for discussion. Landon refused to express his opinion on amending the Neutrality Act, but according to his close associates, Landon supports repealing the cash-and-carry purchase of arms. Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that he has convened a committee to meet on Friday to discuss President Roosevelt's administrative proposals. Isolationists in Congress are preparing to hold a small group meeting a few hours before Congress opens this morning to discuss coping strategies. Senator Nyeboara, a key member of the isolationists, will attend. Nyeboara said that if the majority of Congressmen support the President's proposals, the isolationists will adopt a moderate approach and propose an amendment, requiring countries that purchase arms to pay an additional 20% or 25% of the original price. When Landon arrived in Washington from Keizers yesterday, he told reporters that he could guarantee that the United States would not be dragged into the vortex of war. (Associated Press, 20th)

Washington. Nine proposals to amend the Neutrality Act, all of which are inconsistent with the proposals of President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, will be submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for consideration when Congress begins its special session today. The President will deliver a speech at that time. The agenda of the Foreign Relations Committee also includes four bills on Japan's undeclared war against China and the United States restricting exports to Japan, and a resolution by Democratic Senator Sheppard to promote world disarmament.

Washington. The US government issued a statement to reporters, stating that the most important issues to be discussed by the temporary Congress are the cancellation of the arms embargo and the restoration of international law procedures. According to the majority opinion, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will handle the legislative matters of this kind of issue as soon as possible after Congress reopens. It is reported that Roosevelt believes that it is better to completely abolish the Neutrality Act than to amend it. However, it is reported that several people have suggested to the President that if the current Neutrality Act is completely abolished, Congress may not agree to it. (Reuters, 20th)

### Soviet-Japanese Negotiations on Various Pending Issues

Tokyo. Soviet Chargé d'affaires Ginaralov visited Mr. Nishi, Director of the European Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, yesterday afternoon to discuss various pending issues between the Soviet Union and Japan. According to the Jiji Shimbun, the recent signing of the ceasefire agreement between the two countries can be guaranteed to adjust relations between each other, and it is predicted that various pending issues can be resolved at an early date.

### Nomura Will Take Office as Japanese Foreign Minister

Tokyo. Some newspapers here are rumored that Admiral Nomura, the principal of the aristocratic school and admiral of the navy, will take over as foreign minister after Abe. However, this statement has not yet been confirmed. The general public believes that the basic policy of the Japanese government towards Europe has already been decided and it is now preparing to take steps to formulate its policy towards countries outside Europe. Therefore, it is believed that the time for Nomura to become foreign minister has matured. Abe's concurrent position as foreign minister is due to the importance of Japan's European policy. For the sake of prudence, he is unwilling to entrust it to others. However, since Abe took office as foreign minister, the European situation has taken a turn for the worse, and affairs have been complicated. It is necessary to appoint a dedicated person to fill this position. Therefore, it is planned to look for capable people to succeed as foreign minister. According to the opinions of some newspapers, Admiral Nomura has special talents and is extremely suitable for this position, and Japanese observers also believe that Nomura is the most qualified person to handle diplomacy at a time when Japanese-American relations are becoming increasingly important. Nomura has visited the United States several times. Twenty years ago, he served as the naval attaché at the Japanese Embassy in the United States. From 1921 to 1922, he represented Japan at the Washington Conference. Nomura was also one of the Japanese representatives at the Paris Peace Conference after the European War. In addition, he has also served as the Deputy Chief of the Naval General Staff, the Commander of the Wu and Yokosuka Naval Ports. During the Battle of Shanghai in 1932, he served as the Commander of the Third Fleet, and was promoted to Admiral of the Navy in 1938. (Reuters, 21st)

### Talk by the Japanese Ambassador to the United States on Trade Agreement Negotiations

Washington - Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Kenkichi Horiuchi, stated to reporters today that the Japan-Soviet armistice agreement is unrelated to the European-American situation and does not signify the imminent signing of a Japan-Soviet non-aggression treaty. Japan and the Soviet Union signed an armistice agreement to seek a rapid resolution of the Sino-Japanese War. Horiuchi stated that in his recent conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Hull, he had established the basis for a new U.S.-Japan trade agreement. Horiuchi also said that Japan advised Britain and France to withdraw their troops from China, as Japan believed that the continued stationing of belligerent troops in China would cause various inconveniences or disputes. Japan has not offered this kind of "friendly advice" to the United States or Italy. (Dispatch from the United Press special correspondent, Gu Mu, dated 21st)

### "Courageous" Sinking Incident Announced by British Naval Minister Churchill in the House of Commons

London - Naval Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons today the sinking of the British aircraft carrier Courageous by a German submarine. He warmly praised the bravery of the ship's officers and men and expressed the government's and the Admiralty's deep sympathy for the families of the deceased. Churchill stated that the Courageous carried 1,202 officers and men, which was slightly less than the full complement because the number of aircraft carried on board had been reduced. Captain Jones went down with the ship. Since the outbreak of the war, the ship had been protecting merchant shipping from submarine attacks and had achieved considerable success in attacking individual submarines. Its sinking is a significant loss. Opposition leader Alexander, on behalf of the entire House, endorsed the Naval Minister's expression of sympathy and praise. In response to questions, Churchill stated that the Courageous had a full escort of destroyers. The Admiralty had expressed clear views before the war on how Britain should deal with submarines, and he saw no reason to doubt the soundness of those views. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### Fierce Fighting in Northern Hunan, Japanese Attempt to Invade Changsha, Stalemate Along the Xinqiang River

Chongqing - According to the Ta Kung Pao today, there has been fierce fighting in the northeastern corner of Hunan in the past three days, reaching its most intense stage yesterday. The Japanese army participating in the fighting consists of several divisions, with the aim of invading Changsha from Yuezhou. The focus of the fighting is currently along the Xinqiang River, 20 miles south of Yuezhou. Yesterday, from morning to noon, the Japanese artillery fired more than 4,000 shells at the Chinese army's positions. It is expected that the fighting there will remain in a stalemate north and south of the Xinqiang River for the next day or two. The Japanese offensive in northern Jiangxi is nothing more than a feint, and their real purpose is to invade Changsha. (United Press dispatch, 21st)

Miluo - The Japanese army in northern Hunan has resolutely attacked the north bank of the Xinqiang River, marking their first major offensive since the loss of Yuezhou last year. From the 18th to the 21st, Chinese and Japanese forces engaged in fierce fighting in the triangular area on the north bank for three days and three nights. According to statistics from a certain division commander at the front line, Japanese casualties were at least 3,000 or more. (Dispatch, 21st)

Pingjiang - The Chinese army in Jiuling launched an attack on Tongcheng in three routes starting on the 20th. After several fierce battles, they completely recovered Tongcheng at 3:30 AM on the 11th. The remaining Japanese forces retreated in disarray to the northwest, and the Chinese army is pursuing them in victory. There are no longer any traces of the Japanese between Jiuling and Tongcheng. (Dispatch, 20th)

Changsha - The Japanese army in northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan launched a comprehensive disruptive attack on the Chinese army starting on the 17th. Battles occurred in Gaoan, Fengxin, and Wuning in northern Jiangxi, Tongcheng in southern Hubei, and on the north bank of Xinqiang in northern Hunan. The Chinese army near Gaoan is putting up a strong resistance to the Japanese army advancing westward. The Chinese army in southern Hubei recovered Tongcheng this morning, creating a gap in the overall Japanese position in northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan. The Chinese army's vigorous resistance on the north bank of Xinqiang should give the Japanese troops supporting the westward advance in Gaoan a jolt. Overall, the Japanese army's actions in northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan in the past few days, while fierce, still amount to disruptive attacks, differing only in that they are slightly larger in scale than before. (Dispatch, 21st)

### Japanese Troops Increase in Hengmen Area

Macau - The number of Japanese troops in the Hengmen area has recently been gradually increasing, and new soldiers have also arrived around Tangjiawan. It is expected that there will be a large-scale offensive soon. Japanese aircraft are constantly reconnoitering the actions of the defending forces. Japanese warships bombarded the coast near Xiangzhou today. The sound of the cannons was quite clear in Macau. Judging from various signs, the Japanese army will soon cut off traffic between Hengmen and Macau. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### People's Political Council Sends Telegram of慰問 to Compatriots in Northeast China

Chongqing - The closing date of the Fourth Plenary Session of the National People's Political Council coincided with the eighth anniversary of the September 18th Incident. The Council unanimously decided to send a telegram in the name of the Council to express its慰問 to the compatriots in Northeast China. The original text of the telegram is recorded as follows: To the compatriots in the four northeastern provinces: Since the fall of the Northeast, our compatriots have been groaning under the iron heel and enduring oppressive rule for eight years now. In these eight years, our government and people in various places have never forgotten our compatriots in the Northeast for a single day, nor have they stopped thinking about recovering our Northeast territory. Therefore, there are armies resisting the war, the whole nation is united, victory is expected, and the recovery of lost land is within reach. Our compatriots in the Northeast have been longing for an army to avenge their shame for a long time. More and more young people are serving in the interior, and righteous armies are rising up behind enemy lines like swarms of bees. Today, Japan's vigor is waning, and its momentum is like the setting sun. The Chinese army is brave and its spirit runs through the Changhong. It is hoped that our compatriots in the four provinces will respond to the great cause of the national resistance war with a spirit of perseverance, unite internally and externally, annihilate the tyranny, and recover our lost land. On the day of the closing of the Fourth Session of this Council, which coincides with the anniversary of the September 18th Incident, we feel even more inspired when we look back on the past and look forward to the future. We hereby send a telegram of慰問 to encourage each other in the future. National People's Political Council. (Dispatch, 21st)

### China Strictly Neutral on European Situation

Chongqing - Informed sources here publicly stated that "China is determined not to share its fate with any side in the European war, as China's only goal is to continue to resist Japan. China wishes to maintain friendly relations with all other countries except Japan. Therefore, it is completely wrong to think that China is only on friendly terms with Britain. In fact, government officials attach great importance to Sino-German relations. In the current situation, China's attitude towards the European war remains strictly neutral. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 21st)

### China's Resistance War Not Hampered - Li Zongren's Statement

Hong Kong - General Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army on the north bank of the Yangtze River, told visiting reporters this morning that the Japanese army is unlikely to launch a large-scale offensive into the interior of China and will instead consolidate the positions they have occupied. At the same time, the Japanese will attempt to use political means, such as establishing puppet governments, to bring the Sino-Japanese War to an early end. Developments in Europe have no impact on China's determination and strength to resist the war. Li also mentioned rumors of Soviet-Japanese negotiations, saying that if the Soviet Union and Japan conclude any agreement, it will not affect the Soviet Union's policy of providing material assistance to China. For its own interests, the Soviet Union will naturally help China resist the war. Even if the Soviet Union can no longer supply China with military supplies, or China can no longer purchase arms from overseas, China can still continue to resist the war and will not be seriously affected, as China currently has sufficient stockpiles of arms and ammunition and can manufacture small arms and ammunition itself. Japan's policy of using Chinese to control Chinese is bound to fail. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### American Reporter Visits Zhu Jiaji in Chongqing

Chongqing - A reporter from the New York Times recently visited Secretary-General Zhu Jiaji at the Central Party Headquarters and asked the following questions: (1) What is Japan's intention in sending Shigeru Nishio as Commander-in-Chief in China? (2) What are your views on the situation caused by the European war? Secretary-General Zhu answered as follows: (1) Japan's sending of Nishio as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in China is, in terms of its effect on China, the last resort of a spent arrow, an attempt to try again. However, the Japanese army has repeatedly tried and failed in the past, and will inevitably continue to sink into a quagmire from which it cannot extricate itself. Since Japan launched its war of aggression, its command has changed with the seasons, and its troops in China have been plagued by infighting and suspicion. This shows the increasing internal difficulties and the exposure of weaknesses. Nishio's arrival is intended to resolve these contradictions, but the Japanese military in China has long developed a situation in which the tail wags the dog, and Nishio can do nothing about it. On the contrary, it is expected that he will only make things more chaotic. (2) We are truly saddened by the outbreak of the European war. As President Chiang stated on August 29, only aggressors who deliberately destroy peace, such as the Japanese warlords, would hope for a world war. Now that hostilities have unfortunately broken out, we urgently hope that they will not spread and that a way to restore peace can be found as soon as possible, so that mankind will not suffer a more brutal catastrophe and will see light and peace again. People often think of the impact of the European war on the Far East, especially on the Sino-Japanese War. The impact cannot be said to be non-existent, but China will adhere to its established policy to adapt to the drastically changing international situation. What is this policy? It is to strengthen the resistance war to win victory and to unite with all friendly countries to destroy Japan's aggressive violence. As for the way out for human peace, Mr. Sun Yat-sen had already spoken of it with great concern. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen was engaged in the great industrial plan to develop China just after the end of the European War, when the countries engaged in the Great War were suffering from a lack of resources for reconstruction, he believed that only this plan could enrich the international peace advocated by President Wilson at the time and eliminate the causes of international war that would be recreated by countries following the old path of commercial warfare after the war. We adhere to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and never waver. Therefore, we sincerely welcome all our friendly countries to carry out economic and technical cooperation with China. However, this kind of cooperation must eliminate Japan's ambition to exclude the rights and interests of various countries in the Far East and to dominate East Asia before it can be realized. The factor of world peace is in China, and today it is clear. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan has always been a good solution to the cycle of wars and a major way to save the current European crisis. However, we must accelerate China's victory before we can seek peaceful construction. Therefore, helping China resist the war is also a major plan for world peace once and for all. (Dispatch, 20th)

### United Press Has Close Relationship with China

Chongqing - The Shishi Xinbao editorial here today stated that it is a great mistake to think that Britain is the sole supporter of the Chinese legal tender in China. In fact, only the Soviet Union and the United States are the countries from which our foreign loans come. Moreover, from China's current standpoint, only the Soviet Union and the United States have a close relationship with China. Therefore, there is no possibility of China's economic collapse. Furthermore, China currently has enough arms stockpiled for two years. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

Chongqing - The Ta Kung Pao editorial today stated that the United States' concentration of its naval power in the Pacific Ocean is sufficient to indicate that the United States is a stabilizing force in the Far East. It is hoped that the United States will make good use of this power. The U.S.-Japan trade agreement should no longer be continued. The resolution proposed by Pittman to impose economic sanctions on Japan should be implemented quickly. If the United States were to stop all assistance to Japan, Japan's war against China would be impossible to continue. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

### Drainage Begins in Tianjin Japanese Concession

Peiping - The authorities of the Japanese Concession in Tianjin began drainage work yesterday. The water depth within the Japanese Concession is four to six feet, and traffic in several places still relies on boats. Residents have been living on the second floor of their homes for almost a month. The Japanese have built dikes on three sides of the concession and installed four Lulis pumping machines on the dikes. Drainage work began last night. The dikes are 4,160 meters long and 4 meters wide, and their height is proportional to the depth of the water. The fourth side of the Japanese Concession was not flooded due to its higher terrain. The dike construction work began on September 1st and was only completed yesterday. Japanese engineers here claim that there are 900 million gallons of water in the Japanese Concession, which can be drained by the end of this month. The number of pumping machines will soon be increased to 100. Although the flooding in the British and French Concessions is lighter, drainage work also began yesterday. The authorities of the various concessions lack cooperation in flood prevention and relief work. Observers say that if all parties could work together, the number of dikes could be reduced by half. Engineers say that if the concessions carry out drainage work at the same time, the water in the Hai River will rise, further hindering the clearing work. The Japanese estimate that the Japanese Concession has suffered losses of over 400 million Japanese yen. Residents in the Japanese Concession mostly rely on charities and savings for a living, because all industries have been suspended. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

### Chinese Side Officially Denies Peace Talks

Chongqing - The rumors of Sino-Japanese peace negotiations circulating in Shanghai have been officially denied by the Chinese government here. According to Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's statement to the Associated Press, these rumors are completely unfounded. China is not prepared to accept any peace proposals that are not based on fair terms. The so-called fair terms are the guarantee of China's integrity and the automatic cessation of aggression by Japan. Otherwise, we will continue to resist the war until a fair and lasting peace is realized. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

### Chamberlain's Report on the War Situation - Determined to Help Poland to the End, Deep Preparations for Military Affairs

London - British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered his third post-war speech on the war situation in the House of Commons today, stating that while Poland was fighting hard to resist the German army, an incident suddenly occurred on September 17 that had a decisive impact on the eastern front. On that evening, Soviet troops suddenly invaded the Polish border along the entire line. The Polish army, already under great pressure from resisting the German army, faced this new enemy, and the seriousness of the impact can be imagined. However, the Polish army continues to fight. What is the motive and consequence of the Soviet Union's action? It is not yet possible to draw a conclusion. Poland has unfortunately encountered this attack, and the result is the most terrible tragedy. The world watches with deep sympathy as the Polish people fight against the majority, and everyone admires their courage, because the Polish people still do not admit defeat. Although Britain and France have not been able to reverse the Polish army's defeat, they have guaranteed to Poland that Britain and France will never forget their obligations to Poland, nor will they weaken their determination to fight to the end.

### Hitler's Hysterical Words

The Prime Minister mentioned Hitler's speech, saying, "Our country is accustomed to not making boastful or intimidating remarks. This is probably why the German leader is not easy to understand us. Now, when I criticize Hitler's speech, I still do not deviate from our country's habit of speaking solemnly and leisurely. The words that Herr Hitler uttered in Danzig yesterday do not change the current situation, and the facts he stated cannot be considered accurate. His words contain a certain guarantee, but Hitler has wantonly destroyed this guarantee in recent years. There are still many promises in it. I cannot help but mention one thing, especially his statement that the French government has agreed to accept Italian mediation, while the British government has refused. In fact, the official communiqué issued by the Italian official news agency on September 4 has already responded to Hitler's statement, because this communiqué clearly announced the common attitude adopted by the British and French governments. Hitler also extravagantly talked about his humane methods of warfare. I cannot help but say that methods of warfare cannot become humane facts simply because they are given the beautiful name of humanity. The records of Germany bombing undefended cities and machine-gunning refugees have now shaken the world. The German young men who have perished in the war created by Hitler, or the women and children who have lost their parents because Hitler is determined to satisfy his hegemonic ambitions, Hitler did not mention a word of them in his speech. As for the purpose of Britain's warfare, it is to liberate Europe from the eternal terror of Germany's endless cycle of aggression, and to enable the people of Europe to maintain their independence and freedom. Britain holds this purpose, and so does France, and it will not change due to any threat. The British government is not seeking war and has repeatedly announced its readiness to engage in negotiations for a peaceful resolution. The documents that have already been published can be reviewed. Unfortunately, its efforts and hopes to achieve this goal were shattered by Germany's brutal invasion of Poland."

### Smooth Military Progress on the Western Front

The Prime Minister said regarding the western front that the French army continued to make orderly progress, occupying destinations of strategic value, and holding the positions it occupied under the daily increasing resistance of the German army.

### Resisting German Submarines

The Prime Minister then spoke of resisting submarines, saying that in the half-month since the start of the war, resisting submarines has been effective, incomparable to the previous war. In the previous war, Britain focused on defense against submarines, while this time it is taking the offensive, currently searching for German submarines and attacking them. It is estimated that six or seven German submarines have been punished for attacking British ships. When the entire escort system is implemented and the number and effectiveness of aircraft searching for German submarines increase, the harm caused by German submarines will be quickly eliminated. We cannot honestly avoid occasional blows or encounters with major blows such as the loss of the Courageous. However, this is something that cannot be avoided in wartime. We now understand that the navy and merchant ships, with their continued efforts, are now able to maintain the necessary supply of military raw materials and food. During the previous European War, the average weekly loss of ships was thirty-nine, while in the first week of this war, seventeen ships were lost, and in the second week, thirteen ships were lost. A total of one hundred and thirty-nine British and neutral crew members died in submarine attacks, but the loss of the Courageous is not included. It is reported that a total of four hundred and twenty-four crew members of the Courageous are missing.

### British Maritime Policy

The Prime Minister spoke of maritime policy, saying that the purpose of this policy is to destroy enemy warships, prevent their supply of military goods from overseas, and protect the trade of Britain and neutral countries. In wartime as in peacetime, the interests of neutral countries are also the interests of Britain, because the life of Britain depends on the uninterrupted flow of trade. Therefore, maintaining the usual state of trade to the extent possible is our basic policy. Although the interception of contraband cannot but cause inconvenience to neutral countries, our control measures are carried out entirely in accordance with established principles of international law. We will only exercise our right of inspection when there are good reasons to suspect that contraband is being transported to the enemy. Goods normally needed by neutral countries for their own consumption will not be interfered with in general. The application of the enemy contraband management mechanism and the public trial by the capture court in accordance with the law, and the central government's strict adherence to regulations, are quite different from the policies pursued by Germany. The exercise of its rights by our maritime power has never harmed lives, nor has it illegally detained the property of neutral countries. As for the methods of submarine warfare and laying mines used by Germany on the high seas, they kill many innocent people regardless of nationality and cause unwarranted destruction of the property of neutral countries.

### Joint Anglo-French Operations

The Prime Minister spoke of the situation of the Anglo-French operations, saying that Britain and France are now making great preparations to build up our army and air force. However, one thing that must not be forgotten is that in various military preparations, the initial advantage lies with the aggressor. But our resources are now concentrated, and if the actual results are not immediately apparent, we must be patient and wait for them. The Prime Minister also reiterated the issues of the domestic home guard, civil defense, and the evacuation of residents, saying that the fact that Britain has not encountered an air raid in the first three weeks of the war is not a reason to relax domestic defense forces.

### Dominion Mobilization

The Prime Minister spoke of the overseas Dominions, saying that the various self-governing governments are continuing to prepare so that they can actively participate in the great struggle at hand. The people of the Dominions have already expressed their eagerness to serve in the war that has now begun, and I think the members of Parliament will be greatly moved by this. At this time, the entire British Empire is actively mobilizing its full strength and gathering under our three armed forces of the sea, land, and air. The concentration of strength is stronger than ever before at the beginning of a war. The extent of our efforts is gradually expanding in all aspects. But today I want to issue a warning: the government is now working with military advisors in the closest contact and mutual trust. The government will not do anything that our military advisors disagree with. If our responsible advisors and our allied countries and ourselves believe that an action will make a substantial contribution to victory, then we will take any action, even if it involves sacrifices, we will not avoid it. However, we do not want to engage in risky and speculative actions that do not have a great hope of success, or that may damage our strength and delay the final victory. For lucky situations, the lessons given by military personnel are the way to disaster. I do not want to make any guesses at this time as to when or where the decisive military forces can be assembled, or when the decisive battle can be fought. In fact, such actions are unpredictable. However, the scope of our preparations means that all the preparations we have announced are based on at least three years of war. This ensures that our strength will continue to increase to cope with any future events. A famous Polish general recently said goodbye to the Anglo-French military mission, "We will fight, most of our land will be trampled by the enemy, and we will suffer terrible pain, but if you come to our aid, we are sure that we will be able to recover." This can also be the conclusion of my speech today. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

### Military Commission Announces War Situation on All Fronts in the Past Week, September 12th to 19th

Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Commission said that the enemy on all fronts has gradually become more active this week than last week. Under our strong attacks, the enemy's attempts to invade have not succeeded. Now our loyal soldiers are fighting fiercely with the enemy on the northern and southern battlefields, and have achieved many victories. The course of the battle is summarized as follows:

Jin-Sui Front: The war in Shanxi Province is going very smoothly. In southeastern Shanxi, we once recovered Huguan last week and cut off the enemy's communication between Changzi and Changzhi. At the weekend, the enemy gathered their defeated troops and launched a desperate counterattack, fighting fiercely with our army around Huguan and northeast of Changzi and southwest of Changzhi. At present, the three gates of Huguan, east, north, and south, are still being besieged by us. We have killed more than 800 enemies in the past few days. The enemy in Changzi and Changzhi are also exhausted. Another part of our army attacked the enemy on the Hongtun Avenue. On the 15th and 16th, we successively recovered the important towns of Hechuanfu and Fucheng, killing 400 to 500 enemies below the Miyata Brigade. The enemy in Fenyang, Fencheng, Jishan, Fenxi, and Xiaoyi in western Shanxi attacked westward in several directions, and were repeatedly severely damaged by us. The enemy commander Yamaguchi and other officers and soldiers were killed by us in large numbers, and they have retreated back to their original routes. In northern Shanxi, the enemy invaded Kelan and Wuzhai, and also had several fierce battles with our army, all of which were repelled. In the Wutai area, our army also killed many enemies. In the Sui area, after our army recovered Pingfanggou (west of Baotou) last week, they continued to attack Kundulun for several days, killing more than 800 enemies, and seizing 3 light machine guns and more than 500 rifles. The remaining enemies have collapsed and retreated to Baotou, and are unable to attack again.

Hunan-Jiangxi Front: The enemy in northern Hunan launched a large-scale invasion towards us by land and water this week. On the land route, under the cover of artillery fire on the evening of the 18th, they attacked Xinqianghe in two directions, one from Yueyang attacking Daqiaoling and Yao Haizhou, and the other from Taolin attacking Lijiawan. The momentum was very fierce. In order to lure the enemy deep into the position, we retreated slightly. Later, the officers and soldiers counterattacked in separate directions and fought bravely in hand-to-hand combat. By dawn on the 19th, the enemy could not support it and collapsed. All these areas were completely recovered. More than 2,000 enemy corpses were left behind. Another part of our army attacked the enemy's rear and once rushed into Yanglousi, capturing many enemies. More than a dozen enemy warships landed at Tuanhe and Xinhekou, but were met with a head-on blow, and the enemy did not succeed. They have now retreated back to the warships, and our army is still closely monitoring them. In Jiangxi Province, the enemy in Nanchang, Fengxin, and Anyi attacked Maqiu and Gaoan fiercely from the 15th. Our army resisted calmly and annihilated more than 1,000 enemies. The Maqiu position was lost and recovered. A heroic battle for Gaoan and the surrounding areas. Our surprise troops also raided the enemy's rear in separate directions, killing many enemies.

Henan-Hubei Front: In Henan Province, the war between our army and the enemy has been fierce this week. Our officers and soldiers have repeatedly frustrated the enemy's offensives and recovered many areas. Our army, which attacked the Qinchong and Qinbo highway areas in northern Henan, captured Wenxian and Chongyi on the 13th. At present, the two county towns of Qinyang and Boai have been completely controlled by us. Our army along the Taoqing line captured the strongholds of Wucheng, Beixiaocun, and Wuliyuan in the western section, and occupied Shangguancun southeast of □ County and Niushitun southwest of it in the eastern section, threatening the enemy's rear. Kaifeng in eastern Henan was once rushed into by us, burning the enemy's supply warehouses and automobile factories, and seizing many supplies. The county town of Lanfeng was also bravely captured by us at dawn on the 14th, killing many enemies. The enemy's Xu-Hai transportation was cut off, and the enemy trapped in Kaifeng was extremely shaken. North of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province, the war situation has been quiet this week. In southern Hubei, Tongshan County was captured three times on the 14th, and the strongholds of Shentang, Sishaxia Town, and Saigongqiao were captured on the 15th. The enemy fled in panic, and suffered heavy casualties.

Guangdong Front: Conghua was recovered by us last week, and we took advantage of the victory to advance. By the 14th, the enemy transported more than 1,000 enemy corpses from Taipingchang to Guangzhou, including several senior enemy officers. In Huaxian, we once rushed into the city last week and cleared the remaining enemies in Jiekou and Aotou. We launched another attack on the county town on the 13th and immediately captured it. At present, the remaining enemies are entrenched in Longkou and dare not move rashly. In total, the enemy in this area escaped north this time, and were bravely repelled by our officers and soldiers. The extent of their losses is unprecedented since the enemy invaded the south. The enemy on the Hengmen sea repeatedly invaded Zhongshan, but were repelled. On the 14th, more than 1,000 enemies attacked Zhangjiabian fiercely, but were met with a head-on blow, killing more than 500 enemies and sinking more than a dozen speedboats. A part of the remaining enemies retreated to the warships, and a part collapsed and retreated to Shanzhou. At present, there are no traces of the enemy in Zhangjiabian. Our army raided Dalian on the evening of the 15th and fought fiercely with the enemy all night, killing many enemies. Dalian was once recovered on the evening of the 17th, and many victories were achieved.

In addition, Jibei Province captured Nanle and Xinhe, besieged Daping, Shandong Province recovered Tancheng, broke into Jiaoji Qianmingshui Station, and Lijiazhuang north of Linyi, and defeated 500 enemies in the Tai'an area. Northern Jiangsu captured Ganyu and forced the Xu County town. South of the Yangtze River, a large-scale defeat of the enemy invading Baishi and Baihu annihilated more than 400 enemies. In the Wujiang area, more than 300 enemies were killed. In western Zhejiang, a raid into Nanxun Town are all important victories in the past week. A supplementary report is attached here.

The distribution methods are recorded as follows: (1) All schools that have received war zone middle school students distributed by the Ministry of Education should try their best to accommodate them and should not make things difficult. Those who are unable to accommodate all of them in fact may report the situation of those who have not been accommodated to the Ministry and ask for other arrangements to be made. (2) When schools accept these students, they should order the students to present photos, certificates, or registration certificates, insert them into the appropriate grade, and may at any time assess their performance and assign them to a higher or lower grade. Those who cannot study with the class and have no grade to demote should also be given the opportunity to make up lessons. (3) When schools accept these students, the various fees that should be charged should be in accordance with the following regulations: A. Tuition, no charge for those who cannot afford it. Private schools may be ordered by the Ministry to subsidize half of their total tuition by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education. B. Food expenses, half or full exemption for those from poor families, report to the Ministry for arrangements, and be borne by the public. C. Accommodation fees, no charge. D. Fees for books and supplies are borne entirely by the students themselves. (4) Schools should strictly conduct separate talks with students who request exemption from tuition and half or full food expenses, and examine their living conditions to make careful decisions. If there are any cases of abuse, after being found out, they should be ordered to pay the full amount. (5) If schools need to add equipment for classrooms and dormitories due to the accommodation of these students, they are allowed to report the facts to the Ministry, and the Ministry will order the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education to allocate funds.

Foreign Exchange Bulls Emerge in Large Numbers, Market Momentum Continues to Loosen, US Exchange Rate Already Exceeds Seven Yuan

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC's listed prices, all remained unchanged. The unofficial British-US exchange rate, due to the US exchange rate against the British pound, saw a rebound of 1.25 points. Therefore, the morning opening continued to show a trend of the British pound being stable and the US dollar loosening. The British gold rate remained at four pence and twenty-five, while the US dollar rate rose to six yuan and ninety-three seventy-five. After the opening, due to a sudden rumor from the previous evening that former Prime Minister Konoe had secretly flown to Haiphong and Hanoi, sellers flocked in, with Chinese merchants being particularly eager to sell. Consequently, the market momentum hardened, with the British pound reaching four pence and thirty-seven seventy-five, and the US dollar reaching seven yuan and eighteen seventy-five. Subsequently, due to the Bank of England, HSBC, and others strengthening their absorption capacity, and importers also coming to close out positions, the market slightly tightened. The British pound retreated to four pence and twenty-eight one two five, and the US dollar also retreated to seven yuan. In the afternoon, a ridiculous rumor suddenly spread in the market about the withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in North China, leading to even more talk of so-called peaceful atmosphere. As a result, bulls from Chinese banks, Chinese merchant securities firms, and others emerged in large numbers. Although the Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank came to absorb, the buying interest from foreign banks weakened, causing the situation to loosen and harden again. The closing price for the day was at the loosest price of four and a half pence and seven yuan forty sixty-two five. Futures for September and October also loosened accordingly. Trading throughout the day was fairly active.

Importers Still Closing Out Positions

At the start of the morning, London's major exchanges continued to rise by 0.0625 points for both near and far contracts. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London bullion remained fixed. The exchange rate for the British pound against the US dollar, Shanghai dollar, and French franc remained flat. The US dollar against the British pound rebounded by 1.25 points, was slightly up by five points against the Shanghai dollar, and remained unchanged against the French franc. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were four pence and twenty-five for the British pound and six yuan and ninety-three seventy-five for the US dollar, which was unchanged for the British pound and up by 0.0625 for the US dollar compared to the previous close, due to the rebound of the US dollar exchange rate against the British pound. After the opening, due to the rumor from the previous evening that former Prime Minister Konoe had flown from Hong Kong to Haiphong and Hanoi, Chinese merchants came to dump their holdings, and Chinese banks also released some. As a result, the market immediately loosened and hardened. Chinese merchants and Chinese banks successively sold spot British pounds to Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, Dutch banks, and certain American banks, with the price hardening from four pence and thirty-one twenty-five to thirty-seven seventy-five, and spot US dollars rising from seven yuan to seven yuan and eighteen seventy-five. After HSBC's listed prices were announced to be unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be two and a half percent, certain banks absorbed October US dollars at seven yuan from Chinese banks. At that time, HSBC and Banque Franco-Chinoise's absorption capacity improved, and they bought spot British pounds at four pence and thirty-seven seventy-five from Chinese merchants. Subsequently, the selling pressure from Chinese merchants and others slightly subsided, and importers suddenly came to buy, causing the situation to soften slightly. Foreign firms closed out positions and bought spot British pounds at four pence and thirty-one twenty-five and twenty-eight one two five from HSBC, and also bought spot US dollars at seven yuan and six twenty-five and seven yuan from certain banks. Extending to the afternoon close, the bank's spot selling prices were four pence and thirty-one twenty-five for the British pound and seven yuan and six twenty-five for the US dollar. It was heard that the underlying trend after the close was hardening, with foreign firms mutually trading spot British pounds at four pence and thirty-seven seventy-five.

British Gold Reaches Four and a Half Pence

In the afternoon, around 1 p.m., a ridiculous rumor suddenly spread in the market about the withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in North China. As a result, selling pressure intensified after the opening. Chinese banks, East Asia Bank, and Chinese merchant securities firms all competed to sell. Although the Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank took the opportunity to absorb at low prices, the buying interest from foreign banks was weak, causing the market momentum to be quite loose and excessive. Chinese merchants and Chinese banks successively sold spot British pounds to foreign firms Chase Bank, Banque Franco-Chinoise, and the Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank, with the price hardening to half a pence from four pence and thirty-seven seventy-five, and spot US dollars rising to forty-three seventy-five from twenty-one two five. Extending to the evening close, the bank's spot selling prices were four and a half pence for the British pound and seven yuan and forty sixty-two five for the US dollar. The prices for the current month were the same as the spot prices. October British gold was four pence and forty-five three one two five, and the US dollar was seven yuan and twenty-five. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot and current-month British pounds both loosened by twenty-five, and US dollars both hardened by fifty-three one two five. October British pounds were cheaper by twenty-three four three seven five, and US dollars rose by fifty-six two five.

Hong Kong US Dollar Also Loosens

Hong Kong, 21st telegram: The exchange market opened steadily today. The spot British pound remained unchanged, and the forward rate rose by 0.0335 to one shilling and two pence nine six eight seven five.

### Cash Falls Sharply with Foreign Exchange, Securities Firms Still Tend to Sell, Low Price Seen at Three Thousand Seven Hundred Yuan

Yesterday's Shanghai red cash unofficial market situation saw a strong decline, with prices retreating to the edge of the three thousand seven hundred yuan level. This was due to the increasing rumors of Sino-Japanese peace, claiming that former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe had flown to Haiphong and Hanoi, and that Japanese troops stationed in North China had withdrawn, and other kinds of absurd rumors enveloping the market. Furthermore, the central government had nationalized gold, repeatedly stating that it would be purchased by the four banks of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank. As a result, the morale of all parties became more and more depressed. Foreign exchange loosened sharply, and gold prices were even more sluggish and unable to rise. From the morning, it inherited the previous night's decline, and the market immediately fell to three thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan. However, due to the loosening of foreign exchange and the return to stability, and the Hakka merchants inclined to buy when they saw low prices, a wave of rising prices was triggered, and it briefly flew up to a high price of three thousand eight hundred and ninety yuan. Near noon, the atmosphere of peace suddenly thickened, and Hong Kong merchants suddenly came out to sell, and the market momentum turned weak. After the afternoon close, it had already fallen to below three thousand eight hundred yuan. In the afternoon, rumors spread that Japan was withdrawing its troops stationed in North China, and that peace between China and Japan was being realized. In addition, foreign exchange loosened sharply, and securities firms tended to sell, which further fueled the already strong decline, and it actually plunged to a low price of three thousand seven hundred yuan. Finally, due to a lack of goods being released to cover positions, it pulled up to close at three thousand seven hundred and thirty yuan, a sharp drop of two hundred and fifty yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was about three thousand taels. Jewelry gold also fell to three hundred and seventy-five yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained flat across the board.

Shanghai Red Drops Two Hundred and Fifty Yuan

From the morning, the market showed a scattered image for each bar (ten taels). The general multi-neck panic rose again. In addition, foreign exchange hardened, and the intention to sell was even more urgent. The sellers shouted three thousand eight hundred yuan, but the buyers were still watching. It fell another fifty yuan, and money exchange businesses mutually traded ten taels for three thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan, a sharp drop of two hundred and thirty yuan compared to the previous night's close. Subsequently, the loosening of foreign exchange slowed down, and a certain silver shop and a certain money exchange business absorbed at low prices on behalf of the Shantou merchants. In addition, securities firms also had appetite, so the price suddenly rebounded by one hundred and ten yuan. A certain silver shop bought a total of thirty taels of spot cash from cash shops and peers for three thousand eight hundred and sixty yuan. After that, the silver shop's supply intention was more active, and foreign exchange continued to loosen, so it suddenly fell again, immediately dropping sixty yuan. Money exchange businesses mutually traded ten taels for three thousand eight hundred yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop suddenly came to absorb on behalf of speculators, and money exchange businesses also bought more and sold less. In addition, foreign exchange softened, and it suddenly rose again, soon soaring ninety yuan. The current life number bought ten taels from the money exchange business for three thousand eight hundred and ninety yuan. After eleven o'clock, the rumors rose again, and many scattered retail investors came to settle their positions. It was also heard that a certain money exchange business also sold on behalf of Hong Kong merchants, so the price became weak again. Before long, it fell seventy-five yuan, and the cash shop sold twenty taels to the money exchange business for three thousand eight hundred and fifteen yuan, making it the afternoon close price. The underlying trend after the closing was continuing to weaken, and the price broke through the three thousand eight hundred yuan level, with money exchange businesses mutually trading ten taels for three thousand seven hundred and eighty-five yuan, due to the hardening of foreign exchange after the close. In the afternoon, rumors in the market were even more prevalent, and it was heard that foreign exchange hardened. As a result, scattered retail investors all had the intention to sell, but at that time a certain money exchange business still had appetite, so the initial opening was only five yuan lower than the afternoon close price. Money exchange businesses mutually traded thirty taels at a price of three thousand seven hundred and eighty yuan. After the opening, securities firms also came to sell, and in addition, buyers were lacking, so it dropped forty yuan. Securities firms sold twenty taels to the money exchange business for three thousand seven hundred and forty yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop suddenly came to aggressively buy (it was said that it was absorbing on behalf of Hong Kong merchants) and immediately rebounded by fifty yuan. A certain gold shop bought ten taels from the money exchange business for three thousand seven hundred and ninety yuan. After that, the trade side's intention to buy turned weak, and in addition, securities firms rose up to sell again, and foreign exchange loosened sharply, so it fell sharply again by ninety yuan. Securities firms sold thirty taels to the money exchange business for three thousand seven hundred yuan. After entering, silver shops and money exchange businesses came to absorb in alliance, and the market momentum stabilized. Silver shops and money exchange businesses bought a total of fifty taels from a certain gold shop for three thousand seven hundred and thirty yuan as the evening close price. As a result, it plummeted by two hundred and fifty yuan compared to the previous day's evening close. It was heard that after the close, another securities firm in the market bought ten taels from a silver shop for three thousand seven hundred and thirty-five yuan. The fluctuation for the whole day was one hundred and ninety yuan. The cash shop's own brand gold was ten yuan higher than the Shanghai red, and the current bid gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Decreases by Another Fifteen Yuan

The selling price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael decreased because a certain atmosphere rose up again yesterday evening, causing a sharp drop outside the Shanghai red market. Therefore, the listed price was reduced by ten yuan at 7 p.m., to three hundred and ninety yuan. Until noon today, it was lowered by another five yuan. At 2 p.m., it was lowered by five yuan, and at 4 p.m., it was lowered by another five yuan. As a result, it was lowered by a total of fifteen yuan on the day. It is estimated that Da Tonghang changed its version to three hundred and seventy-five yuan, and Xin Tonghang changed its version to three hundred and seventy-three yuan, with the purchase price reduced by about twenty yuan.

### Rumors Still Not Dispersed, Foreign Currency Downtrend Rises Again

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw constant loosening in the exchange market and strong price declines in the gold market, which further fueled the anxiety of those who stored it. However, the morning's rise and fall were still quite fleeting. US dollar notes initially traded at fourteen yuan and ten cents, then rose to fourteen yuan and fifty and a half cents. At noon, it retreated to fourteen yuan and thirty cents. In the afternoon, due to various rumors rising, the selling sentiment suddenly increased. As a result, US dollar notes retreated to thirteen yuan and sixty cents, a drop of nine and a half cents. British gold notes fell by two yuan and fifty cents, gold pounds fell by six yuan and fifty cents and seven yuan, Hong Kong notes fell by eighteen cents, Singapore notes and Dutch notes each fell by forty-five cents, rupee notes fell by fifteen cents, Canadian notes fell by seventy cents, Philippine notes fell by thirty cents, Italian notes fell by one cent, Japanese gold notes decreased by five li, and Korean notes remained unchanged. However, French franc notes still rose by one cent.

### Discount Rate Falls and Then Recovers, Still Stands at Eighty Yuan

Yesterday's exchange bill discount rate once fell sharply, and then rebounded to flat. The initial rate was still eighty yuan per thousand yuan. The supply of cash exceeded demand, and it immediately fell to a low price of sixty-seven yuan and a half. In the afternoon, some people took the opportunity to buy cash at low prices, so it gradually rebounded, and finally returned to flat at eighty yuan, the same as the last price of the previous day. The money industry association's interbank lending rate rose by one point, with a listed rate of twenty-one cents, it is said.

### Securities, Covering Shorts and Going Long Arise Simultaneously, Domestic Debt Rises Sharply by More Than Two Yuan, Class C Breaks Through the Seven Yuan Mark, Market Sentiment is Excited, Rare in Recent Months

Yesterday's unofficial securities market opened up by more than one yuan in the morning, and then rose sharply by more than one yuan in the afternoon. The public debt market suddenly became lively, with covering shorts and going long arising simultaneously. Class C bonds had broken through the seven yuan mark and were gradually moving forward, which was rarely seen in the past two months. In the past, the rumors that were often decided were extinguished in an instant, but this decision was not the case. The market's morale reversed the previous state of depression and gradually became excited. The prospects at the moment, with Class C bonds as the standard, the initial target is fifty yuan to fifty-five yuan, which is naturally expected. Yesterday's experience, the opening was good by more than one yuan, and the opening price of Class C bonds was forty-six yuan, and then one or two cents higher. Later, due to some bulls selling off, it fell slightly to five yuan and five cents, but it was still good by more than one yuan before noon. In the afternoon, good news continued to come, and the market price rebounded again, with Class C bonds reaching forty-seven yuan and five cents. The closing market was quite like a spring cloud suddenly unfolding. As for the lineups of the buying and selling parties, it seemed that the various groups had shifted their direction and focused on public debt because foreign exchange, Shanghai red, and spot goods had no possibility of going long. It is permissible to say that the investment of small financial enterprises was the most enthusiastic, because there was also talk of a large American loan at the same time, and it was not difficult to turn from theory into reality. The transaction volume yesterday was about three million yuan, and the prices all rose by two yuan, one and a half cents to two yuan and four and a half cents. Ninety-six also suddenly rose to six yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading, 100 shares of China Merchants Electric Power shares were traded, with a price of five yuan and three cents.

Also, the Public Industry Association reported that yesterday's market situation was firm, and the transaction volume was moderate. A new transaction began in the afternoon, and the trend was even more pronounced. Steel stocks were still in a good situation, and a high price of nine yuan and one and a half cents was once seen. At the close, buyers were at eight yuan and nine and a half cents. There was demand for the electric power company's preferred shares at a price of one hundred and twenty-four yuan and a half, but they were not easy to buy. Its bonds were very attainable at seventy-eight yuan and two and a half cents, and the interest earned by those who purchased at this price was equivalent to a little over seven percent, while the preferred shares were less than seven percent. According to actual circumstances, the bonds are securities for which the company has a preferential repayment obligation, and now, according to the actual situation, the profits they generate are actually better than stocks, which is truly an unthinkable matter.

London, 20th telegram: The listed prices of various Far East British company stocks today have not yet been fully opened, and the market is stable with no changes.

London, 20th telegram: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt today continued to open for a type of Sino-French US dollar (with seal), with a price of thirty-eight pounds, a decrease of four pounds compared to the end of last month. The remaining items, such as the rehabilitation Crisp British and French debts, etc., still opened at the original prices, and the rest had not yet been opened.

### Yarn and Cotton, Yarn Sales Remain Sluggish, Double Horse Falls Again by Twenty-Five Yuan

The yarn market continues to be sluggish, the situation is still weak, and the downtrend is slightly slow, but spot sales remain sluggish, the Hong Kong dollar's absorption capacity is also stagnant, morale is softening, and foreign exchange is lengthening, and gold is declining. There are few buyers, and the market is becoming more and more scattered and weak. The amount of absorption by the general strength is always unwilling to give up. It is said that they still do not lack absorption and increase their positions when they see low prices. There is also a saying that because it has fallen back more than 130 yuan from its peak, if there is no unexpected blow, it may be temporarily fixed.

The morning opening was not popular, there were more sellers in the market, and the single price of 20-count Double Horse old warehouse for the period was 700 yuan, which immediately dropped to 690 yuan. There were few spot transactions, and it fell by 20 yuan, to 740 yuan. Then, as gold fell, foreign exchange loosened, and morale was particularly weak, it fell another 10 yuan. The intermittent fluctuations have been going on for a long time. By the time of the close, it had risen by about 10 yuan again. According to the statistics of the half-day turnover, 955 bales were traded. The prices of 20-count Double Horse fell by 25 yuan, Tiannv fell by 13 yuan, and Shepherd fell by 7.5 yuan. Today, 20 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, 60 pieces were shipped to Saigon, and 60 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of each gang's purchase is as follows:

White Cotton Trading is Lively

Spot cotton trading is still lively. The British firm Unified Chongxin Erchang bought 1,000 bales of white Luo cotton, and the price was very high. The business of white cotton continues to develop. These transactions are mostly purchased by cotton merchants first and then transferred to the factory. The source from northern Jiangsu has slightly decreased. 3,300 to 3,400 bales of Tong cotton have arrived at the wharf, and the opening price is similar to the previous day. 1,200 to 1,300 bales of Changyinsha cotton have also arrived, and 630 bales of Beisha cotton have arrived. The details of the spot cotton sales are listed below.

Another report is that the foreign cotton trading in Shanghai is due to the numerous rumors arising from all sides, and people's hearts are therefore unusually disturbed, and they all intend to temporarily hold a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, transactions from all parties are very few. Peers continue to be optimistic, so they are temporarily unwilling to sell. Yesterday, only Chongxin Factory purchased several hundred bales of White Luo cotton, and the factory price was 173 or 4 yuan per bundle.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices, The New York cotton market was firm at the beginning of the morning. Due to the purchase of speculators, the price of cotton rose by 5 or 6 pounds. Later, due to the strong sales of domestic cloth, the factory's demand for cotton turned active, and there has been a turnaround in Far East trade, and some shorts have been covered. All the way to the close, the price rose sharply by more than 10 pounds compared to the previous day. The price of Indian cotton has also rebounded, with both spot and futures rising by 4 rupees, Egyptian cotton rose by 6 or 7 pounds, and Liverpool rose by 3 pence.

### Grain, Eagerness to Sell Increases, Rice Prices Fall Sharply, Special Regular Grain is Thirty-Nine Yuan

Du rice and He rice arrived in Songjiang and Nangang in a total of fifteen ships. Cartwheel dumplings continued to arrive with more than 6,000 packages of new goods from Su Kun Jiaxing Jiashan and other places. Moreover, the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and the Hakka family is eager to sell their goods. At the same time, the sales market is exactly the opposite, so the market saw a downtrend at the opening of the early market. Afterwards, it fell more and more severely, and both japonica and indica rice fell by more than one yuan. It was at this time that the shops on the street were aroused, and the situation gradually became active, and the market turned stable. As a result, the price of special regular japonica rice was 39 yuan, special tin rice was 37 yuan, high quality was 35 or 6 yuan, medium quality was 33 yuan, Su Tong Kun japonica was 31 yuan, He Xia early and late rice was 29 yuan, original package was 32 or 3 yuan, Kun Zhuan Zhoupu new japonica was 26 or 7 yuan, Kunshan fragrant japonica was 38 yuan, Su Kun Jiaxing Jiashan new sheep pointed indica was 24 yuan to 22.5 yuan, Lingbai pointed indica was 25 yuan, Lu pointed indica was 23 yuan, Hu pointed indica was 21 yuan, Tuan pointed indica was 23.5 yuan to 23 yuan, Jiangbei new pointed indica was 23.5 yuan to 23 yuan, Wuhu high new pointed indica was 24 yuan, municipal was 23.5 yuan, secondary was 21 or 2 yuan, Bian yuan was 22 or 3 yuan, Hong Kong glutinous rice was 33 yuan, and the total transaction volume was more than 7,000 packages.

Ke Xian, The market opened softly yesterday morning, due to sufficient inventory and an endless supply. People's hearts have already been softened, and there were widespread rumors in the market that Japanese trading houses had dumped a large amount of new Wuhu Ke Xian rice, with prices only at twenty-one or two yuan. Therefore, people's hearts softened suddenly, and the market fell sharply. Traders and hoarders unanimously sought to sell, and although buyers had an appetite, they also intended to hold back and wait for a lower price. The price fell by two yuan, three, five cents to three yuan. Jiangbei new Xian high quality was twenty-three yuan and a half, medium quality was twenty-two or three yuan, Wuhu Xian ranged from twenty-four yuan to twenty-one yuan and a half. However, after the price fell, shop sales turned active, and the market turned stable again.

### Northern and Southern Ocean Groups Buy Flour in Large Numbers

Flour, The flour market had been tired for days but slightly recovered yesterday. The factory price of No. 2 flour still stands at seven yuan in cash, and the Huilong goods have shown some improvement, because the customer routes are more active. Hong Kong, Xiamen, Singapore and other places continued to add to their purchases, and the removal of Tianjin gangs has also increased. Therefore, people's hearts are slightly better, and the market has a firm bearing. The old warehouse's single price opened at seven yuan a little, and the new warehouse's single price was comparable to the factory price. The total transaction volume was more than 30,000 packages. There was not much trading in Kaiyang flour, and the price was at seven yuan and six or seven cents, and the market price also lacked special features.

Wheat, Yesterday, the wheat market was particularly dull, and the supply was endless. Although the factory appetite was moving, it was not smooth, and the traders and hoarders had long been watching and not moving forward. Japanese firms also only had retail sales and slightly traded, and the buyers suppressed the price very severely, and the market lacked excitement. The total market only saw domestic households purchasing three carts of Guandian wheat, and the Fuxin factory imported 8,000 packages of Su, Xi, Kun, Chang, Zhen, and Yang wheat, and the price was lackluster.

### Coal, Large Quantities of Wenzhou Charcoal Arrive in Shanghai

Wenzhou charcoal has been out of stock for some time, and due to the thin inventory in this port, market prices have soared, forming a situation where there are prices but no market, and people are panicked. Street customers have the ability to absorb, and recently the Shenyou Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou, loaded with a large quantity of Wenzhou grade A charcoal, estimated at more than 4,000 dan, which was sold by the manager of the Gongji Charcoal Company. It is said that the internal price was only seven yuan and five cents per dan, and the commission rate required a two yuan market premium.

### Sugar Market, Sugar Prices Slightly Flat

Yesterday the sugar market was stable. The guild's listed price for group 24 white Ben warehouse was fifty-four yuan and three cents, slightly less than two cents. The foreign warehouse was still fifty-four yuan, and the transit goods were two yuan less, at forty-five yuan. There was not much change in the Taikoo car white sugar.

The local No. 1 crystal was one yuan less, at sixty-five yuan, and the Jingming crystal was sixty-six yuan and a half. The Guotang's listed price was maintained and there was still no transaction, but since the foreign sugar has already fallen, although the national sugar has little inventory, there may be a possibility of loosening.

Couple's Knowledge

### The Joys and Sorrows of Couples During the Mid-Autumn Festival

(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road (Hours) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Closed on Sundays

The crescent moon shines on the nine continents, some families are happy and some are sad. Some couples share the same bed, while others are scattered abroad.

The Mid-Autumn Festival is a reunion festival. For lovers who are separated – especially women in their boudoirs – when the flowers are in full bloom and the moon is round, and the nights are beautiful, their hatred of separation will inevitably increase, and their feelings of "gazing at the moon and thinking secretly" will be greatly aroused! Therefore, husbands who have lovers often travel thousands of miles to be with them, so that they can pour out their accumulated feelings and spend this festive season together. This is also the duty of a husband to understand his wife's needs. In this way, won't the love and joy of continuing the relationship increase due to separation? Indeed, when men are healthy and women are beautiful, joy is born from separation. This is like a long drought meeting sweet rain, which not only benefits the body and mind, but also builds a solid foundation for the relationship between husband and wife. As a result, husband and wife follow each other, and they can't bear to be separated in the future. They give birth to sons and daughters and organize a happy family. How happy is that! But there are also many couples who are always together, and they should be reunited and happy. However, tragedies such as sleeping in the same bed with different dreams, being together in appearance but separated in heart, or even having affairs with others and eloping, or even openly suing the husband for divorce, constantly play out. Is this not a tragedy born of separation from union!

The joys and sorrows of couples are so changeable. According to medical theories, the key lies in whether the performance is healthy. If a man is full of energy and his desire for love is strong, who would be willing to leave his charming wife? Even if he is forced by the environment, he will always look for opportunities to reunite, especially during this festive season! Conversely, if a man has committed self-masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been indulging in sex early in marriage, and has exhausted the reproductive gland fluid that governs the health of his performance, then symptoms such as kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, premature aging, neurasthenia, and prolonged infertility will occur. This kind of sick husband, even if he has a beautiful wife like a flower, will inevitably show weakness and incompetence in his love life, or even be completely unable to perform. How can this not cause his wife to be annoyed, and the feelings become icy, and the cause of the couple's tragedy is mostly due to this.

If you know you are sick, men should make treatment plans early to avoid falling into a tragic fate! According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the most effective treatment is to take the "Reproductive Gland Element" lysate, "Reproductin." This agent is copied from the reproductive glands extracted from strong animals such as apes, gorillas, and sea dogs using scientific methods, so it is of high quality and has great supplementing power. After taking it, it can produce sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, and nourish the nerves in one day and night. Continued use can also help development and adjust metabolism. It can definitely cure various symptoms radically in a short period of time. Regular use in autumn and winter can prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those who have nocturnal emission must also take "Hemet's Sperm-Solidifying Tablets" (available at Wing On Guangshi Pharmacy Department and Wuzhou Chinese and Western Pharmacies) to consolidate the sperm barrier and stop ulceration. Then, treating both the symptoms and the root cause will have a more rapid effect!

### The Necessity of Prompt Treatment for Nocturnal Emission in Young Men

— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nian-zeng

In today's society, characterized by licentiousness and a lack of sex education, the high number of young people who engage in masturbation and suffer from nocturnal emission is a serious hidden concern for the nation's health and future! According to an on-the-ground survey and statistics from a certain sexually transmitted disease expert, it is known that young people who develop the bad habit of masturbation during puberty account for more than 90 percent.  Among those who develop nocturnal emission after puberty, the number also accounts for more than 80 percent.

Why does nocturnal emission occur? According to medical analysis, it is mostly due to masturbation and indulgence, early marriage and licentiousness, which damage the sexual nerves and weaken the control function of the seminal vesicle. Thus, even when stimulated by sexual sensations, seminal fluid can be discharged. When the symptoms worsen, seminal fluid can be discharged even without sexual stimulation, which is what is known as spermatorrhea or seminal leakage.

Seminal fluid is the source of our life. In addition to its role in reproduction, it can also directly penetrate the bloodstream through glandular organs and circulate throughout the body. Its functions include promoting development, regulating metabolism, nourishing the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves, and increasing the body's resistance to disease. Therefore, those who suffer from nocturnal emission and delay treatment, resulting in seminal depletion and blood exhaustion, will successively experience symptoms such as brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, lower back pain, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and premature aging. Such young people, plagued by illness, will have their academic and professional prospects completely destroyed. Even the essential marital life will be devoid of happiness, and they may even die young! Nocturnal emission should be treated as early as possible, as we have repeatedly stated, because early treatment minimizes the loss of vital energy and makes it easier to cure. However, regardless of how recent or long-standing, mild or severe the nocturnal emission is, according to renowned Chinese and foreign doctors and my experience, taking "Hymetol Spermatonic Pills" is the most effective and targeted treatment. This medicine can strengthen the seminal vesicle, calm the nerves, and provide the real effects of inducing sleep and stopping nocturnal emission after taking it. If the aforementioned symptoms have already occurred due to nocturnal emission, it is necessary to also take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Gonadotrophin" to fundamentally nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continued use can also promote development and regulate metabolism, inevitably curing all symptoms in a short period of time. Middle-aged and elderly people can also take it regularly to prolong life and rejuvenate.

Patient Mr. Zhang Guangyuan suffered from nocturnal emission for several years, resulting in extreme deficiency. He could not think during the day and could not sleep at night. He had never had children after marriage, and the relationship with his wife was as cold as ice. During the summer vacation, he sought my diagnosis and treatment. In addition to instructing him to purchase "Hymetol Spermatonic Pills" and "Gonadotrophin" at the Wuzhou Pharmacy for both symptomatic and fundamental treatment, I also administered new methods such as electrotherapy and injections. After a month, he has recovered his energy and is enjoying health and happiness again!

### From the Reunion of People and the Moon to the Importance of Breast Development!

— Doctor of Medicine Yao Chongpei, USA

Time flies, and it is once again the Mid-Autumn season with its refreshing autumn breeze and glistening dewdrops. Every time this season arrives, people, especially young and beauty-loving ladies, are all smiles and engage in major activities. This is because the heatwave has subsided and the severe cold has not yet arrived, making them feel relaxed and comfortable physically. And since the season is approaching Mid-Autumn, they eagerly purchase cosmetics, add new clothes, and put on heavy makeup to show off their slender figures in the clear autumn light. As for us men with beards, we naturally also need to buy some mooncakes, wine, and fruits to prepare for a family reunion with our wives and children in one room on Mid-Autumn Day, celebrating the "Reunion of People and the Moon."

"Reunion of People and the Moon"—what a happy environment! However, in this turbulent society, and especially in today's era where aesthetic values differ greatly from the past, many women, due to poor physical development, such as atrophied breasts, emaciated buttocks, withered muscles… are disliked or abandoned by men, and suffer the pain of the world! They are left alone in empty rooms, lonely on cold quilts. Although the festive season is upon them, it only serves to increase their pain. How can they find any joy? To seek remedy, they can only actively take the female "Gonadotrophin," a preparation made from ovarian extracts, which is the most accurate and reliable. The main cause of atrophied breasts is that ovarian function is impaired by menstrual irregularities, vaginal discharge, malnutrition, multiple births and weakness, anemia, and fatigue, which affects metabolism. Therefore, at this time, if they take the best-formulated ovarian endocrine preparation, female "Gonadotrophin," which has been sold for the longest time, they will be able to cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, making their breasts stand tall, their buttocks plump, and their muscles full and smooth. Continued use can also regulate menstruation, improve fertility, strengthen the body, preserve youth, enhance the love between husband and wife, create a happy and eternal beautiful family, and bring endless happiness.

### The Situation in Western Shanghai Remains Serious. The Municipal Council Strengthens Police Force. The Rumor of Abandoning Police Power Is Completely Baseless. Negotiations Between Both Sides Continue. Fake Police Illegally Occupy Posts in the Caoyang Road Area Again Yesterday.

A senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department said that in order to prevent rioters from attacking the Concession police again, the Municipal Council has strengthened the defenses in the western Shanghai area. This statement is to refute the absurd report of the "Xin Shenbao." According to the report yesterday, the traffic police of the Municipal Council who were responsible for the roads built beyond the boundaries of the Concession in western Shanghai have been withdrawn, which is the first step of the Concession authorities to hand over the police power of the area. It is said that although some of the traffic police in the area have left their original posts, they have all joined the patrol team to strengthen the police force. In the past week, seven police officers have had their firearms seized by armed rioters three times in the roads built beyond the boundaries of the Concession. After obtaining the firearms, these rioters all escaped into the area controlled by the pseudo-"Municipal Government." The first incident occurred on the evening of the 15th in the smoking and gambling area of ​​the Great Western Road. There were 15 plainclothes rioters carrying Mauser guns, who robbed three handguns from the Chinese police. While the police department was investigating the case, on the evening of the 16th, two more Chinese police officers had their firearms seized by rioters near Yidingpan Road and Bailinan Road. On the evening of the 20th, two more Indian police officers were attacked in the same way. They were surrounded by 12 rioters carrying weapons and wearing Chinese clothing, who robbed their firearms. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department not only does not want to withdraw from the roads built beyond the boundaries of the Concession in the western district, but also intends to transfer police officers from other police stations within the boundary to continue strengthening the defenses in western Shanghai.

Negotiations Between Both Sides Continue

The Anlin News reported that the authorities are still silent on the entire issue of the western district. However, the reporter learned yesterday (the 20th) that the negotiations between the Municipal Council and the Shanghai "Special Municipal Government" on the roads beyond the boundaries of the Concession in western Shanghai are still in progress. The protracted nature of the discussions does not imply that it has reached a deadlock. The consular body and the various defense forces of Shanghai are also involved in these consultations. On the 9th of this month, the police of the "Municipal Government" and a team of Japanese military police set up machine gun nests at No. 13 Great Western Road, opposite Avenue Haig. Negotiations then began.

More Fake Police on Roads Beyond Boundaries. Fake Police Occupy Police Posts

Afterwards, sandbag bunkers were also set up between Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai Road, and Difeng Road. Along the general roads in the western district, sentry posts were stationed everywhere. The police department still patrols the roads beyond the boundaries within the British and Italian military defense zones. However, more and more "Municipal Government Police" infiltrated the Concession roads and their vicinity yesterday. "The number of armed police in the area" cannot be accurately estimated.

In the Caoyang Road and Wujiaochang area (that is, five locations including Great Western Road Bailinan Road, Robert Sun Road, Bailinan Road South Road, and Rear Road), the police posts stationed by the Concession police were all illegally occupied by fake police yesterday. For example: (1) in front of Dingshun Sauce Garden at the intersection of Great Western Road and Connaught Road, (2) in front of the Tiandetang Pharmacy at the intersection of Bailinan Road and Great Western Road, (3) in front of the Tianle Theater at the intersection of Robert Sun Road and Great Western Road, (4) in front of Dingsheng Rice Store on Bailinan Road South Road. The original police officers are still stationed nearby, and the number of people in each location has increased compared to before (ranging from four to six people). Armored vehicles from the police department are also patrolling back and forth, and the situation is tense.

Openly Armed, Patrolling Back and Forth

There is no major change in the fake police stationed at the 21st shelter of the Cilian Branch at No. 11 Great Western Road. However, the internal installation of water and electricity projects is being rushed, and they are very busy. The kitchen set up in the front has also been completed and has started cooking their own meals since yesterday. There are still two fake police stationed in front of the Yisheng Kangji Wood Shop next to Qiuyuan at No. 15. The defensive situation of the fake police at the intersection of Kangjiaqiao Jinjiaxiang and in front of the gate of the fake police sub-bureau on Malu Bridge is still the same as before. However, since yesterday, armed fake police have been riding in several military trucks, holding guns, and standing around the vehicles in a posture of aiming and shooting, patrolling back and forth. Passers-by were hesitant and looked sideways.

Yuyuan Road Has Changed Its Old Look

There is no change in the fake police stationed at the entrance of Qianjia Lane opposite Siming Villa, Zhongshi New Village, and Yuguang Village on Yuyuan Road, and at the gate of the Toyota Spinning Factory workers' dormitory at No. 1249. As for No. 909 Lizhao Fang (that is, the Xingye Bank Real Estate), after being occupied by Japanese and fake police at 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, four fake police were sent to guard it until 11:00 p.m. when they were withdrawn. Yesterday morning, fake police were sent to station there again. At about 2:00 p.m., the fake police were transferred to other places. At the corner of Difeng Road, six fake police suddenly set up posts in three groups at the intersection yesterday morning. The police department also sent six police officers to drive to the scene and stationed next to the fake police. It is found that Yuyuan Road from Haig Road to Zhaofeng Park is full of fake police, and it no longer looks like it did in the past.

Trucks for Troop Transfer Are Non-Stop Day and Night

Yesterday, there were no special actions by the fake police at the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank staff dormitory at No. 1760 Jing'an Temple Road. The fake police stationed in Wangjia Lane (next to the White House Funeral Home) on the Great West Road have not been withdrawn. Yesterday, two fake police officers were stationed at Zaizha Lane, opposite No. 72. Yesterday, one fake police officer was directing traffic at the Columbia Road intersection. However, the police department still sent one Chinese police officer to monitor nearby, and there were also two Chinese police officers stationed on the sidewalk on the opposite side of the road. There are still two fake police officers carrying guns guarding the east and west ends of Fahua Bridge. As for the Anhe Temple Road area, it is an important road for the fake police to transfer troops. Most of the fake police are stationed at the old site of the Qianzhengshi Middle School in Fahua West Town. Therefore, the trucks of Japanese military police and fake police transferring troops back and forth are non-stop day and night, but there are no other actions.

Border Area Precautions Were Stricter Yesterday

The situation of the fake police stationed at Lin's Mansion, No. 448 Haig Road, is the same as the day before yesterday. However, when the reporter went to inspect yesterday, he saw women and children entering and leaving frequently, or they were family members of the fake police. Yesterday, at the Yidingpan Road intersection, six fake police officers, two in a row, formed a triangular station in the center of the road and at the corner. Both Concession police departments sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, totaling more than 20 people, to defend the area, and there was one armored vehicle aimed at the fake police station, checking pedestrians and vehicles very closely, and the situation was very serious. The number of police officers at the intersection of Xujiahui Xihui Road was also increased yesterday, and the situation was still good.

The Authorities Have Not Abandoned Police Power

Yesterday, the Fang Daily newspaper reported that since the morning of the 20th, the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station had automatically withdrawn the police posts from eight locations: (1) Great West Road Columbia Road, (2) Kaina Road Great Western Road, (3) Kaina Road Yidingpan Road, (4) Yidingpan Road Bailinan Road, (5) Caoyang Road, commonly known as Wujiaochang, (6) Great Western Road Bailinan Road, (7) Great Western Road Robert Sun Road, (8) Great Western Road Connaught Road. However, according to the reporter's knowledge, the Municipal Council has not only not abandoned the exercise of police power in the above-mentioned locations, but also sent more Chinese and Western detectives to each location to strengthen the police force and monitor the actions of the fake police. However, in order to ease the situation due to the police power issue being under negotiation, no armed intervention has been taken against the actions of the fake police supported by the Japanese side.

Various Things Said by the Fake "Mayor"

The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (the 20th), the "Shanghai City Fear" Chuan Xiao'an claimed that he and the French Consul General in Shanghai, Baudoin, had conducted informal discussions on "various issues of mutual interest." He also had preliminary informal discussions with Philip, the General Manager of the Municipal Council, on the issue of the roads beyond the boundaries of the Public Concession, but no comprehensive plan was agreed upon to solve the problem.

Saying That the French Consul General Expressed Cooperation

The exact scope of his discussions with Baudoin is difficult to explain, but the issues involved are quite broad, and the talks were conducted in a very friendly atmosphere. If necessary, he will meet with Baudoin again when he deems it appropriate. Baudoin has expressed a genuine spirit of cooperation and a willingness to hold friendly discussions. It is too early to disclose any progress he and Baudoin have made in negotiating the status of the Special Second Court. However, he is quite pleased with the progress of "these negotiations."

Meeting with Philip Twice

So far, the two discussions with Philip, the General Manager of the Municipal Council, have been of an informal nature. Neither side has put forward concrete proposals to solve the problem of the roads beyond the boundaries of the Concession. It is only an informal exchange of views. Mr. Philip originally submitted the matter to the foreign consular authorities. The "Shanghai Municipal Government" will wait for a reply and then continue to discuss the matter.

### The Rumors of Peace in Shanghai Are Not Credible. There Is Room for Negotiation Only After the Japanese Withdraw Their Troops First. The National Government Is Now Deploying Counter-Attacks on All Fronts. The Japanese Side Also Denies That Konoe Has Gone to Hanoi.

Recently, the international situation has been unpredictable. Since Germany and the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of non-aggression, followed by the Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement on the Mongolian border, rumors have sprung up in the market. It is known that most of these rumors cannot be proven. However, the result is only to give speculators an opportunity. For example, the saying that Soong Tzu-wen flew to the Soviet Union has been denied by the Chongqing side. Yesterday, it was also rumored that former Prime Minister Konoe of Japan had gone to the Southwest to seek peace between China and Japan with the Chongqing authorities. This saying is even more abrupt. The National Government insists on a long-term war of resistance. Peace can only be talked about if the Japanese withdraw their troops. Moreover, according to what has been heard from various sources, the Chinese government is now deploying counter-attack troops on all fronts. In the near future, the wars on all fronts will become more fierce.

Konoe Is in Japan, Not in Hanoi

Since this week, there have been many rumors about peace in the Far East. Some even said that former Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe has gone to Hanoi and is taking a route to Kunming to negotiate peace with the Chinese authorities. Last night, foreign reporters asked about this at the Japanese news briefing. The Japanese spokesman denied this firmly, saying that Konoe is now in Tokyo, and even if he is not in Tokyo, he is only in a certain place in Japan.

Military Personnel Advocate for a Five-Power Alliance

The English-language Great American Evening News reported that today (the 21st), according to unofficial Japanese sources in this port, yesterday (the 20th) it was rumored that the Japanese side was managing the Soviet-German-Italian-Japanese-Chinese five-power alliance. Although the Shanghai Japanese spokesman expressed some doubts last night, today, the military personnel in Tokyo who advocate this alliance believe that the plan to realize a radical change in policy has gained momentum. Unofficial Japanese sources in this port insisted that the movement for a five-power alliance has begun, and it is pointed out that Admiral Nomura, who served as the commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy during the Shanghai War in 1932, is the most likely to succeed Abe as the Foreign Minister, who is also the Prime Minister of Japan. When the proposed five-power alliance is implemented, the Japanese Navy will occupy an important position. Excluding British and French forces from the Far East will mostly depend on the actions of the Japanese Navy.

Japanese Spokesman Expressed Doubt

The Continental News reported that at the Japanese reception for news reporters last night (the 20th), the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy's reaction to the English-language Great American Evening News' yesterday's publication of "The influential Japanese political circles are now actively managing the Soviet-German-Italian-Japanese-Chinese five-power alliance in order to exclude the British from the East" was "completely baffled." After reading the message, the spokesman said that he himself was confused and quite doubted the correctness of the "unofficial Japanese sources in this port." Even in Japan, opinions are not all the same. Therefore, one person's remarks cannot represent the opinions of the entire Japanese people.

Japan Is Unwilling to Be Involved in the European War

As Japanese Prime Minister Konoe announced, Japan's policy is not to be involved in the European War. The Japanese government also adheres to this policy and is unlikely to take any steps contrary to this policy. The spokesman replied to an intermittent question, saying that the Japanese government does not want to establish any connection between the Chinese "incident" and the European War. Japan intends to concentrate its efforts to solve the China problem. However, this does not mean that it will establish any contact with other countries to make these efforts. Japan is determined to solve the China problem on its own.

The Japanese Army Took Over the Defense of the Jia District of Suzhou River This Morning, Restoring the Original Situation Before the August 13th Battle, and the Weihui Patrol Station Exercised Police Power

###

Before "August 13th," the Jia District of Suzhou River (between North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road) originally belonged to the Japanese Navy Marine Corps defense area. After the war, the British army took over the defense. By June of this year, the Japanese side proposed negotiations to the British army. On September 11, the two sides reached an agreement stipulating that from the morning of September 22, the original situation before the war would be restored. The area would still be patrolled by the Japanese Navy and Marine Corps. It is now learned that since last night, the British army stationed in the area has begun to transfer the defense. As for the patrol station that exercises police power, before the war, the area west of North Henan Road was under the jurisdiction of the Weisi patrol station, and the area east of North Henan Road was under the jurisdiction of the Weishan patrol station. However, since the war, the area east of North Jiangxi Road has been cut off by barbed wire and isolated from the Japanese military defense area. The section west of North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road has been changed to be under the jurisdiction of the Weisi patrol station. Now that the defense area has been restored to its original state, the police power of the area will also be exercised by the Weishan patrol station from today.

People Are Calm and Do Not Relocate

After the saying that the British army defense area in Suzhou River will have a historical change occurred, many residents in Hebei heard the news and relocated. Now, since the change of area is limited to a small section extending from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road, the relocation trend among those living west of North Henan Road has stopped. Even those living in the extended area are gradually becoming calm because there is no need for a pass after the change of the British and Japanese defense areas, and there is no barbed wire in form.

Yesterday's Situation Was the Same as Usual

The situation in the area west of North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road yesterday was the same as usual, and pedestrians were also very busy. A British soldier was still guarding west of the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Hainin Road. The British military defense situation at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu Road was also no different from usual. A British soldier was also stationed at the intersection of North Henan Road and Bazilu Road. Traffic on that road to the Concession Road was also unobstructed as usual.

### The Original Shanghai-Oujiang Line Foreign Ships Are Waiting for the Opportunity to Resume Navigation.

However, Yonglong Has Changed to Hong Kong, and Shenyou Is Still Docked at the Mouth of Oujiang River.

The Shanghai-Oujiang line, which has been suspended for nearly half a year, was successfully tested by foreign merchant ships Xinxiangtai, Xin'antong, Xin'anli, Shenfu, and Shen'ai in early September. It is expected that each ship will be able to navigate temporarily afterwards. Therefore,

Yilong Company added Shenyou to the voyage, and Yonglong also planned to participate in the voyage. Unexpectedly, on the 16th, the Japanese side once again clamored that it would close the mouth of Wenzhou again from the 17th. After receiving the news, the shipping companies were extremely panic. Yonglong Lun

stopped opening Wenzhou and changed to Hong Kong. Xinxiangtai and Shenai have returned to Shanghai. It is heard that Shenai is temporarily out of service for repairs, and Xinxiangtai is still waiting to see. If the environment permits, it still plans to sail to Wenzhou. According to news from Yilong Company yesterday, for the Japanese side to close the mouth of the Oujiang River again,

There is still no definitive news. Shenfu of the company has started loading goods in the mouth, but Shenyou has not yet entered the mouth. It is still waiting for the opportunity to enter the mouth. Shenhua, which went to Sandu'ao, returned to Shanghai today from there. Shenguang went out yesterday afternoon and also sailed to Sandu'ao.

### The Soviet Consulate Moved Back to Its Old Site.

The Relationship Between Japan and the Soviet Union Changed, and Officials Will Be Replaced.

The English-language Great American Evening News reported that, according to the announcement posted at the temporary office of the Soviet Union's Shanghai Consulate on Shanzhong Road, the Consulate General will return to the old building on Huangpu Road next Monday. Four low-level officials of the Soviet Consulate left Shanghai for Vladivostok yesterday (the 20th). People in this port believe that the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union has changed, and all officials of the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai will be replaced.

### It Is Rumored That the Vietnamese Government Will Requisition the Haiphong Warehouse, and Will Be Able to Requisition the Goods Stacked in the Warehouse at Any Time. The Chinese Authorities in Haiphong Discussed Remedial Measures, and Quickly Telegrammed the National Government to Negotiate an Exemption.

Datong News Agency reported that, according to unconfirmed news in the shipping industry, foreign postal ship companies in this city recently received a telegram from Haiphong, saying that the Vietnamese government has issued a mobilization order due to the situation, in addition to mobilizing troops, digging trenches all over the important streets, and implementing lighting control at night. The government authorities will also requisition all official and private warehouses for storing military supplies. Therefore, the goods accumulated in the warehouses may be requisitioned at any time if necessary. Haiphong

The Chinese Consul

believed that this matter was of great importance, so he specially invited Huang Qiang, the Central Government's transportation commissioner stationed in Haiphong, and Xi Chunli, the president of the Haiphong Chamber of Commerce, and various large merchants to the consulate to discuss remedial measures for this issue, and urgently telegraphed the Central Government to request that our ambassador to France

earnestly negotiate

for an exemption in order to protect the people's strength. It is found that due to the failure of smooth transportation in Haiphong, the goods accumulated in the past year are about 40,000 tons, worth 100 million yuan in national currency. If it is requisitioned by France, not only will the economy of our merchants be on the verge of collapse, but also the national tax revenue and people's livelihood will be damaged. The general merchants are

extremely anxious.

However, the failure of smooth transportation in Haiphong did not start today. Therefore, merchants with a long-term vision have already found a way to take the route through Saigon. Since Saigon has no accumulated goods and there are many vehicles, ships arriving in Saigon can unload and load goods ashore without storing them in warehouses, so it can definitely avoid the danger of goods being requisitioned due to warehouse congestion.

### Flat Rice Sale Price: 1,000 Bags at $1.40 per Dou
### Yesterday's Rice Price Fell Again, Fears of Instability Gradually Subsiding; Proposal to Reinstate the Rice Price Appraisal Committee

The five flat rice distribution points in the British and French Concessions, as well as the first flat distribution point, were abolished yesterday and merged into the second flat distribution point at the corner of Avenue Haig and Route Cardinal. Therefore, the amount of rice distributed at that location was increased from 200 bags to 300 bags yesterday. 150 of these bags were transported to the third flat rice distribution point at the Jade Buddha Temple on Rue Lou-lan. The flat rice at both locations was sold out by 2 PM yesterday. According to inquiries by a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, the regulations for the flat rice distribution at each location for today and tomorrow have been set as follows: (1) 250 bags per location on the 22nd; (2) 200 bags per location on the 23rd. The Sino-Italian Company's warehouse has been emptied. Starting yesterday, the tribute rice from the Fuxing Flour Mill warehouse on Yichang Road will be transported to the flat rice distribution points in preparation for distribution today.

According to news from the Rice Trade Association, the source of rice supply in the city has gradually become smoother recently, rice merchants have regained activity, and rice prices are expected to fall soon. According to an informal survey, there are currently at least 300,000 bags of rice in storage in the city. If the source of supply is unimpeded, it is possible to restore the situation from last spring. Recently, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and various rice shops have suggested to the authorities of the two concessions that they intend to request the reinstatement of the Rice Price Appraisal Committee and investigative work so that the food problem of the people can gradually return to normal. It is heard that the authorities of the two concessions are currently considering this.

Flat Rice Price

A reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited Zhang Nianxuan, Chairman of the Rice Trade Association, and Shi Hongxun, Director of the Second Flat Distribution Point, yesterday. According to both men, the five tribute rice flat distribution points in the two concessions have been operating for six days. Due to the "September 18th" anniversary, operations were suspended for one day during the period of alert, so in actuality it was only five days. Of the 8,000 bags of tribute rice, over 5,200 bags have already been sold, leaving over 2,700 bags of tribute rice, including 1,000 bags of flat rice. The first flat distribution has been decided to end on the 25th of this month. The agreed upon prices for the flat rice are: (1) $0.14 per Sheng; (2) $0.70 for five Sheng; (3) $1.40 per Dou. However, due to the hasty preparations for this decision on flat rice distribution, although strict arrangements were made at each location, the overcrowding of rice buyers resulted in civilians being knocked down. The second flat distribution must wait for a considerable amount of time before it can be decided.

Rice Prices Gradually Falling

The bean and rice market has recently seen rice from various producing areas such as Changshu, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou transported to Shanghai, which has made people less anxious. Furthermore, hoarders have disappeared, sales are sluggish, and prices for all goods on the market are declining. The market opened as usual at 9 AM yesterday, with an abundance of goods available. Prices fell again by two to three yuan compared to the previous day, and fears of instability are gradually subsiding. The reasons for this rice price decline are: (1) All large and small factories have participated in the joint group purchase of foreign rice; (2) Since the start of the five flat rice distribution points, civilians have been buying tribute rice at the flat distribution prices, and the business of various rice shops has become sluggish, with buyers in the market taking a wait-and-see approach; (3) The supply of domestic rice from various regions is increasing, and new rice will soon enter the market. As of yesterday, over 80 companies had registered for the joint group purchase of foreign rice, totaling over 14,000 bags of rice.

### Shanghai-Zhenhai Shipping News

Regarding the resumption of the Shanghai-Zhenhai shipping route by German merchant ships, after careful consideration by various companies, the Feikang轮 of the Lulin 洋行 made its first voyage to Zhenhai the night before last after the European war. It was reported by the shipowner yesterday morning that it had safely arrived at Qili Island outside the port of Zhenhai. The Hana轮 of the Far East Company sailed from Shanghai to Zhenhai at 5 PM yesterday. The Moufu轮 of the Lihe 洋行 will also sail to Zhenhai on a regular basis. The Haifu轮 will return to Shanghai after unloading its cargo in Zhenhai. In the future, the four German ships Feikang, Hana, Moufu, and Haifu will regularly sail the Shanghai-Zhenhai route. It is also learned that the Dapu轮 of the Norwegian merchant Hua Lun 洋行 will sail from Haiphong to Shanghai and also intends to join the sailing to Ningbo. Therefore, excluding the New Beijing, which has been reassigned to another route, there will be as many as twelve ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo route.

### Senior Soviet Official Leaves Shanghai for Japan, Confirmed by Spokesperson of Japanese Embassy, but Claims Ignorance of Their Purpose in Japan

The Continental Daily News reports that it was learned in Shanghai yesterday (20th) morning that a group of several senior Soviet officials recently left Shanghai for Japan on a Japanese ship. This news was confirmed yesterday afternoon by a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy. The spokesperson admitted that he did not know why the Soviet officials had left Shanghai for Japan, but claimed that they may be going to Japan for vacation or passing through Japan to return to the Soviet Union.

### Fresh Meat Industry in the French Concession on the Verge of Closure Due to Breakdown in Negotiations Over Increased Slaughter Fees; Meat Trade Association Issued Notice Yesterday to Suspend Purchases

Since the negotiations between the fresh meat industry in the city and the Hongkou "Livestock Market" came to a temporary end, and the meat industry resumed operations to safeguard social needs, the Slaughter Industry Association of the French Concession published a notice requesting the meat industry to resume the "cut-head" method implemented in 1929, starting from the 14th of this month. Subsequently, the Second Special District Branch of the Fresh Meat Trade Association published a newspaper on the 13th rejecting the request and continuing to operate as usual. After several rounds of negotiations, the opinions of both parties were too far apart, and there was no result.

The Meat Industry Firmly Rejects the "Cut-Head" Bad Habit

The practice of the fresh meat industry in the French Concession sending piglets to the slaughterhouse for slaughter, with a fee of $0.40 per pig as the standard, or $0.45 to $0.50 per pig due to distance, has been in place for many years without incident. However, the so-called "cut-head" method has many drawbacks. For example, the profits from cutting out parts such as organs are obtained by the slaughter industry. However, in previous years, when pork prices were low, the value of cutting out several internal organs was very small. Now that pork prices are high, if seven pieces are cut out (i.e., small intestines, tail end, heart-protecting oil, etc.), the value is $2.60 to $3.00, so the fresh pork industry cannot accept this "cut-head" method. There is also the issue of responsibility for dead pigs (i.e., the problem of pigs rendered for oil), which is also the main reason for this dispute. If the fresh meat industry sends pigs to the slaughterhouse and the piglets die in the slaughterhouse after one or two days due to disease, who should bear the loss? This is also the focus of contention between the two parties.

The French Authorities' Mediation Fails

On the 19th and 20th, the French Municipal Council, seeing the seriousness of the situation, summoned the responsible persons from both sides to the bureau to mediate the problem of pigs rendered for oil. However, the two sides insisted on their positions, and there was no result. The slaughter industry then raised the issue of increasing slaughter fees. The meat industry stated that it could increase the fee by up to 50% (i.e., increasing the slaughter fee from $0.40 to $0.60 per pig), but this was firmly rejected by the slaughter industry. After two days of mediation, a result that satisfied both parties was not obtained. As for the report in yesterday's newspaper that "the director of the Municipal Council summoned the parties for arbitration and ruled that the slaughter fee be increased to $1.50, and that an agreement be established on the 18th of this month," this has also not materialized. However, it is heard that a compromise has been agreed upon, which may be acceptable to both parties.

Most of the Meat Industry Closed Today

Since the breakdown in negotiations, the slaughter industry has implemented the "cut-head" method for three days. On the first two days, seven pieces were cut out, and on the third day, eight pieces were cut out. Although the meat industry strictly negotiated to stop this, it was ineffective, resulting in significant losses for the meat industry. Since yesterday, most of the meat industry in the French Concession has stopped sending pigs to the slaughterhouse for slaughter. The supply of fresh meat in the French Concession market has fallen into a state of closure today.

Meat Industry Notice: Do Not Cause Trouble

The Fresh Meat Trade Association of the French Concession issued a notice yesterday, advising its members to wait quietly for a solution and avoid causing trouble. The notice is recorded below: "Notice: According to reports from members of this association, the slaughterers have been illegally occupying some of the organs that should be handed over, as a way to extort increased slaughter fees. This has been going on for two days. On-site obstruction was attempted, but there was fear of causing a fight. After reporting to the police, no legal action was taken. Members are suffering losses and have been forced to temporarily suspend purchases. Regarding the increase in slaughter fees, the slaughter fees in the French Concession are already higher than in the Public Concession. After the slaughterers privately seized some of the organs, and after repeated mediation by the police authorities, members have indicated that they can increase the slaughter fees by up to 50%. However, the slaughterers have been firm in their stance and have refused to compromise, resulting in a failure to resolve the issue. The initial intention of the members to settle the matter peacefully should be clear to the relevant authorities. Therefore, this association urgently notifies the members who have temporarily suspended purchases to strictly maintain order, wait quietly for a solution, and avoid causing trouble, so as not to affect public safety. This notice."

### Mid-Autumn Festival Approaching, Various Industries Handling Account Settlements, Market Funds Abundant and Increasingly Active, but Speculative Transactions Becoming Increasingly Rampant

Account settlements in Shanghai are traditionally divided into three festivals: the Dragon Boat Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the end of the lunar year. As the Mid-Autumn Festival on September 27th is approaching, various businesses and companies have begun handling account settlements. For customer accounts that belong to Shanghai, lists have been distributed and personnel have been assigned to collect the debts. For accounts that belong to other cities, the Chamber of Commerce and other organizations have issued certificates and assigned personnel to collect the debts. Therefore, the money industry's collection and payment have become busy, the amount of exchanges in the clearing house has increased sharply, and the amount of new exchange transfers used by various banks and businesses has also increased. The Silver and Money Trade Association has decided to take a one-day holiday for the Mid-Autumn Festival in accordance with regulations.

Abundant Funds, Stable Interest Rates

Since the implementation of the new exchange transfer system in the Shanghai financial market, various banks and businesses have provided collateral and borrowed from the joint reserve of banks, which directly adjusts the bonuses of the silver and money industry and indirectly meets the needs of industry and commerce. In addition, the $12 million in exchange transfers deposited by various banks and businesses in the reserve treasury has been completely exchanged for legal tender by the central bank. Therefore, the market has increased exchange transfers and legal tender funds. At the same time, because funds that previously fled to Hong Kong have returned to Shanghai, the market funds are very abundant, and various industries are becoming increasingly active. The legitimate financial market remains stable, and the interbank lending rate has not fluctuated much.

Speculative Transactions Becoming Increasingly Rampant

After the fall of Shanghai, due to the lack of government authority, the general wealthy lack legitimate avenues for investment. Furthermore, the internal transfer of funds to develop the southwest cannot be fully utilized due to environmental factors. As a result, most of the funds are used for speculative activities, resulting in more frequent speculative transactions in the black market for foreign exchange, gold, securities, and goods than before the war. Recently, speculators have been arbitrarily spreading rumors in an attempt to make profits, causing violent fluctuations in the black markets for foreign exchange, gold, and securities. This situation is detrimental to the stability of the Shanghai financial market and is inconsistent with the government's financial policy. It is hoped that speculators will realize this.

International Exchange Center Remains Unchanged

A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the silver and money industry yesterday that although the center of trade and finance in Shanghai after the fall has shifted internally, the international exchange still takes Shanghai as its center, and transactions remain prosperous. However, due to traffic congestion and weak purchasing power of the people, it is not as prosperous as in the past. As for the various banks and businesses, they are doing their best to cope with the drastic changes and maintain the market in this difficult environment. In addition to focusing on maintaining strength, their future business strategy is to gradually divide their resources in the southwest.

Ministry of Finance Cracking Down on Black Market Foreign Exchange

Some Issue Foreign Exchange Certificates

According to sources in the financial community in Shanghai from Hong Kong and Chongqing, the National Government in Chongqing may issue foreign exchange certificates in the shortest possible time. Two months ago, when the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee stopped supplying foreign exchange to the black market in Shanghai, the chairman of the committee, Rogers, advocated issuing foreign exchange certificates, but this was not adopted by the Ministry of Finance. Recently, due to the situation, Rogers has been advocating his previous proposal more strongly. (Great Shanghai News Agency)

### Rampant Issuance of Substitute Coupons, Petty Thieves Taking the Opportunity to Profit; Counterfeiting and Imitation Rampant; Three-Time Offender of Counterfeiting Huaji Coupons Sentenced

In early July of this year, Jing'an Zhuzhan on Jing'an Temple Road, Dinghexiang in Caojiadu, Dehexiang in Macgregor Road, Shenghexiang in Ningbo, Taichangxiang in Tiantong Road, Yuqingfeng, Yongshengxiang, Xingonghe, and Xinshunji in Xujiahui, and other 14 tobacco and paper stores, jointly organized a substitute coupon for one and two Fen of the Huaji Company to be given to customers. They contracted with the Ruiwen Printing House on Touji Bridge in the Public Concession to print a total of

480,000

sheets, totaling $7,200, which will be the responsibility of the 14 stores to recover in the future. On the 3rd of this month, an informant named Ma Genfa went to Jing'an Zhuzhan on Jing'an Temple Road and reported to the manager Hua Junwei that counterfeit one- and two-Fen substitute coupons of the Huaji Company of your tobacco and paper industry were being used in the market. The printer of the counterfeit coupons was the Haining Printing House at 1008 Haining Road in the Public Concession. Hua Junwei reported the information, and the Huisi Police Station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the address, where they arrested

the owner of the printing house,

Yin Xigen, a native of Qingpu, and seized 24,000 one- and two-Fen substitute coupons of the Huaji Company that had already been printed, as well as several wooden molds. Yin confessed that the source was Peng Ruixiang, a native of Haimen who worked at the Huizhong Printing House at 7 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. The detectives then arrested Peng. According to Peng, the engraver was Wang Yichen, a native of Suzhou who lived in Caojiadu. Wang was subsequently arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng visited the Third Criminal Court for investigation and trial. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Police Station,

explained the process.

Then, the victim, Hua Junwei, and Shen, the representative of Ruiwen Printing House, testified to everything. When questioned, the three defendants pushed the blame on each other. Wang Yichen confessed that there was still a principal offender named Yu who was at large. The court instructed Li Zhishan, the representative of the Public Works Department, to begin the debate. Lawyer Li stated that the defendants in this case had counterfeited the Fen coins substitute coupons of the Huaji Company, and the informant had obtained the clues and reported them to the Police Station, who arrested the defendants and seized several zinc plates and 24,000 substitute coupons that had been printed. The defendants confessed to the crime and the evidence matched the circumstances of the crime. The evidence is very clear, and the defendants

should be held criminally liable

without any possibility of escape. However, the lower court is requested to impose a heavy sentence. In recent times, due to the lack of one- and five-Fen auxiliary coins in Shanghai, stamps were initially used as substitutes, but stamps are easily damaged and soiled, and are inconvenient to use. Larger companies in Shanghai, such as the Tram Company, the Public Bus Company, and major department stores, have issued their own Fen coins substitute coupons due to practical needs in order to facilitate transactions. The legal basis for their right to issue is still questionable. After all, the issuance of banknotes by banks is still subject to the approval of the government's Ministry of Finance. How can other commercial and circulating substitute coupons be an exception? After large companies issued substitute coupons, various small shops

followed suit.

Even pancake stalls, tiger stoves, and tofu vendors printed their own Fen coins substitute coupons, of all colors and shapes, numbering in the thousands. If a shop or company has strong capital and sufficient reserves, and issues a fixed amount of Fen coins substitute coupons due to practical needs, it is not entirely unreasonable. However, if the most unscrupulous shopkeeper prints hundreds or thousands of yuan worth of substitute coupons with a printing fee of a few yuan or dozens of yuan, it is truly a way to make money. Unscrupulous people see that there is a great profit to be made and intensify their efforts, counterfeiting and imitating, without end. The victims are the general public, and the most pitiful are those of that class. The result of the defendants' crimes has a great impact on the entire society. Please punish them severely to deter others from following their example. Judge Huang sentenced Wang Yichen to one year of imprisonment for forging private documents, and Peng Ruixiang and Yin Xigen to eight months of imprisonment for the same crime. The seized evidence was confiscated according to the list.

### Youth Grieves Parents' Tragic Death, Wishes to Die Together with Japanese, Pushes Two Japanese into Huangpu River, Then Jumps in Themselves; All Three Rescued, Youth Detained for Interrogation

The Continental Daily News reports that Feng Chu (transliteration), a local resident, pushed two Japanese into the Huangpu River yesterday (20th) afternoon on the Bund, and then jumped in himself. He was subsequently rescued and taken to the Central Police Station, where he was accused of attempted murder. Feng is currently unemployed and penniless. According to his statement to the Police Station, his father was bombed to death in Zhabei two years ago, so he harbors deep hatred for the Japanese. He saw two Japanese civilians standing near the 11th wharf on the Bund yesterday, and suddenly made the decision to take revenge. As the two Japanese were standing together, Feng unexpectedly pushed one of them violently into the water, and then the other Japanese. However, Feng's actions were very quick, and it took a while before someone raised the alarm. The patrolmen heard the news and immediately began the rescue, but it was necessary to summon a water police boat to pull the three struggling people out of the river. It was found that the two Japanese were standing on the wharf to view the scenery, and did not know Feng at all. Feng Zeyong, a Shanghai native, is 19 years old (because he was born in the twelfth month of the lunar calendar, he is actually not yet 18 years old). He used to live on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. His father was a printer by profession, and his family was well-off, so Feng received a family education from an early age. When the August 13th Shanghai Battle broke out, Feng's family initially did not escape in time. On August 18th, due to the bombing by Japanese planes, the family business was

destroyed by artillery fire.

They had no choice but to find a way to escape into the Concession. As they were about to reach the border of the Concession, they were again bombed by Japanese planes. As a result, Feng's parents were bombed to death, and even their corpses could not be found. Feng barely escaped with his life and managed to take refuge in the Concession. However, Feng's parents were dead, and he had no relatives. Although he tried to find a job to support himself, he has not been able to do so. Fortunately, he had $300 in legal tender with him when he escaped, which he used to maintain his life. However, because he only had expenses and no income, the meager funds were eventually

exhausted.

As the weather grew colder day by day, and he was unfamiliar with the people and the place, and had no relatives to turn to, his hardship was no different from hell. He then had the thought of seeking death. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at around 3:30 PM, he went alone to Wharf No. 11 on the Bund, intending to commit suicide in the river to end his miserable life. Unexpectedly, the owner of the Japanese merchant ship Liyang Maru, Japanese Matsuo Toshishi, and engineer Ogata Yoshihisa were also at the wharf at this time, intending to take a barge across the river to the Nisshin Wharf in Pudong, Feng's brain was filled with the tragic death of his father, thinking that his family had been harmonious and carefree, but had been bombed by Japanese planes, and his parents

died tragically

without a trace, and the family business was ruined as a result. All these tragic consequences were caused by the Japanese. He immediately had the thought of avenging his parents, and immediately pushed the two Japanese into the Huangpu River, and then jumped in himself, intending to die together with them. However, both Japanese were good swimmers, so they were spared from disaster. Feng was also rescued by the people on the wharf. Under the investigation of Kobayashi, a Japanese detective from the Central Police Station, Feng's actions constituted attempted murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code, and he was taken into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Lawyer Ru Bao-i of the Police Station explained the process and presented the court with the statement Feng made at the Police Station explaining the reason for plotting to harm the two Japanese,

a single statement.

Matsuo Toshishi and others then recounted the circumstances at the time. When questioned, Feng Zeyong recounted the previous events and stated that he did not know the two Japanese at all, and only learned that they were Japanese when he overheard their conversation while he was planning to commit suicide yesterday, and then he had the thought of avenging his parents. After Judge Feng Shide verified the statements, he instructed Feng to be detained temporarily and rescheduled the hearing for one week later.

The Morris Case Continued Yesterday

Two Witnesses Give Same Testimony

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that Judge Haines of the British Consular Court held a police court yesterday (21st) morning to continue the trial of Morris, an employee of the Public Works Department's Health Department, who was charged with negligent homicide. Two more eyewitnesses gave testimony. The first eyewitness, Huang San (transliteration), a Chinese, unemployed, testified that at 2:15 AM on the 8th of this month, he had lost a little money playing mahjong at a friend's house on Baker Road, and then went to a noodle shop a little further down the road to order some food. While he was eating noodles, he saw two foreigners and one Chinese come out of a brothel across the street. The owner of the brothel came out with them. The taller foreigner beat the owner of the brothel to the ground, and the three men left. The eyewitness saw this and ran out of the shop to report it to the police. On the way, he encountered a Japanese naval patrol, who asked him why he was running. The eyewitness told them what had happened, and the Japanese soldiers went to the scene, he said. Wei Yuxin (transliteration), the owner of the noodle shop, gave testimony consistent with that of the first eyewitness. Licks, the defendant's defense lawyer, requested an adjournment so that the eyewitnesses could be cross-examined. Judge Haines adjourned the court and rescheduled the hearing.

Two Morphine Dens Busted One After Another

A Total of Eight Male and Female Criminals Apprehended

The French Police Department received a tip at around 4 PM the day before yesterday that someone was running a morphine den at 184 Rue de Saigon, so it dispatched detectives Hua Guoxiang and others to the address. They apprehended three Korean men and women and two Chinese, Guo Zuxing and Xu Zhongshi, and seized more than 600 packets of morphine. All were taken to the Police Station. After interrogating them, they received another tip that someone was running such a den in a kiosk at 409 Route Pichon, so they dispatched the original detectives to the address, arrested two Koreans and one Chinese, Yun Fulin, and seized a large amount of morphine. All were arrested and sent to the court for investigation and prosecution.

### Middle School Students Brawl in Dormitory; Student surnamed Fang Seriously Injured; Intestines Ruptured, Life in Danger; Assailant Student Arrested and Awaiting Investigation

Zou Zhengzhi, a local youth residing at 144 Fenshan Road (a relative of a well-known person in the city), is 19 years old and studies at the private Shanghai Middle School at 460 Chengdu Road, where he is also the class leader of the senior year. He had disagreements with classmate Fang Yimou (the maternal uncle of a certain military commander from Sichuan). At 10:30 AM on the 20th, Zou and Fang suddenly clashed in the school dormitory over a minor matter, leading to a physical fight. After teachers arrived and dispersed them, Zou, still unwilling to let it go, gathered others and violently beat Fang Yimou, causing him severe injuries and leaving him groaning in bed. Zou, realizing the trouble he had caused, was arrested by Detective Wang Shidong and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the above situation, saying that the injured party, Fang Yimou, was found by the hospital to have suffered serious injuries, with ruptured intestines requiring surgery. Therefore, it is not yet known if his life is in danger. He requested permission for a postponement to summon Judge Xiang Zuxian for questioning. The order was given to detain him and postpone the hearing for seven days.

Hua Chung Bank West District Branch Grand Opening

A New Highlight for Finance in West Shanghai

In recent years, West Shanghai has seen a dense population and a thriving market. The area around Caojiadu and Yanping Road is particularly flourishing. However, there has been a lack of financial institutions. Hua Chung Bank is a leader in the local banking industry, having been established the earliest and possessing substantial capital. Manager Huang Yuqi, aware of this situation, specially selected the intersection of Connaught Road and Hart Road to build a new building and establish the West District Branch. It aims to adjust surpluses and deficits, providing financial services to all sectors of West Shanghai. The news spread, and everyone rejoiced. Yesterday (the 21st) was the opening day of the branch. Connaught Road and Hart Road were bustling with traffic, a grand occasion. This not only demonstrates the urgent need for financial institutions in West Shanghai but also reflects the bank's excellent service record over the past decade, which has garnered widespread praise. The details are recorded below:

The branch is located at the corner of Connaught Road and Hart Road, directly accessible by bus route 10 and very close to trolleybus route 24. The building is a modern 1940s-style bank. The decorations are luxurious and exquisite. On the opening day, over 500 prominent figures and leaders from all sectors of society, including Wen Lantin, Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Yu Zuoting, Ma Shaoquan, Jiang Yiping, Xue Dubi, Chen Ziyi, Lu Wenshao, Xu Guanqun, Zhu Hegao, Wei Jinsan, He Wuliang, Jin Zongcheng, Xi Yushu, Xu Xiaochu, Zhou Bangjun, Xia Xishi, Li Wenjie, Hu Chuqing, Wei Yiqing, Yuan Yang'an, Pan Xulun, Shen Jinyong, Wang Huailian, and Hu Guigeng, came to offer their congratulations. The number of cars and chartered vehicles stretched for hundreds of meters, making it a grand event. Manager Huang Yuqi and others of the bank were responsible for the reception. The Municipal Council also sent four armed police officers to maintain order. At 8:00 AM, Mr. Xu Jilao, a prominent figure in the financial community, held the flag-raising ceremony. Later, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Wu Yunqi, and Pei Yunqing personally presided over the opening ceremony and took commemorative photos. The guests all expressed their admiration for the bank's thoughtful service. To commemorate the opening of the branch and to benefit all sectors, the bank has specially revised its various deposit and transaction regulations. This includes the direct matching of payment dates, extended payment hours, and Saturday morning office hours, all of which are precedents in the industry. It has also added both fixed and flexible trust deposits, with monthly interest accrual and the ability to withdraw principal and interest at any time. This provides the convenience of a current account and the superior interest rates of a fixed deposit, making it the most cost-effective deposit option. Furthermore, a women's trust department has been established, opening a new path for serving women in the city. It offers a full range of household services, accepts various women's deposits, and provides exquisite commemorative gifts for distribution. In total, over 600 accounts were opened throughout the day, with women's deposits accounting for over 200 of them.

Forcing a Young Girl into Prostitution

Qian Pushi, a 46-year-old woman from Suzhou, was struggling with poverty and hardship. Around the first month of the lunar year, she sold her 15-year-old daughter, Caiying, to Pan Axiu, a procuress from the same village, for 140 yuan. Caiying was renamed Simei and placed in Tang Ji Hanzhuang at 8 Guian Lane, North Chujia Bridge, to work as a prostitute. Recently, the French police received a letter from Suzhou reporting the incident. They dispatched detectives to arrest the procuress Pan Axiu, the girl, and the girl's mother, Qian Pushi, and brought them to the Second Special Court for legal prosecution. Judge Jiang Fengquan concluded the trial and scheduled a sentencing date, ordering the defendants to each provide a shop guarantee pending the verdict. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang sentenced Pan Axiu to four months of imprisonment for assisting in intentional rape. Qian Pushi was found not guilty, and Qian Caiying was handed over to her mother, Qian Pushi, with a written guarantee that she would not engage in prostitution again, under threat of severe punishment for any violation. The owner of Tang Ji Hanzhuang is reportedly being sought by the police for arrest and separate prosecution. Qian Pushi, a 46-year-old woman from Suzhou, was struggling with poverty and hardship.

### Regarding the Subsidized Rice for Staff of the Commercial Press: Staff Unanimously Request Conversion to Cash Allowance; Company's Shanghai Authorities Have Accepted the Proposal; Currently Requesting Instructions from Highest Authorities in Hong Kong

To the Editor:

Having read the article introducing the subsidized rice scheme for staff of the Commercial Press in your esteemed publication yesterday, our association has some disagreement with these opinions. Therefore, we specifically submit a letter and an elaboration on the flaws of the subsidized rice scheme. We earnestly request its publication in your esteemed newspaper, and we would be extremely grateful. - The Commercial Press Staff Association (seal)

Due to the recent rapid rise in prices in the isolated island, all industries have automatically improved their compensation. Therefore, the staff of the Commercial Press, driven by the pressure of life, initiated a subsidy movement last month. After many twists and turns, the company recently announced the so-called subsidized rice scheme. (The details were published in the previous issue of this publication.) This scheme still has shortcomings, which are analyzed below:

(1) The subsidized rice scheme allocates grain according to the number of people in a household. Rural dependents are certainly not able to enjoy it, and families with more than two children also have no rice to eat. Furthermore, the salaries of junior staff are meager, and most dependents are unable to live in Shanghai, so they fundamentally cannot enjoy the benefits of subsidized rice.

(2) Since low-paid employees are mostly unable to bring their dependents with them, they can only eat at boarding houses when they are alone in Shanghai. How can they dispose of the twenty catties of subsidized rice provided by the company? Furthermore, the price is only about 1.7 or 1.8 yuan cheaper than the market price. In fact, the loss of time and transportation costs to buy this twenty catties of subsidized rice may exceed this amount!

(3) Rice weevils are notoriously bloodsucking creatures. The company's subsidized rice scheme, passing through their hands repeatedly, will undoubtedly be discounted in both quality and quantity. (The last time the company purchased rice for the staff, this phenomenon already occurred and can be cited as an example.)

(3) Originally, our purpose in initiating this subsidy movement was entirely for the sake of junior staff. In fact, the lower the salary, the more severe the pressure of life. This subsidized rice scheme still provides no practical benefit to the majority of junior staff. Therefore, we staff members absolutely do not accept this subsidized rice scheme. However, in order to protect the company and understand its difficulties, and unwilling to cause the company to increase its expenses during this extraordinary period, we calmly suggested two points to the company authorities:

1. The company should convert the subsidized rice expenses, which are budgeted at 10,000 yuan per month, into cash allowances for staff.

2. The standard should not be based on the number of family members, but on the individual salary of the staff member. The lower the salary, the more the subsidy should be. The maximum amount may be based on the 12.5 yuan announced by the company.

Now the company's Shanghai authorities have accepted our two proposals and are requesting instructions from the highest authorities in Hong Kong. We think that this will not increase the company's projected expenses, and it will also reduce many of the hassles of subsidized rice. We believe that General Manager Wang will certainly approve it. Then our great storm of February can be calmed down in this way.

### Wang Shizi's Painting Exhibition

Wang Shizi has devoted himself to the study of painting for nearly forty years. His works, including flowers, trees, rocks, birds, animals, and insects, are all exquisite. His compositions, structures, brushwork, and coloring do not fall into ordinary patterns. His calligraphy is also ancient and vigorous, and his seal script is particularly powerful and refined. Shizi's solo exhibition of over one hundred calligraphy and painting works will be held at the Daxon Department Store on the fourth floor for four days, starting from September 22nd, for art lovers to appreciate.

### The Moon is Especially Bright During Mid-Autumn Festival

- Ziqiang

The "Ice" signs are still fluttering in the hot sun, but "Mid-Autumn Mooncakes" have already been baked early, adding color to the streets in early autumn. As fashionable women's new clothes change with the season, the competition between various businesses in Shanghai is also very sensitive. After the sweltering summer, everyone feels a different kind of pleasure at the arrival of early autumn: it is like a long-separated old friend, and like a lover in anticipation. A lively scene unfolds on the streets, and people's steps are firm and cheerful. In front of the silk and satin shops, men and women are crowded, cutting out winter clothes. They choose seasonal colors and calculate the distribution for the family.

Mid-Autumn is a good festival in early autumn, and perhaps to welcome the arrival of early autumn, the custom of a reunion festival has been established on this night of August 15th. Between friends and relatives, gifts are exchanged to enhance feelings, and families also make some preparations to enjoy the pleasures of family. The people who wander around these shops are full of joyful atmosphere.

Compared with previous years, even before the war, who can see any difference on the streets of the "isolated island" in early autumn?

But every year on the bright moon night, how can one bear to recall the past? The homeless people sleeping on the streets can no longer withstand the cold dew of midnight and early morning, and they are beginning to feel the threat of housing. Looking at the signs fluttering in the wind, they also feel the sorrow of "the whole family is in the cold wind, and the September clothes have not yet been cut."

And the arrival of this reunion festival adds infinite melancholy! Who does not have a happy family, who does not have sweet memories? But now, looking at our distant homes, only rubble remains; where have our parents, brothers, and sisters wandered to? On this moonlit night, how can we celebrate the joy of reunion?

The advertisements for mooncakes touch people's eyes, and the exquisite arrangements in the glass windows even tempt people's saliva. It is Mid-Autumn Festival, and the division between joy and sorrow, although separated by a clear gap, the scenery in front of us makes us doubt our own eyes - passers-by greet each other with smiles; all kinds of signs dazzle the eyes. Where can you find the division between joy and sorrow?

Five days later, on the evening under the bright moonlight, in the light breeze, perhaps someone will be chanting the poem "Raise your head and gaze at the bright moon, lower your head and think of your hometown." That is the answer you are looking for.

Chapter 16: Planning to Promote Medical Science and Education; Thinking to Expand Village Governance and Childcare

However, her reputation there is even greater than that of the Women and Children's Hospital. Many people who come to seek talent are also looking for talent from the Nursery, thinking that the nannies in the Nursery are top-notch. Otherwise, how could the triplets be so well cared for? Therefore, Dr. Zhang's position now has at least two aspects. One is the position of cultivating obstetric and pediatric medical talent, and the other is the position of cultivating nursery nanny talent. Naturally, her position has expanded, but she still wants to hold on to this position. Her current ambition is to establish a medical school in Anle Town; this medical school focuses on obstetrics and pediatrics. In addition, she wants to establish a nursing school, which, needless to say, focuses more on nannies for the Nursery, and wants to raise them to be able to serve as kindergarten teachers. Indeed, obstetrics and pediatrics departments everywhere feel a shortage, and nannies are also in greater demand than supply, because nurseries are being established everywhere. Although Dr. Zhang has made this wish, the funding problem has not yet been settled. Therefore, this time she turned to Mrs. Suriya's idea. To be honest, if she doesn't turn to her idea, then she won't, but once she turns to her idea, she has to beg for a big donation. Dr. Zhang's intention is to ask Mrs. Suriya for help, to find a way to raise a sum of money. With this sum of money, we can start running the school. These two schools can be opened in one place, so it's good to be able to practice there. When people come to seek talent, we can recommend them to various places. In one year, we can train at least hundreds of talents. If Mrs. Suriya is willing to support this school for training talents on her own, then we will name this school Suriya School to leave a memorial for Mr. Suriya. Although Dr. Zhang and Mrs. Suriya have this friendship, it also depends on Jin Danyun's encouragement from the side, beating a side drum. Therefore, this time, in addition to personally visiting Mrs. Suriya, Zhu Ai will also take the opportunity to ask this bride for a big favor at the wedding banquet. Because this is a good thing, the inland areas lack those villagers, causing ordinary people to sink into diseases and suffering. And the infant mortality rate is increasing because the protection is not proper, which is especially alarming. I hope Jin Danyun can help, give birth to a fair and plump son next year, which is to repay your kindness! Because Yu Danyun has always had no requests for Mrs. Suriya, and has never asked her to help with anything. Now Jin Danyun is saying good words to Mrs. Suriya for this public welfare matter, Mrs. Suriya must agree with a full mouth. (184)

### Suzhou Creek's Night Pilgrimage Before the Transformation

- Liu Lang

As we eagerly await the opening of the Hongkou district, the obstacles on the north bank of Suzhou Road are beginning to expand and swell through the incubation of the air.

I stepped onto the north bank of Suzhou Creek on the eve of its transformation with a feeling of regret. I don't know if I am on a pilgrimage? Or is it a lament?

The evolution of history is cruel. Although the north bank of Suzhou Creek is so ordinary, yesterday's north bank of Suzhou Creek suddenly became beautiful in my eyes. I ignited a reluctant affection for it. I wanted to comfort it, but how could I start to comfort it? However, the last impression it left me will never be erased.

When I crossed the Suzhou Creek that was like a dyeing vat, my heart was unusually excited.

When I reached the end of North Henan Road, I couldn't bear to see the scenery at the end of my eyes, but the worn-out picture at the end still tightly gripped people's hearts, making you feel pain, making you feel resentment.

Right next to that iron gate, I saw the young, dashing, and orderly Scottish soldiers. From their beautiful steps, my heart also raised pieces of gratitude, thanking them for fulfilling their life's obligations on the north bank of Suzhou Creek, enduring the artificial wind, frost, rain, and snow.

I quietly walked east along Laobazi Road, and looked suspiciously at the building under repair wrapped in lead wire mesh at the Fusheng Road intersection. Ahead, the obstacles tell you that you have to turn on North Jiangxi Road.

From that turning place, I discovered the new wounds that had been added here. The triangular lead wire mesh tightly surrounded the street-facing houses at the eastern end of North Jiangxi Road.

Like visiting a prison, friends of passers-by met at both ends of the lead wire mesh. They couldn't be intimately together, they could only stand at both ends and talk. People outside the circle bought things from the shops inside the circle, shrinking like escapees.

Wenjianshi Road and Zhapu Road have completely changed their appearance. I feel the same infinite attachment to the British soldiers standing on the edge as I do to the worried residents.

### Ten Thousand People Compete to See a Red Pearl! (Part 1) - A Record of Song Dezhu, Who Finally Came Out After a Thousand Calls

- Tong Yu Yuchi

Yesterday (the 19th) afternoon, I went to lecture at two universities. After returning to my humble study, I saw two name cards from Song Dezhu and Wu Yanheng on my desk, as well as a letter of introduction from Mr. Zhou Guanqing of the Beiping Youth Association. I knew they had been there while I was out. After asking my family, I also learned that Mr. Wu Huansun had accompanied them. Mr. Wu's Chinese painting and drama studies have long been admired by me. I felt very regretful for losing the opportunity to meet them immediately.

In the South, the general friends who like to talk about old operas, after reading Tongzhai's drama talks that I have been writing continuously for the past two years, have no doubt that Dezhu and I must have had a very deep friendship in the past. The people in Beiping are also like this. For example, in the recently published Liyan Pictorial Issue 49, someone wrote an article saying: "Song Dezhu's decision to go to Shanghai, with Mr. Tongzhai Yiyi's prior propaganda, has already achieved the point of winning without fighting." In fact, I have said before that Dezhu and I have never met; I have never done propaganda for Song Dezhu or anyone else. I have always been a cautious and taciturn person. Not only can I not write articles, but I am also poor at wording and speaking. I teach in the university, and the students only know that Mr. Liu's blackboard notes are particularly numerous, but they do not feel that he particularly likes to lecture. In this way, when I met and shook hands with Mr. Wu, Dezhu, Baosen, Yanheng and others in a certain place this afternoon (the 20th), I was so ashamed that I couldn't say a word?

But why should I say anything? Dezhu, who amazed everyone with his first performance, has now become a dazzling "red pearl." As I implied in the above, I actually have not contributed a single bit. The leader of the female martial roles is originally rare in the old opera circles, often not getting one or two outstanding talents in ten or twenty years. As far as I can see, Jiu Zhenfeng (deceased), Zhu Guifang, Qiu Futang, Fang Lianyuan..., they all enjoyed fame on the red carpet for the past twenty years with their skills in female martial roles. Unfortunately, they are now like withered flowers, leaving the stage and no longer able to "sway the spring breeze and please the spring day"! In recent years? Song Dezhu, Ge Shishan, and Zhu Shengfu can all be regarded as the newest talents in female martial roles. Shengfu is Guifang's nephew, and Shishan is Lanqiu's (Jiu Zhenfeng) nephew. Both of them have previously performed in Shanghai with other troupes and have received considerable praise. However, in fact, their art is not as superior as Song Dezhu's. When Dezhu was "sitting on the stage" at the Beiping Opera School, because of his superb art, coupled with his willingness to work hard for seven or eight years without interruption, and the patient guidance of the masters of female martial roles, Jiu Zhenfeng, and famous teachers such as Zhu Ruxiang and Wu Fuqin, he has become the leader of the four little famous actors praised by Mr. Xu Lingxiao, the only famous actor who combines "singing, acting, reciting, and fighting". Zhang Shankun personally directed Chen Yunshang's third masterpiece "One Night Empress" premiered at the Shanghai Grand Theater during the Mid-Autumn Festival

### The Full Picture of Nan Tiesheng's Art (Part 2)

- Sick Chicken

Acting and Waist and Legs

Acting includes expressions, steps, water sleeves, body movements, and other items. Tiesheng is best at performing tragedies, with dignified gestures, calm demeanor, and movements tending to be restrained, which is quite in line with the Qingyi style. The steps are steady and practiced, but lack a graceful and elegant style. The starting step is too fast, without asking for the old road step method. The Qizhuang step method is excellent, which may be influenced by Yaoqing. The water sleeves are too reserved, too steady, resulting in few light and graceful movements, and failing to reach the realm of beauty, which needs to be improved. The body movements also have the same problem, without natural postures. The eyes on the face lack changes, and lack inner performance, failing to fully reveal the plot of the play, resulting in heavy acting plays, such as the "whole Yutang Spring lacking prostitute house chasing Wang sections, the performance is very loose, without highlights, which is due to insufficient technical cultivation and lack of stage experience. Although the waist and legs are necessary skills for martial girls and knife horse girls, Qingyi Huashan is also indispensable. For example, the "Changban Slope" round field, the "Imperial Stele Pavilion" slip step, the "Stab Tang" butt sitting, the "Baihua Pavilion" lying fish, the "Farewell My Concubine" sword dance, etc., without waist and leg skills, it is difficult to be competent and happy. Tiesheng, a ticket fan, went to sea, and the waist and legs did not work hard. When the "court trial sang to the adults," there was a sitting, Tiesheng supported the ground with his hands, and the body was very stiff, showing the childishness of his waist and leg skills. If you want to improve, you must work hard.

Conclusion

To sum up, his art has already given a glimpse of its outline. Tiesheng is a Qingyi talent. Except for the singing voice, all have not reached the ultimate state. However, in this time of shallow and vulgar appreciation standards, how many people can deeply appreciate the rules? Correct Qingyi acting and discover its beauty, and Qingyi has more singing plays, and acting is originally a decisive point, and at the same time, acting is also one of the easiest links to appreciate, because in addition to one or two very shallow problems, ordinary people are very difficult to distinguish between good and bad in singing and reciting, so the "good singing" and "bad singing" said by ordinary people are actually a synonym for expressions that fit the plot and my. Now that Tiesheng has a good voice, if he can devote himself to expression, it is not difficult to become popular in the north and south.

### Hollywood on the Silver Screen

— Jing Yuan

Regarding films made with Hollywood as their theme and background, there was only one previously, "Lotus仙子" (Fúróng xiānzǐ, "Lotus Fairy"). Now, let me introduce two more. One has already been filmed, and the other is in the planning stages.

The film that has already been completed is "Hollywood Cavalcade." It is a grand, colorful production starring Don Ameche, Alice Faye, and Lin Bapa. Al Jolson also makes a cameo in this film, singing a famous song, "Kol Nidre." The film is directed by Irving Cummings and produced by the well-known Darryl Zanuck. The entire film is set against the backdrop of the diverse aspects of Hollywood in the past three years, making it very lively.

The other film currently in pre-production is Warner's colorful blockbuster, "City of the Angels," which is set eighty years ago in Los Angeles and Hollywood, with a touch of legendary color. The main roles are played by Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Ann Sheridan. We know that Los Angeles was a barren land eighty years ago, with most of its residents being rogues and scoundrels. Now, using this as the theme is certainly comparable to "The Public Enemy".

### Viewing Experiences After "Sunrise"

— Nai Wei

The 辣 (Là) Theater, following "Thunderstorm," is performing "Sunrise." Because the cast of this play are all stars, its appeal is quite remarkable. I went to see it the day before yesterday.

The allocation of roles surpasses even the golden age of 中旅 (Zhōng Lǚ): Lu Luming's Chen Bailu, in terms of costumes and makeup, is better than Tang Ruoqing, and her attitude is also quite good, but her pronunciation is very low, which is enough to affect the atmosphere on stage. Because Meng Na's performance as Gu Banainai is realistically atrocious, it often makes Lu Luming smile on stage, which is also undesirable; Zhou Manhua's Xiaodongxi has many lovely qualities; Bai Yan's Cuixi, however, is not good. I have always believed that Cuixi is the most difficult character to portray in "Sunrise." Bai Yan, lacking both boldness and experience, loses all the wonderful aspects that should be there. The inability to speak crisply and decisively is also a major reason for her failure to please. Among the male actors, Zhou Qi's Wang Fusheng is undoubtedly the most captivating, reaching a level of perfection; Bai Yun's Zhang Qiaozhi is, of course, not as skilled as Zheng Zhong.

Zheng Zhong, directing with his qualifications as a former member of 中旅, although generally passable, is not without minor flaws. For example, in terms of sound effects, during the hotel scene, one only hears the sound of playing cards, but never the sound of "shuffling" or "winning," which seems inappropriate; the sound effects in the brothel scene, using two different technologies, produce the same sound, which is also unsatisfactory. Shu Shi's Pan Yueting seems to lack richness in his costumes. Also, when Pan Yueting is on the phone, Gu Banainai is talking to Chen Bailu, and because Gu Banainai is "acting," it causes applause from the audience, but Shu Shi does not continue his phone conversation, instead waiting for Gu Banainai to finish speaking before continuing his lines. This is not only illogical but also has the appearance of desperately trying to please.

The set and lighting are very good, but unfortunately, during the most tense moment in the third act, the lights went out once.

Dramatic Arts

— Chou Cheng

Xu Muyun, Su Shaoqing, Xu Heizhen, Zhang Xiaocang, Li Feishu, Zheng Guoyi, Huang Jingwan, etc., recognizing that dramatic literature and artifacts urgently need to be vigorously promoted to prevent them from being lost over time, and that refugees on the isolated island urgently need to be rescued to prevent them from suffering from hunger and cold, have jointly launched the "Chinese Drama Martial Arts Cultural Relics Exhibition." All proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to refugee relief, achieving two goals with one action. They have already received the support of Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Xu Jikang, and Chen Buchan, among others, to proceed immediately. A preface has already been written, and Pu Dong (Xiyuan), a senior scholar in the field of drama, has been invited to inscribe the title. This is a groundbreaking event, and those with a passion for drama are expected to witness its success soon.
