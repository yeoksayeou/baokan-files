### League of Nations Council Passes Resolution Requesting Countries to Consider Assisting China; Reiterates Previous Resolutions but Does Not Form New Committee; and Notifies All Countries of the Chinese Government's Requests

(Geneva) This morning, the League of Nations Council held a public meeting and passed a resolution on the Sino-Japanese dispute, stating that the Council had previously passed a report on September 30, 1938, advising member states to individually invoke the measures stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant, and to provide China with moral assistance in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on October 6, 1937. It also suggested that member states consider and avoid all actions that would weaken China's resistance and thus increase its difficulties in this dispute, and hoped that each country would individually assist China to the extent possible. Subsequently, the Council passed a resolution on February 2, 1938, trusting that member states, especially those particularly concerned with the situation in the Far East, would make good use of all opportunities to seek a fair solution to this dispute in conjunction with other related countries. Now, the Council, having listened to the speech delivered by Dr. Wellington Koo, the chief representative of China, on the 17th of this month, refuting Japan's attempt to establish a new order in East Asia, and noting that some countries have already taken several steps to assist China, specifically invites member states and other countries with direct relations with the situation in the Far East to consider the recommendations made by Representative Koo to the Council on the 17th of this month, in order to take concrete and effective measures to assist China. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

(Geneva) The resolution first mentions the resolutions passed by the League of Nations General Assembly on October 6, 1937, and by the League of Nations Council on February 1, 1938, and May 14, 1938, as well as the report of the League of Nations Council on September 30, 1938. It then states that the Council has taken note of the Chinese representative's refutation of Japan's claim to establish a new order in the Far East, and of the proposals made by the Chinese government, and has also noted that some countries are already acting individually to assist China. It now requests that member states of the League of Nations, especially those directly concerned with the Far East, as well as other countries that deem it appropriate and have similar relations, consult with each other to study the effective plans proposed by the Chinese representative to the Council on January 17, 1939, especially plans to assist China. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

(Geneva) Before leaving for Paris, Dr. Wellington Koo told a Reuters reporter that the consultations stipulated in the League of Nations Council resolution would begin in the near future. The remarks made by British Under-Secretary of State Butler are quite satisfactory, indicating that the British government is prepared to provide financial assistance to China. At the same time, the Council will notify all member states of his requests made on January 17, including the request to prohibit the transport of aircraft and gasoline to Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Ambassador Koo's Statement: Conditional Acceptance

(Geneva) Regarding the dispute between China and Japan, Dr. Wellington Koo, the chief representative of China, gave a moving speech this morning before the League of Nations Council passed the resolution, stating, "Based on my speech to the Council on the 17th of this month, this resolution is not entirely satisfactory to the Chinese government, but it is the most that the Council can unanimously pass under the current circumstances, so I must accept it. The obligations of treaties must be earnestly respected, and good faith must be maintained. These are generally recognized basic principles in international relations. On the contrary, if one country disregards them, the foundation of peaceful relations among civilized nations will be undermined. There is no need to elaborate on this. Recently, Japan's arbitrary actions to destroy the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, thereby endangering China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the equal opportunities enjoyed by all countries in the Far East, have been firmly opposed by the governments of the three countries most concerned with the Far Eastern issue, and China has also resolutely rejected them. If the Council takes this opportunity to once again condemn Japan's unreasonable actions, it is only right and proper, and the Chinese government firmly believes that actions speak louder than words, and it is appropriate to do so at this moment. Unfortunately, since Japan began its aggression, the League of Nations General Assembly and the Council, as well as the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues, have passed many resolutions and reports, and while some countries have made efforts to implement them, most countries have not paid much attention to them. For example, the past resolutions stated that any actions that would weaken China's resistance should be avoided, but this has not been fully complied with. The military supplies that the Chinese government urgently needs have been restricted or prohibited during transportation and transit. If these difficulties can be quickly overcome, the greatest obstacle to China's resistance will be eliminated, and the various principles of international relations, which were unanimously recognized by the League of Nations in its successive resolutions, will be respected. The Chinese government hopes that the Council will discuss China's requests, as well as the requests I made yesterday, in a sympathetic and accommodating manner, so that China can receive appropriate assistance to crush Japan's aggression. By this day, China has been resisting for a year and a half, and the Chinese people have suffered great pain and sacrifice. Once victory is achieved, the interests of all related countries in the Far East will be preserved, and the principles of international security and world peace will be strengthened, which will be fortunate. Although I accept this resolution of the Council, I must attach a reservation in accordance with the instructions of my government, that is, the appeals that the Chinese government may raise in the future should be submitted to the Council for discussion at any time." (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### Representatives of Various Countries Express Sympathy for China

(Geneva) Representatives of various countries delivered speeches, expressing sympathy for China. French Representative Chavannes said that the patriotism and courage displayed by the Chinese nation in defending its independence have aroused admiration throughout the world. The French public admires the heroic resistance of the Chinese nation, which has lasted for eighteen months. The policy pursued by the French government has always been based on the resolutions passed by the League of Nations, hoping to find a fair solution to the dispute in the Far East, and hoping that China can achieve peace within the limits of national unity demonstrated by its iron and blood. For this reason, the French representative expresses support for the current resolution. France is willing to participate in the assistance that various countries and the League of Nations provide to China in terms of technology, to the extent of its capabilities, and is willing to cooperate fully to restore peace to China and reassert justice. New Zealand Representative Jordan then spoke, expressing regret for the weakness and ineffectiveness of the resolution, and saying that the prohibition of supplying aircraft kerosene to Japan is imperative and cannot be delayed. Soviet Representative Suritz said that his country supports the various requests made by the Chinese representative on the 17th of this month. China is currently engaged in heroic resistance, and we must assist it with all our strength. The obligations that various countries owe to China have not yet been fully fulfilled. As for the current resolution, although the Soviet government considers it insufficient, it is nevertheless an improvement compared to the previous resolutions that have been passed, and therefore has decided to vote in favor of it. However, one thing must be stated: the Soviet Union is prepared to participate in any measures decided by the League of Nations to implement the principle of collective security, because the desire for peace and justice to prevail requires the implementation of a collective security system. At this point, British Foreign Office Official Butler then spoke, expressing sympathy for the suffering felt by China, and saying that Britain is prepared to assist the Chinese government to the extent possible.

### Twists and Turns in the Discussion of the League of Nations Council

(Geneva) In order to review the Chinese representative's proposal, the League of Nations Council meeting formed a drafting committee, consisting of representatives from Britain, France, the Soviet Union, China, Yugoslavia, and Latvia. The first review meeting was scheduled for this afternoon to convene the Chinese representative's proposal, which was roughly divided into the following points: Boycott of Japanese goods; Prohibition of supplying military supplies to Japan; Economic assistance to China; The above-mentioned implementation matters are presided over by a joint adjustment committee composed of countries related to the Far East. At the afternoon meeting, representatives from Britain and France opposed the Chinese proposal, so it was decided to postpone the meeting until tomorrow. According to the British representative's opinion, the first, second, and third items proposed by the Chinese representative are beyond the power of the League of Nations to urgently address under the current circumstances, so it is best for each country to consider this matter separately. Regarding the establishment of an investigation committee, the British representative believed that it would not achieve any results without the participation of the United States. As for the participation of the United States, if the United States Congress cannot pass the amendment legislation, there is absolutely no possibility of participation. At that time, the愿 representative did not insist on changing the name of the committee to the adjustment committee, but said that a permanent committee should be established to preside over international cooperation matters and study effective ways to correct Japan's aggression. Therefore, the drafting committee will discuss it based on Representative Koo's re-submitted proposal at its meeting tomorrow, but it still intends to include Representative Koo's proposal when drafting the resolution, so as to reserve it for future discussions. International criticism believes that since the Munich Conference, Britain has decided to avoid anything that would prevent Germany and Italy from rejoining the League of Nations and hinder the resolution of the European situation. Britain's attitude towards the Chinese representative's proposal is also in line with this intention. (Dispatch, 18th)

(Geneva) The drafting committee convened again today to discuss the Chinese proposal. After three hours of discussion, it was decided not to organize a committee to deal with the Far East incident, but advocated that countries related to the Far East should consider effective ways to realize the points advocated by the Chinese representative individually. Regarding the boycott of Japanese goods and the prohibition of supplying military supplies to Japan, the drafting committee decided to advocate expanding the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on October 6. The drafting committee's new resolution has a total of 1,037 characters, which does not involve the boycott of Japanese goods or the blockade of Japan. The committee will convene again tonight to discuss the resolution and submit it to a public meeting for approval tomorrow morning. The 104th session of the League of Nations Council is scheduled to close tomorrow. (Dispatch, 19th)

### League of Nations Passes Resolution Condemning Bombing of Civilians

(Geneva) At its meeting this morning, the League of Nations Council, in addition to passing a resolution on the dispute between China and Japan, also passed a resolution on the issue of ordinary people in Spain being subjected to aerial bombardment. It condemned all methods of warfare that violate human conscience and human rights, and took note of the fact that the Spanish Republican government did not use retaliatory measures against ordinary people within the territory controlled by the Nationalist army. Representatives from Bolivia and Peru in South America both waived their voting rights. In addition, before declaring the closure of the 104th regular meeting, the Council requested that member states step up the supply of food to Spain. At this point, Spanish Republican Government Representative and Foreign Minister臺爾伐育 stood up to thank the Council, and said that the food supplied by various countries would be used to distribute to all people in the country without any discrimination.

Editorial

### Promoting Conscription and Developing Local Economy

The day before yesterday, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram to the whole country, hoping that local gentry would assist the government in promoting conscription and developing the local economy, so as to enhance the strength of the protracted war. These two points, based on the experience of nineteen months of resistance, are indeed the most urgent requirements for China to strive for final victory. At the same time, they are also the common voice of the soldiers fighting on the front lines and the people of the whole country.

After the outbreak of the all-out war, the replenishment of manpower and material resources has become a prerequisite for striving for final victory. To replenish manpower, it is necessary to mobilize the entire population to participate in the war of resistance, and it is necessary to implement the conscription law as soon as possible to replenish the soldiers on various battlefields. To replenish material resources, in addition to establishing national defense industries and military supply industries, it is necessary to develop the local economy and increase production. In the past, the central government had actively promoted this, but it had not received the full assistance of the local gentry, and there had been no great effect.

This is an undeniable fact. In the past, some local authorities inevitably used coercive measures for the conscription and training of soldiers. They could not carry out widespread and in-depth propaganda on the meaning of military service, and they did not have proper guarantees for the lives of the conscripted young men and their families. Moreover, corrupt officials and local bullies took the opportunity to extort and fleece, so young men in various places still inevitably resorted to buying substitutes, making false claims, and avoiding military service. This phenomenon of failing to make full use of manpower is a major loss to the strength of the war of resistance. In the future, in order to remedy the previous defects, the local gentry should immediately follow the strategies indicated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. In addition to sending their own sons of conscription age to the army without waiting for conscription, setting an example for the general public, they should also assist the local authorities in eliminating the above-mentioned malpractices. The minimum goal should also be: First, earnestly carry out widespread conscription propaganda. Organize conscription propaganda personnel training classes, gather relatively progressive elements, provide them with appropriate training, on the one hand, improve their understanding of the protracted war and their spirit of serving the country, and on the other hand, impart the necessary knowledge and skills for engaging in conscription propaganda. After the training is completed, distribute them to various places to carry out widespread and in-depth propaganda, so that all young men have the spirit of happily serving in the army and the determination to sacrifice for the country. Second, eradicate coercive conscription methods. Under the efforts of conscription agencies at all levels and conscription propaganda personnel, first incorporate all young men into local self-defense teams, regularly educate them, expand their concept of defending the local area, and strive to defend the country, and then, in accordance with the instructions of the military district and legal procedures, call on the advanced elements among them to voluntarily sign up for conscription. Then, through their encouragement, gradually attract the remaining backward elements. Third, earnestly treat the soldiers going on expeditions and their families well, and protect their lives. Although the authorities have repeatedly issued clear orders on the preferential treatment of soldiers going on expeditions and their families, at this time when the country is in urgent need and the national financial resources are insufficient, the local gentry should adhere to the principle of contributing money when they have it, assist the local authorities at any time, and strive to achieve it, so that the soldiers going on expeditions have no worries about the future. Fourth, earnestly improve training methods. In the training of new soldiers, military education and political education must be given equal importance, so that all soldiers understand the domestic and international situation, the meaning of the protracted war, and the reasons why the people must serve in the military. If these four minimum goals can be achieved one by one, the promotion of conscription will naturally be easy and smooth.

As for the development of the local economy, because it has not been carried out in a practical manner in the past, production has not increased. This is a great defect in the resource supply for the protracted war. Since the war of resistance, all the places occupied by the Japanese army have mostly become scorched earth. Not only have the only national industries in these places been destroyed, but also the employees have been displaced and have nothing to rely on; even the vast number of farmers have been forced to flee due to the ravages of the Japanese army, resulting in the abandonment of fields. This phenomenon has made the national finance and economy increasingly difficult. If there is no way to remedy it, it will be impossible to overcome the difficulties of the war. Therefore, the local gentry should quickly assist the local government, and in addition to finding ways to develop the original national industries, they should also find ways to develop the national rural areas and handicrafts, and give appropriate jobs to the unemployed and vagrants according to their talents and skills, so as to combine the idle manpower and the capital resources that have not been used. This can not only relieve the suffering of the unemployed and vagrants, but also greatly increase the production quantity of industry and agriculture. If the national finance can be based on these new industries and agriculture, there will be no worry about the resource supply for the protracted war.

China's war of resistance has lasted for 19 months, and although the Japanese army has invaded deeply, it has fallen into a dilemma. The recent international situation is very favorable to China, and as long as we can continue to work hard and struggle, there is no doubt that the final victory will be won.

All French troops have been ordered to gather in Tokyo Bay, which further confirms the belief that the Japanese army will land in Beihai in order to cut off the railway between Haiphong and Nanning. The large concentration of troops by the Japanese army on 州島 proves that the Japanese army's actions are imminent. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)

### Wang Jingwei: Removal from Party Membership; National Political Council Speakership to be Assumed by President Chiang; Recent Decision of the Central Executive Committee to Strengthen Ties Between the People and the Government

(Chongqing) The Speakership of the National Political Council was originally held by Wang Jingwei, who has now been expelled from the party and removed from all positions. It is now learned that the 111th Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee has resolved to elect President Chiang to assume the position. (20th Dispatch)

(Chongqing) The Standing Committee of the Kuomintang held a meeting yesterday afternoon and resolved to appoint Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the Chairman of the National Political Council. It is said that the reason for adopting this resolution is to demonstrate Chairman Chiang's safeguarding of the principles of democracy in national life. Furthermore, due to recent rumors regarding new candidates for the position, it is hoped that Chairman Chiang's assumption of the chairmanship will win widespread approval. This move can strengthen the ties between the people and the government, which is the purpose of the establishment of the National Political Council. Furthermore, the establishment of the council is intended as the first stage in establishing freedom and democracy in China. The councilors are representatives of outstanding men and women selected from various provinces in proportion, including educators, political leaders, and prominent figures in local government affairs. The National Political Council does not have administrative power, but it can submit resolutions to the government. If a resolution is passed by a vote, the government must consider it. According to the founders of the council, as China's liberation progresses, they hope to grant this group greater power. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

(Chongqing) Reuters learned today that during the meeting of the Central Executive Committee, Chairman Chiang will deliver a lecture on the New Meanings of the Three Principles of the People, as previous interpretations have been inconsistent.

It is expected that there will be no major political decisions at the meeting, nor will there be any major changes in government figures, as there is no need to change government figures politically, so it is not appropriate to do so at this time.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Telegram to the Nation: Hoping That Local Gentry Will Serve Their Hometowns and Advocate for Military Service and Economic Development

(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) First, we should assist the government in implementing military service to replenish the urgently needed troops for the war of resistance. On the one hand, we should fully publicize the facts of the enemy's brutality and the relationship between the success or failure of the war of resistance and the implementation of military service, so as to arouse the people's awareness of resisting the enemy and encourage them to enlist. On the other hand, we should provide local assistance in holding lotteries, punishing tax evasion, rewarding enlistment, and comforting the families of those who go to war, so as to make the people happy to join the army and feel at ease in fighting. At the same time, the children of conscription age of the local gentry should take the lead in sending themselves to enlist in the army, regardless of whether they are selected or not, or sending them to take the entrance examinations for various military academies, so as to promote public opinion. The people will surely follow suit, and the front line will be full of soldiers, and victory will be more assured. Moreover, after the establishment of the conscription system, conscription will be abolished, and the country will be built and the people will be secured forever, which is beneficial to the country and has no end. It is not only that the children join the army, and their names are recorded in history, but also that they fulfill the meaning of loyalty and filial piety. Second, we should actively develop the local economy to replenish the resources for the long-term war of resistance. Modern warfare is completely a final competition of manpower and material resources. Moreover, at present, our country has been occupied by some important cities, and overseas transportation ports have been blocked. Industrial and commercial institutions have suffered all kinds of destruction, and all kinds of goods are difficult to supply. Moreover, most of the people who have been employed in industry and commerce have ended their capital businesses and returned to their hometowns due to the war. Based on these facts, we should take this opportunity to correct the past mistakes of focusing on urban construction, and develop the resources of the inland economy in a planned and organized manner, on the one hand, to maintain the supply of military needs for the war of resistance, and on the other hand, to establish a permanent self-sufficiency in the people's daily life. All matters such as opening up wasteland, afforestation, animal husbandry, and strengthening rural production and increasing raw material output should be adapted to local conditions, and funds and efforts should be pooled to divide the labor and cooperate. It is hoped that the wise men in various places will carefully request and advance in separate directions, and the government will do its best to assist and especially maintain it. It is allowed that for all kinds of economic persistence, it is enough to control the enemy's life. The above two items are the most simple and easy to implement in the key items of our general mobilization for the war of resistance, and they are also the source of military, military, financial, and material resources for our war of resistance. Since the enemy started the war the year before last, the conscription of its military service has been reduced again and again, and now even those who do not meet the requirements of physical fitness have been forced to enlist. The total amount of wartime public bonds issued by it has reached about 9 billion yen, and its temporary searches and inspections of donations are still not enough. The gap between the obligations of the people of our country is very large. What's more, we are a country that has been invaded, and now we are breathing between life and death. What the government expects from the efforts of our compatriots is still to make it easy. If the local leaders who are responsible for leading the people cannot set an example or cannot fulfill their responsibilities well, it should not be what those who have been molded by thousands of years of loyalty and filial piety should have. Furthermore, since you millions of soldiers are bleeding and killing the enemy on the battlefield, and the compatriots in the occupied areas are suffering from the devastation of the brutal enemy, and are fighting in difficult conditions, all our compatriots in the rear should, in accordance with the meaning of spiritual mobilization, temper their lives and share the joys and sorrows, so as to show the determination of the front and rear to fight against the enemy together. All matters such as banning gambling, eliminating opium, cracking down on obscenity, and correcting idleness should be promoted by the local gentry and educators as an example, and assist the government to earnestly implement it, directly changing the local atmosphere, and indirectly strengthening the strength of the war of resistance. In ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, there has never been a country that can achieve prosperity if its customs are lewd and decadent, and the transfer of world fortune and customs has never been achieved without relying on a few gentlemen with virtue and morality to advocate and agitate for it. I, the chairman of the committee, have been entrusted by my compatriots to bear the heavy responsibility of presiding over the overall situation of the war of resistance, and I am always working hard to achieve the goal of winning the war of resistance and building the country. My spirit and mind are always in touch with the wise men of the country. I sincerely believe that the completion of this arduous mission cannot be achieved by the labor of one hand or one foot alone. It must rely on the wise men of the country to work together with one heart and one mind in various places, so that people can make the best of their talents and things can be used to the fullest, and then they can achieve the success of many attacks and easy lifting. I deeply believe that the wise men of the country will surely be able to devote their loyalty, fulfill their responsibilities, and exert their unreleased strength, so as to live up to the earnest expectations. As for the local advantages and disadvantages, and the people's hardships, the wise men of the country, based on their experience in service, only need to be true to the facts, and they can state the facts directly. I will surely adopt them sincerely and use them as a basis for discussion. I cannot express everything in writing, but I only hope to work hard in time to achieve the success of the long-term war of resistance and defeat the enemy, and to achieve our task of self-help and saving the country. The country and the nation are really relying on it. Chiang Kai-shek Hao. (19th Dispatch)

### US Airplanes Will Not Be Supplied to Japan at All; All Factories Have Accepted the State Department's Advice; Stimson Reissues Impartial Remarks

Secretary of State Hull immediately expressed satisfaction. Since then, Japan has been unable to purchase aircraft from the United States. (19th Havas Dispatch)

(New York) Stimson, chairman of the American "Don't Help Japan's Aggression Committee," issued an article today, denouncing the United States' shipment of arms and raw materials to Japan. The committee was established yesterday and its members are mostly well-known figures. Its purpose is to prevent the sale of scrap iron, steel and other military raw materials to Japan through legislation. The article stated, "Americans are extremely indignant at Japan's aggression against China and its wanton killing of unarmed Chinese people. It is ignorant and regards the lives and suffering of others as nothing to supply Japan with scrap iron, steel and other military supplies since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. At the same time, we are preparing to use huge sums of money to strengthen national defense to prevent the invasion of others, while providing others with the raw materials, automobiles, scrap iron and machines necessary for war to manufacture murderous tools. Is there anything more contradictory than this?" (20th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Chongqing) The China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement recently sent a telegram of congratulations and thanks from the two presidents, Song Ziwen and Shao Lizi, to former US Secretary of State Stimson for initiating the organization of the "Committee to Not Participate in Japanese Aggression Actions" in the United States and striving to ban the import of arms or military supplies to Japan, which is a great action for international figures to uphold justice. The telegram is as follows: "On behalf of the Chinese people, we hereby express our heartfelt thanks and congratulations to you for initiating the American Committee to Not Participate in Japanese Aggression Actions. Your move is indeed a historic move. You have created the non-recognition doctrine in the past, leading the world to deny the facts created by Japanese violence in Manchuria. If this move can be realized and thoroughly implemented, it will definitely weaken the power of violence and quickly stop common aggression. Your success is China's victory, and it is also the restoration of world peace and justice." (20th Dispatch)

### Fortifying Guam Is Not Yet Confirmed; Roosevelt Says It Awaits Passage of Funding

(Washington) Regarding the construction of a military port by the United States on Guam, President Roosevelt stated today that unless Congress approves US$5 million for the construction of fortifications on Guam, he cannot make a decision on this matter. According to a report in the New York Times by its Washington correspondent, Liebermann, the construction of fortifications on Guam has a political nature, so it may be discussed with Japan beforehand. It is expected that although Congress can approve this plan, the funding will be determined by the State Department after discussing with Japan in accordance with Article 19 of the Washington Treaty. If Japan opposes this move, the US will also ask Japan to remove the various defensive facilities on the mandated islands. (20th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Washington) Democratic Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, recently submitted a bill to the Senate, proposing to build new or strengthen existing air bases in (1) Dutch Harbor, Kodiak Island, Alaska Peninsula; (2) Cedarville and Pensacola, Florida; (3) Guam, Palmyra Island, Johnston Island, Wake Island, Midway Island, Hawaiian Islands, Pearl Harbor and Kauai Harbor in the Pacific Ocean; and (4) San Juan Port, Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea, requiring a total expenditure of US$65 million. Regarding the fortification of Guam, newspapers in the United States and Japan have engaged in heated debates. According to the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, neither the United States nor Japan may build defensive works on their respective islands in the Pacific Ocean. Regarding this point, Walsh recently told a Havas reporter that the government does not intend to build a naval base on Guam according to the report submitted by Rear Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. The bill I submitted only proposes to build a civilian air base on the island and to dredge the port to facilitate navigation, but all facilities are non-military in nature. In general, it is said that if Walsh's bill is passed, the Navy Department will be able to build a civilian air base on Guam and improve port facilities so that large US ships can also sail in and anchor. As for the issue of fortification, although Japan has built defensive works on the mandated islands, the United States has always adhered to the provisions of the Washington Treaty and has not built fortifications on the islands in the Pacific Ocean. This issue can be discussed when the United States and Japan discuss the general situation in the Far East in the future. (19th Havas Dispatch)

### US China Legislation: Amendment Movement Shelved; Senate Foreign Relations Committee Decides to Postpone Deliberation on Pittman Amendment to Silver Purchase Act

(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee met today and unanimously decided to postpone the discussion on the current neutrality law amendment issue, and passed a motion stating that the committee should decide when to submit this issue for discussion, instead of following the usual practice of having the committee chairman initiate it. Political figures commented on this matter, saying that the US government's attempt to amend the neutrality law has failed due to the opposition of the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The members believe that the issue of whether to abolish the ban on sending arms to Spain has already caused controversy. No clear distinction has been made as to the outcome of this debate, and the neutrality law amendment issue should not be submitted for discussion until the European situation is clarified. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has two bills to discuss, one is the bill proposed by Democratic Senator King that the current neutrality law should be repealed, and the other is the bill proposed by Republican Senator Nye that US arms should only be transported to the Americas, whether in peacetime or wartime, and should not be transported to other countries.

The main points are as follows: (1) The domestic silver purchase procedure stipulates that the silver price is 64.25 cents per ounce. After the effective period of this procedure expires on July 1 of this year, it should be raised to $1.20 per ounce to be in line with the real price. (2) The funds that the US government can use to purchase silver abroad according to the world silver price should be used to purchase domestic silver. (3) The 50% tax on the surplus earned by private silver sales was intended to prevent speculation, but it is enough to destroy the domestic silver market and should be abolished. (4) The annual silver purchase quantity should not exceed 90 million ounces. (18th Havas Dispatch)

### German Central Bank: President Replaced - Schacht Out, Funk Concurrently Appointed

(Berlin) It has been recently ordered by Führer Hitler that Minister of Economic Affairs Funk concurrently serve as the President of the National Bank. The former President of the National Bank, Schacht, will remain as a minister without portfolio, no longer holding concurrent positions. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

(Berlin) Regarding the concurrent appointment of Minister of Economic Affairs Funk as President of the Central Bank, the semi-official German News Agency recently issued a statement explaining that, for the sake of facilitating the completion of national economic tasks, the guiding power over national political economy, currency, and finance must be unified. This is why Führer Hitler appointed Minister Funk to concurrently serve as President of the Central Bank. His term of office is set at four years. Furthermore, Führer Hitler also sent a letter to Dr. Funk, roughly stating: "You will be responsible for three tasks: (1) Wages and prices must absolutely maintain equilibrium, as in the past; (2) Raise the necessary funds to meet financial needs; (3) According to National Socialist principles, reorganize the Central Bank so that it becomes a bank solely under the control of national sovereignty." At the same time, the Führer also conveyed a message to the former President of the Central Bank, Schacht, stating: "You have done much for the country and me personally in the past, and I am deeply grateful. I hope you will continue to exert yourself for the country in other areas as a minister without portfolio." Informed sources here have recently commented on Dr. Schacht's departure, saying that this move is purely for the adjustment of the economic organization and that the rumors that Dr. Schacht has had misunderstandings with various leaders of the National Socialist Party are not true. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

Moreover, not long ago, Schacht paid a return visit to England, as the distinguished guest of the Governor of the Bank of England, Norman, who had previously returned the visit to Berlin to strengthen friendship. Now that Schacht has suddenly left office for unknown reasons, people in political and journalistic circles here are paying very close attention. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)

### Gandhi Condemns Hitler's Tyranny, Czech Cossack Leader Goes to Berlin, Germany Incites Canadian Ukrainians

"I believe that if there are courageous people among the German Jews who stand up and lead the people in non-violent actions, then in an instant, the despairing winter they are in can be transformed into a hopeful spring.

It then discusses the Palestine issue, saying that Palestine belongs to the Arabs, just as England belongs to the English. It is wrong and inhumane for Jews to forcefully seize the Arabs' land. However, the violence of the Arabs cannot be forgiven. Finally, it mentions the Jewish call for the establishment of a nation in Palestine, saying, "Why don't Jews do as other peoples do, making their homes in the country where they were born and seek a livelihood?"

### Dissection of Japan's Invasion of China: Steps and Strategies

### The Black Dragon Society Advocates for Rapid Military Aggression; Fascists Use Shinto to Fool Military and Civilians; Current Military Strategy and Tactics Contradict Each Other

Japan's invasion of China has been a long-held ambition. However, the Chinese people's knowledge of its invasion steps and various strategies may not be comprehensive. Recently, the "Officer Corps Who Will Not Be Slaves" has, based on their usual research on Japan, provided a detailed analysis. This group has focused on "Integrated Operations of Personality Warfare" to contribute operational summaries to the authorities, disseminate the meaning of warfare to the people, and, based on the principle that the people are more important than the military, promote effective cooperation between the people and the military. Therefore, they have specially published their research findings on Japan in a simplified form, so that the people nationwide can acquire the wisdom of knowing themselves and their enemies, and thus be assured of victory. The following is a verbatim transcript.

First, Japan's Overall Strategy of Dividing China

After systematic analysis, Gotō Shinpei was identified as a major bureaucrat and politician in Japan, and a leader in the strategy of dividing China. Many of the secret strategies for ruling Taiwan and Korea, and for annexing the Chinese mainland, originated with him. The South Manchuria Railway was established under his guidance. He had great advisors, who encompassed Chinese and Western learning, to assist him. One was Kano Naoki, a teacher to three emperors of the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa eras. He specialized in the study of Chinese learning, and co-authored "Administrative Law of the Qing Dynasty" with Oda Yorozu. The other was Oda Yorozu, who specialized in Western learning, focusing on Western jurisprudence. Gotō Shinpei benefited greatly from these two.

Below Gotō Shinpei, there were three major factions and four major figures. The first major faction was the Southern faction, with Inukai Tsuyoshi and Tōyama Mitsuru as its two major figures. Inukai Tsuyoshi was a member of the Japanese Diet and was appointed Prime Minister; he was a politician. In 1931, when Japan launched the "September 18th" Mukden Incident in Northeast China, and in 1932 when the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident broke out, Inukai Tsuyoshi strongly advocated that Japan should quickly end its physical military aggression against China and instead adopt a far-sighted chemical-style of aggression. Consequently, in 1932, the "May 15th" Incident occurred in Japan, and Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated. Tōyama Mitsuru was the leader of the Japanese ronin (masterless samurai), and founded the famous ronin group Genyosha. He advocated invading China by force. He is still alive today, and thus his views on China are completely opposite to those of Inukai Tsuyoshi. Between these two was Miyazaki Torazo, also known as Shiranamian Tōten.

The second major faction was the Kyoto faction, with Ozaki Yukio as its sole figure. He was a member of the Japanese Diet, and served as the Mayor of Tokyo and the Minister of Education; he was an educator. He opposed military aggression against China and is still alive today.

The third major faction was the Northern faction, with Uchida Ryohei as its sole figure. He masterminded the Northern Warlords, the restoration of Manchuria and Mongolia, and related issues. He founded the "Black Dragon Society." In recent decades, the "Production Party" within Japan originated from the Black Dragon Society. He advocated rapid military aggression against China and is still alive today. This is a systematic analysis of Japan's overall strategy of dividing China.

Second, Analysis Based on Political Philosophy

(I) Analysis of Japanese Thinking

There are three types of Japanese thinking: "Emperor Worship," "Emperor's Way," and "Fascism." "Emperor's Way" reveres the Emperor as God, Father, and Ruler, a trinity of supreme authority. The "God" aspect means that the Emperor is the incarnation of the god of the universe. The "Father" aspect means that all Japanese people are descendants of the Emperor. The "Ruler" aspect means that the Emperor has absolute control over Japanese national affairs and is the king of Japan. The latent power cultivated by this kind of thinking can widely pervade the people of the entire nation, deeply ingrained in the hearts of the people, grasping the entire spirit of the people. Therefore, Emperor worship and Fascism cannot be opposed, and must be unconditionally obeyed. Therefore, although the conspiracy of Fascism to seize political power is fierce and terrible, the Emperor system can still rely on the latent power of "Emperor's Way" to maintain itself.

"Emperor Worship" is the utmost sincerity and deep belief in the Emperor, believing that the Emperor is the incarnation of the god of the universe. Therefore, it is believed that Japan should advocate "Shintoism." As for "the Way of Kings" and "the Imperial Way," critical theories are dismissed as "the philosophy of the Chinese dynastic revolution." Although its origin is due to "Fascism," which is created for the purpose of seizing actual political power, its spirit of utmost respect for the Emperor is contrary to Fascism and stands in opposition to Fascism. Regarding the launching of political power, great respect is given to "the spirit of launching great power," so respect is given to vertical organization, and opposition to "Fascism" for horizontal organization is inevitable in theory and fact.

When "Fascism" launched the "September 18th Incident," "Emperor Worship" severely criticized this action of "Fascism" as "the impulsive movement of peripheral nerves" and attacked it as an action of "the lower ranks attacking the upper ranks." "Fascism" uses "Shinto" to create "Emperor Worship" to fool the military and civilians. Its respect for the Emperor is entirely false, using Emperor Worship to suppress the will of the people. Its purpose is to create a new shogunate, as an organ for it to grasp actual political power, to carry out its intention of "using the Emperor to command the nobles." Constitutionally, it relies on the "right to report to the Emperor from the inner circle" to infringe upon the Emperor's power. The content of the "right to report to the Emperor from the inner circle" stipulates that the Chief of the Naval General Staff, the Minister of the Navy, the Chief of the General Staff, and the Minister of the Army have the right to report directly to the Emperor without passing through the Cabinet, thus making the Cabinet lack unified power. However, in Japan, "where the latent power of the Emperor's Way is extremely broad, even though the means created by "Fascism" are extremely ingenious, it is unable to openly destroy the Emperor system, and the accusation of "the lower ranks attacking the upper ranks" used by "Emperor Worship," once it reaches a day when there is no way to hide it, "Fascism" will inevitably be sentenced to death by the latent power of the "Emperor's Way" under this accusation. This is what people who know the situation in Japan cannot deny.

(II) The Uniqueness of Japan

The uniqueness of Japan, namely "Emperor's Way," and the three kinds of thoughts encompassed by "Emperor's Way," have produced the special strengths and special weaknesses of Japanese uniqueness. The following is a brief discussion of its contents.

A special strength of Japanese uniqueness is "Unity."

A special weakness of Japanese uniqueness is "The Limitation of Nature."

What is "Unity"? "Unity" is the expression of "Obedience." According to the three kinds of thoughts encompassed by "Emperor's Way," the first thought is "The Emperor is God." The people of Japan believe that "the Emperor is the incarnation of the god of the universe," so the power of this kind of thought can make the people of Japan unanimously and automatically acknowledge from the bottom of their hearts and obey the "God," the Emperor of the universe, unconditionally. The second thought is "The Emperor is Father." The people of Japan believe that "the Japanese people are all descendants of the Emperor," so the power of this kind of thought can create the obligation to obey the Emperor as a natural duty, just as descendants obey their ancestors, which cannot be questioned. Therefore, there is only absolute obedience to the Emperor's will, and no discussion or suspicion can be added. If there is discussion or suspicion, it is "disloyalty," which in Japan is considered a great crime of disrespect and should be punished with extreme penalties. The third thought is "The Emperor is Ruler." The people of Japan believe that "the Emperor has the great power to exclusively control Japanese national affairs," which is naturally something that should be. Therefore, the power of this kind of thought can create the idea that Japan's national political power should be held by the Emperor, and the people can only offer unconditional obedience. Combining these two kinds of thoughts, it can be seen that the people of Japan unanimously obey the Emperor, and the spirit of obedience is extremely sincere. The "Unity" of Japanese uniqueness is created by the expression of this extremely sincere obedience. This principle is very obvious.

What is "The Limitation of Nature"? "The Limitation of Nature" is "No Expandability, No Capacity for Inclusion." It is based on the second thought of "Emperor's Way," "The Japanese are all descendants of the Emperor." This kind of thought is the Japanese themselves limiting the scope of their nation and country. As evidenced by the facts, the people of Korea, Taiwan, and even all the areas occupied by Japan are discriminated against because they do not have the same history, and Japan still cannot call them Japanese forever. This kind of natural limitation causes great obstacles to Japan's continental policy. This obstacle is obstructed by "No Capacity for Inclusion, No Expandability." The continental ambition of the Toyotomi Hideyoshi era could not be realized, and the continental ambitions of Saigo Takamori and Saigo Tsugumichi of the Meiji Restoration era failed, all due to this kind of congenital distress. Therefore, the special weakness of Japanese uniqueness is "The Limitation of Nature," which is "No Expandability, No Capacity for Inclusion."

The first thought of "Emperor's Way," "The Emperor is the incarnation of the god of the universe," makes Japan dream of conquering the world.

The second thought, "The Japanese are all descendants of the Emperor," yet does not allow its own nation to have "Inclusiveness" and "Expandability." "Fascism" dares to use the "Emperor Worship" thought to monopolize political power, creating a phenomenon of domestic division. These are all principles of why Japan will forever live in extreme painful contradiction.

Third, A Brief Description of Japanese Military Strategy and Tactics

Japanese military strategy and tactics have the same goals, but the methods of achieving those goals are different. In terms of military tactics, it advocates "first dividing China and then annexing it." In terms of strategy, when waging war against China, because of the various convenient relationships of "military economy" and "military administration" within China, it has to seek unification in the occupied areas of China. Division and unification are exactly the opposite, so in principle, Japan's military tactics and strategy contradict each other.

Before the European War, the purpose of military tactics, although also to annex China, its actions were divided into two major factions. The first faction advocated "Southern Advance," and the second faction advocated "Northern Advance." The so-called "Southern Advance" meant attacking the South while defending the North, first attacking Britain and then annexing China. The most vigorous advocate was the Navy. The so-called "Northern Advance" meant attacking the North while defending the South, first attacking Russia and then annexing China. The most vigorous advocate was the Army.

After the European War, the hypothetical enemy of military tactics was the Anglo-American alliance, so the content of military tactics changed to defensive attacks. In other words, first annex China and then fight against Britain and the United States, so its diplomatic policy changed with its military tactics, striving to alienate the Anglo-American alliance. Two years before the "September 18th" Incident, the profits Japan obtained from the European War had caused its expansionist forces to demand the satisfaction of its aggressive ambitions beyond its borders. Britain and the United States knew that Japan's ambitions could not be suppressed, and feared that it would invade their colonies, so they hinted that Japan could invade northeastern China. Northeastern China bordered Russia. After receiving this hint, Japan's considerations for invasion were the military equipment of Russia. However, according to the results of the investigation by the Japanese ambassador to Poland, who returned to Japan from Europe via Moscow, it was estimated that Russia's military equipment would take at least five years to be ready for external use. Moreover, at that time, Russia's Five-Year Economic Plan was gradually showing its success, which made Japan fear the military resistance strength after the success of the Soviet Five-Year Economic Plan, and thus quickly took advantage of the incomplete Five-Year Economic Plan of the Soviet Union to rapidly attack northeastern China.

Looking at the internal situation in China at that time, Japan also believed that at that time was the only opportunity in a thousand years for Japan to invade northeastern China. The internal situation in China at that time was extremely complex, and the complex nature of the internal strife was extremely deteriorated, changing from political internal strife to factional internal strife. The Enlarged Conference was the result of Zhang Xueliang's movement to enter the pass with troops under the instigation of Zhang Qun and Wu Tiecheng, attacking Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan, and then stationing troops in Beijing. All these facts of the deterioration of internal strife in China further caused Japan's ambition to occupy the Northeast by force to erupt rapidly. Therefore, Japan boldly created the "September 18th" Mukden Incident in 1931. At this time, Japan's military tactics were "first annexing China and then unifying the world." The "January 28th" Shanghai Incident in 1932 was merely a kind of containment plan for Japan at that time to contain the Chinese rescue troops from going north to resist, with no intention of large-scale occupation.

The munitions for Japan's attack on China from the "July 7th" Lugouqiao Incident in 1937 to the present have all been imported from the United States according to investigations. Therefore, the United States' hint that Japan should invade northeastern China is an undeniable fact, and Britain has also stated it clearly in Parliament. The dissatisfaction of Britain and the United States with Japan is also a fact. The reason is that Japan has now exceeded the scope of invasion initially indicated by Britain and the United States. As for Britain, although it is also deeply dissatisfied with Japan's expanding actions of invading northeastern China, like the United States, the tension in the European situation and the economic determinism of the financial capital forces represented by Prime Minister Chamberlain have made Britain powerless to turn eastward, and it has no choice but to shift with the attitude of the United States towards Japan. Therefore, the current oppression of Japan cannot be accomplished without the joint efforts of Britain and the United States. These are all the various considerations of Japan's military tactics of invading China.

Japan's "first dividing China and then annexing China" has been a consistent military tactic from Gotō Shinpei to the present, and has never changed slightly. Therefore, when the "September 18th" Incident attacked northeastern China, Japan negotiated with the Chinese government, calling it a local incident, which was to implement this technique of dividing China and defeating them one by one. This is completely contrary to its strategy.

In terms of strategy, Japan occupied the four northeastern provinces, established Manchuria, and then entered the pass to attack Beiping and Tianjin, attacking Shanghai in the east, and then Nanjing and Hankou, and attacking Guangzhou in the south. The commanders of its combat operations were also divided into North China, Central China, and South China, all of whom had no power to control each other. Therefore, in China's "military administration" and "military economy," there was often an inconvenience of lack of unity. Because those related to joint management must first jointly request instructions from Tokyo, and Tokyo must make the decision, so strategically, it must seek unification in the occupied areas of China. Therefore, the principles of Japanese military tactics and strategy are indeed two mutually contradictory and unchangeable factors.

### Important Organizations in This City Send Joint Telegrams in Support of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang

### All Resolutions are for Resistance and National Reconstruction; Advancing Bravely Without Hesitation; The Cultural Sector Also Sends a Joint Telegram of Congratulations

Important commercial and local organizations in this city sent joint telegrams yesterday in support of the upcoming Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Chongqing. The telegram was addressed to the entire body of Supervisors and Central Executive Committee Members of the Chinese Kuomintang in Chongqing, stating, "At a time when the guidelines for resistance and national reconstruction are being earnestly implemented and the national united front is being further consolidated, the grand opening of the Plenary Session is cause for celebration for all citizens of Shanghai. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, under the leadership of President Chiang, we have adhered to the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings, the revolutionary spirit of the Three Principles of the People, without compromise or surrender. Final victory is assured. The freedom and equality for China sought by the Premier will surely be achieved. All citizens of Shanghai wholeheartedly support the Plenary Session. All matters of resistance and national reconstruction are above all else, and all resolutions for resistance and national reconstruction will be supported at any cost. We will advance bravely without hesitation. We humbly submit this telegram with utmost sincerity."

A group of 154 prominent figures in Shanghai's cultural circles and more than 20 magazine publishers jointly issued four telegrams on the evening of the 19th. One was addressed to the Fifth Plenary Session, expressing support for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting the arrest of Wang Jingwei and the purging of wavering and compromising elements, and urging the enactment of methods to effectively guarantee freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association, uniting the nation's cultural circles. They appealed for a response to the telegram to the Plenary Session, uniting all overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, urging them to monitor the activities of Wang's faction, and urging all newspaper distributors in Hong Kong to refuse to distribute and sell the "South China Daily." The following is the telegram to the Fifth Plenary Session:

To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and all Central Committee members attending the Fifth Plenary Session in Chongqing:

As the War of Resistance enters a new phase, the enemy's difficulties deepen and our advantages increase. In the future, the way to victory is for politics to be considered more important than military affairs. The Fifth Plenary Session is being held at this opportune moment, and with the gathering of great minds, many insightful plans will surely be developed. We offer our sincere support to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and pay our respects to all the Central Committee members. We respectfully draw attention to two matters: (1) Wang Jingwei's treasonous surrender to the enemy is deeply resented by all our compatriots. The Central Provisional Conference on New Year's Day only removed him from the party and dismissed him from all positions, a lenient punishment. It was hoped that he would repent and find a path to redemption. However, Wang Jingwei's base nature has only intensified, and he has continued to issue fallacies, recklessly slandering and falsely claiming that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had also considered peace talks before the fall of Nanjing, attempting to confuse public opinion and cover up his own ugliness. At the same time, he dispatched his followers to carry out activities everywhere, determined to sell out the nation and the state. This is truly a crime deserving ten thousand deaths. We, who are engaged in news, education, art, and writing, serve the cause of resistance culture amidst the encirclement of tigers and wolves. Witnessing the enemy's military advance, we become more vigilant and motivated. Hearing of the traitor's conspiracy to harm the nation, we gnash our teeth in hatred. We have repeatedly read the telegrams from Generals Chen Cheng, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, and Yan Xishan, advocating for the arrest of Wang Jingwei and bringing him to justice. This is what we all desire. We earnestly urge the assembly to adopt the demands of the nation's military and civilians, enact a resolution, hand Wang Jingwei over to the National Government for arrest, and administer just punishment to deter evil, and purge those who willingly side with Wang, correcting wavering and compromising tendencies, in order to stabilize the source of chaos. (2) The freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association is already stipulated in the guidelines for resistance and national reconstruction and urgently needs to be implemented without reservation. We urge the assembly to enact methods to effectively guarantee these freedoms in order to enhance the public's spontaneous interest in participating in the resistance. We eagerly await your response.

### Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday

### Expected to Arrive in Wuhu Today

Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, and U.S. Consul General to Shanghai Gauss, along with their party, departed Shanghai aboard the U.S. gunboat "Isabel" on the morning of the 18th to inspect the situation on the Yangtze River. They arrived in Nanjing yesterday morning (the 20th) and are expected to reach Wuhu today.

### Injury of British Nationals at Kuling Denied by Japanese

According to the "Continental News," during a reception for reporters hosted by the Japanese side last night (the 19th), a question was raised regarding the "Several British People Endangering All Foreigners in the Summer Resort" report from the Japanese Domei News Agency on Wednesday (the 18th). The Japanese spokesman was unable to confirm this. The spokesman was also unable to confirm the report of Japanese aircraft bombing near Kuling and injuring a British national. However, the spokesman believed that because there are large numbers of Chinese troops around Mount Lu, there have been some Japanese activities recently. As for the activities of British nationals contacting Chinese guerrilla units, which was claimed by the Japanese naval spokesman at the beginning of last month, the spokesman said that he had heard at that time that some British nationals were working with Chinese people, but he had not heard any follow-up news since then. When asked if Admiral Yarnell and U.S. Consul General Gauss requested to investigate the situation of foreigners still staying in Kuling, would the Japanese side provide all conveniences, the spokesman replied that such a request would cause a difficult situation because the Chinese army is currently fighting the Japanese army near Mount Lu, making the investigation difficult, as any investigation group must pass through the front line. It is said that a large-scale battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies is currently underway around Mount Lu.

### Japanese Troops in Western Shanghai Are Busy with Conscription

### Bloody Battle on the Hangzhou-Fuyang Road is Extended

### Wounded Japanese Soldiers Are Unwilling to Depart

A fierce battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies is ongoing along the Hangzhou-Fuyang Road near Yufu. The fighting is particularly intense in Zhuantang and Lingjiaqiao, both located approximately 40 li from Hangzhou. The Japanese headquarters in western Shanghai has been mobilizing a large number of troops and military supplies for several days, loading them onto 300 vehicles. It is estimated that the number of troops is at least around two to three thousand, heading to Hangzhou along the "Shanghai-Hangzhou Line" (renamed after being occupied by the Japanese). At the same time, many crippled and wounded soldiers have been brought back from the front lines to rear hospitals in the Hongqiao Wujia Lane area for treatment. Chinese people are being forced to carry the corpses of Japanese soldiers along the way, with each person being paid 400 cash per day. More than 600 recovered wounded soldiers have been transported by military vehicles to the front lines. Before departure, a Matsui Comfort Mission visited the wounded soldiers, but the wounded soldiers were unwilling to depart and cried bitterly. It is heard that soldiers of the Qingchuan Unit of the Japanese Army in Liujia committed suicide upon hearing the news of their deployment. Their war-weary mentality can be seen from this.

### Seven Installments of Principal Repayment for Consolidated Bonds

### Regular Lottery Draw

### Government Determined to Maintain Creditworthiness

### All Prices in the Market Rebounded Yesterday

In order to maintain its creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has always repaid its domestic and foreign debts on schedule, without delay, which has earned the trust of bondholders. This time, the notification that customs-guaranteed debts would no longer be advanced was due to the seizure of customs revenue, so bondholders had no objection. As for the five types of consolidated bonds (A, B, C, D, and E) due this month, the head office of the Central Bank has been ordered to advance the funds as usual, only changing the payment to be made in full in Chongqing. As for the seventh lottery draw for the repayment of principal of the Consolidated National Bonds, the National Debt Fund Management Committee will hold it as usual on February 10th. The Ministry of Finance's determination to maintain creditworthiness is further evident.

### Japanese Side Raises Coercive Conditions for the Restoration of Branch Customs Offices in Various War Zones

### Demands that Japanese Nationals be Appointed as Senior Customs Officers

### Robert F. Smith is Currently Seeking Instructions from the Inspector General of Customs

According to "Modern News," after the war, the Jianghai Customs has been subject to unreasonable interference from the Japanese side in its administration due to the environment. The British Customs Commissioner Robert F. Smith had previously negotiated with the Japanese side, requesting the restoration of the powers of the branch customs offices in various war zones, but without result. Recently, the old matter has been raised again, and the Japanese side has actually proposed to increase the employment of senior Japanese officials as an exchange condition. This matter has been discussed concretely, and the "Modern News" reporter has recorded the details as follows:

Restoring Branch Customs Offices and Increasing the Employment of Japanese Personnel

The Japanese side, after holding the revenue of Jianghai Customs, found that the tax revenue had sharply decreased due to the failure to restore the customs powers in various places. Apart from monthly repayment of foreign debts, there was no surplus to be gained. The Japanese side was disappointed by this. Recently, because the customs authorities have repeatedly negotiated the restoration of the powers of the branch customs offices in various war zones, they believe that if the tax revenue can be sufficient, it may not be without benefit to the Japanese side, so they have proposed conditions to the customs: senior principal personnel in various branch customs offices in the war zone must be filled by Japanese nationals. All matters of inspection, reporting, and seizing tax evasion should also be dominated by Japanese personnel. The rest should be assisted by the original customs officers still appointed by the customs. This coercion of the Japanese side also has its significant effect. The Customs is currently seeking instructions from the Inspector General of Customs, Mei Jinshi, through Robert F. Smith.

Chinese Officials Oppose, Foreign Nationals Remain Silent

In recent days, it has been rumored that Jianghai Customs will increase the employment of a large number of Japanese personnel. According to customs news yesterday, this matter may be realized. The Chinese officials are very dissatisfied with this, believing that if the branch customs offices are restored in this way, the customs powers will be entirely dominated by the Japanese, which is tantamount to destroying the integrity of the administration. Therefore, the Chinese officials have decided to take an opposing stance and are unwilling to return to work. As for the foreign nationals of various countries, they are currently taking a wait-and-see attitude and have not expressed anything.

### British Ambassador to Depart for Tianjin on Schedule

### Will Remain for Two Weeks Before Returning to Shanghai

British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr is scheduled to depart for Tianjin with his wife and private secretary, T. Huband, on the Taikoo steamship on January 28th, and will return to Shanghai approximately two weeks later.

### Representatives of the "Collapse Cart" Association Petition the Shanghai Municipal Council

### Requesting General Order to All Police Stations

### Not to Detain Unlicensed Carts for the Time Being

The Shanghai "Collapse Cart" Mutual Aid Association, due to incidents of members' vehicles being detained, once again sent representatives Zou Shisong, Ke Huaxin, Gao Youyu, and the Director-General Ge Futian, to the Shanghai Municipal Council to petition yesterday. Deputy Secretary-General De Kui and others received them. The representatives presented everything in person and submitted a petition letter.

### Japanese Acquisition of Rice in Production Areas Affects Shanghai's Food Supply; Difficult to Stop Under Special Influences

The Shanghai Rice and Bean Trade Association, in order to regulate Shanghai's food supply, is doing its utmost to find ways to dredge the sources and stabilize rice prices in the market. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Rice and Bean Trade that the stock of rice in Shanghai, including various warehouses and firms, totals more than 700,000 *shi*. Therefore, there is no risk of shortage in the recent days. The price of first-class rice is twelve yuan and six *jiao* per *shi*. As for areas within the war zone, such as Wuhu, Baimao, Hupu, Changshu, Wuxi, Songjiang, Qingpu, etc., due to the large-scale purchases by Japanese merchants, prices in the producing areas have risen. First-class white rice has risen to nine yuan and three *jiao*. It is heard that the rice purchased by Japanese merchants is transported to Qingdao and various parts of North China. The total data is estimated to be as high as one million *shi*. If this continues, the inventory in the producing areas will gradually decrease, which will inevitably affect the food supply of Shanghai. Rice merchants are paying close attention to this matter, but under the special influence of the Japanese army, it is feared that it will be difficult to stop their purchases. For example, the rice in Songjiang has been almost entirely purchased by Japanese merchants.

### Relief Association Carries Out Fundraising from the Wealthy; Excellent Results from Hometown Appeals

Regarding the Refugees Relief Association's fundraising from the wealthy, a circular was sent to all members of the association yesterday, stating: "We hereby inform you that the fundraising by various groups in our association is already actively underway. However, the wealthy group has not yet started. Now, we intend to invite all members of our association to act with a sincere heart for disaster relief and provide examples of people they know, including the names, origins, addresses, etc., of wealthy individuals in the same industry or from the same hometown, before the end of this month. Please consider and disclose this information so that our association can use it as a basis for fundraising. If there are results in the future, it will be indirectly due to your great contribution. This is specially announced to await your reply."

Since its establishment, the Hometown Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugees Relief Association has actively promoted the fundraising work of various hometown organizations and urged fundraising teams to carry out their work separately. For example, the team leaders appointed by the Ningbo Fellow Association have achieved excellent results in recent days. More than 10,300 yuan has been successively sent to the Relief Association, and another 5,000 yuan was handed over yesterday. A few days ago, the Wujiang Fellow Association celebrated the joint birthday of three gentlemen from the county living in Shanghai: Su Qiannian, Ling Wenzhi, and Zhou Xinmei. All 400 yuan of the saved banquet money has also been transferred to the association as a donation. All these have been registered by the association. The Hui Ning Fellow Association formally established a fundraising team yesterday and began its work. Other hometown organizations are also actively organizing and are expected to announce their establishment in the near future. It is expected that the fundraising results from all parties will be considerable.

### Weirich Han Company's "New Anna" Ship Detained in Ningbo; Due to Shipment of Goods Not Approved by the Ministry; Ship's Representatives Sent to Jinhua to Request Release

The American Weirich Han Company's "New Anna" ship sailed to Taiwan and then Ningbo for the first time on the 15th. Because the registration procedures have not been completed, it has been detained in Ningbo, and the goods are not allowed to be unloaded. The Lehe Foreign Company's "Mofu" ship was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo yesterday morning, but due to cargo loading reasons, it was changed to 9:00 am this morning. The Sino-Italian Company's "Ender" ship returned directly to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday and will arrive this morning. It is scheduled to sail to Wenzhou and then Ningbo the day after tomorrow. The "Deping" ship will arrive successively tomorrow. The details are recorded as follows:

Reasons for Anna's Detention

After the Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities approved the American Weirich Han Company's four ships to sail on the Zhejiang Eastern routes, the "New Anna" ship leased by the company (formerly named "Anna" and owned by Tailai Shipping Company) planned to set sail first. It was originally scheduled to sail to Taiwan and then Ningbo on the afternoon of the 13th of this month. However, due to the incomplete procedures, it was changed to the afternoon of the 14th. But temporarily, it was postponed to 4:00 am the next morning before it was finally decided to set sail. After the ship arrived at Haimen, it sailed to Ningbo and arrived at the Yong River on the 18th. After inspection by the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters, it was found that although the ship had been approved to sail on the Shanghai-Taiwan-Ningbo route, it had not yet submitted for approval what goods were loaded. (According to the navigation method promulgated by the commander of the Tenth Army Group, in addition to the approved route, special cargo ships must also obtain certification from the Property Adjustment Office for the local products loaded and submit them to the ministry for approval before they can set sail.) It was actually sailing without authorization, which was a violation of regulations and orders. Therefore, the ship was immediately detained and not allowed to sail, and the unloading of goods was prohibited. The ship has telegraphed the situation to the Shanghai headquarters and sent personnel to Jinhua to explain and request permission to return to avoid accidental losses.

Mofu Sails to Ningbo This Morning

The Lehe Foreign Company's "Mofu" ship has been approved by the authorities to sail on the Shanghai-Wenzhou-Taiwan route and has been designated by the Ningbo Property Adjustment Office to load silkworm cocoons. It has already sailed four times. After the ship arrived in Shanghai on the 18th, it was originally scheduled to sail to Wenzhou and then Ningbo at 10:00 am yesterday. Due to the cargo loading exceeding the rated tonnage, customs clearance procedures were temporarily handled, resulting in insufficient time. It was decided to postpone it to 9:00 am this morning. Also, Sino-Italian Company's "Ender" and "Deping", after being approved to sail to Ningbo and designated to load cotton, have successively set sail. The company received a telegram from Ningbo yesterday stating that the "Ender" ship had returned directly to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday and will arrive this morning. It is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou and then Ningbo the day after tomorrow. The "Deping" ship is scheduled to return directly to Shanghai tomorrow (the 22nd) and will arrive the day after tomorrow morning. After unloading the goods, it will continue to sail on the Shanghai-Wenzhou-Ningbo route.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Considers Staff Treatment Issues; Committee to Study Everything

The English "North China Daily News" stated that letters criticizing the Shanghai Municipal Council's salary increase and the establishment of the Ratepayers' Investigation Committee and the convening of the general meeting have prompted the Council to take action. However, it is still impossible to predict whether a new report on salary increases and decreases will be published. If there is such a report, it will not be welcomed by the public, because the public does not want to see complicated calculations, but clear and understandable documents. This reporter visited Mr. Philip, the secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Council, this morning (the 20th) and asked whether the Council has taken any action in response to this protest. Mr. Philip replied that he had nothing to answer on this matter, only that the senior authorities had decided to issue a statement or reply, which would be announced soon. Mr. Stewart, the secretary of the Investigation Committee, broadcast on a radio station last night, refuting the Council's statement that senior officials had a 60% salary increase, saying that senior officials actually had an 80% salary increase, while some junior officials only had a 3% increase. He also said that the previous rumor that the salary increase would cost 100,000 yuan per year was not accurate. According to his estimate, it will reach 1 million yuan. He finally asked taxpayers to prepare to attend a special meeting of taxpayers.

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Civil Service Committee passed a resolution on December 23 last year (Friday) to approve the council employees’ remittance allowance and living allowance. The public has criticized this resolution. In view of this, the council has decided to invite representatives from the business community to form a committee. The task of this committee is to review the aforementioned allowance method and report to the Municipal Council. According to the committee's opinion, the method is justified, and if it is considered inappropriate, how should it be modified? As for the candidates for the members of the committee, it is expected to be announced soon.

The "Shanghai Times" stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council recently readjusted the exchange rate and formulated a plan to increase the salaries of senior officials. A senior member of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association opposed it yesterday (the 19th). It is said that the association does not intend to take any formal action on this matter, but hopes that the council's administration will handle all matters with fairness as its guiding principle. The association will handle all issues that affect the welfare of the entire Chinese ratepayers without fear. However, it will not take action on the council's new salary distribution, because it calls this the Shanghai Municipal Council's "internal affair," only related to the council employees. However, if the Chinese employees in the council believe that this new distribution is unfair to them and appeal to the Ratepayers' Association, the association will take possible actions to help them. But so far, the association has not received such an appeal, and it is believed that there will be no such appeal in the future. The reason is obviously that the leaders of the employees who complain of unfairness will oppose this move. The rise in the cost of living affects everyone, so the salaries of Shanghai Municipal Council employees should not be discriminated against. The person also hinted that the Chinese ratepayers are about to hold a meeting, and the issue of the council's unequal salary distribution may be raised for important discussion.

### New Consul in Medan, Ji Tifan, Takes Office

Ji Tifan, the newly appointed consul in Medan and former chief of the First Section of the Intelligence Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, immediately came to Shanghai to prepare his luggage after receiving the order to be transferred. He left Shanghai with his wife and son the other day to take up his new post in Medan.

### Portuguese Deputy Consul Transferred; Successor's Name Not Announced

The English "North China Daily News" stated that it has been announced that Mr. Alves, the Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai, has been transferred to be the Consul General in New York, and the Deputy Consul, Mr. Monteiro, has been transferred to be the Portuguese Consul in Guangzhou. However, the date of their departure from Shanghai and the name of their successor have not been announced.

### Bandits Arrested in Zikawei Not Yet Returned by Japanese Side; Police Cannot Prosecute in Court; Japanese Side Claims Bandits Participated in Guerrilla Activities

The "Shanghai Times" reported that personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Police arrested ten male and female bandits in Zikawei, believing that they were the perpetrators of robbery cases in western Shanghai. Two weeks have passed, but the police still cannot prosecute these bandits as usual. According to regulations, the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters on Great Western Road would have transferred them to the police within 24 hours of their arrest, but the Japanese side allowed interrogation for a week, and then returned them to the Japanese side on January 12. Since then, negotiations have been underway for the police to detain them so that they can be prosecuted in the Special Court. As of yesterday (the 19th), the bandits are still in the hands of the Japanese side. According to the Japanese Gendarmerie, it is necessary to investigate their activities and determine whether they have participated in guerrilla activities.

### City United Relief Association Holds Clothing and Rice Distribution; Fundraising Through Broadcasting; Relieving Refugees on the Streets

The Refugee Relief Committee of the Municipal First Special District Citizens' Federation, in view of the recent cold winter weather, the refugees sleeping on the streets are still visible everywhere by the *li* chiefs. Without warm clothes or enough to eat, they are crying in pain. They have initiated a fundraising movement through the radio station and distribute clothing and rice. The methods are as follows: (1) The goal of our association's distribution of clothing and rice to refugees on the streets is 5,000 cotton clothes and 500 *dan* of white rice. (2) The strength of our association for this clothing and rice distribution movement is limited, and we hope that all sectors of society will support it. Therefore, it is scheduled to hold a three-day broadcasting promotion at the radio station starting on January 25, to speak for the refugees, and invite famous actors, actresses, singers, dancers, stars, comedians, and storytellers to join the conference and sing. (3) According to the above-mentioned goals, our association has specially printed 5,000 clothing tickets and 50,000 rice tickets to solicit donations from all sectors of society. Those who donate one yuan and three *jiao* can purchase a cotton clothing ticket (one ticket per piece), and those who donate one yuan and two *jiao* can purchase ten rice tickets (one *sheng* per ticket). The rest can be deduced by analogy. In addition to our association sending personnel directly to various roads and lanes to distribute them to refugees before January 30, donors who purchase clothing or rice tickets can also distribute them to refugees themselves.

### Fujian Construction Public Bonds Pledged for Three Million Yuan; Temporary in Nature to Meet Urgent Needs; Fundraising of Four Million Yuan from Overseas Chinese

The Fujian Provincial Government issued 8 million yuan of the 27th Year of the Republic Construction Public Bonds on October 1 last year. In order to cope with the emergency, the provincial government first pledged 3 million yuan in national currency from the Central and China Banks. This is temporary in nature. On the one hand, a fundraising method is being formulated to raise 4 million yuan within the province, and the remaining 4 million yuan is raised from overseas Chinese. The Minister of Finance, Zhang Guo, was sent to various parts of Southeast Asia to raise funds. However, the overseas Chinese in Fujian are eager to help their hometowns. In the midst of all kinds of difficulties, they are still doing their best to donate money to relieve the poverty of their hometown. Regarding the purchase of construction public bonds, it was decided that the overseas Chinese in Fujian in the Philippines, Annam, Burma, and the Dutch colonies would be responsible for one million yuan, and the overseas Chinese in Fujian in Malaya would be responsible for one million yuan. In the Philippines, the Fujian Relief Association had existing deposits of more than 200,000 yuan, and then raised it to 300,000 yuan. The Annam, Burma, and Dutch colonies will then be responsible for 700,000 yuan. In Malaya, the Singapore Fujian Association plans to be shared by twelve ports, including Singapore 350,000 yuan, Johor 150,000 yuan, Kuala Lumpur 100,000 yuan, Perak 100,000 yuan, Penang 100,000 yuan, Malacca 60,000 yuan, Negeri Sembilan 40,000 yuan, Pahang 35,000 yuan, Klang 30,000 yuan, Kedah 30,000 yuan, Kelantan 20,000 yuan, and Terengganu 15,000 yuan.

### World Christian Evangelization Conference Discusses Morality Moving the World; More Than Seventy Countries Sympathize with China's War of Resistance; Conference Donates Money to Relieve Chinese Refugees

The World Christian Evangelization Conference was held at Tambaram, Madras, India, on December 12 last year. The conference lasted for 17 days, and more than 470 representatives from more than 70 countries around the world attended. Forty-seven Chinese representatives were sent by the Christian churches in Shanghai and Hong Kong. It is heard that the purpose of this conference was purely because the Christian churches of various countries around the world, in view of the outbreak of war in the Far East between China and Japan and in the West between Spain, and the invasion of the two countries by militarist countries, all civilians are spending their days in sorrow and suffering. Therefore, taking advantage of the Evangelization Conference, Mr. Mudd, the chairman of the American Christian Church, served as the chairman of the conference and proposed discussions to find a remedy and to use morality to confuse the world to seek permanent peace. At the conference, representatives from more than 70 countries expressed their deep sympathy for China's decision to launch a full-scale war of resistance and the massacre of civilians. Thousands of yuan were donated on the spot to relieve Chinese refugees. The money has been returned to the Chinese government. Another said that the World Christian Evangelization Conference discussed how to go deep into the Chinese interior to help General Chiang Kai-shek and relieve the Chinese refugees. The conference also planned to send representatives to appeal for peace to Britain and the United States. Wu Yifang, Jiang Changchuan, Chen Wenyuan, and other 17 representatives from Shanghai returned to Shanghai on the Italian ship Victoria after the conference closed on December 29 last year.

The "Continental News" stated that the International Church Conference held in India in December last year passed a resolution calling on Christians around the world to donate funds to engage in relief work in China and to help Chinese refugees. Mr. Lin (translated), the general secretary of the National Committee of the China YMCA, told reporters that one of the most moving events at the conference was the excitement and optimism of the Chinese delegation, which always expressed the greatest confidence in China's future during the meeting, which even convinced the Japanese delegation. The Japanese delegation had no action during the 17 days of the meeting. When asked whether the Sino-Japanese dispute was discussed during the meeting, Mr. Lin replied that no formal meeting was convened to study the issue of the Sino-Japanese war, but the general principles for dealing with international relations were discussed in several meetings. At the same time, the constant invitation of the Chinese delegation by the delegations of various countries shows that the participants were all eager to obtain direct information on the situation in the Far East. After the Chinese delegation held informal meetings with the delegations of various countries, they should be able to understand the disputes between China and Japan. According to the publications of the conference, at a meeting of the conference, it praised Mr. and Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek for leading China to fight. The conference made a global broadcast on Christmas Day, and Ms. Zeng, a member of the delegation, also broadcast a speech. Ms. Zeng and several other representatives have now set off for Britain and the United States to give speeches. According to reports, 15 of the 47 members of the Chinese delegation have returned to Shanghai, and the rest are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the Italian cruise ship Conte Verde.

### Severe Flooding in Northern Jiangsu; Hometown Associations Urgently Appeal; Protection Plan Has Been Drawn Up; Fundraising to Repair the Seawall

Last summer, the Yellow River dike collapsed and the flood invaded south, flooding Tong and Anhui, overflowing into the Liyun River in northern Jiangsu, and from Yundong and Chexin Erba, along the stream to the area of ​​the Guoyun River, all the fields and houses in Yancheng, Xinghua, Dongtai, Gaoyou, and Taixian were submerged. The water was several feet high, and the people were displaced. The water level on the dam was more than two meters high and has lasted for four months. It is now winter, and the water level is falling, but it has not decreased slightly.

In the spring and summer of this year, it will inevitably be like a high house building and it will not be possible to defend it. The rise of the Yellow and Huai Rivers is even more unimaginable. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial General Association, in order to prevent problems before they occur, advocates taking advantage of the winter water drying up and the breach is only more than 300 meters, prepare funds and materials as soon as possible, measure the terrain, quickly open a diversion river, force the flow into the main river, close the breach, and then the provinces downstream can handle the dredging of accumulated water, repair the embankment, and protect the lives of millions of victims after the catastrophe. Carved has solidified

Defensive Plan

Calling by telegram, the fellow villagers of Changshu and Taicang in Shanghai also jointly petitioned the chairman of the province, Han Deqin, to order the coastal township offices to raise funds to repair the seawall. It is estimated that 9,500 cubic meters of earthwork should be repaired in the Changshu section and 67,660 cubic meters of earthwork should be repaired in the Taicang section to protect the lives and properties of the people in more than ten counties in Jiangnan. A few days ago, Yang Shoumei, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Relief Association, visited Shanghai on the 15th of this month because of the poor soil in the eight counties of Xuzhou, Gangshan, Suqian, Donghai, Ganyu, Shuyang, Pei, Pi, and Xiao, and the heavy military disasters, making it difficult for the people to survive. In addition to reporting the disaster situation to the fellow villagers' associations, he also discussed how to provide relief to save the survivors.

### Samples for the Kinmen Expo Depart; A Group of Representatives Go by Ship; All Sectors are Preparing to Participate

The Kinmen Expo of 1939 is proceeding very smoothly after active preparations. Regarding the Chinese exhibition section, Dr. Kuang Yunyin has come to China to be responsible for liaison. Major industrial and commercial factories in this city are willing to do their best to support it. Dozens of merchants have already participated, including Wing On, Sincere, Commercial Press, China, Tianchu, and China National Products Company. Yesterday, a group of representatives took samples for display and left Shanghai on the Pias ship to prepare for the layout. At that time, in order to promote the culture and art of our country, the conference will set up a cinema and a Peking opera theater to introduce our country's dramas and films to European and American people.

### Celebrating Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Centennial Birthday; Fudan Alumni Association Prepares to Hold a Birthday Dinner

Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a member of the National Government Committee, is highly respected and admired by the whole country. This year is his centennial birthday, and all parties are planning to celebrate. The Shanghai Fudan Alumni Association believes that Mr. Ma is the founder of Fudan and should warmly celebrate.

### Notice to Passengers Traveling to Hong Kong and Manila; First-Class Tickets Do Not Require Vaccination Certificates; Third-Class Passengers Have Other Restrictions

The English "North China Daily News" stated that Dr. Jordan of the Health Department of the Municipal Council told reporters (the 20th) morning that first-class passengers traveling to Hong Kong and Manila do not need a photo and a Shanghai vaccination certificate upon entry, because this rule currently only applies to third-class passengers. The rules of Hong Kong and Manila differ on this matter, so the situation is slightly complicated. The Hong Kong health authorities require the vaccination certificates of third-class passengers to be stamped with the seal of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Other than third-class passengers, certificates issued by any well-known doctor in this port are considered sufficient proof of vaccination for passengers. However, the vaccination certificates of the Shanghai Municipal Council prepared by third-class passengers in Manila must be attached with a photo of the vaccinated person, and only certificates issued by certain doctors in Shanghai are valid. The offices of various shipping companies in this port have lists of the names of these doctors. However, other than third-class passengers, those traveling to Manila do not need a photo. The reason why the two ports promulgated these rules is because some doctors in this port illegally charged high fees to issue false certificates to third-class passengers. It is also understood that neither Hong Kong nor Manila requires a quarantine certificate anymore.

### Chinese Businessmen Electrical Workers Demand Back Pay of Bonuses, File for Relief Lawsuit with the Second Special Court

The Nanshi Chinese Businessmen Electrical Company, due to the cessation of business after the war, had dismissed all employees and paid them two-thirds of their bonus. The remaining one-third was promised to be paid upon the company's resumption of operations. Now, these employees, having been unemployed for over a year and facing destitution, and with the company having resumed a portion of its business in Xujiahui last year, requested the factory to fulfill its promise. They submitted a petition to the Second Special Court for mediation, which yielded no results. The workers have now filed a lawsuit with the court seeking relief, the original petition of which is recorded below: The plaintiffs are bringing this action as the defendant has unreasonably refused to pay the bonuses due to them. They sought mediation without success, and now petition the court to order payment in accordance with the law. Further, the plaintiffs are unable to pay the costs of this lawsuit, and request that they be granted relief for this action. The plaintiffs hereby state the purpose of the requested judgment and the reasons for seeking relief separately below:

They seek a judgment ordering the defendant to pay the collective bonus of eight thousand three hundred ninety-nine yuan and nine jiao in national currency for one-third of the year twenty-six. They also seek a judgment declaring provisional execution, with the defendant to bear the costs of litigation. The reason is that the plaintiffs were employees hired by the defendant. Each year, at the end of the year, the defendant paid the plaintiffs two months' salary as a bonus for their high merit and hard work throughout the year. At the end of last year, the defendant paid two-thirds of the bonus, with the remaining one-third promised to be paid when the company resumed operations and had profit income (a detailed calculation is attached in the exhibit column). Unexpectedly, the defendant has already resumed company operations (the defendant's business license is attached to the file). Despite repeated written requests from the plaintiffs for payment, the defendant ignored them. Forced by circumstances, they applied to the honorable court for mediation in accordance with the law. The defendant sent his son, lawyer Zhu Yisheng, to appear at the third hearing. Besides acknowledging that his father, the defendant, was the legal representative of the Chinese Businessmen Electrical Company, he denied that the company had resumed operations, using empty words to delay the matter and cause the plaintiffs to starve to death, becoming aggrieved ghosts. Fortunately, the facts and supporting documents are attached to the file as evidence, and the defendant cannot use any cunning or delay. The plaintiffs' usual meager wages are barely enough to make ends meet. Having suffered this robbery of over a year, they are facing extreme hunger and cold in this severe winter, which is a matter of life and death for the plaintiffs. The defendant, in the position of a wealthy person who does not understand the suffering of the poor, still attempts to use delaying tactics. They request that the honorable court grant its grace and immediately issue a judgment ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiffs the aforementioned request (remainder omitted).

### Superintendent's Farewell for Riding Police in the Public Works Bureau

The "North China Daily News" reports that Mr. Guttersmith, Deputy Superintendent of the Riding Police of the Police Department, has resigned and retired after 12 years of service. His colleagues in the Police Department and foreign friends held a farewell gathering yesterday (the 19th). Police Chief Purvis, representing his friends, presented Mr. Guttersmith with a watch engraved with an inscription and a suitcase at the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and delivered a farewell speech. It is reported that Mr. Edgar, the current Deputy Chief of the Riding Police, will succeed Mr. Guttersmith. The team currently has 35 mounted police officers and 44 horses.

### Increased Penalties for Failing to Affix Stamps During Extraordinary Times - Fines Increased Up to Sixty Times - Merchants and the Public Should Not Evade Obligations

The National Government's financial authorities, deeply gratified that the Shanghai public cherished national taxes and were still able to automatically affix stamps under these special circumstances, have stipulated temporary measures for stamp duty penalties during extraordinary times in response to a small number of merchants and citizens who do not understand the greater good, or who deliberately fail to issue invoices and receipts, or who, despite issuing invoices, do not affix stamps, or who, despite purchasing stamps, do not use them in accordance with regulations, which is not the behavior expected of citizens. The original punishment stipulated by the tax law, a fine of ten to thirty times the tax payable, has been changed to twenty to sixty times. Furthermore, the minimum fine amount under the original tax law, which was three yuan, has been increased to five yuan. Moreover, the original tax law stipulated that the combined penalty amount could not exceed three times the fine for the most serious offense. This has been changed to six times, as a warning to those who evade obligations during extraordinary times. Regarding penalties for tax evasion on account books and receipts, there was originally no time limit. Receipts issued currently, if not stamped, are still subject to penalties if discovered three or five years later.

### Skewed Development in Western Shanghai Leads to Increased Insurance Premiums - Public Works Bureau Lacks Initiative - Heavy Burden on Factories

The English newspaper "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that the Public Works Bureau lacks initiative and allows the vast areas of Western Shanghai to remain out of control. As a result, fire insurance companies in this port have recently announced an increase in insurance premiums for properties located between the boundary of the main body of the Public Settlement and the defense zone. After the westward shift of the war two years ago, vacant land in Western Shanghai was quickly filled with houses and factories within a few months. However, it was not until a major fire occurred that the attention of all parties concerned was drawn, such as the major fire at Wangjia Lane in Western Shanghai on December 4, where hundreds of small workshops were destroyed and several people were burned to death. Typically, insurance premiums range from 1.5 per thousand to 4 per thousand, depending on the building and other factors, and sometimes even 7 or 8 per thousand. Now, they have increased by a quarter. Therefore, residents of the western district have added this small expense, in addition to electricity and other costs.

### Embezzlement by Bank Employees - Appeal Concluded - Sentencing Scheduled for the 25th

Che Maoliang, a native of Ningbo, 25 years old, was a bookkeeper in the current account and savings department of the Nanshi Sixteen Pu branch of the China General Commercial Bank. After the outbreak of war two years ago, the branch moved and merged with the branch next to the Grand World Entertainment Center on Edward Road. However, starting in October of last year, he colluded with Xu Xingbei, a trainee at the bank, to underreport or overreport customer deposits and withdrawals,

Embezzling and Sharing the Loot

Totaling over four thousand eight hundred yuan. The bank manager, Yu Shouchun, discovered this and reported it to the French Concession Police. Xu had already fled upon hearing the news, and only Che was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court. The administrative authorities of the French Concession filed a public prosecution against him for embezzlement, and the plaintiff, Yu Shouchun, also hired lawyer Zuo Detao to represent him and filed an ancillary civil suit seeking to recover the embezzled funds.

Trial Results

The court sentenced Che Maoliang to one year and six months of imprisonment, and the ancillary civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial. The civil suit portion has already been settled with Che's guarantor responsible for compensation. Che expressed dissatisfaction with the criminal verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, Wu Daqi, the presiding judge of the criminal division of the Third Branch of the High Court, together with Chen Daqi and Wang Yue, and prosecutor Tan Xinzhen, held a collegial court to hear the case. According to the appellant, Che Maoliang,

Reasons for Appeal

He stated, "I was in charge of bookkeeping, and Xu Xingbei was in charge of controlling the receipts. I recorded based on the receipts. All the embezzlement was done by Xu. I had no authority to embezzle. I request a clear investigation." Subsequently, the plaintiff's, i.e., the agent for the ancillary civil suit, lawyer Zuo Detao, stated, "The civil suit portion of this case has already been settled. I request that the defendant be treated leniently and given a chance to rehabilitate himself." The court verified the statements and, finding the case clear, ordered closing arguments and announced the conclusion of the trial. Sentencing is scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 25th, and the appellant remains in custody pending further instructions.

### Two Hand Grenades Found in Naval YMCA Dormitory - Turns Out They Were Souvenirs and Could Not Explode - Left Behind by Traveler Pelouse When Returning to America

The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that two unexploded hand grenades were found in a room at the Naval YMCA this morning (the 20th). The room was previously occupied by an American named Pelouse. After the servant discovered the hand grenades, he immediately reported to the manager, who inspected other unoccupied rooms and questioned the servants. It was claimed that until recently, the room was occupied by Pelouse, and the manager hurriedly reported to the police department. The servant then recalled that Pelouse often came and went at irregular times in the past, and believed that the two grenades were deliberately left behind by Pelouse at the YMCA. The manager frowned at this opinion, unable to understand the reason. Personnel from the police department arrived shortly and went straight into the room. All the staff of the YMCA also followed in, and the atmosphere was quite tense. However, after inspection by the police department personnel, it was learned that the hand grenades could not explode, and everyone was relieved. Subsequently, a certain servant recalled a conversation with Pelouse, in which Pelouse said that these were souvenirs. However, when Pelouse left for America, the servant forgot to put the two grenades in his luggage, which led to this false alarm.

### Woman Who Advertised for a Husband in Newspaper Suddenly Accuses Husband of Enticement to Illicit Relations - Rift Suddenly Arises After More Than a Year of Cohabitation - Both Parties Talked Privately for a Long Time When Appearing in Court - Conflicting Statements from Both Parties Result in Rescheduling of Trial

On September 6, 1937, a classified advertisement for a spouse was published in a certain newspaper in this port, stating, "Lady, in her twenties, graduated from medical school, with a noble profession, suspended due to the war, now seeking someone who can provide economic support. Sincere individuals please write. If suitable, we will meet. If not suitable, the letter will be returned." At that time, Qi Liyuan (31 years old), a native of Jiangyin and owner of the Liyuan Well Drilling Factory at 596 Haifang Road, saw the advertisement and

Sent a Letter to Arrange a Meeting

He learned that the woman's name was Cheng Ying, a native of Taicang, 23 years old at the time, and a doctor residing at 101 Singapore Road. After several negotiations, he was deemed suitable and became her intimate companion. Unexpectedly, a rift suddenly arose after cohabiting until recently. Zhao Cheng Ying recently hired lawyer Shen Yiqian to file a complaint with the criminal division of the First Special Court, accusing Zhao Liyuan of using fraudulent means to entice her into illicit relations, causing bodily harm, and restricting her freedom, and filed an ancillary civil suit. The complaint stated that the plaintiff had received higher education and worked in a hospital. The defendant, in September of the previous year, used

Sweet Words of Enticement

And falsely claimed to be unmarried, wanting to marry the plaintiff. The plaintiff believed this to be true, and due to the severity of the national crisis, the marriage ceremony was temporarily postponed. The defendant then personally wrote a note on September 25 of that year, which was given to the plaintiff as evidence, and then forced her into illicit relations. Initially, they rented a house to cohabit at 8 Putuo Road, and then moved into the defendant's factory. Due to the heavy workload of the factory, the plaintiff was ordered to manage the factory's accounts without pay, and the defendant only wrote two gift agreements, one for a British Austin engine No. 183701

A Vehicle

And one for 50% of the income from the completion of the Ziliujing project in Xichengli, as remuneration. Later, due to a shortage of working capital in the defendant's factory, the plaintiff was tricked into giving him 1,000 yuan of her cash. Afterwards, she discovered that the defendant already had a wife and negotiated with him, questioning why he lied and deceived her, enticing a woman into illicit relations. Unexpectedly, the defendant became angry and, at 6:00 PM on December 11 of last year, beat her in the factory, causing injuries to her head, face, hands, and legs, and

Imprisoned Her in a Room

Neither allowing her to seek medical treatment nor allowing her freedom of movement. In order to protect her life, the plaintiff had no choice but to escape on December 13 at 5:00 PM, go to the hospital for treatment, and have her injuries examined by the court. She also hired a lawyer to send a letter of protest and is now suing under Article 229 of the Criminal Law for offenses against public morals, Article 302 for restricting freedom, and Article 277 for assault. In addition to requesting punishment in accordance with the law, she is also filing an ancillary civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay the plaintiff a loan of 1,000 yuan, compensation for professional losses of 960 yuan,

Emotional Damages

1,000 yuan, and to return the items gifted by the defendant. The court approved the motion and ordered a summons. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Both the plaintiff and defendant appeared in court in person. However, before the trial began, both parties were seated together on the back benches of the audience, talking intimately for a long time. When the case was opened, the plaintiff, Zhao Cheng Ying, stated the above situation and requested a strict investigation. As for the ancillary civil suit, her representative lawyer, Shen Yiqian,

Indicated Withdrawal

When questioning the defendant, lawyer Shen Ronghua also presented a defense, stating that the defendant saw the advertisement for a spouse in the newspaper on September 6, 1937, and therefore cohabited with the plaintiff. During the period of cohabitation, he was tricked into writing a note, and he now regrets this foolish and confused act. Now, the plaintiff is using this as evidence to sue under Article 39 of the Criminal Law, which is

A Woman Mistakenly Believing

Him to be her spouse and obeying his illicit acts as the requirement. Now, the defendant responded to the plaintiff's solicitation and cohabited with her. Therefore, the use of fraudulent means came from the plaintiff, not the defendant. Thus, the defendant is indeed a deceived person. The note was written by the plaintiff after cohabitation, using fraudulent means to make the defendant write it. How can it constitute a crime under that article? Furthermore, at 6:00 PM on February 11 of last year, the defendant did not beat the plaintiff or imprison her. This matter

Arises From Dissatisfaction After the Defendant Moved His Wife Into the Factory

And swept away all her belongings

And 1,000 yuan in cash, as well as seven pieces of his wife's clothing. The defendant reported this to the Gordon Road Police Station on the 13th, and there is a record of this. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff created injuries on December 14 and had them examined by the honorable court, hoping to frame the defendant. Furthermore, the plaintiff's advertisement stated that the applicant should be able to provide economic support, indicating that she had no

Economic Ability

The statement in the complaint that she was tricked out of 1,000 yuan by the defendant is entirely false. In summary, the plaintiff's current lawsuit is actually a pre-emptive strike and should be dismissed in its entirety. Finally, the plaintiff stated that the beating was witnessed by the maid, Zhang Ma. Zhang Ma has now been dismissed by the defendant, but can be found. She requested a summons. The court then decided to reschedule the trial in seven days.

### Impersonating a Fortune Teller to Defraud Wealth - Preposterous and Ridiculous Claims - Said That the God of Wealth Had Already Started From Guiyang - Stopped Midway by Hundreds of Thousands of Ghosts - Mrs. Xue Was Tricked Out of Property and Money Extracted Successively

Hua Dawei, a native of Wuxi, did not engage in proper work and repeatedly changed his name, such as Hua Kuihui and Hua Renzhong, all of which were his aliases. When the war broke out, he was unemployed and bored, so he came up with a wild idea to impersonate a prophet, changed his name to Lin Yimusen, set up a place at No. 18, Lane 641 (i.e., Butterfly Village), Yuyuan Road, and used the Jianhua Radio Station to broadcast, luring the public. This led to a young woman named Xue, who lived nearby, being deceived, losing 4,000 yuan in legal tender and over 2,000 in gold pounds and gold jewelry.

Recently Exposed

The detectives of the Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested the scammer and sent him to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention, which has been detailed in previous reports. It is now known that the criminal used the art of false fortune-telling to defraud wealth from the superstitious for more than a year. It seems that the Xue woman was not the only one who lost money. The gold jewelry and gold pounds lost by the Xue family have been partially recovered by Detective Wu Chengmo and Detective Liang Yuliang, who were in charge of the case, from the Shuntai and Hechang pawnshops in the British and French Concessions. They also submitted

The Defrauded Deposits

In addition, the criminal's residence at No. 33, Lane 155, Xuehuali Road, also yielded property obtained through fraud. The Xue family has confirmed that these items do not belong to them, so there must be other owners. Therefore, the police authorities hope that deceived men and women will come forward to the Jing'an Temple Police Station in time to report the crime for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai interrogated him again. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, gave a detailed account of the police's investigation, stating that when the defendant was arrested, eight pawn tickets were found on him. One of them had already been redeemed from the Hechang pawnshop,

The Pawned Gold Ring

Three rings, but only one belonged to Mrs. Xue. The other two were obtained by defrauding others. The Shuntai Pawnshop in Fujian Road had sent five British gold pounds and one US dollar pawned by the defendant to the police station, which had also been identified as belonging to Mrs. Xue. The pawn ticket found at the defendant's residence on Xuehuali Road was for 15 gold pounds and a gold bracelet, all belonging to Mrs. Xue. In addition, 199 yuan out of the 200 yuan deposit recovered from the Commercial Bank, 63 yuan in legal tender found on the defendant, and 135 yuan in legal tender found on the body of Jin Xiuqin, a woman from the American Lingxiang Guide Agency who was staying with the defendant at the

Central Hotel

Were all admitted by the defendant to be part of the large sum defrauded from Mrs. Xue. Also, the defendant's lawyer sent 200 yuan in legal tender to the police station yesterday, stating that this was the amount returned by the defendant and should be returned to the original owner, along with the current soft, together with the 32 yuan earned by the defendant by falsely claiming to have refined gold twice and selling it to Biaotianbao Silver Building. The gold pounds and gold jewelry must be

Obtained by the Original Owner by Preparing Funds

As for the furniture in the fortune-telling house on Yuyuan Road, since they were decorations for deception, they should be sold and the proceeds used to compensate Mrs. Xue. Subsequently, Xue Min detailed the process of being defrauded. All the tricks made by the criminal were so laughable that they made people laugh. The woman seemed to have woken up a little, so she asked for the damaged property every day. The criminal always made excuses to prevaricate, even lying and saying that the God of Wealth had already started from

Guiyang

That four or five million in wealth could be obtained easily, but he had not arrived because he was stopped by hundreds of thousands of ghosts who died in battle on the way. Laughter erupted when the woman mentioned this in court. The court then questioned the defendant, who admitted to the deception without denial. As for the missing gold jewelry, he claimed that it was stolen and escaped by his hired assistant. Judge Dai decided to remand him in custody and reschedule the trial.

### Recent Developments of the Chinese Athletic Association: Reviewing and Approving Specialized Athletic Terms, Preparing Proposals for the National Education Conference

(Chongqing Correspondence) The Chinese Athletic Association has been established for two years, and its recent work has been quite intensive. The main points are recorded below:

"Reviewing and Approving Specialized Athletic Terms": The review of athletic terms is crucial. The Association has now reached an agreement with the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to find suitable personnel to assist in the Bureau to complete this work. It is expected to start within three months and complete the review within one year.

"Studying Women's Sports": Due to physiological reasons, the types of sports for women are obviously different from those for men. It is necessary to study this issue as soon as possible. The Association has now hired Gao Zi, Zhou Shang, Sun Shuqian, Sun Jialin, Chen Meiyu, etc. to form a committee to engage in research.

"Experimenting with Athletic Tests and Grading Methods": The Association recently discussed test items and methods and specially invited Nankai School to assist in conducting field experiments. Wu Yunrui, Zhou Shang, Huang Zhongfu, Gao Yan, Cheng Dengke, etc. were invited to form a committee to study them in order to determine test standards and grading methods for students' athletic performance. In the future, the results of the experiment will be submitted to the Ministry of Education for adoption.

"Preparing Proposals for the Third National Education Conference": The Association is preparing proposals for the upcoming Third National Education Conference for discussion.

"Publication of Athletic Research Papers": The Association originally planned to publish the "Athletics Bi-Monthly," but it was discontinued due to the high cost. Recently, the Association joined the Joint Office of Educational and Academic Groups, and it was decided to send research papers from the Association's members to the "National Construction Education Quarterly" published by the office for publication.

School Overview

### Zhonghua Elementary and Middle School

The first branch of Qipu Road Zhonghua Elementary and Middle School and the second branch of the school on Avenue Edward VII were reorganized from the former Taihu Elementary and Middle School. They were both filed with the Ministry of Education and registered with the Bureau of Education. After the outbreak of the "August 13th" Incident, the school's Qipu Road location was close to the war zone, so it moved south to Junle Village, Avenue Edward VII and Rue Massenet for classes. As the war shifted westward, the original Qipu Road location was restored, and the new location on Avenue Edward VII could not be merged due to the large number of students. Thus, it was divided into two branches, one and two.

Currently, the two branches have more than 800 students, 44 faculty and staff, and 24 classrooms. Principal Yang Yuecai is a hardworking and enduring person who can implement the new life. Pan Bingchang, Director of Teaching Affairs of the first branch. Xu Zhongming, Director of General Affairs. Du Bingzhong, Director of Teaching Affairs of the second branch. Zhang Gongyun, Director of General Affairs. All are university graduates and have served in the education field for many years, with extremely rich knowledge and experience. Among the 44 faculty and staff members, 14 are graduates of universities, 3 are graduates of higher normal schools, 7 are graduates of vocational schools, 8 are graduates of senior high normal schools, 7 are graduates of county normal schools, and 5 are graduates of senior high schools, truly a selection of talents. The organization is divided into three grades and six classes in the junior high school department, six grades and twelve classes in the elementary school department, and two classes in the kindergarten. Each department admits both boys and girls, and provides board and lodging. Management is strict, and teaching is serious. Great attention is paid to extracurricular activities and holiday assignments, which are personally guided by the homeroom teachers of each grade, so students' interests are quite strong, and the results are considered excellent. In addition to the six regular classes each day, the school has one morning class and two evening classes before 9:00 AM and after 7:00 PM, respectively, which are attended and supervised by teachers in rotation, which is quite serious. If there is an absence, the academic affairs office will notify the students' parents to inquire about the reason, and if it is considered truancy, points will be deducted or demerits will be recorded.

It is heard that the school authorities are not satisfied with the current situation and have already planned a development plan for the next semester. In addition to actively reorganizing the original two branches, they are currently negotiating for school cooperation in the western district and will add a third branch to expand greatly.

### Yiyuan Was Sold Out Yesterday, Tung Wah Defeats the French Military Union, Friendly Match Result: Five to Three, Tung Wah Won Two Goals in the First Half

The friendly soccer match between Tung Wah and the French Military Union took place at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM yesterday.

Yesterday's Tung Wah team was a mixed team of Division A and B players, while the French Military Union gathered the elite of the French army, no less than Tung Wah. Although they were behind by two goals in the first half with a score of 0 to 2, they chased the score to 3 to 3 in the second half, but Tung Wah finally relied on Lin Jinghui Zhang, twice directly attacking the opponent's goal, and laid the foundation for the overall situation, winning the final victory with five to three.

After the two sides took their positions, Tung Wah launched the first attack. Dai Linjing immediately got a free kick at the 20-yard mark and shot, but it bounced off Jek's body. Dai shot again but was blocked. After a good opportunity was lost, the momentum gradually became balanced. After a long stalemate, at 20 minutes, the five forwards of Tung Wah advanced together. Dai Linjing passed to Sun Huizhang, who made a long shot from 25 yards and succeeded in one fell swoop. The record was opened. After Tung Wah got this goal, their momentum greatly increased. At 33 minutes, Jia Youliang crossed the ball, and Dai Linjing feinted, letting the ball pass. Shen Shiyan scored again and broke the door again. At the end of the first half, Tung Wah led by two to zero. Changing sides to fight again, Tung Wah's momentum was still burning. Just over nine minutes, Dai Linjing shot fiercely, and the goalkeeper Pushed it out. Dai jumped up and shot again, hitting the mark, three to zero, leading impressively. Seeing that the situation was not good, the French Military Union launched a desperate counterattack. Grant exerted all his skills, dribbled past Zhao Aisheng, and shot into the net, pulling back a goal. Only two minutes separated this goal from the previous one. The French Military Union also looked brilliant thereafter. At 20 minutes, Ereira scored at the 15-yard mark, making it three to two. Less than five minutes later, Grant used the same trick again, dribbling past two defenders, making it two to two equality. In this situation, Tung Wah tried hard to develop. As expected, Dai Linjing made a contribution, once again in a superior position. Seven minutes before the end, Sun Huizhang scored another goal, which Tung Wah relied on to secure the victory, triumphing by five to three.

### "Humph"

— Douqin

Saying "yes" makes one think of the opposite of "yes," which is: "Humph."

"Yes" is the art of subordinates speaking to superiors, while "Humph" is the art of superiors speaking to subordinates.

Still in the Qing Dynasty, the ancient ancestor of the current "Manchukuo," this art was most fully developed. When subordinates spoke to superiors, the superiors always replied with a "Humph." When you reported something to him, he "Humph'd"; when you submitted a memorial, he "Humph'd"; when you complimented him, he "Humph'd"; even when you asked for his opinion, he would respond with a "Humph." The function of this art was to express the authority of the superior and the unpredictability of the superior. And the most important thing was that he had an idea but didn't say it, wanting you to guess his meaning and do it. If you wanted to bribe him, it would show that he wasn't necessarily going to do that, but that you yourself sought him out.

This "Humph" and "Yes" created the Qing Dynasty's world. We can say: superiors "Humph," subordinates "Yes," that is politics!

Did this art disappear after the Republic of China? In my opinion, it has not. For example, more than ten years ago, when the people made suggestions to the government, the government did not speak, which was actually equivalent to "Humph," meaning: "Do you also have the right to manage our affairs?" When students petitioned the government, the government also did not speak, which was actually equivalent to "Humph," meaning: "Do you dare to ask about our affairs?" Only this time, the result of the "Humph" was that the military police opened fire. After the petitioners were killed, the government did not speak, but it was actually still equivalent to "Humph," the meaning of which was: "What a trivial matter!" In short, they were still using the art of "Humph" to handle everything.

Later, whether people's mouths were still "Humph'ing," I do not know, but the art of "Humph" became more exquisite and more common, which is a fact.

As for not stating the meaning and wanting you to guess and do it, that tradition has not changed. We only need to look at how in the past, whenever there was a major event, someone would just make a light sound, or even no sound at all, and many people would start fussing about it, which is evidence. Of course, if the fussing was not done well, the person would be angry, but still without showing any emotion, just a "Humph." However, with this "Humph," those fussing people didn't even have time to "Yes" once before being kicked away. But this was only temporary, and those people would still have the opportunity to hear a new "Humph" next time.

These are all about internal affairs. When it comes to foreign affairs, it's the opposite: those who used to "Humph" at people have become afraid to "Humph."

I don't know if China infected foreign countries, or if foreign countries were originally like this? Foreign masters also understand how to use the art of "Humph" towards China. Of course, it's a foreign product, and somewhat different from domestic products, but the essence of the "Humph" is still the same. And the foreign "Humph" and the domestic "Yes" also match very well, and that "order form" is often almost exactly the same as what we have always used ourselves.

These are all about the past. When it comes to the present—unfortunately, we can still cite examples.

I cannot help but drag in Mr. Wang Jingwei again. When Konoe "Humph'd," Mr. Wang quickly "Yes'd," and even "Yes'd" out the words that were not "Humph'd" out in that "Humph." But the reality is also very cruel, and then the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" issued a statement saying: "If Mr. Wang thinks that Konoe's statement was issued because Japan encountered military difficulties in China, then that is a mistaken view." This means: you didn't fuss about it well! With this "Humph," Mr. Wang is in great danger of being kicked away. Of course, if Mr. Wang is willing to live a "Yes" life, he will still have the opportunity to hear a new "Humph."

The opposite of "Yes" should be "No." A "Humph" will turn into "Oh" when it encounters a "No." This "Oh" means: You are the ones who cannot be bullied! Following this sound is the opening of the mouth. What we want to see are those mouths that are opened and never close again.

### The Ups and Downs of Hell

— Junbo

— Postscript to Suzhou

Walk slowly! Watch your cough! To go to hell, you must be careful. Don't mind the owl's eyes; the bat's wings, just keep walking forward. Even if there are small shadows shaking at the foot of the wall, and the hands of wild ghosts shine with blades and halberds; do not reveal any panic.

Originally, you didn't have to take a bath early to wash away the dirt on your body, isn't hell the very place of purity? Quick! Don't stand still! Stop! Make a circle and let a drizzle sprinkle on your clothes. Don't underestimate this small mist, relying on it, you are guaranteed a few years of peaceful happiness. Don't tell your friends that you have suffered a great injustice, you must bless that this is the glory of "baptism." (Note: You must be disinfected with medicinal water upon entering the city.)

Search! Relax! There is no real treasure in my pocket; nor is a bomb tied to my waist. Feel free to touch every part of my body with your hands, you will not find the burning flame in my heart.

Without your incantation, open the gates of hell, the two leaves of the gates can rest on either side. Hey! Partners! Don't panic! Go! Lean close to our shoulders!

Thanks to a gust of yin wind blowing, bringing a fragrant smell. Secretly tell your heart, stop the beating, don't be blurred by opium.

Who told you not to pay attention to your feet, look! A small stone broke the tip of your shoe. I told you early on, hell is a magic cave, be careful, a poisonous snake will swallow your eyes, and a wild bee will pierce your chest.

Hey! Faithful partners! Why the sad faces? Facing your small garden, covering your eyes with your sleeves. Could it be that you can't find your hand-planted green pine? Mourning the fall of the flowering crabapple? The dust on the stone steps has buried the footprints of your past wanderings; the rattan chair in the dilapidated building has long lost your former laughter. You can't see the light waves rolling on the small stream, like a silent dead water, quietly passing its years. Creepers hang with a bleakness, a few small insects hide half of their bodies, sighing at the desolation of the garden under the tears of the old master. The grape trellis has collapsed beyond recognition, like the wailing of a prostrate old woman, scattering her disheveled hair in the wind. On the thin and bald peach branches, there is no nightingale singing happily, only the cawing of crows is filling the space. The puppy raises its tail, staring with both eyes, it has tasted the flesh and bones of the new master, and has long abandoned your kindness. You still want to hold its face, give it a kiss, and call it a good boy. Hmph! Don't think about it anymore, next year, prepare a stick and give it a good beating.

Stop sighing, this small garden no longer has the blessings for you to leisurely enjoy. Quick! Don't stay! Go! Go to the long street to see the hustle and bustle. There are the clamors of little ghosts, inside the vermilion gates, go and take a look, I'm not lying, the play of ghosts is being performed inside. Don't be surprised by the red robes and black gauze flying everywhere, don't you see a black thread pulling above?

What? Climbing the mountain of knives! It doesn't matter! Go hang a piece of flesh from your old friend's corpse; entering the pool of blood! It doesn't matter! Go and distinguish the stench of your friend's blood rising under a pile of floating algae? Don't you see the copper ring on that door shining with the light of his face. Be quiet for a moment, listen to his words, shake your heart.

"Don't wander around, help me, to eat the eastern sun."

Relax! Friends! I won't let you down! Look! Lean close to our shoulders!

Hey! Partners! Dare? Just use tired eyes to look at the female ghost. Hurry up and lead me away, before the cooking smoke blinds your eyes; the two lazy wild ghosts are dozing off in front of the door. Go! Hurry up!

It is your footsteps that have awakened them again, look, they are putting on fierce postures again, stretching out their knives and guns towards us.

Search! We have to search again! Anyway, I am not afraid of annoyance, you don't have to be stubborn, let their hands touch our bodies again to their heart's content!

Go! Hey! Blockheads! Wild ghosts! This time you have fallen for my trick again, who told you not to search for the memories in our brains. Make up your mind, remember the words of your friends, eat the eastern sun.

### These are all "Military Supplies."

— Cangqi

### Ashamed

— Miao He

Wandering, wandering, wandering. A shoulder of luggage, a free car. From Shanghai to Nanjing, Nanjing to Hankou, through countless hardships, now I have arrived in Changsha.

Not a single relative in sight; but every compatriot's face, every compatriot's eyes, are so kind and warm.

The destroyed home, the brother who died in the disaster, the heart of a wanderer who has lost his homeland, is warmed in the embrace of the motherland.

I laugh, facing the great national flag under the sun; I cry, dreaming of my hometown and brothers.

But crying is cowardly; smiling cannot fulfill my wishes. Put everything aside, grasp reality, move forward bravely, under the banner of resistance to the end, pursue the arrival of the final victory.

When the Anti-Enemy Support Association could not accommodate me, my heart was broken, like an injured sheep. But "it is better for a lion to live heroically for a day than for a sheep to survive for a hundred years." I have to roar, roar like a lion; otherwise, I will be sacrificed.

Stepping into a small inn, a room that costs nine jiao a day, temporarily became my home.

Running every day, until my legs are sore and I am exhausted, but hope is still slim.

Spring follows winter, and the Creator does not disappoint those with good intentions. Finally, I found the recruitment for the aviation mechanics class in the newspaper.

I jump, from toes to fingers; I laugh, from mouth to heart. I also think that soon there will be planes touched by me, exploding the enemy's chest in mid-air, splitting their brains, in the destroyed hometown, where my brothers suffered.

But the recruitment date in the newspaper reminded me of my pocket. One month, one month, one month, that's thirty days; where will I get the fifteen yuan? I have to go back to Hankou; in the shelter in Hankou, I can wait for a month, wait for thirty days, without spending money.

Before leaving, I said goodbye to a few new acquaintances. When they asked me the reason and the location, I could only tell them everything.

"I can find a way for this money, please rest assured, Zhenzhi." The young Guo Dong kept me, comforted me. He also asked the boss how much it would cost to live here for a month.

When the boss only asked for nine yuan, I was simply moved to tears. Ah, under the banner of the war of resistance, we are especially kind.

"Isn't nine yuan easy to get? I'll give you five yuan, who else will give him some." Under Guo Dong's call, I got two yuan, I got one yuan, I got two yuan, helping me, this wanderer.

Ah, when I discovered that a prostitute who made a living by selling her body also took out two yuan, revealing a happy smile, to help me, I couldn't say anything, I could only accept their kindness with shame.

I will work hard for the country, struggle, to thank the kindness of several people, and avenge the compatriots who sacrificed for the country.

I was admitted, I was admitted. I am happy, I am laughing; I can work hard for the country, I have grasped my wish.

Because of work, I sold a free car that had gone through thick and thin with me, and gave the money to the people who helped me. When they refused to accept it, I said:

"Everyone, please accept it, I thank you for your kindness. Please keep this money and give it to the second me, because there are really many unfortunate people like me now. I don't need money anymore. Goodbye, goodbye, work hard later, and use that as my answer.)"

### Announcement

We have received a letter from Mr. Mu Jin, stating that the "Ode to Scorched Earth" published on January 4 was published in the "Honeybee Bi-Monthly" a month ago, with the same signature. Two submissions for one manuscript, the compensation is canceled according to the rules. Thank you very much, Mr. Mu Jin. Editorial Office

### My Roar

— Feng Bai

Ah, hometown, hometown has fallen under the iron hooves of the invaders!

There, a group of vicious jackals are rampant now:

They burned my village, trampled on my land;

They raped my sisters, and killed my parents.

Millions of people are complaining about the calamity of being slaves;

Millions of lives are being wasted like pigs and dogs.

That is a purgatory filled with the breath of death.

That is a slaughterhouse overflowing with the stench of blood!

I am a young man, I cannot be as cowardly as a lamb,

Allowing wild beasts to seize my life and gnaw at my chest.

My will is strengthened from persecution,

My anger has inspired my strength to kill the enemy.

I do not forget the instructions of the village elders: every man should take responsibility for the rise and fall of the country.

I do not forget that China has had five thousand years of civilization and glory!

I firmly believe in the dialectics of history: hardship can revitalize the country.

Sacred bloodshed; grasp the hope of the final victory!

Without taking away a trace of nostalgia, without taking away a thread of sadness,

In a terrifying night, I escaped from my hometown.

I forget the cold and hunger, forget the endless suffering;

I yearn for: the unparalleled tragedy of the distant journey.

I yearn: to gallop proudly in the Central Plains like a knight:

Risking my flesh and blood, I will fight to the death with the jackals!

I think one day, I will use the enemy's head as a wine cup,

Drinking heartily on the top of the majestic Changbai Mountain, along the long Yalu River!

When will I complete my mission and take off my military uniform?

When will I sing triumphantly and return to my hometown?

When the heroic attack extinguishes the enemy's arrogance,

When the blood and tears of the ×× nation, converge into a revolutionary wave,

When justice drives away the mad storm of fascism,

When the Chinese nation wins complete liberation in the war of resistance,

When the five million square miles of lost land, wipe away the shame,

When the flag of the motherland, flies proudly in my hometown!

### Grains Wheat Bran Drops Two Jiao in the Dark Market, Raw Peanuts Shipped to Hong Kong and Shantou

Although the market situation of wheat bran is still holding up on the surface, small households are secretly spitting it out, but most of them are for the sake of settlement procedures, so in the urgent situation, it is appropriate for buyers to kill it fiercely. Yesterday, it was heard that the price of large bags of wheat bran from Fufeng Factory was three yuan, one jiao, and six fen, which was about two jiao lower than the peak price of the previous week. The export of miscellaneous grains included 2,390 bags of raw peanuts, which were transferred from Yantai to Hong Kong, and 350 bags, which were transported to Shantou, and 700 bags of beans were also transported to Shantou,

### Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand are Equally Matched

Yesterday's exchange market turned down the exchange rate between England and the United States, so the situation returned to English looseness and American flatness, although foreign firms still came to settle in the middle, but Xiao Luson and Sassoon in Hong Kong repeatedly suppressed them, and Western merchants and Chinese banks also had a strong intention to sell, resulting in the equal matching of supply and demand, there was no special change in the process, the transaction sharply decreased, and people's hearts became more stable,

In the early morning, the London big bars were near shrinkage and far flatness, the New York silver price did not move, the London raw gold was two pence again, the exchange rate between England and the United States shrank by three li, one small three sheng ding against France, one two five against Shanghai, the United States fell by two five against England, shrunk two five against France, and did not move against Shanghai.

After opening, Hong Kong Electricity and Sassoon jointly supplied the Youli Bank with a spot sterling of eight li and three two eight one two five, and Xiao Luson also telegraphed and sold to the Datong Bank a spot US dollar of sixteen yuan two five, so the potential trend was hardening, and HSBC's listing was announced without moving, the silver equilibrium tax was also small two five, after which the foreign firms had frequent settlement, and absorbed the Datong American Bank's spot US dollar of sixteen yuan two one eight seven five, and also purchased HSBC's spot sterling of eight li and three one two five, so the situation became tight again, near the noon closing, the money exchange industry sold Hong Kong's five yuan five yuan to Andalawa, so the situation returned to flatness, the noon closing price was eight li and three two eight one two five against the English gold and sixteen yuan two one eight seven five against the US dollar

After the coin, the Chinese Bank frequently supplied Magali Youli with spot sterling of eight li and three one two five, and also sold to the American Datong Bank spot US dollars of sixteen yuan two five, although it was heard that the foreign firms came to settle the spot sterling of eight li and three one two five, but because Magali HSBC Youli and others had the intention to supply, and the money exchange industry sold 55.75 yuan of Hong Kong dollars to the Netherlands, the situation changed very little, and it was extended to the late closing bank's selling price of eight li and three two eight one two five for the English exchange and sixteen yuan one two eight seven five for the US exchange. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the English currency was long by .015625, the US currency had no rise or fall, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was also flat, still at 55.75 yuan,

### Oil Cakes The Supply of Raw Materials is Insufficient; Soybean Cake Sales are Rising Daily

The strong upward trend of soybean cake prices is still fierce. In short, the supply of raw materials is still insufficient, and the factory itself has not been sound, so in the enthusiastic willingness to deal, the market atmosphere is becoming more and more high. The four-brand cakes of the Da You Yu Factory yesterday and the day before yesterday had been raised from three yuan one jiao four fen to three yuan one jiao five fen. The market rose again yesterday, opening at three yuan one jiao seven fen. It was heard that it was successively acquired by the Xiamen gang. The export of oil included 390 pieces of raw oil and 8,350 tins, which were transferred from Yantai to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market Zhang Diao Qing Xian Xin, Two Hundred and Several Packages Arrived

The sugar market was stable yesterday, with the guild's pricing at 24 yuan and eight jiao for the No. 24 Dutch coarse white original warehouse goods, 16 yuan and five jiao for the transshipment goods, and 23 yuan and nine jiao and a half for the Taikoo military white B mark West warehouse goods, which continued to be allocated. The new Qing Diao of Guotang had already been imported by the Taikoo Company's Jiaying Wheel yesterday, and two hundred and several packages arrived. The samples have not yet been seen. If it belongs to the Shangzhuang, it will definitely be sold well when the new Qing is out of stock. In addition, 313 pieces of Cantonese sugar continued to arrive, as well as 100 bags and 200 boxes of Taikoo sugar.

Today, 2,000 bags are being transported to Ningbo.

### Securities The Debt Market Has Not Yet Shown Vigor; The London Railway Bonds Still Have Inquiries

The dark market for securities was unstable in yesterday's market, and has not yet returned to tranquility. The government has a clearer regulation on the temporary measures that had to be taken, that is, the interest of this session is still paid in legal currency in Shanghai, but it must be paid in installments of six months on average. The income tax payable will be deducted in full at the time of the first payment. In this way, it has been clearly stated that there is no problem with the repayment of principal and interest. However, from the perspective of the merchants, the postponement has been extended for three months in an invisible manner. The war has been extended for a year and a half, and the government's maintenance of domestic public bonds has remained unchanged. This slightly reformed decision has its own painful intentions, which should be forgiven, but the general profiteers still feel uneasy, so until yesterday, the market price still fluctuated greatly. Initially, it turned quite good, but then it was powerless and declined. Because although retail investors have a slight absorption capacity, they are ultimately no match for the strong selling of the Beibang Gongmao Company, so the market price is high and then low again. The trend is that it is not easy to look up because there are always sellers putting high pressure. In the afternoon, the transaction was very rare. Only Maoda and No. 11 had a little more thought, but there was a lack of enthusiastic purchases from large households. Although the market price rebounded slightly, it still did not show any excitement. As a result of the market price, the unanimous rebound was slightly, mostly from one jiao and a half to three jiao, except for the Type A, which rose by eight jiao, because its previous fall was also the greatest. The total number of transactions was approximately 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to the Previous Day

Unified A 57.40 56.70 5.20 Rose 0.80

### Miscellaneous: The Jute Bag Market Remains Stable

The primary source of jute bags is Guangzhou and Hong Kong, followed by Shantou, and the least from Xiamen. In the past, a large quantity was shipped to Shanghai for sale. Since the outbreak of military conflicts, both Shantou and Xiamen have been affected, with local military and political authorities ordering a ban on exports. Last autumn, only a few dozen pieces of Xiamen goods arrived under special circumstances. The quoted prices were as follows: Double Heaven Chong, new green edge, 660 yuan per thousand; Genuine Rangoon, 565 yuan; Chong Rangoon, 520 yuan; Chong New Single Mark blue edge, 480 yuan; Bean green edge, 560 yuan; First piece of Fat Tian flour bags, 470 yuan; Washed Fat flour bags, 430 yuan; Miscellaneous bags, 280 yuan; Chong Single Mark green edge, 600 yuan. Although the arrival of goods has been scarce recently, sales have also been sluggish. Even with a drop of 20 to 30 yuan, there are few takers. However, this year, rice from various regions being shipped to Shanghai, which was previously transported in bulk by boat, is now mostly packaged and transported by steamer and train, significantly increasing demand. It is inevitable that prices will be temporarily raised due to the relationship between supply and demand. Nevertheless, the overall market remains calm.

### Seafood: Black Pepper Market Tightening

Due to the low inventory of pepper here and the continuous purchasing by various merchant guilds, the market is gradually tightening. Recently, the asking price has risen by two yuan. For example, Grade 1 pepper is 59 yuan, and Black Big Pepper is 56 yuan. As the source is also scarce, it seems likely to continue to rise. White pepper is 90 yuan and remains stable.

### Yarn and Cotton: Raw Cotton Remains Firm, Yarn Industry's Optimism Deepens, Japanese Yarn Also Rises by One Yuan

The yarn market continues to advance, with the price increase being gradual. Although there has been no large-scale wholesale development recently, purchasing by the Yunnan guild continues unabated. At the same time, raw materials remain firm and sourcing from various routes is difficult. As a result, hoarders have strong intentions and are keen on stockpiling. Therefore, inter-trade transactions in the market are increasing daily. It is also said that the sales of cotton cloth in the eastern Zhejiang area have become more active recently, and there is also demand for cotton yarn. Unfortunately, funds cannot be fully allocated for the time being, and they are waiting for the silver from the export of local products to be adjusted before purchasing cotton yarn. As a result, most people are bullish on price increases, and market prices are gradually rising. At the opening of the yarn market yesterday morning, 240 bales were sold by the Yunnan guild from the previous day, with many purchases from fellow traders. Prices have risen and confidence has increased. The asking price for 20-count Double Horse yarn increased by three yuan to 397 yuan, which was a transaction of ten bales among fellow traders. Soon, those who profited sold out, and the price fell back by one and a half yuan. Afterwards, it hovered around, with the lowest price being 394 yuan. Actual sales were still piecemeal, but some traders remained optimistic and continued to absorb warehouse receipts. By the close of the market, the price had returned to 396 yuan. As a result, the total transaction volume in the morning was 747 bales, compared to 480 bales in the afternoon of the previous day, for a total of 1,227 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by two yuan, Special Jincheng rose by two yuan, Tiannu rose by two yuan, Double Globe rose by four yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by one yuan. Chongxin Factory offered 140 bales of 10-count Dafa yarn at a price of 295 yuan. Today, 220 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Ningbo, and another 160 pieces were exported to Shantou. The amount purchased by each guild is listed below:

Fellow traders 650, Shantou 0, Yunnan 300

Jiangxi 20, Northern guild 80, Inland 20

Hong Kong 20, Ningbo and Luoyang, Total 1,227 bales

The trend of Japanese yarn continues to rise, but the increase is gradual. Business is active in Tianjin, but there is no demand elsewhere. The current asking price for 20-count Mizuyoshi yarn is 316 yuan, 315 yuan to 314.5 yuan for this month, and 312 yuan for 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn, 312.5 yuan to 310.5 yuan for this month, an average increase of about one yuan compared to the previous day.

### Foreign Cotton: Loaned American Cotton May Be Sold Off, Pending the International Conference; Shenxin Purchases 200 Bales of American Cotton En Route

Regarding the market price of foreign cotton, according to cotton industry personnel of the government, Secretary Henry Wells of the Ministry of Agriculture plans to invite cotton producing countries around the world to participate in an international cotton conference. This action is an implication to the cotton producing nations, that if they cannot assist with solving the issue of surplus American cotton, then the American government will take the extreme measure of dumping government-owned loaned cotton overseas, causing the cotton prices of all nations to plummet. It is commonly believed that cotton producing nations can find an appropriate method to solve the issue jointly, thus protecting their interests in cotton prices. Yesterday, the spot market in New York was very active, with factories showing strong interest in raw cotton purchases due to the increasing sales of cloth. However, all industries in the market fear the sale of loaned cotton, which would cause prices to fall sharply, and people are extremely panicked. Many people closed out their positions with profits, so New York only rose by three to four points, India rose by 25 rupees, and Egypt rose by seven to eight points. Yesterday, the exchange rate still could not be extended, and the legal tender price of cotton all rose, with American and Brazilian cotton rising by six jiao per dan, Indian cotton rising by three jiao, and Egyptian cotton rising by more than eight jiao.

The source of local cotton is becoming more difficult, but due to the inability to extend the exchange rate, foreign cotton transactions are becoming increasingly sluggish. Aside from Shenxin purchasing 200 bales of American cotton en route yesterday, most Chinese factories are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Japanese merchants are still the main buyers these days. The transaction volume and prices are recorded below:

(1) Transaction Volume Yesterday

### Fire Machine Cotton Reaches New High Price, Remittance Price Opens at 70 Yuan

The local cotton business continues to thrive, with white-packed cotton being dominant. New peaks are emerging one after another, and the remittance price for Fire Machine Cotton has reached 70 yuan. Fine-staple cotton was traded slightly yesterday, like a flash in the pan, and then disappeared again yesterday. Demand from Japanese factories is sluggish, and no deals have been made. Although there is no wholesale consumption from Chinese factories, retail transactions continue unabated. Shenxin Factory purchased another 2,000 bales of Fire Machine Cotton at a price of 70 yuan, an increase of 1.75 yuan compared to the past. Other cotton prices are slightly rising, generally similar to the previous day. Yongan Factory purchased 500 pieces of American Upland packed cotton at a price of 78 yuan, which can spin raw materials of 23 counts or more. Other traders still have healthy appetites. The source from the Subei area is still accessible. 2,567 bales of Tongzhou coarse and fine-staple cotton arrived, and another 990 pieces arrived from Beisha.

### Grains: Second Batch of American Wheat Arriving Soon, Domestic Wheat Falls More Sharply Than Before, Flour Market Shows Signs of Collapse

Flour:

Regarding the current flour market, factory prices have fallen back by five cents. As for customer sales, since the arrival of the first batch of factory-designated foreign wheat in Shanghai, it is believed that market prices should be viewed as declining, but the factories have been unwilling to make concessions for some time, so they have been holding on for many days. Yesterday, customer sales in the market were quite quiet. Northern merchants from Tianjin and other places had even weaker appetites due to unsuitable container water, so the flour market, which has been at high prices for a long time, has shown signs of collapse and is declining. The total wholesale volume of various brands of Grade 2 flour in this street is about 7,000 bags. Sales to Northern and Southern merchants are also limited to 7,000 to 8,000 bags. Transactions are mostly with merchants from Southern areas such as Fujian. There are also 2,000 bags of Red God of Wealth flour, with the price opening at 4.35 yuan, which is also five cents lower than the previous price. Today, 5,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin.

Wheat: Yesterday, the decline in wheat prices was more severe. It was found that no less than 4,000 bags arrived by train. Due to the sluggish sales of flour in recent days and the successive arrival of foreign wheat, the factories' need for domestic wheat is even more sluggish. Fuxin Factory has announced another suspension of operations. Tiaofeng Factory is slightly more accommodating, but the market price has been reduced by a lot. The total volume of Jiangbei and Wuhu wheat sold in the market was 1,500 bags, with the highest price being 6.60 yuan, which is seven cents lower than before. The prices of all other wheat have been reduced by 70 to 100 cents.

Also, it is reported that various flour mills in this city have ordered a total of six ships of American wheat due to the lack of domestic wheat raw materials. In addition to the first ship ordered by Fuxin Factory, totaling 8,632 tons, which has already arrived, it is now learned that the second ship of wheat ordered by Fufeng Factory, totaling 7,500 tons, will arrive in Shanghai next Monday and Tuesday, the 23rd and 24th of this month. The third and fourth batches of wheat ordered will also arrive one after another.

### Round-Grain Rice, Original Package, Further Warehouse Stoppage, Improved Sales of Early Rice

Round-Grain Rice:

Yesterday, a total of sixty to seventy bags of Riverfront No. 4 round-grain rice arrived by train. Although initial sales were still sluggish, the situation was dire. Later, a large merchant suddenly stored the original package in the warehouse, and then shop customers in this street followed up and became active. The market color began to stabilize. As a result, thick and thin round-grain rice did not fluctuate much. Du Yang, Jianbu, and Jianjian also held the original prices. The sales channel for Yuan has not been as strong as before. The situation has become slack. There is no honor or disgrace.

Early Rice:

Yesterday, sales in the market turned weak, but the source of train shipments continues unabated. Yesterday, 1,490 bags were shipped from Xingang. Although the Nanjing, Wuhu, and Taizhou routes of machine-polished rice continued to be sold, the market continued to decline due to the sluggish appetite of importing traders. High-priced goods fell by nine cents, while medium-priced goods fell by six to five cents to nearly one jiao. However, brokers believe that production prices have risen, making it difficult to plan future purchases. Although the cost of goods arriving now is lower, transportation is difficult, and miscellaneous expenses are still high, so they are unwilling to devalue too much.

### Piece Goods: Strong Demand for Wrapping Cloth, Chinese Factories Increase the Number of Greige Fabrics, Dongpi Market Prices Continue to Rise

Domestic Cloth:

In recent days, the rise in flower yarn and Dongpi has been fierce, and the domestic cloth market has also been firm. Colored cloth and colored twill have strong demand from local and out-of-town merchants, so the asking price has been gradually increasing. The supply of greige fabrics has been supplemented, but the supply from Japanese factories is not strong, and there are concerns about insufficient supply from time to time. Chinese factories are also scouring for as much production as possible, so Chinese factories have been supplying bleaching and finishing greige fabrics. Sales of various brands of coarse cloth, fine twill, and fine cloth are scattered, but the supply is scarce, so supply and demand can still correspond. Yesterday, the market has turned firm. Factory prices are two to three jiao higher than market prices. 84 raw cloth is the most sought-after due to even less supply. The spring goods such as fu silk, satin, and stripe bleaching from February and March are being sought after by wholesale shops and bleaching and dyeing factories. The demand for greige fabrics is becoming more urgent, but factories have already accepted orders and the asking prices have increased sharply, making it difficult to approach. Therefore, they are also trying to hoard existing stocks, with many large transactions. The actual needs of customer merchants have been more active from Sichuan and Yunnan merchants recently, purchasing more than 300 boxes of Lan cloth, Qilin Ya cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and line ne from factories such as Huafeng, Tianyi, and Hongzhang. Guangdong merchants purchased more than 100 pieces of bleached cloth, colored twill, and fine twill. This street imported more than 100 bales of Yihe coarse cloth. Inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang purchased thousands of pieces of Lan cloth, colored twill, feather silk, serge, and zhihe. Sales from Wenzhou and Ningbo merchants are both weak, because of the inflexible financial turnover. The military situation in northern Hunan has signs of intensification, resulting in a wait-and-see attitude. Merchants from Shantou and Quanzhou purchased Lan cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and a small amount of zhibu and fine twill. Serge also reached a scale of 100 pieces.

Dong Cloth:

The market is thriving, and the prices continue to rise. Yesterday, the fine cloth and fine twill of various brands were because of continued strong demand from the main customer, and the traders were gradually running out of goods. The inventory of factories and warehouses is also weak. The market price is rising even faster. Fine cloth has risen by another five to seven and a half cents per piece compared to the previous day, and fine twill has risen by one jiao. Tianjin merchants have made about 1,000 transactions in a row. This street's dyed greige fabrics and various wholesale shops also purchased more than 1,000 pieces. The ocean banks opened goods slightly less. It is heard that Longtou fine twill opened with 50 pieces, at a price of 11.1 yuan per piece. The 300 bales of Caiqiu and Longtou brand fine cloth were priced at 11.55 yuan per piece.

Export:

Today's piece goods exports total 510 pieces shipped to Ningbo, and 510 pieces shipped to Shantou.

### North and South Goods: Jinshan Dried Tofu Sticks Arrive Scarcely

Jinshan dried tofu sticks have been in short supply recently. The shop price is firm and persistent. It was found that a batch was shipped from Hong Kong by the shop yesterday, with a total of only 64 boxes. The scarcity can be seen. It is heard that the asking price at the opening is higher than before, and no transaction has been made yet.

### Newly Built Shiitake Mushrooms Continue to Be Sold

Since the first batch of new goods of Fujian shiitake mushrooms were sold, there have been successive arrivals recently. However, the number of shipments has not been strong. Yesterday's opening prices were: ordinary thin mushrooms at 206.8 yuan, medium-grade at 208.8 yuan, and high-grade at 213.8 yuan.

### Double Act

— Lishi

In the storytelling world, there is "double swing," in general society, there is "double swing," and now on the international stage, there is also a "double act."

Some storytellers excel at telling jokes, and some excel at singing; those who excel at telling jokes but are not good at singing, or those who excel at singing but are not good at telling jokes, cannot sell out the seats: to attract a wide audience and become a successful and popular storyteller, they have to find a partner and combine their skills to achieve "both difficulties combined, four beauties possessed." One plays the pipa, one plucks the strings, one speaks, one sings; they speak of sorrows in a touching manner, and of joys in a humorous way, stealing the tears and sympathy of many listeners. And the motivation and purpose of their double act is only for "business acumen."

In general society, some are good at attacking, and some are good at defending; those who can attack but cannot defend, or those who can defend but cannot attack, cannot create a career or inherit the family business: to advance and to establish a career, they have to find a partner and combine their strengths; one charges into battle, one strategizes, one plays the good guy, one plays the bad guy, either in front or behind, either aggressively or slowly, as long as it meets the subjective conditions and objective needs, they can discuss and predetermine whether to go left or right, attack or defend. And the motivation and purpose of their double act is to seize. Find a partner, do a double act, one red, one white, one hard, one soft, one good, one bad, one spirited, one weird. Their motive is to fear they can't handle the other side alone, or they can't conveniently turn around if things go wrong, and their aim is to plot intimidation.

"Double act" has achieved factual success in all levels of society. Therefore, there is now also a "double act" being performed on the international political stage.

According to recent news reports, Italy wants to covet French territories in the Philippines, deploying troops and generals, building up its army, and using intimidating methods, as if it must get them. Germany is also simply in harmony, secretly and openly, a soft and hard, red and white, way of doing things. This continuous good show can only be considered to have just begun, and there are many more plays to come.

### Quick Sketch of a Restaurant Alley

— Yun San

In the Shanghai of the bustling foreign concession, it is indeed difficult for ordinary poor scholars to solve the four major problems of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Taking "food" alone, although many large restaurants are opened on the road, the golden signs of "Beijing Cuisine" and "Cantonese Food" are only allowed for the wealthy classes to enjoy. Under this urgent need, the restaurant alley was born, and it has always maintained its prosperous and lively situation.

Many people may wonder about the origin of the term "restaurant alley." I also asked a "old Shanghainese" in his seventies. He told me that when he first arrived in Shanghai, the restaurant alley already had some form. In this way, the long history of the restaurant alley has created its scale today, and it has indeed reached its golden age.

The restaurant alley is the common name of Cichang Lane on Nanjing Road. This is an old-fashioned lane, in addition to Nanjing Road, it also leads to Jiangxi Road in the west. There are also two exits on Sichuan Road on the east side. Because most of the lane is opened with small restaurants and noodle restaurants, it is familiar to everyone, and relying on its "cheap and beautiful" operation, it has attracted countless customers. Inside, there are Cantonese restaurants, local small restaurants, Hui Muslim restaurants, "Spare Rib Noodle King" specializing in pasta, Western-style coffee and bread shops, open-air "places for ordinary people to fill their stomachs," noodle shops baking flatbreads and fried dough sticks all day long, and rice cake stalls for people to gobble down. No matter what kind of person comes inside, they will find their favorite food, and no matter what kind of person, they will feel that they have exchanged enough food for a satisfactory and low price. This is truly the most "happy" event.

Clerks from foreign firms, students, workers, Indians, police officers, poor and destitute White Russians, and begging beggars are all regular customers here. There are college girls in leather coats, high heels, and permed hair, and smartly dressed "playboys." At noon, they all flock in together, and batches of people eat and leave, letting those waiting in line sit down to solve this big problem. If the weather is clear, there are "elegant seats" set up in the open air, and the entire alley is full of people. In one corner, there are many workers eating on the ground. White rice plus 30 cents of green vegetables solves the problem of hunger. Beggars lick fish bones and leftover rice bought for a copper coin at the entrance of the restaurant. White Russians eat vegetables with clumsy chopsticks in coffee shops. Indians eat hard bread. Everyone is desperately stuffing their stomachs to "live."

It usually costs two cents to go inside and eat very full. An economic meal costs two cents, plain noodles are five cents, a bowl of white rice is sixty cents, and tofu soup is two hundred and sixty cents. It is luxurious to spend three cents and eat happily. In addition, there are stalls selling oranges at the entrance. Buy a Tiantaishan honey tangerine for three cents and eat it all the way back, which makes people feel a little elated.

The restaurant alley is being praised. In this era of expensive rice and wages, it is indeed a good companion for the poor. Although the light is dim and the air is dirty inside, it is far from the scenery of the high-rise buildings of large restaurants, it gives people the same satisfying enjoyment. Its fame and its prosperity are certainly not accidental!

### Sixty Glorious Years

— Yanhua

"Sixty Glorious Years"

Produced by British Royal Company, Premiered at Cathay Theater

Making historical films is originally a very difficult task, because it is necessary to narrate decades of historical facts in a certain length of film, in fragments. This is of course a difficult thing. But we dare not say that historical films have absolutely no famous works, such as "The Private Life of Henry VIII" (starring Charles Laughton) and "Catherine the Great," which are based on British history, aren't they the masterpieces of historical films?

Therefore, we believe that historical films cannot not be made, but must ask how to deal with those heavy historical facts, and how to transform those historical facts that record the changes of the times from historical books into vivid and dramatic film art.

With the problem unfolded in front of us, we think there are the following kinds:

(1) How to make a script? - This work is the most important bridge for making historical films. Through this most difficult process, historical films are not difficult to make successfully. To answer this question, we can say that the screenwriter should use dramatic techniques to extract the essence of history, to strengthen it, to render it, to boldly discard those unnecessary details, and to try to enhance the theme of the entire film. For example, "Sixty Glorious Years" is about Queen Victoria's 60 years of political achievements. Many trivial scenes in the film can be discarded.

What about "Sixty Glorious Years"? We dare to say calmly that this historical film about the political achievements of "Queen Victoria" produced by the British Royal Film Company, although it spent a lot of capital and spent a lot of energy, is not an artwork in terms of the achievements of film art, but only a propaganda product promoting the history of the British Queen.

It is said that this film did well in foreign countries, but in terms of the Chinese situation, the film merchant seems to have estimated incorrectly. Using such a high ticket price to ask them to watch such a dull historical film, I am afraid it is not easy to grasp the audience.

What are the shortcomings of the screenwriting method of "Sixty Glorious Years"? First, the historical narrative is too repetitive. We can see this from the fact that Queen Victoria's own marriage and the marriage of the princess are completely the same; second, when the Queen and the Prince Consort dine, the two always look at their children through the window. Although the ages are completely different, the expression methods are exactly the same; apart from the first half of the play, which describes the Queen's life after marriage and is slightly lively and vivid, the playwright can only cut out fragments of history in the second half of the play and use them as an introduction to the institution. It cannot be accepted by the audience, and it is inevitable; third, the connection of ages is mostly done with subtitles, which makes the film fall into obscurity.

I believe that in making historical [films], the main thing is that the playwright should have a quick and intelligent mind, and he should understand how to extract and abandon those precious materials.

(2) We have to talk about the director. We are very clear that the main framework of historical films is the script, but the one that makes the film a lively and bright soul is the director. Why is "Marie Antoinette," which also wrote about a generation of female queens, so touching, and why is "Sixty Glorious Years," which also wrote about the most famous Victorian political achievements in British history, so bitter and dull? My answer is: in addition to the fact that "Sixty Glorious Years" includes too many historical facts that are not easy to deal with, at the same time, the skill of the director Will Wilcox of "Sixty Glorious Years" is too "British style."

From the skills he showed in this film, we can clearly see three points: first, his shots are always flat, and everything high-angle, low-angle, close-up shots, and all the beauty of the composition on the screen cannot be seen here.

Some people say that this represents the characteristics of the British nationality. They are equally conservative in their artworks and retain their slow "gentleman style." There is some reason for this explanation.

Second, there are no big scenes in the whole film. Perhaps the director is too concerned about the cost. There are many scenery that can be made into great scenes, but they are all shrunk in one corner; third, there are too many repetitive scenes, such as the way of marriage, dancing after marriage, etc.

But there are a few scenes in the whole film that still cannot be forgotten, such as the Queen's life after marriage; the charge of the British Royal Army; the Queen's visit to her old palace maid after holding the Diamond Jubilee, etc., are all very excellent.

Anna Neagle, who plays the Queen, is successful, and even better in her old age; Anton Walbrook is also excellent.

### Three Records of Ballad Singing

— Wei Mo

Seeing the Moon and Smiling

The ballad "Seeing the Moon and Smiling" in five volumes was acquired from a cold stall last year. It is fully titled "Newly Engraved Current Tune Seeing the Moon and Smiling, The Story of Miss Li Qianjin", published during the Qianlong era. The entire book's total number of volumes is unknown; this is the first volume with five chapters. The content tells the story of Zhang Huangliang, who, entrusted by his friend Xu Zifang, takes care of the latter's family and daughter, Li Qianjin. Soon after Zifang's departure to the capital, Huangliang encounters Li Qianjin and Hanxiang. Qianjin often sends Hanxiang to Zhang's house to play. Zhang's wife and son are very angry and slander Hanxiang. Zhang's wife even asks Hanxiang to deliver a warning to Qianjin. The story ends here in this incomplete volume. However, there are two points that sufficiently reveal the threads of the later story development: one is that Hanxiang returns home after being humiliated and conspires with Qianjin to persuade Huangliang to kill his own wife and son; the other is that a neighboring woman watches with a cold eye and agrees with Zhang's wife, unbeknownst to Huangliang. The great thing about the later story is that Zhang Huangliang indeed kills his wife and son, and the neighboring woman comes out to seek revenge, or perhaps she endures until Zifang returns after passing the imperial examination with high honors, and then exposes the affair, completing the karmic cycle. Although it is only an incomplete volume, the text and printing are excellent. It is a pity that the complete work cannot be seen. It is estimated that the complete edition of this book is at least four volumes and twenty chapters. The title inscription of the first volume has the line "Entrusted pleasure leads to evil retribution," revealing the key point.

Record of the Lion's Roar

Recently, I unintentionally bought a ballad called "Record of the Lion's Roar," which is a manuscript from the Xinwei year of Tongzhi (1871). It consists of six chapters, bound in three volumes. The content is exactly the same as the Kunqu opera. The chapter titles are: "Combing Hair," "Spring Outing," "Visiting a Courtesan," "Kneeling in a Dream," "Wandering Soul," and "Obedient Husband." The entire book is less than 20,000 words, making it a smaller work. It is unknown if there is a printed version.

Perhaps because it is based on the Kunqu opera, this "Record of the Lion's Roar" is actually different from ordinary ballads. It does not completely adopt the old ballad writing style. It emphasizes dialogue and lyrics. It can be said to be a new form, and this form is more powerful in performance.

The creation of this new form is the only advantage of this work. However, there are no particularly remarkable writing techniques. The only noteworthy aspect is that the satirical lyrics are sometimes very well conceived. All the filler words are also included, perhaps because it is a transcription of a performance script from that time.

Kun Love

In the popular Tongzhi edition of the ballad "The Story of a Righteous Demon," the twenty-first chapter is missing. Only from the last sentence of the previous chapter, "Listen to the tale of Kun's love in the next volume," can we know that the chapter title is "Kun Love."

A few years ago, I heard someone in a bookstore on Hulong Street say that there was a Jiaqing edition of this book, which was a complete edition, but not often seen, and that someone in Suzhou had a copy. Since then, I have been paying attention to finding it, and finally, last autumn, I unintentionally acquired it.

The book was published in the spring of the Ji Ji year of Jiaqing (1809). The Tongzhi edition was re-engraved based on this, and the layout is the same. The two chapters of "Kun Love" describe the meeting between Gu Jinyun and Xiaoqing.

There is a large amount of obscene description in the piece, starting from entering the room at dusk and narrating until the next morning, divided into paragraphs and steps, emphasizing the atmosphere created. It seems to be unseen in other books.

The printing is more refined than the Tongzhi edition, and the font is not as clumsy as the re-engraved version. It is printed on white powder paper. The other dozens of chapters are completely identical. I wonder if there is an earlier edition than the Jiaqing edition?

(Because the Master of Hangxie Studio has important matters and no time to write, the "Shanghai Anecdotes" column will be suspended for one issue.)

### Clear Sky After Rain

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 2: Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization, Guide Jin Eloquently Discusses the Concept of Equality

Originally, around the Cemetery of the Martyrs, there was a large park, as if embracing the cemetery in the middle. Therefore, people who came to this grand site could not only pay their respects to the martyrs' graves but also enjoy the park. Even the market outside, although not very prosperous, was quite elegant. Upon arriving there, Lin Jiancheng stopped the car and said to the two Miss He: "No vehicles are allowed beyond the memorial arch. This is the people's way of respecting the martyrs. Even the highest leader of the country must get out of the car here. What about us? Are you two ladies hungry? Should we pay our respects to the martyrs first and then come back to eat, or should we fill our stomachs first and then pay our respects?" The two Miss He said, "Naturally, we should go up and pay our respects to the martyrs first, and then eat and play." Lin Jiancheng said, "That's very good. There's a parking lot here. I'll park the car and accompany you up." At that moment, He Peiyu suddenly exclaimed, "Oh! We forgot something!" Miss Jin quickly asked, "What is it?" He Peiyu said, "Since we're paying our respects to the martyrs, we should bring some flowers. Shuangyu mentioned it last night, but we forgot when we came." Miss Jin smiled and said, "Don't worry, they have everything here. Whatever flowers you want, they have them. And all the styles are more elaborate than outside. I'll take you to buy them." At this time, Lin Jiancheng went to park the car, and Jin Danyun led the two of them to the flower shop to buy flowers. Along the way, they were still discussing: "Should we offer a wreath or a flower basket?" Miss Jin said, "I don't think wreaths or flower baskets are necessary. Just offer a bouquet of flowers. Either the two of you offer one bouquet together, or each of you offers a bouquet, whatever you prefer." As the three were talking, they arrived at the entrance of a flower shop. The storefront was not large, just a small room, but the glass windows displayed various famous flowers in a riot of colors. However, behind it was a large field, visible through a revolving door. Looking up, there was a plaque above with the four characters "Liufang Flower Garden" written in flamboyant strokes by Yu Huzi. This Liufang Flower Garden was the sign of that flower shop. The three entered the flower shop and found it quiet. Only an old woman with a pair of reading glasses was sitting on a rattan couch, doing her needlework. Miss Jin walked up to her and greeted her, "Mama Huang! How have you been these days?" The old woman turned her eyes from her needlework and said, "Oh! Miss Jin! Long time no see!" (18)

The Entertainment World

### A Comparison of the "Four Great Dan Actresses" of Peking Opera (Part 2)

— Xuehong Zhaizhu

Xun Huisheng: The cleverness of the Little Liuxiang Pavilion is no less than that of Mei and Cheng. He felt that Mei and Cheng's style was all about pursuing a grand demeanor, but the beauty of a petite maiden had its own merits. Therefore, he consistently maintained his "smart and pretty" style, and as expected, he was greatly praised by the music connoisseurs. Huisheng's voice belongs to the yu tone, singing in a very low key, but with a winding and charming quality. Moreover, she has a graceful figure and her eyes are full of affection, making her very lovable. In addition, her skill in stepping on qiao (stilts) is the best among the four great dan actresses. No one else can match her when performing the role of a comic female character.

Shang Xiaoyun: The sweetness of Lanfang and Huisheng's voices is certainly welcomed by music connoisseurs, and the bitterness of Yanqiu's voice is also appreciated by listeners, but they can only produce soft and weak tones, and cannot sing crisp and clear phrases. This is why Xiaoyun formed her own unique style. Xiaoyun's voice belongs to the gong tone, and her singing has both "crispness" and "clarity." I once heard Xiaoyun sing the line "Cut off the thread of the loom..." in "San Niang Teaches Her Son," which was decisive and without any compromise. This is something that Mei and Xun certainly could not do, and even Yanqiu might not be able to achieve such directness. Therefore, the four characters "echoing in the clouds" are probably very difficult to find a more suitable person for other than Xiaoyun. Moreover, Xiaoyun's martial arts skills are unmatched among the four great dan actresses. The four characters "proficient in both civil and martial arts" can also be applied to Xiaoyun without any shame.

In short, Lanfang is dignified and graceful, natural and generous, completely in the style of a noble lady, making her most suitable for playing the princess in "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and Yang Yuhuan in "Tai Zhen Outer Biography"; Yanqiu is steady and dignified, secluded and virtuous, like a lady from a wealthy family, making her most suitable for playing Dou E in "Golden Lock Record" and Su San in "The Joint Trial"; Huisheng is graceful and charming, smart and amorous, perfectly embodying a petite maiden, making her the only one suitable for plays such as "Hong Luan Xi" and "Hua Tian Cuo"; Xiaoyun is resolute and decisive, like a female hero, making her perfectly suited for playing Wang Chun'e in "San Niang Teaches Her Son" and He Yufeng in "Thirteen Sisters." But Lanfang can be gentle but not strong, Yanqiu can be sad but not enchanting; Huisheng can be angry but not shrewish; Xiaoyun can be strong but not charming. This is why the four great dan actresses each have their own strengths and specializations.

### The Taishan Cantonese Opera Troupe Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon; A Conversation with Liao Shijie; Dong Zhiyang and Others Also Returned to Shanghai at the Same Time

The Taishan Cantonese Opera Troupe, invited by the Gengxin Stage and Xiang Sheng Company, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the Shandong liner. The performers, totaling more than sixty men and women, are staying at the Xin Xin Hotel and backstage at the Gengxin Stage. I immediately went to Xin Xin for an interview and was received by Mr. Liao Shijie of the troupe. According to his account, after the fall of Guangzhou, most Cantonese opera performers fled to Hong Kong, and the troupe was also performing in Hong Kong. They had seriously considered accepting the invitation to come to Shanghai, as they feared being deceived and performing in the occupied area of western Shanghai. They were later informed that the performance would be in the public concession, so there was no problem. Originally, they were scheduled to perform tonight (i.e., last night) after arriving in Shanghai, but most of the actors are suffering from seasickness and are very tired from the journey, so they need to rest a little. Moreover, they must rehearse the music before performing, so that they can achieve excellent results; if they act carelessly, it would not be appropriate for the troupe to damage its reputation after coming all the way here. Although they heard that there were many reservations, they could only postpone it for one day. As for the actors' accommodations, except for the laoguan (leading actor), who lives separately, the rest all stay backstage so that the actors can study the plays together, which is more convenient than living scattered. After chatting to this point, I took my leave.

(Latest News) The troupe has already performed last night.

Also, Dong Zhiyang, an actor from Gu Wuwei's Standard Opera Troupe, and child actors Eight-Year-Old Red and Nine-Year-Old Red also returned to Shanghai on the Shandong liner yesterday.

### Yuan Shouzhong's Entertainment

— Chou Cheng

Mr. Yuan Ludeng is fond of wine and Peking opera. He sings the laosheng (old male) roles. When he first joined the Yage Society, he was elected as the president. Later, when the committee system was adopted, he became the chairman of the committee. Although he bears great social expectations, he still retains his scholarly nature and is amiable and approachable, so everyone calls him Mr. Goody-Goody and addresses him as Grandpa Yuan to his face, almost becoming everyone's grandpa. When he is tipsy and excited, he often puts on makeup and performs on stage with his friends, indulging in the joy of it. He can handle plays such as "Yellow Crane Tower," "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Vermilion Mole," "Baolian Lantern," and "Four Plateaus," and his movements and singing are not planned in advance, but naturally fit the occasion on the spot, making him a natural performer. His son, Mr. Senzhai, also enjoys amateur opera, singing the wusheng (male martial) role of Huang Tianba in "Luoma Lake." He is heroic and dashing, and not only are his performances skillful, but also his voice is loud and clear. The amateur opera community all believes that he is a special talent who can cross over to professional performance. Mr. Du Yuesheng greatly appreciates him and has given him a lot of costumes. On the 18th of this month, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, and Xu Jiluo organized a celebration at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association to celebrate Mr. Ludeng's 60th birthday. In order to aid our compatriots, they stipulated that no gifts would be accepted, and each friend who attended would contribute five yuan in national currency. After deducting the cost of the silver screen and the banquet expenses, the remainder would be donated to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. More than a thousand people attended, and there was even a "full house" sign posted downstairs. People in the entertainment world all have a good impression of this Mr. Goody-Goody and are willing to offer performances to entertain the guests. Due to time constraints, only Zhang Ye'er and others performed a scene from the new "Hong Luan Xi," and Jiang Xiaoxiao and Bao Lele sang a comedic segment together. Ballad singer Zhu Yaoxiang planned to sing a short story, but due to lack of time, he and Huang Zhaolin, who tells long stories, switched gears and performed a segment from "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," which was quite unique and set a precedent in the storytelling world. No wonder Lin Kanghou said in his speech that Mr. Yuan has always been very enthusiastic about local public welfare. This time, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, organized under the leadership of Yu Qiao, invited him to serve as the secretary-general and offered him travel expenses, but he firmly declined, saying that although he was poor, he should devote himself entirely to the cause of the refugees, and he would put aside everything else to focus on his duties, and he would be stationed at the association full-time. Today, people from all walks of life have come to participate in the public celebration, all respecting and congratulating him. I also came to make a joke and say a few words, that this day is not in vain for him to be Mr. Goody-Goody, and so on. When Mr. Yuan thanked the guests, he stated that encouraged by his friends and relatives, he would work even harder in the future to benefit the public and asked them to rest assured that he would not let down their good intentions today. During the impromptu singing and fundraising on the spot, Mr. Yu Yefeng first donated one hundred yuan in silver dollars and asked the birthday star to sing an old tune. Mr. Yuan immediately went on stage and sang the entire segment of "Returning Zhao to the Original State," with deep meaning, and everyone applauded. Mr. Yu Qiaqing also donated one hundred yuan and asked the birthday star to sing the second line of "Vermilion Mole," "Admonish everyone in the world to be kind and honest," and everyone praised him for not forgetting his roots, and everyone was moved. Then, some donated fifty yuan, and others donated thirty yuan, for a total of two thousand two hundred yuan. Finally, Mr. Yuan Senzhai sang a segment from "Golden Stage," in order to bring good luck and follow the intention of Lao Laizi entertaining his parents. His tone was very clear and full of charm, earning a lot of applause, truly a grand and elegant occasion.

### Lin Ruxin Fell and Was Hospitalized

— (Taoyuan Sanren)

Speaking of Lin Ruxin, I think many readers may still remember this performer who was once active on the stage and screen. At that time, her husband, Gu Wuwei, ran the Great China Film Company in Shanghai (the studio was located in Xingjiazhai, Zhabei), and the films he produced, such as "Red Boy" in "Journey to the West" and the social drama "Clear Sky After Rain" (Clear Sky After Rain was the first Chinese sound film, the sound was recorded in Japan, but it was very rudimentary). All the protagonists in the films were played by Lin Ruxin and her daughter, Gu Baolian. For a period of time, Gu Wuwei took over the Gong Stage and performed the "Lotus Princess" serial plays, with Lin and Gu as the main actors, as well as Ms. Lu Cuilan. Lu was a member of the Jiande Society and an amateur opera performer, and she later married Gu as well. A few years ago, Gu took over the Qitian Stage and staged the play "The Sorrowful Comedy," with Lu as the protagonist.

Before the outbreak of the war, Gu Wuwei went to Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places to perform. However, two years ago, he took Lu Cuilan to Hong Kong, while Lin Ruxin still lived in Shanghai (Gu Xianlian was also married). She retired from the stage and screen and lived a leisurely life. Now, Gu Wuwei suddenly returned from Hong Kong with Lu Cuilan, thinking of coming to Shanghai to recruit talent for films and dramas, preparing to stage a drama in Hong Kong during the lunar New Year. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai, he and Lu Cuilan went to contact various parties separately.

A few days ago, Gu met with several friends from the film and drama circles at the Atlantic Restaurant to discuss the issue of recruiting talent. Lin Ruxin also went with him, but Lin was wearing a pair of very high heels that day, so when she stepped up the stairs, she barely made it halfway up the escalator before falling headfirst. Her face happened to scrape against the ground, removing a large patch of skin, resulting in a bloody mess and a terrible sight. She was immediately sent to the hospital. It is said that the wound is now inflamed, and even if it heals, it will still leave a scar.

### Zui Yixian Retires

The female ballad singer Zui Yixian, due to her melancholy and ill health, has long since retired from the ballad singing scene and only broadcasts on the radio. Recently, her stomach illness has flared up again, and she has disappeared from the radio as well, with her sister Yixian taking her place. Her brother Ni Chang has accepted an invitation from Chunhe Teahouse in Zhongshi Street, Suzhou, to perform during the lunar New Year season, starting in early February of the Gregorian calendar, and will travel with Yixian. Zui Yixian and her mother will remain in Shanghai. However, she has now retired from the ballad singing and radio scenes, and it is unknown when we will see her beautiful face again.

A Glimpse of the Dance World

### Small Dance Halls

There are too many small dance halls to remember. Some sell dance tickets for seven yuan per yuan, some for ten yuan, and some even for sixteen yuan. The facilities vary slightly, but in general, they are just mediocre.

Along Chaqiang Road, neon signs such as Far East, Jue Lu, and Great Eastern are everywhere. I have only visited the Far East, and its decorations are not inferior to the Yangtze River. Among the dancers, there is one named Li Na who also dances at Lidu at night. She can be considered an average performer in the Lidu dance team, but in the Far East, she does not stand out from the crowd.

The small dance halls on Foch Road can be considered the best in this category. They sell tickets for ten yuan per yuan, which is suitable for thrifty customers. They also have secluded elegant seats on the upper floor, with seating at three yuan per hour, which is quite fun for intimate conversations. Even those who frequent high-end dance halls are happy to visit. There are not many dancers, because their income is not lower than that of mid-level dance halls. I think the organizers have a very clear mind, because they must ensure that both the dancers and the customers benefit, and then the income of the dance hall can be guaranteed.

I have also set foot in the Huilingden on Beijing Road, and it happened to be the occasion of dancing with women in bathrobes, which was very popular. However, among Chinese women, very few have the right combination of fat and thin muscles and short and long bones to meet the standards of beauty. Therefore, there is a saying that three parts of talent and seven parts of dressing. If the limbs are exposed, it will further highlight the flaws. It may be pleasing to the rogues, but difficult to attract the elegant scholars. The music is only provided by three or four people, sometimes playing Peking opera, but the rhythms are inaccurate and the tempos are uneven. Moreover, playing Peking opera with Western music is like playing Western tunes with a Peking fiddle, which ultimately feels out of place. The way of music is to value harmony, and it is impossible to create pleasing music through forced and disjointed means.

### Secret History of the Palace and Opera World of the Former Capital (81)

Lu Sanbao Sings "Drunken Concubine" with Lao Tan as Gao Lishi

The play "Drunken Concubine" is truly one that people never tire of listening to. The slow tempo of the huqin is enough to intoxicate people. In addition, the palace-style costume of the dan actor, holding a young lady's fan (in the past, they did not hold this fashionable fan, it was probably an ivory stock with a golden face), the fan is thrown out as she enters the stage, and she squats down, then begins to sing "An isolated icy wheel..." The melody is truly indescribably beautiful, so my favorite dan role is this one. Although the current Four Great Dan Actresses all have this play, their foundation in waist and leg work is not as good as Xiao Cui's (Xiao Cui is Xiao Cuihua, her real name is Yu Lianquan).

It is said that Xiao Cui's "Drunken Concubine" was learned from the famous dan actress Lu Sanbao (zi Yushan) of the past. Sanbao was most famous for performing this play back then. The delicacy of her expressions and the beauty of her postures were beyond description. Especially the real skills like "bending over backwards" and "lying down like a fish." If you haven't practiced hard since childhood, you will surely sweat profusely, and if you are not careful, you may fall down and not be able to get up. What's more, Lu Sanbao had to step on qiao when performing this play, which was an even better test of her true skills. The current Four Great Dan Actresses, except for Xun Huisheng who can barely manage to step on qiao, the rest of them should just take their tricks back home and "put away their monkeys."
