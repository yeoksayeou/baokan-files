(Hong Kong) Amid thunderous applause, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech at the opening of the People's Political Council, stating in brief: The fall of the Song and Ming dynasties was not due to a lack of capable individuals. There were quite a few good generals at the time, but due to selfishness and internal disagreements among officials, the nation ultimately fell. Now, our country has been resisting Japan for one year and seven months, consuming much of the enemy's strength. Although we have lost several provinces, we believe that if all compatriots are united in heart and mind and sacrifice personal freedom to fight for national freedom, we will surely achieve final victory. In the future, we hope that all compatriots will concentrate material and financial resources and take active actions. We also hope that members of the People's Political Council will cooperate sincerely, uphold the spirit of the previous two conferences, jointly shoulder responsibilities, and carry through to the end to plan the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction. I, Zhongzheng, am deeply honored to serve as chairman and hope that colleagues will provide corrections at any time. Chairman Lin's speech was read by Wang Shijie on his behalf.

(Hong Kong) According to news from foreign missionaries on Hainan Island, Japanese troops are gradually occupying the northern coast of the island.

(Special dispatch on the 17th)

(Location unspecified) Women and children in towns and villages along the coast of Qiongzhou Island are now fleeing into the mountains. Japanese aircraft have been bombing Ding'an, Jinjiang, and nearby towns and villages in rotation for days, destroying countless houses. Yaxian and Lingshui were also bombed this morning. Such brutal acts by the Japanese only make the people on the island hate them even more. The people of Qiongzhou have no choice but to fight heroically and seek survival from death. (Dispatch on the 16th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese military sources on Hainan Island, Japanese troops have invaded the interior from the coast of Hainan Island, and Japanese aircraft are also flying around bombing various counties on the island. The bombed areas include Wenchang, Ding'an, Yaxian, Lingshui, and Tengqiao. Residents near the coast are currently retreating into the mountains. The vanguard of the Japanese army is now advancing southeast along the highway from Haikou and is said to have reached the outskirts of Wenchang. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

(Hong Kong) It has been officially confirmed here that Japanese troops occupied Nantou, three miles from British territory, this morning. Refugees are now thronging across the border. This move by the Japanese has not attracted deep attention. The news received is very brief. Some say that about 300 Japanese troops landed, while others say that the Japanese landing was only to replenish their military supplies. According to reports, Japanese troops also occupied the area in November of last year and then withdrew voluntarily. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

(Hong Kong) According to reliable foreign sources, eight more Japanese warships arrived outside Beihai Port last night, and seven Japanese warships arrived in the Bailongwei and Jinsha areas of Fangcheng. Foreign observers believe that the Japanese attempt to land in Fangcheng and Beihai is imminent. According to Chinese sources, a Japanese troop did land at Xin Jiao Di in Xuwen County two days ago, and returned to the ship after a few hours. Currently, Haian and Xuwen are as peaceful as usual, but Japanese aircraft fly over from time to time for reconnaissance. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 17th)

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese reports, fierce fighting is still ongoing in Chengmai, Jinjiang, and Xincheng in the northwest of Hainan Island this morning. General Wang Yi, the commander of the Qiongzhou Island Defense, is personally directing operations on the front lines in the northwest of the island and has ordered the Chinese troops on other lines to resist to the end. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 17th)

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, fierce battles are still ongoing in various coastal areas of Hainan Island. In order to preserve their strength, Chinese troops have gradually retreated inland. General Wang Yi has ordered the mobilization of all young men and civilians on the island and is determined to engage in guerrilla warfare with the invading enemy troops to the end. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 17th)

(Hong Kong) According to Guangzhou Bay Telegraph, the Japanese suffered heavy losses when they landed at Yulin Port and attacked Yazhou. The Japanese side has announced that Yazhou has been occupied, but according to Chinese sources, Yazhou is still under contention. According to news from Tokyo, a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy Ministry told foreign reporters yesterday that Japan's landing on Hainan Island was to stop the "smuggling" of Chinese military supplies, so there is no need to occupy the entire island, and it is only necessary to occupy some important locations. However, foreign media believe that the Japanese army was forced to make this deceptive statement because it encountered unexpectedly strong resistance and no longer intends to occupy the entire island. Therefore, the Japanese army has been unable to open up transportation between Haikou and Yulin and can only use naval aircraft as a means of transportation. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 17th)

(Chongqing) According to a Chinese military officer who told the Associated Press reporter, in addition to the strong resistance from the regular Chinese army on Hainan Island, thousands of residents and Li people who moved to Hainan Island from Guangdong have also been mobilized to fight against the Japanese army. The Chinese army is now building a strong defense area in the Wuzhi Mountains in central Hainan Island to prevent the Japanese army from occupying the entire island. (Associated Press dispatch on the 17th)

### Japanese Troops Land at Nantou on the Border of Hong Kong. Chinese Troops are Surrounding and Counterattacking.

(Hong Kong) More than 300 Japanese troops stationed in Humen and Taiping invaded Bao'an for the second time on the afternoon of the 16th. By about 6:00 AM on the 17th, they had occupied Huangsonggang and Nantou City and sent a puppet Bao'an County Magistrate. As of 7:00 PM on the 16th, they had not yet withdrawn from Bao'an County. Chinese troops are encircling them. It is also rumored that Japanese troops landed in the Dapeng area. People in Shenzhen have fled to the British territory again, and shops have closed their doors one after another. County Magistrate Liang Baoren stated that Ushi Yan, Xixiang, Huangtian, Guxu, and other places outside Huangsonggang and Nantou have also been harassed by Japanese troops. The rumor of Japanese troops landing in Dapeng Bay is a rumor. (Special dispatch at 1:00 PM on the 18th)

### Japan Threatens Western Democratic Countries. Takes a Challenging Stance Towards France.

(London) The Times criticized the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island in an editorial, saying that this is another act of breaking faith. Breaking faith has become a common occurrence in Tokyo. Do the current rulers of Japan also know that such reckless actions will one day endanger their country and the imperial family? The occupation of Hainan Island is a challenging stance aimed at threatening Western democratic countries, especially France. Therefore, this move should be reviewed. It is no longer a secret that Germany and Italy have recently exerted all their pressure in the Far East on Japan, hoping that Japan would take action that could enhance the purpose of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Undoubtedly, this persuasion prompted the decision of the highest Japanese authorities. If the wishes of Germany and Italy were not fully in line with the ultimate desires of the Japanese Navy and some urgent needs related to the war against China, Japan would not have made this decision immediately. As for the claim that the occupation of Hainan is a military necessity, this method can be used occasionally. If it is done repeatedly, it will only be an improper excuse. The progress of Japan's ambition to realize its ambition has been quite slow and uncertain recently. The main battlefield in the military situation has stagnated, and there has been no progress in the merger or strengthening of the puppet regime. At the same time, the Chinese army is still lined up to wait, and the morale of the Chinese people is still resolute and unyielding. The Chinese map has not yet seen a military goal that can change the war situation after being occupied and destroyed. Although Britain and the United States have been repeatedly deceived, they are still continuing to endure, and have not imposed economic sanctions on Japan, which could be the greatest external danger for Tokyo. But how long can this patience last? Even the extremely arrogant Japanese must sometimes worry about this. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

Xuwen: According to diplomatic circles, the Japanese side, feeling the threat from French warships, specifically expressed to the French side that the attack on Hainan Island was a temporary military strategy. As soon as the Japanese army arrives in Guilin, they will withdraw. However, the French side believes that the Japanese have no credibility and, in view of the Japanese's unreasonable and disrespectful behavior, does not believe what the Japanese say. Annan is now increasing the mobilization of various military services and police forces. In addition to a team of cruisers that has sailed to the Xisha and Hainan line, many elite troops have also arrived at designated locations to garrison. (Dispatch on the 16th)

Beihai: Three to five Japanese aircraft have been circling over the southwest of Weizhou Island for days, seemingly reconnaissance of the French fleet's movements in Tokyo Bay. Merchant ships sailing from Hong Kong's sea defense to Beihai, regardless of nationality, have been pursued by Japanese warships. The goods carried, mostly grain, have been robbed. (Dispatch on the 16th)

(London) Regarding the Hainan Island issue, Japanese newspapers have vehemently attacked Britain and France. The Asahi Shimbun even accused Foreign Minister Arita of not issuing a statement to the British and French ambassadors that there was no territorial ambition. British and French political figures commented that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is not temporary in nature. As Foreign Minister Arita claimed, its purpose is to threaten the interests of Britain and France in the Far East and to support Italy's threat to France. This can be clearly demonstrated in the arguments of Japanese newspapers. The policies of the Germany-Italy-Japan Axis are indeed regrettable, and this can be seen here. As for British officials, they originally treated the guarantees provided by Foreign Minister Arita with a suspicious attitude. Now they do not consider the arguments of Japanese newspapers to be different or comment on them. According to well-informed sources, Japan's true attitude has now been revealed and should be closely monitored. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

(Paris) Responsible persons do not consider the proud words made by Japanese newspapers on the Hainan Island issue to be different. It is said that newspapers in that country often use such arguments when they have military victories in China, which is commonplace. Unexpectedly, the Asahi Shimbun, which has always been known for its prudence, also criticized Foreign Minister Arita, saying that his attitude was too mild, which shows that there must be someone instructing behind the scenes. Political figures say that Japan's official policy is actually no different from the attitude of the newspapers. The newspapers have now issued warnings, saying that the motivation for occupying Hainan Island is less for military needs and more for political goals towards French territory. This has completely destroyed the explanations made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Upon hearing the news, French public opinion has realized Japan's true intentions. Britain and France should strengthen cooperation to deal with it, and other countries that are also threatened should do the same. In addition, the German and Italian ambassadors to Japan had contact with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs before the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island. The intention can be seen from the arguments of Japanese newspapers. In short, Japan's current policy is part of the common policy of the signatories to the Anti-Comintern Pact. The hints made by Japanese newspapers about suppressing Britain and France are in the same vein as Italy's natural desires and Germany's colonial demands. In France, dealing with Japan is the same as dealing with Germany and Italy. In other words, treat arrogant words with calmness, and deal with those who share the risk of being criticized and take practical actions with the most determined attitude. That's all. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

Hanoi: Recently, two new-style three-engine heavy bombers flew to Tangge, 30 miles from Hanoi. France's defenses in Annan have continued to increase. These bombers are the same as the bombers that flew to Vietnam and Tokyo at the end of last year to increase defenses. Each aircraft carries eight crew members and has a range of 1,125 miles. These new aircraft flew from France via Tunisia, Egypt, Persia, India, and Siam. When they arrived, a large number of soldiers, led by Vietnamese Air Force officers, welcomed them at the airport.

Editorial

### Jointly Defending the Far East

The protests of Britain and France against the Japanese invasion of Hainan Island have failed. Japan not only continues to use empty words of having no territorial intentions to prevaricate, but also goes back on its word and openly declares that it will turn Hainan Island into a military base to control the Pacific Ocean. Tokyo newspapers are even waving flags and shouting, threatening Britain and France, saying: The purpose of Japan's invasion of Hainan Island is to control the transportation between Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam, and to prevent British and French military supplies from entering China; if Britain and France do not wake up, Japan will further occupy land outside Hainan Island. Due to this statement, it can be seen that Japan no longer has any scruples about Britain and France, and the hideous face of the aggressor has been completely exposed.

The Japanese invasion of Hainan Island is another manifestation of the active aggression of the fascist group against democratic countries. After helping the Spanish rebels capture Barcelona, Germany and Italy are also trying to occupy Minorca Island to compete with Britain and France for hegemony in the Mediterranean. However, Chamberlain and Daladier are still indulging in appeasement policies. Japan sees that Britain and France have no movement in Europe, so they also come up with a trick, first invading Hainan Island to test their attitude towards the Far East incident. Afterwards, they saw that Britain and France only made a protest, only asking to explain the purpose, nature and duration of the invasion of Hainan Island, and did not take active action. They seized the opportunity and further decided to turn Hainan Island into a military base the day after providing assurances of no territorial intentions.

Japan's turning Hainan Island into a military base not only puts Tokyo Bay under its control, making the powerful naval and air base that France is building there seriously threatened, but also makes French Annan unable to move. At the same time, the traffic of British Hong Kong and Singapore is also cut off. Hong Kong is originally Singapore's forward base in military terms. Once its traffic with Singapore is cut off, its military position is completely lost, and Britain's interests in South China cannot be preserved. Not only that, Japan's turning Hainan Island into a naval base also allows it to cut off the connection between Hawaii and Pearl Harbor and prevent the United States from developing in the Pacific. Threatening the Philippines, advancing into Borneo, and further east, the Dutch East Indies are also under its control. Borneo is a large island in the South Seas, one-quarter of which belongs to Britain and three-quarters of which belongs to the Netherlands. Most of the kerosene and coal products necessary for Japanese fleets, merchant ships, and factories are taken from here. The Dutch East Indies, to the east of Borneo, is rich in resources and has not been developed, and has long been coveted by Japan. Therefore, if this plan of Japan succeeds, not only will Britain and France feel threatened, but the United States and the Netherlands will also be unable to rest easy.

The facts are in front of us, and the promise of no territorial intentions provided by Japan has been shattered by its own actions. Its invasion of Hainan Island is the beginning of the implementation of its southward policy, which is also the beginning of seizing the interests of Britain, France, the United States, and the Netherlands in the Pacific. Now France knows that this threat cannot be underestimated and has suggested to Britain that the two sides' staff departments conduct talks to discuss further joint defense strategies in the Far East, and Dutch Foreign Minister Patijn is also discussing cooperation with British Foreign Minister Halifax on defense strategies. British MP Graham and others are also strongly advocating retaliation against Japan to protect British interests in the Far East. However, the attitude of the British gentlemen is still hesitant. It is important to know that protesting against aggressors alone is no longer useful, especially against Japan, which has no credibility. Therefore, unless Britain, France, the United States, and the Netherlands are willing to voluntarily give up all their rights in the Pacific, we must take active action to stop Japan's aggression in order to protect our own interests.

(Tokyo) A foreign reporter asked at a press conference this morning, saying that the Japanese army's invasion of Hainan Island was not so much for military needs as it was related to enhancing the common defense. Is this true? Did Japan notify Germany and Italy in advance about the invasion of the island, as reported in foreign newspapers? A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that Japan invaded the island purely for strategic needs, and the Japanese government never notified any country in advance about the war on the island. The reports in foreign newspapers are not credible. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)

(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, due to the fact that Annan has been under very serious threat since the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, France has increased its land army by 35,000 to 55,000, sent a team of submarines and cruisers each, and two squadrons of aircraft to Annan to increase its defense.

### The East Indies May Be Attacked: The Brilliant Vision of the Dutch Communist Leader

The Hague: When the Dutch Parliament met today, Communist leader Aftink spoke about the importance of Hainan Island as a possible base for Japan to attack the Dutch East Indies. It is said that the Dutch East Indies is now within easy reach of Japan, and local scholars should be urged to join the colonial defense system, cooperate with each other, and the authorities should be required to take measures to resist Japanese spies in the area. However, Dutch East Indies military expert General Bachdu said that he did not underestimate the military importance of Hainan Island to Japan in the event of a war in the Pacific, but he believed that Japan was preoccupied with the war against China and could not care about other things, so he personally had no fear of the Dutch colony.

### The Chinese Air Force is Active: The Japanese Command in Wenxi was Bombed; Japanese Troops in Jin, Su, and Anhui Provinces were Repeatedly Attacked

(Chongqing) News has arrived here of the recent activity of the Chinese Air Force. A squadron of Chinese bombers bombed Japanese warships concentrated in Wuhu, during which one aircraft crashed into and sank a Japanese warship, perishing along with it.

Japanese Aircraft Attack Shaanxi, Suffering Heavy Damage

[Omitted] On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, it was reported that twenty-six Japanese aircraft flew over Shaanxi, intending to attack Lanzhou.

An investigation revealed that the Chinese side suffered no losses from the two bombings. The Japanese aircraft, under heavy attack from the Chinese aircraft and anti-aircraft units, were extremely panicked. The Chinese aircraft pursued them thoroughly until near Bapan Mountain before returning safely to base. At the time, several Japanese aircraft were seen teetering, with plumes of black smoke, fleeing in a disheveled state.

### National Government Issues Orders to Rectify Official Conduct: Current Political Construction Should Progress Simultaneously with Military Affairs; Civil Servants Must Respect Laws and Regulations and Cultivate Integrity; Do Not Think It Permissible to Acquire by Deceit or Advantageous to Enrich Oneself; Superiors Should Lead by Example and Expose Corrupt Subordinates

(Chongqing) On the 17th, the National Government issued an order stating that the nation's failures are often due to corrupt officials. Without punishing corruption, how can governance be achieved? Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the government has been planning and deliberating on fundamental strategies, believing that to resist foreign aggression, domestic affairs must first be rectified, and the strict enforcement of integrity and the rectification of discipline are particularly urgent tasks. The "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Corruption" have been formulated, promulgated, and implemented, and orders have been issued to the heads of all agencies to implement strict prevention and conduct thorough investigations. The integrity of officials is closely related to the prosperity and decline of politics and the well-being of the people. At this critical moment of national crisis, all officials should deeply understand the difficulties of the time and be even more vigilant. If financial management is even slightly ambiguous, the people's doubts will multiply, and there will be no hope for reform in public finances and administration. Moreover, as the current situation of the War of Resistance is becoming more favorable, political construction should progress simultaneously with military affairs. It is even more unacceptable for unscrupulous officials to engage in corruption and dereliction of duty, increasing the suffering of the people and hindering the implementation of national policies. Therefore, this special order reiterates the previous orders and issues strict warnings. All civil servants must respect laws and regulations and cultivate integrity; do not think it permissible to acquire by deceit or advantageous to enrich oneself. Know that civil law may be evaded, but national law is difficult to escape. Those who engage in malfeasance for personal gain will inevitably be exposed one day. If they dare to try again, bringing misfortune upon themselves, the government, once aware, will surely enforce the law. All superiors are responsible for supervising and directing their subordinates and should lead by example, preventing problems before they arise. Those subordinate officials who are greedy for wealth and whose conduct is untrustworthy must be exposed and eradicated at any time, so that corruption is eliminated and proper governance is achieved, thus fulfilling the government's intention to rectify official conduct and reform the bureaucracy. This order. (Dispatch of the 17th)

### Three Months of Hard Fighting by the Chinese Army in Hebei; Over Three Thousand Japanese Casualties; The So-Called "Mopping-Up" Plan Has Been Smashed

(Luoyang) Since mid-November of last year, the Japanese army in Hebei assembled approximately ten thousand Japanese and puppet troops, equipped with mechanized weapons, in an attempt to "mop up" the strength of the Chinese army in the central Hebei, southern Hebei, and western Hebei areas. The garrison troops in various areas of the Chinese army fought back separately, responding with tactical methods. Statistics show that in three months, over one hundred and fifty battles of various sizes occurred with the Japanese army. The commander of the Japanese army, Gujian, and the first battalion commander of the 110th Regiment, Major Konishi, as well as the puppet army commander Liu Huchen and others were killed.

Xingji Military News: (1) When Japanese soldiers send letters back home, they often describe the heroic resistance spirit of the Chinese army and civilians, and their anti-war and homesick sentiments are overflowing on the page. This has undermined Japanese propaganda and caused the atmosphere of anti-war sentiment among the people to increase daily.

In addition, the Japanese army in North China has changed its food supply to local collection. Military economic departments have been set up in Tianjin, Jinan, Beiping, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou and other places to collect food in batches, causing food prices to rise sharply in various parts of North China.

Afterwards, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement: "U.S. Ambassador Grew personally visited Foreign Minister Arita at his residence at 5:30 this afternoon to inquire about the Japanese government's true intentions in occupying Hainan Island. The ambassador said that although the United States does not have a consulate on the island, there are American residents and American missionaries on the island, so the United States also has a general interest in Hainan Island." The Foreign Minister immediately replied that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island was to strengthen the Japanese military's blockade of the South China coast. The U.S. Ambassador and the Foreign Minister discussed for fifteen minutes before departing. (Dispatch of the 17th)

### European Situation Improves; London Filled with Optimistic Atmosphere; Britain to Seek Economic Closeness with Russia; Foreign Secretary Announces Decision on Policy toward Spain; Assurances from Italy that Withdrawal of Volunteers Will Be Satisfactory

(London) The Conservative Party Foreign Affairs Committee recently held a meeting today. Foreign Secretary Halifax attended and explained the international situation, stating briefly that the Cabinet has decided in principle to recognize the National Army government of Spain, and has authorized the Prime Minister and himself to formally notify the National Army government of Spain of this decision at an appropriate time. This time is not far off, and once the National Army government is formally recognized, efforts will be made to promote peace between the parties involved in the Spanish civil war. This report by the Foreign Secretary has already created an optimistic impression. People in the lounges of the Parliament say that the European situation has improved since the past few weeks. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

(London) A political reporter for the Manchester Guardian declared that Foreign Secretary Halifax, when addressing the Conservative Party Foreign Affairs Committee last night, said, "We can now become estranged from the Soviet Union" and further hinted that Britain may need to forge closer economic ties with the Soviet Union. The meeting was not open to the public, but the reporter learned that the entire international situation was reviewed at the meeting. It was heard that the committee was greatly gratified by the Foreign Secretary's firm statement that the goal of British government policy was to do so. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

(London) Foreign Secretary Simon said in a speech at the dinner of the British Iron and Steel Industry Federation in London today, "The national mood of hope for peace is gradually becoming more solid, and now everyone can perceive this increasing confidence in the air. This has had an impact on cities and has increasingly boosted the enthusiasm of merchants. This general impression is the result of a combination of various reasons: One, because everyone knows that Britain's national strength is strengthening day by day; one, because everyone knows that we are prepared to shoulder any burden necessary to ensure our safety; one, because of the close and warm understanding between Britain and France; one, because of the good relations between Britain and the United States; one, because the Spanish war is expected to end soon and not extend beyond the borders of Spain. And the main reason for this trust is the Prime Minister Chamberlain's determination to promote an understanding of mutual sourness with various countries, regardless of what kind of political system they belong to, and the calmness and determination of the Prime Minister in holding his course during the recent days of worry and danger." (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Prime Minister Chamberlain had dinner at the German Embassy last night at the invitation of German Ambassador Dirksen, with Italian Ambassador Grandi also in attendance. Those in charge here are concerned about whether they discussed the European appeasement question and believe that Prime Minister Chamberlain, who has just announced Britain's massive arms expansion program, is best qualified to pursue an appeasement policy without sacrificing the common interests of Britain and France. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

(London) The Italian semi-official "Foreign Communications Report" recently published an article stating that Italian volunteers within Spain must wait until General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish National Army, issues a statement saying that their mission has been completed before they are withdrawn to their home country. Those in charge here have commented that although the tone of this article is quite arrogant, it is not without its satisfactory aspects. The British side was originally afraid that the German and Italian volunteers would refuse to withdraw from Spain. Now, given the article in the "Foreign Communications Report," it is known that the timing of the withdrawal of the Italian volunteers can be decided by General Franco, which can be regarded as fortunate. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

(Rome) British newspapers have commented on the increase in the number of troops stationed in Italian territory in North Africa, Libya. Those in charge here explained that when the Anglo-Italian Agreement was concluded on April 16 of last year, Italy agreed not to increase the number of troops stationed in the Libyan colony, but this restriction was conditional on maintaining the original number of troops stationed in French Tunisia and Algeria. Now that the French troops have increased, Italy is no longer subject to any restrictions. The People's Daily reported, "No matter how the existing agreements stipulate, since France has increased its troops in its territory, Italy will naturally follow suit, which is only natural. It would be absurd to say that Italy has agreed to place itself at a disadvantage to France. In short, Fascist Italy does not want to be restricted by itself, and this is what the British government should understand." (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### Britain to Send a Representative to Berlin

(London) Official sources here have recently announced that the Director of the Economic Division of the Foreign Office, Walter Kinton, may be traveling to Berlin in the near future. Walter Kinton has traveled to Germany many times, and this trip has no special significance. It is reported that Walter Kinton accompanied the former Minister of Commerce, Lord Runciman, the current Lord President of the Council, to Czechoslovakia in July of last year to assist in mediation work.

This trip is seen as further evidence of the close relationship between the British and French aircraft industries. The delegation may negotiate with France to obtain licenses to manufacture various British aircraft engines and accessories. The French aircraft industry representatives will formally visit British aircraft industry leaders within days. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

### The Spanish Situation Nearing a Consensus: Foreign Minister Flies from Paris to Madrid; British and French Indirect Negotiations Very Active

(Paris) Regarding the indirect negotiations to end the Spanish Civil War, apparently initiated by Spanish Prime Minister Azaña, these have begun here. Le Petit Parisien recently reported that a portion of the Spanish government is still hesitant, but those in favor of reconciliation seem to be gradually gaining the upper hand. (Reuter, 17th)

(Paris) Spanish Republican government Foreign Minister Del Vayo flew from Paris to Madrid last night. (Reuter, 17th)

(Paris) According to reports, Spanish Prime Minister Negrín sent a personal letter via Foreign Minister Vayo to President Azaña in Paris, urging him to return to Madrid as soon as possible. Negrín strongly argued for continuing the war to meet the needs of the international situation, stating that if the president remained away from the country for an extended period, difficulties would only increase. Azaña did not accept this request. (Haitong Telegram, 17th)

(Paris) Spanish Republican government Foreign Minister Del Vayo recently visited President Azaña here. According to sources from the Spanish Republican government, Foreign Minister Del Vayo came based on a cabinet decision to urge President Azaña to return to Madrid. President Azaña immediately refused again, stating to Foreign Minister Del Vayo that continuing the war would inevitably lead to failure, and he wished to restore peace as soon as possible. If he returned to the country at this time, it would appear to encourage the war, which was not appropriate. Recently, a certain important British figure had proposed peace terms to the Nationalist forces authorities, namely: (1) all foreign troops should withdraw from Spain; (2) the Nationalist forces should not retaliate against officers and soldiers of the government forces and officials; (3) the issue of the political system should be decided by the Spanish people themselves, free from any foreign influence. In the future, negotiations could be conducted either by the Madrid government or by General Miaja, commander of the government forces, with the Nationalist government. Sources from the Spanish Republican government also stated that whether the civil war could end depended on whether the Nationalist government accepted the above three conditions. If the Nationalist government did not reject them entirely, then peace was not hopeless. (Havas, 16th)

(London) The imminent end of the Spanish Civil War has been confirmed by well-informed sources here. It is expected that both sides will implement a ceasefire within the week. It is confirmed that this matter was initiated by the British government last night, conducting semi-official mediation. However, both sides must first agree to a ceasefire and promise not to open fire during negotiations. The matter is proceeding on several fronts. In addition to instructing Sir Hoare, the British commercial representative in Spain, to explore the issue with the Nationalist government, the British government had previously had talks between Foreign Secretary Halifax and the Spanish Republican government's representative, and Sir Monsey, head of the Foreign Office's Spanish Department, with the Duke of Alba, the Nationalist government's representative in London. The Duke of Alba looked pleased when he left the Foreign Office, and it is generally believed that the talks went well. The main issue discussed was the amnesty for Republican government personnel. Regarding this matter, political figures here hope that General Franco, commander of the Nationalist forces, will adopt a conciliatory attitude. Once the British government reaches an agreement with the Nationalist government authorities, it is said that the British government will recognize the Nationalist government as the legitimate government. In addition to awaiting Sir Hoare's report on the outcome of the negotiations, Foreign Secretary Halifax will also hold talks with representatives of the various dominions to seek their opinions. (Havas, 17th)

(Paris) Regarding the British government's initiation of mediation with both sides of the Spanish Civil War through semi-official channels, well-informed sources here have recently stated that the French government fully supports this move. British Foreign Office officials held separate talks yesterday with the Spanish Republican government's representative and the Nationalist government's representative. At the same time, Sir Phipps, the British Ambassador to France, consulted with French Foreign Minister Bonnet. Ambassador Phipps is said to be serving as a liaison between the British government and key figures in the Spanish Republican government here. The British government's ceasefire plan has been telegraphed to its commercial representative in Spain, Sir Hoare, instructing him to explore opinions with the Nationalist government authorities. France hopes for the success of the British mediation, but is not as optimistic as the British side, because it is difficult to grasp General Franco's attitude on the issue of amnesty for Republican government personnel. Assuming General Franco agrees to an amnesty, then the Nationalist forces should abandon the idea of ​​occupying Madrid, and Madrid would therefore maintain its status as the capital. Responsible sources here also stated that the Spanish Civil War has now entered a decisive stage. French right-wing Senator Peyral has been sent to Burgos, Spain, to discuss Franco-French issues with the Nationalist government authorities. After these issues are resolved, France may recognize the Nationalist government as the legitimate government. It can be seen that Peyral's trip is unrelated to the British mediation of the Spanish Civil War, but Peyral's efforts in Burgos should be helpful to the British action, which is also the actual situation. In the event that the British-proposed ceasefire plan is fully accepted by the Nationalist government during Peyral's trip to Spain, or even before Peyral arrives in Spain, it is expected that the British government will immediately recognize the Nationalist government. If this is the case, then the French government will immediately follow suit and appoint Peyral as its ambassador to Spain. (Havas, 17th)

(Paris) The newspapers here today criticized the movement within Paris to end the Spanish Civil War. Le Petit Parisien reported that the reason the Spanish Republicans insisted on fighting to the end was that they believed the mission of the French special envoy Bérard would be frustrated, and that Britain and France would refuse to legally recognize the Nationalist government. Strangely, this hope coincided with the wishes of German and Italian volunteers, because in fact, the Italian authorities very much wanted the Spanish Civil War to be prolonged, so that their troops could always be in the Nationalist forces to prevent the Nationalist forces from declaring complete independence. (Reuter, 17th)

### Nationalist Artillery Bombs Madrid; Peru Recognizes Nationalist Government

Madrid: Today is still the third anniversary of the re-election of the Republican government's parliament. The Nationalist artillery forces have been fiercely bombarding the city since midnight yesterday, with booming sounds and deafening noise, only stopping at noon today. No fewer than 150 shells landed in the city. The parliament held its re-election on February 16, 1936, when the parties belonging to the Popular Front achieved a great victory. (Havas, 16th)

Burgos: According to well-informed sources here close to the Nationalist government, General Franco will soon lead his troops to resume large-scale military operations. During this ceasefire period, General Franco is actively preparing for war, regardless of international speculation as to whether the government forces will continue to resist or unconditionally surrender to the Nationalist forces. He has decided to end the Spanish Civil War with military action, regardless of the international situation and foreign political relations. Nationalist government officials have also repeatedly stated that Franco will temporarily disregard foreign political relations, and will only consider accommodating foreign political forces after the Spanish Civil War is completely over. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)

(Paris) According to the Paris Evening News, the British government recently proposed a ceasefire to Spanish Nationalist Foreign Minister Jordana through its representative in Burgos, Sir Hoare, including a referendum to decide the future Spanish constitution. This has been rejected by General Franco, who insists that the government forces surrender unconditionally. (Haitong Telegram, 17th)

Burgos: The government of Peru in South America has recently decided to recognize the Nationalist government as the legitimate government and intends to upgrade its embassy in Spain to an embassy. (Havas News Agency, 16th)

### Italy Explains its Attitude on Troop Withdrawal; Germany Expresses Welcome

(Rome) According to official diplomatic sources, Italian volunteers in Spain will be able to return to their country once General Franco notifies them that their mission has ended. The newspaper also discussed the situation regarding this matter, saying, "Responsible parties here have been absolutely calm after the various rumors of the so-called Great Democratic Powers recognizing the Nationalist government. The final decision of Britain and France to recognize the victors is only human nature, but the path they are taking shows their mental confusion and complete lack of understanding of the Spanish people's psychology. Responsible parties here are aware of General Franco's main policy and the iron necessity of this policy, because they have been following it since the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Italy first responded to General Franco's appeal on July 27, 1936, and Italian volunteers joined the war on that day. On November 18 of the same year, Italy and Germany jointly recognized the Franco government as the legitimate government of Spain. Recently, a certain British cabinet member ignored the unity of existing interests between Spain and Italy, the spiritual consistency of the two countries, and the fair, noble, and chivalrous spirit of the Spanish people, and issued a defense that lacked any sentiment, believing that the volunteer soldiers of Italy who fought in the land and air battlefields of Spain could be disbanded. As for the Italian volunteers (i.e., the brave fighters who have long been regarded as a nightmare by the Great Democratic Powers), they will return to their country once General Franco notifies them that their responsibility has ended, but they will never withdraw before that. This is a characteristic of Fascist Italy cooperating with its friends to the end." (Reuter, 17th)

(Berlin) The local Berlin daily newspaper welcomed the news released by the Rome diplomatic intelligence office that the period of stationing of Italian volunteer troops in Spain will be transferred according to General Franco's will. The newspaper mentioned the tragic and farcical events between Spanish President Azaña and Paris, saying that the British and French governments are now awaiting the results of this. It continued, "We have said it long ago, this is to prolong the Spanish war. If the democratic countries continue to directly or diplomatically support the Red Army, then Italy should take action to avoid weakening the victory of the good cause. London and Paris should not be surprised by this." (Reuter, 17th)

### Mrs. Roosevelt's Speech Opposes Isolationism

Mrs. Roosevelt recently gave a speech to the students of the College of Agriculture at Cornell University in this city, expressing her opposition to isolationism. Her book says, "Hoping to satisfy all countries is difficult. Even if you give them something today, they will still provoke other countries in the future. It can be asserted that what the United States should do when war breaks out in the future is what we should plan for. We must know that whether to go to war is not something we can decide, but we must try our best to cooperate with other countries to deal with it in order to solve it. Otherwise, the world will fall apart, and the end of human civilization may be in the next generation." (Havas, 16th)

### The Only Catholic Church in Moscow Holds a Memorial Mass for the Late Pope

(Moscow) St. Louis Church, the only Catholic church in Moscow, held a memorial prayer service for the late Pope today, presided over by American priest Blanc. Members of the diplomatic corps attended in full dress. In addition, there were hundreds of Russians, mostly women. Soviet newspapers did not criticize the death of the late Pope, but anti-religious newspapers criticized the late Pope for opposing communism. (Reuter, 17th)

### Declarations by Britain, France, etc. that the Principle of Arbitration is Not Applicable in Wartime; Unwilling to be Bound by Changes in the European Situation; but Will Continue to Abide by it in Peacetime

(London) Britain, France, New Zealand, and India have all notified the League of Nations Secretariat that they will not be bound by the agreement on reconciliation, arbitration, and resolution of various disputes drawn up in Geneva on September 26, 1928, in wartime, but will continue to abide by it in peacetime. According to the White Paper, the main reason for the British government's decision is that the League of Nations and its member states have changed their covenant obligations. However, the British government is prepared to consider any amendments that may be generally agreed upon to make the agreement suitable for the current situation. Well-informed sources in London do not attach too much importance to this decision, believing that war is not likely to break out immediately. The British government's action is merely unwilling to be bound by any restrictions that are not compatible with the changed environment in Europe. And one thing to note is that the aforementioned agreement has never been implemented. (Reuter, 17th)

### France's Purchase of Aircraft from the United States Causes Another Repercussion; the Netherlands and Australia Also Purchase Aircraft from the United States

(Washington) The rumor that President Roosevelt disregarded the opposition of the army and allowed the French Air Force inspection team to inspect the latest American bombers has once again caused debate in Congress. This development is due to a senator claiming that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau confirmed the above rumor in today's meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee. According to Senator Austin, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said when making the above confirmation that what the president disregarded was specifically the opposition of the Chief of Staff of the US Army, General Craig, to the French inspection team purchasing the latest American bombers. Austin also said that the army personnel opposed it because France's purchase of American aircraft would hinder the US government's own plans and would deprive the army of the right to use the latest aircraft one year earlier than others. As for the type of aircraft involved, it is the Douglas light bomber, which is currently being tested in order to compete for the US Army's order. Austin finally said that according to the Senate Armed Services Committee, France has recently ordered 100 of these aircraft. (Reuter, 17th)

(Washington) According to reliable sources today, President Roosevelt personally instructed the Treasury Secretary to provide as much assistance as possible to the French military inspection team's purchase of aircraft from the United States. The number of the latest fighter jets that France is allowed to purchase could reach as many as 1,500. This secret was revealed by Republican Senator Austin. There are also clues in Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's report to the Senate Armed Services Committee on January 27, because Morgenthau believes that this matter is due to the president's request, not his own initiative. It is said that US Chief of Staff General Clark opposed this move. (AP, 16th)

(New York) The New York People's Tribune recently published a telegram from a Washington correspondent stating that the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dutch East Indies have purchased aircraft from the United States to strengthen their defenses in view of Japan's expanding power on the Asian continent. The Commonwealth Government of Australia ordered 50 military aircraft from Lockheed Aircraft in the United States in December last year, agreeing to deliver them this year, worth US$5,000,000. The Dutch East Indies also signed a contract with the factory to purchase 12 aircraft, worth US$700,000, to be completed around March 8 and conduct test flights. (Havas, 16th)

### Japan Scrapes Together Resources; Expands Issuing Banks; and Will Discuss Increasing Taxes

(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance will submit to the parliament a bill to increase taxes by 195 million yuan and a bill to reduce taxes on expanding productivity as part of the financial resources for temporary military expenses. It has been in close contact with legal authorities recently, and it was only completed on the night of the 16th. It will be officially decided by the cabinet on the 17th, and then submitted to the emperor for approval. It will be submitted to the Diet on the 18th and deliberated at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 21st. (17th Telegraph)

(Tokyo) In order to scrape together war funds and inflate currency, the Japanese authorities are trying their best to expand the three major issuing banks. At the Ministry of Finance's advisory meeting on the 15th evening, it was decided that the expansion amount of the guaranteed reserves of the three banks would be as follows: Bank of Japan 500 million yuan, Bank of Korea 60 million yuan, Bank of Taiwan 30 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance will submit to the parliament a bill regarding the expansion of the guaranteed reserves of the three banks. After this expansion, the guaranteed reserves of the three banks have increased to the following limits: Bank of Japan 2.1 billion yuan, Bank of Korea 160 million yuan, Bank of Taiwan 80 million yuan. (17th Telegraph)

Tokyo: The Japanese government decided in the cabinet meeting on the 16th on the second additional proposal for the general accounting revenue and expenditure budget for Showa 13 and the first additional proposal for the budget for each special accounting.

### Unrest in Burma; Government Resigns

Rangoon: The Burmese government submitted its resignation yesterday because of the prolonged riots and disturbances throughout the territory. Governor Cochrane immediately formed a new government. Yesterday, the opposition party in the lower house criticized the government for "failing to maintain law and order." A commission of inquiry recently issued a report saying that these disturbances were caused by unsatisfactory land lease conditions and their impact on Indian immigrants, the marriage of Burmese women to foreigners, especially Indians, the attitude of the newspapers, and other influences. (Reuter, 17th)

Rangoon: The Burmese Upper House passed a vote of no confidence in the government with 20 votes against 1 the day before yesterday. The Lower House also passed a vote of no confidence with 70 votes against 37 yesterday. The government suffered a majority opposition from both houses, which is the result of its social policies failing to satisfy the people. People generally accused the government of not taking active measures to improve the situation of workers and prevent opportunists from inciting strikes. Now that the government has lost the confidence of both houses, the cabinet should submit its resignation. However, all parties are worried, believing that changing policies under the current situation may increase strikes or lead workers to make excessive demands. (Haitong Telegram, 17th)

Rangoon: This morning, there were demonstrations again in the streets of Rangoon. Buses and trams were attacked by stones and bottles, and overturned on the ground by strikers, causing all traffic in the city to come to a complete standstill. (17th Haitong)

### Japan-Russia Fisheries Negotiations; Stalemate Turns Tense Again; Japan Advocates Maintaining the Status Quo; and Threatens with Free Fishing

(Tokyo) The newspapers here are paying close attention to the tense situation caused by the stalemate in the Japan-Soviet fisheries negotiations. The Asahi Shimbun said that the outcome of the future meeting between Japanese Ambassador to Russia Togo and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov is very important. If the Soviet Union refuses to reconsider its attitude, it is believed that the Japanese government will issue a statement stating that Japan has no other feasible way but to freely fish to protect its treaty rights. At the same time, Japanese fishermen are making necessary arrangements. If the Soviet Union does not have a sincere attitude and the dispute cannot be resolved, they will begin fishing in the Soviet North Pacific territorial waters regardless of any obstacles. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, the Japanese government has sent the most important final instruction to the Japanese ambassador, expressing Japan's determination to protect its fishing rights in the North Pacific, which it obtained with blood. (Reuter, 17th)

(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun reported that Japanese Ambassador to Russia Togo Taketora received instructions from Foreign Minister Arita yesterday, urging the Soviet government to reopen fisheries negotiations. He will present Japan's attitude to Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov today, roughly making Litvinov aware that if the Soviet Union does not reconsider its attitude, Japan will have no choice but to "freely fish" in order to protect its treaty rights. The newspaper also said that the only way to save the situation is for Japan and the Soviet Union to conclude a temporary treaty based on maintaining the status quo, pending the continued negotiation of a formal treaty. The Japanese ambassador will also tell Litvinov that if Japan is forced to "freely fish," the Soviet Union should be responsible for all possible disputes and their consequences. (Reuter, 17th)

(New York) The New York People's Tribune commented on Japan's military strategy in Asia, saying that Japan is about to shift its focus from central China to eastern Siberia. Because Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, with the help of German leader Hitler, has created a situation in the Mediterranean after making territorial demands on France, causing Western European countries to be unable to take care of the Far East. Japan believes that there is an opportunity to take advantage of this. After a year, it does not have to do so. On the other hand, the Japanese military authorities deeply believe that the Soviet Union's purges have weakened the Red Army, which is also a good opportunity to deal with the country. However, the Japanese army has been engaged in an inglorious war in China for 18 months, and it is also aware of its weaknesses. Therefore, it does not dare to attack the Russian polar bear even from behind. It must wait for someone to attack it from the front before it can take advantage of the situation. This is why it is colluding with Germany and Italy. (Havas, 16th)

(Berlin) Japanese figures here recently stated that Frankfurt and Munich will hold a conference of the Anti-Comintern Movement in a short period of time. Japanese Ambassador General Oshima and German cabinet member Hess will give speeches at that time. Envoys from other signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact, namely Italy and Hungary, may also attend and give speeches. Ambassador Oshima is scheduled to travel to Frankfurt on the 13th of next month, and the Anti-Comintern Movement Conference may begin the next day. (17th Havas)

(Paris) Le Petit Parisien recently published a telegram from a correspondent stationed in New York, whose content commented on the attitude of the United States towards the international situation, saying, "The current problem is not limited to Europe alone, but is intertwined with the Asian problem. Therefore, the United States has to pay attention to the international situation. The United States does not want Japan's power to expand greatly in the Far East, and at the same time, it is well aware that the totalitarian countries have put great pressure on the Japanese government, forcing it to get involved in the total vortex of turmoil. If Germany, Italy, and Japan take joint action in the future, then war will inevitably follow. At that time, Japan will inevitably become an important factor, because since the British Navy has something to do in Europe, if Japan attacks Singapore and other British territories in the Far East, then British power will inevitably be further weakened. However, if the United States joins the war, then Japan, knowing that it cannot defeat the navies of Britain and the United States, may retreat in the face of difficulties. It is also possible to avoid getting involved in the vortex. The United States' active strengthening of military preparations and President Roosevelt's adoption of a firm attitude are necessary for the benefit of the United States itself. It is hoped that its influence will also be a major factor in the international decision on war and peace." (Havas, 17th)

### War Between England and [Germany]: Ireland's Difficulty in Remaining Neutral

Dublin: At today's South Irish Parliament session, during the discussion on increasing the 1939-40 army budget, Prime Minister de Valera declared that if England engages in war, Ireland cannot wishfully maintain neutrality. Any country at war with England would inevitably attempt to bomb Irish ports to prevent food shipments to England. The army budget totals £3,252,195, an increase of £256,515 compared to 1938-39, mainly due to preparations for purchasing military supplies. (Reuters, 16th)

Dublin: The South Irish Parliament, by a vote of 62 to 39, approved the allocation of £5.5 million as soon as possible to strengthen military preparedness, with an annual expenditure of £2.5 million to maintain a national defense policy with 30,000 soldiers. According to Defense Minister Aganpon, the government's primary challenge is maintaining neutrality during wartime, followed by preventing enemy forces from attacking England via Ireland. (Reuters, 17th)

Palestine Issue: Britain Proposes Compromise

(London) The Jewish delegation at the Palestine problem conference held talks with Colonial Secretary MacDonald and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler this morning for approximately two hours. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax was also present at the beginning of the talks before leaving. The discussions were based on British authorities' proposals regarding restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine and Jewish residents' acquisition of land there, as well as the Jewish delegation's submitted opinions. Well-informed sources here recently stated that the British side is now advocating a compromise solution, the key point of which is to establish a parliament composed of elected representatives from the Palestinian Arab, Jewish, and British resident communities to jointly preside over legislative matters. This would also limit the number of Jewish immigrants to Palestine and the amount of land Jews can purchase there. Neighboring Arab countries, especially Transjordan and Iraq, would accommodate Jewish immigrants, dispersing Jewish residents among Arab countries and providing a remedy for the restrictions they face in Palestine. However, this compromise solution also has its difficulties, namely that the Jewish advocacy for establishing a place for their people to live and thrive in Palestine and the Arab advocacy for establishing an independent nation there both fail to be fully realized within this compromise solution. It is hoped that moderate Jews may accept it, but only on the condition that Arabs make similar concessions. The Jewish delegation's request to hold a roundtable conference with the Arab delegation and the British government delegation is also aimed at adjusting the concessions made by both Arabs and Jews. (Havas, 17th)

### Southern Country Premier Announces Policy: To Recognize Croatian Autonomy

Yugoslav Capital: The newly appointed Prime Minister of the Cabinet, Zhitko Vic, recently read his policy declaration at the House of Representatives this afternoon, stating briefly that the new cabinet will continue to strive for peace in accordance with the policies established by the previous cabinet. In terms of diplomacy, we will maintain friendly and close relations with all neighboring countries and major powers. "What we should strive for in the future is to maintain existing friendships and promote them." In terms of domestic affairs, we will resolve the issue of Croatian "compatriot" autonomy based on the principle of equality and in a fair manner. Relevant authorities commented that this is the first time that successive cabinets have clearly mentioned the Croatian issue in their policy declarations, demonstrating the government's adoption of popular opinion. (Havas, 16th)

### Hungarian Cabinet Formed: No Major Policy Changes

Hungarian Capital: Former Minister of Education Deleki was instructed by Regent Horthy to attempt to form a new cabinet. He initially declined due to numerous difficulties, but after repeated urging from General Horthy, he reluctantly agreed. The new cabinet has now been formed, with the following personnel:

Prime Minister: Deleki

Foreign Minister: Chaki (reappointed)

Interior Minister: Fisi (reappointed)

Defense Minister: General Bartai (reappointed)

Finance Minister: Schiller (reappointed)

Justice Minister: Nazi (new appointment)

Agriculture Minister: Michael Deleki (reappointed)

Minister of Commerce and Industry: Gonde (reappointed)

Minister of Education: Homan (new appointment)

After the formation of the new cabinet, Prime Minister Deleki immediately gave a statement to the newspapers, saying, "The foreign policy will remain unchanged, and domestic policy will maintain all anti-Jewish laws." Political figures commented that this cabinet reshuffle is of great importance, and Regent Horthy's determination to prevent Hungary from leaning towards totalitarianism is evident in this. However, the policies pursued by Hungary since last year have been influenced by Germany and Italy, and it is not possible to change course overnight. If Hungary wants to break away from the influence of Germany and Italy and move closer to the small countries of Central and Southern Europe, foreign countries must immediately provide strong support, and countries with special relationships should make sacrifices. In short, time is pressing, and action must be taken as soon as possible. (Havas, 16th)

### Government Improves Wartime Industry

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese newspapers, the Chinese government is sparing no effort in promoting general industrial construction during the war of resistance. In addition to major industries such as silk, chemicals, hydropower, and textiles, the government believes that Chinese rural handicrafts have unique strengths. If they can be guided and improved, it is necessary to increase production to supplement the shortcomings of mechanical industry. The government has now decided to adopt the following guidelines to actively promote rural handicrafts: (1) Actively improve techniques to increase production and meet the needs of rural areas during the war of resistance. (2) Establish small iron and wood factories in various county towns to supply various production tools. (3) The Agricultural Credit Administration will provide loans to promote the development of rural handicrafts. (4) Guide the organization of rural handicraft cooperatives to investigate production and sales. (5) Rural handicrafts are simple to produce, and the government will mobilize a large number of rural women to participate in production to strengthen the economic foundation of the war of resistance and national construction.

### Authorities Concerned About Chongqing's Safety

(Chongqing) Since the Japanese bombing of Chongqing on January 15th, the Chinese authorities have never slackened in evacuating refugees, strengthening defenses, and preparing for relief efforts. According to reliable sources, the highest Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about the safety of Chongqing and today specifically ordered all police and those engaged in relief work to intensify preparations to cope with the indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft. The authorities also ordered the continued evacuation of civilians. Chongqing currently has a population of about 400,000. Today, the authorities ordered the allocation of one million yuan for relief and evacuation of refugees. Evacuees mostly take the Chongqing-Chengdu Highway, the Chongqing-Guiyang Highway, and the areas along the river. The Chongqing Garrison Headquarters is currently transporting three large fire engines here from a certain place downstream. The authorities are also demolishing old houses to reduce the risk of fire spreading and plan to build two pontoon bridges on the Yangtze River and Jialing River to facilitate escape during air raids.

### The Details of the Recent European Situation (European Correspondence)

— Shu Di

Where Will the Aggressor Group Start?

In the past two days, because the Spanish rebels have captured Barcelona, the situation of the Spanish Civil War is absolutely advantageous to the rebels. Therefore, the hearts of the people in Europe are uneasy again. Taking Britain as an example, in the past, most people only felt sympathy for the war in Spain, but that sympathy did not seem to be closely related to them. Now, suddenly, the shadow of war is pressing on their heads, and everyone immediately feels the seriousness of the situation, confirming that the war in Spain is actually being fought for them. Therefore, in the past few days, propaganda calling for aid to the Spanish government has been found almost everywhere. Demonstrations and mass gatherings, like a wildfire, have spread throughout the British Isles. - However, this is only in general terms.

Those who know a little more about the inside story have long known that the international crisis has been serious for more than a month; at that time, Germany's financial and military negotiations with Britain had successively failed, and France had formally notified Britain that it did not need to act as a mediator due to Italy's demand for territory, and that France was prepared to fight Italy if necessary. However, even so, the only key to its ability to be delayed until today without bursting is indeed the war in Spain. According to the original plan agreed upon by Germany and Italy, they were prepared to completely lay the foundation for the war in Spain before the Rome talks between Britain and Italy, threatening France's southern border; in conjunction with this, Germany concentrated its large army to press on France's northern border, restraining France's so-called "Maginot Line" military force; then, as the most powerful force to threaten France and constantly taking an offensive posture, the huge number of troops were still concentrated in Austria and northern Italy. According to general estimates, the number of German troops recently concentrated in Austria alone is more than one army corps. In this way, Germany and Italy planned that during the Rome talks, they could make any demands on Britain and France and have a "Munich II." Therefore, on the eve of the talks, Hitler had originally decided to send German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Rome during the talks to promote everything. However, this plan was not realized, and the main reason was that the Spanish rebels failed to capture Barcelona within the predetermined time according to Mussolini's plan.

Now, Barcelona has been captured by the rebels with German and Italian ordnance technicians and Italian regular troops. Therefore, Germany and Italy believe that the victory of the Spanish rebels is probably no longer a problem, and in the near future, they will implement their original plan. In these last five minutes, if Britain and France want to save the crisis, in fact, the only viable way for them at this point is to step up aid to the Spanish Republican government and turn the tide of the war. However, judging from the progress of the past two days, the future is very bleak. The Spanish Republican government representative Devayu's repeated appeals for aid to the French government have been rejected by the French government. The remaining hope is that the Soviet Union will obtain French cooperation and take action to save this imminent international crisis. However, from the Soviet Union's own standpoint, this is the least wise move. In my personal opinion, in order to take into account the entire situation of international politics and at the same time take into account its own position, the Soviet Union can only maintain the old attitude of last year's Czech problem, endure the pain, and insist that France take action as a major prerequisite for its own actions. Therefore, the arrival of a major international crisis is probably destined.

Covering the hearts of people all over the world, the biggest question at present is: Where will Germany and Italy make their next move?

Judging from the current evolution of the situation, the future outbreak of a major international crisis will be one of the following three ways.

(1) Simply make demands to Britain and France to limit arms expansion and demand loans. This point, with the dismissal of Dr. Schacht last week, is a major key in the development of the situation. However, the British reaction after Schacht's dismissal was beyond Hitler's expectations: instead of quickly trying to please Germany and allow various financial concessions, it was: (1) a sharp drop in the price of German bonds on the London market, (2) the expansion of armaments, and the training of the public for war, accelerated even further than before. (3) The views of hardliners in the current British cabinet suddenly rose to prominence. Even Foreign Secretary Halifax, who has always been known for being pro-German, is among them. Their current view is that Hitler and Mussolini definitely do not intend to go to war with Britain and France immediately; therefore, for the intimidation that is about to come, (they are asking Prime Minister Chamberlain) it is best to deal with it strongly. Especially in terms of wording, they believe that Chamberlain's words are a little too weak, and at the very least, they should be as firm as Roosevelt and Daladier in order to eradicate the extortion mentality of the aggressor countries.

The financial and economic negotiations between Britain and Germany, which have already stalled, have recently more firmly closed the door to reopening. Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, has now quietly returned to London.

(2) Germany frankly annexes the small countries of Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Recent developments have confirmed that the progress of this route is accelerating; however, the possibility of this causing an international crisis can be said to have almost disappeared. Not long ago, there was a question here that caused great concern in all aspects, that is: what would be the attitude of Britain and France if Germany annexed the countries of Eastern and Southeastern Europe (especially Romania, which has the deepest relationship with Britain and France)? Later, everyone gradually learned that the British and French authorities had long had a tacit understanding: if Germany did so, they would also decide not to interfere and would still bury their heads in expanding their armies. Therefore, there is actually no obstacle to Germany and Italy's development in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, without the need for fanfare. The most important developments recently are: first, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Poland, and second, Italian Foreign Minister Chiazzhu's visit to Yugoslavia. Their common goal, most importantly, is to determine the common attitude of these small countries in the event of disputes in Western Europe; especially for Poland, because it is located between Russia and Germany, Germany hopes even more that it can stand on the side of Germany and Italy in the event of disputes in Western Europe, so that Germany and Italy can avoid worrying about the power of Soviet Russia. As a condition for this move, Poland was offered a share when the colonial question of Britain and France was raised.

However, recent developments seem to have added another possible victim to the international crisis that Germany and Italy are about to create. This is the Dutch Far East colony, the Dutch East Indies. However, this is not the main item in the next crisis, but only a possible incidental product. Because raising the issue of dividing the East Indies in the international crisis after Japan's participation is really the most powerful move to threaten Britain and France and expand the power of the aggressor group of countries. According to recent news obtained here, if this question is raised, then Japan's first move will be to occupy several islands in the South Pacific first.

(3) However, the most pressing issue at present is the relationship between France and Italy. Italy's territorial demands on France have been officially put forward. Recently, we learned that as a result of recent consultations between Germany and Italy, Germany has promised to fully support Italy's territorial demands; however, as a condition for this "support attitude", Italy promised that, at present, it only needs to achieve (1) recognition of "Italian influence" in Tunisia, (2) "neutralization" of Corsica, and (3) sharing of the management rights of the Suez Canal. However, even if these three points are met, it is very questionable whether France can accept them, according to the current situation.

What will happen to Franco-Italian relations if the Spanish rebels are completely victorious? This is another shadow over the future relationship between France and Italy. According to the predetermined plan of Germany and Italy, as soon as the rebels are completely victorious, the first thing they will do is to pull her into the so-called "Anti-Communist Pact", second, Italian troops will be stationed on the border between France and Spain, and third, they will establish submarine and air force bases in Spanish ports to monopolize the Mediterranean Sea and cut off the maritime communications of the British and French empires. The target of this poisonous conspiracy - Britain and France - is now trapped in an abyss of panic. The most important countermeasure currently being considered is to try to win over the leader of the Western rebels, Franco, to make him break away from the Italian forces. If this move fails, then France intends to occupy several small islands in the Mediterranean Sea belonging to Spain with the support of Britain. But as far as we know so far, Britain has not yet clearly expressed its opinion on this proposal from France. - Perhaps they think it's too dangerous.

In what way will the current inevitable crisis be resolved? This will be revealed in the not-too-distant future.

### From the Saying "Don't Air Dirty Laundry" to the Necessity of Men's Health After Marriage

Cherish yourself, whether or not a man is healthy after marriage is not just a personal problem.

If there is illness, you should consider your beloved wife and quickly seek the most effective and targeted treatment.

Recently, in newspapers, magazines, and conversations over tea and wine, one often hears or sees: Mrs. So-and-so and Mr. So-and-so had a secret rendezvous at a certain hotel and were charged and punished; Mrs. So-and-so and her husband are in a divorce lawsuit, requesting alimony; Mr. So-and-so has set up a mistress, Mr. So-and-so plans to take a concubine, etc. It's truly dazzling, and these are just a few examples. However, the Chinese often have an old saying: "Don't air dirty laundry." From this, we can infer that the family scandals in ordinary families, strictly kept secret and not publicized, are probably even more numerous. Logically, the union of husband and wife should be based on love. With love, what cannot be openly and honestly shared? You are me, and I am you. Husband and wife are one, working together with one heart to create a bright and happy life. Why would there be any need for scandalous family affairs? However, if a man suffers from congenital weakness, early self-abuse and nocturnal emissions, or post-marital debauchery, excessive indulgence in sex, or overwork and exhaustion, resulting in a loss of vital energy, depletion of essence and blood, followed by spermatorrhea, dissipation of energy, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, and other symptoms, thus weakening his inherent functions or even losing them completely, how can his beautiful wife, wasting her youth, not feel grief and indignation? If this sacrifice continues for a long time, it would be difficult for even the most humane person to bear! Therefore, various scandals inevitably occur. These scandals spread and grow in the darkness, damaging the husband's reputation and destroying his life. From the man's perspective, how ugly and painful this is! The only remedy, according to world-renowned doctors and my own years of experience, is the universally recognized administration of the gonad extract preparation "Shengzhi Su" [Vitality Essence], which is most effective and targeted. This agent, based on factual needs, was developed by many European and American physiologists and pharmaceutical experts, such as Stenah, through years of arduous experiments, extracting gonad extract from animals such as apes and chimpanzees to supplement the human body, achieving the effects of reversing illness, prolonging life, and rejuvenating youth, thus shocking the medical world. However, the method of use was not very simple and could not be popularized. Therefore, it was further improved by Dintaras, and I happened to be studying medicine in the United States at the time. As a result, the gonad extract of powerful animals was made into a preparation named Stenah's "Shengzhi Su." Indeed, this agent can produce sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves within one day and night of taking it. If taken continuously, it will surely completely cure the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time and further improve health. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Ximitu's Gujing Pian" [Semen-Consolidating Tablets] to strengthen the seminal vesicle and stop leakage, so that both the root and symptoms are treated, and the effect is even faster! Furthermore, if patients can personally come to this clinic to be diagnosed by expert doctors, and receive the latest treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.

Common Youth Ailments

### What are the Causes of Spermatorrhea?

— Sex Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

In today's extremely licentious society, there are so many young people suffering from spermatorrhea that it is impossible to count them. Although they are desperately seeking treatment methods, most of them are still not very clear about the causes of the disease, so they often go astray in treatment.

The main causes of spermatorrhea can be roughly divided into three types: First, it belongs to men with good development and strong bodies. Due to the excessive accumulation of semen produced physiologically in the seminal vesicles, it causes local congestion and leads to spermatorrhea; second, weakness after illness, mental anxiety, involvement in entertainment venues, indulgence in sensual pleasures are all sufficient to induce dreams and affect the sexual nerves, so that the reproductive organs become erect unconsciously, and by the time they are awakened, it has become nocturnal emission; third, due to the stimulation of hormones in the body during the youth development period, or the enjoyment of reading erotic novels, scandalous historical anecdotes, and obscene pictures, which arouse the fire of desire and cannot be restrained. They secretly commit the bad habit of self-abuse (many patients simply only know the pleasure and do not know the harm). As a result, the youth gland is exhausted, and the sphincter of the seminal vesicle loses its control, and spermatorrhea erupts.

The causes of spermatorrhea have been roughly described above. Except for the first item, which belongs to physiological sperm overflow and does not need to be treated, and will return to normal upon marriage, the second and third types belong to pathological spermatorrhea and absolutely cannot be ignored. The third type especially needs attention, because in addition to the general symptoms of dizziness, blurred vision, lower back pain, weak memory, insomnia, night sweats, etc., the third type of spermatorrhea easily affects local development and results in the lifelong misfortune of being short like a child.

As for the most effective methods of saving this disease, for those who self-abuse, the first thing to do is to quit the bad habit. For those with milder symptoms, washing the local area with cold water before going to bed, not drinking alcohol or smoking, strictly adhering to health preservation, and taking four tablets of "Ximitu's Gujing Pian" can completely cure the condition. For those with worsening symptoms, in addition to the above-mentioned treatment methods, they can go to this clinic for "Diemen's" electrotherapy and prostate massage. If there are various symptoms of weakness due to prolonged leakage, they should also take the gonad extract preparation "Shengzhi Su" to produce sperm, strengthen the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and activate blood circulation. No matter how weak the body is, it can be restored to health in a short period of time.

### Breasts are the Key to Women's Health and Beauty

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

... and also the only way to a happy future.

If a woman's breasts can develop well, with two peaks standing side by side in front of her chest, and matched with a slender body and developed buttocks, the so-called most mysterious and precious curved beauty of a woman is completely revealed. This is so helpful for enhancing women's health and beauty. Such a healthy and beautiful woman must be broad-minded and healthy, with a happy expression on her face, and act in a lively state. Because her body and mind are sound and her emotions are rich, the love between husband and wife after marriage must also be very strong, and she will give birth to clever children and form a happy family. Not only does she feel satisfied herself, but she is also often praised and envied by others! Isn't this the happiest woman in the world? If a woman suffers from congenital weakness, or early self-abuse and post-illness imbalance, as well as various reasons such as being restricted by physical education and oppressed by the environment, leading to leucorrhea, irregular menstruation, anemia, consumption, and other symptoms, and her ovarian function is damaged, her breasts will not develop well. Even those who have good development will gradually wither away, so that they appear to have shrunken breasts and a thin face, and show signs of premature aging. Such women are often ill, unable to give birth, and must be disliked by men, even abandoned by their husbands. The tragedy of their future is unimaginable! But even if it is tragic, you must not be discouraged! In today's era of omnipotent science, there are methods that can be used to remedy the situation, that is, taking the ovarian preparation "Shengzhi Su" for women. After taking it, the ovarian function can be promoted within one day and night, and the above-mentioned various symptoms can be gradually reduced. If taken continuously, not only can it cure diseases, making the breasts gradually rise, but also promote metabolism, producing a large number of new cells in the skin, muscles, blood, and other parts, so that the skin is naturally white and tender, the muscles are naturally plump, and the blood is naturally full and bright red. Therefore, the face is radiant, and the body is healthy and beautiful. There is no need for cosmetics to be incomparably beautiful. Indeed, isn't taking "Shengzhi Su" for women the key to women's health, beauty, and happiness?

House calls only charge four jiao.

### Why Does White Turbidity Threaten Reproduction?

The white turbidity that threatens reproduction has now been resolved. All descendants of those with gonorrhea are overjoyed.

In general, people think that gonorrhea occurs in the urethra, so why does it have such a great impact on reproduction? Many think it is alarmist talk, but they are greatly mistaken. The elements of human reproduction must have the following conditions: (1) The organ that manufactures sperm. (2) The raw materials for nourishing sperm. If the organ that manufactures sperm is damaged, it loses its function of manufacturing sperm, so there is no way to manufacture sperm. A kind of sperm is like a tadpole, swimming in the prostatic fluid. This prostatic fluid is the material on which the sperm relies for life. The organ that manufactures sperm is the testicle. Among the complications of gonorrhea, orchitis and prostatitis are the most common. Prostatitis is even easier to occur than orchitis. These two symptoms each have their special effects. Prostatitis often becomes prostatic leakage due to lack of treatment. When straining during bowel movements, a white liquid escapes from the urethral opening, thus wasting prostatic fluid. As for the disease of orchitis, if it occurs on one side, there is still one side that can manufacture sperm. If both sides suffer from inflammation, reproduction must be declared hopeless. With my experience of more than ten years, I use German Hesi serum and Le's prostate massage method, using the right treatment for the right symptoms. Furthermore, I use German Filtrin diathermy to penetrate the lesion and kill the gonococcus, so that all reproductive functions that threaten reproductive power are resolved. I can confidently and dare to guarantee this.

### Chinese Air Force Activities in Guangdong Threaten the Japanese Army, Two New Air Force Squadrons Have Already Arrived in Guangdong, Japanese Patrol Ship Sunk off Weizhou Island

Hong Kong dispatch: The Japanese army has been invading Guangdong for several months. The highest Chinese military authorities have long been preparing for a major counter-offensive. Recently, in order to cooperate with the powerful air force to assist the army in combat, and to achieve rapid results, they have specially dispatched two newly trained air force squadrons to the south, assigned to the command and control of the Fourth War Zone Commander, specifically responsible for consolidating air defense and bombing Japanese troops occupying various routes and strongholds, as well as various Japanese ships along the coast. The equipment of these two air force squadrons includes various Fokker fighter planes, Arado light bombers, four-engine Boeing B-299 heavy bombers, and reconnaissance planes. Their combat power and speed are exceptionally strong and are truly elite. Since arriving in Guangdong, they have been actively operating in Guangzhou, Shilong, Weizhou Island, Dongguan, Shunde, Xijiang, and other places, posing a major threat to the Japanese army. The following are records of their recent active achievements: On the afternoon of the 29th of last month, at around 2:00 PM, when the Chinese army and the Japanese army were engaged in a fierce battle in Sanshui, Xijiang, a squadron of twelve Shenying (Divine Eagle) team planes of the Chinese Air Force was also ordered to take off from a certain place to assist in the battle and sweep the Japanese army's motorboats along the river in Sanshui. They dropped more than ten bombs in the Sisi Xianjiao Estuary area, sinking five or six Japanese motorboats and one wooden boat on the spot. Many places in the Japanese army's position were also destroyed by the bombing. After the squadron's mission was completed and they were about to return to a certain place, they suddenly encountered five Japanese planes coming. An engagement immediately occurred. The Shenying team used brand-new tactics to charge the Japanese planes left and right. After ten minutes of intense fighting, the Japanese planes, due to the disparity in numbers, dared not linger and quickly turned east and fled. The Shenying team did not pursue them. Also, at 8:00 AM on the 1st of this month, six Japanese planes, divided into two groups, each in a "品" (character) formation, appeared over Rongqi Haiwei, which belongs to Shunde County. Upon hearing the news, the Shenying team of the Chinese Air Force immediately dispatched four planes to attack the Japanese planes. The Japanese planes then scattered to respond, and the situation was very fierce. The sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of firecrackers. The Shenying team launched a fierce attack on the Japanese planes with agile maneuvers. After about twenty minutes, the Japanese planes collapsed. Two of them were injured and swaying. The other four planes covered them as they fled west. According to the villagers in that area who watched the aerial combat, they witnessed one of the injured Japanese planes crash into the nearby sea, presumably due to the severity of the injuries. The team is tracking and searching for the location of the crashed Japanese plane in order to report it to the relevant authorities. Also, on the 9th of this month, more than forty Chinese Air Force planes flew to the outside of Beihai Port in two groups to bomb the Japanese ships in the sea there. The first time was at 7:00 AM that day, flying to Weizhou Island, and dropping more than twenty heavy bombs in a loop. Although the Japanese ships fired back at that time, the Chinese planes were not damaged. The second time was at around 9:00 AM that day, flying to Beihai to bomb the Japanese ships in the sea there. The Chinese planes bravely flew low in the dense circle of Japanese ship fire, dropping more than thirty bombs. They immediately sank a Japanese cruiser and damaged two Japanese gunboats before returning with the mission completed. Because the Chinese Air Force has been dispatched in all directions in the past ten days, showing great power, the Japanese ships in the Daya Bay sea have retreated one after another. At present, there are only one or two small ships anchored in places near Gangwan that are easy to hide, to prevent bombing and reconnaissance by the Chinese Air Force. At 3:00 PM on the 8th of this month, a giant ship and three destroyers suddenly sailed to the sea west of Sanmen Pass. According to fishermen from Sanmen Island, the giant ship was the command ship of Miyazaki, commander of the Southern Branch Dispatch Army, which the Japanese army used to land in Xayong last October. This decision to sail into Sanmen Pass was also to avoid bombing by the Chinese Air Force. From this, we can see the general threat that the Japanese army is facing from the Chinese Air Force.

### New Restrictions Imposed by the Japanese Army in Wuxi on the Hotel Industry: Travelers Must Have a Guarantor Before Being Allowed to Stay, Those Entering and Leaving the City Gate Must Be Searched Naked

Wuxi dispatch: Since the patriotic youth fought with the Japanese army and resisted arrest at the Oriental Garden Hotel in Tonghui Bridge a few days ago, in addition to the three youths who were captured on the spot due to running out of ammunition and escorted to the Japanese army headquarters, the Oriental Garden Hotel was sealed off by the Japanese army the next day and ceased operations. Unexpectedly, this case has not yet ended, and yesterday another incident occurred in which the owner of the Dafang Hotel, Mr. Gu, designed to tie up and kill Cui Bingsheng, the leader of the Japanese military police secret service team, which caused the Japanese army to pay special attention to the hotel industry. Currently, in addition to the Oriental and Dafang Hotels, several other hotels have also been sealed off. At the same time, the Japanese military police issued a notice to all hotels that any travelers staying, regardless of whether they have a pass from this city or other cities, must be guaranteed by a store registered in this county before they can stay. No guarantee is allowed. If it is found that someone is staying without a guarantee, in addition to the traveler, the hotel manager and waiters will be charged with concealing bandits. The above notice was issued at around 4:00 PM on the 14th. Because the matter was sudden, some travelers had nowhere to find a guarantor, so they wandered the streets all night, and it was extremely dangerous, because if they encountered Japanese soldiers on patrol, they would definitely be arrested and considered illegitimate. Since this notice was issued, all hotel operators have been complaining endlessly, because from now on, no one will visit. At the same time, the Japanese army requires people entering and leaving the city gates, regardless of age or gender, to undress and show their bodies. If there is any violation, they will be whipped by Japanese soldiers. I hope those who go to Wuxi will pay attention to the above situation.

### Frequent Mobilization of the Japanese Army in Yangzhou, Intended to Cover Up Weak Troops, Members of the Big Sword Society Arrested, Collection of Old Newspapers Leads to Death

Yangzhou dispatch: The Japanese soldiers occupying Yangzhou have been frequently mobilizing recently. In order to cover up their weak troops, they often claim that they will attack a certain place. This kind of ostrich-like trick has been detected by the Chinese military and civilians. The recent mobilization of the Japanese army has been very busy. The following is an exploration of its troop deployment: (1) The first battalion commander is Major Murata's unit, stationed in the city and county, and in the South Township Canal Qian, Yangzi Bridge, North Township Gongdao Bridge, Fangjia Lane, and West Township Yangjia Temple. (2) The second battalion commander is Major Kameban's unit, stationed in Xiannv Temple, Shaobei Liujia Village, Touerdao Bridge, Wanfu Bridge, and Huojia Bridge. (3) The third battalion commander is Major Suzuki's unit, stationed in Guazhou, Shierxu, Xinjie, Daxu, and other places. The cavalry captain is Captain Nara, and the artillery captain is Captain Watanabe. The two units are stationed in Tianchang County, and Nara is also the commander of the Yangzhou-Tianchang road garrison. The above units, totaling three battalions, and one directly subordinate cavalry and artillery team each, form a regiment, commanded by Ogawa, the commander of the Japanese army in Yangzhou, with a total of 1,500 people. In addition, there are about 500 puppet troops with extremely poor guns. Except for about 80 people stationed in the city, the rest cooperate with the Japanese army and are stationed in various important strongholds in the four townships. The Yangzhou Chinese guerrillas have a very large potential force lurking in the city. The puppet police have the possibility of defecting at any time. The Japanese army has become slightly aware of this, so it does not trust the puppet police very much, and even sometimes monitors and searches them. The Japanese army also feels that it cannot trust and use the Big Sword Society, so it once searched and arrested them some time ago, resulting in the Big Sword Society and the Japanese army turning against each other. The puppet pacification department, in order to cater to the Japanese army's intentions, arrested three members of the Big Sword Society, and sent them to the Japanese army headquarters for detention and interrogation. Guisaka, the commander of the Japanese army in Xiannv Temple, was wounded by the Chinese guerrillas, with one bullet in the head and one in the abdomen. The injuries were very serious. Although the doctor performed surgery, Guisaka was already in his fifties and had insufficient energy, and there was no hope of survival.

The Japanese army in Yangzhou often interrogates pedestrians, and many innocent people are arrested and sent to the military police team. Guo Xiangru, a resident of Guqiting in the city, was found to have a large number of Shenbao, Xinwenbao, and magazines from the 25th year of the Republic of China and was arrested and secretly executed. The puppet county office in Yangzhou is currently experiencing panic in finance and materials. Fang Xiaoting, the puppet magistrate, is very anxious and is currently consulting with all parties in an attempt to establish names and open up new sources of taxation in order to continue the fate of his puppet office and provide for the Japanese army's exploitation.

### Chao-Shan Industries are Flourishing, Export Value of Agricultural Products Has Increased Greatly, Imported Goods are Also Extremely Crowded

Shantou dispatch: Recently, various industries in Chao-Shan have shown a flourishing scene. Since January 25, the Japanese ships originally stationed in Shantou's overseas waters have all sailed to the south, and Japanese planes occasionally come to the coast for reconnaissance, but they have not dropped bombs, so people's hearts are greatly settled, and the market has gradually improved, and the population has also increased sharply. Since entering winter, hotels and inns have often been full. There are about 4,000 tourists staying in the city, most of whom are in Chao-Shan to purchase various goods. According to a household registration survey by the police station on January 31, there are 14 lodging residents returning to Shantou. There are 6,303 men with no occupation, 10,661 women, 8,523 men who do not engage in production, and 8,537 women. According to the police station's statistics, the number of residents in Chao-Shan is about 60,000 less than before the "July 7th" Incident, but the reduction is in women and children, with students and children accounting for the majority.

In front of the Shantou Customs, cargo ships are full of goods, all waiting for customs officers to inspect imports and exports. Many foreign ships used to stop at Hong Kong, Xiamen, and Haikou to load passengers and goods and travel south. Now they directly depart from Shantou fully loaded with passengers and goods, and no longer pick up passengers and goods along the way. The Pacific ship sailed from Shantou to Saigon the day before yesterday. All the available mandarin oranges in Chaozhou City were bought up. The price of oranges, which was 20 yuan per dan, suddenly soared to more than 40 yuan. It is estimated that the Pacific ship carried 4,000 barrels of mandarin oranges, and 10,000 dan of Chinese cabbage, mustard greens, kale sprouts, garlic, etc. According to the current value, the export value of mandarin oranges in previous years was 2 million Customs gold, and vegetables, etc. were 1.6 million yuan. This year, the price has increased more than doubled, and the exchange rate has risen. The export of agricultural products alone accounts for about 15 million yuan.

Secondly, there is congestion of imported goods, most of which belong to industrial raw materials, foreign yarn, dyes, cotton, light industrial products, food, etc., which are transferred from Shantou to the inland in large quantities. The Xingning native cloth industry has already sold out the native cloth to be woven next spring in various counties. According to Xingning merchants, half of the 500,000 residents of the county weave cloth, and men, women, old and young, all weave at home during their leisure time. Every day, more than 200 pieces of foreign yarn are sold (about 400 yuan per piece), and the county sells 40 to 50 million yuan of foreign yarn and 5 million yuan of dyes every year. In the past, black, blue, gray, and yellow native cloth was transported from Dongjiang to Guangzhou and Foshan, and shipped to Southeast Asia, or carried to Ganzhou and Shaoguan. This year, the Dongjiang river channel is blocked, and the sales of native cloth extend to Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces. The footsteps of porters reach as far as Xingning, which is the end of the line for inland cowhide, tobacco, paper, straw mushrooms, tung oil, medicinal materials, rosin, chicken feathers, etc. Xingning also demands Chao-Shan goods, and it has become a barter market. Salt, salted fish, and seafood from Haifeng, Lufeng, and Huilai counties are carried to Xingning. Chao-Shan brown sugar, fish, salt, groceries, matches, kerosene, cigarettes, and various daily necessities follow foreign yarn and dyes and enter various counties in large quantities. This new situation is caused by the blockage of the cargo transportation routes from Nanchang and Changsha. Chao-Shan has replaced Shanghai and Hong Kong, and Xingning has replaced Guangzhou. This is what the war has created.

### The Barrier of Western Fujian: Longyan - Cars Travel Through High Mountains as if Entering a Sea of Mist - The Air of Rural Reconstruction is Entirely New

Longyan Correspondence: People have always had a sense of mystery about Western Fujian, because it is too remote. To enter this land from the southeastern plains, one must cross many towering mountains. Even after entering Western Fujian, one is still surrounded by layers of peaks and valleys. With such a geographical environment, it is not easy to develop outward. People on the plains previously did not have enough resources to develop it, so it inevitably was "regarded as beyond the pale" and seen as a mysterious place. After the reporter inspected Western Fujian and visited Liancheng, the next morning he took a Longyan-Liancheng-Tingzhou company passenger car to continue to

Important Town in Western Fujian

Longyan. Currently, in Fujian Province, of all the road transportation businesses, only Longyan-Liancheng-Tingzhou and Zhangzhou-Longyan remain under commercial management. The rest have all been taken over by the Fujian Provincial Transportation Company. Commercial transportation suffers from insufficient vehicles and poor management. The vehicle the reporter took that day was actually a truck. The car body was narrow and there were many passengers. Hearing from fellow travelers, the transportation company has recently reached an agreement with the Longyan-Liancheng-Tingzhou section to jointly manage transportation, so the traffic on this road may gradually improve in the future. After the car left Liancheng, it traveled for about an hour before reaching Pengkou, which is an important transit station for Western Fujian's external transportation. Goods entering from the southeast to Zhangzhou, the southwest to Fengshi, and from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou in southern Fujian, as well as Chaozhou and Shantou in Guangdong Province, destined for Changting and other places in Western Fujian, must all be transferred here. After getting off the car, the reporter visited a tax office. According to them, the main goods transported inward are cotton cloth, salt, kerosene, matches, and tobacco, but they could not name one or two local products transported outward. The poverty of Western Fujian can be generally seen from this. The section of the road traveled in the morning was in a basin area, without mountains. Continuing from Pengkou, one gradually enters the Bopingling Mountains. The Bopingling Mountains run from the southeast of Changting to Longyan, forming a natural barrier in Western Fujian. Western Fujian,

Because of this Natural Fortress,

has achieved its current strategic importance. The car spiraled up a high ridge, and the windshield was covered with dense raindrops. One thought it was raining, but upon closer inspection, the ridge was filled with thick fog, and the mountain forest scenery beyond six meters had completely disappeared into the sea of fog. The water droplets on the windshield were condensed from the fog. When the car crossed the ridge and descended, the fog gradually dissipated, and a clear landscape reappeared before our eyes. After crossing several high mountains, one could sometimes see a few plains. As far as the eye could see, everything seemed lush and verdant. The desolate and terrifying impression the reporter had when traveling this road from Longyan to Liancheng in the spring three years ago was nowhere to be found. At that time, it was just after a great catastrophe. Whether in the mountains or on the plains, everything felt desolate. Along the way, none of the villages were intact, and among the broken tiles and dilapidated walls, it was difficult to see even a wisp of smoke. Tall blockhouses built of yellow earth were scattered everywhere. Now, in many villages, some have already built many new houses, and some are repairing broken houses. This scene, at least, proves that the people have had enough surplus to rebuild their lives after the disaster. Those who had left their homes to escape the disaster in the past have gradually returned. Most of the blockhouses have been demolished. Three years ago, there were very few pedestrians on this road. When one occasionally saw a few, they were ragged and looked hungry. Now, along the way, men and women carrying burdens are coming and going in an endless stream, and their faces show a new brilliance. There are also quite a few domestic animals in the farmhouses. These different scenes seen from the surface gave us a definite feeling that Western Fujian is reviving. Although the car journey was very arduous, the energetic scenery along the way made the reporter feel infinitely excited. As our car approached Longyan, in a small village, we saw many wounded armed comrades sitting and lying on the grass to bask in the sun and keep warm. Asking a fellow passenger, we learned that they were brave soldiers wounded in Xiamen and were recuperating in the rear hospital here. Immediately, a picture of bloody splendor flashed in my mind. The car arrived in Longyan at nearly three o'clock in the afternoon. The new atmosphere on the Longyan-Liancheng road made me feel great joy for the future of Western Fujian, which bears a great mission.

### Zhangjiagang - Ships Stop Docking - Because of Japanese Military Obstruction

Changyinsha Correspondence: Zhangjiagang is the most convenient port in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Since being occupied by the Japanese military and controlling tax revenues, ships have successively stopped docking and instead dock at Yangtan Port and Taizixu Port. However, because the sand beaches and ports are too far away, it is quite inconvenient. On the 6th of this month, German ships like Lu'an and Haikang tried hard to resume sailing. Subsequently, Schmidt & Co. established a transportation department. Unexpectedly, after only two voyages, they were stopped by the Japanese military in Zhangjiagang. Now, the ships are still docked at that port, and it will be difficult to resume operations in the short term.

### Suzhou Puppet Troops - Xu Jintang's Unit Disarmed - Puppet Troops Did Not Resist When Surrounded - Only Shouted "Chinese Don't Fight Chinese"

Suzhou Correspondence: Since the establishment of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government, all kinds of Japanese puppet organizations here have used various vicious methods to collect land rent from farmers in the surrounding countryside in order to eke out a living. However, the farmers in all the villages deeply understand the greater cause and refuse to pay rent to the Japanese puppets. Therefore, farmers in various villages are often brutally murdered. However, in the sections north of the railway line, they are all controlled by guerrilla forces. The Japanese puppets have not given up and secretly plan to launch rent collection. Since December last year, after the puppet rent collection director of Beiqiao, Li Chaoyuan, and the puppet assistant Zhou Xianwu, were killed by Hu's Volunteer Army of Yangcheng Lake, the Japanese puppet organization sent the puppet water police unit of Xu Jintang to invade Beiqiao in order to forcibly collect rent. At dawn on the 4th of this month, Volunteer Army Captain Hu suddenly led his troops to Beiqiao and surrounded the puppet army from all sides, ordering them to surrender all their weapons. It is said that when the puppet army was surrounded, they did not resist, but only climbed to the top of the house and shouted, "Chinese don't fight Chinese." At that time, the farmers of × village competed to put ladders against the walls to allow Hu's troops to rush in, showing where justice lies, and the people's hearts were united and excited. All the puppet army's guns and weapons were confiscated. At the same time, two puppet rent collectors were also severely beaten by the farmers and were seriously injured.

Lishui Guerrilla Force - Attacks Japanese Military in Three Locations - Japanese Military in the City Dare Not Move

Lishui Correspondence: The suburbs of Lishui are controlled by guerrilla forces. The Japanese military only lurks in the city. However, in the past week, there have been three guerrilla attacks on the Japanese military. One was in a village four li north of the county seat, where more than 100 guerrillas ambushed a small team of the Japanese garrison, nearly annihilating them. The next day, in the Honglanbu area, more than 200 guerrillas, with over 100 light machine guns, engaged in an encounter battle with the Oyama unit of the Japanese military in Lishui. After five hours, the Japanese military was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed, abandoning 20 corpses. Guns and ammunition were scattered in the valleys. The guerrillas then successively recaptured the villages and towns around Honglanbu. Also, guerrilla forces engaged in fierce battles with the Takenouchi unit of the Japanese military in the Sunjiaji area. At the same time, Yixing and Liyang were recaptured by the Chinese army, further posing a major threat to the Japanese military in Lishui.

A Glimpse Between Wuxi and Changzhou - Zhengdu Bridge's Entire City Reduced to Scorched Earth - The Japanese Military at Beiguo Conducts Very Strict Searches

Hupu Correspondence: In the Wuxi-Changzhou guerrilla area, a few towns and villages have been occupied by the Japanese military, and the people are suffering from their tyranny and are in great pain. Yesterday, a certain gentleman passed through Zhengdu Bridge, which belongs to the southeastern township, to Hupukou in Changshu to go to Shanghai. He heard and saw a few things along the way, and briefly described them. According to him, Zhengdu Bridge was a major town in Changzhou. In early December of the year before last, it was burned by the Japanese military, leaving only the remaining houses. The entire city was reduced to scorched earth. To Jiaoxi, there is a small puppet pacification team stationed in the Xi clan ancestral hall. The town was originally very lively, but recently it has been unusually desolate. One day, dozens of Japanese soldiers came from Nanha in Jiangyin to search the town. The puppet pacification team held up the Japanese flag to welcome them to the town market. Unexpectedly, the Japanese military did not realize the situation and mistook them for guerrilla forces, opening fire and killing seven or eight puppet team members. Later, they realized the misunderstanding. Continuing from the Xicheng Road to Tu Town to the south of Huashan, there is Quliyu Jiadai, a large village in Huashan. The farmers all practice martial arts, are brave and like to fight. They happened to be searched by the Japanese military throughout the village. More than 30 young and strong farmers were identified as suspected guerrillas and were all detained in the city. Their fate is uncertain. Because Qiaoqi was stationed by the Japanese military, the gentleman detoured along the foothills, passed Shishan, and arrived at Changshou. The town market was still good, with no trace of the Japanese military. Arriving at Huazhen, the situation was also good. Green and white flags were flying, and the mountain flowers seen on the road greeted people with a smile. The withered grass had already revealed green buds, containing the feeling of spring. The plants and trees know the time, but the people are no longer the same. One can't help but feel a sense of sorrow. In Huazhen, taking a small boat through Beiguo, because there were Japanese soldiers, the eastern and western market ends were searched twice in a row. Passengers' scattered items and legal tender were seized a lot. Regardless of gender, even clothes in pants had to be checked, and no one could escape. On the small boat, it took a day to reach Hupu. The Japanese military and puppet checkpoints were extremely harsh, delaying and extorting money. Because it was late, the gentleman stayed overnight in a small inn in Hupu. At dawn, he took a boat to Shanghai. Passing through the villages, the people's anti-Japanese sentiment has not diminished. However, it is difficult to obtain newspapers, and in terms of news, they are confused and ignorant.

### Kunshan Puppet Police Bureau - New Methods of Extortion - People Must Pay Fees for Weddings and Funerals

Kunshan Correspondence: The Kunshan puppet county government, because of the many puppet officials and huge expenses, and the field rent relied upon to maintain life brings in dismal income. Although puppet officials have recently been additionally assigned to go to various villages to forcibly urge collection, the farmers all hold a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the puppet county government has exhausted its plans, but there is no result. The puppet county magistrate feels very棘手 in this situation. The puppet police station's expenses are only raised by themselves. The puppet sub-bureaus of Kunshan County, such as Jiaozhi, Huangdun, Zhengyi, Zhangpu, Bacheng, and Zhoushu, have been instructed by the puppet main bureau to actively exploit the villagers, extorting and plundering. Relying on their power, they do everything. The villagers cry out in pain but have no way to appeal. Recently, it was heard that the puppet police bureau's police salaries have not been paid for three months. The puppet police are resigning one after another. The puppet director Pan Chen had an unexpected idea. The other day, he convened a meeting of his subordinates to discuss ways to extort money. It was decided that in addition to collecting vendor donations, residents must register with the bureau for weddings, funerals, and celebrations, and stipulate a registration fee. The rest are categorized and too numerous to list. The suffering of the people can be seen from this.

### Dinghai Prevents Traitors

Dinghai Correspondence: This county is surrounded by the sea on all sides and is located at the front line. Japanese warships frequently come to harass. In order to prevent traitors and bandits from infiltrating and to protect local security, the county authorities have decided that from the 25th, all kinds of boats sailing to the Toudou sea area must anchor 30 meters away from the shore first. Only after the water police team has inspected them will they be allowed to dock.

### Announcement by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to All Student Parents —And to All Children in Shanghai— Regarding Fundraising for Refugee Production and Education Expenses

The Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, for the purpose of raising 200,000 yuan for refugee production and education expenses, including Chen Heqin, Xi Yushu, and Chen Jiwei, have been hosting principals of elementary, middle, and high schools for days. Those who attended have all been happy to support the cause and have been making every effort to solicit donations from students across the city. Parents and students who have heard of this have all expressed a willingness to donate. Here are the "Announcement to All Student Parents in Shanghai" and "Announcement to All Children in Shanghai" from the Education Group:

Announcement to All Student Parents in Shanghai

An announcement from the Fundraising Committee of the Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to all student parents in Shanghai: Esteemed parents, we are dedicating one week starting from March 1st to exclusively raise funds for the production and education of Shanghai refugees. Presumably, upon hearing this news, you already understand the significance of this fundraising effort. There are still over ten thousand refugees in Shanghai who rely on relief to survive every day. Among them, there are old and young, men and women, just like our own families, with both young and old. The difference is that they have lost a happy family like ours. You can all imagine the sorrow in their hearts. Although their food, clothing, and shelter are being continuously provided by various sources, barely enough to sustain them, no one is making comprehensive plans for their future. No one can predict when the war will end. Even if the war ends one day, they may not be able to return safely. What will be the outcome if this continues? This is a serious issue that everyone recognizes.

In light of this, we have launched this fundraising campaign for refugee production and education, hoping that all esteemed parents can assist us. Our fundraising method is to take advantage of the Lunar New Year, when parents often give money to godchildren and younger relatives as New Year's gifts, "candy money," or other spending money for entertainment. We hope to save this money and donate it to the refugees for production and education expenses. We all know that while many children use this money for legitimate purposes, many also spend it frivolously. If you can guide them at this time to show sympathy for the refugees and turn useless things into useful things, you will directly help the refugees acquire productive skills and indirectly cultivate a spirit of mutual assistance in young people. Wouldn't it be a great thing to accomplish two things at once during the New Year?

According to our plan, donating one yuan can provide a refugee with five months of schooling or enable a refugee to learn a very practical skill. If over ten thousand refugees could become literate and acquire skills, then each refugee could become self-reliant, and the overall refugee problem could be solved from then on. Don't think that one or two yuan is insignificant. You must know that this is a general mobilization of the Shanghai education and cultural communities. When the total amount is collected, it will be considerable. The so-called "many hairs make a fur coat, many grains of sand make a pagoda" is what we mean. We estimate that if you can enthusiastically support us, we can raise at least 100,000 yuan in national currency with this effort. If we really have 100,000 yuan, then our planned and your concerned overall Shanghai refugee production education will become a possibility.

You may have already donated a lot to refugee relief, but this donation is an active form of relief with a lasting impact. It is worth your generosity once again. China's inherent morality has always advocated for benevolence and charity. We firmly believe that esteemed parents, in addition to donating yourselves, can enthusiastically promote and solicit donations from other relatives and friends. We have specially prepared a "Doing Good is the Greatest Joy" commemorative badge. For every yuan donated, one badge will be given as a memento. We anticipate that this fundraising campaign, with your enthusiastic assistance, will surely achieve our desired goals. We would like to express our gratitude in advance on behalf of the ten thousand refugees who are destitute and homeless, to all the great benefactors.

Announcement to All Children in Shanghai

An announcement from the Fundraising Committee of the Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to all children in Shanghai: Dear children, how happy you are! The Lunar New Year has arrived, you have new clothes to wear, delicious dishes to eat, and lucky money and spending money from your parents, relatives, and friends. Three or five jiao, one or two yuan – how happy you are to receive this money! Setting off firecrackers, wearing masks, buying candy, carrying lanterns, and visiting companies and watching movies – there are countless things to enjoy.

However, how many children of the same age as you and fellow citizens of the same age as your parents are also Chinese, also in Shanghai, but living in refugee shelters? Not only do they not have the blessing of enjoying the joys of the New Year, but even their meals and accommodation rely on donations from enthusiastic business and industrial compatriots for relief.

Now, thanks to the relief efforts of enthusiastic individuals, these homeless refugees are barely able to eat. However, they cannot have the opportunity to study like you, or have work like your older brothers and fathers. Dear children, don't you all know that by studying and understanding world affairs, you can contribute to the country? By engaging in production, you can not only become independent but also make the country rich and strong. If these many refugees cannot receive education or engage in production, it will not only cause them more suffering but also be a loss to the country. Dear children, can you bear to see refugees deprived of education and unable to engage in production? No, definitely not! Because loving one's own country is the nature of children, and those who love their country will definitely be willing to help suffering compatriots. One more educated and productive compatriot means one more helper and one more strength for the nation. Therefore, we believe that you can definitely contribute your own strength to help suffering compatriots receive education and engage in production.

Patriotic children, take advantage of this Lunar New Year season to donate your lucky money, save your spending money, and extend your hands to your parents, relatives, and friends to solicit donations. Accumulate one or two yuan to donate to the refugees for educational expenses and production costs.

Children throughout the city, let's mobilize! If each of you donates an average of one yuan, we will have 100,000 yuan. With this amount, we can educate thousands of refugees to become literate and understand national affairs, and we can enable tens of thousands of refugees to engage in production and enrich the national wealth. What a great patriotic act this is! To commemorate this great patriotic act of yours, we have prepared a shining and splendid Badge of Philanthropy to give to you. Anyone who donates one yuan can wear one, and the more you donate, the more you will receive. Moreover, there will be even better prizes. This badge of honor and these prizes are much more valuable than the toys you waste. See which child is the most patriotic and most willing to help the refugees, and which child has the most Badges of Philanthropy. Come on, two hundred thousand children in the city, let's have a heated patriotic and disaster relief competition! Shout out, two hundred thousand small voices in the city: (1) Give out lucky money, so that refugees can receive education! (2) Save spending money, so that refugees can engage in production! (3) Wear a Badge of Philanthropy, so that one more compatriot understands national affairs! (4) Donate more than ten yuan to increase the nation's countless combat capabilities!

### Opinions on Reforming Education in Shanghai Educational Circles —Five Major Issues in Promoting Vocational Supplementary Education Shanghai Municipal Association for Supplementary Education

Vocational supplementary education has a huge impact on the entire nation. The facts demonstrated by the powerful Western nations alone are sufficient proof, and the strength demonstrated by vocational youth during this war of resistance is also sufficient to show the importance of vocational supplementary education. After the war, we must of course devote ourselves to economic construction. How to train vocational youth to become the basic backbone of various vocational institutions and strengthen the driving force of economic construction is a prerequisite. At that time, the importance of vocational supplementary education will become even more apparent. Based on the above reasons, we would like to put forward a few opinions for your consideration:

(1) The Problem of the Educational System: Vocational supplementary education is a new undertaking in China, and there are no clear regulations regarding the educational system. The shortcomings of China's educational system have been fully exposed since this war and cannot be adequately adapted to the needs of the great era without thorough reform. The educational system should focus on all people, and all citizens have the right to enjoy secondary and higher education. Although the paths taken may not be the same due to different living environments, the qualifications obtained are the same. A simplified outline of the educational system is as follows:

(Note) Those who progress from elementary school to middle school to university are the bourgeoisie; those who progress from elementary school to vocational school to higher vocational supplementary school are the middle class; those who progress from elementary school or mass school to vocational supplementary school to higher vocational supplementary school are the proletariat. (2) The Problem of Academic Credits: Since vocational supplementary education has a clear position in the educational system, a related issue is that of academic credits. Of course, the grading level of vocational supplementary schools should be determined by the government in the future and should not be determined individually. However, the academic credits earned by students of vocational supplementary schools should also be treated equally with those of vocational schools. They can not only transfer to vocational schools with proof of their performance in vocational supplementary schools, but also, after completing enough credits and passing the government examination, they should be issued diplomas. In the past, only certificates of completion were issued, which was discriminatory.

(3) The Problem of Establishment: The establishment of vocational supplementary schools by private individuals or vocational groups was originally a temporary measure. In the future, the government should operate them. Even if social groups establish them, they should be approved by the government. Vocational institutions should absolutely not be allowed to establish vocational supplementary schools themselves to prevent the danger of capitalist enslavement education. There are similar regulations in Western countries.

(4) The Problem of Self-Cultivation: In addition to civic knowledge, vocational skills, and physical training, vocational supplementary schools should also pay attention to the self-cultivation of young people, not only to develop good habits of collective life but also to establish a correct vocational outlook on life so that vocational youth can become healthy citizens of the Three People's Principles Republic. However, the life experiences and needs of vocational youth are different from those of middle school students. The self-cultivation of vocational youth in vocational supplementary schools cannot be fully addressed by ordinary civic courses. The government should order all bookstores to submit all youth self-cultivation books for review. If there are excellent teaching materials, they should be approved. If none of them are suitable, experts with rich knowledge and experience can be asked to compile them within a limited time. If the self-cultivation plan is not determined, vocational supplementary education will lose its backbone, and all training cannot exert its concentrated effect.

(5) The Problem of Experimental Zones: Vocational supplementary schools must conduct practical research on curriculum, teaching materials, training, departments, etc. The government should select several particularly important areas in the country as experimental zones, allocate special funds, and instruct responsible agencies to conduct practical experiments and report the results within a limited time for reference by other regions. For example, Shanghai is the birthplace of vocational supplementary education and occupies an extremely important position. Since it has become an isolated island, it has not only not lost its importance but has actually become more special. If experimental zones are to be selected, Shanghai seems to be the first to be sent. (End)

Opening Commemorative Publication of the Jinmen Grand Theater

### Opening Remarks

— Tian Yunmeng

Film is the eighth art and an important tool for education. The children of the city, suffering from the torment and oppression of life, feel an inner distress that has reached its peak, and seeking new and normal stimulation is an inescapable reality. Therefore, the establishment of cinemas has become an urgent spiritual need.

In Shanghai, the number of cinemas is the highest in the country, but in terms of population density, it is clearly not enough. Especially in the residential area of ​​Western Shanghai, where countless hard-working citizens live. Under extreme fatigue, it is fundamentally impossible for them to find a perfectly equipped and modern cinema in the vicinity. Unless they drag their heavy steps and use the power of mechanical animals to go to the distant city center to enjoy and regulate their tired spirits.

Intuitively, we feel that building a modern cinema in the western district of Shanghai is an urgent task. Therefore, we gathered comrades and, after a considerable period of preparation, completed this Jinmen Grand Theater. We dare not say what excellent features this building has in terms of equipment, sound, light, and seating. Our greatest wish is to make every moviegoer feel "comfortable" everywhere they go when they step into this Jinmen Grand Theater, as if they were sitting on a sofa in their own home, enjoying the screen unfolding in front of them.

We hope that every audience member who comes to the Jinmen Grand Theater today will exchange a source of happiness and be filled with joy yesterday, today, and tomorrow. We respectfully use the words "Step into the Jinmen threshold, and good luck cannot be pushed away" as a eulogy dedicated to the entire theater audience!

### A Dissection of the Theater's Full Picture, Combining the Strengths of Many Theaters

Magnificent and Splendid · Palace of Film

The site of the Jinmen Grand Theater is located at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Alfread. It was originally an open-air skating rink called Ice Island. Later, Wufu Amusement Company leased it and spent a huge amount of capital to build this modern film palace. Undoubtedly, it assumes the important mission of instilling film education in the residential area of ​​western Shanghai.

The entire architectural plan was carefully structured by Xingye architect Zhao Bi, completely using three-dimensional lines to outline the contours of this film palace. The facade adopts the three-dimensional streamlined shape of Germany, using simple and unadorned lines to form a magnificent building. The structural materials are entirely artificial marble, four stories high, more than fifty feet long, and twelve feet wide. Each stage of the building is uneven, inlaid with blue neon lights. When the lights are turned on at night, it is like a lighthouse in the sea of ​​people. At the top is the Western text sign "Golden Gate", which is equipped with golden neon tubes from Lian Company. On the side walls on the left and right, the Chinese text signs of the Jinmen Grand Theater are horizontally hung, like a huge torch burning!

The central entrance is five golden and brilliant streamlined doors, inside which is a long passageway. The floor is paved with five-color artificial marble manufactured by Shanghai Millstone Factory. Ticket offices stand on both sides, the walls painted in light green tones. The ticket office is lined with four copper rods with a diameter of two inches to regulate the crowd. From here, you enter a foyer surrounded by an evening-hued purple atmosphere.

The theater pool is oval. Pushing open the two brown and bright theater doors, a vast scene emerges in front of you. More than a thousand seats are arranged in a scientific and economical way. At every angle, you can clearly see the action on the silver screen without the drawback of tilting. The carpet laid in the aisle is hand-woven by Hengfengyong, revealing a yellow-orange-brown color, exuding a warm temptation. The lights are hidden in the dark corners, emitting a secret light, spreading a light atmosphere like a dream.

The light brown tone on the walls and the tender ginger color of the ceiling are very harmoniously matched. The decoration by Deji Paint Workers clearly demonstrates extraordinary skills. In particular, the fabric color of the seats reflects the warm color of the evening glow, further highlighting the clouds and the moon. A little lighter is too plain, a little darker is too vulgar. This is the comfort that the artist gives to people spiritually. Stepping into the theater pool, a glance will set off a fermenting effect, evaporating a sweet secretion in the heart.

The wall lamps around are the ingenious design of architect Zhao Bi, and Dahua Water and Electricity completed this major mission. He mysteriously hid each bulb using the angular lines, and the light leaked out from the gaps, dripping and filtering at equal angles, so that in front of everyone's eyes, a soft brilliance flowed, seemingly immersed in the swaying spring light.

There are no balconies here. The reason is very simple. People who come to the cinema are prepared to receive comfortable enjoyment and want to reduce labor as much as possible. As soon as you enter the door, you can find a comfortable sofa-like seat. Once you sit down, you can relax half of your tired body and mind, and then watch a one-hour and forty-minute screen performance. The nerves that go in and out have passed through the entertainment sand filter, eliminating the dregs of fatigue and infusing new vitality.

A purple-red curtain hangs high on the stage in front, and the golden tassels make the air in the entire theater very warm. Especially, the lines of the theater pool take the stage as the focal point, summarizing the lines extending throughout the theater, so that everyone's attention is also focused on the final scene – the stage. The sound system uses the Elsia high-fidelity original sound system, and the sound emitted is exactly the same as the original person's tone. The projector is a Simplex, which is an old-fashioned machine used by cinemas all over the world.

The biggest drawback of sound films is the echo of the past, which disturbs the audience's hearing. Therefore, the walls of the entire theater are equipped with soft soundproofing equipment, and the upper part is covered with sound-absorbing paper. This kind of paper is the latest scientific invention of Bilishi. It is the first time it has been used in the Far East, and it can absorb harsh sounds and transform them into soft tones. Every word and every sentence is clearly sent into everyone's ears.

In public places, the most important project is the air conditioning equipment. The old-fashioned equipment in ordinary cinemas is equipped with ventilation pipes under each seat to absorb the turbid air. The drawback is that the audience feels the invasion of cold air under their feet. Here, the gas cylinder that absorbs turbid air is modified in front of the stage, and the equipment that sends fresh air is also used to breathe indirectly, so that the audience in the entire theater receives the change of fresh air in general invisibly. Benefits are gained both in body and mind.

The films shown are all regulated. Any famous and super-special films will not be shown for more than three days. The date of film change is also fixed, which is Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. The seat prices are divided into three types: three jiao, five jiao, and eight jiao, plus a 10% refugee donation. The latter can be reserved, and the phone number for seat reservations is 74456. Telephone reservations start at 10:00 am every day and are reserved until five minutes before the screening. There are three screenings every day, at 2:30, 5:30, and 9:00. On Sundays, there is an additional morning screening at 10:30 am.

The manager's office and the office are both next to the lighthouse, as if guarding the lighthouse, indicating a normal route of entertainment, and sailing every audience member to a safe and happy destination.

### Sound, Light, and Seating

For cinemas showing dialogue films, the sound part has a very important key. If the sound insulation equipment is not thoughtful enough, the sound emitted from the screen will be differentiated from the original sound, with slight differences. Hearing is the most sensitive organ, and no one can block its acceptance. If there is any abnormality, it will affect other organs and feel very uncomfortable.

Therefore, the sound insulation equipment must not be handled vaguely. The upper half of the walls of the Jinmen Grand Theater are completely covered with the latest sound insulation paper invented by Bilishi. The lower half is completely made of cork, so that no part has the disturbance of stimulating sound waves.

The sound machine installed in Jinmen is produced by the world-renowned Elsia company. It has undergone major improvements over the years. It has built a strong reputation for its reliability among film companies and cinemas in Europe and the United States. This sound machine is a 1939 giant super-special original sound type. It uses the latest scientific methods to introduce the original voices of famous celebrities from all over the world to every audience member, as if sitting in front of that group of bigwigs, listening to their conversations. This is the sound part.

The lighting department also has careful arrangements. A pair of light boxes is custom-made according to the size of the machine room. Its style is the latest type in Shanghai, automatically concentrated, extracting the advantages of past inventions, and eliminating the shortcomings left over in the past. When a pair of coking coal burns, it reflects a specially manufactured reflector in New York, USA, which will never have a pale yellow or overly bright glare. This bright beam of light passes through a deep lens and shines on the silver screen, which is as white and bright as the white snow in winter.

Walking into the dark theater pool, because the light is white, there is no need to use a flashlight to illuminate it, and you can vaguely see the eyebrows of the guests.

In sound, we must achieve the word "accurate"; in light, we must achieve the word "white and clean". Accuracy and cleanliness complete the mission of sound and light.

Seating also occupies a very important part in the cinema. Because the condition for watching a movie is that you must sit, there is absolutely no example of watching standing up. Imagine for an hour and a half. If the structural part of the seat has not been explored, the person sitting will eventually feel sore and straight in the back, numb and wooden. Therefore, for the structure of the seat, the first thing to do is to eradicate the above drawbacks. First, improve the style, with the back slightly rounded to conform to the human skeleton. At the joint of the waist, the chair body swells accordingly, precisely supporting the soft bones of the waist and reducing the effort. Secondly, increase the number of springs and improve the lining, replacing it with soft yellow hemp palm. The armrests on both sides are also specially widened so that the audience's arms have room to move around.

At the same time, in order to adapt to the body shape of Chinese people with short upper bodies and long lower bodies, the seat itself is lowered so that everyone's heels can comfortably step on the ground, and the legs will not have the drawback of soreness and numbness.

The above three points of sound, light, and seating are all improved by experimental methods. We dare not boast how perfect they are. Anyway, the fact is ironclad evidence. The audience should experience it for themselves!

### Route Compass

The Jinmen Grand Theater is completely surrounded by a car road network. Buses 9 and 2, which travel between the east and west districts, pass by the theater every day, west to Anhua Temple Road and east to Baidu Bridge. Movie fans living on Robertson Road in the British Concession can also take the Route 24 trolleybus that runs through the British and French Concessions. The station is diagonally opposite the theater.

Behind the theater on Rue Puech, there is the main road of Route 22 of the French Concession. Viewers living on Avenue Petain in Xujiahui only need to spend a few cents to get off at the Rue Puech and Route Alfread intersection station, and walk a few steps north to reach Jinmen. The bus terminal for Route 14 from the Bund to Avenue Foch offers a view of the Jinmen Grand Theater's towering roof.

From a transportation point of view, it can be said to be extremely convenient. In terms of time, moviegoers in the western district originally had to waste half an hour's journey to see a movie. Now they have unknowingly saved a lot of time. The time is saved, and the movies are all good movies. The spirit is adjusted by this, and it is a win-win situation. This is the New Year's gift that "Jinmen" gives to moviegoers. At the same time, "Jinmen"'s external slogan is: "Get the enjoyment of a first-class theater at the price of a second-class theater." It is hoped that every moviegoer will feel the truth of these two slogans.

### City Party Headquarters Urges All Compatriots to Diligently Save and Assist Those in Need, Business Community Voluntarily Offers Income Tax

Today is the Lunar New Year's Eve. Citizens are accustomed to old customs and tend to be wasteful. At a time when the war against aggression is in full swing, the people should save material and financial resources to support the soldiers at the front and the refugees in the rear. The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters has issued two announcements to the public to encourage them, which are recorded as follows: "Compatriots of Shanghai, since the retreat of the national army to the west, the torch of full-scale resistance has spread throughout China. During this period of the entire nation striving for the final victory, the isolated island of Shanghai has developed abnormally, with numerous entertainment venues and crowded hotels and restaurants. We believe that this phenomenon is caused by a portion of our compatriots who love the country but cannot find the right direction for their efforts, so they become passive and decadent, indulging in sensual pleasures. If this abnormal phenomenon cannot be corrected immediately, it will directly or indirectly reduce the unlimited power of the resistance. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, it is a good opportunity to test whether we can correct this abnormal mentality. It is also a good time for us to save material and financial resources, contribute to the government, relieve refugees, and support the resistance. I hope that all compatriots in the city will practice what they preach and persuade their relatives and neighbors to diligently follow the following two things:

(1) Citizens should strive to save and rescue. All the money wasted on New Year's wine, New Year's gifts, spring wine, gambling, and worshiping gods during the Lunar New Year should be saved to help the refugees in Shanghai. We must know that while we are drinking and feasting, countless refugees are crying for food and warmth. We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor and children of China. On this isolated island that has been occupied, if we don't help them, who will? Compassion is the precious spirit of a nation. We should promote this compassion to enhance our national status, especially since we are all in the same boat in this situation. (2) The business community should voluntarily offer the income tax payable for the year to the government. When the Ministry of Finance of the National Government implemented the income tax, it received unanimous support from the people of the country, because the income tax is indeed a good, reasonable, and progressive tax system. Now that Shanghai has become an isolated island, the people of Shanghai support the government and abide by the laws even more than before. According to investigations, many Shanghai businesses voluntarily offer income tax to the government. I hope that all banks, companies, shops, factories, bookstores, etc. in the city will enthusiastically offer their annual profits, which will definitely be of great help to the sacred national resistance.

### Calling for Thrift and Economy During the New Year Festivities

The Thrift and Relief Committee, based on a proposal by Ying Yongyu, called on all sectors to save on the cost of the Spring Festival. After the banks open on the 23rd of this month, they should automatically deposit the money under the account for saving and relief. The original text says, "The Lunar New Year is approaching in the blink of an eye. According to the old custom, families are busy preparing for the New Year these days. In this extraordinary period, everyone should practice thrift and relief. Unnecessary socializing for the Lunar New Year should be reformed. New Year's greetings should be abolished immediately, and New Year's expenses should also be saved. Children should save their lucky money, candy money, and other toy money and send them to the banks that collect savings for relief as refugee relief funds. They should also wear thrift badges. Those who have already donated savings should especially lead by example and actively advocate for it."

Implementing Disaster Relief Donations in Dance Halls

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association issued its 16th public announcement yesterday. Starting from February 17th, refugee relief funds will be collected in dance halls. The method is as follows: For dance tickets with five or fewer tickets per yuan, each customer will be charged 10 cents in national currency for each bill. For those with more than five tickets per yuan, each customer will be charged 5 cents in national currency for each bill.

Agreement on Commission for Sauce and Liquor Postponed

The Sauce and Liquor Industry Fundraising Committee decided that each industry should use the transaction volume of door cylinder oil goods as the standard for the sauce and liquor industry to provide a commission to recognize the refugee relief fund. Five cents will be levied for each dan (equivalent to 25% of the value of the goods), all of which will be used for disaster relief. It will be implemented on March 1.

Famous Actors and Actresses Mobilize Together

The Amateur Performers Fundraising Committee, in order to expand the recruitment force, is taking advantage of the Spring Festival to hold a fundraising broadcast and invited famous amateur performers and actors from all over Shanghai to participate in the mobilization. The famous amateur performers include Sun Junqing, Jin Yuansheng, Zhao Peixin, Sun Lanting, Jiang Bogong, Bao Xiaodie, Xie Baosheng, Fan Hengde, Wang Jinghu, Yuan Senzhai, Luo Quyuan, Cao Bingsheng's wife, Ning Xuan, Wu Jiangfeng, Yu Yungu, Zhang Zhesheng, Wang Zhunchen, Chen Liangwang, Yuan Ludeng, Xie Zhifang's wife, Wan Molin, Zhang Zhongyuan, Xia Yuyang, Jin Yuanlin, Huang Xiubo, and more than 600 others. The famous actors and actresses include Zhang Tuiyun, Ye Shengdan, Zhou Xinfang, Jin Suqin, Huang Guiqiu, Yang Maisen, Gao Baisui, Chen Hefeng, Yun Yanxia, Wang Xichun, Mao Jianqiu, Zhao Songqiao, Guan Shaohua, and Liu Wenkui. It is unprecedented to gather famous actors and actresses from all over Shanghai in one hall. The broadcast conference is scheduled to be held at the Sino-French Pharmacy Continental Radio Station for two days starting tomorrow. At the same time, all major radio stations in the city will broadcast simultaneously from 4:00 pm to 4:00 am. During this Spring Festival period, it is not easy to have the opportunity to listen to famous songs and support charity. Therefore, we hope that you will enthusiastically request songs and donate generously. The radio station's telephone numbers are 92588, 92331, 92332, and 92333.

### Lunar New Year's Eve Today, Market Stability and Steady Business for All Industries, Silver and Money Industries to Take a Four-Day Holiday Starting Tomorrow, Ready to Resume Business on the 23rd

Today is the general closing period for all industries in Shanghai. Due to the stable financial market and the abnormal development of various industries in the concessions, they can all safely pass this Lunar New Year. Qianzhuang banks will take a four-day holiday starting tomorrow and will resume business on February 23. The money industry decided to hold an annual meeting after the general closing period to discuss new business policies after listing. Details are as follows:

Extended Period to Increase Exchange

Today is Lunar New Year's Eve. (1) Qianzhuang handles the general closing. The internal office hours will last until dawn. The time for receiving tickets will be 4:00 pm for market mutual receipt of tickets, and each zhuang will charge its own ticket until 6:00 pm. The money industry market will be closed starting today, and each zhuang will take a four-day holiday starting tomorrow to rush to the end. (2) Banks will extend internal office hours according to their own business conditions due to the general closing of various industries. In addition to the 3 o'clock session today, the bank bill exchange will temporarily add a session at 5:00 pm. Each bank will take a four-day Spring Festival holiday starting tomorrow.

Market Stabilizes to Pass the New Year

Due to the adjustment of the four major banks of the Central Agricultural Bank, the Shanghai financial market remains stable as always. After the war, various industries have developed abnormally, so various industries can repay their debts to Qianzhuang as scheduled, which is very different from previous years. After the general settlement of each Qianzhuang, they have all made a slight profit, so the 43 member Qianzhuang can definitely be fully listed on schedule after the general settlement. As for Zhuang such as Shun Kang, Fu Yuan, Fu Kang, and Wu Feng, they have all been reorganized and the internal organization is more substantial. They will do their best to support the development of industry and commerce. It is heard that the Qianzhuang Association will hold an annual meeting at the Beishi Guild Hall to discuss new business policies after the general closing.

### Rumors of Japanese Warships Bombarding Inaccurate, Haimen Tranquil as Always, Foreign Ships Leave Taiwan Route and Temporarily Suspend, Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo Routes Operate as Usual

Since the Japanese side notified the consulates of various countries stationed in Shanghai, claiming that they would take military action in Haimen, Zhejiang, and limited all foreign ships to leave Taizhou before the evening of the 17th, the Portuguese merchant ship Shantailun, which was docked in Taiwan, sailed to Shanghai yesterday morning, and Meda sailed to Ningbo. Yesterday morning, it was rumored in the city that Japanese warships had shelled Haimen, but after inquiries from all parties, it was completely inaccurate. Haimen was still tranquil as always until yesterday and there were no changes. The Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo routes still operate as usual. Details are as follows:

Foreign Ships in Jiaojiang Divert to Shanghai and Ningbo

After the consulates of various countries stationed in Shanghai received the Japanese notification, they immediately notified their respective shipping companies. Since it was near the end of the general closing period, the Shanghai-Taiwan line ships originally planned to suspend operations, so only one Portuguese merchant ship Shantailun docked in Taiwan was ordered to leave Taiwan for Shanghai at 6:00 am yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai this morning. The US merchant Meda arrived in Taiwan from Wenzhou and sailed to Ningbo to temporarily dock at 5:00 pm the day before yesterday (according to the original plan, the ship was scheduled to sail to Ningbo). The US merchant Tangbei, which was originally scheduled to sail to Taiwan for the New Year, has temporarily suspended operations, so there are no foreign ships in Haimen Jiaojiang.

Rumors of Shelling Haimen Inaccurate

Yesterday morning, it was rumored in the city that Japanese warships had shelled Haimen at around 8:00 am. The news was spread by a certain bank, and the atmosphere among all parties concerned was slightly tense for a while. However, after inquiring with the shipping industry, the news was completely inaccurate. It was purely a speculation by generally nervous people. The Japanese side issued a notification limiting foreign ships to leave Taiwan by the evening of the 17th, so even if military action is taken, it must be after this deadline. Moreover, according to general observations, although the Japanese side has claimed to attack, it is quite threatening. Before the fact occurs, it is not worth paying attention to.

### Japanese Daizhi Motor Vehicle Again Ambushed by Chinese Army, Killing Three Japanese Soldiers Escorting the Vehicle and Several Passengers, Elite Chinese Army Has Crossed into the Alert Zone and is Active

After the Jiangnan guerrillas were actively adjusted and reorganized by the Third War Zone Command, their strength became more sufficient. Their elite troops have crossed into the railway and highway lines in the Japanese army's alert zone to carry out various sabotages and attacks. Japanese merchant passenger and freight vehicles traveling on the Xihu Road are often intercepted, and the freight transport is miserable. Many railway bridges have also been bombed. The details are as follows as investigated by the Modern News Agency reporter:

Elite Chinese Army Crosses Alert Zone

According to reports from relevant parties, there are more than 300,000 Chinese troops in various counties in Jiangnan, from the outskirts of Shanghai to Qixia Mountain in Nanjing, responsible for guerrilla work. Except for the areas above Zhenjiang, which are commanded by Xiang Ying and Ye Ting of the New Fourth Army, the areas below Zhenjiang are generally presided over by the Commander-in-Chief of the Third District of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The teams scattered from various places will be reorganized, and cadres will be selected and sent to Huaiyin for training. The students of the first and second classes have completed their training and have been dispatched by the authorities to various places to serve, supervise, and guide various organizations of the military and civilians. Currently, the elite troops of the Chinese army have crossed into the Japanese army's alert zone to engage in secret work, and the results are remarkable. The Japanese side is deeply panicked due to the disparity in the rear forces.

Japanese Merchant Vehicles Often Attacked

Passenger and freight vehicles of Daizhi Motor Transport Company, which is hosted by Japanese merchants, are often attacked by elite troops of the Chinese side when traveling on the Xihu Road. On the 16th of this month, they were suddenly intercepted by the Chinese army at the Zhitang Station on the border of Changshu and Taicang. At that time, three Japanese soldiers escorting the vehicle fired warning shots. The Chinese army besieged the core and retaliated. As a result, the freight vehicle was pierced through, and in addition to the three Japanese soldiers, who were killed in the carriage, four or five innocent Chinese passengers were also sacrificed. Moreover, when the Chinese army left, they disassembled the engine and took it away along with the goods.

Traffic Control Exhausted

The Japanese side has increased the number of Japanese soldiers protecting the road to protect the traffic and has done its utmost to implement various strict and necessary methods, but it is still difficult to control. For example, the highway bridge signs are burned, the railway tracks are pried off, or Japanese military vehicles and passenger vehicles are attacked, at least a dozen times a week. None of them were discovered by the Japanese side in advance. The Chinese army, which is responsible for the sabotage work, is selected from the troops who are alert, good at running, and elite. When the Japanese army passes by, they hide, and after the Japanese army leaves, they become active again. Their actions are very agile.

### Welcoming and Protecting Foreign Nationals in Kuling, US Naval Commander Climbs the Mountain, Chinese Government Only Allows One Person to Pass, Some Foreign Nationals Want to Leave

According to Continental News, the Japanese military authorities previously ordered foreign nationals in Kuling to withdraw before February 10th, and then extended the deadline to the 20th. The British and American naval authorities recently received a notification from the Chinese government, stating that only one person is allowed to pass through the Chinese military formation. Therefore, it was decided that the commander of the US ship Wuhu, Navy Commander Geff, will represent the British and American naval authorities and climb Kuling this morning (17th). Some of the foreign nationals currently living on the mountain are willing to withdraw, so everyone believes that Geff will return with the foreign nationals who wish to withdraw.

Local Situation Peaceful as Always

According to a telegram received by a certain shipping company in the city from the Haidou branch at 5:00 pm yesterday, the situation there is still very peaceful. All shops are operating as usual, and people are very calm. However, the authorities have taken emergency precautions against Jiaojiang, and the local military, police, and militia are on standby to prevent any eventuality. Therefore, if the Japanese invade, they will undoubtedly be hit hard.

Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Wenzhou Operate as Usual

The Shanghai-Taiwan route has been completely suspended since yesterday. As for the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the Moufu and Deping ships sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai at 4:00 pm yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai this morning. The Moufu ship plans to enter the British Rui Rong Shipyard for a year-end overhaul and is expected to leave the dock in two days. It plans to sail directly to Ningbo on the 21st as usual. The Deping ship will also sail to Ningbo on the 21st after unloading cargo in Shanghai. The Tangsai ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 22nd. As for the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, the Kangshayi ship of the Zhongyi Company is scheduled to sail to Wenzhou this morning. Bao Li, Tangbei, Feikang, and Meifa ships are scheduled to sail to Wenzhou or Shanghai on the 21st and 22nd, and will not be hindered by the Japanese notification.

### Japanese Army and Navy in Hupu Compete for the Truth of Export Rice Tax, Japanese Navy Strafes Rice Barges and Boatmen Die, Tonghe Ship Has Returned to Shanghai and the Impoundment is Inaccurate

Recently, a large amount of rice and grain from Hupu has been transported to foreign seas. The rice and grain are purchased by people sent by the Hakka gang to Wuxi and Changshu production areas and transported to Hupu Port by small barges and transferred to large ships. The area is a guerrilla area, and the export tax is received by the puppet organization and the Japanese army. The Japanese navy is therefore coveting it and also wants to share the profits. The Japanese army ignored it, and the two sides had opinions. The Japanese navy sent ships to throw anchors outside the port. When they saw rice barges sailing out, they would shoot at them at any time. The other day, a rice barge was strafed by the Japanese navy with machine guns when it sailed out of the port, and two boatmen were killed and one was injured. The rice barges did not dare to sail away. As for the Yih Tonghe ship, the situation of being impounded for loading rice is a misrepresentation. The ship returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to people from Hupu, the misunderstanding between the Japanese army and navy was mediated by people. There are not many days left in the Lunar New Year, and we will discuss it next year. Therefore, the rice barges that were stranded in the port for several days have been exported and unloaded on the Gonghe and Wuhu ships of Taigu Qiahe Company, which are anchored outside the port, waiting for large ships to transport them.

### Japanese Side Willing to Cooperate with the Public Works Department to Curb Terrorist Activities, Japanese Consul Officially Notifies the Public Works Department, But the French Concession Has Not Received a Letter

According to Continental News, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai yesterday (16th) sent an official note to the chairman of the Public Works Department, Fan Keling, urging both sides to cooperate during the Lunar New Year to curb disturbances in the Public Concession. The dispute over terrorist activities in the Public Concession has been revived by this move. According to a Japanese spokesman at a press conference last night, the note was sent to Fan Keling by the Japanese Consul General Miura at the request of the commander of the Shanghai Japanese Marine Corps on Wednesday. It stated that the Japanese authorities are preparing for various precautions to prevent terrorist incidents from occurring next week and hope that the Public Works Department authorities will fully cooperate. The spokesman replied to questions that the Japanese side did not send a letter to the French Concession authorities.

US Consul Couple Arrive in Shanghai

According to the Shanghai Times, the new US Deputy Consul General in Shanghai, Su Weisi, and his wife arrived in Shanghai on the President Taft ship yesterday (16th).

### Public Works Department Raises Salaries, Investigation Completed

According to the English Great Beauty Evening News, the committee of business representatives appointed by the Public Works Department to investigate the salary increase of senior officials of the Public Works Department has been completed and has submitted a report to the Public Works Department. It is expected that the bureau will publish several documents in a few days.

### Lunar New Year's Eve as Usual, Request for Accommodation Not Approved

The local department store industry, on the occasion of this Lunar New Year, each shop is handling the general closing. Lunar New Year's Eve is the period for shops to collect accounts. In order to facilitate the handling of shop affairs at night, the industry association sent a letter to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, requesting accommodation to lift the curfew on the night of Lunar New Year's Eve. It is understood that the matter was reviewed by the concession authorities, who believed that it was a matter of maintaining local security and could not be approved. They have replied to the industry yesterday.

At the meeting of the Chinese Economic Construction Society yesterday, Standing Committee Member Huang Yuzhai felt that if the curfew was still in place at the general closing, the industrial and commercial circles would not be able to collect as much as possible, which was very painful. Therefore, Huang and others listed their names to appeal to the merchants in the city, requesting the Public Works Department to lift the curfew on New Year's Eve to benefit the merchants and people.

### Chamber of Commerce Re-Elects to Allow Tung Oil and Leather to be Shipped to Shanghai, Check the Instructions in the True Telegram, Release with the Chamber of Commerce Certificate

Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs allowed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to request that six kinds of prohibited goods, including bamboo, wood paper, eggs, cotton, and firewood, be allowed to be shipped from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces with a certificate from the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations are now rushing to process the certificates. At the same time, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce also stated that tung oil and leather are also daily necessities. Yesterday, it continued to telegraph the two ministries of finance and economy, requesting that the method of bamboo and wood be used to release with the Chamber of Commerce certificate. The two telegrams are recorded as follows:

Telegram 1

Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, tung oil is necessary for furniture and fishing gear coating, and it has been a long time since. The Ministry is well aware of the situation. Furthermore, the quality of tung oil for domestic sales is different from that for foreign sales, and there is no need to mix them up. This time, the Wen Trade Adjustment Committee of Zhejiang Province and the Wartime Property Adjustment Office discussed that 5% of the total tung oil export quota should be withdrawn from the foreign sales goods for domestic sales, which will not harm the national economy and will benefit the people's livelihood, which is consistent with the Ministry of Economic Affairs' true telegram, which allows the products of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi to be reported and released in the Shanghai Concession area with a certificate from the group. It is reasonable to report the situation and request the approval of the Ministry to allow the competent authorities of Zhejiang Province to release them at any time, so that the products of Zhejiang Province can flow smoothly and the Shanghai market can avoid the lack of fir supply. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce humbly awaits orders.

Telegram 2

Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the leather factories in Nanshi and Zhabei of Shanghai moved to the western district of the Public Concession and the French Concession after the war. There are many companies that are trying to start work. Their purchase of raw cowhide as raw materials has been certified by the member association to the trade committees in various places, and there have been many requests for shipping permits. However, since the promulgation of the regulations prohibiting the transportation of enemy materials, the officials in various places will not be able to transfer them to Shanghai because they are following the laws. If the leather factories are forced to close down, not only will the daily needs of the residents be lacking, but also the foreign goods may be dumped, which will increase the leakage, which is not a way to take into account the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is found that the Ministry has set a considerable flexible method for the transportation and sale of paper, eggs, cotton, and tea to Shanghai, and it is also deeply admired to take into account both. I believe that the daily needs of the people, produced in the mainland and sold in the concessions, are not limited to the above items. However, as long as the responsibilities are strictly defined and properly audited, there will be no abuses. It is reasonable to telegram the Ministry and request the review and approval of the provisions of the True Telegram, and to designate one by one the items that are transported to Shanghai for domestic sale, and allow the Chamber of Commerce to be responsible for the certification and report to the customs at any time for release, so that the purpose of facilitating the people's use is still implied in the prevention of aiding the enemy. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce humbly prays.

### Sand and Stone Industry Association Asks for Help

The Sand and Stone Industry Association sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayer Association of the Public Concession and the United Association of Citizens of the First Special District of Shanghai yesterday. The original text is as follows: (Omitted above) It is found that the yellow sand is produced in Chongming Sijiao. All the sand transport ships hired by the members of the association are estimated to be no less than 200 ships, which sail to the area to transport yellow sand, and are free to enter and exit without any hindrance. Even if the members buy and sell to each other, there is no monopoly. However, since the organization of the company, the situation is special. On the one hand, the so-called sand and stone maintenance association is organized in Sijiao, limiting all the 200 sand transport ships to 60 ships, and they must obtain the company's shipping voucher before they can go to the area to transport sand. The sand must be unloaded and sold by the company when it arrives in Shanghai. In this situation, the source of sand and stone in Shanghai is completely monopolized and controlled by the company. Not only is the business of the members affected, but also the livelihood of tens of thousands of boatmen and coolies is difficult to maintain. The association is limited by the environment and is unable to do what it wants. Therefore, it sends this letter to the association for fairness and asks for assistance.

The City's Total Trade Volume Decreased Last Year, Stable Domestic Market, Effective Control, Shanghai Market Declined Unaffected

Shanghai is the center of national trade and the economic hub. It is the only major port in the Far East. The import and export last year decreased the most compared with the previous year, while other parts increased. The total trade volume in Shanghai decreased by 46.2%, while other parts increased by 31.7%. The total import volume in Shanghai decreased by 47.1%, while other parts increased by 38.8%. The total export volume in Shanghai decreased by 45%, while other parts increased by 24.5%. This result proves the stability of domestic trade and the effectiveness of controlled foreign trade. After Shanghai fell, its import and export could not be directly controlled by the national government, and its decline strengthened the effectiveness of the national government's controlled trade in other parts.

### Japan's Crisis is Approaching, More Than 370,000 People are Unemployed, Price Level Increases Dramatically, Actual Salary is Lower Than Before

According to Continental News, Japan's economic crisis is increasing. One of its obvious signs is that Japanese commercial production has changed from peacetime commerce to wartime commerce, and many people are unemployed as a result. As of November last year, no less than 88,000 low- and middle-level industrial and commercial households have lost their businesses or occupations due to the so-called mobilization methods implemented since June last year. According to the report submitted by the Tokyo Ministry of Commerce and Industry to the National Assembly, there are still 286,000 employees in Japanese peacetime industry and commerce who have also been laid off. Among the people affected by these mobilization methods, Tokyo has the largest number. As of December 1 last year, the number of unemployed people in the Japanese headquarters was 375,000. Although Japanese industrialists claim that the salaries of Japanese employees have increased greatly since the outbreak of the war, according to a survey of Japanese salaries by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the situation is just the opposite. Nominally, since June of the previous year, domestic salaries in Japan have increased by 17.4%, but the price level has increased by 22.5% during the same period, so the actual salary is lower than before.

### Shanghai-Qingpu Road Guerrillas Bomb Bridges, Heavy Japanese Casualties in Qibao, Extreme Tension West of Hongqiao

For the past few months, clear artillery fire has been heard west of the concessions. The Japanese military authorities have also acknowledged guerrilla warfare near the suburbs of Shanghai but have not specified the exact locations. According to information gathered by a reporter from the Modern News Agency, these guerrilla operations are taking place along the Shanghai-Qingpu Road. Guerrilla units in the area have attacked the Japanese garrison in Qibao twice, causing heavy casualties on the Japanese side. Two bridges on the road have been destroyed by our forces, cutting off traffic on the Shanghai-Qingpu Road. Large numbers of Japanese reinforcements are now rushing to the area to fight, and they are shelling and massacring the countryside. The area west of Hongqiao has been under heavy guard for days, and the situation remains extremely tense.

### The Yellow Peril in Northern Jiangsu: Han Guojun's Suggestion, Quickly Build the Sanhe Grass Dam, Dredge the Zhangfu Diversion Canal

The Shanghai Northern Jiangsu International Relief Committee recently received a letter from Han Guojun, a prominent figure in Haian, Jiangsu Province, stating: "Regarding the flood problem in Northern Jiangsu, I have repeatedly telegraphed various parties for help. Recently, Zheng Quanbo from Chongqing wrote that there are two breaches in the Yellow River. The Zhao River breach has not yet been surveyed, and the Huayuankou breach is 363 meters wide. The main river stopped flowing on November 20th, and all the flow is pouring down through the breaches. Now, the floodwater is entering Honghu Lake and is not being discharged smoothly. If the breaches are not blocked, Northern Jiangsu will suffer unimaginable consequences. Even seeking help from the League of Nations may not yield concrete solutions. The Yellow River Water Disaster Committee is currently unable to take action." According to the above, blocking the breaches poses problems. Furthermore, gentlemen from Jiangsu and water conservancy experts in Chongqing telegraphed three suggestions: 1. Negotiate with international charitable organizations in Shanghai to raise funds. 2. Encourage the people to build earthen mounds to reduce land area and raise the ground to avoid flooding. 3. Cooperate in appealing for the necessary funds. However, as far as Jiangsu Province is concerned, there are only two methods: flood prevention and drainage. It would be best to strengthen the dikes of Honghu Lake and the western dikes of the Grand Canal, divert water to the Five Ports in the east, and strengthen the dikes of the Zhongshan River and the Chengzi River to increase the amount of seawater discharged. Or build more earthen mounds, or construct ditches and canals east of the Fan Dike to facilitate relocation. The so-called blocking the breaches, addressing the root cause, is the best strategy. Since there are many obstacles and it cannot be implemented immediately, the mound field option cannot be completed in a short time due to the lack of soil. The Zhongshan River is already blocked, and the Zhangfu Diversion Canal has a higher elevation and has been accumulating sediment over the years. The Chengzi River has no dikes, and building dikes in the water is impossible. The dredging of channels east of the Fan Dike, to create waterways to the sea, is already underway for this purpose, but the funding is only 200,000 yuan, which is far from sufficient. In Guojun's opinion, the only solution is to quickly build the Sanhe Grass Dam, making it higher and thicker than in previous years, and to dredge the Zhangfu Diversion Canal so that when Honghu Lake floods, water can flow from the Zhangfu River into the Zhongshan River and then into the abandoned Yellow River. Even if the river changes course, this can serve as a route for the Yellow River to flow into the sea. If these measures are not taken soon, the floodwaters will overflow, and Northern Jiangsu will be completely submerged. This can be considered a medium-term flood prevention strategy. The estimated cost is only 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. For those who will manage, we can ask those who worked on the Northern Jiangsu flood relief projects of the twentieth year of the Republic of China to come forward to preside, it would be most appropriate. If international appeals can secure half of the funds, and then we jointly telegraph the central government to requisition labor for dredging, the accumulated water in Northern Jiangsu will have an outlet, and the lives and property of millions will be protected."

### Japan's New Economic Law, Obscure Meaning, Merchants Unclear on Its Effects, 200,000 People Arrested

The Continental News reports that a member of the Japanese Minseito party revealed during questioning in the Diet that in recent months, no fewer than 200,000 Japanese merchants have been arrested for violating economic and financial laws or regulations. The legislator also told the Minister of Commerce and Industry that in many cases, Japanese police were clearly unclear about Japan's new economic laws. The Minister of Commerce and Industry replied that the full text of Japan's new economic laws contained many excessively vague terms.

### Large Quantities of Counterfeit Currency Shipped Out of Hongkou, Concessions Strictly Suppressing, Manufacturing Center Also Within Hongkou District, Attempt to Disrupt Our Country's Financial Monetary System

Recently, the market has been flooded with counterfeit currency, mostly fake legal tender from the Chinese Farmers Bank. A slight oversight can easily lead to deception. Concession authorities are now strictly investigating and cracking down, and several cases have already been uncovered. It has been learned that this counterfeit currency is all distributed from the Hongkou area, and the main counterfeit center is also located within the Hongkou area. Those in charge include Japanese and Taiwanese. After the counterfeit currency is printed, it is packed into boxes and shipped out of Hongkou, where attempts are made to mix it into circulation. Therefore, the quantity flowing out is undoubtedly very large. This move by the Japanese is actually an attempt to disrupt our country's finances and suppress people's faith in legal tender. Concession authorities are now strictly suppressing it.

### Business as Trademark, Trademark Ambiguity, If Another Person's Business Name Is Not Registered, There Is No Right to Request Cancellation

The Executive Yuan previously issued an instruction to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to forward to the Trademark Bureau for review regarding an ambiguity arising from a provision in the Trademark Law restricting the use of another person's business name as a trademark. The Ministry of Economic Affairs' order to the Trademark Bureau reads as follows: "Having received Executive Yuan Instruction No. 8404 of October 17, 27th year of the Republic, stating: 'This Yuan previously encountered an ambiguity in the application of Article 2, Paragraph 8 of the Trademark Law, and requested an interpretation from the Judicial Yuan. Now, with the approval of Judicial Yuan Instruction No. 1789 of October 4, 27th year of the Judicial Yuan, stating: "It has been resolved by the Unified Interpretation of Laws Conference of this Yuan that the provision in Article 2, Paragraph 8 of the Trademark Law, requiring the consent of another person when applying to register their business name as a trademark, is established to protect the rights and interests of that other person. If the other person's business name is not registered according to law, a rights relationship does not arise, and consent is not required to use it as a trademark for registration. The other person has no right to request cancellation. Correspondingly, a consultation is made for your information." 'Approved. It is fitting to copy and issue the original instruction from this Yuan for your information. This order.'" And so, a copy of the original consultation from this Yuan was forwarded to the Ministry. It is fitting to copy and issue the Executive Yuan's consultation for your information. This order.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Disposition, Surplus from Rice Sales, Surplus of 280,000 Yuan, All Allocated as Relief Funds

The Joint Rice and Grain Management Committee organized by the authorities of the two concessions recently held a meeting to discuss the food supply for residents of the city. The estimated total rice reserves in the city are approximately 900,000 piculs. The average daily arrival of new goods this year is approximately 10,000 piculs. The estimated reserves in the French Concession are 96,000 bags, an increase of 30,000 bags in December of last year and January of this year. Although rice from the countryside is being purchased and transported from all northern ports, the city's supply remains stable, so there is no fear of a shortage of food. According to reports received by the committee, the Municipal Council had originally stored 10,606 bags of rice, some of which had shown signs of mold and had been sold earlier. There are currently 6,156 bags remaining. The Chief Financial Officer of the Municipal Council, in view of the current rice supply, believes that the Bureau need not hoard rice and intends to sell all of it. The Joint Management Committee approved the proposed action. The Chief Financial Officer's report stated that a total of 22,740 tons of foreign rice had been purchased by the Municipal Council, and after offsetting income and expenses, there would be a net surplus of approximately 280,000 yuan in national currency. In addition, there is another 54,000 yuan, which is the amount paid by some importers. These importers, after the Municipal Council decided to stop purchasing foreign rice, transported it themselves, and the Bureau provided facilitation and charged fees accordingly. The total amount is as stated above. Regarding the disposal of these two sums of money, the Chief Financial Officer has put forward suggestions. The first suggestion is to allocate the 54,000 yuan paid by the importers as direct relief funds for refugees to supplement the shortage of entertainment tax revenue. The second suggestion is to include the surplus of 280,000 yuan from the sale of rice in the Bureau's general budget to offset the refugee relief expenses that the Bureau has already spent and is continuing to spend (such as the operating expenses of refugee shelters and hospitals, as well as police expenses, etc.). Both suggestions were unanimously approved by the Joint Management Committee and approved by the Municipal Council's Board of Directors. The refugee relief expenses of various departments of the Bureau will deduct the aforementioned surplus amount. Many Municipal Council staff members have put in a lot of effort in the Bureau's regulation of the food supply. The Chief Financial Officer has been particularly enthusiastic about this public welfare undertaking. The Bureau's Board of Directors and the Rice and Grain Joint Management Committee express their deep gratitude.

### Japanese Attempt to Censor Films, Attempt to Control Films Fails, Now Trying an Inspection System

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that, according to reliable sources today (the 17th), the Japanese Special Affairs Department in Central China is preparing to inspect all Chinese films starting from March 1st. It is rumored that the Japanese authorities want to follow the precedent of direct control of the film industry by the Central Propaganda Department and are currently negotiating with Chinese film companies to restore the inspection system. According to the current plan of the Japanese side, all films, before production, must have their scripts reviewed by the Japanese side, and after filming, they will be reviewed again. It is rumored that the Japanese side's plan to organize a film industry trust controlled by them has failed. They then planned to establish an inspection system. The Japanese side had previously attempted to obtain the support of several major film companies in order to merge with Japanese capital to establish and operate under their control the North China and Manchukuo Film Companies. They sent people to negotiate with the Star Film Company. After the company's authorities firmly refused, the Fenglin Bridge studio across the road from Qiqilu caught fire and suffered some losses. Therefore, personnel from the Japanese Special Affairs Department are now taking this new approach, hoping to control the Chinese film industry through inspection. Films that have not been inspected will not be allowed to be shown in the guerrilla areas in order to reduce film revenue. Some cinemas in the guerrilla areas have resumed business, showing old Chinese and foreign films distributed by pro-Japanese Chinese organizations. The Japanese side does not inspect these films.

### Chamber of Commerce Informs Zhongyuan Company to Affix Stamp Duty According to Law

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has reported that the Shanghai Zhongyuan Company at No. 83 Zhili Road still affixes a stamp with a mark indicating that the post office has stopped selling stamps for invoices, but does not affix the stamp duty according to law. It is specifically advised that stamp duty stamps are now sold by various industry associations and major tobacco and paper shops. The so-called inability to affix the stamp is a situation from before September of last year. This is no longer the case now. It is hoped that the stamps will be purchased and affixed promptly in the future to fulfill the obligations of a citizen.

### Qualifications of Committee Members of Trade Associations, Interpretation of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Those Who Lose Qualifications Should Still Be Removed, Resignation Due to Circumstances Should Not Be Approved

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to various trade associations yesterday regarding the issue of qualifications of committee members of trade associations during extraordinary times, stating: "To the Directors, on December 6th of last year, a letter was received from the Shanghai Knitting Industry Association, stating: "The term of office of our association's committee members has long expired, but due to the extraordinary times and legal restrictions, it is impossible to hold a re-election. Furthermore, some executive and supervisory committee members have factories that have ceased operations and have left the industry, and some who were originally representatives of Factory A have become representatives of Factory B. According to Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 1162 of December 19, 23rd year of the Republic, they should all lose their qualifications as committee members and have not attended meetings, resulting in a lack of quorum for our association's standing committee members, making it impossible to convene meetings and elect replacements according to regulations. Important matters cannot be discussed and carried out. May we remove the committee members who have lost their qualifications, calculate the number of people, so that we can convene meetings according to law and promote association affairs. This is the first point that requires clarification. Furthermore, regarding item 3 above, whether Wang Huaying's repeated resignations should be approved during this extraordinary period. This is the second point that requires clarification. In addition, all of our association's alternate committee members have been filled. This is stated in combination,' etc. To the association, it was considered that the Temporary Measures for Maintaining the Status Quo of Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Organizations During Extraordinary Times, Article 2, 'The holding of members' congresses and the re-election of officers shall be postponed,' refers to the postponement of members' congresses and the postponement of the re-election of executive and supervisory committee members whose terms have expired. The convening of meetings of the executive committee and supervisory committee, and the filling of vacancies on the standing committee by the executive committee, are not restricted by the above-mentioned temporary measures. Although the second half of Article 2 stipulates that 'during the postponement period, the original officers shall not be relieved of their responsibilities,' this refers to the original officers whose terms of office have expired and have not lost their qualifications as members' representatives. If the qualifications as members' representatives have already been lost, they are not included in the so-called 'shall not be relieved of their responsibilities' in Article 2. At this time, if there are alternate committee members who can fill the vacancies, there is no difficulty. However, due to the lack of a quorum, the executive committee cannot be convened. The only solution is to temporarily leave the standing committee vacancies unfilled. Which of these is more appropriate? We respectfully request the approval of your ministry for review and guidance, so that we may comply. Furthermore, according to Article 2 of the Temporary Measures, 'The original officers shall not be relieved of their responsibilities,' executive and supervisory committee members should not resign at this time. However, if it is impossible to force them to attend meetings and perform their duties in reality, should we temporarily suspend the matter or are there other remedial measures? We also request your instructions for compliance, as this is in the public interest,' etc. After submitting a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review and guidance, we received a reply from the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the 16th of this month, with the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Commercial Letter No. 20704 stating: 'Received the report. It has been found that during the period of maintaining the status quo, if an incumbent committee member of a chamber of commerce loses their qualifications as a representative, they should still be removed. Resignations due to circumstances should not be approved. If it is impossible to force them to attend meetings, the matter should be temporarily suspended. As for the convening of executive committee meetings, it is not necessary to be bound by Article 20 of the Regulations for the Implementation of the Chamber of Commerce Law during the period of maintaining the status quo. Please inform accordingly.' etc. It has been found that Article 20 of the Regulations for the Implementation of the Chamber of Commerce Law states that when the executive committee meets, a majority of the committee members must be present. Now, with the ministry's approval, the previous article can be waived during extraordinary times to remedy the insufficient number of people. If various associations have similar situations, they should all follow this procedure uniformly. A special letter is issued to inform you, hoping that you will take note and comply."

### Families of Two Puppets Claim Corpses, Special Second Court Prosecutor Examines, All Remaining Items Returned Together

Tu Fu, the pseudo "President of the Shanghai Local Court," also known as lawyer Tu Zhenhu, and Gao Hongzao, a pseudo "Shanghai Police Bureau Water Patrol Team Member," were shot and fatally wounded in the concession the other day, inside the Tianxiang Lane on Route du Père Froc, and at the entrance of Quanyuli on Route Hennequin respectively, dying on the spot. The French concession police transported the two bodies to the autopsy room of the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Route Talas for examination. All details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police department of the French concession reported to the Special Second Court Prosecutor's Office, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren, accompanied by forensic medical clerks, to conduct an examination at noon. Rising to the official case, an investigator reported on the investigation after the incident, and the body of Tu Qisen, the son of the deceased, and Gao Zhou, the wife of the deceased, filed a case, requesting to claim the bodies for burial. The official examined and found that Tu Zhenhu and Gao Hongzao died from gunshot wounds. The bodies were handed over to the son and wife of the deceased, who each signed a guarantee to claim the bodies for burial, and the police department handled the case. The personal belongings of the deceased were handed over to the families of the deceased.

The North-China Daily News reports that Tu Zhenhu, the pseudo-President of the Nanshi Local Court, was assassinated yesterday (the 16th) morning on Route du Père Froc. According to what could be confirmed last night, the police department of the French Concession found several bullet casings at the scene, and obtained a clue, determining that the handgun used to assassinate Tu was the same gun used to kill the Japanese Kano on Route Robert last July 7th. The Japanese was an employee of a Japanese yarn factory who was riding a bicycle to work when he was killed on Route Robert. Furthermore, the pseudo water police Gao Hongzao was also shot and killed on Route Hennequin yesterday morning. Experts then examined the bullet casings found at the scene and discovered that the gun had also been used in many shootings on July 7th of last year.

### Long-Term Lover Disgusted, Malicious Abandonment Accused, Lived Together for Nine Years and Had a Daughter, Incited Legal Wife to Go and Make Trouble

### A Hand Grenade Was Thrown into a Hollywood Gambling Den, Gamblers Are Terrified and Keep It Secret Afterward

The Hollywood gambling den on Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai has been open for many months. Because gamblers flock to it, it has made a huge profit of hundreds of thousands. Recently, the den was suddenly attacked with a grenade, but it did not explode. Afterwards, the den kept it a secret, so few outsiders knew about it. It has been learned that at 3:30 PM on the 12th of this month, two men wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers, each riding a bicycle, were passing by the entrance of the den when the one in front suddenly threw a paper package inside. The one in the back lingered slightly and loudly told the doorman that there was a warning letter inside and that a clear reply must be given the next day, or they would be treated with a bomb. The den opened the package and found a hand grenade and a warning letter. Afterwards, the den prohibited revealing the news, fearing that it would affect business. However, the result was that it was leaked by someone in the den. (News from She Wen She)

### Pawnshop Deliberately Receives Stolen Goods, Sentenced to Imprisonment

The Mingxing Pawnshop at No. 512 Tianjin Road previously received stolen goods from various major companies from thieves such as Weng Kaican almost every day, and sometimes did not even issue pawn tickets. Later, Weng et al. were arrested by Chinese detectives Han Shoushan and Li Jincheng of the General Patrol Room. When they went to the pawnshop to recover the stolen goods, the pawnshop took out all the items pawned by Weng et al. without waiting for the detectives to explain. Therefore, the patrol room determined that the pawnshop knew that the items pawned by Weng et al. were stolen when they received them. Knowing that they were stolen goods, they deliberately received them, violating the criminal law. Therefore, patrol room lawyer Zhang Shizhu filed a public prosecution against the Cantonese owner of the pawnshop, Weng Liufu, for the crime of receiving stolen goods under Article 349 of the Criminal Law. After being summoned once, Judge Fang Qinghuan opened the court for continued questioning yesterday. The patrol room also submitted a proposal from Weng Kaican et al., stating that the pawnshop gave larger pawn amounts than other pawnshops, and that when they went there, the pawnshop often did not issue pawn tickets. After deliberation, Judge Fang announced the verdict, fining Weng Liufu 300 yuan for receiving stolen goods as a warning.

### Xiao Wenbin and His Wife Are Not Divorced

Xiao Wenbin and Xiao Yuezhen, a famous Shen Opera couple, have always been on good terms since their marriage.

They expressed great surprise at the rumors and said that since they started performing Shen Opera, they had never offended anyone. The sudden appearance of this rumor, possibly spread by someone stirring up trouble with the intention of sabotaging their reputation, and the involvement of Lu Laoqi, must have some ulterior motive.

### Letter

To the Editor: I recently read a news article in your newspaper about the pitiful life of Fang Lili, which mentioned that attorney Feng Meixue was specially hired to defend against the crime of leaving the family and to sue Jiang Yongnian in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. After investigation, our firm has not represented Fang Lili and Wang Gengsheng in filing a lawsuit against the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. I believe this is a misunderstanding of the reporter's hearsay. Please correct this in your newspaper to avoid spreading misinformation. Yours sincerely, Attorney Feng Meixue, February 17, 28.

### Current Status of the Liaison Office for the Staff of the Two Railways: Request to Temporarily Close the Savings Account, Still Dedicated to Relief Efforts

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the staff of the Jin-Hu-Hang-Yong and other two railways were soon evacuated. Because the accumulated savings over the years are quite large, in May of last year, representatives of the office requested the return of a portion, totaling 300,000 yuan in national currency. At the end of last year, another 200,000 yuan in deposits matured. The office made a second request, which has also been approved by the authorities remaining in Shanghai for phased borrowing. After this, there will be no more funds available for borrowing regarding the savings issue, so it must be temporarily suspended. Therefore, starting from March 1st, the office will devote itself to various relief efforts, such as sending poor workers to shelters, introducing children to education, and running its own clinic. Dr. Gu Puquan, originally invited from the railway, is responsible for medical services. Others, such as dentist Shao Weichen, Chinese medicine practitioner Ma Xiaoqin, and ophthalmologist Ms. Zhu Peiyu, have successively provided voluntary medical treatment to colleagues on the two railways. Communication matters are also being diligently promoted to prevent the colleagues on the two railways from being isolated from news. However, it is heard that the representatives of the office, due to their own business relations, are still united and voluntarily dedicated to relief efforts for all colleagues, which is truly commendable.

### Submitted Article: My Opinion on the Dispute between Tenants and Subtenants - Attorney Ying Shi

Since the Shanghai War began, the population of both concessions has increased due to the influx of people from all over, causing overcrowding and a shortage of housing. Landlords have benefited doubly from this disaster, earning profits several times over. However, while tenants bear a heavy burden, they can share it with subtenants through subletting, which is not absolutely inappropriate in terms of law and morality. However, the quality of tenants varies, just as it does with landlords, and cannot be generalized. Currently, there are roughly three types of tenants who sublet their houses to subtenants. The first type sublets a portion of the house, sharing the original rent proportionally, merely reducing their own burden. The second type transfers the entire original rent to the subtenant, living for free themselves. The third type not only lives for free but also sublets the house at a higher price, earning tens or hundreds of yuan in addition to paying the original rent, taking advantage of the situation to the fullest extent. Their ruthlessness is infuriating. Thus, in addition to landlords hoarding houses, a more serious problem has formed, which those who care about people's livelihood are worried about but cannot solve. I believe that the way to remedy this is for the competent administrative authorities, in addition to legal means, to use administrative measures to require landlords of all houses within the concession, whether shops or residences, to report the amount of rent they are leasing. At the same time, they should agree with the tenants that if the total rent of the sublet exceeds the original rent, the landlord has the right to terminate the contract. In this way, the subtenant will not be able to sublet the house, and the tenant will at most be able to live for free, and will definitely not be able to profit from it like the third type mentioned above. Subtenants will not be exploited. At the same time, the court should immediately approve the landlord's request to terminate the lease contract if the rent received by the tenant from subletting exceeds the original rent. This would achieve multiple objectives at once, be easy to implement, and truly benefit society. This is my humble opinion, but I don't know if it is appropriate.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: Shandong and its surrounding areas will be cloudy with snow and will turn to clouds, and there will be fog, with westerly to northerly winds. The East China Sea will be cloudy with rain or fog, with cyclones moving northeast-east due to low pressure. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 50.5, the lowest was 38.5. On the same day last year, the highest was 44.6, and the lowest was 28.4.

### Participating in the "One-Day Disaster Relief Movement"

— Mao Lie

Residents of the isolated island, for various reasons, in my opinion, besides donating money to the government, the biggest contribution to the nation is actively relieving refugees.

I have said before that the creation of refugees is by no means their own fault. You and I could have been refugees. And relieving refugees is by no means out of charity or hope for good rewards. It is indeed the responsibility that everyone should bear in this stage of nationwide resistance against the enemy. Not many days ago, there was a movement in the Shanghai education sector to raise "Refugee Production Education Funds." Now there is also a "One-Day Disaster Relief Movement" for Shanghai citizens. One after another, it can be said that everyone really knows the current need and is starting to work on it.

The initiators of these two movements are truly admirable. However, for any movement, especially these two, to succeed, it is always necessary to obtain the support and practical participation of the public. I don't know what the public's response has been since the launch of these two movements, but I always hope that the public will not forget their responsibilities and will be generous in donating and actively contributing.

For the Refugee Production Education Fund, an average donation of one yuan per student is enough. For a one-day disaster relief, a donation of one day's income for each citizen is enough. If such an easy good deed, which is also a significant patriotic act, still does not receive everyone's participation, then, Lao Bao said, the demise of the nation need not wait for the invasion of foreign tribes!

These two movements are starting at the end of this old lunar year, indeed finding the best opportunity, and it can be said that they are giving us the most appropriate time. As shown in "Yi Yan," it does not require us to dig out some more from our own meager assets, but hopes that we will save some from various wastes. Can't we save some!

If we talk about good rewards, then everyone can know that the good reward of disaster relief is far above seeking gods and worshiping Buddha. Because saving a refugee is to preserve a bit of vitality for the country, which is also to increase a bit of strength in the resistance against the enemy. In the future, when the country is an independent and free country, and the people are prosperous and wealthy, you will have a share. Isn't this a big reward!

### Walled Villages

— Qin Wen

In the past, in Chengdu, I often found it difficult to visit friends. I could clearly find the street and confirm the house number, but it didn't seem right at all. If it was a famous person's residence, one would never expect it to be a small grocery store selling oil and wine. Looking at the dirty and dark shop, I always thought I had mistaken the street name or house number. Only after confirming that it was correct did I feel truly baffled. After winding through many narrow and long alleys, and passing through unexpectedly beautiful gardens, I would finally reach the high-rise Western-style living room with a nanmu wood floor, so slippery it felt like a dance hall. It turned out that to prevent "enlightenment" – to avoid being looted by defeated soldiers – the residences of wealthy families were usually disguised unless they had soldiers to guard them, because Sichuan in the past was the province with the most civil wars.

In southern Fujian, I often saw gun towers, far more numerous than ordinary pillboxes. On the way from Jimei School Village to the county town of Tong'an, every time I approached a village, I would see the gun towers from afar. Where two villages were connected, there would be two gun towers facing each other. Large villages had gun towers around them, and large manor houses also had their own gun towers. A village could have as many as five or more gun towers, arming the villages of southern Fujian to defend against bandit raids and prepare for guard during armed clashes.

The other day, I visited Jishan, one of the scenic spots of the new provincial capital of Fujian, where I saw a type of armed manor house called a walled village. In the past, Yong'an belonged to Fuliu Division of Sha County, which was always plagued by bandits. It was not until the Jingtai period of the Ming Dynasty that it was established as a county, named Yong'an, because the pacification of bandits and the hope for "eternal peace" reflected the fact that it was "originally not peaceful." Walled villages, both upper and lower Jishan, were built more ingeniously than gun towers. Thick walls were built around ten rooms in a row and two courtyards, made of pebbles and earth, almost half as thick as ordinary city walls. On top of the walls, another wall was built on the outer side, with many holes for shooting guns, and windows that could be opened and closed. The outer ring of the upper-level walls was supported by pillars to create a roof. In this way, the top of the lower-level walls became a kind of "floor," with walkways all around, hence the name walled village. The doors to the outside were sturdy and small, with protruding corners on the walls that were easy to defend. At the first sign of bandits, one would grab a gun and go up to the walled village. If bandits broke in, one could certainly kill them one by one. In fact, even approaching was difficult, because one could be shot from all directions. It is said that sophisticated walled villages had secret underground passages to other places, so even if a large army came to besiege, one could resist for a while and then escape far away.

As a result of conscription, various places in central Fujian have gradually become peaceful. In western and northern Fujian, where mountains overlap and guerilla warfare is easy, there is no need for these walled villages to defend against foreign invaders. In Yong'an, walled villages will only become relics of the past. But this can serve as a reference for the defense of lost territories: it is said that in villages near cities occupied by invaders, rapes and looting often occur. If such walled villages were built everywhere to help each other, there would be no need to fear small-scale disturbances by invaders. Killing them one by one, so that none could return alive, wouldn't that be a delightful thing?

The Beiling Palace, the Wenchang Pavilion, and Jishan also have many places with elegant scenery. But I think the most noteworthy is the walled village, because using this method can inflict significant blows on the attackers!

### Illiteracy

— Geng Zhi

There is a very old joke that says someone was holding a book and reading it attentively. Someone walked up to him and saw that he was holding the book upside down. When confronted, he calmly said, "I'm showing it to you."

It seems that jokes are always jokes, and there may not be such people in the world who are illiterate but pretend to be literate. Even emperors have been illiterate, and if one is illiterate, one is illiterate. Why pretend to be literate? However, literacy can be used to feign elegance, and books, built up one word at a time, also have their wonderful uses: "In books, there are houses of gold; in books, there are faces of jade; in books, there are thousands of bushels of grain." Who wouldn't envy that? Therefore, the illiterate want to pretend to be literate, and even pretend to be able to read books and write books. If you don't believe me, I can give you a few examples:

A certain celebrity went abroad to travel and returned after a few months, vigorously promoting a certain system, saying that he had read over two thousand reference books about this system in various countries. Someone calculated for him, wondering how he could read one or two hundred books a day. However, some people didn't doubt it, and simply concluded that he was lying because he didn't know those foreign words at all.

After a certain wealthy young man returned from studying abroad, his study was filled with books from various countries, gleaming with gold and splendor. Whoever walked in was impressed by his erudition. However, the copyright pages of those books were mostly printed with "191-" or "192-", and even "189-". People who knew the inside story said that he bought these books by the ton from foreign junk shops, and he didn't know those foreign words at all.

A certain scholar couldn't recognize ABCD, but could translate books from various European and American countries; a certain scholar couldn't read "ai yi wu a weng," but could also translate Japanese books, and both translated a lot. There is no secret here. He just paid someone else to translate them and put his own name on them.

However, the above are all about not knowing foreign words. Although pretending, the situation is still excusable, because foreign words are difficult after all. And the Western trick is easy to be exposed, so it sounds ordinary and unremarkable. It is only when a native doesn't know the native language and pretends to be able to compose poems, write articles, and write books that it becomes strange.

A certain member of the Qing Dynasty royal family in the former Qing dynasty was illiterate but liked to compose poems. When he returned to Beijing from Hubei, someone held a banquet to send him off, and he improvised a poem: "Riding a horse to Huguang, the people of Tan Guang look down on me. One day I will go to my Beijing, where doesn't one meet in life?" Others deliberately praised him, and he repeatedly humbly said, "It's just rhyming; just rhyming."

Another member of the former Qing Dynasty royal family became a censor and wanted to show something, so he asked someone to write a memorial for him, asking the emperor to appoint Huang Tianba to quell the bandit rebellion. Needless to say, he didn't know even a single character of it.

Perhaps you will say that this was the corruption of the former Qing dynasty, and it may not be the case now. Then, let's talk less about the former Qing dynasty and talk about the present. Would you believe that there are several bookstore owners who are illiterate? But they are very powerful and can publish books, all kinds of books, and they publish a lot, and the sales are quite considerable. Of course, I have proof. But I'm not trying to reveal people's secrets, and because they are bosses and I am a literary beggar, they can order me around, so I don't look down on them even more. I'm just using them as an argument for my thesis.

Seeing this situation, some people say that Shakespeare was just an illiterate actor, and the magnificent masterpieces, plays, were all written by Bacon. This seems to have credible reasons. And seeing this situation, it is enough to make people feel that there is no need to be literate. However, I want to honestly tell you that illiteracy is not a good thing after all, and there is another old joke as proof:

A country person who claimed to be literate. One day, his in-law sent someone to bring a note. In front of other guests, he looked at the note and immediately said, "I'll come; I'll come." In fact, the note asked to borrow an ox, and he didn't need to go in person.

An illiterate pretender to be an expert wants to be an ox. Why bother—

### Candlelight

— A Cheng

I struck a match and lit the stub of a candle that I had bought with the few cents left in my pocket. Thus, the faint light kissed the broken tabletop in the dark corner of the room again.

I spread the yellowed piece of paper on the table, picked up my pen, and looked up. I thought, I pondered, I racked my brains, but I couldn't write a single word... Suddenly, I saw the candlelight gradually expand, grow bigger, big enough to look like a sow, like an ox... even bigger to look like a stage for a play, showing: the scene of an old mother spinning a wheel by the dim candlelight on a winter night, the magnificent scene of an older brother stripping to the waist and husking rice by the dim candlelight on an autumn night... But in an instant, these beautiful scenes were all erased by an intruding demon hand...

Suddenly, my eyes were blurred with tears. I quickly pulled out the already blackened white handkerchief and wiped away the tears.

When I looked again, there was nothing left, only the pure white candle standing on the table, shedding tears silently with me. There was nothing left, only the dim, swaying candlelight, accompanying my lonely and also swaying heart.

### Difficult Pass

A medium-length novel

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

5 Defending the Homeland

Such a desperate defense obviously had some emotional component, at least the mentality that sacrificing for the country was the supreme glory. In fact, from a rational point of view, it was very unreasonable, so even Zhao Desheng, the battalion commander who had always been the bravest in combat, could not help but protest to Commander Ye:

"Reporting to Commander, our troops are already surrounded by the enemy on three sides. If we don't retreat, the entire army will be wiped out."

"Don't say anything more, quickly go and direct the brothers to fight. This is our last position. Today, we will die without retreating," Commander Ye said in a firm tone, completely losing his usual gentleness.

But Battalion Commander Zhao also refused to back down.

"May I ask Commander, what is the meaning of such a desperate defense? What damage can it inflict on the enemy?"

"Don't you know about Commander Xie of the 88th Division defending the Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei?" Commander Ye said, his eyes bulging out. "They were a regiment of men, and we are also a regiment of men. They can make the Sihang Warehouse their last position, and we should make this defense line our last position. To be wrapped in horsehide is originally the duty of our soldiers."

"But our situation is somewhat different from Commander Xie's. Shanghai is, after all, a place of international attention, unlike our isolated position here. Moreover, Commander Xie eventually obeyed Chairman Chiang's order and withdrew from the Sihang Warehouse. It can be seen that in a long-term war of resistance, preserving strength is more meaningful than making a heroic sacrifice." (16)

Entertainment World

### A Rational Entertainment for the New Year

— Qing Na

National Salvation Contribution Competition

Undoubtedly, entertainment is not only sufficient to relieve boredom and regulate the mind and body, but also can improve work efficiency. We do not sing the high-pitched tune of "no entertainment during the national crisis," because in the current stage of isolated islands, it is impossible for the general public not to entertain. Therefore, we advocate not abolishing entertainment, but in this difficult period, all entertainment must be advanced under the principle of "not wasting money but benefiting the country and society." Only in this way does it have value and meaning can it be called rationalized entertainment. In this old twenty-eighth year, citizens all over Shanghai, before engaging in various entertainment activities, may wish to try a rationalized suggestion for the following. This was promoted by Dr. L.S. Wehb since his stay in this country, deeply welcomed by the youth of various universities in Shanghai. To this end, it is hoped that various groups or friends on the isolated island can promote this more often during gatherings or after-dinner entertainment, because it is much stronger than general low-level entertainment!

This entertainment requires a minimum gathering of four or five people, or six or seven people. The more people, the more interesting. Everyone sits in a circle, and one person is selected as the issuer and commander, standing in the center of the circle, holding a golden gong or a small drum. When the competition starts, the issuer hands a round stick or a ball (other objects can also be used) to the first person to raise it high, and then immediately sounds the gong or drum. Everyone immediately passes the stick or ball in their hand to others in accordance with the sound of the gong. The faster the drumbeat, the faster the passing also. The transfer is rapid, continuous, and each stops quickly. At this time, the person in whose hand there is a stick or ball must be fined. After a short pause, the second competition begins. After one or two hours, the amount of the fine will inevitably be considerable. Then, representatives are elected by everyone to send the funds to the bank for transfer to the government. According to our dozens of competition experiences, we know that this entertainment has excellent results, and even everyone cheers for the person with the most fines. Also, if this entertainment is held in the evening, and the object of transfer is changed to a torch (referring to competitions held in open spaces), then it can not only enhance everyone's emotions, but also have a very good symbolic meaning of brightness?

### Gods and Monsters in Plays

— Li A Mao

There is an old saying in theater troupes, "If the play isn't enough, gods and immortals make it up." It can be seen that Chinese playwrights have always resorted to bringing out gods and immortals to pad out the play when they have no other choice, so these gods, ghosts, monsters, and the like also occupy a part of the position in the play.

Recently, many people have opposed these kinds of things, thinking that they are promoting superstition, especially against movies. I feel that promoting superstition should certainly be prohibited; but gods, ghosts, and monsters are not necessarily superstition. First, it depends on the content of the plot, whether there is a possibility of leading people into superstition? Taking the novels Journey to the West and Investiture of the Gods as examples, it is clear that people who read Journey to the West and Investiture of the Gods just look at his nonsense, and will never become superstitious about gods and Buddhas because of reading Journey to the West and Investiture of the Gods. Although there are young and ignorant people who leave home and enter the mountains to learn martial arts after reading martial arts novels, it is not so easy to become superstitious after reading novels and dramas about gods and monsters. Churches use all their energy to persuade people to believe in the Way, but it is very difficult to get a new believer.

From this point of view, the gods and monsters in dramas cannot be generalized and determined to be superstitious, because gods and monsters do not necessarily have superstitious materials. The amount of superstitious material is the real main cause of leading people into superstition.

If, regardless of the nature, all dramas with gods and monsters are to be prohibited, then there are also several difficult problems. For example, for foreign religious dramas such as "The Ten Commandments" and "The King of Kings," should they also be regarded as superstition and prohibited? There are also many gods in children's fairy tale dramas, which are considered important materials in education, and children all know that this is false, and no one has ever deeply believed that this is true. Then, should fairy tales, which occupy an important position in education, also be abolished?

Three or four years ago, I wrote a script to break superstition, but the characters in this script were all gods and monsters, depicting the corruption of gods and monsters, making them lose people's respect. But some people also objected. So, it can be seen that the main reason for opposition is not superstition, but gods and monsters.

### New News about Spoken Drama

Shanghai Drama Art Society The "Poppy Flower" to be premiered by the Shanghai Drama Art Society at the French Municipal Council Auditorium on Huanlong Road starting from the 19th is a new type of song and dance drama, directed by the famous dance expert Wu Xiaobang, and composed and musically directed by Chen Gexin. The plot of the play is: —— In a beautiful pastoral area, farmers sow seeds up and down the hillside, and brilliant flowers bloom everywhere on the earth. The farmers and farm women happily sing planting songs, and the farm women also dance. A storm rises, and shameless people on the earth, lovers and operators of poppies, come out to find land to plant themselves, smelling here and there, dancing strange and rare dances of human inquiry. These shameless people report that the poppy has eradicated the flowers on the slope and sown poppies that poison the world. The farmers then cry, but this group of villains hates the sound of crying, finds many farmers to torture, and the earth is darkened. Under the groans, the farm women secretly look for their companions. They sing "Love of the Earth", awakening the fainting farmers. The farm women help them to rest, and new strength grows during the rest. They begin to plant this beautiful pastoral area again. New forces are growing on the earth. The poppy and its followers encounter unexpected resistance on the earth, which is a new force of resistance. The farm women sing victory songs. The children of the earth have won, and the earth celebrates them. They and she dance around the withered poppies with laughter of peace and freedom——dancing.

Yilin Drama Society The Yilin Drama Society's Yilin Sunday Theatre has been performed at the Carlton Grand Theatre for many times, and has received unanimous praise from the critics. Now, in order to repay the audience, it does not hesitate to sacrifice and arrange two famous historical costume dramas in full, directed by the famous director Wang Cilong, "Killing the Family" and "Wulongyuan", which will be staged at one time, and will be presented at the Carlton on the first, second and third mornings of the Lunar New Year at 10:00 am. The seat price remains the same, four corners for all. On the fourth and fifth days of the Lunar New Year, due to the letters received from all walks of life, the famous play Liu Sanye, etc. will be replayed, and a famous band will be specially invited to play wonderful music in each scene. It is really a triple win, and it is the best place for spoken drama audiences to go on New Year's Day.

Xueying Drama Society The Xueying Drama Society is organized by amateur young people who love spoken drama. Now, in order to learn acting, gain stage experience, and ask for advice from all walks of life, it is scheduled to perform "Thunderstorm" at the sixth floor of the Pudong Native Place Association on February 19, with two performances day and night. The lineup is as follows: director Lu Si, actors Zhou Puyuan, Lie Zhe, Lu Gui, Sun Ying, Fanyi, Chen Ying, Lu Yan, Ling Xiao, Zhou Ping, Qiu Zhi, Lu Dahai, Li Desheng, Zhou Chong Tang Chong, Sifeng, Xiao Lin.

### Hong Kong Drama News

— Man Fu

Lin Shusen uses the War of Resistance as a Banner

Yesterday, I received a letter from a friend in Hong Kong, reporting news about folk dramas, saying that Lin Shusen had arrived in Hong Kong and would take the stage at the Lee Theatre on the Lunar New Year's Day. The backbone of the Lin Drama Troupe is Kun Dan Wang Yaoqin, martial arts students Wang Xiaofang Wang Shaofang Yan Haoming, Xiaosheng Bi Chunfang, and painted face Wang Fusheng, etc. The highest seat price is HK$1.50, which is close to three yuan when converted into Shanghai currency. The Lee Theatre published an advertisement in the newspaper, with a casual photo of Lin Shusen attached, calling him "a well-known and powerful red student." The wording of the advertisement is also novel, using "War of Resistance" as a banner and "Guan Yunchang" as a slogan, saying: "Lin Shusen and his troupe members are invited by the owner of the Lee Theatre, and arrived in Hong Kong today on the Russian Empress. They will perform his life's fierce dramas at the Lee Theatre in the New Year. All the troupe members are working hard to shoot and perform. Mr. Lin is good at performing Guan Gong dramas. Then, Yunchang's bravery in those years will be seen again today in the all-out War of Resistance. This is also the purpose of entertaining without forgetting to save the country"! Among them, the words "fierce drama" and "working hard to shoot and perform" are completely the writing style of "Cantonese opera" advertisements.

The level of Hong Kong people watching dramas is not very high. They like to watch martial arts dramas with a lot of fighting. They are not easy to understand the lyrics and dialogues in Peking opera. The historical deeds of Guan Gong are well known to women and children. A short-term performance should not be too bad. What's more, their slogans are "entertaining without forgetting to save the country" and "Yunchang's bravery in those years will be seen again today in the all-out War of Resistance"!

Following Lin Shusen's rear team, he has invited Kun Jiao Hua Dan Jin Suqin, who will come to Hong Kong soon. Zhang Eyun has long been rumored to come to Hong Kong, but has not yet been realized. Some people say that with Zhang Eyun's reputation, and a complete team such as Yang Baosen, Ye Shenglan, and Ma Fulu, the box office will definitely be better than Lin Shusen. In Hong Kong's entertainment industry, the power of Cantonese films is the greatest, followed by Cantonese opera and spoken drama. As for Peking opera, it is not very developed, but it is only for the entertainment of the so-called "foreigners". Lin Shusen has been in Shanghai for a long time, and people are used to hearing and watching his red student dramas, so many people are worried about Lin Lao San!

A Sketch of the Dance World
— Xiao Tian

### Sketches of Dancers (II)

Entertainment is a necessary action to regulate life, but if entertainment does not include some research nature, those who are superior will inevitably be like chewing wax; those who are inferior will be addicted to lewdness and will never recover. Now let's put aside the others (ten) and focus on this topic. There are countless interesting things that can be studied in the dance world, such as dance skills, music, lighting configuration, decoration equipment, etc., which are not within the scope of this article's discussion. What this article wants to discuss is why are dancers popular? Why are they unpopular? Why should they be popular but unpopular? Why should they be unpopular but popular? If you don't mind being tedious, please listen to me:

Generally, when dance guests choose dance partners, they first look at their appearance. Those who are beautiful and have slender figures are danced with; those who have bright eyes and white teeth and are elegant and pleasant are danced with; those who have bright makeup and radiant appearance are danced with; when dancing together, they also choose those who have light bodies and move freely. If they are compatible, they will dance again and again until they have danced more than a dozen times. If they are not compatible, they will stop after one or two dances, and they will not be able to get long-term customers. As the number of guest dances increases, they will dance and talk. At first, they exchange pleasantries, and then they gradually become familiar. The scope of the conversation is also gradually widened. At this time, they should examine the guest's temperament and cater to his preferences, either calling him father, or calling him teacher, or elder brother or younger brother, depending on what he likes. They should be neither humble nor arrogant, neither close nor far, appropriately happy or angry, and sometimes true and sometimes false. The key lies in having appropriate responses, which are the three conditions for dancers to become popular. Those who get all of them will become very popular and earn thousands of gold per month; those who get two of them will become secondarily popular and earn five or six hundred gold per month; those who get one of them can also make a living.

The three conditions for dancers to become popular mentioned above, getting one of them is enough to make a living, but the so-called getting one of them, the other two must also be on the horizontal line. For example, appearance, beautiful and slender is the best, otherwise they must also have an average face. If they are ugly, fat, or swollen, they are bad, which is called violating the first condition, which is called the taboo of appearance. Although dance skills cannot be as light and free as desired, the steps must be neat. If the footwork is stiff, kicking the legs and bumping the feet, sticking out the chest and belly, this is called the taboo of dance skills. As for the skill of responding, the most taboo is to be cold and arrogant. When a guest speaks, they pretend to hear or not; when they speak to a guest, they seem to swallow or spit; they are obviously clear about their livelihood, but they insist on putting on a strong face; they obviously have no appointment, but they say they are busy with socializing; they obviously see the flower paper and are greedy, but they insist on pretending not to care, which is the biggest shortcoming! This summer, there was a variable (i.e., a changsan schoolgirl who turned into a dancer) who entered the Da Du Hui to dance. Her colleagues asked me to invite friends to support her. Several friends only danced one or two dances and then left. Three days later, she disappeared, and I have not met her in the dance hall since. A friend commented, "Her face is like a stepmother, and her feet are fighting each other. I knew she wouldn't be able to continue." Any dancer who commits one of the above taboos will have few long-term customers; those who commit two taboos will have few short-term customers; if they commit all three taboos and can maintain it for a month, it has never happened. The length of the article is already long, and I will talk about the two points of dancers who should be popular but unpopular and should be unpopular but popular in the next issue.

### Recommending "The Conqueror of Chu"

— A-Shan

Recently, at Yi Hua Film Company, under the guidance of Director Wang Cilong, I visited the projection room to preview "The Conqueror of Chu." The original film was fourteen reels long, totaling thirteen thousand feet. Now, after removing the superfluous and retaining the essential, it has become twelve reels, truly a rare mega-production among domestic films. Viewing the entire film, it is simply flawless. The director's techniques are superb, the handling is brilliant, and the plot is well-organized. Such a historical story is certainly not something a person of limited talent and knowledge would dare to attempt. The cast is well-rounded. Wang Yuanlong's acting is masterful, living up to his title as the "Overlord of the Silver Screen." The scenes of Consort Yu and the Wujiang River were as if the peerless hero of that era was reborn. After reading "The Ten Years of the Former Han," I think it's better to watch this film once. Jin Suqin as Consort Yu, Wen Yimin as Liu Bang, and Wang Naidong as Zhang Liang are all perfectly cast.

After the two-and-a-half-hour screening, I said to Director Wang, "This film is a success!" Mr. Wang smiled humbly and said, "You flatter me. However, if the environment and equipment were better in the future, perhaps even better works could be produced." Leaving Yi Hua, I was extremely excited and wrote this short article, sincerely recommending it to all film enthusiasts.

### Secret History of the Imperial Court and Pear Garden in the Former Capital (109)

— Xu Muyun

The Hobbies of Actors in Eating, Drinking, Gambling, and Playing with Birds, Beasts, Insects, and Fish. Jin Shaoshan can be considered a strange character in the acting world. Because he had no children, he kept a group of cats and dogs at home. The cats were divided into Beijing Lion Cats and various types of cats from Jiangnan. The dogs were divided into Western breeds and Chinese breeds. In addition, he also raised two monkeys. The old one had been raised for fifteen or sixteen years. He trained them to open and close doors, operate the mailbox, deliver letters, and even shake hands with regular guests, take their hats and hang them up. Except for not being able to speak, Shaoshan simply used them like maids. He smoked at night, and when everyone in the family was asleep, he had this animal by his side to pass him things, so it wasn't too lonely. However, as time went on, the monkey would lie on the lower part of the opium bed and smoke a pipe or two. After Shaoshan had his fill every day, he would have to burn a couple of puffs for it to enjoy. One day I went to Shaoshan's house and suddenly couldn't see it. I asked Shaoshan what was going on. After hearing my words, he didn't answer, but took me to the foot of the escalator, and pointed pitifully at the lead wire hanging on the pavilion door, saying: "The day before yesterday it rained heavily, almost non-stop all day. The stored food at home was not enough for me to use, so I only burned one puff for this animal to smoke. Who knew it was truly addicted to opium? When it encountered such a cloudy day, it couldn't bear it. It would jump on the bed and then jump off the ground. I didn't smoke enough myself, so naturally I didn't have the energy to take care of it. Who knew that it saw me just dozing off and not paying attention to it, so it climbed over to me and bit my left wrist. At that time, I was both surprised and pained, so I picked up the leather whip and whipped it wildly, giving it a beating. Afterwards, I was afraid that it would bite someone else, so I put it in this cage woven from lead wire, and I still have to give it opium to smoke every day."

### Finance: Hong Kong Banks Spare No Expense in Collecting Cash; Cash Reaches Unprecedented Peak, Rising to 2086 Yuan; Resulting in a Sharp Increase of 13 Yuan

Yesterday's spot market was sluggish, due to the upcoming Spring Festival holiday, the trade decided to close for six days starting yesterday. Few members attended the morning session, adhering to the agreement. However, Hong Kong banks maintained strong buying intentions, entrusting a certain gold firm and a certain jewelry store to collect cash on their behalf. However, most major long-term holders believed their holdings were rare commodities and were unwilling to sell. Additionally, the jewelry stores had already begun closing their books, so although the price was raised to 2080 yuan for purchase, sellers demanded 90 yuan above that, resulting in no transactions in the morning. (However, a certain money exchange business at the retail level did take in over a hundred taels, with the price rising from 78 yuan to 81 yuan.) In the afternoon, a few members began to enter the market to trade, but transactions were not active. As Hong Kong banks became more determined to buy, sparing no expense in their collection efforts, multiple holders were prompted to release their holdings at the high prices. First, a certain gold firm and money exchange sold 50 taels at 2084.5 yuan. Then, a certain jewelry store also bought 70 taels from Northern banks at the same price. Finally, a certain gold firm bought another 50 taels from money exchange businesses at 2086 yuan. As a result, the price rose another 13 yuan compared to the previous day, marking a total increase of 30 yuan over two consecutive days. Cash shops still operated normally, selling at 2095 yuan and buying at 2080 yuan. Current margin prices were about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold prices, but no transactions occurred.

Ornamental Gold Soars to 211 Yuan

The selling price of gold jewelry at jewelry stores per tael initially remained unchanged due to the lack of official market prices for spot gold. However, at 2:45 PM, due to news of Hong Kong banks' buying power driving spot gold to an unprecedented peak, the price of gold jewelry also reached a new high. Da Tong Hang, Lao Qingyun, and other major firms all listed prices at 211 yuan, while new firms listed at 209 yuan and bought back at 203 yuan. These prices represented an increase of one yuan compared to the previous day.

British Pure Gold Continues to Rise by Half a Penny

London, 16th: British pure gold continues to rise by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7 8s 4½d, leading to an increase in the Central Bank of China's cash buying price to 1211.3 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Settlements Flat in Tianjin; Foreign Exchange Once Tightens

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw banks favoring each other, assisting foreign commercial banks in Tianjin in settling transactions, and foreign firms also slightly settling foreign exchange. Foreign banks (except HSBC) showed little willingness to sell, but had a good appetite for buying, so even though telegrams from Hong Kong were flooding in, the overall position was still more bullish than bearish, leading to a potentially tight situation. Sterling fell to as low as 8 pence 1.09375, and the US dollar rose to as high as 15.8125 yuan. However, the situation was stabilized by HSBC and Chinese commercial banks competing to supply, resulting in sterling remaining flat and the US dollar slightly tightening. The Hong Kong dollar initially tightened as well, but later returned to flat as money exchange businesses increased their willingness to sell.

Early in the morning, the London swap rate continued to rise by 1.875, while the forward rate remained flat. New York silver prices also remained unchanged. London spot gold continued to rise by half a penny. The exchange rate of sterling against the US dollar fell by 6 points, against the French franc by a small amount of 5 centimes, and against Shanghai it was flat. The US dollar fell by 0.0625 against the pound, remained unchanged against the French franc, and fell by 10 cents against Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened with selling prices of 8 pence 1.125 for sterling and 15.84375 yuan for the US dollar, which were flat and slightly tighter than the previous close by 0.03125. After opening, Hong Kong Electric first sold sterling at 8 pence 1.125 and US dollars at 15.84375 yuan to Favorably Dutch, so the situation was quite flat. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax continued to rise by one cent, totaling 8.50%. After this, foreign exchange settlements became frequent, and foreign commercial banks' willingness to supply was quite weak, leading to sterling falling to as low as 8 pence 1.09375 and the US dollar rising to as high as 15.8125 yuan. Fortunately, HSBC's supply maintained the situation, turning it flat. Around noon, Huayi Anda bought Hong Kong dollars at 54.375 and 0.25 from money exchange businesses, so the potential situation was slightly tight. The afternoon closing prices for banks were 8 pence 1.125 for sterling and 15.84375 yuan for the US dollar. Later, Hua Bi sold sterling at 8 pence 1.125 to Dutch, and then a Chinese commercial bank speculator also sold US dollars at 15.875 yuan to a certain bank. Afterwards, money exchange businesses also sold Hong Kong dollars at 54.375 to Dutch, leading the process to return to flat. The evening closing prices for banks were 8 pence 1.125 for sterling and 15.84375 yuan for the US dollar, resulting in sterling remaining flat and the US dollar slightly tightening by 0.03125 compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar saw no change. The transactions for the day are recorded below:

Sterling (calculated per 1 national currency unit)

US Dollar (calculated per 100 national currency units)

### Sterling and US Gold Pounds Rise Sharply by 30-40 Cents

Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, the British-US dollar exchange rate fell by 0.0625, and foreign exchange settlements were still strong. Banks were reluctant to sell, leading to a temporary tightening of the market. Later, telegrams from Hong Kong gradually provided supply, and banks began to release funds, stabilizing market prices. Spot gold opened strong, and jewelers and other businesses slightly profited and closed their positions. Unexpectedly, Hong Kong and Shantou banks suddenly emerged to collect, becoming increasingly aggressive. The initial holdings were very limited, so once they started collecting, prices soared. It was rumored that they were rushing to load and transport goods to Hong Kong. Although the prices were raised excessively, there was no sign of a reversal in the short term, and the trend was very strong. Due to the sharp rise in spot gold, foreign currencies such as British and US gold pounds followed suit, rising sharply. Wealthy collectors were actively releasing their holdings. Foreign banks had a strong demand for British and US gold notes, and market prices rose slightly. Hong Kong notes, Singapore notes, and Dutch notes also rose slightly due to demand from travelers going abroad. Other currencies remained largely unchanged as exchange rates were still flat. No transactions took place at the association. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose by 40 cents, British gold notes rose by 8 cents, US gold pounds rose by 30 cents, US gold notes rose by 1.8 cents, Hong Kong notes rose by 0.2 cents, Singapore notes rose by 1 cent, and Dutch notes rose by 3 cents.

Yesterday, overseas silk markets saw another sharp rise in Japan and the United States.

The rise in forward rates was even more intense, opening at 1.97 yuan, a massive increase of 5.5 cents. Yokohama spot prices rose by 17 yuan, and forward prices rose by 25 yuan. Observing the market situation, there was a sense that demand was not meeting supply in both Japan and the United States. The rising trend in the silk market is bound to be quite persistent. The local Shanghai silk market had no transactions starting yesterday due to the upcoming Lunar New Year. Overseas silk prices are frequently reporting increases during the holiday, preparing for very high prices in red-plate trading after the holiday. It is expected that the local Shanghai silk market will be able to further display the remaining power of the rising trend on Thursday of next week, adding a brilliant touch to red-plate trading.

### Expecting News from Washington; US Cotton Dealers Observing

Unanimously Pessimistic About New Cotton

Overseas cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was unusually small, and speculators lacked interest. All industries were observing, waiting for news from Washington on this year's cotton legislation. However, the general opinion is that the past cotton legislation will definitely be changed, so there is a unanimous pessimistic view of new cotton. Yesterday, New York remained unchanged. The Indian cotton white rocks forecast for April-May remained at 148.5 robies. Egyptian cotton rose slightly by 2 pounds. Yesterday's exchange rates were weak again, and translated into legal tender cotton prices all rose.

### Metals: Locally Produced Wire Nails Continue to Increase

After the price of locally produced wire nails fell last month, the market has been quiet for a long time. Although the industry has made great efforts to promote sales, the overall situation has not been easy to reverse due to sluggish actual sales. In recent days, the factory has been unwilling to sell at low prices due to the tightening of foreign exchange, and the market has suddenly changed its old outlook. Buyers, fearing that the market will open higher in the red market after the Lunar New Year, financial houses with sufficient capital have been trying to collect. However, more than 3,000 barrels of spot goods have been collected from the hands of the industry. Confidence has been boosted, and the market atmosphere has suddenly strengthened. Market prices have continued to increase, with an increase of more than one yuan compared to the previous board. Yesterday, the final price was sold to 17.25 yuan. However, observing the thoughts of the holders, there is a possibility that the selling price will continue to increase in the future.

### Style of Certificate for National Debt Principal and Interest Coupon Exchange Approval

On February 10th, this newspaper gave a detailed account of the procedures for phased repayment of principal and interest on public bonds. As for the exchange approval certificate, since it had not yet been issued, there was no way to inquire about it at that time. Now that this certificate has been issued to Shanghai by the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing a few days ago, we hereby publish its style with illustrations for readers' reference.

The format of the national debt principal and interest coupon exchange approval certificate is almost exactly the same as the format of the public bond ticket, and the size is also the same. It can be divided into two parts: the exchange approval certificate and the coupon. The exchange approval certificate has six coupons attached below, arranged in two rows, with three coupons in each row. The first row is the fourth, fifth, sixth, and third coupons, and the second row is the first, second, third, and third coupons (arranged from left to right).

This certificate is stamped with a red square seal of the Ministry of Finance on the date of the Republic of China year, month, and day. In addition to the two small square seals of the Central Bank at the position of the managing agency, the Central Bank's embossed seal is also stamped. Except for "Bearer" and "Shanghai" as rubber stamps, the foreign currency amounts in the certificate are all filled in temporarily. As for the back of this certificate, three items of explanation are printed as follows:

(1) When paying each installment, this certificate should be taken to the original paying agency for withdrawal, and the corresponding coupon attached to the certificate should be cut off by the paying agency. The certificate holder shall not cut it off by himself.

(2) After this certificate is issued, no loss will be reported if it is lost, and any alterations will be invalid.

(3) This certificate should be collected and destroyed at the same time when the sixth installment is paid. The front format of the coupon is as follows:

If the amount of national currency is a decimal, it can be written in Arabic numerals. If the amount is large, it should be written in ink, as shown in the formula. A small square seal of the person in charge of the Shanghai paying agency is also stamped on the amount. The same riding corner embossed seal is also stamped on the coupon as on the certificate. The words "No. 0 installment" are printed horizontally on the back of the coupon. As shown in the above formula, "Fourth installment" is printed on the back of the coupon.

Since the Central Bank has already advanced one-sixth of the amount and paid it in cash, the coupon for the first installment has also been cut off when this national debt principal and interest exchange approval certificate is issued (c).

Spring and Autumn

### Busy New Year

— Sang Zi

The abolished calendar in Shanghai has now been restored to its former state. Some people say that the reason why the old calendar cannot be abolished is that customs are difficult to change. However, we believe that this is because in the past, the work of improving the people's lives and improving the people's livelihoods was still insufficient and too neglected, so it led to failure.

These days, the general "recluses" on the isolated island are busy with the stories of "thanking the gods and ancestors for the year," "eating New Year's Eve dinner," and "sending New Year's gifts." For this, I don't know how much money is squandered and wasted!

Thanking the gods and ancestors for the year is the representative of Chinese superstitious customs, and Shanghai is the most prosperous. The festival dates in Shanghai are quite inconsistent, but they are generally concentrated in the second half of the twelfth month of the abolished calendar. The sacrificial rituals are very grand. The wealthy have bright lights and candles, and set up banquets. The poor must also do their best to make a display. Their intention, it is said, is to seek the protection of the gods. In fact, the wealthy are showing off their wealth, and the poor are supporting their face.

Eating New Year's Eve dinner is the only reunion opportunity for Chinese families. On this evening, the whole family sits together, close relatives gather, or several friendly acquaintances participate, raising their fists and shouting "Five Kuis," eating dishes Cantonese "Yuan Shi," telling jokes, and talking about family affairs. Its form and its meaning are originally not to be criticized. However, with cups and plates crisscrossing and a messy floor, a rich feast costs more than ten gold, which is really enough to be called a waste.

Sending New Year's gifts is the most hypocritical and painful behavior in China. A New Year's gift must have several colors. You send it here, I send it there, fully showing the hypocrisy of the cumbersome formalities. And some people take advantage of the opportunity to use the name of New Year's gifts, but bribery is rampant, which is not only wasteful, but also base.

At a time when the earth is stained with blood, if we have so much leisure and elegance to spend this residual year, we should think about the warriors who are putting out the flames of aggression, living such a difficult and arduous life? And those displaced and suffering compatriots, living such a tragic and painful life? And save some waste and transfer it for consolation or relief needs.

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Civil Group Fundraising Committee recently launched the Day Rescue Disaster Relief Movement, which not only has profound significance, but is also in line with the requirements of the times. We very much agree with it, and at the same time hope that the general public will work together to complete this task!

### Sending New Year Greetings to My Brother

— Hu Zhifu

Reform is a difficult thing, as can be seen from the fact that the old calendar has not been completely abolished despite its disuse. Actually, without the sound of the lunar drums, there's no point in striking them, but in Shanghai, the New Year atmosphere is still very much present.

Having no customs at all would make us seem unlike a nation with history, but the insistence on certain customs is ultimately limited to the class that has the power to insist.

Like last year, we were stranded in Wuhan, in a house that was shaking from the anti-aircraft guns, running from upstairs to downstairs, and then immediately from downstairs to upstairs. On one hand, we were excitedly hoping to discover something, and on the other, we were anxiously unsure of where it was safer. Who even remembered that it was New Year's Eve, the day to thank the Kitchen God?

This year, we can be considered to have a home, but does it really feel like a home? Originally, there was no stove to offer sacrifices to. On the twenty-third day of the lunar month, even the only coal stove we had was cold all day. Watching others use inferior sweets to pay respect to the Kitchen God, someone joked, "You eat chocolate and coffee, aren't you afraid the Kitchen God will say bad things about you?" I wasn't prepared for someone to ask about our Kitchen God!

Only in the countryside can I imagine the six-year-old child about to venture out, holding an oversized copper tray with a paper bridge, red candles, scriptures, and a cup of wine placed on it, walking from the stove to the open air. Surely, it is the great-grandfather wearing the black felt hat who is burning paper offerings, telling others to cover their ears to set off firecrackers.

On the twenty-fifth night, although my wife is not a child, her words are unrestrained. She still says her "I'm going to die" and "as if in a dream." Should I smear her mouth with toilet paper?

And now, it's time to celebrate the New Year's blessings.

My father-in-law invited the gods last night. I also asked my wife: Shall we buy some meat? She said, "She" doesn't like to eat meat, imagine that!

We are not preparing a New Year's Eve dinner, so we have to politely decline the invitation from a Cantonese sister-in-law (our neighbor), because giving without receiving is impolite.

How to spend New Year's Eve, I have not decided yet. Going to my father-in-law's house might be inappropriate. Eating out with my wife, I don't know what that would be like. Not returning to the countryside, not being at the old home, the New Year's Eve of the past cannot be relived!

Think back to last year's New Year's Eve, we were on a boat, going from Hankou to Yichang. Watching the sailors light red candles and bow deeply, my brother and I each had a bowl of tasteless, hard rice. We cut some beef, made a cup of soup with dried vegetables brought from home, and stood silently facing each other next to our berths. After the meal, I could only listlessly go alone to the deck, letting the wind on the Yangtze River sweep the tears into the water of the Yangtze River. Returning to the cabin, who didn't sigh softly? Such a New Year's Eve was the first in my life. Then someone hummed "My home is on the Songhua River in Northeast China"!

My father-in-law said that this year's New Year should be better than last year's. Even so, I will not forget that you are still drifting thousands of miles away.

As strong as you are, you can't avoid being fragile at times. In Chongqing, perhaps the New Year's atmosphere won't be as apparent as here, but can you not have memories? I worry that you will cry again, cry like a child. At the very least, you will have another night of "dry insomnia," but you are not like me. You won't have prolonged sadness. You will immediately be motivated, able to grit your teeth. You are still you.

Another year, another year. You are growing and progressing. I wish you all things new in the new year!

### ### Meng Jiangnu

— Ruhu

When Yuan Muzhi directed "Street Angel," he insisted on having Zhou Xuan play the role of the little singing girl in the play, and Zhou Xuan also created a vivid image of this little singing girl. Therefore, Zhou Xuan's ability to jump from the music scene to the film scene in a very short period was indeed not accidental.

Now, she is playing Meng Jiangnu, and her appearance and acting skills are suitable for this ideal unfortunate woman. For example, her dignity and charm when singing "A Hundred Flowers Like Brocade"; her poise and generosity when exploring the West Chamber at night; her heartbreaking and moving performance at the long pavilion farewell; her passionate blood when assassinating the alchemist: she is competent and happy in all of them.

"Meng Jiangnu" is also a well-known folk tale, but the existence of this story contains a strong feudal ideology. Therefore, the screenwriter Mr. Wu Cun said: "Meng Jiangnu's" narrative or opera has always given people a vague and ethereal impression, without profound ideas. In fact, there are many things worth re-evaluating here, such as "Building the Great Wall" and "Sending Winter Clothes"... all contain rich political issues and social thoughts. In order to make it like "Pan Jinlian" so that people can transform their old concepts and get new feelings, I have almost completely overturned what should be overturned and decorated what should be decorated in the content of "Meng Jiangnu." For example, Wan Xiliang, who was originally an elegant and weak scholar, has become a patriot who eliminates traitors. But its inherent strangeness and structure are still preserved.

We greatly admire Mr. Wu Cun's re-evaluation of "Meng Jiangnu," but after we finished watching "Meng Jiangnu," we felt that there were still some points in Mr. Wu Cun's new evaluation that could be discussed. Please allow me to bring them up. "Qin Shihuang annexed the six kingdoms, burned books and buried scholars, and forcibly conscripted people to build the Great Wall to prevent the patriots of Chu from uniting with foreign tribes to recover their lost territories, and to consolidate his tyrannical throne." Symbolizing the tyranny of the aggressor with this generation of tyrants, and using the sacrifice of the Chu patriot Wan Xiliang for the country and Meng Jiangnu's assassination of the alchemist on a stormy night to symbolize the arrival of light is indeed an accurate new evaluation of "Meng Jiangnu." However, we cannot deny that the Great Wall is an ancient Chinese national defense building. After Meng Jiangnu assassinated the alchemist, Mr. Wu Cun may have wanted to strengthen the new strength by using a close-up of the collapse of the Great Wall built "to prevent the patriots of Chu from uniting with foreign tribes to recover their lost territories" to end the scene. The original intention was indeed well-intentioned, but on the point that "the Great Wall is an ancient Chinese national defense building," it is easy to cause misunderstanding. When Meng Jiangnu explored the West Chamber at night, Wan Xiliang said this: "... What is needed now is not the Great Wall, but the new Great Wall created with the blood and flesh of how many people"! Therefore, in my personal opinion, before the opening scene of the Great Wall suddenly collapsing, a very short film should be used to depict how Qin Shihuang forced the people to build the Great Wall, the people's complaints were full of resentment, and the Great Wall was built very sloppily. And when Wan Xiliang sacrificed to the city, he should have made a generous speech, telling the people about the conspiracy of Shihuang to build the Great Wall, even if the Great Wall could prevent the patriots of the Six Kingdoms from recovering their lost territories, the Great Wall created by our blood and flesh will have greater power! In this way, finally using the collapse of the Great Wall to symbolize the end of the aggressor will have a greater effect on strengthening the new strength, and will not cause misunderstandings. This may be my demanding, I don't know what Mr. Wu Cun thinks.

Regarding the performance part, if the director can strengthen the tragic atmosphere, such as the reluctance of the couple to part when Wan Xiliang was arrested, and the difficult situation on the road when Meng Jiangnu sent the winter clothes, it will be even more touching; and now, You Guangzhao, Han Langen, Yin Xiucen and the two maids' plays are taking over the main event.

The picture is very beautiful, and the photography and sound recording are also clear.

### On the Line of Hunger and Cold

— Gong Huai

Heng, whom I haven't seen for a long time, is a young man who grew up in the south of the Yangtze River and has lived in the north for a long time. In the year before the Lugou Bridge Incident, when the flames of war filled the sky, he fled in a panic from Beiping under the guns and returned to his hometown in the desolate suburbs of Shanghai. Unexpectedly, as soon as he unloaded his luggage and his shock hadn't subsided, the flames of the August 13th Incident surrounded his tranquil hometown in the battle line. So, he wandered on the road of exile, from Suzhou to Zhenjiang, to Hankou, to Guangzhou, to Hong Kong. Finally, when his purse was empty and he had no way to make a living, and he deeply felt the sorrow of drifting in a foreign land, he decided to return to Shanghai to find a job.

He came to the isolated island at the beginning of February last year. At that time, living in a relative's house, he formulated three steps to find a job. The first was to ask relatives and friends to introduce him, the second was to search for opportunities in the recruitment ads in the newspapers, and the third was to publish self-introduction ads that didn't cost money or go to the door to recommend himself like Mao Sui. But what was the result of the first step? He sent more than 20 letters asking for job introductions, and received replies from eight of them. Among them, three said "There are too many people and not enough jobs, so it is impossible to find one," three said "If there is an opportunity, I will definitely do my best," and two said "I have already entrusted it to a friend to see the effect later." He naturally waited in vain for more than two months. The second step was even more troublesome. Not only did he need talent, but he also needed money and power. Several times, he rushed to take the exam, but lost the opportunity because he had to pay a deposit. Several times he decided to throw away the "application fee" in vain, and there was no follow-up. There were also several times, when he rushed to the destination, it had already been taken by someone who was one step ahead, and he naturally didn't want to do things that betrayed his conscience, so he wasted another two months in vain. After the third step was implemented, it was even more like a wild goose flying into the darkness, a flower in a mirror, or the moon in the water.

Later, he decided to take off his long robe and find some work that sold his strength. Finally, with the help of his relatives and friends, he spent more than two yuan to get a permit to sell sweets at the pier. He carried a small leather bag full of sweets and went to the new customs dock on the Bund early in the morning to sell to every ship about to set sail. Until the evening, he finally earned a little over one yuan and two cents, and he felt unspeakable joy in his heart. Who knew that when he went the next day, a hooligan was waiting for him there, wanting him to "pay respects" and recognize him as his apprentice. He was unwilling, and as a result, he was surrounded, and the sweets box was thrown into the rolling turbid waves of the Huangpu River. Another time, a school posted an advertisement to recruit a school worker. He hurried to the address before the specified time, waiting outside the gate, fearing that someone would get there first. When the time came, he saw that there were only two people competing with him outside the school gate. Comparing from appearance, response, and level, he was sure that he had a hope of being selected. Who knew that he was blocked by the gatekeeper when he wanted to go in, who only said that the affairs officer was not free now. Later, a relative whom the gatekeeper had arranged came and went straight into the school. He turned around and left with a belly full of resentment. Another time, he finally found a job as a proofreader and secretary, stating that the monthly salary was 20 yuan, without providing food and accommodation. After doing it for two months, not only did he not receive a penny, but he also paid a lot of tram fares, because the magazine's economy "went bankrupt" and declared its closure. Alas! It is really more difficult to find a job on the isolated island than to ascend to the blue sky. This is a social problem worthy of attention!

At this point, the three young ladies being spoken of all started to laugh. The train had already passed Kunshan, and along the way, besides village houses and fields, there were also a few scattered villa-style houses. The Agricultural College has a branch in Kunshan, as well as several chicken farms, rabbit farms, etc., which are very developed. But this express train doesn't stop in Kunshan, it speeds past. The time was a little after 9:30. The radio in the carriage suddenly sounded. It turns out that the railways in China now have this facility. Even though they are traveling, the passengers all want to know some news. And having such a facility can also relieve the boredom of a long journey. At 9:30, they first played some music, and then reported the news. There were a few very important items in today's news. First, they reported domestic news, and then foreign news. One of the domestic news items was about the Yellow River water management project. China has a Yellow River that often causes trouble, and it has never been quiet for a few years. In the era of war, there was even less time to pay attention to it. This is a constant source of anxiety in China, but watercourses can be both a disaster and a benefit. If it is well-managed, it will be an infinite benefit to the country and the people. Just thinking about irrigating farmland, the benefits are incalculable. Now, the officials of the Chinese government believe that river management is the biggest project for China's construction, and it cannot be delayed. Therefore, they will do their best to make it a permanent solution. However, for a newly emerging country like China, the large amount of funding required for river management is considerable. Therefore, a new river management loan was borrowed from the United States, totaling 100 million US dollars. In the future, the profits from the output of the Yellow River basin after the river management will be used to repay the loan. It will probably be paid off in less than five years. What Leidianhua reported today was not the success of the river management loan, because this river management loan was signed and finalized three months ago. What was reported today was the news that the Yellow River Water Management Committee had hired water management experts from abroad. In addition to our own country's water management engineering experts, ten experts were hired from abroad. These ten people are from various countries, and the chief engineer is an American. He is already over seventy years old, with rich experience and high technology. Despite his old age, he is willing to come to China to serve. Because he had lived in the Yellow River basin in China for several years and usually paid close attention to it. This was the first news report today. (42)
