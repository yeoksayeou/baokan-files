### Chen Cheng Confident of China's Victory: The Worst Period is Over; Japanese Troops Ambushed in the Dahong Mountains and Surrounded Near Zao City; Chinese Troops in Hubei Province Approaching Jingshan and Fiercely Attacking its Suburbs; Chinese Troops at Pengze and Hukou Recapture Taiping Pass and Shijianpu

(Chongqing) General Chen Cheng, currently commanding the battles in Jiangxi-Hunan and northern Hubei, and considered one of China's capable generals, received news reporters here this afternoon and declared: "We do not expect to win this year or next year, but if we continue to fight for three to five years, we will ultimately achieve final victory." Reviewing the battle situation, the general said that not only are the Japanese troops unable to make any further progress, but they are also trapped by Chinese troops within their occupied areas. In the areas behind the Japanese front lines, in addition to guerrillas and mobile units, there are still as many as sixty divisions of regular Chinese troops. The Japanese troops in northern Hubei concentrated three infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade, namely the troops of the 33rd and 16th Divisions, in an attempt to encircle the Chinese troops under the command of General Tang Enbo. However, after five days and nights of fighting in the scorching sun, the Japanese encirclement plan has failed. Currently, Sun Lianzhong and Liu Ruming's troops are stationed in Xinye, and one army corps under the command of General Liu Heding is stationed in the Dahong Mountains. The Japanese troops can no longer advance towards Xiangfan. As for the Nanchang war zone under his command, since the Chinese troops repelled the Japanese troops in Wuning, the Japanese troops have been unable to invade Hunan Province. Chinese troops even launched a counter-offensive against Nanchang on April 22nd. Although they failed to recapture the city, several hundred men twice charged into the city, but unfortunately, they could not establish a foothold inside the city. The main purpose of the Chinese counter-offensive against Nanchang was to support the defending troops in northern Hubei and prevent the Japanese troops from moving from Jiangxi Province to the Xiangfan area. Although the Japanese troops have cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Chinese troops can still maintain transportation through the more southerly highways and coastal areas. The Japanese troops currently have thirty infantry divisions and three cavalry brigades distributed in the following locations: a total of three divisions in Guangdong and Hainan Island, two divisions in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway area and southern Anhui, five divisions in Jiangxi-Hunan and northern Hubei, three divisions in the Xiangfan area, plus one cavalry brigade, two divisions in northern Anhui and the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, four divisions in northern Jiangxi, the Jinpu and Shandong Railway areas, three and a half divisions in Hebei-Chahar, two divisions in eastern Henan and the Daoqing Railway area, five divisions in Shanxi Province, and two divisions in northern Shanxi and Suiyuan. China's most difficult period has now passed. The general frankly admitted that China's most critical time was at the beginning of the Lugouqiao Incident. At that time, there were different opinions in North China regarding the issue of war and peace. It was decided after the fall of the capital that China had suffered a terrible loss in this battle. If the Japanese troops could not inflict a decisive defeat on the Chinese troops in the battles to capture Nanjing and Hankou, then this opportunity would never come again. The general concluded, "China will surely achieve final victory, this is only a matter of time." (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)

(Chongqing) General Chen Cheng declared today that Japan is currently encountering four major problems in the occupied areas: a lack of time, labor, capital, and political and social stability. It is said that Japan's financial resources have been exhausted and it is unable to develop the occupied areas. The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan and Germany's Four-Year Plan both require huge amounts of capital to be implemented. Japan currently lacks the financial resources, so Japan will never be able to develop China's resources to conquer China. According to custom, it takes three to five years to make a profit after investing in the development of any land. It has been eight years since Japan invested in the three northeastern provinces, but it still cannot gain any benefits. Furthermore, if Japan wants to use China's resources to conquer China, it must first consider the issue of "time." At present, the number of Chinese laborers helping Japan is extremely small. Chinese workers are unwilling to cooperate with Japan or help Japan develop China's resources, so it is impossible to maintain political and social stability in the occupied areas. The Japanese occupation of Nanchang is militarily beneficial to the Chinese troops, because thereafter the Chinese troops do not need to defend the areas south of the Xiu River, which can allow the Chinese troops to avoid attacks from certain directions. The Japanese troops are currently engaged in defensive battles in a vast area, because their strength has been greatly reduced due to the attack on Nanchang. Furthermore, we have occupied certain points on the railway between Nanchang and Jiujiang, so Japanese transportation is very inconvenient. The railway between Zhejiang and Jiangxi has been cut off, but the highway is still open. In addition, the Chinese troops south and east of Nanchang are self-sufficient and have now been reorganized into mobile units. The Chinese counter-offensives towards Gao'an and Nanchang have prevented the Japanese troops from achieving their goal of encircling the Chinese troops north of Hubei and south of Hunan. Now the strength of the Japanese troops has been greatly damaged, and the Chinese troops are taking the opportunity to counterattack at certain points. Therefore, the power of the counter-offensive is completely in our hands. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)

(Guilin) On the 21st, more than two hundred Japanese troops attacked the Chinese position in Gaoyou City, and the fighting was very fierce. The main force of the Chinese troops was transferred to the southern bank area. (Special dispatch, 22nd)

Fancheng: The Japanese troops who collapsed from Zaoyang fell into a trap set by Chinese guerrillas in the Dahong Mountains and are unable to extricate themselves. They have been repeatedly annihilated by Chinese troops in recent days, and their losses have reached half. After Chinese troops recaptured Zao City, the remaining Japanese troops were still surrounded and attacked by Chinese troops near Zao City on the 22nd. Judging from the fact that the Japanese troops were forced to retreat to Suizao and that a large number of reinforcements have recently arrived from Wuhan, it can be concluded that the Japanese troops' decision to invade northern Hubei has resulted in serious consequences for them. (Dispatch, 22nd)

Shashi: After Chinese troops recaptured Wamiaoji and Yanmenkou, they have launched attacks towards Yonglong River and Lujiazhai in recent days, capturing many enemies. Currently, communication between the Japanese troops in various places has been cut off by Chinese troops. In addition, Chinese troops have been advancing towards Jingshan in recent days and occupied Lanjiaji yesterday, annihilating several hundred Japanese troops. They are now approaching the suburbs of Jingshan and fiercely attacking the city. (Dispatch, 22nd)

Fuliang: The battles between Pengze and Hukou are currently developing. On the 20th, Chinese troops launched a large-scale attack on Taiping Pass and recaptured the area, and then took advantage of the victory to recapture Shijianpu. The remaining Japanese troops retreated in confusion towards Yangjiashan, Dingshan, and the riverside. (Dispatch, 22nd)

Fengcheng: Chinese guerrillas attacked the Japanese troops in Xishan Wanshou Palace on the night of the 20th, inflicting heavy casualties on them, and destroyed a large bridge east of Wanshou Palace. On the morning of the 21st, dozens of Japanese troops took three cars to reinforce, but were also repelled by Chinese troops. The guerrillas near Niuhang on the Chinese side have been very active in recent days, launching frequent attacks and capturing many enemies. (Dispatch, 22nd)

### Xinhui is Still Under Artillery Fire; Japanese Troops in Jiujiang Reinforce Jiangmen

(Hong Kong) Shaoguan is currently evacuating its population and supplies and taking all necessary measures to prevent indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes. Chinese troops are heavily guarding Xiangshan and Guifeng Mountain west of Xinhui City. Artillery battles were still in progress on the morning of the 22nd. More than two hundred Japanese artillerymen and more than five hundred infantrymen from Jiujiang left for Jiangmen yesterday to reinforce. In addition, Japanese troops have been shelling the coast along Heshan for days to prevent Chinese troops from crossing the river in the rain to launch a counter-offensive. (Special dispatch, 11:00 PM, 22nd)

Sihui: The Japanese troops in Jiangmen are constantly sending reinforcements to Xinhui. On the 19th, more than thirty Japanese troops landed from a small motorboat along the Mei River between Jinniushan and Fenjiang outside the west gate of Xinhui and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese guard troops. In addition, a part of the Chinese troops advanced to the north gate of Xinhui on the morning of the 19th. The Japanese troops are stubbornly resisting behind solid fortifications, and fierce fighting is in progress. (Dispatch, 22nd)

### Chinese Troops in Southern Shanxi Achieve Repeated Victories

Xingji: Chinese troops attacked Qingxiang Town in Fenxi on the night of the 18th and reached the line of Donggoudi at Baoluo at midnight. They occupied the high ground at the western end of Donggoudi. More than one hundred Chinese commandoes took advantage of the momentum to rush into Chengjiazhuang, engaging in melee combat several times. Most of the one hundred Japanese defenders were annihilated. At this time, the Chinese artillery also exerted its power, and two Japanese artillery pieces in Donggoudi and on the high ground were destroyed by Chinese troops. (Dispatch, 22nd)

### Japanese Planes Bombed Zhenhai Yesterday

Ningbo: Four Japanese planes bombed the east gate of Zhenhai at 10:00 this morning, dropping ten bombs. There was no major damage. (Special dispatch, afternoon, 22nd)

### No Change in Situation at Gulangyu; Discussions on Troop Withdrawal Have Not Reached a Compromise; Director of Refugee Camp Arrested, Schools for Refugee Children Closed; Residences of Chinese Staff at the Municipal Council Also Invaded by Japanese Soldiers; America Prepares to Defend All Rights and Deal with Any Aggression

Gulangyu: According to indirect information from here, the Chinese arrested by Japanese sailors after landing in the public concession here and taken to Xiamen have been subjected to severe torture. The exact number of those arrested is unknown, but it is generally believed to be around two hundred, including one British-Chinese citizen. The British authorities immediately tried to rescue him, but he was only released after several days. A doctor's examination revealed that he was covered in wounds from torture. The situation here is currently still deadlocked. Britain, France, and the United States continue to station 42 sailors each, the same number as the Japanese sailors. It is said that discussions on simultaneous troop withdrawal have been in progress, but it seems that no compromise has been reached so far. The stationing of British, American, and French troops here has clearly eased the tense situation, but without the withdrawal of Japanese soldiers, it is difficult to restore normalcy. The Japanese side cited the assassination of Hong Lixun, the "president of the Chamber of Commerce" in Xiamen, as a pretext for sending troops to land. It has not yet been proven whether this assassination was directly motivated by politics. The landing Japanese soldiers have searched house by house, but have not captured the murderer. The Japanese military search teams went directly into Chinese houses, causing schools for Chinese refugee children to close one after another. The director of a refugee camp housing 6,000 people was arrested by the Japanese military. The staff in the camp were greatly frightened, and the relief work was also affected. The residences of the Chinese staff of the Gulangyu Municipal Council Police Department were also invaded by Japanese soldiers. It is generally believed that these Chinese staff members are quite discouraged by this kind of threat. It is said that there were also incidents of illegal invasion of British property by Japanese soldiers. The British authorities are currently compiling a detailed report on this matter. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)

(Hong Kong) According to reports from here today, the Gulangyu Municipal Council authorities arrested four so-called pro-Japanese Chinese and originally planned to deport them today. However, the Japanese consul interfered. The Japanese consul is currently negotiating with the Gulangyu authorities for the release of the four pro-Japanese Chinese. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)

(Washington) Today, Senator Pepper, a Democrat representative from Florida and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared that recent developments in the Far East have made the United States prepared to defend all its rights to deal with any aggression. He also said that Japan's decision not to continue occupying Gulangyu may improve relations between the United States and Japan. He predicted that Japan would continue to pursue a "sensible and rational policy" in the future. He further expressed his deep belief that Japan would abandon its idea of unilaterally abolishing the treaties. An improvement in relations between the United States and Japan would reduce the pressure to pass the Pittman Amendment to the Neutrality Act (embargo of goods ordinance). (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)

### Japanese Troops in Tongxiang Annihilated

Jinhua: A Chinese unit in western Zhejiang, with a miraculous battle tactic, suddenly attacked Tongxiang on the 13th, rushed into the city, and immediately surrounded and fiercely attacked the Japanese troops entrenched in the city. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and were completely annihilated by the Chinese troops, without a single one escaping. The city was immediately recaptured. The residents saw the arrival of the Chinese troops again and warmly welcomed them with food and drink. (Dispatch, 22nd)

### Strong Young Men and Farmers Voluntarily Enlist

(Guiyang) Four farmers from Rongjiang, Wang Peichun, Wang Shijie, Zhan Benjun, and Yang Shuqing, have voluntarily enlisted in the army. People from all walks of life in the county gave them a warm send-off. When they set off, Wang and others shouted slogans such as "Good men go to be soldiers." (Dispatch, 22nd)

(Xi'an) Eight brave men from Qishan County, including Wang Jianxi, recently submitted a joint request to the county government, requesting to enlist in the army. After receiving the request, the county government considered that the brave men had a deep understanding of righteousness and a keen love for the country, and were worthy of commendation, and approved their request and commended them. (Dispatch, 22nd)

### British Army Commander in Shanghai Arrives in Hong Kong from England

(Hong Kong) The newly appointed British Army Commander in Shanghai, Simons, arrived in Hong Kong from England on the 21st and set off for Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd to take office. (Dispatch, 22nd)

Editorial

### The German-Italian Alliance

Just as the British and Soviet Union were tirelessly engaged in so-called 'counter-proposals' and 'compromise plans,' with negotiations progressing almost in a state of semi-sleep, Germany and Italy yesterday completed the formal procedures for concluding an alliance, signing a political and military treaty. The seven articles of the alliance are simple and clear. The content it contains itself does not have any new significance compared to the year-long collusion between the two countries. However, its objective significance ironically mocks the British-Soviet negotiations.

Hitler and Mussolini waved the false banner of anti-communism to conceal the true face of aggression. They previously launched aggression with profound determination; now they express their determination with a public alliance. Since the Munich Agreement, the European balance of power maintained by Britain's traditional policy has been completely destroyed. Chamberlain's policy of 'appeasement,' which condoned Germany and Italy, fundamentally overturned the traditional European balance of power of the past century. According to Chamberlain and Daladier's plans, they originally wanted to dismantle the collusion between Germany and Italy through concessions at Munich—to deepen their conflict in Central Europe; they wanted to open the door for Hitler's eastward advance at the expense of Czechoslovakia. They hoped that Hitler would be satisfied in Central and Eastern Europe and would turn around and fulfill his promise of 'eastward advance' announced in 'Mein Kampf.' However, today, the 'appeasement' policy has finally completely failed. The alliance signed yesterday at least confirms the failure of the dismantling policy. Future eastward advances, westward advances, and even southward and northward advances, await democratic countries to give him appropriate opportunities.

Hitler is not a fool. He knows the power of the Soviet Union. He gleaned many meanings from Stalin's report at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party. At least for now, he will never attack the Soviet Union head-on. Originally, in Hitler's speeches several times this year, he had revised 'Mein Kampf.' He openly demanded colonies, which was not mentioned in 'Mein Kampf.' He also repeatedly stated that 'in any war, Germany will stand with Italy.' All of this clearly has a strong anti-British connotation. 'Mein Kampf' was not anti-British. However, the victory of Fascist blackmail and their 'achievements' in Spain have unveiled a new stage in the severe European situation. The German-Italian military alliance is a more public and superficial manifestation of this severe situation. Britain has become their most direct target. Berlin's recent active construction of a navy proves that Hitler pays more attention to Britain and France than to the Soviet Union. All clever attempts to dismantle the German-Italian axis have proven to be a waste of imagination. Peace cannot be established with a 'appeasement' policy aimed at dismantling them. A firmly established universal peace can shatter their common will to aggression!

In this situation, the British people and public opinion are increasingly awakening and feel the need to urgently cooperate with France and the Soviet Union to establish an anti-aggression front. The British-Soviet negotiations were produced under the impetus of this force. However, Prime Minister Chamberlain may not have the determination to thoroughly cooperate with the Soviet Union, and he has not given up the illusion of compromise with Germany and Italy. Frankly speaking: he still wants to carry out his old policy in this new direction. He wants to use the British-Soviet rapprochement as a weapon to coerce Hitler. He wants to impose heavy unilateral obligations on the Soviet Union to achieve his attempt to 'buy the casket and return the pearl.' Therefore, although Britain has repeatedly proposed 'counter-proposals' and 'compromise plans,' the British-Soviet talks have not made much progress.

The German-Italian military alliance has finally been formally signed. The semi-sleep state in the British-Soviet negotiations may awaken due to ridicule and irony. For the sake of universal anti-aggression and universal peace, we hope that the British-Soviet negotiations will immediately awaken and catch up. However, our hearing and sense of smell simultaneously detect an anesthetic and hypnotic atmosphere. Although the German-Italian alliance has no new meaning, the broadcast speeches and talks with reporters by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano after signing the alliance and drinking champagne (all seen in today's news column, Berlin dispatch) revealed a lot of temptation in a fierce and weak tone. They breathed a gentle breath on Chamberlain's appeasement policy and Roosevelt's call for peace. This is enough to anesthetize and hypnotize those who are indecisive and have an unclear understanding. Chamberlain wanted to dismantle the German-Italian axis long ago, but did not succeed. And Germany and Italy are using their method to treat their person, and the speeches and interviews after yesterday's signing may not want to interrupt the British-Soviet negotiations. Of course, Chamberlain is old and sophisticated after all, and he is not a fool after all.

### Fujianese Organize Suicide Squad to Cross the Sea and Launch a Surprise Attack on Kinmen; Divided into Three Teams to Attack Japanese Barracks; Stabbed and Killed Many, Destroyed Supplies; Goals Achieved, Withdraw in an Orderly Manner

(Fuzhou) The islands of Kinmen and Xiamen in southern Fujian are isolated at sea, resulting in their invasion. The residents along the Chinese coast have been in pain and anger for a long time. Xu Tieqiong, Chen Dayuan and other [illegible] people recently organized a brave suicide squad, who, on the evening of the 20th of last month, took advantage of the dark night to board boats and cross the sea to carry out the first brave act of a surprise attack on the Japanese troops on Kinmen. That night, the moon was dark and the tide was surging. It took four hours to cross the Kinmen coast. After landing, they immediately divided into three teams. One team was responsible for sabotage and ambush to create a diversion. One team went straight to the red western-style building in Guan'ao, which was occupied by the Japanese troops. They immediately stabbed and killed the Japanese sentry and rushed to the ground floor, concentrating their firepower. The sound of Mauser pistols, machine guns, and grenades went off at the same time. The Japanese soldiers were awakened from their dreams and desperately fought back. In the dark, most of them were annihilated by the Chinese. As the Chinese side withdrew, they could still hear the screams of women in the building. The third team sneaked to the southeast corner and, with agility, rushed into the No. 10 barracks of the Japanese troops at the branch office. They immediately killed 14 Japanese soldiers and destroyed their artillery and supplies, and withdrew in an orderly manner. They boarded the boats together. After they were far from the shore, they heard heavy gunfire on the island. The Chinese side had already returned in triumph. The total spoils of this raid included two machine guns, six rifles, two steel helmets, two Japanese flags, six bayonets, six military uniforms, 142 rounds of ammunition, and many other symbols and parts. The Japanese soldiers killed by the Chinese were from the 2nd and 4th companies of the Sasebo 2nd Special Naval Landing Force, Western Detachment. Those whose names could be verified included "Itaizumi," "Hasegawa," "Yoshinari Kazuno," "Hayashibe Zo," "Ito," etc., all first-class sailors. The Japanese troops annihilated inside and outside the western-style building were not included. The Chinese side only lost two men, Zheng Liang and Zheng Bian. Chinese commanders, upon receiving the report, have given commendations and provided for the families of the fallen soldiers, to encourage loyalty. (Dispatch, 21st)

### Puppet Regime Declares Mongolian Planes Crossed the Border

(Changchun) According to official news revealed here today, a squadron of Outer Mongolian bombers flew into "Manchukuo" territory on May 20. One of them was shot down by "Manchukuo" machine gunners. It is said that the incident occurred near Lake Balnur. All the people in the plane were killed, but the number of those killed has not been announced. It is also said that border disputes between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia have been increasing recently. Prior to this case, there was another border crossing incident on May 15, when Outer Mongolian troops crossed the Khara River east of Lake Balnur and began building fortifications inside "Manchukuo." They were then severely damaged and driven back by the joint Japanese-"Manchukuo" forces. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)

### Chongqing: Establishment of a New Type of Refugee Camp Allows Displaced Victims to Quickly Restore Their Past Lives

(Chongqing) Four hundred refugees here, most of whom are children, today established a new type of refugee camp with funds allocated by the Chinese Refugee Relief Committee. The difference between this refugee camp and other refugee camps is that it is based on self-sufficiency. The purpose of establishing such a refugee camp is to allow displaced refugees to quickly restore their past lives. The refugee camp is located in a temple. The women in it spend all day sewing, and the men mostly engage in sawing wood and hammering operations outside the temple, building new houses. Cadres of the New Life Movement are arranging workshops so that the refugees' machinery and tools can be placed there. The refugees here receive a daily food allowance of 15 cents. In addition to vegetables, their diet occasionally includes meat. At the same time, the authorities are deeply concerned that unsanitary food will easily spread diseases, so they are extremely cautious about cooking and have hired a doctor to prepare for unexpected illnesses. Although these refugees have lost contact with their families, they are happy as usual and have no worries. According to the cadres of the New Life Movement, allowing refugees to have work can not only give them a sense of self-esteem for independent living, but also prevent them from worrying about their experiences. What is most gratifying is that the children among them, although mostly orphans picked up on the road, are able to work hard and make a living. At the same time, the New Life Movement has also established many children's schools to enable children to learn to write. Furthermore, all children are under the care of government personnel from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. They have three hours of classes every day and form boys and girls scouts, giving them patriotic education and teaching them various skills.

### General Li Zongren Discusses the Current Military Situation; Described by a Reuters Reporter; China Has Not Yet Planned a General Offensive; Aims to Deplete Japanese Forces; Japan Sinks Deeper and Deeper into the Mire; Deriving No Lasting Benefit

In a certain area of Central China, a reporter recently met General Li Zongren at his secret war zone headquarters, where he was informed of the current military situation in China, with particular attention to the situation in Northern Hubei. Li first stated, "I fear I cannot bring much good news. We cannot tell you when we will recover Hankou or begin a general offensive. We are determined to defeat the Japanese, but we are not planning any general offensive, only continuous small-scale attacks to deplete Japanese forces without overusing our own strength. To date, the Japanese army has been unable to break China's national strength, and now there are few opportunities to do so. The Japanese army can indeed occupy towns, but as they advance, the land they occupy behind them is recovered by Chinese forces." Li then cited the Dabie Mountains as an example, saying that before the Japanese army occupied Hankou, they had occupied many places in those mountains. When the Japanese army advanced towards Wuhan and Nanchang, these many places were all retaken by Chinese forces. When the Japanese army withdrew from Nanchang to Hubei province, Chinese forces rushed to the vicinity of Nanchang, recaptured Gao'an, and have now surrounded Nanchang. Li continued, "If the Japanese army stops attacking, we will attack, regardless of victory or defeat. In order to maintain its position and maintain the trust of its people, Japan will inevitably attempt to advance, but what it gains will only serve to exhaust its strength further, with no lasting benefit to speak of. The Japanese have not been effective in controlling our natural resources and manpower. The Japanese army is trapped in a mire, sinking deeper and deeper. The Japanese army came with great force, but is now visibly weakening, while China is becoming more united and organized. The Japanese army in China totals more than thirty divisions, but they are all scattered in various places, subject to harassment by Chinese guerrillas and regular forces, even in the suburbs of Shanghai. I only use one-third of my troops on each front, while the rest continue to be trained and recuperate in the rear. This ratio remains constant, so although our army's equipment is inferior to the Japanese army's, its efficiency is growing daily." Li continued, "China's resources are now being consumed by the war, and may be exhausted by the end of the war, but the Chinese people are determined not to be slaves of Japan, or to sacrifice themselves, their children, and their freedom to make peace with Japan. Our suffering and burdens are beyond words, but no one in the country is asking for peace talks. We have lost Hankou, which many people thought could not be lost, but we are still fighting with unwavering determination." Li also stated that four divisions of Japanese reinforcements have now arrived on the front lines of Northern Hubei, and may be used to attack Xiangfan. Although the Japanese army attacks regardless of losses, and Chinese forces are forced to retreat, Japan will pay a heavy price in casualties for what it gains, which will not only fail to strengthen its position, but will only create temporary victory news for Japanese newspapers. Li also issued a sincere warning to the other countries of the world about the consequences of allowing the war in the Far East to continue and failing to take any measures to stop the aggression. He said, "During the September 18th Shenyang Incident, I gave a speech at a banquet, warning British diplomats and naval personnel of the possible consequences of the Japanese attack. What I said has now been proven correct. I wonder if anyone who was present at the time still remembers it. We are now doing our utmost to cope with the war. Other countries can help us with very little cost to themselves, but with great help to us. We need a small amount of money, and we need technical assistance to make up for our military shortcomings." After Li finished speaking, he asked the reporter about the latest news from Europe, and expressed his firm grasp of the various political and military strategic issues in the current European situation. Like most of his countrymen, Li tended to predict the possibility of a Second World War and its impact on the war in the Far East. Li further expressed his opinion that Europe is in great danger of war breaking out in the next two years due to Germany's increasing autocracy, and believes that the handling of the Far East situation by the democracies will have a major effect on European affairs. Li concluded, "I hope that the world can obtain peace, but the democracies need more far-sighted politicians than they currently have." (Reuters special correspondent, 7th dispatch)

Central Memorial Week

### Yu Youren's Report: Congratulations on the Production Conference

(Chongqing) Yu Youren reported on the Central Memorial Week on the 22nd, with the theme "Congratulations on the Production Conference." The main idea was that the flames of the War of Resistance over the past two years have forged the scattered Chinese nation into steel. Production should turn this steel into a huge machine. The recently convened production conference is the motor that starts this huge machine. At the conference, the President's instructions, President Kong's speech, and the suggestions of various experts have already shown us the highest principles and implementation steps for our production and construction. This is the harvest of this production conference. He concluded by saying, "War is cruel, but it is also the mother of culture.

Colonel Hashimoto Declares

### Japan's War in China is Also a War Against Britain; Advocates Forming an Anti-British Alliance with Other Countries Soon

(Tokyo) According to Colonel Hashimoto, who shelled the British gunboat "Ladybird" in the Yangtze River in December 1937, the war Japan is waging in China today is not only a war between Japan and China, but also a war between Japan and Britain. Hashimoto recently returned here from the front lines in China, and told reporters from the Kokumin Shimbun yesterday that Britain, like China, is Japan's enemy. Hashimoto also urged Japan to form an anti-British alliance with other countries as soon as possible to avenge Britain's deep support for the Chongqing government. According to the Kokumin Shimbun, public opinion in Japan advocating the establishment of a military alliance with Germany and Italy is now becoming increasingly powerful.

### German and Italian Foreign Ministers Signed a Political and Military Alliance Treaty Yesterday; The Borders of the Two Countries Will Never Change; Mutual Assistance in Diplomacy and Military Affairs

(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop formally signed the Italo-German political and military treaty in the "Ambassador's Hall" of the State Council at 11:08 this morning. The preamble of the treaty states: "The current borders of Italy and Germany have a fixed nature. The two nations must work together in the future to defend their vital space for survival and maintain peace." The text consists of seven articles:

Article 1: The signatory countries shall maintain regular contact on all matters of common concern to both parties and on the European situation.

Article 2: If the common interests of the signatory countries are threatened, they shall immediately exchange views. If the interests of one signatory country are threatened, the other signatory country shall provide assistance in political diplomacy.

Article 3: If one signatory country encounters war, the other signatory country shall provide full assistance in the sea, land, and air.

Article 4: The signatory countries shall cooperate closely on military and wartime economy, and shall establish two standing committees, each chaired by the foreign ministers of both parties.

Article 5: The signatory countries shall not separately sign peace agreements during wartime.

Article 6: The relationship between the signatory countries and other friendly countries shall be jointly established.

Article 7: This treaty shall take effect from the date of signing for a period of ten years. After the expiry of the term, the validity may be extended. (22nd Havas dispatch)

(Berlin) The signing ceremony of the Italo-German political and military treaty was held in the "Ambassador's Hall" of the State Council. The hall was decorated with many fragrant flowers. Three chairs were placed next to the signing table. Four German civil servants stood in front of the table, each holding the treaty, two copies in Italian and two in German, for a total of four copies. At 11:00 AM sharp, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived at the same time. Leaders of the German military and party departments, senior officials, and diplomatic officials from Italy and Germany, totaling more than one hundred, followed them into the hall. In addition, there were many journalists. At 11:06 AM, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally went to the Head of State's office to welcome Head of State Hitler into the hall. The Head of State sat on the middle chair, with the foreign ministers of Italy and Germany sitting beside him. At 11:10 AM, the signing ceremony was completed. Head of State Hitler looked excited and shook hands happily with Ribbentrop and Ciano, and awarded Ciano the Golden Eagle Medal, the highest medal in Germany. At 11:12 AM, Foreign Minister Ciano took to the wireless radio microphone and gave a broadcast speech, stating that the political and military ties between Italy and Germany have been strengthened by the signing of the treaty. The fate of both sides is as closely related as lips and teeth. This is known to the people of both countries. "Both countries are willing to maintain peace, but are also determined to defend their inalienable right to survival." Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then gave a broadcast speech, stating that Germany and Italy have now become an indivisible group. If the democracies attempt to surround Germany and Italy with treaties that are temporarily suspicious and complex in content, and embark on the road to war, then the Italo-German alliance treaty is the firm answer to them. In the future, no matter what happens, our two countries will be united to deal with it. We are always willing to be friendly with all friendly countries, but we will also jointly defend our vital interests." Head of State Hitler had expressed earlier this month that he wished to conclude a broad political and military treaty with Italy to enhance mutual relations, and the treaty signed today is the natural result of this.

(Berlin) After the signing of the Italo-German political and military treaty, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano held a celebratory banquet at the Italian Embassy at 2:00 PM to entertain Head of State Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. At the end of the banquet, Foreign Minister Ciano, on behalf of his country, presented the "Annunziata Medal" to Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. This medal is the highest honor in the country. Those who are honored with it are entitled to be called brothers of the King of Italy. Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to return to Rome at 11:20 AM tomorrow. (22nd Havas dispatch)

### Japan Has Refused to Join the German-Italian Alliance

(Tokyo) When the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with reporters this morning, the reporters asked one after another about the basic policy decided by the Cabinet on May 20. The spokesperson did not give a definite answer, only saying that Cabinet Secretary-General Ota had issued a statement stating that the opinions of the five ministers were harmonious and that the basic policy for the new European situation had been agreed upon. Beyond this statement, he could say nothing more. When a reporter asked if Japan had notified any foreign government of the policy it had decided on, the spokesperson was unwilling to answer, only saying that Japan was closely watching the European situation. Sensitive observers believe that Japan has refused to join the German-Italian military alliance, but Japan may have agreed to amend the Anti-Comintern Pact to express its sympathy for the German-Italian policy. (22nd Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) The Hochi Shimbun today urged Germany, Italy, and Japan to conclude a mutual assistance treaty, stating that the conclusion of a military alliance between Germany and Italy would greatly contribute to world peace. The five-minister meeting on Saturday and Sunday had agreed on Japan's basic policy towards the new European situation, but it was regrettable that there was no announcement regarding Japan's desire to strengthen the trilateral Anti-Comintern Pact. Germany, Italy, and Japan should urgently conclude a mutual assistance treaty. Only in this way can permanent peace in East Asia be ensured and another world war be prevented from happening. Some parties are deeply concerned that a trilateral mutual assistance treaty will give the democracies unnecessary stimulation. This is really an overestimation. Japan should strengthen and complete its cooperation with Germany and Italy in order to curb the conspiracy of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France to assist the Kuomintang government and attempt to obstruct the establishment of a new order in East Asia.

### Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Have Not Yet Reached Any Agreement; Still Underway in Geneva; Both Sides' Attitudes Are Sincere

(London) Negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union to conclude a defensive alliance are currently underway in Geneva, but according to reliable sources, no decision has yet been made. (22nd Reuters dispatch)

(Geneva) After arriving here this morning, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax immediately held talks with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, which lasted for an hour and a half. The British side then announced that the attitudes of both sides were extremely sincere, and it had been decided to request instructions from their respective governments. This showed that the British and French cabinet ministers had discussed in Paris yesterday and drafted a new proposal to form a compromise plan as the basis for negotiations. It is likely that the governments of Britain and the Soviet Union will not immediately send instructions to Geneva, and that the negotiations will continue in London after Lord Halifax has completed his affairs and the British Cabinet holds a cabinet meeting (this month on the 24th). It can be said with certainty that the two sides will reach an agreement in the shortest possible time. (21st Havas dispatch)

(Geneva) After arriving here, French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky at 10:30 this morning, and then met with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax at 11:30. (22nd Havas dispatch)

Mrs. Roosevelt, the President's mother, and Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih have agreed to serve as honorary chairmen of the special committee. (21st Havas dispatch)

### Border Disputes in Danzig; Poland's Strong Attitude; After Lodging a Serious Protest, National Socialist Party Members Have Dispersed

Warsaw After uniformed stormtroopers rushed into the Bicker tax post, the Polish representative in Danzig lodged a serious protest with the Danzig Senate, stating that if protection for Polish personnel was not guaranteed, Poland would have no choice but to act freely. The Senate then instructed the police to rescue the inspectors at the Bicker tax post. When the police arrived, the members of the National Socialist Party dispersed. (22nd Reuters dispatch)

Warsaw After Polish customs officials at the town of Karlow, Danzig Free City, fled to the town of West Simsdorf on the 20th of this month, it is now heard that the Danzig authorities have agreed to guarantee their safety. The Polish government has also ordered them to return to their customs posts and work with peace of mind. (22nd Havas dispatch)

Warsaw The entire Polish nation has expressed outrage at two consecutive incidents of National Socialist Party members attacking Poles on the Polish-Prussian border within a few hours. After the Polish customs in Garschof was demolished by a group of Germans, uniformed stormtroopers soon rushed into the Polish tax post in Bicker. The inspectors there took refuge in the office and called for help. According to the latest Polish news, the tax post is still under siege. It is said that the stormtroopers who besieged the tax post had previously participated in a National Socialist Party gathering in Danzig. The Polish government has now ordered Polish representative in Danzig Chodacki to demand that the Danzig Senate immediately take all necessary steps to restore the freedom of the Polish tax officials in Bicker. At the same time, the authorities of Germany and Poland have protested against the unexpected incident in Garschof. Later, four Polish railway workers were arrested. Chodacki visited Danzig Senate Chairman Greiser last night to lodge a protest, and Greiser in turn presented Chodacki with a memorandum requesting compensation. It is said that when Polish Deputy Commissioner Perlowski arrived at the scene, the anti-Polish demonstration had ended. At that time, an innocent Danzig citizen named Gruber, who had just returned from Marienburg in East Prussia, was shot and killed just as he got off the car. All circles in Poland claim that the Garschof incident was undoubtedly a provocation, but it cannot be determined whether it originated from the Danzig Senate, the local National Socialist Party, or Germany. It is also said that the five National Socialist Party members who attacked Deputy Commissioner Perlowski's car came from Marienburg in East Prussia. (22nd Reuters dispatch)

Warsaw After the anti-Polish incident in the town of Karlow, Danzig Free City, relations between Germany and Poland have become tense again. The city council and the Polish authorities have recently protested to each other. The city council has asked the Polish government to apologize and hand over the car driver, Moloski, who fired the shots to the city authorities for punishment in accordance with the law. The Polish authorities, on the other hand, have asked the city council to thoroughly investigate the incident and compensate for all damages. Political figures here say that this provocative action by the National Socialist Party in Danzig is intended to force the Polish government to take direct action to protect the lives and property of Polish citizens, in which case Germany can immediately use this as an excuse to take action in Danzig. However, Poland has already seen through its concealment, and on the one hand avoids aggravating the situation, and on the other hand remains determined to maintain all its interests. It will closely monitor traffic at the border between Danzig and Germany to prevent German army troops from sneaking into the city. (21st Havas dispatch)

(Berlin) The German side is extremely angry after the disturbance in the town of Gallof, which borders the Free City of Danzig and the German province of East Prussia, yesterday. According to news received here, a German resident of the city, Gruber, was traveling to the station by car yesterday evening. The street was quiet and empty at the time. He then encountered a car belonging to a Polish diplomat. The driver of the car suddenly fired two shots, killing Gruber. The Chairman of the Danzig City Council, Greiser, has lodged a strong protest with the Polish government, demanding compensation for damages. At the same time, German citizens are extremely angry and have held demonstrations to protest. (21st Havas dispatch)

Warsaw After the anti-Polish disturbance in the town of Karlow, Danzig City, similar incidents have occurred in other towns in the city, especially the town of Piccolo. Upon hearing this, people here are deeply concerned that Germany may take rights that Poland retains over Danzig tax customs (Poland has a tax alliance with Danzig city). Polish government-adjacent persons have all said that all the rights Poland retains must be maintained and that Danzig city’s jurisprudential status must never be subject to any unilateral changes. Although the National Socialist Party uses provocation as an excuse, Poland will never fall into its trap. (21st Havas dispatch)

Warsaw Regarding the anti-Polish incident in the town of Karlow, Danzig City, Poland's senior commissioner in the city, Chodacki, recently protested to the chairman of the city council, Greiser, stating that the city government had recently provided guarantees that it would take necessary measures to ensure the safety of Polish customs officials so that they could perform their duties freely, but that this guarantee had not been fulfilled. "Thereby, the city authorities are unwilling to maintain order, or perhaps do not have the ability to do so, and should bear responsibility for this case. In short, the rights that Poland retains on the tax customs in Danzig will never be limited by faits accomplis. Hereby I request three items: (1) The city authorities should investigate the details of this case and notify Poland of the results of the investigation; (2) The damage suffered by the Polish customs should be compensated; (3) What guarantees can the city authorities provide to the Polish government to maintain order and protect the safety of Poles, given that Polish citizens and civil servants are often attacked. A clear and practical statement should be made immediately." (21st Havas dispatch)

### League of Nations Administrative Council Met Yesterday Afternoon; Former President of Czechoslovakia Files Complaint from the United States

(Geneva) The 105th regular session of the League of Nations Administrative Council opened at noon today. Soviet representative Maisky, the ambassador to Britain, served as chairman. The agenda was immediately adopted and the meeting adjourned at 1:30 PM. The meeting is scheduled to continue at 4:00 PM this afternoon. At that time, Chinese representative Gu Weijun, the ambassador to France, will deliver a speech on the Far East situation, and British representative Halifax will deliver a speech on the Palestine issue. Then, the issue of fortifying the Aaland Islands in the Baltic Sea will be submitted for discussion. (22nd Havas dispatch)

Chicago Former President Benes of Czechoslovakia has telegraphed the League of Nations Secretariat to protest against Germany's occupation of the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia, and Hungary's occupation of the province of Carpatho-Ukraine. He stated that "Our country is now under violent devastation and cannot send a delegation to the League of Nations to file a complaint. I have already telegraphed to Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to make representations on our behalf. In short, the fundamental principles of the League of Nations and the principles of international law have been violated by Germany. The League of Nations must take action to correct this." (22nd Havas dispatch)

(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Halifax met with the League of Nations High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig, Burckhardt, this afternoon to discuss the Danzig issue. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and Finnish Foreign Minister Holsti and Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler discussed the issue of fortifying the Aaland Islands. Regarding this matter, Sweden and Finland have agreed on a method and have concluded an agreement with the signatory countries of the 1921 international treaty (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Britain, France, Italy) to request approval from the League of Nations Administrative Council, but the Soviet Union has not yet approved. (21st Havas dispatch)

(Chongqing) This morning's editorial in the Chongqing United Daily News, entitled "Our Demands to the League of Nations Administrative Council," urged the League of Nations to adopt the following plans: (1) All member states of the League of Nations should uniformly reject Japanese goods; (2) All member states of the League of Nations (3) Restrict exports to Japan, strictly prohibit exports of military supplies, including gasoline and aircraft; (4) In order to effectively stop Japanese aggression and implement sanctions against Japan, the League of Nations should form a special committee composed of countries with special relations with the Far East to discuss effective methods for implementing sanctions.

### 英王在渥太華 演講自由和和平 舉行紀念碑揭幕禮 羅斯福赴英報聘說

Ottawa. When the King of England inaugurated the National War Memorial here today, he delivered a speech that moved all who heard it. He said roughly: There can be no lasting peace without freedom, and no lasting freedom without peace. The archway, surpassed by the armed forces of the entire country, is topped with statues of Peace and Freedom. This is not a coincidence, for peace and freedom cannot be separated for long. Seeing this image in one of the world's capitals reminds people of the greatness of this truth. This memorial is sufficient to represent the spirit of Canada, and it is as if Canada is telling the world its heartfelt thoughts. Its symbolism is extremely appropriate, and its name, "Response," is also well-deserved, for at a glance, it reminds people of Canada's response when world peace was broken and freedom was threatened. Canada sacrificed 60,000 lives for this cause, and those who suffered physical and mental damage were even greater. This memorial is enough to show this to future generations and all nations, etc. The King's speech was clear and composed, and it was the most solemn of the speeches he has made on this trip. People gathered near the memorial at dawn. The King and Queen arrived at 11 o'clock, and before their arrival, cheers were heard from afar, one after another. The memorial was surrounded by guards in red uniforms, holding giant 14-foot-high flags as a guard of honor. When Canadian Prime Minister King respectfully invited the King to perform the ceremony, the guard of honor was divided into left and right columns. The crowd then removed their hats and sang the national anthem together. Then, the King and King together presented wreaths. The King and Queen stood with their subjects for half an hour today, without any sign of fatigue. They also walked around the memorial's pedestal and met with old soldiers and nurses. Then, amidst the crowd's cheers of "We want to see the King and Queen," they walked together to face the people gathered behind the guard line to receive their respects, and finally got into their cars and left. The memorial stands tall on one side of the square, and more than a dozen surrounding houses have been demolished. It faces Elgin Street, which has recently been widened from Parliament Hill South. With the green Laurentian Mountains as a backdrop, it is very magnificent. The monument is made of granite and cost 200,000 pounds. (Reuter's dispatch on the 21st)

(Washington) Today, according to well-informed foreign diplomats here, the government claims that President Roosevelt may go to London later this year to return the visit of the King and Queen of England. The White House's response to this report is inconsistent. State Department officials said they knew nothing about it. However, according to officials, it is customary for the head of a country to visit another country, and the head of that country must also return the visit. The King and Queen may personally invite Mr. and Mrs. Roosevelt to visit London. (Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd)

Madrid. German volunteer soldiers are scheduled to depart for their country in batches between the 24th and 26th of this month. The Spanish authorities will hold a grand ceremony in the city of Leon tomorrow to bid them farewell. At the request of the German government, 150 staff technical personnel will be sent along to visit the German armories. (Havas on the 21st)

Madrid. The German Condor Legion of volunteer soldiers in Spain is scheduled to withdraw and return to their country at noon today. General Franco arrived at the German volunteer headquarters this morning to personally inspect them. The city has been decorated with colorful flowers and decorations. Last night, when a mass farewell meeting was held, the participants reached 80,000 people, which is twice the city's population. (Haitong dispatch on the 22nd)

### 英德曾有 私人談話

(London) European situations are currently being commented on by observers here. The political and military alliance treaty between Germany and Italy is scheduled to be announced tomorrow. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union will then conclude a defense agreement. The confrontation between the two major groups in Europe has thus been determined. As far as the German-Italian axis is concerned, Spain and Japan may not sign military alliance treaties with those countries. As far as the anti-aggression group is concerned, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Poland, and Romania are all included, and their strength is far greater. If Germany and Italy disrupt peace, it is tantamount to suicide. It is hoped that they will understand this and abandon their policy of force. Then, the United Kingdom can still cooperate with them. Foreign Secretary Halifax recently had a private conversation with German Ambassador Dirkson, and it is said that he told him the United Kingdom's position and made five statements: (1) The United Kingdom is determined to complete the security mechanism, and its intention is only to resist aggression and not to encircle Germany. (2) The United Kingdom will resist any attempt to change the European status quo by violence, but it is still willing to submit various current issues for discussion. (3) The agreement between the United Kingdom and Poland remains valid. Poland is resorting to war because of the issue of the city of Danzig, but its government has the right to decide. The United Kingdom still hopes that Germany and Poland will reach a friendly solution. (4) After Germany abolished the Anglo-German Naval Treaty of 1935, the United Kingdom is still willing to negotiate with Germany so that the method of mutually notifying shipbuilding procedures can continue to be implemented. (5) The United Kingdom is willing to conduct economic negotiations with Germany, that is, to allow a delegation from the British Industries Confederation to go to Dusseldorf, Germany on June 6 to hold a meeting with representatives of German industry. It is said that Ambassador Dirkson has conveyed the above views to the German government. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)

### 國際反侵略 中國分會 在渝開常年大會

(Chongqing) The China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement Conference held its second annual meeting in Chongqing on the 21st. Hundreds of representatives from various branch associations, members, representatives of party and government organs, and guests from various groups attended. The situation was enthusiastic and tense. First, Shao Lizi, the chairman of the presidium of the conference, reported in great detail on the development of the international anti-aggression movement over the past year and the great contribution of our country's heroic resistance against Japan to the anti-aggression movement. Then, the training speech of Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang, and the congratulatory telegram from Li Shizeng, the chairman of the standing delegation of the association stationed abroad, were read. (Chairman Chiang's training speech has been published in yesterday's newspaper.) After the reading, representatives from various organs delivered speeches one after another. Then, proposals and the conference declaration were discussed, and Ding Weifen, Yu Youren and others were elected as the 101 honorary chairmen of the second session, Song Qingling as the chairman of the honorary presidium, and Song Ziwen and Shao Lizi as the president and vice president of the second session. Finally, the conference passed a resolution to request the general association to step up its work in aiding China and curbing Japan, and to urge the League of Nations to implement sanctions against Japan. (Dispatch on the 22nd)

(Guilin) The Guilin Branch of the Anti-Aggression League sent a telegram to the China Branch in Chongqing on the 22nd, which was forwarded to the Geneva General Association, stating that Japan's invasion of our country will soon be two years. Recently, due to military failures, it has repeatedly bombed large urban areas in Chongqing, which is utterly inhumane. In order to strive for national independence and national freedom, we should resist to the end in order to win the final victory. However, world peace cannot be divided. If the Far East issue is not resolved in one day, then world peace will never be achieved. The Council of the League of Nations previously passed a resolution applying for individual assistance to China from various member states, but no effective results have been seen. For this reason, we intend to request that the current meeting of the International Council of Administration establish a necessary mechanism and take practical measures. In addition, the collective security system must include the Far East in order to effectively exert pressure on Japan and stop its aggression in order to seek peace in the Far East and seek world welfare.

### 德飛機自行起飛 觸及機棚爆炸起火

(Berlin) A major accident occurred yesterday at the Hijing Aircraft Factory in Nanquelsdorf Town, Berlin, which is the largest experimental aircraft field in Europe, causing the aircraft hangar to catch fire. The reason was that a flight trainee had just completed his solo flight and wanted to hand the plane over to another trainee, so the engine was not stopped. Unexpectedly, as soon as the trainee exited the plane, the plane took off by itself, flew over the airfield, hit the aircraft hangar, and exploded, causing all the newly built planes parked in the hangar to be destroyed by fire. The amount of loss is extremely alarming. (Haitong dispatch on the 22nd)

### 歐局近頃的經緯

— 叔棣

—捷克滅亡以來— (European Correspondence)

From the perspective of the destiny of the entire human race, an unprecedented and very terrible situation is now right in front of us. What is involved is not only the interests of various countries, but the life and death of each other's systems; it is not only the issue of several countries and nations within a certain part of the earth, but the common issue of all mankind in the whole world. If this great war breaks out, then what will be used to fight each other is (to put it exaggeratedly) all the achievements created by mankind since the dawn of civilization; and what will be produced by this great war is (to put it profoundly) the entire future of human civilization. Now, China is bravely resisting and sacrificing heroically. The Czech Republic and Albania are gone. The United Kingdom still wants to make a final struggle for the survival of its aging empire. Japan, Germany, and Italy are still dreaming, wanting to use violence to drag the twentieth century back to the era of colonial expansion by imperialists before the nineteenth century. The only ones who are relatively happy are the United States and the Soviet Union, but on the other hand, the burden on these two countries is heavier than on any other country. In essence, however, the common problem of all countries is only one.

Is the above nonsense? In my opinion, absolutely not. My intention is to remind readers a little before describing the recent situation in Europe; that is, what is the real meaning of the current European crisis?

We, who have witnessed all the processes in the prelude to this major event, sometimes feel extremely nervous; and when we think of China's bright future, we feel unspeakable excitement. In the country, from the daily newspapers, through the world's telecommunications, everyone can see many developments regarding the European situation; however, there are omissions, and there are also rumors with ulterior motives. In Europe, needless to say, it is especially full of rumors, distortions, and propaganda everywhere. How can one correctly judge the situation? This is indeed not an easy task. However, our minimum guideline is: 1. We are Chinese people of the twentieth century, who account for one-fifth of the total human population. 2. Therefore, we firmly stand on the side of progress.

Now, I will describe the evolution of several major crises that Germany and Italy have created in Europe since the demise of the Czech Republic, and which are currently being forged.

The Czech Republic is Destroyed

It didn't take 24 hours for Hitler to swallow an independent country. However, this was not something that surprised the authorities of various European countries. Everyone knows that the several German armies that attacked the Czech Republic this time were already prepared long before September of last year. If there had been no "Munich Conference," according to what Hitler told the authorities of various countries—including the United Kingdom and France—he would have already planned to do so. In fact, the "Munich Conference" completely disarmed the Czech Republic, putting it in a predicament equal to having no national defense. Therefore, in the United Kingdom, there has been such a catchphrase since then: "The Czech Republic? Hmph, it is now a province of Germany!" Therefore, the focus of the problem lies in: After the United Kingdom and France had peacefully acquiesced to the Czech Republic being a German territory, why, at this time, did Hitler take this straightforward approach?

A direct answer to this question is easy to find: For the expansion of armaments by the United Kingdom and France, for the failure of Dr. Schacht's economic negotiations with the United Kingdom, and for the exhaustion of Germany's resources; therefore, Germany had to take coercive measures, seize the Czech Republic's military equipment and resources in one fell swoop, and incorporate them into the so-called "Four-Year Plan" of crazy preparations for war. According to general estimates, the ready-made weapons Germany obtained from this decision are equivalent to the total output of the United Kingdom's current military industry for eighteen months! As for other resources and means of production, they are so large that they cannot even be estimated.

However, compared to this question, there is an even more important question: What is Germany's direction after occupying the Czech Republic—eastward or westward?

At that time, two schools of thought arose in the United Kingdom and France. One school believed that this was a signal of Germany's eastward advance," and what they meant by "eastward advance" was seizing the Soviet Union's Ukraine. The other school of thought believed that Germany was actually seizing various resources in the east and stabilizing the rear, then turning around and concluding something similar to a non-aggression treaty with Poland, isolating Soviet Russia; then, joining forces with Italy to demand a redistribution of the world from the United Kingdom and France. Because of the difference in these two views, great controversy arose in the United Kingdom and France over the issue of Hitler issuing an "ultimatum" to Romania. Especially in the United Kingdom, the so-called "eastward advance" view, led by the current Finance Minister Simon, stubbornly argued that the United Kingdom should not interfere. In their view, it was necessary for Germany to attack the Soviet Union and invade Romania. Otherwise, they asked rhetorically, "How do you expect Hitler to attack the Soviet Union if he doesn't have a common border with the Soviet Union?" Therefore, they argued that the United Kingdom and France's defense line against Germany should be in Turkey: West of Turkey, Germany and Italy could act arbitrarily: If they entered the territory, the United Kingdom and France would begin to resist: Otherwise, Germany and Italy might seize India and Egypt! However, the so-called "westward advance" view, led by the current Foreign Secretary Halifax, felt that the former plan was very risky; because the main commodity for launching a war now is oil, and the United Kingdom's best trick for fighting against Germany is actually the blockade of food: If Germany and Italy obtain all the oil and food of the Balkan countries, then what means do the United Kingdom and France have to bring Germany and Italy to their death?

Needless to say, the latter view held an overwhelming advantage in the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union's attitude had just become particularly taciturn. In addition, people inside Germany represented by Goering who advocated a German-Soviet understanding were active, which further prompted the British authorities to be even more vigilant. On this point, they had to recall that Japan's proposal to Germany in February to launch an attack on the Soviet Union first was rejected. At that time, Japan felt that the war in China was hopeless and proposed to Germany to unite first and overthrow this "red country that is the root of world unrest!" But Germany's answer was: No!

All of this led the current British government to make the greatest determination. The first step in that determination was to guarantee the integrity of Poland's territorial sovereignty and sign a mutual assistance agreement. The second step was to guarantee the independence of Romania and Greece. In this way, the hope of further understanding between Germany and Poland was cut off; and if Germany turned around and attacked the United Kingdom and France, Poland would immediately have the obligation to respond to the United Kingdom's attack on Germany in the east; it would be childish to think that the Soviet Union could stand by and do nothing in a German-Polish war. Therefore, in this way, the British authorities calculated that they could actually pull the Soviet Union in. Therefore, the success of the Anglo-Polish mutual assistance agreement was actually a great achievement of the current British government; compared to Poland, this agreement had even greater benefits for the United Kingdom.

Germany, facing this situation, was absolutely unwilling not to respond. Thus—

(I) Albania is Destroyed

This small country with a population of only over 800,000 was actually already equal to Italy's dependency. The greatest purpose of this formal annexation was to strike first, taking advantage of the United Kingdom and France's unstable foothold in the Balkans. In this way, it surrounded Yugoslavia on one side and threatened Greece on the other. Mussolini executed this plan, but Hitler was its initiator. With Greece and Romania, they could have the entire Balkan Peninsula. At this time, a large number of British and French warships immediately concentrated near Greece. If Italy approached Greece, judging from the determination of the United Kingdom and France at that time, they would not hesitate to fight Germany and Italy in order to ensure traffic in the Mediterranean. Here, Germany and Italy were blocked head-on.

Thus, Hitler was again planning his other response; this is—

(III) The Free City of Danzig

Hitler's original preparation was to occupy the Free City of Danzig on April 29, as a gift for his fiftieth birthday!

The person who participated in the planning of this plan the most beforehand was the current German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. According to his and Hitler's plan, they intended to present several demands to Poland in the manner of an "ultimatum" (these items were later leaked, and the domestic newspapers have probably already published them.) As a condition of exchange, they were to conclude a so-called "Twenty-Five Year Non-Aggression Treaty"; they believed that Poland, which already had a mutual assistance agreement with the United Kingdom, would now definitely reject it. Once this was rejected, Germany could immediately occupy Danzig with justification. If Poland tried to interfere, then the British government would definitely automatically dissuade it. The "British expert" Ribbentrop was famous for believing that the United Kingdom would never be willing to fight for a city like Danzig; therefore, tracing back, he must have also dissuaded Poland.

Whether this estimate is correct (personally, I think it is quite accurate.) cannot be verified now because it has not been implemented. However, it is worth noting that its plan was shelved halfway. This reason came from Rome.

Hitler knew that he could absolutely not accomplish his occupation of Danzig by relying solely on words and verbal threats. As an accompanying step, he calculated on staging a large-scale show of force. On this point, he requested Italy's cooperation. However, to his surprise, Mussolini showed an unwillingness attitude. Italy's current focus is on some other places. (Any place, but especially not Danzig.) His hint was that if Hitler went to occupy Danzig, then Germany would have to deal with it alone.

In this way, the plan was temporarily shelved, and Hitler did not receive his ninetieth birthday gift on April 29.

Also at the same time as the above plan, but currently being intensified, as a response to the Anglo-French-Soviet military alliance negotiations, Hitler also has another plan;

(IV) The Near East and Africa

Everyone knows that General Brauchitsch, the most important figure in the German military, is currently in Rome; his final destination is Tripoli in Italian Africa. His greatest mission this time is to convey Hitler's advice to Mussolini to abandon his intention to attack Tunisia. As for Mussolini's ambition, it has been openly pursued for a long time, and there is no doubt about it. However, according to the opinion of the German military, the military preparations that France has made in Tunisia have actually reached their highest point. Attacking it would be very difficult. Therefore, it is very possible to fake the truth and cause a great war. In order to achieve greater results, simply threatening or planning would be much more certain for Egypt than for Tunisia. The quality and quantity of British military preparations in Egypt are generally far behind the French army in Tunisia.

To divert British attention from Central Europe, the most effective move is to threaten Egypt and then threaten the Suez Canal. This is the consistent view of Nazi strategists.

Now, judging from the information that is already known, the Italian army, which was probably already concentrated on the Tunisian border, has begun to move towards the Egyptian border. The British response is to quickly accelerate the resolution of the Palestine issue.

According to the views of the German and Italian military, if the United Kingdom is unwilling to show weakness and also resists in Egypt, then, before long, Germany and Italy can occupy the territory from Libya all the way to Abyssinia, and through the British-Egyptian Sudan, create a large encirclement of Egypt. When the issue will be revealed is still uncertain: however, its importance is no less than the current Central and Eastern European issues.

Among these endless conspiracies and territorial expansion plans of Germany and Italy against the United Kingdom and France, the most recent and most dangerous, and the most noteworthy place, is

(V) The Strait of Gibraltar

Spain has become a possession of Germany and Italy, and the Spanish coast has now been turned into a fortress of Germany and Italy. All of this was expected. But at the moment, Germany and Italy have not forgotten to use a puppet.

Now, Germany and Italy are using all their strength to exert great pressure on the Franco government, using him as a puppet to threaten the fatal point of the British sea lanes. This move, in German and Italian terms, is: "Recovering Gibraltar from British forces!" Their plan is for Franco to put forward this slogan on May 15. At the same time, Italy also declared that it absolutely "respects the integrity of Spain." "Integrity" of course includes Gibraltar, which was originally ceded to the United Kingdom by Spain. Franco's own attitude seems to be a little hesitant at the moment; however, under the strong control of Germany and Italy, in the end, there will probably only be one way to obey. (May 5)

### Observations Along the Jingtai Route: The Depressed Market of Taixing and Damaged Bridges on the Highway

Taixian Dispatch: The present "clean land" of northern Jiangsu, centered on Taixian County, makes the journey from Tai to Shanghai extremely difficult. One must take a small Taixing ferry to Taixing, walk to Xin'gang to catch a steamer. A traveler who arrived in Shanghai from Tai yesterday recounted his experiences along the way. The Taixing ferry was very crowded. After the boat set off, the village smoke and trees on both banks receded, evoking a sense of nostalgia for one's hometown. The boat traveled for five hours, arriving at Li Xiuhe, a town under the jurisdiction of Taixing County. Due to shallow water, it stopped there. It was only eighteen miles from the city, a distance easily covered by rickshaw. The road surface was mostly sandy, making for a light and brisk ride. In two hours, they reached the city. The market was depressed and the streets were surprisingly narrow. The ancient tower in the city center was relatively prosperous. The city was three miles long from north to south and five miles wide from east to west. The county government was located in the center of the city. The avenue in front of the government was still magnificent. Canals crisscrossed the city, with freely flowing water. Western-style wooden bridges were built above them. The willow-lined banks and the fragrant bird songs created a refined atmosphere. Taixing city was garrisoned by a standing × Brigade × Regiment. Political training posters were plastered all over the thoroughfares, encouraging the people. The next morning, they hired a small cart to leave the south gate and took the Yangjing Highway to Xin'gang. Along the way, the villages were planted with lush bamboo. Thousands of stalks stood tall, surrounded by sparse bamboo fences. The scene was like a painting. At eleven o'clock, they arrived at Bi Lu, eighteen miles from the city, the first line of defense for the Chinese forces. The market was in good condition, and the residents were calm. Beyond this, the journey became more difficult because the highway bridges had been destroyed by the Chinese army, requiring detours. Eighteen miles further was Zhangqiao Town, where a school was still holding classes as usual, with the sounds of music and singing audible from afar. At this front line of national defense, the continuation of education was truly commendable. Another eighteen miles ahead was Shengcitang, occupied by the Japanese army. The houses in the village were in ruins. The highway had been repaired by the Japanese army. Ten miles further was Baiyitang, where a rural elementary school had been destroyed. Recently, due to guerrilla attacks, the Japanese army had erected bamboo fences on both sides of the highway bridges, leaving only one gate for entry and exit, which was closed at night for defense. There was a puppet township government in the area, with absurd announcements plastered all over the walls, as well as Japanese announcements aimed at preventing highway sabotage. At four o'clock in the afternoon, they followed the highway through Jingjiang City. The Japanese army occupied the city. Along the way, the towns were covered with absurd notices from the puppet magistrate Yuan Luchen and the puppet police chief Tao Mingde. Jias Market had a puppet police sub-bureau, flying a five-colored puppet flag. Most of the bridges along the way had been repaired and named after Sada Yumi. Traveling along this road, the rivers and mountains remained the same, but the situation had completely changed, evoking a profound sense of loss. At five o'clock in the evening, they arrived at Xin'gang and stayed at a small inn. Puppet police came to inspect. The Japanese army had built more than fifty houses in the open space east of the port, housing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers, forming a strategic stronghold with the Japanese army in Jingjiang. Merchant ships entering and exiting were forced to pay taxes. Red pills and white powder were readily available everywhere. Those addicted were everywhere, a sign of this toxic policy turning the world into a ghost town. In the morning, they left Xin'gang, hired a small rowboat, and boarded the Ruihe steamer. After setting sail, small Japanese patrol ships were seen busily moving back and forth in the Yangtze River. At four o'clock that day, they entered the Wusongkou. In the late evening, they landed at the Bund wharf on Beijing Road. After spending a few days in Shanghai taking care of private affairs, they returned to their hometown to continue their hard life.

### An Overview of Secondary Education in China (4): Strict Moral Education, Dedicated Counselors, and Long-Term Registration for War Zone Personnel and Students

Methods of Moral Education

According to the regulations for secondary schools, moral education in secondary schools should be conducted in accordance with China's educational aims and implementation policies, cultivating the national morality of "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace" in young people, as well as developing a spirit of courage and perseverance and habits of discipline. Labor service is also required. The principals and all teachers of secondary schools should be responsible for moral education, lead by example, and adopt group training and individual guidance to educate students in all aspects of their activities inside and outside the classroom. Each secondary school should set up a director of moral education and a moral education committee to oversee moral education matters. However, the key points of moral education are nothing more than methods and personnel. The former should be perfected into a complete system, and the latter should be practically responsible. Therefore, in March of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the Ministry of Education promulgated the Outline for Youth Training, dividing the basic concepts into four types: worldview, national view, state view, and world view. It also defined the goals and implementation points for each type of concept. The training items were divided into five categories: belief, morality, physical fitness, life, and service. The training for each category also had goals and implementation points. As for the training methods, they were divided into daily life and teaching courses. The former, in addition to the latter, which belongs to the curriculum, included small group gatherings, field trips, rural service, relief service, camping training, and inter-provincial travel, so that the outline would be clear and complete. In March of the same year, the Ministry also promulgated the Outline for the Counselor System in Schools Above Secondary Level, aiming to eliminate the increasingly distant and commercialized relationship between teachers and students. According to this system, each school divided the students in each grade into several groups, with each group limited to fifteen people. Each group was assigned a counselor, who was a full-time teacher, to closely observe and strictly guide the students' thoughts, behaviors, studies, and physical and mental health, taking into account their individual characteristics. The counselor should report the students' character, thoughts, and studies to their parents and hold a counselor meeting once a month to discuss progress. When students graduated, the counselor should issue a certificate to prove their character. In the same month, the Ministry of Education issued instructions on the points to be noted in implementing the counselor system, instructing all schools to carefully select counselors to ensure that they could practically bear the responsibility of counselors.

Teacher Certification and Professional Development

In May of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the Ministry of Education promulgated the Provisional Regulations for the Certification of Teachers in Secondary Schools and Normal Schools, which were divided into two types: examination certification and new examination certification. Teachers should participate in the appropriate type of certification based on their qualifications. At the same time, the organizational regulations for the review committee were promulgated to ensure that matters were handled carefully. Most provinces decided to implement this. There were regulations for the certification of civic education and moral education leaders, and all provinces followed them without exception. Starting in the 16th year (1927), normal colleges had already begun to hold certifications, and the Ministry ordered all provinces to continue to expedite the certification process. Four years later, new teachers hired by secondary schools who had not graduated from normal colleges or passed the certification were generally not allowed to be appointed.

Regarding teacher professional development, in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the Ministry of Education promulgated the Outline of Measures for Research Associations for Secondary and Normal Education in Provinces and Cities, defining the scope of group research and the categories of research questions to be raised. In the 24th and 26th years, the Ministry issued examples of research questions to promote the regular professional development of teachers. Regarding the methods of lectures and discussions, the Ministry, starting in the 24th year, ordered the promulgation of measures for summer practice discussions for teachers of various subjects in secondary schools, and held four consecutive sessions. In the second session, designated universities and provincial education departments were responsible for the organization, with the responsibility leaning towards the universities. In the second session, the provincial education departments and universities were jointly responsible. After the third session, the responsibility leaned towards the provincial education departments. However, the fourth session in the 27th year was not held in most provinces due to the war. Only the four provinces of Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan held it. The work items of this training course included spiritual lectures, physical activities, academic lectures, discussions on educational issues, and subject-specific teaching methods. In past training courses, those who passed the examination were exempted from taking an examination in a certain subject when participating in the examination certification.

### Educational Supervision of Secondary Education Nationwide

Educational supervision is usually carried out annually by the Ministry of Education. During wartime, close supervision should be strengthened. In May of the 27th year (1938), the Ministry sent ten inspectors to inspect secondary education in the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, starting from Wuhan. Based on their reports, the provinces were ordered to make improvements. In December of the same year, personnel were sent again to inspect secondary education in the three provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan for a longer period of time in order to understand the truth and find ways to improve it. At the National Education Conference in March of this year, it was also approved that each province should divide the entire province into several supervisory districts. In the future, the supervisory system will be implemented more actively.

Compilation of Textbooks

Textbooks for secondary schools have always been required to be reviewed before they can be adopted. After the war, the Ministry of Education realized that the content of various textbooks was either lacking in special teaching materials or did not meet the needs of the times. Therefore, forty reviewers and editors were recruited in Wuhan to conduct a general review of various textbooks on the market. Any teaching materials that needed to be added were added by the editors as supplementary teaching materials. In addition, the textbook system has always adopted a review system. Although it had been felt for several years that it was necessary for the Ministry to compile textbooks itself, and the compilation of textbooks for subjects such as civics, Chinese, history, and geography had begun, it had not yet been completed. Therefore, the Textbook Editorial Committee for Primary and Secondary Schools was reorganized, and experts were hired to actively carry out the compilation work.

Relief for Personnel and Students

In order to provide relief for secondary school personnel and students who had withdrawn from the war zone, the Ministry of Education established ten national secondary schools in various provinces starting in the 26th year (1937): "Henan Secondary School" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Jiangsu; "Sichuan Secondary School" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Jiangsu; "Guizhou Secondary School" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui; "Shaanxi Secondary School" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shandong; "Hubei Secondary School" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Shandong; "Shanxi Secondary School" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Shanxi; "Gansu First and Second Secondary Schools" for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Henan; and Anhui First and Second Secondary Schools for personnel and students who had withdrawn from Anhui. Most of these secondary schools took in secondary school students, followed by normal school students, and some also took in vocational students. Most students were provided with food and lodging by the schools, as well as uniforms. The salaries of teachers and staff were not very different, averaging fifty yuan per month. After the war entered its second phase last autumn, Hubei Secondary School moved to northern Sichuan, and Henan Secondary School moved to southern Shaanxi.

The second method of providing relief for personnel and students was to establish service groups for primary and secondary school teachers in the war zone in various provinces. Eight service groups have been established in the seven provinces of Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Hubei, Gansu, and Hunan to take in teachers and staff and promote free education and mass education in the local area. At the same time, middle school classes, Zhongshan Middle School classes, middle school tutoring classes, and short-term vocational training classes were offered to take in students from various secondary schools.

The third method of providing relief for teachers and staff was for the education departments of various provinces to conduct long-term registration of teachers and staff in the war zone, report them to the Ministry for review, and then assign them to serve in the provinces after they had been reviewed and approved. Their living expenses were paid by the Ministry.

The third method of providing relief for students was for the Ministry to order the education departments of various provinces to conduct long-term registration, assign them to various public and private schools in the provinces nearby. The principle for the treatment of these students was that they should not pay tuition fees. As for food expenses, one-third could be completely waived, one-third could be waived by half, and the remaining one-third had to be paid.

Teacher Adjustment

The Ministry of Education has ordered the education departments of various provinces to separately gather secondary school teachers in the schools who are unqualified or have poor performance and provide them with a longer period of professional development training, and then assign them to serve in the war zone teacher service groups or in various provinces. Their courses will still be taught by members of the service groups until the training period expires, the performance is evaluated as qualified, and the trained members return to their original positions. In this way, by drawing out teachers in batches, it will not be difficult to universally adjust the faculty of the entire province. In addition, Yunnan Province lacks teachers in science subjects. The Ministry of Education and the Yunnan Provincial Government have agreed to select more than forty teachers in subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, physical education, and scouting from the service groups in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces and send them to teach in various schools in Yunnan Province. Their salaries and travel expenses will be paid by the Ministry. (End)

### The Davis Cup Doubles Match Experienced a Dispute and Appealed to the General Association; London Advised the Parties to Resolve it Amicably; Ultimately, Germany Won the Doubles Match

(Warsaw, 21st, Havas Telegram) In today's Davis Cup doubles match between Polish and German tennis players, the German team of Henkel and Metaxa defeated the Polish team of Heida and Bajorowski by a score of 5-7, 7-6, 6-4, 6-2, giving Germany a 2-1 lead overall. A dispute arose during the doubles match. The reason was that the last singles match the day before was not completed until yesterday. According to the original schedule, the doubles match should have followed immediately. However, because the German player Henkel had just finished the singles match and had to play in the doubles match, he was concerned that he would not have enough strength and requested that Menzel replace him. The Polish team agreed to do so. However, the German team then requested that the doubles match be postponed to today and that Henkel still play. The Polish team captain immediately protested and said that if the German team did not field Metaxa and Menzel, they should forfeit the match. The two sides argued and refused to yield to each other and appealed to the Davis Cup Committee in London. Although the committee believed that the Polish team was in the right, it advised both sides to resolve the matter amicably. In the end, the Polish team agreed to hold the doubles match today and allow Henkel to play.

### Frequent Victory Reports from Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou; Chinese Army Begins General Offensive; Chinese Independent 5th Brigade Captures Liuhe Pagoda; Rumor that Chinese Army Has Breached Fuyang East Gate

Tang Shengzhi Arrives in Zhejiang on Foot to Inspect the Eastern Battlefield

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Since the Chinese army on the Eastern Battlefield began its general offensive, victory reports have been frequent. The recent three-day battle situation is recorded below:

Hangzhou's Suburbs Under Siege

Japanese defense positions at Zhakou, Hangzhou, were attacked by the Chinese Independent 5th Brigade on the evening of the 19th. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army immediately relied on fortifications and stubbornly resisted repeatedly. The two sides fought fiercely until the next morning, when the Chinese army, with air cover, managed to capture strongholds in the Liuhe Pagoda area and is now advancing towards Hangzhou City in victory. The Japanese stronghold in Sandun Town in the suburbs of Hangzhou was captured by the Chinese army on the 17th. The Japanese army in that area has been completely eliminated. The Chinese army in the suburbs of Yuhang approached the city directly on the 18th. It is said that the Japanese soldiers entrenched in the city number only one or two hundred, so they did not dare to resist stubbornly. In addition to tightly closing the city gates and defending, they telegraphed the Japanese special service agency in Hangzhou to find ways to reinforce them. However, roads and other transportation routes have been cut off by the Chinese army, so the Japanese reinforcements cannot rush to their aid. It is expected that the city can be captured soon. The Chinese army in Fuyang launched a three-pronged attack on the city on the morning of the 19th. It is rumored that the East Gate has been breached by the Chinese army, and fierce street fighting is now taking place. On the morning of the 22nd, the Chinese army near the Xiejiao Town area along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line was preparing to attack the town when they encountered the Japanese army. The two sides then engaged in a fierce battle. As of the reporter's writing, no news of victory or defeat has been received. The Chinese army in the Sanbao area of Haining was attacked by the Japanese army on the 20th, resulting in the Japanese army being surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese side.

Rail Tracks Near Xiashi Completely Destroyed

Over the past three days, the Chinese army in the suburbs of Jiaxing has advanced towards the city along several routes. It is said that the eastern route has reached Jiaolijie, the southern route has reached near Wulong Bridge, and the western route has advanced from Xinsheng towards Sanliqiao. Yang'aidun (local name) has been officially recovered. In addition to capturing Santawan on the western route, they have now advanced to Xili Bridge. Therefore, gunshots and artillery fire are heard frequently in Jiaxing city, and the residents are panicked. The Chinese army in Huangwan and other places in Haiyan is now surrounding and severely attacking the Japanese army entrenched in the town, and they will soon be eliminated. Regarding the Chinese army in the Wangdian area, in addition to removing the rail screws a week ago, overturning four Japanese troop trains, and completely annihilating the Japanese soldiers, yesterday (the 20th), the Chinese army completely dismantled the rail tracks from Wangdian to near Xiashi, causing the first train from Hangzhou to Shanghai yesterday (the 20th) to be blocked in Xiashi until around 3 pm before repairs were completed. On the evening of the 17th, the Mao unit of the Chinese army vigorously attacked the No. 13 signal station along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese railway guards. However, as a result, all thirty-one Japanese soldiers were annihilated by the Chinese side. The Chinese 45th Brigade in Pinghu attacked the city the night before last, engaging in a fierce battle near the West Gate. As a result, the Japanese army could not withstand the attack and retreated into the city, so the situation in the city has become tense again. The Chinese army positions in Guangchen and Sanhe in the suburbs of Pinghu were attacked by the Japanese army from Zhujing, Pinghu, Jinshanwei, Jinsiniang Bridge, Jiashan, and other places on the 19th. The regular Chinese army in the area divided up to block the attacks, and the battle situation was fierce. The Chinese army positions in Zhongdai were also attacked by the Japanese army a few days ago and were immediately repelled. The Japanese soldiers attacking from the Jin Yaoting area have all been eliminated as of yesterday.

Chongde County Town Has Been Recovered

The Chinese army in the suburbs of Huzhou is also extremely active, so the Japanese soldiers in the city are extremely frightened. It is learned that the Chinese army in the Deqing area attacked the city the night before last, resulting in many enemy casualties. This morning (the 22nd), the Chinese army attacked the Japanese barracks guarding Shimenwan, but the result is unknown. Chongde County Town was captured by the Chinese army a few days ago. When the Chinese army rushed into the city, the puppet magistrate Wang and his staff fled in a chaotic situation. However, Wang's brother was unable to escape and was captured by the Chinese side and immediately executed. The Japanese army in Shanlian, Linghu, Lianshi, Wuzhen, and other places has been completely eliminated in a week. Tongxiang County Town was recently captured by the Chinese army, but temporarily evacuated due to strategic reasons, so the city is again occupied by the Japanese army, but they dare not go out, and the Chinese army is still surrounding the city with all its strength, hoping to annihilate the Japanese soldiers. All bridges on the Hangshan Highway, Jia Ping Road, and other places have been completely burned down in the past three days, so the Japanese troops' communication has been cut off. The Chinese army in Yuanzhen continues to attack the Japanese camp in Nanzha of the town for the past two days.

### The National Government Implements Strict Controls to Strengthen Foreign Exchange Protection; Strictly Prohibits the Import of Luxury Goods to Reduce Trade Deficit; Implements Resolutions of the Production Conference to Vigorously Seek Permits

Inland Sales of Goods Requiring Foreign Exchange Settlement Require Permits

The National Government's international trade policy after the war is to restrict the import of luxury goods and encourage the export of domestic goods as much as possible. Since its implementation, it has achieved good results. It is now learned that the National Government authorities are implementing stricter controls on import trade. The National Government believes that during this period of resistance against Japan, trade deficits can weaken the country's strength. The import of luxury goods is still alarmingly high and should be corrected urgently. Therefore, it has ordered the customs to strictly prohibit the import of such goods. At the same time, when merchants purchase foreign goods and apply for foreign exchange, they must choose essential goods before approval. This plan is in accordance with the government's policy of protecting foreign exchange stability. At the same time, the government is now working hard to increase the export of Chinese products such as tung oil, silk, and tea to earn foreign exchange, and to implement the resolutions of the National Production Conference, vigorously seeking self-sufficiency to reduce the need for imports.

Inland Sales of Goods Require Permits

According to the original regulations, goods designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs that require foreign exchange settlement, such as those transported for sale inland, should be handled by the local trade commission branch, which issues a Category B transportation permit before shipment and customs clearance. It is now learned that the Trade Commission has telegraphed to suspend the issuance of this Category B transportation permit. From now on, goods that require foreign exchange settlement and are transported for sale inland should be handled in accordance with the revised regulations for restricting the reporting and transshipment of export goods. The New Voice News Agency reporter has compiled the following regulations:

Regulations for Restricting the Reporting and Transshipment of Export Goods

(1) All export goods, except those exempt from foreign exchange settlement, may not be reported and transshipped from the inland to areas close to the war zone and coastal and border provinces without a "Domestic Sales Permit" issued by the Ministry of Finance. (2) When reporting export goods, the "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate" or "Transportation Permit" (Category A transportation permit) should be verified and released at the customs post at the place of departure or the first customs post passed during transportation. Those without the above-mentioned documents and are not exempt from foreign exchange settlement should all be subject to foreign exchange settlement. (3) For export goods that have a portion sold in non-war zone provinces other than the place of origin, the provincial construction department should estimate the actual quantity needed and send a letter to the Trade Commission for verification and transfer to the Ministry of Finance for approval to issue a "Domestic Sales Permit" before reporting and transshipping. The Ministry of Finance's interpretation of Article 3 of the above regulations is as follows: To apply for a domestic sales permit for goods requiring foreign exchange settlement, the provincial construction department of the province of sale should first estimate the quantity of the above-mentioned goods actually needed in the province within a certain period and send it to the Ministry for approval, and then merchants should apply to the department, which will verify and send it to the Trade Commission for verification and transfer to the Ministry for processing.

### Japanese Army in South Wharf Digs and Buries Weapons and Ammunition

### The Da Mei Bao Incident Has Been Referred to Hull

The Newspaper Asks for Instructions to the U.S. Consul in Shanghai

To Immediately Take the Most Effective Measures

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the English-language Da Mei Evening News, the Chinese-language Da Mei Morning News, and the Da Mei Bao were banned from sale for publishing a Chongqing telegram of President Chiang's instructions to the Production Conference. They have telegraphed U.S. Secretary of State Hull, stating: "The Chinese-language Morning News of this company has been ordered to stop publication by the authorities in the Shanghai Concession for reprinting the speech on economic issues by President Chiang, the leader of the Chinese government recognized by all countries. This record, in terms of words and spirit, does not conflict with American law and foreign policy, but has been punished by the authorities without any legal procedures. The authorities in the concession in this city have dispatched armed police to guard outside the museum and prohibit the distribution of the Morning News. This measure will surely

Favor the Japanese

And jeopardize the leadership in China, sacrifice American rights, and erase American law, which cannot but be protested. Please instruct the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai to take the most effective measures within his power to prevent the Shanghai Concession authorities from conspiring to deprive Americans of the right to be punished without being judged by an American court."

### Strike at British Lanchang Factory; British Troops Land to Protect; Started Due to the Dismissal of One Worker; The Factory Had No Choice But to Suspend Work Temporarily

The China Press reported that the Chinese workers at the British-owned Lanchang Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, went on strike on Saturday and Sunday and could not be controlled at all, and beat a British supervisor. A team of British sailors from the British warship HMS Taku landed at the factory to control the bad situation and prevent the striking workers. After the British sailors landed, the Chinese workers dispersed and returned home. Yesterday (the 21st), it was learned that Lanchang Textile Factory, owned by British Lanchang Dyeing and Printing Co., Ltd., employed

Many Chinese Workers

They decided to strike at nearly 9:30 am on Saturday because a Chinese worker in the motor room was dismissed, took a threatening attitude, and refused to leave the factory, and the situation became bad. In the afternoon, a British supervisor was beaten by workers, injured, and hospitalized. The factory had no way to fully control the strikers, and decided to request protection. A

Team of Sailors

From HMS Taku, accompanied by Thomas from the Japanese Affairs Section of the British Consulate, sailed down and landed at the factory by the waterfront, changing the dangerous situation. An official from the British Consulate told reporters yesterday that, in view of the direct danger to British lives and property, a team of sailors from HMS Taku was sent to land at the textile factory on Saturday night. This move had the effect of restoring order, and the workers soon

Left Quietly

It is heard that the dismissed employee who caused the strike had been warned several times before for neglecting his work and not following instructions. Because it was discovered that he was inciting Chinese workers to strike, he was dismissed. Consultations between the factory owner and the strikers have not yet resolved this dispute. The factory buildings have been sealed off pending the final outcome. It is heard that the factory will no longer employ the dismissed employee because of his poor performance. The British factory owner issued

A Formal Announcement

Stating that at 9:30 am on Saturday, a strike occurred at the Lanchang Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, due to the dismissal of a worker in the motor room. The worker had been warned three times before for neglecting his work and not following instructions. A month ago, he was given a final warning. On Friday, it was discovered that he was inciting workers to strike, so he was dismissed on Saturday. As a result, the workers in the machine room and the power room stopped working. Because the power supply was cut off, all machines

All Stopped

Negotiations have not been successful so far. The factory cannot re-employ the dismissed employee because of his poor performance and has been tolerant. The factory has been forced to seal off pending a more reasonable attitude from the workers. The English-language Da Mei Evening News also reported that the Japanese-run Chinese-language newspaper "Xin Shen Bao" published in Hongkou today (the 22nd) called the strike at the British Lanchang Textile Factory "a manifestation of the rising

Anti-British Sentiment of the Chinese"

And predicted that labor disputes would spread to other British factories in Shanghai. According to the Japanese view, the 2,000 workers in the Lanchang Textile Factory declared a strike to sympathize with worker Gu Jingen, who was "dismissed for complaining to the manager about the abuse of female workers by a Russian clerk." It also claimed that a female worker was walking slowly when leaving the factory and was kicked by the Russian clerk, and Gu was also beaten by the Russian when he tried to stop him. According to unconfirmed

Chinese Sources

The strike at the Lanchang Factory or the start of strikes by workers at other British factories is a sign that the strike was incited by the "Reformed Government" and "Da Min Hui" under Japanese auspices. Earlier Chinese sources claimed that two organizations under the Japanese

Have Been Engaged in Inciting Workers to Strike

And have promised to subsidize Gu's family with 30 yuan per month during the strike and each worker with 15 yuan.

### Japanese Army Posts Notices in Siming Villa Lane; Same Notices in Zhongshi New Village; Prohibiting Anyone from Moving In or Out; The Japanese Side's Intention Seems to be to Collect "Donations" from Residents

The China Press reported that 110 Chinese households in two lanes facing Yu Yuan Road and actually in the "Road" area were surprised on Saturday afternoon when Japanese military police posted notices in the two lanes prohibiting anyone from moving in or out. The two lanes are Zhongshi New Village and the opposite Siming Villa. As far as can be ascertained, Siming Villa is

Owned by Siming Bank

Zhongshi New Village is the property of the China Industrial Bank. Japanese military police reappeared in the two places yesterday morning, presumably to find out if anyone had violated the orders of the previous day. Several Chinese police officers are on duty as usual on Yu Yuan Road outside the two lanes. The purpose of the notices could not be learned from officials. One theory is that the Japanese authorities consider the property to be owned by Chinese banks such as the China Industrial Bank and intend to

Levy Rent

Or confiscate it altogether. Another theory is that the residents of these houses enjoy the public benefits of the Public Concession, and although they have already paid municipal taxes, the "Road" authorities also intend to levy taxes on them. Some evidence of this theory was obtained last night. Reporters asked various officials

About This Situation

None of them could explain it. However, the residents of the buildings in the two places do not seem to be particularly troubled by the notices, because one of the residents told reporters that they could not find a place to live elsewhere.

### Rice Supply Increases and Sources Are Plentiful; Food Supply is Temporarily Not a Concern; Market Chaos Has Subsided Slightly; Rice Merchants Order 2,000 Tons of Foreign Rice; Total Rice in the City is 557,840 Bags

The soybean and rice market has calmed down slightly as the sources of supply from various places have gradually increased. Although the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee has dissolved itself, the set price limit remains in effect. The eighth survey of rice stocks was released yesterday, showing an increase of 4,592 bags from the previous period, for a total of 557,840 bags of rice in the city. Rice merchants have ordered 2,000 tons of foreign rice. The entire food supply of Shanghai City is not expected to be in short supply. Details are recorded in detail below:

Many Call on the Authorities to Control the Market

Since the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee was forced to dissolve itself due to the difficulty of carrying out various tasks, market transactions have been quite chaotic, and rice prices have soared, which has rarely been seen before. In view of this bad phenomenon, various public organizations in this city believe that if a proper solution is not planned early, it will not only increase the burden on citizens, but also affect the food supply of more than 4 million people, which is of great importance to the future. Moreover, in Shanghai after the war, the vitality of various industries has not recovered, and the lives of ordinary people are difficult, but some hoarders disregard the fattening of themselves at the expense of others, and only seek personal gain, manipulating the market and raising prices, which is really unconscionable. Therefore, we urge the authorities of the concession to quickly take strict measures to stop and punish them severely, and to quickly find effective ways to control the market, so that speculators cannot get involved and cannot use their skills.

Rice Stocks Increased by Four Thousand Last Week

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association yesterday that the eighth survey of rice stocks in the city was completed yesterday. The total rice in the city is 551,784 bags, an increase of 4,592 bags from last week. Therefore, the food supply of Shanghai citizens can definitely be assured, and rice-producing areas such as Wuhu, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Changshu are shipping to Shanghai in a steady stream. Yesterday, 45 ships from various routes along the river delivered more than 5,000 bags. The survey of rice stocks will continue to be conducted by the Soybean and Rice Industry Association and will still be conducted once a week.

Accurate Number of Rice Stocks in Eight Surveys

The accurate number of rice stocks in each rice warehouse is as follows: Bank of China 104,708 bags, Bank of Communications 5,429 bags, Zhejiang Industrial Bank East and West Warehouses 92,338 bags, Shanghai First 9,048 bags, Shanghai Second Xiechangde 2,233 bags, Industrial Bank 45,624 bags, Kenye Bank 246 bags, Zhongyi Trust 100 bags, Local Bank 12,468 bags, Jincheng Bank 5,988 bags, Xinhua Bank 25,899 bags, Jiangsu Second 2,790 bags, Donglai Bank 4,370 bags, Zikang 7,163 bags, Hengfeng 1,160 bags, Longmao 23,876 bags, Yuan Yu 125 bags, Yuanxiang 757 bags, Shengfei 1,130 bags, Yongsheng 170 bags, Taikang 345 bags, Dada 2,179 bags, Zhengfeng North and South 1,788 bags, Ruifeng 736 bags, Dafengchang 600 bags, Zhengda 4,229 bags, Dayouyu 4,770 bags, Dade Xinbei 1,434 bags, Gongji 1,017 bags, Hengyigong 40 bags, Runji 1,153 bags, Xinchang 6,670 bags, Dehexing 1,834 bags, Xinyu 6,425 bags, Dade Xinzhong 4,200 bags, Shenghelong 2,751 bags, Chengyi 360 bags, Shengmao 23 bags, Hengda 4,760 bags, Dade Xinnan 3,354 bags, Jutaihe 106 bags, Hengxingyi 89 bags, Jiangnan 2,976 bags, Yixingfeng 3,553 bags, Jiuda 459 bags, Wanchang 1,725 bags, Xinye 1,634 bags, Heji South 334 bags, Yucheng 355 bags, Hengtai 869 bags, Qiada 900 bags, Zhang Xiejun 786 bags, Wansensheng 146 bags, Yusheng 1,015 bags, Wanshengtai 153 bags, Yixin 1,435 bags, Faji 816 bags, Wanshengxing 245 bags, Maotai 30,703 bags, Xiechangde 1,315 bags, Qingshengyi 1,161 bags, Tongshen 3,358 bags, Roosevelt 3,500 bags, Taikoo 3,213 bags, Changyiheng 1,196 bags, Dingtaide 14,807 bags, Anshen Second 1,738 bags, Anshen Third 8,007 bags, Xinfeng 899 bags, Hufeng.

Ordered Foreign Rice Approximately Two Thousand Tons

Because of recent manipulation by hoarders, there are few spot cargoes on the market, and the price of domestic rice has soared. The 15-yuan price limit is only a name. Moreover, the current price of domestic rice is equal to the price of foreign rice. Each rice merchant has ordered a large amount of foreign rice from foreign rice-producing areas such as Annam, India, and Saigon, totaling as many as 2,000 tons, and entrusted Dafu Foreign Firm to handle it. They will be shipped to Shanghai soon to provide relief. Moreover, at the turn of spring and early summer, the weather is gradually getting hotter, and all kinds of rice and grain are difficult to store for a long time, so people's hearts are small.

Market Chaos Slightly Subsided

In the soybean and rice market, the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee dissolved itself. All 105 rice industry firms believed that the price limit of 15 yuan for top-quality white rice had also been cancelled, so they set prices privately and traded with each other. Spot cargoes in the market can meet supply and demand, but the price is higher. Changshu extra-white rice has risen to 245 yuan. The momentum of rising prices for the local rices is also very strong. In the market yesterday morning, as sources from various places gradually increased and the Market Management Committee made every effort to explain that the price limit was still in effect and had not been cancelled, the market situation was calmer and the market price also fell by 35 yuan. A total of 3,500 bags were traded.

### Ningbo Suffers Another Air Raid, Japanese Planes Did Not Drop Bombs, Kangsha, Yide, and Deping Increase Sailings on Shanghai Line, Hana Changes to Wenzhou-Shanghai Line, Ding Line Temporarily Suspended

Since suffering eight major bombings by Japanese planes, Ningbo has recently shown some signs of tranquility, and the situation has tended to ease. All sectors in Ningbo are now handling the aftermath and have established the Ningbo Disaster Relief Committee for Compatriots. A total of 15,000 yuan has been raised to heal the wounded and console the dead, and progress is quite active. According to inquiries from a German shipping company's shipping radio station, there was another air raid alarm in Ningbo at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, which was not lifted until the afternoon. The Japanese planes did not drop bombs. As for the public sentiment, as of 7:00 PM, no telegrams had been received from Ningbo, so there was no way to know.

Foreign Merchants Increase Sailings, Operating to Shanghai

Since the Shanghai-Ningbo route was approved for resumption by the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters, the Moufu Wheel of the German company Lihe Yanghang was the first to resume sailing on the morning of the 20th, and safely entered the port that evening. Now that the ship has finished unloading cargo, it is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ningbo on the 24th. It is learned that the Italian shipping company, Zhongyi Shipping Company, has decided to send ships to increase sailings on the Shanghai-Ningbo line in order to alleviate cargo transportation. In addition to the Kangsha Wheel, which set sail for Ningbo yesterday afternoon, the company's Deping Wheel also returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou yesterday afternoon and is scheduled to sail to Ningbo today. However, if the time is not sufficient, it may be postponed to set sail tomorrow.

Hana Sails to Wenzhou, Shanghai-Ding Line Suspended

After the resumption of the Shanghai-Ding route, the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters designated one Hana Wheel to operate exclusively to maintain transportation. According to news from the Far Eastern Shipping Company, the Hana Wheel left Ding at 8:00 PM yesterday afternoon and will arrive in Shanghai this morning. However, due to the sluggish cargo transportation on the Shanghai-Ding line, it has been decided to change to the Wenzhou route after arriving in Shanghai, and the Shanghai-Ding line will be temporarily suspended. As for the Gaodeng Wheel of the German company Lulin Yanghang, it has already sailed from Ding to Ningbo and the voyage is quite smooth. In the future, it will regularly operate on the Shanghai-Ding line.

Relief Donations Exceed 20,000 Yuan

Since the Ningbo Association in Shanghai entrusted various banks to collect disaster relief donations, compatriots in Shanghai, in view of the tragic disaster in their homeland, have donated enthusiastically. The situation is very enthusiastic. As of yesterday, the total amount has exceeded 20,000 yuan, and it is not difficult to reach the target of 50,000 yuan.

### The Japanese Yen Continues to Fall in Price, 92.3 Yuan in Legal Tender Can Buy 100 Yen in Japanese Gold, Reserve of "Huaxing" Banknotes Suspect

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that on today (the 22nd) the exchange market in Shanghai continued to see the Japanese yen depreciate against the legal tender. Exchange shops on Sichuan Road were buying Japanese yen at a rate of 92.3 yuan in legal tender for 100 yen in Japanese gold, and selling Japanese yen at a rate of 92.7 yuan. It is widely believed that this is the lowest price of the Japanese yen in many years. The official rate in Tokyo is 150 yuan in legal tender for 100 yen in Japanese gold. It is noted that the trend of the Japanese yen's depreciation began at the beginning of last week, when Shanghai shops began to exchange legal tender

at par

with Japanese yen, but since Friday of last week, the Japanese yen has fallen lower than the legal tender in the local market. Today's exchange rate continued to fall compared to last Saturday and Sunday. It is noted that on Saturday and Sunday of last week, exchange shops bought Japanese bank notes for 94.8 yuan in legal tender per 100 yen in Japanese gold, and sold Japanese yen for 95.3 yuan in legal tender. It is pointed out that these exchange rates only apply to Japanese bank notes. The price of Korean bank notes is at least 15 to 20 percent lower. At the same time, money changers in the occupied areas under the jurisdiction of the "Reformed Government" have decided to handle the banknotes of the Huaxing Commercial Bank, which only started

limited circulation

a few days ago, at the "black market exchange rate". 100 yuan in legal tender in Chinese currency requires 160 "Hongkou currency." In other words, the actual price of one yuan of "Hongkou currency" is only slightly more than 0.6 yuan in legal tender. It is heard that the Huaxing Bank intends to circulate 20 million yuan worth of banknotes. According to the current exchange rate, the surface value of 20 million yuan in banknotes is only worth 13.5 million yuan, but this number is still huge, and the bank issuing this banknote, its reserve

is highly suspect

The value of Japanese military scrip in the interior is also unstable, depending on the circumstances of its use. If a team of Japanese people tries to pay for goods with military scrip, they are likely to be accepted at face value. However, if Japanese soldiers or Japanese people use it alone, they may have to offer a discount, and when used by Chinese people, the discount is even greater. It is heard that in villages and towns where the Japanese military presence is less prominent, those who try to force the circulation of military scrip are signing their death warrants.

Starting at 3:00 PM, a farewell ceremony will be held at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha wharf.

### Huang Yuqi and Others Initiate the Organization of the Silver Shop Association

Since the outbreak of the war, silver shops in this city have served the public in response to social needs. In recent years, the industry has flourished and has shown unprecedented development. At present, there are more than 70 large and small silver shops in Shanghai, which not only occupy a considerable force in the local financial community, but have also become a necessary mechanism for regulating funds for small and medium-sized industries and commerce. It is learned that the leaders of the industry, Huang Yuqi, Zhang Renwei, and others, in view of the fact that there is little communication among their colleagues on weekdays, and each is right in their own way, the methods are inevitably different, and the effectiveness has not been fully发挥, have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Silver Shop Industry Association. Yesterday (the 21st) at 7:00 PM, the first inaugural meeting was held at the Huizhong Lianhuan Society on Shilu Road. More than 20 representatives of the main bodies of various silver shops, including Yan Dexiu, Hu Qingchen, Zhang Tongsheng, Ji Xiangqing, Yao Ruilian, Zhou Huili, Fan Shaoliang, and Wang Xifu, attended the meeting. Huang Yuqi was elected chairman, and he immediately reported that the population of this city has increased sharply due to the war. On the one hand, small and medium-sized industries and commerce have shown lopsided and abnormal development. On the other hand, domestic hot money lacks proper channels for utilization. Thanks to the efforts of our silver shop colleagues, we have worked separately to make up for the deficiencies and regulate industry and commerce. In recent years, the rapid development of our industry has met the urgent needs of society. However, in wartime economy, everything depends on cooperation, and our own strength lies in unity. Banks and money shops are guaranteed by industry associations, and their status is becoming more and more stable, and their effectiveness is fully发挥. Only our industry is lacking in this regard. In terms of the industry's prosperity and innovation, the steps are inevitably uneven. In order to promote sincere cooperation and expand the effectiveness of our industry, the organization of an association is a matter of urgency, and so on. Then the discussion began, and the motion to initiate the organization of an industry association was unanimously passed, and Cao Zhigong was hired as Secretary-General, and preparations were actively made from now on. During the meeting, the representatives expressed their opinions and many valuable insights on the current financial situation in this city. After the meeting, Mr. Huang hosted a banquet to promote friendship. It was not until about 10:00 PM that the guests and hosts dispersed happily.

### Confiscation and Transfer of Seized Ships at Songkou

Some of Them Are Used by the Japanese Qing Company

British Merchants Decide to Maintain Routes with All Their Strength

Japanese shipping companies such as the Japanese Qing Company, Dalian Company, Osaka Company, and Japanese Post Company, with the assistance of the Japanese government, are making every effort to expand their shipping business in China, attempting to monopolize everything. The Japanese Navy in China provides convenience for the entry and exit of Japanese ships, so that the Yangtze River middle and lower reaches and North China routes, the ships of third countries have been squeezed and the impact is extremely weakened, while Japanese ships have become more active. In addition, it also prevents ships of third countries from entering inland ports. Some of the third-country ships seized after the war have been released after negotiations with the Japanese by the consuls of the respective countries, while more than 20 ships have not been released, such as the Tangbei Meida Libao and other ships. According to news from the New Sound Agency, some of them have been confiscated, renamed, and transferred to the Japanese Qing Company for use. Therefore, shipowners from various countries have been given close attention by their governments. As for British shipping companies, in order to maintain their original routes in China, they have decided to deal with it with all their strength, and have obtained mutual contact with the British Navy's Far East Fleet to implement self-defense and prevent interference from third parties.

To commemorate this scholarship, he changed his original name "Xian'an" to "Lidun" to show that he would never forget it. During his hard study period, he also suffered the death of his maternal grandmother. His family was also destitute, and he relied on him to run around for three days before he was buried. At the age of nineteen, he was recommended by Feidi Middle School to Shanghai St. John's University, and he was given a full scholarship to dispose of. At the age of twenty-three, he was promoted to the main hall (at that time, St. John's was still called a college), and he was promoted by the Dean to assist the chemistry room with a monthly salary of 15 yuan. At the age of twenty-six, he graduated and returned to Ningbo to serve as the vice principal of Feidi Middle School. He continued to teach in various schools for more than ten years. As we chatted to this point, the reporter was very sympathetic to Mr. Yuan's spirit of hard study, but when I thought about how many ambitious young people have encountered difficulties and cannot continue to go to school since the national crisis, how sad should we be? How heartbroken should we be? It is said that Shanghai can still have books to read, but it is a rare thing to run a good school at the same time without excluding ambitious young people from school due to family economic relations, or even a fantasy. Looking at the past from today, we can't help but sigh. At that time, I showed Mr. Yuan a desire that he would help the powerless students in the current suffering. This silent request, Mr. Yuan also sadly said that he hoped everyone would work together to find a practical way.

Mr. Yuan continued to say in a sad tone about his experience in serving the society. After the restoration of the Republic of China, he served as the Director of Foreign Affairs and Transportation of the Ningbo Military Government. In the second year of the Republic of China, he came to Shanghai and was hired by Cen Yunjie of Xilin to go to Hanzhong to serve as a translator for the Supervisory Office of the Hanyue Sichuan Railway. Later, he returned to Shanghai and served as the assistant to the manager's office of the Commercial Press. He also assisted Xie Hengchuang in running the Dulou Coal Mine and the Shunchang Shipping Company. At the same time, he devoted himself to various charitable organizations and later served as the general manager of the Duoshao Shipping Company. At the successive meetings of Chinese taxpayers, he was elected as a Chinese director of the工部局. Finally, he said, "Because I was born in poverty, I have tasted all kinds of hardships, so I treat people and things with loyalty and forgiveness as the foundation. Over the years, I have spared no effort to find jobs for people and provide guarantees for people, and there has been no year without suffering for others. The total amount of compensation is no less than 100,000 yuan." He believes that only mutual assistance can maintain social cohesion, so he said that even if he loses money, he will not complain.

We have talked for so long, and I think there are many parts of it that are worth reading for young people. Mr. Yuan also said that the Shenbao's contribution to the society is even greater at this time, so I also briefly recorded what he said for the readers. (End)

Scum of Buddhism

### Monk Yingzhao, Adultery with a Young Woman, Sun Yaohuan Leaves Home to Join the Army, The Lecherous Monk Actually Seduces His Wife, The Case is Adjudged to One Year in Prison

Baoben Hall on Mount Putuo in the South China Sea is one of the largest monasteries in the major mountains in the north and south. The current host, Monk Yingzhao, has a wide range of contacts, and his reputation is growing day by day, seemingly becoming the祭酒among monks. In fact, he is also a member of the wine, meat, and sensuality, the 流亚of Haige Li. Now his hypocritical mask of stealing fame and deceiving the world has been揭穿, and he has been sentenced to imprisonment for adultery with a married woman. Because Yingzhao is the host of Baoben Hall in Putuo, he also serves as the host of the Baoben Hall branch in Changsha Road, Public Concession of this city. The association comes to Shanghai from Ningbo every time, then Zhuoxi is here.

Years ago, in Shanghai

there was a wealthy merchant from Fuliang, Mr. Sun, who, because of his admiration for Buddhism, had外交with Ding Fang. In 1935, Sun's commercial operations in Suzhou and Shanghai successively failed, and he returned to Jingde in Ganzhou with鍛羽. However, the old residence was萧然and it was difficult to live, so he brought his son Sun Yaohuan and his daughter-in-law Jiang Meili to Putuo. At that time, Yingzhao saw that an old friend had投, and inquired about the situation, and readily留them. He then took the remaining house on the side of the temple, gave them a eave, so that Sun and his son and daughter-in-law could reunite. The initial intention was not evil. Until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Sun Yaohuan deeply knew that this was a war of national liberation, it was time for young people

to Dedicate Themselves to Serving the Country

He resolutely said goodbye to his new bride Jiang Meili, and entrusted his old father and娇妻to Yingzhao. Until January of this year, when he took a leave from the army and returned to the mountain to visit his relatives, there was only white hair in the hall, and no 红颜resident. When he asked his father, he learned that Jiang had been略诱离山by Yingzhao last winter and遁迹at sea. After hearing this, Yaohuan thought that the monk was his father's Zhizhi, and he had such a beastly act, not only蔑弃Xinyi, but also was a Buddhist scum. So he followed to the孤岛, and repeatedly went to the Baoben Hall Temple on Changsha Road to参谒, but he could not see him. After侦之无踪, it was not until noon the day before yesterday that he

Found Out That the Monk

His wife was hiding on the top floor of No. 48 Wenzhou Road. He immediately reported to the Chengdu Road police station, which ordered Chinese and Western detectives to go to the address for investigation, and the lecherous monk, who was already in his花甲year, was lying on a bed with the艳妇of花信年华, and each was only covered in亵服. He ordered both parties to dress and took them back to the police station for detention separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Zhong Qing opened a trial. Zhang Shizhu, the police station's lawyer, recounted the case, stating that the facts of the old monk's adultery with a young woman were確鉴, and asked that he be punished according to the law. Sun Yaohuan recounted that he had been abducted to Shanghai by the monk

Adultery with His Wife

The经过情was brought to the捕获 by报, and also asked Attorney Zhang Fukang to represent him and request that Yingzhao be severely punished, and for Jiang, he念夫妇之情and begged to be免究. The court interrogated Jiang, who admitted to committing adultery with Yingzhao, starting in October last year, and was subsequently威迫to come to Shanghai and live together in a rented house. However, the defendant Yingzhao饰词推諉, and延律师 Wu Linkun and Yu Hualong辩护. After Judge Zhong finished讯, he sentenced Yingzhao to one year in prison for adultery with a married person, and the part about Jiang Meili was不受理. The monk heard the verdict and still asked for bail, but was驳斥, and was escorted away by the detectives and捕.

### Indulge in Gambling Dens, Embezzlement of Cloth

The Borrowed Money Was Sent to Gambling Dens, Sentenced to Nine Months in Prison

Pan Ronggao, a Shaoxing native, was employed as a staff member in the Hengchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory opened by Qian Jintang at No. 40 Beishan West Road. The cloth dyed by the factory was usually passed through the China Calendering Factory at No. 59 North Wuxi Road for calendaring procedures. Recently, the factory sent 53 pieces of cloth worth more than 900 yuan to the China Factory for calendaring. However, Pan has recently been

Indulging in Gambling Dens

suffered repeated losses, so he had evil intentions. On the 15th of the month, without the order of the factory owner, he went to the China Factory to pick up the goods. The China Factory did not doubt that Pan was indeed a Hengchang staff member, so Pan, after obtaining the goods, pledged these 53 pieces of cloth to the Wanji Pawnshop on Avenier Road, obtaining 600 yuan, and then避不到厂. After Hengchang发觉, he reported to the老闸police station, and detectives Chen Zhihong and Chen Ruisheng侦查, learned that Pan

Was Hiding in Shanghai West

The Fusheng gambling den in Caojiadu. He set up a plan to lure Pan out and arrested him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court刑一庭. Attorney Ru Bao of the police station陈明经过, and prosecuted him for embezzlement of business in accordance with Article 336 of the Criminal Law, and requested that he be punished according to the law. When asked about Pan Ronggao, he also admitted to it, and the money he had obtained was all lost in the gambling dens. After Judge Feng Shide核供, he sentenced Pan Ronggao to nine months in prison on the spot as a warning.

As a result, many books that had already been装钉in the work were全数搜去. Before leaving, several employees of the work were taken to the police station for questioning.

It was also learned that the Public Concession Police Department sent personnel to search various bookstores on Fuzhou Road yesterday morning, which lasted a long time, but as to whether any books and objects were抄获 as a result, it is still无从探悉because the authorities have not announced it.

### Continued Searches in the Two Concessions

The police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, in order to prevent unrest in the concessions and protect public safety, held a large-scale search on the 19th of this month, with remarkable results. The tense situation at that time was also restored to tranquility due to the removal of obstacles that night. However, the authorities of the two concessions have always been unremitting in their defense, and the reserve隊白俄商團are still dispatched all day long, especially paying attention to the border areas, with more stringent precautions. Yesterday, it was heard that large numbers of reserve隊or白俄商團were stationed at various key intersections in all热闹市區, and all pedestrians and vehicles were subjected to strict searches, and they had not撤回帰隊until about 9:00 PM.

### Searching Pedestrians, Copying Toxic Substances

The Chengdu Road police station search team No. 2776, No. 2965, No. 2939 Chinese捕and others奉命to search pedestrians in the concession at 9:15 PM on the 20th of the month. When they checked Dagu Road, they saw two people who were suspicious, so they stopped them and searched them, and on the spot抄获162 packets of heroin drugs, and brought them back to the police station. They learned that the two men were Zhou Wengao and Han Xiang, both from Yangzhou. Attorney Li Zhishan of the police station prosecuted according to Article 4 of the Drug Prohibition Regulations. After a detailed interrogation by Judge Chuan Lin, he ordered the two defendants to be remanded for another hearing, as the case still needed to be investigated.

### Adultery with Wife's Sister Case, Appeal Concluded

Xia Changyu, a native of Wuxi, had a relationship with his wife's sister, Xue Qi, and lived together in Gujialong, Hualong Road, French Concession. His wife, Xia Xuehuaishan, found out and reported to the police station on the morning of the 5th of last month. Xia Changyu and Xue Qi were arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for public prosecution for obstructing family. In the first instance, they were each sentenced to four months in prison and detained in the detention center awaiting verification during the appeal period. Later, because Xia and others refused to accept the verdict, they entrusted Attorney Wang Shizong to file an appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court and requested bail from the original trial court, which was驳斥. The collegial panel of the Third Branch of the High Court tried the case and declared the end, and scheduled the verdict. The appellants each submitted a store guarantee of 100 yuan to show the case. Later, because the judge handling the case thought that the case was not clear and needed to be investigated in detail, he撤消辩论终结. Yesterday afternoon, Chief Judge Wu Tingqi, together with Judges He and Gu, and Prosecutor Zhao, came to the刑二庭to reopen the辩论审理. According to the appellants Xia Changyu and Xue Qi, they began to live together in 1936. When Suzhou and Wuxi fell last year, they fled with Xia Xuehuaishan. Xia Xuehuaishan had long known that we were living together. The plaintiff Xia Xuehuaishan firmly stated that she did not know that they were living together until mid-November last year. She劝止was invalid, so she reported to the police station. Attorney Wang Shizong and others for the appellants辩论that this case is a crime of accusation, and the statute of limitations for the accusation has passed 16 months, and requested that the original verdict be废弃and declared无罪. As a result, the court ruled that the辩论is终结and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 26th. The appellants each added a written guarantee of 100 yuan to await verification.

### Son of a Compardor Accused of Seduction and Abandonment, Along with a Civil Suit Requesting Alimony; Defendant's Address Unknown, Awaiting Further Summons

Tong Benhou, son of Tong Longshan, a compradore for the Asiatic Petroleum Company, also known as Tong Weizhi, formerly studied at the Zhenjiang Runshang School. Recently, a fellow townsman, Madam Cha Liu, along with her daughter Cha Peilin (20 years old this year, formerly a student at Zhenjiang Dunben Girls' School), retained lawyer Zhang Danping to represent them in filing a private prosecution with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division. The lawsuit alleges enticement away from family, causing her to submit to lewdness and abandonment, requesting legal action, along with an attached civil suit. It is claimed that the defendant and Peilin met at a sports event last October. The defendant allegedly enticed the woman away from her family, and they cohabited at 81 Jin Shenfu Road. It is further stated that his father, Tong Longshan, has a prominent reputation in the business community, and he vowed to form a lifelong bond with Peilin. Peilin, young and ignorant, was seduced and lost her virginity. However, after achieving his goal, the defendant gradually became cold and abandoned her. In addition to requesting investigation for the crime under Article 241, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, the plaintiffs also request the court to order the defendant to pay Peilin's living expenses of 40 yuan per month until she reaches the age of 60, totaling 20,160 yuan. According to the complaint, the court, yesterday at 2:30 PM, held a hearing presided over by Judge Zhang Minsheng.

Since the defendant cannot be summoned, the case is temporarily suspended pending the defendant's summons for further questioning.

### Two Suspects in the Murder of Detective Li Liansheng Case Under Investigation

Li Liansheng, a resident of 13, Yu Xiang Lane, 987 Xiafei Road, Nanjing, also known as "Pockmarked" Li Liansheng, was formerly a detective in the French Concession's anti-gambling squad. After his retirement, he was unemployed. On the morning of April 23rd of last year, at 6:30 AM, two thugs suddenly broke into Li's bedroom, armed with handguns and axes, and hacked Li to death in his bed. The murderers immediately fled. Afterward, the French police reported the case to the court for a coroner's examination, and the family arranged for the funeral. Meanwhile, the police were ordered to arrest the murderers. It is now learned that two bandits, who were sentenced to imprisonment by the First Special Court and are serving their sentences in Tilanqiao Prison, confessed that they had also committed the murder of Li Liansheng in the French Concession. The French police have dispatched detectives to bring the two bandits back for interrogation. It is reported that the two bandits were taken to Li's residence and ordered to reenact the murder. At the same time, the police are investigating the mastermind who is still at large, and will bring him to justice for interrogation. As for the two suspects who confessed, it is said that after the investigation is completed, they will be handed over to the court for legal prosecution.

### Gambling Dens Accept Nickel Coins

For the Convenience of Bets

The English "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reports that as a result of the active gambling dens in the "badlands" of Shanghai's western district, there is a severe shortage of nickel coins in Shanghai. Smaller gambling dens in the "badlands" all use one yuan as the minimum bet. For the sake of "convenience," they prefer to use nickel coins rather than paper money, because it is easier to stack nickel coins to pay out bets than to check paper money. As a result, the exchange rate for nickel coins in Shanghai's exchange shops, which was previously only a discount of one cent per yuan, is now as high as four or five cents. In other words, one yuan can only be exchanged for 96 cents.

Yesterday afternoon at around 12:00 PM, Li suddenly swallowed sleeping pills at his residence at 25 Yu Qing Lane, Robert Road, in an attempt to commit suicide.

### Husband Admits to Killing Adulterous Couple Without Remorse

Li Genyin (age 25), a native of Funing, has recently been working as a partner at the Youxin Shoe Store on Xinzha Road. His wife, Xu, became acquainted with Zhang Yongnian, also known as Yuntian, a fellow villager. Zhang is a translator for a Japanese store at 385 Wusong Road, Hongkou. On the 20th, at around 8 p.m., Xu and Zhang left the Haihualou Teahouse on the corner of Haining Road and North Zhejiang Road after having a meal, intending to take a yellow taxi to Hongkou. Li Genyin suddenly appeared from the side and blocked the vehicle.

He pulled out a sharp axe without asking any questions and wounded Zhang and his wife Xu in the arms and shoulders, attempting to flee. Hua, number 701, and a passerby, Xie Rongzhang, heard the alarm and arrived to arrest Li, taking him into custody at the Huike Police Station. The injured parties were taken to the hospital for treatment. These details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police transferred the suspect Li to the First Special District Court, prosecuting him for attempted murder under Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. They also stated that the defendant's wife, Xu, is currently in critical condition at Guangren Hospital, as her right arm bone has been severed, and her life may be in danger. The prosecution requested a postponement of the case. Xie Rongzhang, a native of Changzhou, testified that he witnessed the defendant violently attacking his wife and a man in a Western suit with an axe. Hua, number 701, arrived, drew his gun, and pointed it at Li, preventing him from moving. I grabbed him around the waist and apprehended him. The defendant confessed that his wife had recently been working as a servant in a Japanese household in Hongkou and had become involved with Zhang, a fellow villager. He stated that he had been waiting on North Sichuan Road and saw his wife and Zhang together, claiming they were returning from a certain hotel. He had already argued with his wife once, telling her to find another employer, but they still could not separate. Therefore, in a moment of anger, he obtained an axe from a stall and a triangular knife. He knew they were having dinner at Haihualou, so he waited at the intersection of Tiantong Road and North Zhejiang Road. After a while, they passed by, and he used the axe to strike down the adulterer Zhang first. Xu jumped out of the rickshaw, attempting to hold him back, so he also struck her with the axe. Judge Huang Risheng ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for further investigation.

### Finance　Economic Aid to China News Spreads, Cash Plunge Intensifies

Yesterday, the cash market appeared sluggish and lifeless, with a weak and listless momentum. The price even broke through the 2,120 yuan mark. It was suddenly reported that countries like the United States and the United Kingdom would actively provide economic aid to China. Furthermore, in contrast, the Japanese currency has continued to decline recently, strengthening the confidence of Chinese and foreign people in the legal tender, making its future even brighter. As a result, most speculators felt apprehensive and entrusted money exchange businesses to sell off their holdings. At the same time, silver shops and cash houses (acting as intermediaries) successively sold off their positions, and securities firms (representing northern speculators) also followed suit with aggressive selling. In addition, buyers took the opportunity to push down prices and absorb the supply, leading to a significantly weakened market. Ultimately, the price fell to the day's lowest price of 2,113 yuan at closing, resulting in a further drop of 11 yuan. Although a certain silver shop (representing Hong Kong interests) made purchases at one point, it had no significant impact. Transactions were mediocre, with only about 600 taels changing hands. Silver ornaments followed the decline by 1 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Steep Decline of 11 Yuan

From the morning, the initial asking price from sellers for each bar (ten taels) was 2,123 to 2,124 yuan, but there were no buyers, causing the price to gradually decrease. At 9:50 AM, the opening price was 2,124 yuan, with cash houses selling 50 taels to money exchange businesses at a price of 2,120 yuan. After the opening, news of active economic aid to China by the United States, the United Kingdom, and other democratic countries suddenly spread, intensifying the selling pressure and breaking through the 20 yuan mark. Cash houses sold 10 taels to silver shops at a price of 19 yuan. Securities firms also began aggressively selling, and buyers seized the opportunity to push down prices and absorb the supply, further weakening the market. Securities firms sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop at a price of 15 yuan. Subsequently, silver shops sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop at the same price. Later, a broker, acting on behalf of a wealthy client, also sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop, also at a price of 15 yuan. Afterwards, securities firms sold 50 taels each to a certain silver shop and a gold shop, both at a price of 14 yuan. After this, the selling pressure eased slightly, and the price rebounded slightly. Silver shops sold 50 taels to money exchange businesses at a price of 16 yuan. Gold shops traded 50 taels among themselves at a price of 15 yuan, and then again at 17 yuan, setting the closing price for the morning session. Transactions became scarcer in the afternoon, and the trend reverted to a downward trajectory. The opening price was immediately 4 yuan lower, with money exchange businesses selling 50 taels to gold shops at a price of 13 yuan. At one point, sellers were asking for 12 yuan, but a certain gold shop suddenly began buying, causing sellers to stop selling and observe, so no transaction occurred. Later, a certain gold shop revised its buying price to 14 yuan, but the willingness of sellers waned, making it difficult to complete transactions. Therefore, the closing price remained at 2,113 yuan, resulting in a net decline of 11 yuan compared to the closing price of last Saturday night. The price fluctuated by 7 yuan throughout the day. The listed selling price of cash houses was 2,120 yuan, and the buying price was 2,110 yuan. The current margin was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but there were no transactions.

Jewelry Gold Listed Down One Yuan

The exchange price for jewelry gold at silver shops initially remained unchanged, but at 10:10 AM, after the cash price broke through the 20 yuan mark, it was lowered by 1 yuan. Dahantong changed its listed price to 215 yuan, and Xinhantong to 213 yuan. Buying prices were all 207 to 208 yuan.

Sino-British Pure Gold Remained Unchanged

The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash remained at 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price for Customs gold remained the same, at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained fixed at 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao, due to the London cable on the 20th, which indicated that British pure gold remained at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce.

### Eager Selling of Foreign Exchange

Although foreign firms were buying spot in the foreign exchange market yesterday, local firms were selling, resulting in a stagnant situation without any changes. Initially, after rumors spread that the United States and the United Kingdom would actively provide economic aid to China, the futures market, coupled with the eager selling by Chinese firms such as Shanghai, and the lack of buyers except for speculators and yarn merchants, the situation became somewhat firm. However, it soon reverted. Trading was still active. As for Hong Kong exchange rates, the selling by foreign firms suddenly waned, and the situation became tight.

Early in the morning, London telegraphic transfers for both near and far terms decreased by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London gold also remained flat. The exchange rates for British, US, and French currencies against Shanghai remained unchanged. The exchange rates for US currency against British, Shanghai, and French currencies also remained unchanged. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. The opening selling prices for spot exchange at banks were 8 pence 25 for British currency and 16 yuan 0625 for US currency, both unchanged from the previous closing prices. After the opening, foreign firms first settled spot British currency at HSBC and Chartered Bank at 8 pence 25, and then settled spot US currency at American banks at 16 yuan 0625. Due to the balance between supply and demand, there were no changes. When HSBC announced that its listed rates would not change, and the silver equalization tax was announced at 2.5%, which is a slight 5.25%, Chinese merchants' speculators settled August British currency at China-Belgian Bank at 8 pence 125, followed by yarn merchants purchasing and settling July US currency at foreign firms at 15 yuan 9375 and buying August US currency at American banks at 15 yuan 875. The situation was still flat. Afterwards, news suddenly spread that the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries would actively provide economic aid to China, resulting in eager selling and a loosening of the futures market. Chinese firm Shanghai sold June US currency to foreign firms at 16 yuan. At the same time, it also sold June British currency to Chinese merchants' speculators at 8 pence 21875. Near noon, transactions in British and US currencies became less active, with only trading in Hong Kong currency. Eastern Bank eagerly bought spot currency at Huayi Bank at only 55 yuan 25. It became more difficult to buy after this, and the situation was quite weak. The banks' selling prices for spot currency at the noon closing were the same as the morning opening for British and US currencies, and only 55 yuan 125 for Hong Kong currency.

In the afternoon, foreign firms continued to buy spot British currency from China-Belgian Bank at 8 pence 25, and then settled spot US currency at American Bank at 16 yuan 0625, and the situation remained flat. Later, Chinese merchants' speculators settled August British currency at Dutch Bank at 8 pence 125, and then bought July British currency at American Bank at 8 pence 1875. At that time, the situation was still slightly loose. Afterwards, a certain bank sold July US currency to foreign firms at 15 yuan 9375, and Huayi Bank also sold August US currency to HSBC at 15 yuan 875. The situation reverted. The Hong Kong currency market was quite calm, and there were no reported transactions. The price was also stable. Until the evening closing, the banks' selling prices for spot currency were 8 pence 25 for British currency and 16 yuan 0625 for US currency. As a result, compared to last Saturday afternoon's closing, spot British and US currency remained unchanged, but near-term contracts loosened. The final selling price for spot Hong Kong currency was 55 yuan 125, a decline of .25.

### Discount Rate Enters 50 Yuan Range

Call Loan Rate Rises by One Point

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange dropped sharply again, with the discount rate per thousand yuan breaking into the 50 yuan range. Initially, the morning rate was flat, remaining at 50 yuan and 0.05 yuan. Then, supply surged and suddenly plummeted to 49 yuan and 0.5 yuan. At noon, it rebounded slightly to 49 yuan and 0.75 yuan. The afternoon trend was stagnant, remaining at 49 yuan and 0.75 yuan, a drop of 7.5 fen compared to the previous week. The call loan rate among money dealers rose by 1 fen, listed at 1 jiao and 1 fen.

### Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rate Drops Slightly by Half a Yuan

United Bank Notes Continue to Fall by Five Jiao

(Tianjin) 22nd telegram. Compared with the 20th (last Saturday), foreign exchange rates have not changed. The Shanghai exchange rate has dropped slightly by five jiao. The opening market prices for the morning are listed below: British currency 8 pence 109375, US currency 15 yuan 8125, Shanghai exchange rate 102 yuan (Shanghai exchange rate is the amount of Shanghai legal tender receivable in Tianjin for 100 yuan).

Another telegram: The gray market exchange rate for "United Bank Notes" compared to the morning opening on the 20th (Saturday) continued to decrease by five jiao. 100 yuan of legal tender can buy 122 yuan and 5 jiao of "United Bank Notes", which means that one yuan of "United Bank Notes" is only worth 0.816326531 of legal tender.

(Hong Kong) 22nd telegram. The exchange rates for British, American, and Shanghai currencies in Hong Kong were the same as the prices at 11:30 AM on the 20th (last Saturday). At 11:30 AM, the British currency decreased slightly by 0.03125, with a price of 1 shilling and 2 and 7/8 pence. The US currency also decreased by 0.0625, with a price of 29 yuan. The Shanghai currency decreased slightly by 2.5 jiao, with a price of 180 yuan and 2.5 jiao.

Japanese Currency Only Worth Nine Jiao

Last Saturday, British pure gold and British and American exchange rates did not change. Yesterday, foreign exchange in this port was actively settled by foreign firms, and the supply from banks was smooth, so the market price was stable without change. When the cash market opened, gold shops were active in selling, and the market situation was weak. Afterwards, wealthy individuals and silver shops sold even more eagerly, and the price became more and more weak. Fortunately, gold shops took the opportunity to absorb at low prices, and the downward trend gradually stopped. In the afternoon, money exchange businesses and wealthy individuals supplied more eagerly, and the market price declined. Foreign currency, British and American gold pounds, and wealthy individuals increased selling trends. Demand was scarce, and prices all declined. British gold notes and Hong Kong notes were in great demand and rose slightly. The supply of US gold notes was relatively smooth, and French franc notes were in demand, and prices all declined. Dutch notes and Annam notes were quite in demand and firm. Japanese gold notes were valued at nine jiao of legal tender, and Korean notes were valued at eight jiao of legal tender. The rapid and disastrous decline of Japanese currency has attracted a lot of attention. In fact, it is inevitable due to the fact that the deficit public debt has reached its peak and non-convertible paper money is being issued without limit, which is the principle of economics. Transactions in the Exchange were very sparse. Only Fuhexian came to Taizin Annam with 100 yuan. Yesterday's market price: British gold pounds fell one jiao, British gold notes rose two fen, American gold pounds fell one jiao and five fen, American gold notes fell five li, Hong Kong notes rose three li, French franc notes fell two hao and five fen, and Dutch and Annam notes each rose one fen. All other currencies remained unchanged.

### Currencies Linked to Japanese Yen Are Priced Well Below Legal Tender

Korean notes and "United Bank" notes, which are linked to the Japanese yen, share the same fate as the Japanese yen. In just the past ten days, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen against legal tender has gradually fallen, from 1.05 yuan (ie, the number of legal tender exchanged for one yuan of Japanese yen) to 9 jiao, a large decrease of 1 jiao and 5 li. Korean notes have also decreased from 8 jiao 7 fen 5 per yuan of legal tender to 8 jiao, a decrease of 7 fen 5 li. The "United Bank Notes" in North China are rebounding after a sharp decline, but the highest price is a discount of 83.3%, and recently it has returned to 81.6%. The "Huaxing" bank notes newly issued by the Japanese side are not in circulation on the market at all. It is rumored that on the first day of business, 600,000 yuan of legal tender was lost, probably due to stockpiled silver. There are some speculators in the gray market who accept these notes, at less than 60% of legal tender. Although the people in the occupied areas are forced to accept these notes, they are eager to get rid of them.

### Securities　Public Bonds are Rising, China Electric Shares Rise Again, Foreign Stock Market Sentiment is Good

The gray market for securities was stable yesterday. The shorts made some covering, and the rise was slow but firm. Rumors of a new loan from the United States and the United Kingdom made people more excited. Large bullish accounts took the opportunity to push up the price, but the increase was very small. Because the price has been high, the effort to push it up has waned. It is still questionable whether it can break through the 3 yuan mark. At the close, there was news that the Danzig issue was becoming tense again. Yesterday's progress: The morning opening saw Tongshun, Tongkang, and No. 4 buying, Qiafeng, Lianhe, and retail investors selling. Tiansheng was frequently trading in and out, and the market price was slightly higher by 1-2 jiao. In the afternoon, rumors of loans were circulating, with no confirmation. The market price was slightly up again by 1-2 jiao. Qiafeng, Lianhe continued to sell. Tongkang and No. 41 also sold off. There were many retail buyers. The result was slightly better by about 2-3 jiao. The total volume was more than 500,000 yuan. A simple table is below.

Gray market trading: It was initially discussed that the place on the seventh floor was too small, and it was changed to the fifth floor. Temporarily, some people disagreed, resulting in simultaneous trading on the fifth and seventh floors. It is said that a method of mediation is planned to be held on the sixth floor.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Nanshi China Commercial Electric shares were traded, priced at 5 yuan and 6.5 jiao, which is higher than before by several jiao.

Although trading in the public stock market of the public association was not active, the market sentiment was still good. Jardine shares, Kaiping shares and Hutchison Whampoa shares were stable. Ruirong shares rose again to a high price of 7 yuan and 8.5 jiao. It was difficult to see a new high buying price of 205 yuan for Gonghexin shares, and there were no sellers. Reclamation shares were priced at 8 yuan, and demand was very strong. Telephone shares reached a new high, with a buying price of 101 yuan. The market sentiment for corporate bonds continued to be good. 5.5% Power bonds were traded at 88 yuan and 2.5 jiao, and China Business Corporation's 8% bonds were priced at 57 yuan. The rubber stock market had a latent strong rise, but the turnover was limited.

### Yarn and Cotton　Hong Kong Merchants Resume Purchasing, Cotton Yarn Market Rises Again, Celestial Maiden and Double Horse Each Rise Seven or Eight Yuan

The yarn market has turned upward, and the rise continues to advance, because the environment has improved, and at the same time, the purchase of cotton from South China and Hong Kong has recovered, and the amount has slightly increased, and the mood on all sides is more determined. It is said that merchants from other places are also in a bullish position, so business is slightly better and the rise is stronger. Although the situation in Minhai is tense for the Shantou merchants, 20-count yarn is traded clearly, but 32-count single yarn is difficult to find, and it is said that most of it is transported to Hunan and Jiangxi for sale. Therefore, other merchants remain stagnant and as weak as usual. In the afternoon, it was heard that the actual need was not bad, and the mood was strong. The 20-count double horse foreign stack spot price reached 428 yuan and 0.5 yuan, but the price of the unpopular 20-count yarn was as dull as ever, and 20-count Five Sons opened at 390 yuan, but it was still not sold.

The situation of spot yarn: At the initial opening in the morning, the market situation was still peaceful. Due to reports of Japanese warships coming and going like shuttles in Minhai, people were exhausted, but Hong Kong merchants made some purchases, but most of them absorbed 32-count yarn, so the opening price of 20-count yarn was increased by 5 jiao, and the double horse spot price was 422 yuan. Hong Kong merchants entered 30 packages, and the stack price was increased by 2 yuan, to 417 yuan and 0.5 yuan. Halfway through, because the needs of Hong Kong and Shantou merchants were still not weak, the market rose again, but 20-count yarn was still flat, and the rise of 32-count single yarn was very strong. The closing price of the double horse stack was 417 yuan, and the foreign stack price was 424 yuan. In the afternoon, sales to customers were not bad, and the market price advanced slowly. The double horse stack was made to 421 yuan and 0.5 yuan, and the spot closing price was 428 yuan and 0.5 yuan. It is found that the statistics of the various merchants buying 2,100 packages throughout the day show that the price of double horse rose by 7 yuan, the price of Celestial Maiden rose by 8 yuan, the price of Double Earth rose by 2.5 yuan, and the price of 32-count single yarn rose by 3-4 yuan. The factory opened 30 packages of 32-count Flying Tiger from Anda Factory, priced at 530 yuan. Today, 75 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin. The amount of each merchant bought is listed as left,

Shantou 360, Peer 900

Mainland 105, Hong Kong 735

Statistics 2,100

The Japanese yarn market has fallen for many days in a row. Yesterday, the reaction suddenly rose sharply. At the same time, there were many rumors that the Qingdao Exchange had a strong upward trend. Therefore, Shanghai was affected, but the actual business was still mediocre and weak. The monthly price of 20-count Yueqin brand wooden yarn was 355 yuan, which was an increase of 6-7 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Limited Production, Brazilian Cotton Telegram Increases Price, Approximately 1 Yuan Increase per Load

Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was quite stagnant and small, and trading was also very quiet. There was only a small amount of short covering. Later, due to good news from Liverpool, the closing price rebounded by 1-2 pounds. However, recent and spot prices fell by 2-3 pounds. In Washington, there is no appropriate solution for the disposal of loan cotton. According to various reports, it is difficult to release the loan cotton in the past few weeks, so the price of July and spot prices may continue to rise. India, including the forecast, fell by 3 rupees, Egypt closed its market, converted to legal tender, the price of US cotton fell by 0.3 yuan per load, the price of Indian cotton fell by 1.25 yuan, and the Egyptian market remained unchanged.

In the Shanghai port foreign cotton market, because the goods arriving in various places in recent days have been very crowded, and the Indian cotton ordered by the industry has also poured in, they have been vigorously promoting it in the market for days. The overseas cotton market has risen sharply every day, and the price of the order is cheaper than the spot price. Each factory has very few spot transactions, and the factories are waiting quietly for the cotton price to fall before talking about transactions. Therefore, the cotton market has been quiet for more than a week, and it is feared that there will be no large-scale transactions this week. Yesterday, Brazil sent a telegram that because the production in that place is limited, the number of previous orders is huge, and it is feared that it will be difficult to purchase locally, so another telegram was sent to increase the price, and each piece was increased by more than one yuan. The conversion of yesterday's cotton market to delivery to the factory is as follows,

The business of local cotton has disappeared again, and not a single bag has been sold. However, the foreign cotton industry still has the appetite, and the factories have a slight need. As for the source of northern Jiangsu, it is still quiet. It is found that the total number of goods arriving in the past two days is 375 packages of Tongzhou Xiansha, and 112 packages of cotton from Beisha. The situation of the current cotton is recorded as left,

### Piece Goods　After Ningbo Resumes Sailing, Inquiries About Cloth Prices Have Risen, Postal Packages to Sichuan and Yunnan Are Still Not Accepted, and Southwest Trade Has Stalled

Domestic Cloth

Recently, the emergency preparedness in the concession has been lifted, people's hearts have stabilized, and domestic and foreign yarns and cotton have rebounded. Cloth has been in a tired state for a long time. Now that the environment has improved, Guangdong and Zhejiang merchants' current sales have been linked, and the market has gradually stabilized after the fall. Yesterday, coarse cloth and manual goods continued to fall by 5 fen per piece, and the price of bleached and dyed cloth and fine cloth twill were stable. Zhejiang merchants in Wenzhou, Jinhua and other ports bought coarse Jardine cloths, fine Shenxin Yong'an Dawei and other factory cloths, and a total of 200 pieces of each factory's colored twill and colored cloth. Since the resumption of navigation to Ningbo, letters have inquired about cloth prices, and there is an intention to handle it. Guangdong merchants have resumed handling about 200 pieces of white goods, fine cloth, and bleached and dyed fine cloth twill poplin printed goods. Large postal packages to Sichuan and Yunnan are still not allowed to be received by the post office, and it is difficult for coastal ships to accommodate them, so customers must postpone delivery. There is no intention to purchase new goods, so transactions are still stalled. The wholesale business of shops and mainland merchants in this street can still be maintained. Today, there are 55 pieces of cloth transported to Tianjin.

East Cloth

The market sentiment for white goods has turned firm, and fine cloth and fine twill are selling well due to active actual sales. The opening price of Abe City Foreign Company of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth in the morning market was 200 packages, which gradually increased from 13 yuan and 5 jiao to 6 jiao. The futures of the Lower Month for Treasure fine twill requires 12 yuan and 1 jiao, which has risen by 1 jiao and 5 fen compared to last week. The recovery of Four Gentlemen's serge in colored goods is also rapid. Yesterday, the price was called 4 jiao and 2.5 fen per yard. Tianjin merchants handled 400 pieces of white goods. The current and futures transactions in this street totaled 1,500 pieces. The market situation is quite stable.

### Many Woolen Fabrics Are Placed

Yesterday's woolen fabric transactions were quite prosperous. The weather is hot, and the business of the shop and the Western clothing industry has improved, which has led to the continued rise in various summer wool, cotton, and linen fabrics that are needed for the season. Therefore, the idea of placing orders is stronger than before. The machine customers of countries such as Britain and Italy have accepted many special orders, most of which are spring goods to be shipped in December and January. 12,000 pieces of 3 shillings and 11.5 pence, 7,000 pieces of 5 shillings and 4 pence, and printed woolen fabrics with Western characters on the sides are placed in large numbers. And in view of the prevalence of vegetable green, there is a considerable amount of fixed agreements.

### Silk and Tea　Factory Jing Rises 20 Yuan

Foreign silk market: Yokohama's near and distant futures reports show a slight increase. The spot price of 1,288 yuan rose by 8 yuan, the near-term price of 1,285 yuan rose by 10 yuan, and the distant-term price of 1,202 yuan rose by 11 yuan. New York and Lyon closed yesterday. This port's silk transactions were still more active in the French market. The white factory XB 20-22 pattern was sold at 1800-1810 yuan, which has risen by 10 yuan compared to last weekend. Yesterday, Kailixin, Furenchang jointly entered 150 loads. In addition, gray Jing Shuang Palace, which has not been sold for a long time, also had the same transaction. The silk price rose by 20 yuan compared to the previous transaction. Yinzhuang Muzhen silk, Samsung Meida and other companies entered 30 loads. Only the white factory 7-8 points are sold to the United States. It has been stopped for a long time. Yesterday, an electricity price of 1850 yuan was issued, but we still need to look at the New York incoming account.

Yesterday, 780 pieces of tea came from Hong Kong, and 1,569 pieces came from Wenzhou.

### Food　Flour Factory Attention　North China Market　After Depreciation, Tianjin Sales Gradually Activate　Wholesale Prices in This Street Fall Together

Yesterday, Ben Flour Factory's market publicly depreciated the No. 2 flour customer's market. After the depreciation last weekend, this street also asked for a reduction, so since yesterday, the wholesale price in this street has also been reduced to 4 yuan and 4 jiao in cash. The selling price of Nanyang merchants is still 4 yuan and 4.5 jiao. Because the Nanyang merchants need retail, the factory does not care about it. What they pay attention to is the North China market. It was heard yesterday that the disposal in Tianjin has gradually become active, and approximately 30,000 packages of continued Kai soldiers' ships and gun carriages have been continued. The number of domestic and Nanyang merchants in this street is approximately 20,000 packages. However, at present, customer sales are still on a trial basis, so the market is slightly uneven. It is said that 10,000 packages of flour will be transported to Tianjin on the 23rd.

The market situation for foreign flour is also depressed. It is found that foreign orders are still not planned, futures have been lacking in transactions for a long time, and the current flour that has arrived in the market, except for most of it being directly distributed to customers, the remaining goods have been stranded in the Northern Ocean for a long time. There is also little care in the mainland of this street, and the factory flour has also fallen sharply. The market has fallen. It is said that it is not easy to sell it at a low price. As a result, 30,000 packages of transactions such as bats, ships, and gun emplacements were made, all of which were handled by Tianjin merchants at a price of 4 yuan and 5 jiao. It is heard that nearly 10,000 packages of retail transactions in this street were also made.

### New Wheat Harvest Is Promising, Old Wheat Continues to Arrive

Yesterday's wheat market transactions were still not progressing. Recently, the supply from the mainland has been constant, because the old wheat is gradually falling due to the order, the market price in the producing area is frequently loose, and this year's new wheat harvest looks good, and the morale of the people is weak. Each flour factory has long been disappointed in its appetite, and only relying on the Japanese merchants has made the market boring. It was heard yesterday that Japanese merchants added 3-400 bags each of Nanjing and Chuzhou wheat at a price of 6 yuan and 3 jiao. Among the goods delivered to the factory, Jue wheat was sold for only 6 yuan.

### Saigon Rice　2,000 Tons Officially Traded

There has been talk on the market for some time about tacit agreements on foreign rice orders, but formal transactions did not take place until yesterday when 2,000 tons of Saigon were traded. The original package of 100 kilograms was priced at 19 yuan and 4 jiao, and was sold by Dafu Foreign Company, and it was handled by the four firms Shuntai, Shunfeng, Zhengda and Houde. As for the next batch of transactions, they are still being discussed by telegram. If we can continue to reach an agreement, it can be confirmed this week.

### Customer Hoarding Sells Out, Gengxian Prices Rebound Slightly

Du Geng Yesterday, customers from other regions came to He Xia, Songjiang and Nangang near No. 10, with more than 4,000 packages of Wheelbarrow Dumpling Su Tong Kunshan. The overall situation seems to be hovering. Because the price limit for each type of goods has been eliminated in an invisible way, according to the current behavior, it seems that it has reached the top, and because the source has gradually become clear, the morale of the people is inevitably turning flat, so the sales market in this street turned lazy again yesterday, and the hoarders mostly sold out, making it difficult for the market to stand. As a result, the price of thick and thin geng fell by 1.5 to 2 jiao, and Changbai geng only opened 17 yuan and 6 jiao. However, the trend in the late market was more active. Du Yang Jian Bujian followed the Geng market by a small jiao. The destination for Ke Jian was more stagnant, and the middle section was reduced by 2-3 jiao. Bian Yuan Yuan fell by 2 jiao at the same time. There were few inquiries about foreign glutinous rice, and the market continued to be tired.

Ke Xian Yesterday, the week's trading started with Ke Tuan coming to Liangchong to offer samples for sale. It happened that there was news that a new agreement had been reached on foreign rice, and Geng Jian also fell. The market followed the mood and went down, and more customers were watching. Xin Tuan was willing to be lazy, and the total number of transactions in the market was less than 4,000 packages, most of which were handled by retail households in this street. The price was less than 2-3 jiao from the previous market. The high-end Bing was guarded and not opened, and Zhongjue was soft. The price of Juqi Juqi reached as low as 13 yuan, and the price of Ke Yuan foreign glutinous rice also fell by 2-3 jiao because of the excessive number of small sales.

Also reported yesterday (22nd), 3,470 packages of rice came to Shanghai from Hong Kong.

### Miscellaneous Grains　Soybeans Actual Sales Are Not Prosperous　Zha Beans Transactions Are Also Scarce

Although the stock of soybeans is not too thick, the source is still uninterrupted, and the actual sales are not rising, so it is difficult to rise, and the market is frequently falling. At the moment, the Xi Chang gang is affected by the direct impact of Lian Dou. The market price in that port is still lower than the Shanghai market, so the destination in this port has not improved. However, if the market in this city can be further reduced, the destination in that gang may have approaching hope. Yesterday's market Dalian Dou, the price was still opened at 8 yuan and 7 jiao, with 200 packages traded. Duzhi Sha Huang fell by 3-4 fen, opened 60 packages of Zhang Yan Du Dou, priced at 10 yuan, and 50 packages of Chongming Sha Huang at 8 yuan and 9 jiao. Only the Han Kou Zha Dou fell by 2 jiao and 5 fen compared to last Thursday, with more than 600 packages traded, priced at 8 yuan and 5 fen, which is nothing more than the reason why the goods are abundant and the sales are sluggish.

1,300 packages of beans came from Tianjin on the 22nd.

### Sugar Market: Slightly Increased Transactions of Chaozhou Sugar

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was firm and stable. The guild set the price for the best quality coarse white sugar at 27.5 yuan at this shop, and 27.4 yuan at other shops, an increase of two jiao. Transshipment goods rose to 19.3 yuan, with 1,200 bags transacted. Goods arriving by ship on June 3rd rose by five fen to 19.4 yuan, with 300 bags transacted. The current price for "Big Golden Coin" brand was 27.7 yuan. Taikoo "Car White" brand rose five fen to [illegible] jiao, with "B" brand selling for 27.05 to 27 yuan, totaling 500 bags. "CW" brand was priced at 26.8 yuan, and "CX" brand at 26.6 yuan, with no changes. Current price for Dutch brown sugar was 18.7 yuan, and transshipment goods were 13 yuan. There was a larger offering of Chaozhou sugar from domestic sugar factories, with 300 bags of Shantou refined white sugar offered at 25.1 yuan, finalized at 24.67 yuan. Over 300 bags of Zhuang red sugar were offered at 15.9 yuan, finalized at 15.85 to 15.8 yuan. Hundreds of bags of "Ti Qing" sugar were offered at 15.55 yuan. Several thousand bags of ordinary "Zhi Yang" sugar were offered at 17.5 yuan. The Jian sugar factory offered over a hundred bags of "Diao Qing" sugar at 14 yuan.

On the 22nd, sugar imports included 5,550 bags from Hong Kong, 1,770 bags from Shantou, and 600 bags from Xiamen.

### Northwest Goods: Hunan Lotus Seeds Plunge by a Significant Ten Yuan

Due to seasonal factors, Hunan lotus seeds, if not stored in refrigerated warehouses, are prone to softening and spoilage. Coupled with sluggish sales, they are susceptible to price drops. It is reported that the private market price for this year's Hunan lotus seeds has fallen to 80 yuan, a sharp drop of more than ten yuan compared to before. Retailers are firmly asking for 80 yuan, but finalized prices are only around 50 yuan. Compared to the highest price, the difference is said to be thirty to forty yuan.

### Oil Cakes: Rising Prices of Raw Peanut Oil Surpass Soybean Oil

Yesterday, the price surge in peanut oil was stronger than that of soybean oil. Soybean oil relied mainly on support from bullish companies, resulting in a tight exterior but loose interior. Peanut oil prices rose rapidly due to high costs and domestic transportation. Yesterday, it was estimated that 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw peanut oil were transacted at prices ranging from 42 to 43 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan compared to last week. Eighty barrels of Dalian barrelled raw peanut oil were transacted at 42.5 to 43 yuan, also up one yuan. The stockpiling and sales of Dalian soybean oil totaled over 1,200 barrels, with current prices at 40 yuan for spot goods and 39.8 yuan for goods en route. Additionally, twenty barrels of bleached oil were sold at 41 yuan, and fifty barrels of "Harvest Year" oil were sold at 39.4 to 39.6 yuan. Other Yantai oil transactions included 120 pieces at 30.05 yuan, Qingdao oil at 100 pieces at 30.01 yuan, and Jiaozhou oil at 100 pieces at 29.8 yuan.

On the 22nd, 9,000 pieces of soybean cake and 970 pieces of soybean oil were shipped from Yantai. 2,140 cans of tea oil and 3,038 pieces of hide oil were shipped from Wenzhou. 220 pieces of cottonseed oil were shipped from Tianjin.

### Hardware: Yellow Steel Wire: Active Trading in This Street

The long-dormant yellow steel wire has recently seen a surge in demand because spring factories, thermos factories, and iron bed factories in this street are all opening or expanding, leading to concerns that popular varieties will be completely sold out. However, merchants from other locations don't have much of a need for it. It's estimated that over 500 dan were offered yesterday, resulting in a shortage of circulating goods on the market and a rise in prices. Currently, coarse varieties are priced at 18 yuan per dan, medium varieties at 19 yuan per dan, and fine varieties at 20 yuan per dan. As for mixed varieties, they are priced at around 16 yuan per dan.

### Medicinal Materials: Increased Arrival of Bitter Almonds Leads to Continued Price Drop

The highest price for bitter almonds once reached 71 or 72 yuan, prompting merchants to continuously ship goods to Shanghai. It has been found that previously, those without permits were already selling at 52 yuan. Yesterday, a certain store received over thirty bags, opening them at 47 yuan. However, the store still has 300 bags in stock, and due to cost considerations, they are only willing to sell them at 50 yuan. Furthermore, production prices are unlikely to loosen, so the overall trend is expected to stabilize.

### My Life as a Doctor (Part 1)

— Fan Shouyuan

Looking back, it has been a full ten years since I left medical school, entered society, and took on the role of a doctor. In these ten years, which are neither too long nor too short, there are indeed many things that can be written about. Now, I want to write about some of the characteristics of a doctor's life that I have felt over the years, as well as some miscellaneous thoughts, as a souvenir of my ten years as a doctor.

The profession of a doctor is classified by people in society as a liberal profession. I am not sure of the exact meaning of the term "liberal profession." I don't know if it is because this profession is considered to be more free and comfortable compared to other professions? However, there are indeed many people in society who secretly admire the profession of a doctor, regarding our lives as doctors as very leisurely and fulfilling. Often, when friends gather and chat over tea and cigarettes, when discussing career lives, they express their admiration and praise for the life of a doctor: "Being a doctor is the best, you are the one being sought after, not the one seeking," "A doctor's life is so free and comfortable!" "The profession of a doctor is so meaningful!"... In the beginning, even when I myself had not yet become a doctor and had not tasted the life of a doctor, I somewhat held this kind of mentality and had this kind of thought. However, after I joined the ranks of the medical profession and tasted the life of a doctor, I realized that my previous ideal of a doctor's life was inaccurate: in fact, the taste of a doctor's life is not as free and comfortable, as fulfilling as imagined.

Just taking the word "free" as an example, most professions have plenty of free time outside of work events: A doctor's life—at least for a large part of doctors—is different: in addition to engaging in diagnosis and treatment during consultation hours, in the event of special emergencies outside of consultation hours, they must also come to diagnose and treat. In the middle of the night, when people in various professions are having sweet dreams, a doctor is often unexpectedly visited by a patient with an emergency, and must wake up from a sweet dream to perform treatment. In the hot summer, many people in professional jobs can stop working and take a summer break, but for doctors, due to the increase in heat-related illnesses, their work becomes even busier. In the hot summer months, very few doctors stop seeing patients to take a summer break. This is in terms of tangible work; a doctor's life is not as leisurely and free as most people imagine. As for responsibility, because the object of a doctor's work is the patient, that is, bearing the heavy responsibility for the life and death of the patient, its importance is evident. If the treatment is successful, that is the doctor's duty; if the treatment is unsuccessful, although it is due to the incurable nature of the disease, not due to the doctor's lack of effort or improper treatment, sometimes the doctor will still be blamed by the patient's family. Especially given the current situation in China, due to the majority of patients' lack of understanding of modern medicine, incidents of lawsuits against doctors are more likely to occur. Therefore, speaking of the doctor's life itself, I can use the four words "busy and responsible" to describe it.

A doctor's "busy and responsible" life is indeed a fact, but is the remuneration that doctors receive in society more abundant than that of people in other industries? Indeed, many people in society must regard the profession of a doctor as an easy way to get rich and make a fortune. I don't think that's quite right. Apart from the relatively affluent income of a few upper-class doctors, most doctors, especially lower-class doctors who are loyal to their duties and without the character of a charlatan, are no better off than people in other professions. Generally speaking, the income of an average middle-class doctor may be slightly more than that of an average middle-class professional, but a doctor's essential expenses are also relatively large. For example, if an average middle-class doctor has a monthly income of 300 yuan, but the essential expenses of the clinic at home, etc., require 350 yuan, they will feel the danger of not being able to make ends meet; this is not as good as an average professional who earns 200 yuan a month and only needs 150 or 160 yuan for family expenses.

Does this mean that a doctor's life has become a very uninteresting and meaningless profession? That's not the case either. Apart from a portion of people who are burdened by life and do not understand the true meaning of a doctor's life, there are also many who have a strong sense of meaning and supreme interest in a doctor's life. As for myself, I can say that I have a strong interest in a doctor's life. This interest and meaning are definitely not in the material rewards, or in how free or leisurely a doctor's life is. Where is my life's interest? First, it lies in the significance of medical work itself; when I see a patient, make an accurate diagnosis, and provide correct treatment, and the patient is cured as a result, my spirit gains supreme comfort and victory. This kind of spiritual comfort and victory cannot be compared to material rewards. When I see a patient who has not yet been diagnosed, or when the diagnosis cannot be determined, I have no choice but to further explore and investigate. In the process of thinking about and exploring the cause and symptoms of the disease, interest will arise spontaneously. If, after deep thinking and research, the cause of the disease is finally found, then regardless of the difficulty of treating the disease, there will always be a correct direction for treatment. At this time, my spirit also feels unspeakable joy. Down the line, if the treatment results are good and the disease is cured, it is truly better than winning a charitable lottery; even if the treatment is not good and the patient ultimately cannot be saved, I have lived up to the patient in terms of responsibility, and I have lived up to myself in terms of conscience and duty. This kind of spiritual victory and peace of mind are the most valuable gains for those who live the life of a doctor: anyone who has a deep understanding of the significance of the doctor's work can feel it.

### A Brief Discussion of Measles

— Cheng Hanzhang

(Measles is also known as Shazi or Yizi)

How is measles transmitted?

The pathogen of measles exists in the secretions and blood of the nasal and oral mucosa of sick children. The route of transmission is direct spread of the secretions from the mouth and nose of a sick child to the body of another healthy child, and indirect spread from the media of healthy people or the clothes, bedding, utensils, and other items used by sick children. The ability to infect is very strong, especially during the rash period. It's a little worse later.

The period when children are most susceptible to measles

Generally, children under one month of age are less likely to contract measles. The period from one to five years of age is the most susceptible to infection. Especially children from one to two years old. After the age of fifteen, it is rare. Once you have had measles, you can be immune for life. No longer contagious.

Within a year, the spring and autumn seasons are the most prevalent.

Symptoms of measles

After contracting measles, it takes about ten days to develop a fever, and the rash appears three days after the fever. The fever subsides four or five days after the rash appears. Therefore, the entire course of measles can be divided into four stages.

(1) Incubation period: 10 to 11 days: Healthy children have no abnormalities during this period.

(2) Prodromal period: Also known as the mucosal inflammation period, lasting three to four days. During this period, the whole body develops a fever, and symptoms such as conjunctivitis, pharyngeal mucosal inflammation, and nasal mucosal inflammation appear. This results in sneezing, coughing, and photophobia. Although the rash has not yet appeared during this period, mucosal rashes can be seen in the oral mucosa. The most important diagnostic target is a rash called "Koplik's spots." This is a small white spot that appears on the buccal mucosa opposite the molars within one or two days after the fever, slightly raised and surrounded by a red halo.

Appearing simultaneously or slightly later than Koplik's spots is the soft palate mucosa, especially the mucosa near the uvula, which develops pinhead-sized, irregular, dark red mucosal rashes. These mucosal rashes are very short-lived and soon disappear. And they are often lacking and invisible.

(3) Eruptive period: By the fourteenth day after infection, the initial rash appears behind the ears and on the face, starting small and gradually becoming larger. The largest rash is the size of a pea. This rash gradually spreads to the head, torso, and limbs. The rash covers the entire body one and a half to two days after it appears.

Many people have a fever of 40 degrees Celsius. Consciousness is impaired, and infants may have convulsions. If the mucosal inflammation worsens, bronchitis often occurs. In addition, there may be diarrhea and lymph node swelling.

(4) Recovery period is the desquamation period. At the end of the rash period, the body temperature drops within one or two days. Systemic symptoms also improve.

The fading of the rash is in the same order as the appearance of the rash. Then the skin flakes off. (commonly known as peeling) The very small flakes finish falling off in three to seven days.

During measles, the mucous membranes of almost all organs in the body are affected. Therefore, various symptoms appear; the general situation is as follows: (To be continued)

### The Various Types of Vitamin Deficiency Diseases

— Hou Guangdi

Someone asked why everyone eats white rice, but not everyone develops beriberi. The answer is that our food is very complex. In addition to rice, there are also supplements of vegetables, fish, and meat. But what supplements are there besides rice for refugees and prisoners? Therefore, eating white rice leads to illness. So what can be done to remedy this? The answer is to change to eating brown rice, supplemented with bran powder, wheat bran, adzuki beans, mung beans, peanuts, etc.

(1) Vitamin C deficiency: also known as scurvy. It is caused by a lack of fresh vegetables, meat, and fruit. It causes swelling and decay of the gums, ulceration of the oral cavity, and easy bleeding of internal and external membranes, resulting in subcutaneous bleeding spots, purpura, lumps, and systemic weakness, anemia, and mental dullness. This is called scurvy. Infants who are only fed canned milk powder will also develop the same disease. In addition, all febrile infectious diseases, especially pneumonia and tuberculosis, greatly increase the body's need for this element. Therefore, it is also necessary in treatment.

(2) Vitamin A deficiency: Various animal fats contain the most of this. Fish liver oil is one of them. Others include milk, egg yolk, and the green parts of vegetables. But vegetable oil does not contain it. When the human body is undernourished and lacks this element, it can cause hair loss, rough skin, bad nails, inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva, and inflammation and swelling of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, digestive tract, and reproductive organs. The most obvious is night blindness. Tuberculosis patients often take this element because they lose weight rapidly and consume too much, in order to increase resistance.

(3) Vitamin D deficiency: This element is essential for metabolism in the human body. It is needed by both the old and the young. It is indispensable during the development period and during pregnancy and lactation. Since nursing mothers, pregnant women, and infants have universally adopted this element, rickets and osteomalacia in children have been reduced by 90%. But most people often lack this element due to malnutrition, and still need a large amount of supplementation.

The above four vitamins are the main components of nutrition. Other vitamins have recently been discovered.

Vitamin E is oil-soluble and is extracted from malt powder. It is an essential element for conception in mice, and in humans, it has the effect of preventing miscarriage.

Vitamin F is acidic linoleic acid. It is an essential element for the development and reproduction of mice.

Vitamin G is extracted from Vitamin B. Its symbol is B2. In the past, clinicians referred to it as being able to treat pellagra. But it has now been proven that this disease is caused by a lack of nicotinic acid. Black tongue in dogs and pellagra in humans can be cured with nicotinic acid.

Vitamin H is a derivative of amino acids. If mice lack this element, they will develop seborrheic dermatitis. It has a similar relationship to eczema and similar skin inflammations in humans.

Vitamin K is a clotting factor that resists bleeding. It is a normal chicken blood coagulant. It is heat-resistant and oil-soluble, so it is different from Vitamins A, D, and E. This element is contained in green vegetables, pig liver oil, hemp seeds, spinach, alfalfa, fish, and meat. According to recent reports, giving bile and alfalfa to patients with bleeding can greatly increase their blood clotting ability. Someone used it to treat hemorrhagic jaundice and achieved remarkable results. (End)

### Medical Insights

— Sizhai

Caput Medusae

In liver cirrhosis, there is collateral circulation. At this time, the umbilical vein left over from fetal life conducts blood from the portal vein trunk to the navel. One side flows through the superior epigastric vein and internal mammary vein back to the superior vena cava, and the other side flows through the inferior epigastric vein, saphenous vein, and femoral vein into the inferior vena cava. Therefore, a special morphology occurs; its shape is similar to the head of the goddess in Greek mythology, and it is called caput medusae.

Familial Appendicitis

In the same family, there are often many people suffering from appendicitis. This is called familial appendicitis, because appendicitis is related to lifestyle.

Carcinomatous Peritonitis

If the intestine has cancer, when it presses or pulls adjacent organs, it induces pain and blood circulation disorders in the compressed organ, or secondarily develops peritoneal cancer and causes localized or generalized peritonitis. This is the so-called carcinomatous peritonitis.

### The "New" of "New Poetry"

— Yanqi

The so-called "new poetry," from a certain point of view, does have "new" forms, "new" styles, "new" emotions, and "new" meanings; but what remains in the minds of ordinary people as "new poetry" is just "vernacular written in lines." In fact, the "new" of "new poetry" is by no means just writing in lines, or using vernacular sentences; because "new poetry" is not only "new," but also "poetry."

I remember that Mr. Ke wrote an article on poetry, in which there was a famous saying that is still worth mentioning as a new saying.

He said: "Anything that involves seeing scenery, generating emotions, sensing time, lamenting events, singing about objects, conveying metaphors, chanting in response, or giving gifts cannot be considered new poetry."

His meaning is: you can't find anything "new" by circling in the old circle, and "new" things will never hide in the old circle. "New poetry" jumped out of the old circle of "old poetry"; having jumped out, of course, there is no need to turn back and stick a foot back in, so that there is only a new format, but no new nature. For example, ancient people loved to write poems recording the life of secluded mountain forests, all because their lives could have the life of secluded mountain forests. They sat by springs in pavilions, dipped their brushes in ink, and naturally wrote about such secluded things. If this thing is put in an old frame, it is naturally "old poetry." But if today's poets also write poems about secluded hermitages, it is immediately obvious that they have been fooled by the ancients and have fallen into the old clichés of the ancients. Where can we now find secluded mountain forests to retire to? Even if we find them, can we live in seclusion peacefully? And can we write poetry leisurely? Unfortunately, today's world does not allow such things.

However, too realistic goods are all vulgar objects in the eyes of poets. Western-style houses, cars, and airplanes are all considered "scientific" and unworthy of being put into poetry! So, the "new" poets began to wander, learning from the ancients was not suitable, and taking out their own things was too vulgar, so they had to turn around and around on women's mouths. And what about the so-called "new poetry"? The format is "new," the subject matter is "new," but after being "new," it falls into another "old" situation.

"New" becomes "old" is a representative of "before" and "after." When I see the line written in lines, "Alas! My hometown!", I only see a piece of "old" and a pile of "backwardness." If this is also considered "new poetry," then I really have to start doubting it.

Conversely, if you write a marching song, even if the "poetic" meaning is less, the "new" flavor may be able to stay a little more; then at least it can give me a little "new" feeling.

It seems that some people think that if a poem is written in a foreign format, it is new even if it is not new. This really makes me cringe! "New poetry" has finally jumped out of the shackles of the "old poetry" style. If it drills into a foreign cage again, it is inevitable that it cannot completely become "new." I personally feel that if "new poetry" wants to put on foreign shackles, it is actually better to use the style of ci. Because since you are afraid that there will be problems without shackles, then why not be content and not jump out of the inherent form, as long as you find "new" in nature and soul. And at this time, on the old form and old style, not only do you not have to ignore them, but you should even pay more attention to them. You must be able to find "old" in the "old" before you can create a new soul. And blindly seeing scenery, generating emotions, sensing time, lamenting events, singing about objects, conveying metaphors, and chanting in response, always playing and playing this set, even if the person is a "new" person, the poem is still an "old poem."

Now, let me quote a few sentences from Eliot's "Tradition and the Individual Talent" to make it clear: "No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead. I mean this as a principle of æsthetic, not merely historical, criticism. The necessity that he shall conform, that he shall cohere, is not onesided; the more truly new work of art is a creation, the more completely is it formed and the more complete the transformation of the existing order. The existing order is complete before the new work arrives; for order to persist after the supervention of novelty, the whole existing order must be, if ever so slightly, altered; and so the relations, proportions, values of each work of art toward the whole are readjusted; and that is what happens when a new work of art is created and when new and old adapt each other."

### The Eve of the Retreat from Nanjing

— Le Huan

"You have a new mission. You must cross the river today. There is a boat docked at Shangxinhe. Go find the General Logistics Department." The department director said calmly and seriously. It was difficult to gauge the fate of the front line from his expressionless face.

"Then let's go!" I took from the director's banana-like palm enough living expenses to sustain our group for half a year.

Blankets, food bags, thermos bottles, fully armed, like a camel on an expedition. There was no joy or sorrow on the faces of the comrades, their expressions were still so calm. Saying goodbye to the director and the staff of another department, we were spat out from the mouth of this large monster. The weak sun was hanging overhead, it was noon, but we hadn't even thought about getting a few sweets. We exited Yijiang Gate and stepped onto the pond embankment full of reeds; every five or six steps there was a deep pit. We saw eagle claws above, but we didn't avoid them.

It was already evening when we arrived at Shangxinhe. It was a small town by the river, where we could no longer see any shops with open doors, but the common people were still sparsely found on the streets.

"Who knows when we'll be back here after leaving today?" Across from where we stood, an old woman in a tofu shop was laboriously moving a large vat; but there was no sorrow on her face.

"One day this place will still be ours. Just wait!" A young man, probably her son, was actively helping to move things, his spirits were extremely high.

They looked at us, with honest and simple smiles, but there was no conversation. They were too busy.

After two hours of searching all the nearby small harbors, we didn't find a trace of our boat. The sun had been completely swallowed by the earth, and the surroundings were eerily quiet; punctuated only by the approaching, dense machine-gun fire, and intermittent small cannon fire.

"Report, officer!" A brother covered in mud and ash suddenly ran up, the sweat on his forehead dripping down, his chest a large wet patch, carrying a gun, still panting.

"What's the matter?"

"May I ask where our machine gun company is? The battalion commander ordered me to notify them to prepare for battle. The enemy is only two li away from here..." he said quickly.

"We don't know that. We are from the ___ department; please ask at the front of the mountain," we expressed our sincere apologies for not being able to give him an answer.

However, this sudden news was so stimulating. Should we wait? Or return to the city? Two questions swirled in the minds of each comrade. Finally, we decided: if we encountered them along the way, we would actively exert our power.

Suddenly, an officer in a black military uniform ran up from afar:

"Are you ___ commander? Is the division commander ___?" He looked at our unit number and said. He was quite young, the local police chief; due to his duties, he was still searching and patrolling in the darkness.

"Yes!" we replied in unison. Although the words were so simple, everyone was filled with enthusiasm, and everyone had this common thought in their hearts:

"If we encounter them, then we will have this officer with rich military knowledge to contact each other."

We gathered around him and chatted randomly, he was very familiar with the situation of our division.

"—You'd better go back to the city." He spoke very slowly. Perhaps he was afraid that we didn't know the situation here yet.

"I'm afraid we can't go back to the city either!" We called the discerning comrade Xiao Kai.

"That's not necessarily true, there is a shortcut from here to Shuixi Gate, it only takes six or seven li to reach. He looked at his watch, "Oh—7:30. Judging from the time, the city bridge may not have been blown up before you reach the city gate."

He carefully told us the ordinary and special passwords; and drew a clear map.

For the sake of our mission, we left him.

On the broken and uneven brick road flowed crowds of refugees and armed comrades.

Dense machine gun fire, mixed with small cannons; children's cries, accompanied by dog barks; the hissing of bullets and the sound of whistles playing in unison, the sky was even darker. But the area around the city was ablaze with a prairie fire, the red light illuminating the sky.

We passed through with hurried breaths and quickened steps.

The outline of the city bridge could still be distinguished in the fiery light, and we breathed a sigh of relief.

The city bridge was covered with explosives and wires: it would complete its mission in a very short time and destroy itself.

Led by an officer from friendly forces, we crossed the fully armed city bridge.

We were thrown back into the embrace of the ancient city, and our pace slowed down a lot. (Proceeds from Charity Sale)

### Random Thoughts

— Editor

Mr. Yan Qi's "New Poetry"'s "newness" arriving before Mr. Xing Guangzu's "Defense of New Poetry" is purely coincidental that everyone is discussing new poetry at the same time, and is not aimed at "Defense of New Poetry". I should declare this here.

### Unreasonable

— Hua Fu

Although humans are the "spirit of all things" and surpass all things in every way, it is a pity that they have not completely escaped the scope of "all things", and still retain some "thing" nature, being unreasonable.

It would be fine if unreasonableness came from illiterate people, commoners, or barbarians, because these people are often treated as "all things" by society and deprived of the elegant title of "spirit", but unfortunately, unreasonableness can also come from scholars, high-ranking officials, or people who claim to be civilized, and the degree of unreasonableness of the latter sometimes seems to be even worse than the former.

In the past, those who plotted to seize land, rape women, and monopolize lawsuits, implementing "what is yours is mine, and what is mine is untouchable", were they not all scholars? "Magistrates" could "set fires", while "common people" could not "light lamps"; "a ruler must die when his subject is ordered to die, and a father must die when his son is ordered to die"; "there are no wrong parents in the world"; when an imperial edict came down, those who were slowly executed were still required to kneel three times and kowtow nine times to "thank the emperor" and accept death... All of this was either "sophistry" or harming the "principles" of nature, only slightly better than blocking the road and robbing, demanding "toll money", or having a teahouse "adjudicating" before a full-scale armed fight.

Now, it's even worse, perhaps it's indeed an increase in degree. Let's not talk about anything else, just look at the countries that claim to be the most civilized, their unreasonableness has simply created a new record, not only unprecedented, but also unsurpassed, leaving later generations far behind. They want to destroy other countries at every turn, encompass the lands of other countries, trample on and plunder innocent people, seize all movable property of others, disregard all treaties and agreements, are unwilling to engage in "reasonable" consultation, negotiation, or discussion, and even ignore calls, entreaties, and pleas to them, doing things their own way. What is especially hateful is that they still claim that this is for peace; this is for the stability of a certain region; this is for the happiness of the world: their ruthlessness, wickedness, and violence have truly reached the point where they are beyond "reason"! It's truly like the saying, "The plum tree" is planted in front of their door, therefore, the "reason" in the world is only this one—the Trinity family—and there is no division.

Some "gentlemen", claiming to be kind-hearted, believe that there is only one "right reason" in the world, but there are thousands of "wrong reasons", and they choose to walk where there are more of them, which is their unavoidable situation. If they open up the "right reason" a little and add a few more, they would not only walk the "wrong reason". However, unexpectedly, this only makes things worse: it's like a tiger originally not knowing the taste of human flesh, and a "kind-hearted person" happens to see it hungry and sprinkles some blood for it to eat. Once it tastes it, it simply wants to eat people; it's also like Mr. Dong Guo, who rescued the Zhongshan wolf, and it simply wanted to eat him.

I believe that these unreasonable people definitely have something wrong with their brains; otherwise, why would they disregard human feelings and natural justice like that? The method to deal with them, apart from treating them like patients, and giving them medicine and injections, and giving them considerable persuasion, also requires a head-on blow, to make them suddenly wake up, otherwise, the only option is to lock them up and let them live and die on their own. Because unreasonableness is "barbaric", and to deal with truly "barbaric" people, this is the only way. Unreasonableness is the lack of a sense of right and wrong; "the lack of a sense of right and wrong is not human", and to deal with "non-humans", this is also the only way.

"When a person is about to die, their words are kind." Kindness may be interpreted as "reasonable". Cao Cao, a cunning hero of his time, did many unreasonable things throughout his life. When he was about to die, he had a will to "distribute incense and sell shoes", which was "kind", which was reasonable. I think that the generally unreasonable people of today will probably only realize it when they die!

Then, the "gentlemen" or "kind-hearted people" of today, if they really want to carry the Buddha to the Western Paradise and do it thoroughly, should also find ways to urge these unreasonable people to reach the point of "their words are kind" as soon as possible!

Sexual Hygiene

### Self-Treatment for Sexual Neurasthenia That Affects Human Happiness

— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian University of Labor

The state of sexual neurasthenia is no different from that of general ordinary neurasthenia. The first stage is hypersensitivity of the reproductive organs, early marriage, spermatorrhea, neurosis, and spermatorrhea phenomena. Progressing to the second stage, it is difficult to have sexual intercourse, or lack of semen, decreased libido, and decreased pleasure symptoms that follow.

Spermatorrhea is the hypersensitivity of the sexual organs, which can cause ejaculation with slight stimulation. Early marriage is also due to the same reason. Most of the results can lead to kidney deficiency, especially early marriage. The more persistent sexual neurasthenia is, the more indescribable its state of weakness becomes.

The cause of sexual neurasthenia is mostly due to masturbation. According to patients, the symptoms are roughly the same as those of ordinary neurasthenia, such as heaviness in the head, fatigue in the morning, dizziness, insomnia, spermatorrhea, central palpitation, and loss of appetite. During sexual intercourse, there is premature ejaculation and impotence. Severe symptoms can lead to the danger of infertility.

Speaking of the general treatment methods for the above symptoms, they all involve nourishing tonics, hygienic exercise, avoiding overwork of the mind and body, ensuring bowel movements, avoiding the use of irritating foods, and using hormone agents. But no matter how various hygienic exercises are used, the German testicular essence preparation for men, "Butikang", is indispensable. It is an indispensable medicine. This medicine was invented by the German physiologist Dr. Mellen with 30 years of experience. In addition to using the testosterone of strong animals, its composition also incorporates precious mineral and plant tonics that meet biological standards, such as phosphorus and calcium.

Since "Butikang" for men is a metabolic agent, even if it is not a patient with sexual neurasthenia, if an elderly person uses it, they can also expect to live to a ripe old age.

Although sexual work is a human responsibility, excessive indulgence is harmful and useless. Excessive sexual desire can weaken a man's energy, and at the same time, it also exhausts women. Therefore, for those who indulge in lust, the activity function of the sexual nerves must also be low. In order to prevent premature aging, it is very effective to supplement it with "Butikang". The female version can regulate menstruation and plant seeds, and relieve anorgasmia. It heals anemia and breast lumps with one dose. This is truly a gynecological holy medicine.

Modern Medicine

### New Theory of Gonorrhea Treatment

American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

The meaning of the two words "treating gonorrhea" is indeed a matter worthy of study in the treatment of gonorrhea. There are two reasons for this: one is the superficial treatment of gonorrhea, and the other is the complete treatment of gonorrhea. Local treatment of gonorrhea is only temporarily effective, and often has many reactions. However, because patients see that it is slightly effective, they are often completely unaware of the danger. By the time the gonorrhea poison spreads internally, the patient's physical strength is reduced due to various adverse reactions. Therefore, we often see many patients taking inferior medicines, and just as the patient is getting a slight effect, complications arise amidst the joy. As a result, they are shocked and regret it, and seek other solutions.

The true treatment of gonorrhea must be based on the truth of gonorrhea, and must not use a piecemeal method to solve gonorrhea. Then any gonorrhea can be removed in one fell swoop, to avoid persistent recurrences. Dr. Peter of Germany, based on the non-specific therapy of gonorrhea poison, uses a protein-pigment mixture to make "Kelinong". The so-called non-specific therapy occupies the most superior position in the treatment of gonorrhea. Because after taking it, it can enhance the patient's own cell anti-gonorrhea function, so this treatment of gonorrhea is both extremely proper and thorough. In general, acute urethritis anterior, urethritis posterior, orchitis, cystitis, prostatitis, etc., and the transformation of these symptoms into chronic, secondary or complicated symptoms, taking "Kelinong" can absolutely cure it fundamentally in the short term. On the one hand, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used externally, and "Kaxuedi Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally for female gonorrhea leukorrhea, so the effect is even more rapid!

### Lung Disease Cure Report

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Patient Lin Haiqing, 23 years old, from Wuxi, resides on Xinzha Road in this city (self-reported) Had a slight cough a year ago, which was very rare and mild, so he did not pay attention to it, but his body became thinner and weaker, and he easily became tired. Although he had taken cod liver oil on the market, it did not have much effect. Last autumn, due to mental stimulation, the symptoms deteriorated day by day. Every afternoon, his cheeks were flushed, and he often had night sweats at night, and his appetite decreased greatly. There was a lot of thick sputum, and he often coughed up a little blood, so he came for treatment. (Treatment process) I first measured his body temperature, which was normal in the morning, and often between 39 and 40 degrees in the afternoon. After checking with X-rays, I found two cavities in the lungs, and diagnosed it as third-stage lung disease. I ordered him to rest quietly, take in nutritious foods, and take a large amount of "Bufei Nar", and he recovered after five days of treatment.

### Treatment for Prostatic Leakage

— Dr. Zheng Ting, Medical Doctor of Germany

The prostate gland is in front of the bladder, and there are many nerves around it. Those who masturbate excessively or have excessive sexual intercourse will cause local neurasthenia and loss of control, so it is easy to leak. According to expert research, the so-called spermatorrhea is a symptom of chronic prostatitis. Such as gonorrhea, bladder diseases, excessive sexual intercourse, masturbation, etc., can make the prostate gland likely to develop chronic inflammation. Patients with this disease not only often have seminal fluid flowing out of the urethral opening, but also have various neurological symptoms. Such as decreased libido, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, kidney atrophy, back pain, headache, backache, dizziness, palpitations, fatigue, and terror ideas. The patient's temperament is also becoming more and more gloomy and worried, and they often have a pessimistic view of their personal destiny, feeling that their illness is too severe, and their mental activity is reduced as a result, and pessimism often occurs as a result.

The first treatment for this disease is to clear the mind and reduce desires, so as to avoid stimulation of the local nerves. As for drug treatment, only "Nais Yijing Tablets" have a definite effect. This agent functions to consolidate the essence gate, reduce the hypersensitivity of the erection nerves, and can stop any severe spermatorrhea and spermatorrhea immediately after taking it, and has the effect of calming the brain nerves, so that those with habitual insomnia have a full opportunity to be treated. Therefore, its effect is a hundred times better than essence-solidifying tablets. Those who have taken various essence-solidifying tablets on the market without effect may wish to try this product.

Gonorrhea Forum

### A Comparative View of Internal and External Gonorrhea Treatment

— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

A disease has one treatment, and a disease also has two treatments, but the purpose of the treatment is nothing more than to fundamentally solve the disease being treated. This is true for other diseases, and especially true for gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is a disease with many unpredictable changes, and a scientific method must be used to find out the truth about gonorrhea. Therefore, the treatment for gonorrhea can also be symptomatic. Internal medicine therapy should be used when internal medicine therapy is needed, and external treatment should be used when external treatment is needed, or a combination of internal and external treatment should be used. In short, take a picture and you're done.

Speaking only of internal and external treatment methods, the internal medicine method aims to select drugs. These drugs must be tested and introduced by world-renowned physicians to be reliable. In this regard, the one that is generally praised and used is the gonorrhea holy agent "Kelinong". The principle of invention of "Kelinong" is based on non-specific therapy, and is made by mixing protein and yellow pigment. The function is to generate anti-gonorrhea phagocytic action after taking it. Therefore, this action can reach deep tissues, so gonorrhea in the deep parts of each part does not need to be treated with external surgery (in fact, external surgery is also useless) and can be completely and fundamentally cured. As for external therapy, German static electricity can be called the best among them. Because static electricity therapy is good at sweeping away all the gonorrhea remaining in the urethra. Therefore, the combined use of the two can achieve the best of both worlds. However, if you only take "Kelinong", use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and for female gonorrhea leukorrhea, use "Kaxuedi Vaginal Tablets" externally as a suppository, you can also thoroughly remove gonorrhea from the urethra or the vagina. I specialize in the study of gonorrhea, and I cannot say that my experience with gonorrhea is not much. Therefore, I dare to describe its general meaning here. Consultation hours: 10 am to 6 pm. Send 20 numbers for consultation every day, and only take 5 yuan for each number.

Life Report

### Street Salesman

— Xin Liang

Business is slow, causing the machines to stop. I constantly worry that the boss will tell me to get lost!

First of all, I absolutely believe that nine out of ten people regard the business of "street sales" as one of the lowest and most humble professions. Isn't that so? In the minds of the general public, the "street salesman" is just like a begging "beggar". He has to endure scolding from other people's families, but he cannot help but show a very polite and humble attitude. He has to endure the contempt of other people's families, and he has to swallow those embarrassing words... In short, although we use the term "Mr." to address "street salesmen", their lives are really hard and pitiful.

Don't look at them sitting in carriages with white silk wheels and black-painted bodies, and immediately speculate that their lives are probably very wealthy and comfortable. Does the "street salesman" really feel happy and cheerful? On the surface, he is sometimes mistaken for a big errand in a big foreign company or a big company; sometimes, people see them carrying a black leather bag full of things, and may even think of them as a professor in a university; but in fact, is the "street salesman" really so extravagant? No, absolutely not. This carriage is not his own. The entire property of a "street salesman" is just a dirty black robe and a pair of cloth shoes with holes. When the car stops, he will be scolded and looked down upon. Where can he talk about any prestige or extravagance?

"The business in the shop has been really slow lately! Wasn't it still busy with two machines running on this day last year? But now, it seems that one machine is still running lazily. If this continues, what other solution is there other than closing down?"

These words from the boss really made my heart jump uneasily. Although I can argue with the boss that these days are really different from previous years. It is difficult to do all kinds of business, and the printing industry is no exception, right? The number of competitors has increased, and business is certainly being taken away a lot... But isn't the job of a "street salesman" to drum up business? If business is slow, causing the machines to stop, the boss probably always thinks that the "street salesman" is useless.

In fact, the worries of every "street salesman" are much greater than the worries of the boss. The "street salesman" knows very well that if he does not work hard to drum up business, his job is sure to be broken!

So, when there is nothing that can be done, you still have to find a way! It is indeed too difficult to find "new customers", then, let's go to those "old customers" and see if there is any business to be done.

The carriage dragged me to the door of every "old customer":

"Oh, Mr., are you busy! It's been a long time since we've met, how have you been lately?" I used a very gentle voice, very respectfully, and very humbly to greet an "old customer".

"Hmm!" A lifeless reply.

"The business in the shop has been really slow lately. Can Mr. help me with some business here?" I continued to say in a polite tone. I hope that this "old customer" can then come up with many things that he wants to print.

"Business? It's all been snatched away by other people. I was originally planning to give it to you to print; but other people's prices are really too cheap, and the delivery is also quick. When the boss sees this situation, of course he always thinks of asking cheaper people to print!"

These few sentences were like a basin of cold water poured on my face, making my heart feel extremely depressed and trembling. Doesn't the boss in the shop often scold me for setting the prices too honestly and too cheaply? He said: "This kind of price will not only not get the so-called 'benefits', but it is also very likely to lose money. You really must not 'reduce the price' so recklessly next time. You have to be careful!" Customers scold me for the price being too high, and the boss scolds me for the price being too low. Really, they are all attacking the "street salesman".

Also, when someone who prints things has just given you the sample to print, they are urging you to deliver the goods quickly. The price goes without saying that it must be the cheapest, even if it is cheap enough to make the boss lose money. At the same time, the delivery must be "fast": then you have to add "night work"! But opening night work requires double pay, and the boss is naturally very well-behaved. He will never do that, then, no matter how quickly you hurry, the delivery date will always be a few days later than the originally agreed date. As a result, it is again the "street salesman" who is unlucky and gets scolded.

Sometimes, I really can't bear it, and I want to quit this "begging" job, I would rather not do it. But I don't have this courage. This job also took a lot of effort to find. Although the money is little, isn't my wife and children at home living on these earnings? I can't not do this business, I can't bear other people's scolding and contempt....

Business is slow, causing the machines to stop... I constantly worry that the boss will tell me to get lost!

### Explanation of Peace

— Buddha

U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated in a speech that the peace we seek, a peace based on understanding, is not a peace of surrendering to superior force.

Mussolini explained peace as Germany and Italy desiring peace, but being prepared to seek it by force if necessary.

While it is a established truth that peace must be maintained by force, seeking peace through force is truly unheard of in the world. As the saying goes, "No fight, no acquaintance." Is the attainment of peace truly to be learned from the barrel of a gun? I will watch with bated breath for this peace.

### After the Rain, Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 10: A Mother with a Chignon and Blue Skirt is Wise and Kind; An Old Man with Silver Beard and Emerald Sleeves is a Paragon

Village Chief Zhu said, "That's true! Although he's the village chief of Water Bamboo Village, his wife actually manages many of the village affairs. Originally, although he's from Water Bamboo Village, he didn't live in the countryside. It was after marrying Xie Ayu that he came to live in the countryside. His wife said: Anyway, you have no money left and you're getting old. It's better to live in seclusion in the countryside and not worry about anything. You and I can at least contribute a small part to the country, and the rest of your life can be considered as extra. Living in the countryside, Xie Ayu takes care of this old man very well, like a nanny raising an infant. Unexpectedly, nurturing and nurturing, she actually nurtured an infant." Village Chief Zhu's words made everyone laugh. Zhu Aiqun said, "That old Village Chief Xu is really like a child at home. Even eating and dressing are taken care of by his wife. For example, when eating, his wife only allows him to eat two bowls, and he doesn't dare to eat a third. For example, when dressing, he doesn't pay much attention when the weather suddenly turns cold or warm, but his wife is always mindful. Sometimes he doesn't want to wear it, and she has to coax him like a child to get him to wear it. Also, when old Village Chief Xu comes out, his wife often accompanies him." Village Chief Zhu said, "That's also true! I remember on the third day of the third month this year, when our Freedom Village held the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the new village, we invited 33 village chiefs from neighboring villages, and old Xu also came. His wife also accompanied him. People who didn't know would have thought it was a granddaughter accompanying her grandfather. Who would know they were husband and wife? I saw that she paid close attention to the old man's diet and daily life, just like Aiqun said, like taking care of a child. At our meeting, we invited village chiefs from various villages because there were many things that needed to be jointly organized by various villages, not just things unique to one village. Just like the various countries of the world have international affairs, our various villages also have inter-village affairs. Such as water conservancy, farmland, sanitation, education, etc., there are plenty of things that can be jointly organized by contacting various villages. Therefore, we often hold this village chief joint meeting. Whenever Village Chief Xu comes to this meeting, his wife always accompanies him. Sometimes he simply doesn't come, and his wife represents him, which shows that his wife knows more than he does." He Shuangyu said, "Huh! She's here to represent the village chief, so can a woman be a village chief?" Village Chief Zhu said, "Why not? Among the 33 village chiefs this time, five are women. What can't women do now? Just like the affairs of old man Xu, aren't they all managed by his wife!" (117)

### More on the Demolition Wave in Qingyu Lane

— Cai Qing

Regarding the demolition dispute in Qingyu Lane, from the Women's Bank's warning against demolition, Mr. Yu Qiaqing's unsuccessful mediation, to the unfortunate events of forced demolition, beatings, and cutting off water and electricity, it seems that there is no hope for a peaceful resolution.

In fact, the Women's Bank is well aware that after the demolition of houses in Qingyu Lane, more than 3,000 tenants in this pigeonhole-like Shanghai have nowhere to live. The reason why the Women's Bank insists on demolition is because of the contractual relationship with the Poor Children's Education Institute. Therefore, the biggest key lies here. As the Qingyu Lane tenants' advertisement requesting support from all sectors says, in this "turbulent world and repeated disasters," is the Poor Children's Education Institute determined to fulfill the contract signed with the Women's Bank? Judging from the advertisements of both sides, the Poor Children's Education Institute seems to have never stood up and said a definite word.

Naturally, legally speaking, the signed contract must be fulfilled. The more than 3,000 tenants in Qingyu Lane should have left long ago, or gone to the refugee camps. It is superfluous to complain in the newspapers. But since we are all Chinese, the miserable situation of "living in turbulent times and suffering repeated disasters" should be witnessed even if not personally experienced. The Poor Children's Education Institute is a charitable organization, so it should make every effort to provide immediate relief to refugees. Moreover, the tenants in Qingyu Lane are not living there for free.

Therefore, the greatest power to resolve this issue lies in the hands of the Poor Children's Education Institute, and seeking an answer from this focus is also the quickest shortcut. Naturally, what I mean is: let's temporarily abandon the law and talk about humanity.

### Poor Children's Unemployed Relief Center

— Simon

Establish Ten Free Primary Schools; Publicly Recruit Principals and Teachers

Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, countless poor children have lost their schooling. Recently, enthusiastic people in society have organized a Shanghai Poor Children's Unemployed Relief Center, which has decided to establish more than a dozen free primary schools starting next semester. At the same time, from the 20th of this month, it will publicly recruit principals and teachers. The registration office is located on the fifth floor of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association on Avenue Edward VII.

It is said that since Ma Xiangbo, Zhang Shouyong, Wu Yunzhai, Dai Chunfeng, and others have successively donated scholarships to the Poor Children's Unemployed Relief Center, the advancement of various tasks has become smoother. Recently, it has been decided to expand the scope of relief. Starting next semester, Shanghai will be divided into ten districts, with ten free schools established in each district, each school with a quota of 200 students, and all expenses will be waived. The first district will be named Model Primary School, the second district National Construction Primary School, the third district Rejuvenation Primary School, the fourth district Cooperation Primary School, the fifth district Datong Primary School, the sixth district Thrift Primary School, the seventh district Loyalty Primary School, the eighth district Love and Assistance Primary School, the ninth district Faith and Righteousness Primary School, and the tenth district Peace Primary School.

For the sake of pooling wisdom and concentrating talent, the Relief Center has separately hired enthusiastic educators to serve as preparatory committee members and publicly recruited enthusiastic free educators to serve as principals or teachers. Since this news came out, many people have gone to obtain regulations or register. On the afternoon of the first day of registration, the author also went to the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, took the elevator straight to the fifth floor, and found No. 519, with a sign at the door that read "Office of the Shanghai Poor Children's Unemployed Relief Center." Walking inside, the place was quite small. Several young men and women were already inside asking for regulations and filling out forms, and some were asking an officer about the establishment of free primary schools. I also asked the officer for a copy of the regulations.

It is said that anyone who has always been interested in free education and has served in the education field, regardless of gender, can fill out a form to apply. In addition to filling out the application form and stating their resume, they must also prepare a weekly course schedule according to their specialties, from the first grade to the sixth grade of elementary school. After passing the application, they will be hired by the center as principals or teachers and start preparing for the opening of school. In the future, the location of the school will also be the responsibility of the principals and teachers who have passed the application to find. The daily class time is stipulated from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, a total of three hours, so that it will not conflict with the original class time. Although it is said to be volunteering, each teacher also has a monthly subsidy of 10 to 25 yuan, which will be determined by the Relief Center after the school opens. However, after passing the application, they must also find a qualified guarantor to guarantee faithful service.

Indeed, there are many poor children in Shanghai today who are displaced, out of school, and have lost their parents. The children of today are the masters of the country in the future. Whether we stand on human compassion or on the perspective of the country or society, we should do our best to help these large numbers of out-of-school poor children. Now that the Poor Children's Unemployed Relief Center is actively carrying out relief work, it is certainly good news for out-of-school children, but in order to achieve good results, it still needs the support of people in society. Those with money should donate money, and those with strength should do some volunteer work, so that this work can proceed smoothly and achieve unexpected results in the future.

The Entertainment World

Gossip About Drama in the Isolated Island

### Casual Talk About the Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights

— Weiwei

Unexpectedly, Liu Hanchen, after returning to Shanghai from Tianjin and starring alone in "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" at the Tianchan Stage, actually sold out for more than a dozen consecutive performances. It can be said that Liu Hanchen gave Tianchan a life-saving shot. In my opinion, there are several reasons why "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" can sell:

(1) "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" is a play focused on martial arts scenes. Tianchan Stage has Liu Hanchen, Wang Guiqing, Gao Xueqiao, Wang Fuying, and Dong Zhiyang, all of whom have different styles but are all popular martial arts performers. Shanghai people love to watch exciting entertainment, so this play sells because these martial arts performers really have considerable appeal.

(2) Liu Hanchen "goes all out" in every performance, using all his strength and giving his all. This is something that no one else can match, and it suits the taste of some people in Shanghai.

(3) In the eyes of laymen, it is absolutely difficult to distinguish the skills of Liu Hanchen, Wang Guiqing, Gao Xueqiao, and Wang Fuying. Because everyone wants to please the audience, they are all overcome by a desire to win and are unwilling to relax on stage. The actors and the audience (especially those in the same profession) compete with each other on stage, each showing their talents, and naturally, there are wonderful moments, which can satisfy the audience in the audience.

(4) The script of "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" is quite tightly arranged, and the scenery and props are also excellent, all above the "Red Robe" and "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea" previously performed by Tianchan.

Because of the above reasons, "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" can make a lot of money. It is not surprising that a theater performs a large play and sells out for several consecutive performances. However, it is worth studying that Liu Hanchen, who has not been appreciated by the public in the past, has achieved such amazing results by being the leading performer at Tianchan Stage.

— Reflections After Watching the Sunday Theater

This Sunday, the Sunday Experimental Theater of the Shanghai Drama Society performed three one-act plays by the Shanghai Jiaoyi Society: one was "Little Scene on a Snowy Night" by Zhang Min, one was the collective creation "Tears of a Dancing Girl" by the Shanghai Drama Society; and the third was "Mother" adapted by Tian Han.

The backstage lighting, scenery, props, makeup, etc., were still the responsibility of the Shanghai Drama Society.

Actors from the Shanghai Drama Society, such as Xia Xia, Lan Lan, Zhang Wanjun, Shu Yin, Tu Guangqi, Ding Zhi, Xu Li, Zhou Qi, etc., were also present. Now let's talk about the performance of the three plays:

(1) "Little Scene on a Snowy Night" - This is a one-act play, and there is only one actor. It is just like "Before Breakfast." When an actor has to support a stage, it is relatively difficult. If the story and dialogue written by the playwright are too plain and simple, or if the director cannot grasp the atmosphere of the play (lighting, music, the actor's position, the pitch of the voice, the speed of the action), then this building supported by one person will definitely make the audience feel lonely and empty.

"Little Scene on a Snowy Night" has a new type of writing, almost using the brushstrokes of a comic strip, lightly sketching a snowy night, a poor mother, without money, without legs, painfully sending her child to the nursery. The emotions are quite tragic, but this is only a small poem and does not become a good story.

Therefore, it gives the audience the impression of coldness and emptiness.

The director also cannot let go of the position of this only actor, always letting her stand in a corner, which is also not good. The actress Ye Qi is capable of acting.

(2) "Tears of a Dancing Girl" - The script is different from the one performed by the dancing girls themselves last time. In particular, the writing has been strengthened after Manli's abortion. Her dance customer, Xiao Chen, still comes to quarrel with her and says that he will not marry her. Manli's crying, laughing, burning photos, and tearing up fake passbooks have added a lot of power to the whole play.

Among the three plays, "Tears of a Dancing Girl" should be considered the best.

Among the actors, Yin Lan, who played Manli, was the most successful; the director also handled the manic laughter of Manli with great power; Yin Lan grasped such personalities as sorrow, desolation, resentment, and anger. In the middle of the burning photos, the music rose up, and the tragic atmosphere was unusually strong. The other actors were all very experienced, such as Xia Wen's Manli and Shen Mo's mother. Yin Qing, who played Linlin, lacked emotion in her speech and even didn't know how to read the lines; her speech was also too low. For example, when she told Manli about her experience of being deceived by a dance customer in Hong Kong, it can be seen that she lacked experience.

(3) "Mother" - The story tells that in the old Russian era, a mother often suffered humiliation and beatings from three generations. Later, her only son finally realized and used new power to save his mother, who had always been bullied by men.

The script is very powerful, but because the several main actors are too weak, the whole play is soft and powerless.

Especially the one who played the father, Mikhail, although he roared violently on the stage, he lacked emotion, such as his laughter, his beating his wife, and his pronunciation suddenly high and low, making the whole play a failure.

Bai Li's mother was very painful and delicate in her performance. Her timidity, terror, and grief were able to grasp the characteristics of a woman living under male violence.

### Mao Shilai's Iron Bow Marriage

— Ce Hai

Mao Shilai came to Shanghai for the second time, accompanied by Sha Shixin, Gao Shenglin, etc., and performed at the Golden Stage. Because of the difficulty of getting a good seat, it was not until the third day that Mao performed "Iron Bow Marriage" that I was able to watch it. That night, it was suitable for the sound of cranes and the sound of the wind, and the iron net was densely covered. The Golden Stage opened the show early. When I entered the seat at 8:00, I did not see Yan Shishan's performance and Gao Shenglin's eight big hammer car battles. What I saw was only two episodes of "Iron Bow Marriage" by Sha Shixin, Gao Shenglin, Mao Shilai, Jiang Shiyu, Ai Shiju, and Qiu Shengrong. Shixin's makeup was clean and emaciated, and his work was also calm and restrained, not as gentle as Fuying, but slightly more handsome than Lian Liang. Unfortunately, his voice was weak, even worse than Zhou Xiaotian. Only the first few rows could distinguish his singing and pronunciation, and the rear rows could only see his actions. The lifting of the hair when cutting off his arm was clean and agile, but the arm was not thrown up, which was a slight imperfection. Shenglin's Lu Wenlong was slightly less handsome in his makeup, and his acting and singing were only adequate. Sitting and listening to Wang Zuo's storytelling scene, he frequently straightened his clothes, his attitude seemed cramped, I don't know why.

Mao Shilai's "Iron Bow Marriage" was popular when he came to Shanghai last time. This performance is even more refined. His voice is also clearer than before. After a year of separation, he should be admired. This play is very heavy, focusing on its key points. The first half focuses on the test of the bow and marriage, which must be performed with romantic amorous feelings. In the second half, he changes clothes and abandons the marriage, with the female role playing the male role. Shilai's performance, from beginning to end, is impeccable. I especially like the play of tying the belt in the second half, with the opening, fighting, dialogue, and expression all washing away the affectation of the female role. When the real and fake Zhengfu meet, he simultaneously manipulates two voices, speaking in the female role's vernacular to his mother, and changing to the male role's tone to Wang. The mixing and changing of rigidity, softness, yin, and yang is his special skill. The audience applauded, and I also applauded.

The Hollywood Fencing Team will be organized tomorrow, and the picture above shows Team A members practicing attack methods.

"The Misanthrope" will be performed soon. "The Misanthrope," a satirical comedy by the great French writer Molière, is a famous play that Shanghai drama audiences have long been looking forward to. It is now known that the Shanghai University Literary Society and the Haiyan Drama Club have jointly rehearsed the play, directed by the famous actor Meng He. It is said that it has been decided to perform it at the Grand Auditorium of the French Municipal Council at No. 11 Huanlong Road in the French Concession.

### Extra Records of the Pear Garden

Two Notable Things About the Late Righteous Actor Luo Kuifang

The two were arguing when suddenly a certain lady walked into the room, and the maid hurriedly exited. Xiao Bao was very familiar with the lady, and sometimes when a certain gentleman was out, the lady would also come to talk to him a few words, so he did not mind seeing the lady enter. However, today's situation was different from the past. First, it was late at night and the master had not returned. Second, he suddenly ordered the maid to give him money. Third, when he repeatedly wanted to leave, the lady always tried to stop him, saying that a certain gentleman would return soon, and that a phone call had come asking him to wait a little longer. Seeing that it was already three or four in the morning, a certain gentleman had not yet returned to the residence. He repeatedly urged the servant to return to his room and go to bed early, allowing him to wait here alone, but the lady ignored him. Later, she actually lay down and wanted to help him fill his pipe. How could he dare to accept it? After a while, the lady actually stood up and went to bolt the door. Xiao Bao was a smart person, and he understood everything. At this time, his heart was uneasy, and he thought to himself how kind a certain gentleman was to him, and the lady was also a lady of a large family, who usually treated him very well. Today, due to a moment of thought, she suddenly had an evil thought, which is something that women may have. However, I, Luo, must not be as confused as she is. While she is still undecided and has not taken any action, it is better to plan a way to escape this situation quickly. After thinking about it, he deliberately packed two large pipes of tobacco and smoked them one after another. He immediately stood up and said that he was dizzy, and he also made a look of standing unsteadily. The lady ignored everything and used her hand to pull him down to sleep, saying that he would be fine after lying down for a while. At this moment, Xiao Bao suddenly somersaulted and fell to the ground, immediately losing consciousness and frothing at the mouth, as if his old epilepsy had relapsed. The lady knew that he had this disease, and she also saw that his head was broken and bleeding profusely. She was also frightened at the time, and hurriedly pried open the door and called in the servants, who used a car to take him to the hospital for treatment. This suspense ended like a wind. After a few days, Xiao Bao still went on stage to perform, with a plaster on his forehead. This is a memento of this incident. Later, a certain lady understood and respected his character even more. Xiao Bao's quick wit to save himself and others, and his righteous act of knowing gratitude and not coveting other people's wives, are not common in the world of actors, let alone in this evil society. He was able to fight for his personality and was unwilling to be a plaything when he was young, so he later dared not play with women even more. A person's behavior before and after is related. It is a pity that he died too early. If he had died a few years later, he could have earned a lot of money just by recording records and teaching drama. Furthermore, his Tan-style opera was really authentic. Anyone who wanted to indulge in opera but could not hear Shu Yan's singing could often listen to a few of his specialties in Shanghai to satisfy their cravings. Moreover, he was slightly better than Shu Yan in some aspects. ——(18)——

### The Age of Female Stars

— Wan Yu

Women like to shorten their age the most, even if the beauty of their appearance has become an irrefutable ironclad proof, they still reluctantly say a few years less before they feel happy. From this point, we can understand the common fear of aging among women. The reason is that women adorn themselves for the pleasure of others, and who doesn't hope to show their beauty and youth under makeup? However, good times don't last long, and it is the fleeting youth that ages most easily under the frequent changes of years. So, when their beautiful youth has passed and their beauty has declined, they know that their golden age has passed, but they still smile reluctantly and try their best to discount their age in front of others, comforting themselves in vain.

Chinese empresses, of course, cannot avoid the faults they say! Most of them want to preserve their youth. Why are men unique? (Editor's note: old age,) Who wants it? Neglecting their own position, not knowing how to strive for status and reputation in art, and only showing off their beauty to the audience, as if they want the audience to regard them as just sixteen-year-old girls every year! In fact? The audience is not blind, although the illusion reflected on the screen after they have undergone makeup and beauty treatments is much younger, but the constantly increasing years will not fail to leave traces on the faces of female stars.

59th Game Five Rats and Five Righteous Men

Proposed by Xue Weihan

Red Moves First to Win

The solution will be revealed tomorrow.

Explanation of Games 36 and 37

There are records in old chess manuals of the Screen Horse formation breaking the Central Cannon, but there is no record of the Central Cannon breaking the Screen Horse. Based on factual research, since the Screen Horse can break the Central Cannon, the Central Cannon can also break the Screen Horse. According to the editor's experience, the Screen Horse is not necessarily able to break the Central Cannon, but only the Screen Horse can best resist the Central Cannon. The Screen Horse has many variations and is extremely difficult to use. The games recorded in the manual are only to show scholars various methods of using the horse. Therefore, the Central Cannon often hides superfluous moves (useless moves), and it is extremely difficult for those with shallow artistic knowledge to identify them. If there are no hidden superfluous moves, then both sides are evenly matched, and neither side has any chance of winning. The manual does not have the Central Cannon breaking the Screen Horse, not because the Central Cannon cannot break the Screen Horse. Looking at the various games in the manual where the Screen Horse breaks the Central Cannon, there are many variations in the Cannon's moves, but the method of advancing the middle soldier and directly attacking the middle road is rarely seen. Advancing the middle soldier to take the middle road is the most taboo for the Screen Horse. The editor's various methods of the Screen Horse competing for the first move against the Central Cannon allow both sides to display their strengths. They are novel and ingenious, all derived from experience and will never be the same as the old manual. This game is the method of the Central Cannon obtaining the first move. From Cannon 2 to 5 to Chariot 2 to 7, as mentioned earlier, Soldier 7 advances one and Soldier 5 advances one, the Cannon obtains the first move. At this time, the Screen Horse is constantly forced, showing the need to compete for the first move, without relaxing a step.

Advancing the Elephant 4 to 5 and the Horse 3 to 4 are both inevitable. Advancing the Soldier 5 to 1 to Chariot 7 to 1 is a method of obtaining the first move by sending the middle soldier with the patrolling river Chariot. It is a new situation and is indeed an experienced move.

### Chinese People Plan to Build a Theater in France

The number of Chinese merchants in Paris is truly numerous and countless. Now, there is a plan to build a theater in the city as a place for performances, entertainment, and relaxation. A Western newspaper stated: "The Chinese actors are exquisitely dressed, their skills are refined, and they are extremely pleasing to the eye, worthy of praise!" It also said: "The Chinese who have established shops in Paris are as numerous as scales on a fish; their buying and selling of goods is increasing day by day, making it a true hub for merchants."

### Woman Disguised as a Man

On the eighth day, a strange case was heard at the Mixed Court, worthy of attention. It involved a female server disguised as a man, sent by the police station. Magistrate Chen ascended to the court and interrogated her. According to her confession, her name was Zhou Xiaoda, from Suzhou, 24 years old. She worked as a female server at the Fengxiantai opium den in the French Concession outside Xiaodongmen. On that day, Chen Xiaoyu, a Huizhou man from Kaiyuantai Clothing Store on Dong Street in the city, who knew her, wanted her to dress as a man for fun and offered her ten silver dollars. So he brought her boots, hats, robes, and jackets, which she wore. They went together to Zuichuju on the Great Road to smoke opium, where they were apprehended by the police. Magistrate Chen was furious, saying that the female servers had already caused harm, yet she dared to be so flamboyant. He immediately ordered her to be beaten several hundred times and prepared a document to be sent to the county for strict handling, in order to rectify public morals. When she was escorted to the court, the onlookers were like a wall. The female server, Zhou Xiaoda, wore a red felt wind hat, a blue crepe horse-hoof-sleeved leather robe, a sky-blue satin leather vest, and satin boots. Her swaying gait made it difficult to distinguish her gender. Her capture at the time must have been due to her strolling about with ease, leading to her being exposed. Currently, gentry and merchants are urgently requesting a ban on female servers, but this female server is still so unscrupulous, it is unknown what she relies on. Her being sent to the county for strict investigation may slightly alleviate this trend. As for the Chen man who incited her to gamble, if it is true, it can be said to be a cruel joke.
