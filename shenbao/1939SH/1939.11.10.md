The Chinese army valiantly intercepted and fought fiercely throughout the day, ultimately defeating all the stubborn Japanese troops, who retreated in disarray towards Zitong, Xiadian, and the "West of Xiangyuan" areas. In addition, over four hundred Japanese troops from Liaoxian invaded south in three routes on the 2nd, but were routed by the Chinese army.

Xingji: In the second half of last month, the Chinese and Japanese armies fought fiercely for five days and nights along the line from Yanzhang, Laotaimiao, Gengnanguo, and Peishe in the southeast of Wenxi. The Chinese army achieved a complete victory. The course of events was as follows: Starting on the 22nd, over eight hundred Japanese troops gathered at Yanzhang and Laotaimiao, and harassed the area around Nanguo and Peishe. The Chinese garrison immediately rose up to resist forcefully, and fierce fighting broke out between the two sides. The Chinese army charged repeatedly, and the Japanese army retreated to Daxiaozhe. On the 23rd, over two thousand reinforcements were urgently dispatched from Xiaxian and Wenxi, along with thirty tanks and armored vehicles and over twenty aircraft. On the 25th, spearheaded by tanks, supported by aircraft, and coordinated by infantry, cavalry, and artillery, they launched a fierce attack on Nanguo, Peishe, Xiaowang and other villages. Chinese officers and soldiers engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat with the stubborn Japanese troops, and the fighting was extremely fierce. The Japanese troops advanced and retreated repeatedly, and the position was contested several times. The entire village of Peishe was destroyed by artillery fire. The Japanese once broke in and engaged in street fighting with the Chinese, but were quickly repulsed by the Chinese. As the battle raged until dusk, the Chinese army pressed on with renewed efforts, launching a fierce counterattack, and surrounded the Japanese from both left and right flanks. The stubborn Japanese troops continued to hold out, and after another night of fighting by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops, due to heavy casualties, finally broke through and retreated towards Wenxi at dawn on the 26th. It is estimated that three to four hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. (Reported on the 8th)

### Military Affairs Commission Releases Weekly War Situation Report, Covering November 1st to 7th

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week (November 1st to 7th), there have been no large-scale battles on any front. The Japanese troops in central Hubei and western Shanxi have been dealt heavy blows by the Chinese army and are now exhausted. The war is currently in a stalemate. The more important developments are described below:

Shanxi-Henan Front: The war situation in southeastern Shanxi has recently become quiet. Over a thousand Japanese troops in the Yongji area of southern Shanxi advanced towards Xuehua Mountain in three routes several days ago, but were met by the Chinese army in separate routes, resulting in many casualties. By the 5th, the Japanese troops on all routes had been defeated and routed. Since last week, Japanese troops in western Shanxi launched a large-scale westward offensive from Pu County, Lingshi, and Fencheng in three routes. Their main force successively invaded the counties of Xi, Ji, and Da Ning. Another unit of Japanese troops also occupied Jundu in the north, attempting to threaten the Chinese flank, but after a brave counter-offensive, Jundu was recovered. The Japanese offensive gradually weakened. From the 7th, the Chinese armies on all fronts adopted a tactic of encircling and assaulting the enemy, completely defeating the Japanese troops and restoring the original positions. The Japanese suffered extremely heavy losses. In Shenchi and Wuzhai, in northern Shanxi, a combined force of over a thousand Japanese infantry and artillery advanced towards Sanjingzhen in multiple routes, and were bravely resisted. Another unit of the Chinese army also charged into the western gate of Jingle, killing many Japanese troops. The county seat is still controlled by the Chinese, and the Japanese are extremely panicked. In the area of Huaiyang, Tongxu, Qixian, Taikang, and Chenliu in eastern Henan, the Japanese have gathered four to five thousand troops and harassed the area in all directions over the past week, but have been repulsed by fierce attacks along the way. Another unit of the Chinese army also attacked the town of Baikou in Lanfeng, annihilating the Japanese troops there, and is now advancing towards the county seat.

Hubei Front: On the evening of the 3rd, the Japanese troops trapped in Beigang and Xishan in southern Hubei were subjected to a fierce attack, resulting in fierce fighting throughout the night. By dawn on the 4th, the Japanese abandoned over six hundred corpses and fled towards Tongcheng. Both places were recovered. The Japanese troops in central Hubei advanced towards the Chinese in two routes for several consecutive days. One route proceeded from Hanyangzhen and Caidian, via Jurushan, to attack Pengjiachang. The other route drew Japanese troops from Qianjiang and Hanchuan to force Xiantaozhen, and were supported by multiple Japanese aircraft, launching a combined land and air attack. The vanguard was very aggressive. Pengjiachang and Xiantaozhen fell successively. The vanguard invaded Mianyang and once even infiltrated Fengkou and Tonghaikou. After reinforcements and a counter-attack, fierce fighting ensued for two days and nights, killing over a thousand Japanese troops. Fengkou and Tonghaikou were successively recovered. The Japanese were routed in disarray and the Chinese army is pursuing them in the flush of victory. By noon on the 4th, there were no more traces of the Japanese in the city of Mianyang. The remaining Japanese troops in Xiantaozhen and Pengjiachang were also tightly surrounded and are in a state of collapse. The approximately one thousand troops of the Zhejiang River-style Regiment of the Japanese army in northern Hubei attacked Dushan and Chashan in the south of Suixian for several consecutive days. Both places were once occupied by the Japanese. Starting on the 3rd, the Chinese launched a brave counter-attack and both places were recovered. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue and tightly surround the Zhejiang River. The battle for control was extremely fierce. The Japanese suffered over five hundred casualties. The Chinese captured a large amount of war spoils. (Reported on the 9th) (To be continued)

### Chen Shaokuan's Statement on Naval Achievements

Chongqing: In an article published today in a military monthly magazine, Navy Commander Chen Shaokuan described the Chinese Navy's participation in the current Sino-Japanese War. He stated that before the war, the Chinese Navy was divided into the First, Second, and Training Fleets, with a total of approximately 8,500 officers and soldiers. Some smaller warships were used for coastal patrols. In addition, there were two brigades of marines and two large battalions of reserves. Many Chinese naval officers had received training in the British Navy. After the outbreak of war on August 13, 1937, the Chinese Navy's first action was to sink the old transport ship Pu'an in the southern Huangpu River to protect the flank of the Chinese army in the South City. After August 20, Japanese aircraft targeted the Chinese Navy's various agencies in Shanghai, Mawei, and Xiamen as targets for their air raids. As a result, the naval headquarters, shipyards, hospitals, aircraft factories, marine barracks, and coastal patrol stations were all bombed. On September 29, several Chinese naval personnel carried several mines before dawn, entered the water from Pudong, and swam towards the Japanese cruiser Izumo. When they were thirty yards from the ship, they were discovered by the Japanese, who opened fire with machine guns. These men released the mines, which were carried away by the strong current and missed the ship by a few yards. Chen also stated that the Chinese Navy had gathered along the Yangtze River to prepare for war two days before the outbreak of war, and had removed or destroyed all the pontoons, lightships, water markers, and other navigation markers in the lower reaches of Jiangyin. The next day, a water barrier was built downstream of the Jiangyin Fort, with a total of thirty-five ships, totaling 63,800 tons, sunk. Subsequently, eight tugboats and 185 sailboats, as well as 2,354 tons of stone, were sunk to strengthen the water barrier. (Reuter, 9th)

### British Consul in Kunming Transferred to Tengyue

Kunming: Mr. Stokeley, the acting British Consul-General stationed in Kunming, has been transferred to Tengyue in western Yunnan and departed today. (Reuter, 9th)

### Sino-Soviet Air Service to Open Soon; Construction of Xinjiang Airfield Completed

Chongqing: It was officially announced here today that direct postal and passenger air service between China and the Soviet Union via Xinjiang will be opened soon. The section from Chongqing to Hami will be operated by the Sino-German joint venture Eurasia Aviation Corporation. It is understood that negotiations between the Chinese and Soviet governments on this route have lasted for more than a year. The final preparations for the Sino-Soviet air route were only completed a few months ago after the British Imperial Airways Company and the Chinese government agreed on the Chongqing-Rangoon route. The construction of the Xinjiang airfield has made the official opening of the new route imminent. According to the latest news received here, these airfields have now been completed. Before Germany and the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression treaty, Eurasia's business was not allowed to pass Lanzhou. At that time, it was planned that the Ministry of Communications would operate the route from Chongqing to Hami, but the rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union has apparently overcome this difficulty. (Reuter, 9th)

Chongqing: The Chongqing-Hami (Xinjiang Province) air route will be launched in the near future by Eurasia Aviation Corporation. Eurasia Aviation Corporation had previously opened an air route from Xinjiang Province to the Soviet border several years ago, and had planned to connect with the European air route at the time, but this did not materialize due to the political situation. Now it may be possible. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)

### Chongqing Celebrates Soviet Revolution

Chongqing: According to news received here today, the crowd celebrating the 22nd anniversary of the Soviet Revolution here last night numbered 20,000 people.

At midnight, the Chinese crowd sang the Chinese and Soviet national anthems and dispersed in joy. (Associated Press, 9th)

### Kong Xiangxi Provides Relief to Wounded Soldiers and Refugees

Guilin: Due to the victory in the Battle of Northern Hunan, President Kong has remitted 100,000 to Director Bai to provide relief to wounded soldiers and refugees. Bai telegraphed Kong on the 8th to express his thanks, and has remitted all of these funds to the front lines for proper allocation and distribution. (Reported on the 9th)

### British Ambassador Leaves Chongqing for Hong Kong

Chongqing: British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, accompanied by his secretary Tighe, flew to Hong Kong from here this afternoon. Dong Xianguang represented Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang at the airfield to see him off. In addition, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Executive Yuan were also present. Before his departure, he was entertained by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at a banquet. During his stay in Chongqing, the ambassador met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Foreign Minister Wang, and other senior officials. The ambassador also had lengthy talks with Communist Party leaders Chen Shaoyu and Qin Bangxian. (Reuter, 9th)

Chongqing: British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr left here by plane for Hong Kong today. According to Chinese Foreign Ministry officials, although the British ambassador and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui often met, they did not discuss any particular issues. Such meetings are extremely natural, as the British ambassador is constantly maintaining close contact with the Chinese government. (Associated Press, 9th)

### Yan Huiqing Discusses the Future of the League of Nations

Washington: According to Dr. Yan Huiqing, the chief Chinese delegate to the Pacific International Exchange Conference, it is expected that when the current European war ends, the countries that have suffered from the ravages of war will still turn to the League of Nations for help. "But if the countries of the world still try to establish a League of Nations, then the League of Nations they establish should be a League of Nations with the power to implement peace. Under the organization of this kind of League of Nations, the sovereignty of each country must be sacrificed in part for the common good. In other words, this new League of Nations should be a supra-national state, a supra-national government, and its power to maintain world peace, justice, and reasonable international relations must be greater than that of the current League of Nations. For the happiness of society, individuals are often willing to sacrifice part of their freedom, so certain actions are often decided by the parliament or the police, and there is no regret or complaint. Since individuals can do this, then countries, in order to avoid disaster, can only sacrifice part of their sovereignty for peace and justice. At the same time, in order for this League of Nations to be effective, countries from all over the world should be required to join it." Dr. Yan was invited today to a banquet by Mr. Hamilton, Director of the Far Eastern Department of the US State Department, and Mr. Bake, political adviser to the State Department. (Associated Press, 9th)

### Sichuan Establishes Opium Suppression Inspection Group, Huang Jilu as Head, Hu Ciwei as Deputy; You Ying and Others from the Ministry of Interior Participate in the Work

Chongqing: The six-year deadline for opium suppression is imminent. It is now the end of autumn in the 28th year of the Republic, and according to opium planting customs, it is the time to sow opium seedlings. Previously, the Executive Yuan issued an organizational outline for opium suppression inspection groups to various provinces, instructing the provinces of Sichuan, Kangding, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Fujian to implement it accordingly. The Sichuan group has been established ahead of schedule, divided into ten groups, and with the approval of the Ministry of Interior, the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan have jointly appointed Huang Jilu as the head of the group and Hu Ciwei as the deputy head. The members of the group will be concurrently filled by current personnel recommended by various military, political, and party agencies in Sichuan Province. As the Ministry of Interior is the competent authority for opium suppression, it has now appointed inspectors You Ying, Zhang Dingxin, Huang Junwei, Gao Chaozong, Xie Fu, Pan Jue, Yu Liangmo, Li Wonan, Zhang Xiapu, and Liu Cheng to participate in the aforementioned work. Four days ago, Zhang Weihan, Vice Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Interior, personally visited the Opium Suppression Commission, and together with Standing Committee Member Li Zhonggong, convened the inspectors for a training session, encouraging them to endure hardship, take responsibility, and eradicate opium. They were also instructed to take a special train to Chengdu immediately to await assignment to various counties to supervise and strictly prohibit opium planting. The provinces of Kangding, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Fujian are also being instructed by the Ministry of Interior to the Opium Suppression Commission to begin preparations, and they will be able to proceed in separate routes in the near future.

Editorial

### Japan, the United States, and the Soviet Union

For the past three days, Japanese newspapers have uniformly begun to roar at the United States, saying they are not afraid to fight the United States, saying they will soon be on friendly terms with the Soviet Union. The donkey of Guizhou has exhausted its tricks, putting on a brave face to conceal inner cowardice, making it extremely ugly. However, it should be viewed separately. The government authorities are still reserved.

Japanese diplomacy is actually very shallow, coquettish, and artificial, always trying to use small tricks to deceive the world and fool them, but failing to conceal its beggarly appearance everywhere. Without discussing distant matters, let us describe recent events: From the launching of the military invasion of China to the occupation of Wuhan, in the midst of their intoxicated dreams, like a poor child suddenly becoming rich, walking with high heads and arrogance, regarding any other country or any other matter with contempt. This was the scene half a year ago. And the United States announced the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, and the Soviet Union and Germany signed a non-aggression agreement. Although they tried to maintain their stern posture, they were still wandering on the streets, not knowing where to go. The Hiruma cabinet fell and the Abe cabinet took power, actually planning to change their style and seek international acceptance. But before long, the European war broke out, and they gained another dreamland, thinking that fate had given them an opportunity to manipulate. Who knew that they would be defeated militarily in northern Hunan, and warned internationally by the United States, and so they had to find another way. Where is that other way? The German route just led into a trap, the British and French route was slow to help. These two can only be used as tools of diplomatic magic. Beyond these two, only the Soviet Union and the United States remained. The Soviet Union is not an easy acquaintance, and Japanese national and social education for the past twenty years has created "an irreconcilable hatred between the Soviet Union and Japan." Therefore, only the United States remained. The United States, the country to whom Japan bows to the extreme. On October 20, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew gave a frank and clear public warning. The Japanese did not get angry or resentful, but praised it as "frank." On November 4, Ambassador Grew met with Foreign Minister Nomura and made a written summary of the public warning. The Japanese said that the prospect of establishing mutual understanding between the U.S. and Japan was very bleak. In the following two or three days, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman successively hinted at concrete actions against Japan. House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Vinson revealed a large-scale naval expansion plan. All of these are what Japan cannot withstand. On November 8, Japanese newspapers pretended to attack the United States. How did they attack the U.S.? They said they would contact the Soviet Union. The authorities are reserved, but Japan is not a country with freedom of speech.

The above shows the recent actions of Japanese diplomacy. How could it be called diplomacy? The sun is setting and the road is long. It seizes its national destiny and the lives of its people to "charge wildly" and "ram wildly." Well done, the United States responded to their roars by formally announcing yesterday from Washington that they would strengthen air and naval forces in the Pacific!

Japan recklessly charges and rams wildly. Will it combine with the Soviet Union? Will a Soviet-Japanese combination cause further chaos in the Far East? We firmly believe that the Soviet Union will only solve the scattered outstanding issues with Japan and at most restore normal international relations. Because the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty limits the Soviet Union from concluding any international treaty that is detrimental to China's resistance to aggression. Recent announcements and speeches from the Soviet Union's October Revolution commemoration festival are especially credible. The Soviet Union likes to make surprising moves, and the treaty with Germany is one example. However, the purpose of the Soviet-German treaty was to deal with Britain, and the initial aim was not to divide the spoils. If Japan has the courage to fight the United States, as Germany did with England, then Soviet-Japanese relations can be improved, as Soviet-German relations have been. But can Japan fight the United States?

Japan has invaded China for over two years, and is exhausted. Its economy does not allow it to wage war with other countries. Its elite army has suffered more than half casualties, and its air force has little left. Its military does not allow it to wage war with other countries. The navy is still able to maintain its third-place international ranking, but today it can only rely on the navy to maintain its international position. Would it dare to bet everything on a single throw? The state of the country does not allow it to wage war with other countries. The raw materials for waging war against China depend entirely on overseas supplies, especially from the United States. Its materials fundamentally do not allow it to wage war, let alone against the United States! Even if the Soviet Union agrees to provide assistance, the possible amount of assistance is negligible and cannot maintain Japan's wartime consumption. It is generally known that it is absolutely impossible. Moreover, in terms of Japan itself, is it possible to combine with the Soviet Union to fight the U.S.? How will the authorities formulate words to report this to the Emperor and to inform the people? It is no different than demolishing the great defense of their national founding ideology. Is it possible?

Today, Japan's only hope is that the United States will only show its current attitude and not take concrete action. This kind of hope is also Japan's assessment and hope for the United States for several years. However, in our observation, U.S. policy is firm and stable, always having its predetermined steps, its just goals, its determination to implement, and the strength to put them into practice. To think that the unanimous roaring of Japanese newspapers today, or the bluffing of the Japanese authorities in the future, will make the United States apprehensive and change its policies, this is definitely not the case. Moreover, the so-called arms embargo is by no means an unprecedentedly serious measure in the United States. For the past two years, the United States has continued to export large quantities of military supplies and raw materials to Japan, providing the means for invasion and slaughter, and contributing to the destruction of international peace and order. This is actually a "legal crime" in the United States. Do American officials and the public have no moral concept, do they not know this? Therefore, by January of next year, the actual form of the so-called arms embargo by the United States will only be that after the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, U.S.-Japan trade will naturally return to "blank paper" only, there is nothing else. If it does not return to blank paper, then China and those who sympathize with China can appeal to the American officials and the public: Do not assist aggression again! Do not assist slaughter again! Moreover, it also proves by the roaring of Japan today that although the United States assists aggression and slaughter, it will inevitably bite back at the United States in the future.

### British Authorities Take Notice of American Envoy's Remarks in Japan; Plan to Archive Them in the Congressional Library; Japanese Newspapers Conduct Anti-American Propaganda

London – Undersecretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today that Foreign Secretary Halifax does not intend to publish the full text of Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent interview with a reporter from the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun regarding Anglo-Japanese relations as a white paper. However, the full text of the speech given by American Ambassador to Japan Grew in Tokyo on October 20th will be archived in the House of Commons Library. Labour MP Noel-Baker asked if the Undersecretary could guarantee that the Prime Minister's remarks to the Asahi Shimbun reporter were based on the fundamental principles of past foreign policy. Butler replied, "Yes, the British government's policy is unified and fundamental." (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Tokyo – Japanese newspapers today continued to criticize the United States' tough Far East policy. "Asahi Shimbun" warned that unless the United States lifts its oppression of Japan, "Japan will rise up and fight the United States." Japanese newspapers condemned the American plan to ban arms exports to Japan and the Vincent Naval Expansion Act, which requires US$1,750,000,000. Japanese newspapers described this as "an example of arrogant Americanism" and said that if the United States continues to oppress Japan, Japan will develop close relations with the Soviet Union. Today, Japanese newspapers also threatened the United States, saying that if the United States uses a "two-pronged" approach of banning arms exports to Japan and expanding its navy against Japan, Japan will refuse to "protect" American interests in China. No matter what pressure the United States applies, Japan will not change its determination to establish a "new order" in the Far East. The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun stated, "Japan is prepared to rise up and resist the United States to safeguard the survival of the Japanese nation." The remarks made by American Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman about imposing economic sanctions on Japan may be a form of intimidation before Japan and the United States hold negotiations. If the United States believes that Japan is eager to establish friendly relations with the United States, it would be better not to hold a meeting. According to the Jiji Shimbun, if the United States ignores the facts and talks loftily about legal principles, the problems between Japan and the United States will be difficult to resolve. Therefore, if the two countries do not want to resolve the outstanding issues, so be it. If they want to resolve the outstanding issues, mutual concessions are necessary. However, the only way to resolve the outstanding issues is to maintain mutual concessions without engaging in empty talk. (United Press dispatch, 9th)

### Soviet-Japanese Preparation for Negotiations on Outstanding Issues

Tokyo – The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will negotiate with Japanese Ambassador Togo in Moscow to resolve the disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura and Soviet Ambassador Smetanin will also meet in Tokyo soon. The Soviet Ambassador will visit Nomura within a few days to prepare for the expected meeting. The result of the talks between Molotov and Togo is that it has been agreed to establish a joint Japanese-Manchukuo-Soviet-Mongolian committee to demarcate the border of the recent war zone in Nomonhan. It is expected that the committee will meet in Chita soon. Given the attitude to be adopted by the participants, the negotiations are expected to proceed smoothly. At the same time, Colonel Livanov, the naval attaché of the Soviet Embassy, met with reporters when he departed for Vladivostok on Sunday for a vacation back home, saying that Soviet-Japanese friendship could definitely be enhanced, and said, "I am confident that Japanese-Soviet relations will gradually improve in the future. As far as China is concerned, there is unlikely to be anything that would cause concern about the relations between the two countries. Ambassador Smetanin will definitely inform the Japanese authorities of the Soviet Union's wishes frankly as soon as possible. I believe that bilateral negotiations will be held in Tokyo to adjust general relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, proceeding in parallel with the meetings in Moscow and Chita. I heard that Ambassador Smetanin will hold a meeting with the Soviet Ambassador to China soon, but I am not at liberty to disclose the location of the meeting." (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Tokyo – The Chugai Shogyo Shimpo published an editorial today stating that after viewing the speech given by Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov to the Supreme Soviet on October 31st, it is not difficult to guess the mission of the new Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Smetanin. In the past, whenever attempts were made to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations, various difficulties would arise. However, various outstanding issues between the Soviet Union and Japan, such as the border dispute between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia, fishery issues, and the issue of concessions for oil and coal on Sakhalin Island, can be resolved. It is now urgent to find an opportunity to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible, without regard to Japan's negotiations with Britain and the United States. The Yomiuri Shimbun also published an article on the same issue, stating that the relationship between the Soviet Union issue and the handling of the China Incident is far more important than the issue of adjusting American-Japanese relations. The Soviet Union has been seeking to open up opportunities for twenty years, and now this opportunity has arrived for the Soviet Union. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### Japanese Budget for the Next Fiscal Year

Tokyo – The Japan Times reported today that although non-urgent expenditures have been greatly reduced in Japan's budget for the next fiscal year, it will still exceed 10,500,000,000 Japanese yen. The total amount of ordinary budget expenditures is expected to be 5,000,000,000 yen, and military expenditures will be 5,500,000,000 yen. The budget for this year is 8,874,000,000 yen. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### Soviet Timber Transported to Britain

London – British Minister of Supply Burgin stated in the House of Commons today that efforts have been made to charter ships to transport Soviet timber to Britain. Six batches of timber under the Anglo-American goods exchange agreement have arrived in Britain, and the rubber and tin that Britain should pay have been delivered to the Soviet authorities in full.

### Japanese Socialist Party Petition for Food Rice Monopoly

Hong Kong – A Tokyo dispatch reports that the Japanese Social Masses Party has recently submitted a petition to Prime Minister Abe, requesting the government to imitate the precedents of tobacco and salt monopolies and implement a food rice monopoly. The main points include: (1) The government should implement a food rice monopoly so that the price of rice can be in an appropriate proportion to the prices of other major commodities. (2) The government should review the overall situation of the food problem and draft practical measures so that the distribution of food (including the implementation of a rationed food system) can proceed smoothly. (3) The provisions of the National General Mobilization Law should be fully implemented. (4) Increase rice production, etc. The seriousness of the food problem in Japan is evident from this.

### Hitler Returns to Berlin Early After Speech; Escapes Bombing Attempt; Sixty-Six Dead and Wounded, 500,000 Marks Reward for Apprehending the Culprit; Anniversary of the National Socialist Party Uprising Brings Disaster

Munich – Leader Hitler delivered a speech to veteran National Socialist Party members here last night. Shortly after he left the venue, a bombing occurred, killing six people and injuring about sixty who had not yet left the venue. The people of Munich are very angry about this act of violence and have offered a reward of 500,000 marks for the arrest of the culprit. Leader Hitler arrived in Munich yesterday to participate in the ceremony commemorating the National Socialist Party members who rose up in Munich in 1923. Due to important official business in Berlin that required Leader Hitler's personal attention, he left Munich early and departed by special train for Berlin last night. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 9th)

Munich – Yesterday, a bomb exploded in the cellar of the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich. The explosion was quite powerful, and half of the ceiling was destroyed. Fortunately, there were only about a hundred people in the hall at the time, and they were preparing to leave, so the damage was relatively small. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 9th)

Berlin – Six people died and twenty-nine were seriously injured in the Munich bombing, and several others were slightly injured. National Socialist Party dignitaries were unharmed. According to well-informed sources, foreign newspaper reports that Hitler's representative Hess was also injured are completely inaccurate. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 9th)

Munich – It has been confirmed that eight people died in the Munich bombing. Their names are as follows: (1) Rödl, a member of Hitler's stormtroopers in Munich; (2) Kaiser, a merchant near Munich; (3) Weber, a radio reporter; (4) Reindl, a clerk; (5) Kasper-Gartner, a member of the Munich military band; (6) Schächter, a radio station employee; (7) two unnamed men. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 8th)

Berlin – The Munich bombing is under investigation. Political figures in Berlin believe that all the current evidence indicates that the mastermind is related to foreign countries. Key figures in the British and French governments have publicly stated that this war is not against Germany, but against the National Socialist system, and Hitler is the target of all attacks. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 9th)

Berlin – Hitler arrived at Anhalter Bahnhof this morning by special train from Munich. Police officers guarded the east entrance of the station to prevent assassination attempts. Key figures such as General Göring left the station with him. Hitler took a specially prepared car to the Chancellery. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 9th)

### Hitler Denounces Britain, Prepares for Five-Year War, States Germany Will Not Surrender

Berlin – Leader Hitler delivered a speech to veteran National Socialist Party members and the families of the fallen martyrs in Munich, where the National Socialist Party uprising took place last night, declaring that this day in 1923 was a critical moment for the German nation because it was the first time after the Treaty of Versailles that the German nation was awakened and began a revival movement, the result of which was the birth of Greater Germany. Hitler then recounted the reasons for the failure in 1919, generally stating that preparations were not sufficient at the beginning of the war in 1914. As for today, he himself and the German nation are convinced that Britain and France cannot defeat Germany. The reason why Germany failed in World War I was that the government at the time was weak and could not resist those in Britain who incited the war, such as Churchill. At this point, Hitler spoke at length about Britain's wartime slogans, saying that Britain always concocts excuses for every war. One says it fights for small countries, and another says it fights for justice. Indeed, as a result of Britain fighting for small countries and for justice for three hundred years, it has acquired 40 million square kilometers of foreign land and 480 million people of other races. Is this what Britain calls justice? Furthermore, it says that Britain is fighting for culture. If that is the case, then Britain should pay attention to the culture of the poor areas in its mining areas and large cities, which is more urgent than engaging in war. It also says that Britain is not fighting against the German people, but against the German government, and that its purpose is to liberate the German people from the oppression of the militarist government. Although its words are clever, the facts are obvious. In fact, Britain's policy for three hundred years can be summarized in one sentence: to subjugate all countries. Even the League of Nations is just a tool used to maintain the status quo. British cabinet members shout that the German government has no credibility. In fact, Britain has repeatedly promised Germany equal rights and the return of its colonies, making solemn vows, but failing to fulfill its promises. Britain's goal is to plunge Germany into poverty and distress. Little does it know that it is precisely because of the oppression of this evil force that Germany has been reborn again. Hitler then said that he had ordered General Göring to prepare a five-year war plan, not because he thought the war would last for five years, but to show that Germany was determined not to surrender. Hitler then solemnly declared that his last speech in the Reichstag was the final declaration to the international situation, and that in the future, he would only deal with it in a language that Britain could understand.

The British Aircraft Carrier Courageous, Sunk by a German Submarine

### Why are Germans Smuggling Dutch Uniforms?

The Hague, Netherlands – The Netherlands is currently closely monitoring the "Uniform" espionage case. A few days ago, the authorities discovered that Dutch people were attempting to smuggle various types of Dutch uniforms into Germany. A large-scale search was launched, and four Germans were arrested in Hengelo, near the border. It turned out that someone speaking German in Deventer wanted to buy Dutch military hats. The hat maker became suspicious and recorded the person's car number, reporting it to the authorities. As a result, the police were able to capture the four Germans in the car in Hengelo. According to yesterday's report, authorities discovered a German plane in a garage while searching a residence. According to investigations, a group of people are trying to smuggle various uniforms worn by Dutch tram conductors to cavalry officers into Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### Churchill Declares that Britain Has Controlled the German Submarine Offensive; Gains Outweigh Losses in the Past Two Months; The Danger Still Exists but Preparations Have Been Made

London – First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill stated in the House of Commons today, "I can now say more definitively what I told the House of Commons six weeks ago, namely that we are gradually gaining the upper hand in the attack on submarines. Germany has boasted to the world about the loss of British ships. I can answer that we are willing to use only the warships that Germany claims to have destroyed to deal with the entire German Navy. German radio has repeatedly said that the British ship Ark Royal has been sunk. In fact, one of the most valuable spoils of war recently captured from the Germans is this Ark Royal. In the second month after the outbreak of the war, the British ships sunk by the Germans totaled 72,000 tons, less than half of what was lost in the first month. During this period, we captured 52,000 tons of enemy ships, purchased 27,000 tons from foreign countries, and built 57,000 tons of new ships. After offsetting the losses, there was a net gain of 64,000 tons. Statistically, in the eight weeks after the outbreak of the war, the net loss of our ships was less than three percent. During these eight weeks, over 10 million tons of goods were imported into Britain, with less than 250,000 tons lost. However, over 400,000 tons of goods destined for Germany were captured. The initial implementation of the British convoy system inevitably caused some delays in shipping traffic, but the delays can be greatly reduced after the full implementation of the convoy system. We have withdrawn hundreds of the largest merchant ships in these two months to install self-defense armaments. This matter is still in progress, which is also one of the reasons for the delays in shipping. It is extremely difficult to determine how many German submarines have been lost because many submarines sink into the deep sea without leaving a trace. However, according to a conservative estimate, the loss of German submarines should be two to three per week. We may assume that Germany can build two new submarines each week, which would amount to twenty submarines in ten weeks. According to this calculation, Germany will have a total of one hundred submarines by January next year, excluding the number that have been sunk during this time. Therefore, we still have a great struggle ahead of us. For this reason, our preparations are now actively underway on the largest scale. The number of ships searching for German submarines is now three times more than at the beginning of the war. From next spring, a large number of new ships specially suitable for searching for submarines will be built one after another. Therefore, in terms of material aspects alone, we can be optimistic about the future. Although we may suffer extremely hateful attacks, we have now made preparations for prevention. I want to warn the House of Commons that continued losses are expected and that it cannot be guaranteed that losses will be avoided at any time. In addition to submarines, we also have to deal with enemy ships on the surface. Germany has one or two pocket battleships that have indeed been sailing in the Atlantic Ocean for the past six months. However, although these German ships have been lurking on the shipping lanes used by Atlantic convoys, they have not dared to carry out large-scale captures of merchant ships. To date, only two ships have been sunk by them, totaling 10,000 tons, far less than the 202,000 tons sunk by submarines. The crisis still exists today, so I am issuing this warning. However, it is comforting that the submarine war has been controlled, and the attacks by surface warships and armed merchant ships have not yet developed to a serious degree. The French Navy is now also powerful, unlike before, not only assisting the British Navy in accordance with the various methods agreed upon before the war, but also sharing the work undertaken by the British Navy. France is making great efforts on land and providing powerful assistance to the Allied countries at sea, which is truly amazing. Now, in the ninth week of the war, we have very good hopes for the sea." Churchill also reported on the loss of the British submarine Oxley, saying that the submarine was lost due to an accidental internal explosion. The cause of the explosion has not yet been announced. What can be announced is that four officers and forty-two soldiers died. As for the losses caused by the Germans, they are announced at any time. The House of Commons should know that the large-scale war currently underway is seen only at sea in fact, and the losses are not limited to those at sea. For example, the loss of the battleship Oak has now been found to be caused by a German submarine invading the defenses of the anchorage in Scapa Flow and firing a torpedo. The authorities have now made plans to strengthen the defenses of Scapa Flow. The crew of the ship were very confident in the defenses of Scapa Flow and never expected anything to happen. When the ship was hit by the first torpedo, experienced crew members did not suspect a torpedo but suspected an aerial attack. Even the captain suspected an internal explosion inside the hull. In an instant, the enemy ship's second batch of torpedoes was fired. The Navy Department, which bears great responsibility, has decided after this lesson that in this new type of war with all kinds of novel weapons, one must never be confident in safety. The First Lord of the Admiralty also said that since the outbreak of the war, the loss of British naval lives has been greater than the total losses of Britain and France in all other aspects.

### Turkey Implements Demobilization

Ankara, Turkey – According to a newspaper report, the government has decided to demobilize all levels of reservists who were called up after the outbreak of the European war. It is believed that Turkey is now in a favorable situation, so demobilization is possible. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Ankara, Turkey – Foreign Minister Saracoğlu stated when the parliament approved the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Mutual Assistance Treaty that this agreement could become a very important turning point in world history. The efforts of Britain, France, and Turkey for peace will become more effective and produce greater results in the future. This treaty has opened up happy new memories for Turkey in the political, social, and economic spheres. At a time when the world is encountering misfortune, it is appropriate for Turkey to join the strong group led by the strongest countries. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### New York Foreign Exchange Market

New York – In today's New York foreign exchange market, the British pound continued to weaken under constant pressure, while the Belgian franc reached a new low in the past six years.

The Dutch guilder closed at 53.08, down 0.01 from yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### Nordic Heads of State Respond to Belgian-Dutch Peace Appeal; West Reads Chamberlain's Speech Reaffirming Determination to Fight to the End

The Hague – Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, together with King Leopold III of Belgium, sent a telegram to the three nations of England, France, and Germany to mediate a truce. Subsequently, the Kings of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and the President of Finland, have all telegraphed their approval (Havas, 8th).

Beijing – Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, after accompanying King Leopold of Belgium to The Hague for a meeting with the Queen of the Netherlands, has already returned here and subsequently received the envoys of the Netherlands, Denmark, and Poland. The content of the discussion has not been disclosed (Reuters, 9th).

London – Regarding the mediation of a truce by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, the British and French governments exchanged opinions all day today. Foreign Secretary Halifax met twice with the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, for talks. According to political figures, the replies from Britain and France will likely reiterate the war aims and conditions for peace, as repeatedly declared by Prime Minister Chamberlain. At this time, the consultation is not about the content of the reply, but rather deliberating on the manner of response (Havas, 8th).

London – The Ministry of Information has recently issued a message stating, "The broadcast speech delivered by Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday was actually regarded by the German Foreign Ministry as an answer to the mediation of a truce by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands. In fact, the Foreign Secretary was completely unaware of this matter when drafting the speech, and the mediation proposal should be carefully considered by King George VI. This has already been announced by Prime Minister Chamberlain to the House of Commons" (Havas, 8th).

London – Today at noon, a banquet was held at the residence of the Lord Mayor of London. Prime Minister Chamberlain was unable to attend due to illness, so he delegated Finance Minister Simon to read the speech. The speech first mentioned the peace proposals of the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, saying that the two heads of state made a great offer with noble intentions, which is deeply appreciated. However, given past experiences, Hitler may not respond satisfactorily. Before the British government makes a reply, it must consult with the dominions and allied countries fighting alongside it. This war is determined to be the most peculiar in history. Although the war has been going on for some time, it must be made to seem as if there is no war at all, but only a form of siege. The government cannot predict how long this war will last, or when it will suddenly turn into a fierce battle. However, in recent weeks, the position of the allied forces has not deteriorated as a result, and has even been strengthened. The alliance of Britain, France, and Turkey can be a powerful tool for peace in Southeastern Europe. The Soviet-German pact only benefits the Soviet Union unilaterally, while Germany only suffers humiliation and loss. The United States' removal of the arms embargo, reopening the gateway for allied countries to rely on the world's largest arsenal, is a crucial move. The strength of the British navy, army, and air force has proven that they can be trusted to cope with any task entrusted to them in the future. The British government knows that the relocation of hundreds of thousands of children to the countryside involves various dangers and pains, but the experience gained in the last great war shows that we should start early to avoid hasty mistakes. The issue of domestic defense lines is not very different from what was required in the last great war, but there are important new factors involved. We should apply relentless economic pressure on the "enemy," and we should obtain the essential goods needed by Britain, just as in the beginning of the last great war. The number of armed forces mobilized now is already huge, and even if it does not exceed the number in the last great war, it will be comparable to it. Because the various armies must be mechanized, the equipment work is much more expensive and complex than before. All additional expenses have created new problems in terms of foreign exchange. It is not surprising that the manufacturing and supply should be greatly controlled, including some restrictions on exports. This is because only in this way can the goods that Britain must need be used sparingly, and prevent the goods needed by Germany from being transferred to them. When the Great War broke out in 1914, the national finances gradually transitioned from a state of peace to a state of war. The payment of cash by banks was suspended for financial reasons, but this was enough due to careful preparation for a one-day bank holiday. The implementation of foreign exchange control has become an innovative measure. Although it has not yet started in full, it has quickly achieved results with the assistance of banks and other financial institutions. In other countries, it takes years to reach this point. We should not neglect our shipping and exchange resources, because although they are vast, they are not without limits. We do not know how long the war will last. We must prepare to fight until we achieve final victory. For the input of military deployments, we must compete for shipping space and foreign exchange, while at the same time taking care of the needs of the civilians. Now, we hope that when people cannot buy luxury imports, cannot obtain sufficient gasoline to drive their cars, and even have to give up the food they are accustomed to seeing on their breakfast tables, they should not forget that all of this is to help the country obtain more ships and foreign exchange for our war effort. In the first few weeks of the war, one of the most remarkable things is the unity of the people of the whole country. In our determination to complete the scheduled responsibilities, we have obtained the support of all classes, parties, and races in the country. We can truly claim to have a broader unity, that is, the unity of the empire. We can see in the dominions, India, and the great colonial empire the same belief in our principles and the same result of making them victorious. We have the most complete and sincere understanding with France. With this spirit and with such allies, we are determined not to be reduced to failure. Therefore, we firmly believe that we will see the foundation of a new world laid, where freedom and humanism will replace oppression and the rule of force (Reuters, 9th).

London – The Times commented that our minimum conditions have recently been stated by the Prime Minister, who said, "Our goal is well known, namely, to liberate Europe from the continuous fear of German aggression, and to enable the people of Europe to maintain their independence and freedom." This declaration, of course, should not be changed in any situation, and it must be added that we have guaranteed that we will not consider any peace treaty without the participation of the Polish government. Some suspect that the joint peace movement by the monarchs of the Netherlands and Belgium at this time is related to the rumors that the neutrality of the Netherlands and Belgium is currently threatened. This statement, however, does not reflect the pure and selfless nature of the Dutch and Belgian monarchs' desire for peace. Indeed, German propaganda has accused the Netherlands and Belgium of non-neutral actions, criticizing them on one hand for allowing freedom of speech, resulting in newspapers daring to attack German policies, and on the other hand for acquiescing to England's exercise of its blockade rights permitted by international law. Considering the fate of other small countries on the German border, how can the Netherlands and Belgium not be suspicious of what these accusations portend? (Reuters, 9th).

Washington – Secretary of State Hull stated today that the governments of the Netherlands and Belgium have not directly notified the United States of their joint peace appeal, nor have they asked the United States to participate in any efforts to end the war (Reuters, 8th).

### Aerial Battle Over the North Sea; German Planes Distribute Molotov's Speech

London – The Ministry of Aviation has recently issued a message stating that two of our reconnaissance planes engaged in combat with three German planes over the North Sea. One German plane was shot down into the sea. The pilot of the second plane seemed to have lost control and crashed. It is difficult to confirm whether we shot it down. The third plane escaped after running out of ammunition. In addition, several of our planes flew to northwestern Germany yesterday for reconnaissance and took many important photos. Afterwards, all but one plane safely returned to base (Havas, 8th).

Luxembourg – A British plane landed in Esch, southern Luxembourg, this morning. According to the pilot, he pursued and shot down two German planes, flying to a height of 23,000 feet, and believed he was over French territory, so he landed. The pilot has been detained and the plane has been confiscated (Reuters, 8th).

Paris – Germany sent many planes today to the skies over the allied lines and the interior of France for reconnaissance. It is reported that German planes carried out three air raids on the land. Recent French war reports state that there is unusual activity on the front lines (Reuters, 8th).

Paris – Today, Le Petit Parisien reported a dispatch from Maurice stating that a Nazi plane scattered leaflets printed with a speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov over the Allied lines and the outskirts of Paris as propaganda. The plane had been disguised, and all the leaflets were printed to resemble communist propaganda. Maurice also stated that in the past 24 hours, British and French planes had jointly conducted reconnaissance flights over German territory (Reuters, 9th).

### French Finance Minister Explains; War Aims; Not Material Interests; But to Fulfill Ideals

Paris – Finance Minister Reynaud delivered a speech at a luncheon at the American Club today, explaining the war aims and conditions for peace, stating that not far from our country, there is now a nation that only knows how to worship force and regard it as the only moral concept. Various illegal acts abound. The assassination of former Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, the successive occupation of Czechoslovakia and Poland, are all acts of violence by that country. To this day, Nazi Germany is even proclaiming, "Give me time to digest what I have plundered. After digestion, my strength will become even greater, and I will continue to act." If we give Germany a chance to breathe, we will be attacked by that country again in six months. You may tell me that some people do not know this crisis, but you cannot say that this crisis does not exist. It must be understood that if Germany wins, civilized Europe will come to an end. The French nation has automatically accepted all kinds of sacrifices for the sake of defending freedom. We firmly believe that this spirit will surely overcome the enemy. Finance Minister Reynaud concluded by saying, "The aim of the British and French allies in going to war is not to seek material interests, but to fulfill their ideals. To all who can hear my speech, whether friend or foe, I must declare to them that we have no choice but to go to war, and we must go all out, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal. If the enemy wants to engage in total war, we want to lay the foundation for total peace." After Finance Minister Reynaud finished speaking, the audience responded with warm applause (Havas, 9th).

### Dutch Military Authorities Decide; To Expand Flooded Areas; To Prevent Foreign Invasion from the East

London – According to reports from Amsterdam, Dutch military authorities have decided to expand the flooded areas and flood a certain key area of the Dutch Water Line to prevent foreign invasion from the east. According to observers, if the German army advances rapidly into the Netherlands to occupy positions for attacking England, the flooding may cause difficulties, but it is not an insurmountable obstacle. People here generally believe that the joint peace movement launched by the monarchs of Belgium and the Netherlands is due to the threat of German invasion of the Netherlands (Reuters, 9th).

### A Secret History Amidst the European War

London – The court today opened the trial of Princess Hohenlohe's lawsuit against Lord Rothermere, owner of the Daily Mail, for breach of contract and seeking compensation. The plaintiff's lawyer, Beth, stated that the purpose of the lawsuit was to restore the princess's reputation and expose the false defamatory news published in French, German, and Austrian newspapers. The princess first met Lord Rothermere in social circles thirteen years ago. One day, she suggested to the Lord that he should start a campaign to inform the British public of the suffering Hungary had endured. The Lord approved. In July 1927, the Daily Mail published an article entitled "The Position of Hungary." After the publication of this article, Hungary welcomed it, calling the Lord "the Father of Hungary." In Budapest and other cities, many major roads or parks were named "Rothermere." In 1932, the Lord proposed that the princess should serve as his personal foreign political representative because she had decided to work to restore the Hohenzollern and Habsburg dynasties. The Lord then gave the princess £5,000 in British gold and expenses. Once the princess accepted this position, she became the Lord's diplomatic representative, and then corresponded with the German ex-Emperor, the ex-Crown Prince, Hitler, and the Hungarian Regent and Prime Minister. The princess had personally seen Hitler and advised the Lord not to contact him again, but when negotiating with the German ex-Crown Prince, the Lord declared to the ex-Crown Prince when he arrived in Germany that he was willing to do his best to help the German Hohenzollern imperial family restore their throne. Some time later, foreign newspapers repeatedly published news that the princess was working as a spy for the Lord. The Lord advised her to ignore it. After Hitler took office as Deputy Chancellor of Germany, the princess received a letter from the Crown Prince, stating his opinions on the political situation. In 1933, the princess, on the orders of the Lord, went to see Hitler. The following year, she received a letter from Hitler inviting the Lord to visit Berlin. During this five and a half year period, the Lord paid the princess a total of £46,000. Until the end of 1936, the princess, carrying Hitler's invitation, accompanied the Lord to Hitler's villa in Berchtesgaden to meet with Hitler. At the time of the coronation of the King of England, the princess introduced Lord to Hitler's aide, Weidemann. In January 1938, Lord sent the princess to Berlin to meet with Hitler regarding a certain Hungarian event and to discuss the issue of returning German colonies. The princess acted in accordance with this instruction, but a few months later, the Lord suddenly broke off all contact with her, without a single word, so she had no choice but to file a lawsuit. The princess then also spoke to prove the points made by the lawyer. The court scheduled to continue the trial tomorrow (Reuters, 8th).

### Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Continue

The Finnish capital – Finance Minister Tanner is currently in Moscow, conducting negotiations with Soviet authorities. He made a statement to special correspondents from domestic newspapers this morning, stating, "Negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union have been temporarily suspended due to the 22nd anniversary of the Russian Revolution. This delegation will now request the Soviet authorities to reopen talks today" (Havas, 9th).

### New American Aircraft; Unwilling to Sell

Washington – According to Secretary of War Woodring today, the United States' newest aircraft will not be sold to foreign countries unless we have discovered or manufactured even newer models. According to this, although the United States' Neutrality Act has become law, the American aircraft that Britain and France can obtain are certainly not the newest models (United Press, 9th).

### German Conspiracy in South Africa Exposed

London – Official sources have issued a broadcast stating that German Nazi Party members conspired to cause unrest in the Union of South Africa in the early days of the war. Fortunately, the federal government discovered it in time and curbed it, and has obtained sufficient evidence to confirm that Nazi Party members wanted to organize a Blackshirt team in the South African state to create chaos and engage in sabotage. The official list of all Nazi Party members in various rebel groups will be published soon (Havas, 9th).

### Why Do Men Want to Love, Love, and Dislike Their Wives?

Which cat doesn't eat meat? Which physiologically mature man doesn't want a wife? Who doesn't love a wife? However, many men often dislike their wives. What is the reason for this? A mature man with healthy sexual function, if unmarried or separated from his wife, will, like the ancestors of ancient times, pay attention to the tender forests, always passionately harboring fantasies of beautiful encounters. At this time, if a good match is made by fate, marrying a healthy and beautiful woman, or if two hearts are connected and reunited with a beloved wife, how can they not be as close as glue? Deep love, in a joyous and harmonious life, gives birth to clever children, organizes a happy family, and creates a bright future. How wonderful is life! But one point of energy, one point of career, and love are allowed! If a man has committed masturbation, nocturnal emission, early marriage and indulgence, or multiple wives, causing the sexual health of the glands that control sexual function to be exhausted, then various symptoms such as neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, premature aging, kidney deficiency, and lack of offspring will be more than enough. Even if this kind of sick husband has a beautiful wife, he will inevitably be unable to be fulfilled in the life of love, or even completely unable to perform his marital duties. In this case, the man has already become bored of love! However, the wife's youth is wasted, can she not feel sad and sorrowful! In this era, there are countless women who openly form new relationships and divorce their husbands with righteous arguments! A dignified and upright man, suffering this great humiliation, what is the grief in his heart like! Therefore, a smart man must be good at maintaining his sexual health. The way to maintain it, it is indeed important to have a clear heart and few desires, and timely supplementation is also necessary. However, supplementation is not about quantity but about quality, and it is important to seek the right treatment. As for the above-mentioned symptoms, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the sex gland hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" is the most effective treatment. This agent is made from the essence of the sex glands extracted from strong animals such as apes, monkeys, and sea dogs, and produced by scientific replication, and the active ingredients are completely preserved. Therefore, the quality is precious and the effect is reliable, surpassing any similar preparations. After taking it, it can generate essence and nourish the kidneys, invigorate the brain and blood, and it is valuable to take it continuously, which will further promote development, nourish nerves, and replenish energy. All symptoms can be cured in a short period of time. Regular use in autumn and winter will prolong life and rejuvenate. Only those with spermatorrhea must also take the holy medicine for treating spermatorrhea "Ximituo's Gujing Pills" (available in major Chinese and Western pharmacies at a fixed price of two yuan per box) to stop the leakage and achieve rapid results.

### Treatment of Nocturnal Emission in Early Winter Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianhui

Not storing essence in winter will inevitably lead to illness in spring. This is common knowledge that everyone knows. Therefore, for patients with spermatorrhea, winter is a very important juncture. It is considered the best time for treatment in early winter when the weather is not yet severely cold. Because curing spermatorrhea at this time and cultivating it for three winters will naturally result in sufficient essence and strength. The appearance of health and a rosy complexion in the coming spring is a natural result. If those with spermatorrhea neglect this opportunity and allow it to persist without treatment, or if ignorant young people continue to commit masturbation and indulgence, then the sexual nerves will inevitably become weaker day by day, and the seminal vesicle will become more and more relaxed. Some people will change from mild nocturnal emission to dangerous spermatorrhea. More people than can be counted will suffer from exhausted semen, causing brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, etc. These young people will inevitably have a sallow complexion, be thin and weak, and have a listless spirit. In early winter, they will already have cold hands and feet. Those who are students will inevitably fall behind in their studies. Those who are engaged in industry and commerce will also have difficulty being competent. When they want to fall in love, because of their unattractive appearance, they are often abandoned by women and fall into heartbreak! Even if they get married through the words of a matchmaker, it is even more difficult to have a fulfilling sexual life between husband and wife, or even completely unable to perform their marital duties. Under the wife's passionate desire, how can she not feel heartbroken and remorseful? As a result, diseases are caused, pessimism ensues, or even divorce and adultery occur, as often seen in today's social news! Young people who become weak and lose their health due to spermatorrhea become sinners in love and sinners in society, which is truly pitiful! At the same time, it is also a great humiliation for men! If you want to seek remedy, you can only cure the spermatorrhea at this time. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Ximi Late's Gujing Pills" is the most effective treatment. This medicine consolidates the seminal vesicle, calms the nerves, and has the special effects of promoting sleep and stopping spermatorrhea the night after taking it. However, those who already have the above-mentioned symptoms must also take the sex gland hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and continue to take it, which will surely cure all symptoms in a short period of time and make the body healthier. Patients who can personally come to this clinic to apply electrotherapy injections and other methods can be guaranteed to be cured.

### Beauty How to Make the Breasts Plump and High?

— Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine

A pair of high breasts, set against a graceful figure, plump hips, and a fair and rosy face, along with willow eyebrows, cherry lips, pearly teeth, and a delicate nose, such a healthy and beautiful woman is not only respected as a goddess by her husband in the family. Between the two sexes, affection is especially strong. Even when she goes out to socialize, with her good looks, she is welcomed everywhere like a "star surrounded by the moon."

However, such healthy and beautiful women are still a minority in society. The only main reason is that women rely entirely on the full and sound function of the ovaries to achieve the above-mentioned health and beauty. If the ovarian function is sound, then the characteristics of women, that is, there is good development, the most obvious. It is that the breasts are firm and elastic, and even if they wear tight clothes, they refuse to conform and protrude so much in front of the chest, with the two peaks facing each other and a deep valley, how captivating this is. At the same time, the hips must also be quite developed, plus a lively willow waist, which forms the most mysterious and lovely full curves of women. However, only well-developed women can enjoy these. Others who have indulged in masturbation in their early years, or who have irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge, weakness after illness, resulting in unsound ovarian function and affecting metabolism, even the originally high breasts will gradually wither away, beauty will be lost, and the complexion will become haggard. Such women are not only disliked by men and have no happiness, but also in terms of their personal temperament, they are often narrow-minded, stubborn, melancholy, and sentimental. The god of happiness has no connection with her. Therefore, the tragic fate of her future is also unimaginable! If you want to seek remedy, you can only rely on science. According to the experience of world-renowned gynecologists Constan and others, it is generally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation for women "Shengzhi Su" is the most effective treatment. Therefore, this medicine can nourish ovarian function and promote metabolism after taking it. If you continue to take it, it is guaranteed to completely cure the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time, making the breasts plump and high, and transforming ugliness into beauty.

### Japanese Troops in Xiamen Seize the Power of the Quarantine Station in Gulangyu, Which Has Already Been Seized by the Japanese

Fuzhou Correspondence: After the Japanese occupied Xiamen Island in May of last year, they immediately spied to seize power in Gulangyu. On one hand, they encouraged the Gulangyu Municipal Council police to request a salary increase. On the other hand, in the name of the Japanese consul, they demanded that the Municipal Council appoint a Japanese as Deputy Chief Inspector and hire ten Japanese and Taiwanese as detectives to specifically arrest anti-Japanese elements. At the same time, they increased the resident tax rate by one-tenth to pay for their salaries. The Board of Directors of the Municipal Council refused the request. The Japanese then arrested seventeen people, including Pastor Wu Zhuokui of the tea trade, on Gulangyu Street and in refugee camps, accusing them of being anti-Japanese elements and executing them. The Municipal Council had no choice but to agree to the Japanese request. The Japanese then sent Daicang Zhike as Deputy Chief Inspector, bringing with him more than ten Japanese and Taiwanese detectives to Gulangyu to handle inspections and arrests. They also attacked the Mixed Court and the Municipal Council in Xiamen newspapers in an attempt to seize power. After the assassination of Hong Lixun, the president of the puppet Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, on Gulangyu, the Japanese immediately sent marines to land, guarding all intersections, conducting inspections, and cutting off transportation at the docks. Subsequently, Britain, France, and the United States also dispatched warships to Xiamen and sent marines to land to maintain order. The Japanese then put forward conditions, demanding that the consular corps allow the puppet Xiamen Maintenance Committee to fill the vacancies of the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council. The consular corps insisted on refusing. Knowing that it was difficult to achieve their goal, the Japanese withdrew their marines, and negotiations in Xiamen came to a standstill. When the Tianjin issue was being negotiated in Tokyo, the Japanese again advocated in Xiamen newspapers that the Gulangyu issue should also be included in the negotiations. The consular corps still ignored them, and the matter was dropped. When the Danzig issue arose, the Japanese believed that the time had come and again advocated in newspapers the occupation of the Mixed Court and the reorganization of the Municipal Council. After the outbreak of the European war, the Japanese believed that Britain and France's policies towards the Far East had become weak. They immediately forced the reorganization of the Municipal Council's Board of Directors and demanded that the consular corps change the administrative power of Gulangyu. The consular corps convened a meeting to discuss this. The Japanese consul put forward the following conditions: (1) The vacancies of the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council should be filled by personnel appointed by the puppet Xiamen Municipal Government. (2) The internal organization of the Municipal Council is not suitable for the current situation and must be reorganized. (3) The Municipal Council should employ Japanese staff as much as possible. (4) The agencies of the National Government on Gulangyu should be abolished. (5) Anti-Japanese elements lurking in Gulangyu should be cleared by the Japanese side. Due to the circumstances, the consular corps and the Board of Directors had no choice but to agree. The Japanese then took over the Gulangyu Chamber of Commerce and the seaport quarantine station in Xiamen a few days ago as a test of the implementation of various conditions. Currently, there is no resistance from any side, and soon the Japanese will definitely take the next step.

### Sun's Troops in Nantong Pay Attention to Military-Civilian Cooperation and Send Chen to Give Lectures to the Public

Nantong Correspondence: Commander Sun of the Security Brigade believes that the people of Tong, Ru, and Hai counties have not thoroughly understood the meaning of the war of resistance, resulting in a lack of close cooperation between the military and the civilians, which has a significant impact on the future of the war of resistance. Therefore, he specially appointed Secretary Wang Zhiping as a political guidance specialist to go to various counties to convene the people to lecture on the significance of the war of resistance, the responsibilities that the people should bear, and to painfully recount the failures of the Japanese invasion of China. He also advocated strengthening the general mobilization of the people, and distributed various propaganda books and newspapers and organized drama propaganda teams to enlighten the people with new knowledge.

### The Puppet County Government of Kunshan Regularly Forcibly Collects Land Taxes, Causing Great Suffering to Farmers

Kunshan Correspondence: Since the puppet county government of Kunshan began collecting land taxes last year, the amount collected has been very small. However, land tax revenue is the economic lifeline of the entire county. As the new grain is being harvested, the puppet county government is again working on formulating measures and streamlining collection procedures. In addition to establishing a combined tax collection office in the puppet county government, branch offices have been established in various townships such as Zhangpu, Jiaozhi, Chenmu, Xidun, Zhoushu, Bacheng, Zhengyi, Pengjian, Chajiabang, and Xiajiaqiao. It is scheduled to send a large number of personnel to the townships on the 10th to collect taxes. It has been found that although this year's autumn harvest in the county is still abundant, the instability in various rural areas has prevented farmers from plowing and cultivating in a timely manner during the farming season, resulting in a harvest this year that is inferior to the past. Now that the puppet county government is collecting land taxes again, the general farmers will suffer unspeakable hardships.

### The Youth Played by the Relief in Lingdong - Chaoshan Students Are Distributed to Meixian and Other Places to Study - Overseas Chinese Donate Scholarships and Teachers Take Classes During the Summer Vacation

(Shantou Correspondence) At the beginning of the fall of Chaoshan, all primary and secondary schools, cultural organizations, and institutions in various places were completely shut down. Unwilling to be oppressed by the Japanese army, the out-of-school youth scattered to the counties in the upper reaches of the Han River and the Dong River, wandering around with no way out. Some joined the war of resistance camp and were temporarily taken in by the military, political, and party agencies. The county administration training institute and the Baojia chief training institute, etc., opened by the Guangdong Provincial Government in Shao, can only accommodate the smallest number of young people. It has been found that the Chaoshan area has a population of more than five million, and there are four to five hundred thousand promising young people who need to be guided and utilized.

He Chunfan, the administrative commissioner of the Fifth District, went to Shaoguan in early October to report on his work and returned to Jieyang on the 18th. It is reported that he has obtained the approval of the provincial government to add five temporary middle schools in the mountains of Fengshun, Puning, and Jieyang, which will be presided over by military, political, and party agencies. Five hundred young people will be selected from among the middle school students to serve as cadres, who will be given six months of short-term training and then sent to various counties to be responsible for propaganda and organizing the masses. The living expenses of all staff members will be increased and improved as much as possible, with each person receiving 30 yuan of activity expenses per month to promote the efficiency of various tasks. There were originally 40 middle schools of various levels in Chaoshan. The establishment of temporary middle schools now is indeed a necessary move for the present. A large number of young students from Chaoshan have fled alone to Meixian, Xingning, and Pingyuan counties because they are unwilling to be obedient people and are willing to live their wandering and miserable lives. Wu Junshu and other eight male and female students from Shantou Municipal First Middle School fled to Mei and requested relief from Xiong Dansun, the secretary of the county party headquarters. The relief committee allocated funds, giving each person four yuan first, and then introducing male students Wu Shujun, Wu Binquan, Qiu Yusong, Chen Haofeng, and Huang Shaofeng to Meizhou Middle School to study for free. Female students Wang Ruozhen, Wu Shuzheng, and Chen Fengxian went to the Women's Normal School to study, and the relief committee first paid 32 yuan for the students' food expenses. Ji Xinrong and other four elementary school students from Chenghai who arrived later were sent to Pingyuan County Temporary Middle School to study. It has been found that all village schools in the Mei area will not have holidays this summer because there are so many new students who have moved in to study. During the summer vacation, all teachers and staff are doing their duty. Some enthusiastic overseas Chinese (such as Mr. Li Wenfang of Xinan Creek, Songkou) are willing to donate 100 or more scholarships. For schools with excellent performance, enthusiastic overseas Chinese are willing to donate tuition fees to allow general out-of-school students to enter schools for free. In addition to focusing on teaching and cultivating young people, many teachers from various schools have also joined the army, such as Lin Lingfeng of Pengfei School in Xiyang, Meixian, Li Rongmao of Wanshan School, and other teachers from other schools, such as Li Dongbi, Zhong Yingming, Qiu Tiangui, Tang Rensheng, and others, more than a hundred people, are willing to give up their chalk career and go to apply for cadre positions in the security office. Therefore, the recovery of the lost land of Chaoshan and the revitalization of the Republic of China is just around the corner (October 21st) (Xi)

### Shanghai - A Glimpse of Talent Supply and Demand Two Years After the War (1)

— Pan Wenan, Zheng Wenhan, Shen Guanglie

In the year after the August 13th Incident, a report was prepared based on the statistical materials of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center for that year (from July 26th to the end of June 27th), which roughly showed the supply and demand of talents in Shanghai after the war. Compared with before the war, it was even more serious, and the need for adjustments in all aspects of society was even more urgent. Before we knew it, two years had passed since the war. What changes have taken place in the supply and demand of talents? Are there any improvements compared with the actual situation before the war and in the first year after the war? It seems necessary to conduct another review. The statistical materials are still based on those of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center (from July 27th to the end of June 28th). Although it cannot represent the entire situation in Shanghai, because this organization is public and does not charge fees, and it has considerable contact with all aspects, the results obtained can also represent the general supply and demand of talents in Shanghai.

The Supply of Talent

By finding out what kind of people are seeking employment, we can get a general idea of the current situation of the unemployed. According to the statistics of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, there were a total of 2,346 people who registered for jobs last year, which is higher than the number before the war and in the first year after the war, with an average increase of 14 percent. It is conceivable that the number of unemployed people has increased due to the continuation of the war. Of the 2,346 job seekers, if we analyze them by gender, 1,926 are men, accounting for 82.1% of the total number, and 420 are women, accounting for 17.9%. Compared with the number in the first year after the war, the number of men has increased, while the number of women has gradually decreased, but it is still higher than before the war. It is feared that women will still come out to struggle and shoulder the burden of life with men as before. Gender distribution of job seekers (Table 1)

### Assessment of the Service Corps of Primary and Secondary School Teachers in the War Zone

(Chongqing Airmail) The Service Corps of Primary and Secondary School Teachers in the War Zone have been established one after another, with a total of nine corps. In addition to the members of each corps, the Ministry of Education also appointed a number of inspectors to participate in the work, and each corps established a director of inspection to preside over its affairs. In mid-October, the Ministry of Education issued instructions to the directors of inspection of each service corps, requiring them to strictly supervise and guide the work of each inspector, and pointed out that the task of each inspector is to inspect and assist the work of each member of the corps. Each director should carefully examine whether each inspector is competent for the assigned task, assess the merits and demerits of their work performance, and report them quickly for rewards and punishments.

### Finance - Foreign Exchange Tightened Sharply Followed by a Large Relaxation - British Gold at Five Shillings and American Exchange at Eight Yuan - Both Once Broke In But Eventually Returned

Other exchanges also decreased uniformly. The black market for British and American exchanges was still in a state of confusion, with sudden ups and downs in the middle, and the market was particularly uneasy. British gold was once forced below the five-shilling mark, and the American exchange rate also fell below the eight-yuan mark. The main buyers should be the Chinese merchants who were eager to turn from short to long and aggressively buy, as well as the Hong Kong merchants who changed their style and searched for goods. Moreover, most of the suppliers took the opportunity to raise prices, so the positions became tight and continued to tighten. The morning opening showed a tight British and American exchange rate because the American and British exchange rates decreased by another three fen, but soon the Chinese merchants took the lead in buying. Unexpectedly, HSBC had buying intentions. Before a moment had passed, the British gold had weakened directly to five shillings. Although exporters and Japanese and American banks came to the market to release their positions, the Hong Kong Electric and Youli suddenly seized the opportunity to drag in, so the positions were still unbalanced in supply and demand, and they broke through the five-shilling mark for British gold and the eight-yuan mark for American exchange. Although it eased slightly later, the market became tight again as the Chinese merchants bought heavily. The weakest British gold was once quoted at four shillings and eighty-seven and five pence, and the American exchange rate also reached seven yuan and eighty-seven and five fen. Fortunately, HSBC soon returned some positions, and the American and Japanese banks still had selling intentions, and the buyers also gradually thinned out. By noon, the British gold had returned to four shillings and ninety-six and eighty-five pence, and the American exchange rate had also relaxed to eight yuan and zero six two five fen. In the afternoon, the situation changed drastically, and the Chinese and Hong Kong merchants changed from buying to selling, gradually trending harder, reaching five shillings and twelve and five pence, and the American exchange rate also exceeded eight yuan and thirty-seven and five fen. Later, Youli's appetite was very strong, and it was once again tight to five shillings and eight yuan and twelve and five fen. At the close of the market, the British gold was still slightly relaxed to five shillings and zero six two five pence, and the American exchange rate was eight yuan and twenty-one and eighty-five fen. As a result, the British tightend by 0.03125, and the American weakened by 0.09375. The futures situation was similar to the spot market, and trading was still brisk throughout the day.

After the opening, the market trend became tight and soft because speculators continued to aggressively buy and HSBC had no supply intention, but instead had buying appetite. British gold weakened immediately to five shillings, and then Hong Kong Electric and Youli also came to buy in. However, at that time, exporters and Japanese and American banks lowered prices and released positions slightly. British gold for spot goods tightened from five shillings to four shillings and nine zero six two five pence, and the American exchange rate also softened from eight yuan and one two five fen to seven yuan and nine three seven five fen. The HSBC announced exchange rates opened with a decrease of 0.025 in the British exchange rate and a decrease of 0.05625 in the American exchange rate. The silver balance tax opened with a large increase of 0.25. After that, the American Bank of China and the Japanese Bank of Zhengjin had slightly more selling intentions, so the market trend turned around once. It is estimated that the foreign currency spot British gold at four shillings and nine three seven five pence and the spot American exchange at eight yuan were released to Hong Kong Electric Chinese merchants and foreign banks. However, at that time, Chinese merchants came to cover short positions on a large scale, so the situation trend became tight and soft again. It is estimated that Chinese merchants covered short positions in spot British gold at four shillings and nine three seven five pence of Datong Youli a certain bank, as well as British gold at four shillings and nine three seven five and eight seven five pence of this month and American exchange at seven yuan and nine three seven five and eight one two five fen of this month. Later, Hong Kong Electric Youli also settled foreign currency spot British gold at four shillings and eight seven five pence of HSBC and other foreign banks, as well as spot American exchange at seven yuan and eight seven five fen. Because the number of buyers gradually decreased, and American and Japanese banks continued to release positions, the market trend was seen to recover. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's selling price for spot goods was four shillings and nine six eight seven five pence for British gold and eight yuan and zero six one five fen for American exchange, which tightened British gold by 0.125 and softened American exchange by 0.12875 compared to the morning opening.

British and American Were Still Seen As Tight at the Close

At the beginning of the afternoon, the situation continued to recover because Hong Kong Electric suddenly came to throw out positions, and at the same time, the long positions of Chinese merchants were also closed. It is estimated that the spot British gold was sold to foreign banks from five shillings and zero three one two five to one two five, and the spot American exchange was from eight yuan and one eight seven five to three two five. Later, the hardest British gold was five shillings and one two five, and the bank was willing to release positions. The bank's buying price for American exchange was once quoted at over eight yuan and three seven five. Because Youli came to aggressively buy again, British gold was once again tight to five shillings and American exchange was eight yuan and one two five fen. After entering the market, the long positions of Chinese merchants came out again, so it was reported again to recover. Extended to the evening closing, the bank's selling price for spot goods was five shillings and zero six two five pence for British gold and eight yuan and one two eight seven five fen for American exchange, 5,046,875 pence for British gold for this month, and 8.1875 yuan for American exchange.

The Shanghai exchange rate increased by 1 yuan to 101.5 yuan. The black market for "United Notes" increased by 0.65 to 93.5 yuan. The market is soft.

### American Gold Notes Arrived - Twelve Yuan and Eight Jiao and a Half

Yesterday's foreign currency market was uncertain. Initially, it continued the tightening trend of the previous day, and the demand for British and American gold pounds was very high. The market was strong, and the absorption of British and American gold notes was even smoother. The American gold notes increased to 12 yuan and eight jiao and a half, but the increase was too high, which led to profit-taking supplies. At noon, it dropped back to 12 yuan and two jiao. In the afternoon, the supply continued to be strong, and the evening market was 12 yuan and one jiao. The supply of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dutch notes was not smooth, and the market was still strong. The demand for Annam notes was very weak, and the Japanese gold notes were slightly stronger. The evening market was 1 yuan and three jiao and five li. The supply of Korean notes was not strong, and it continued to be expensive. The evening market was 1 yuan and one jiao and two fen. Yesterday's market price, the American gold notes decreased by 0.15, the Hong Kong notes increased by 0.03, the Singapore notes and the Dutch notes both increased by 0.3, the Annam notes decreased by 0.05, and the other currencies did not change.

### Gold Market's Wild Rise and Fall: Peak at 3,850 Yuan, Hong Kong Investors Remain Major Patrons

Yesterday's spot gold market saw intense volatility due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, leading to significant price swings. Generally, the market initially rose before declining, with a difference of as much as 180 yuan between the highest and lowest prices. At the opening, the tight foreign exchange market fueled speculative buying, causing an immediate jump of 130 yuan to 3,800 yuan. Continued large purchases by Hong Kong investors pushed the price up another 50 yuan. However, this upward trend was short-lived. As foreign exchange rates slightly stabilized, money changers and securities firms suddenly began selling, causing an immediate drop to 3,755 yuan. Shortly thereafter, some money changers resumed buying, and as exchange rates tightened again, the price climbed back up to 3,825 yuan. However, as the noon hour approached, the foreign exchange market strengthened again, and rumors of the unlikelihood of peace in Europe led gold firms to take profits, resulting in a more significant decline. By the afternoon, the price had fallen to 3,670 yuan. Later, with continued tightness in the foreign exchange market, Hong Kong investors and day traders actively closed their positions, causing a surge of 90 yuan. Ultimately, the continued strength in foreign exchange rates led to a closing price of 3,730 yuan, up 60 yuan from the previous day's noon closing. Compared to the after-hours trading price of the previous day, this was also an increase of about 30 yuan. Trading volume remained high throughout the day, estimated at around 2,000 taels. Gold jewelry retailers ultimately raised their prices by 5 yuan, while customs gold prices remained stable.

Spot Gold Rises Another 60 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) carried the momentum from the previous day, and with reports of a sudden tightening in foreign exchange rates, brokers were eager to buy, driving up prices. By 9:10 AM, trading had begun, with the price jumping 130 yuan compared to the previous day's noon closing. A jewelry store bought 30 taels of gold for 3,800 yuan. Continuing shrinkage of foreign exchange and aggressive buying by a jewelry store on behalf of Hong Kong interests pushed the price up another 50 yuan. A money changer traded 20 taels for 3,850 yuan. As foreign exchange rates suddenly rebounded, selling pressure increased, with money changers and securities firms rushing to sell. The price soon fell by 80 yuan, with a securities firm selling 50 taels to a gold firm for 3,770 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange rates tightened again, buying interest revived, with a money changer buying on behalf of a client and another securities firm also actively absorbing supply. Although some gold firms took the opportunity to profit, their positions were still insufficient to meet demand, causing another rise of 55 yuan. The securities firm bought 30 taels from a jewelry store for 3,825 yuan. Subsequently, with foreign exchange rates strengthening again, money changers and jewelry stores rushed to sell, causing a decline. Soon, the price plummeted 90 yuan, with a securities firm selling 20 taels to a gold firm for 3,735 yuan. At noon, a gold firm made a small purchase, pulling the price up 10 yuan. A money changer sold 20 taels to a gold firm for 3,745 yuan, marking the noon closing price. In the afternoon, due to the strengthening of foreign exchange rates, money changers and a certain "Yu" firm aggressively sold, and with buyers on the sidelines, the market opened with a sharp drop of 55 yuan. A money changer sold 10 taels to a gold firm for 3,690 yuan. Later, a securities firm and a jewelry store (acting on behalf of Hong Kong interests) took advantage of the low prices to buy aggressively, causing an immediate rebound of 40 yuan. A securities firm traded 10 taels internally for 3,730 yuan. As foreign exchange rates continued to weaken, selling pressure returned, with jewelry stores frequently selling off. Simultaneously, some securities firms and individual speculators were eager to sell, causing a further decline below the 3,700 yuan mark. A money changer sold 20 taels to a jewelry store for 3,670 yuan. Subsequently, as foreign exchange rates suddenly tightened again, coupled with aggressive short covering by a gold firm and a money changer, and further buying by Hong Kong investors and securities firms, the price surged 90 yuan. A money changer bought 50 taels from a gold firm for 3,760 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange rates rebounded again, the price declined accordingly, soon falling by 45 yuan. A securities firm sold 30 taels to a gold firm for 3,715 yuan. Subsequently, a money changer stepped in to lift the price, causing a rise of 15 yuan. The money changer bought 20 taels from a gold firm for 3,730 yuan, marking the evening closing price. As a result, the price was up 60 yuan from the previous day's noon closing, and also about 30 yuan higher than the after-hours trading price of the previous day. With a total fluctuation of 180 yuan throughout the day, the cash gold firms were selling spot gold at a premium of 10 yuan over spot gold, while buying it back at a discount of over 20 yuan. Margined gold was trading at a discount of about 50 yuan to the listed price, with very little trading activity.

Gold Jewelry at 380 Yuan

The retail price of gold jewelry was initially 375 yuan per tael at major retailers. At 9:35 AM, the price increased by 10 yuan, then decreased by 5 yuan at 12:05 PM. At 2:15 PM, it fell another 5 yuan, and at 2:55 PM, it rose again by 5 yuan. Ultimately, major retailers revised the price to 380 yuan, with new retailers offering the same price. Buy-back prices were lowered by about 15 yuan.

### Securities: Foreign Shares Most Popular, Domestic Bonds Recover

The securities grey market saw significant fluctuations yesterday. Short sellers exerted strong downward pressure, hoping to shake the market's uncertain sentiment. However, their efforts proved insufficient, leading to short covering. Although market sentiment was weak, it had not reached a state of panic. Most investors still held the view of "buying low, selling high," which was not appropriate in the current environment. Therefore, most of the short positions were temporary in nature, and any turnaround in the situation would trigger a significant rebound. Short sellers were also paying close attention. Initially, at the opening yesterday morning, Jiufeng opened with Class C shares at 45.70 yuan, a sharp drop of more than one yuan compared to the previous day. Despite the strong downward pressure, there was no sustained selling, allowing short sellers to cover their positions. Tiansheng, Dafeng, Shengda, and others were actively buying, causing the market price to rise above the previous day's closing price. Simultaneously, Runli and Runheng continued to sell, but the market price did not weaken. In the afternoon, the market price saw little change due to balanced buying and selling, similar to the morning. Although the morning saw significant fluctuations, the overall result for the day was a slight increase of 0.10 to 0.40 yuan, with only Class D shares down 0.10 yuan. The total value of transactions was approximately 800,000 yuan. A simplified table is provided below.

Stock Trading: 20 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company stock were traded at a price of 29 yuan and 5 jiao each.

Yesterday, the stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce experienced many changes due to the fluctuating foreign exchange trends. The market opened weak but gradually improved. When trading began in the afternoon, the market became firm and lively again, as new accounts entered the market. However, this positive trend was short-lived. Profit-taking investors took the opportunity to sell, leading to a market decline. Fortunately, whenever stocks fell slightly, buyers stepped in to support the market, preventing a significant decline. Stocks that were previously unpopular became market favorites, and there was a slight increase in interest in rubber stocks, leading to significant trading volume.

London, 8th: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds have stabilized, and there have been no changes in the prices of various bonds. London, 8th: Today, the listed prices of Far East British companies' stocks have softened slightly. HSBC Bank's London-registered shares have fallen by half a pound to 85 pounds. Kulak-Lim rubber stocks have fallen by 8 pence to 19 shillings and 4 pence. Other stocks remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: White Cotton Transactions Strong, US Cotton Estimates Reduced Again

Cotton trading is gradually developing. However, selling prices are similar to those of the previous day. This is due to the recent decrease in the exchange rate of drafts and the increase in yarn prices by 20 to 30 yuan. At the same time, some yarn factories have released several thousand bales of yarn and slightly replenished their raw cotton to hedge. However, this is limited to transactions of white cotton. Japanese-owned Shanghai factories purchased 1,000 bales each of Tongzhou Fire Machine Cotton, all flood-delivered bales for factory value. Trading among industry peers is also active due to the stimulation of draft exchange rates. Therefore, trading to settle positions is also lively. Looking ahead, if the foreign exchange rate remains stable, there may be hope for improvement. From Northern Jiangsu, 1,449 bales of Tong cotton, 898 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 1,150 bales of Beisha cotton were delivered. The current cotton situation is listed below:

Washington: The US Department of Agriculture has released its fifth cotton production estimate of 11,845,000 bales, a decrease of 83,000 bales from the previous estimate of 11,928,000 bales.

Another report: Cotton trading in Shanghai has been relatively quiet due to the fluctuating exchange rates. However, factories remain active. Shenxin Factory released more than 4,000 bales of cotton yarn the day before yesterday, so it replenished more than 1,000 bales of American cotton yesterday. Industry peers are currently taking a wait-and-see approach, but their purchasing intentions remain very strong. Japanese factories have been relatively quiet regarding foreign cotton purchases, presumably because their needs have already been met.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was very active in the morning. Overseas cotton merchants were aggressively buying in the market. At the same time, the government has also announced a new loan program for new cotton in the future, which has stimulated buying interest and short covering. Closing prices were more than 10 points higher than the previous day. Indian cotton fell by 3 to 4 rupees, Egyptian cotton rose by more than 10 points, and Liverpool cotton fell by more than 4 pence.

### Speculators Take the Opportunity to Push Prices Up, Yarn Market Rises Again, "Double Horse" and "Flying Lady" Each Jump About 20 Yuan

The yarn market continues to rise, and the upward trend is very strong, mostly driven by enthusiastic speculation. Everyone is talking about the shrinking exchange rates and looking forward to rising prices, but actual demand remains very low. Therefore, apart from the "Double Horse" brand being a speculative target, other yarn markets are still firm but soft. The fundamental problem is that the foundation needs to be supported by actual sales, then it can be consolidated. However, at present, everyone is using exchange rate fluctuations as a tool. Although sales are narrow, it does not cause problems in the market.

Spot yarn opened in the morning carrying the momentum of the previous day, and industry peers were active again. Many said that the exchange rate was expected to shrink, and the number of buyers increased. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 650 yuan, up 10 yuan, but Guangzhou buyers were not very active. General operators used foreign exchange as a tool, and their enthusiasm for buying increased again. The market price rose step by step to 660 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day were only 920 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 20 yuan, Flying Lady rose by 17.5 yuan, and Double Globe rose by 19 yuan. Hongzhang Factory released 70 bales of 10-count Baoyi at a price of 505 yuan. Yesterday, there were 624 pieces in Hong Kong. The amount of each buyer is listed below.

### Food: Tight Control by Speculators Prevents Price Decline, Wuhu Indica Rice Available for Purchase and Transport, Refined Rice Market Stabilizes

Yesterday's heavy rain meant that only 2,000 to 3,000 packages of rice arrived from Sujia Kuntai Fengjia Qing Si, making the already weak market tighter. Since the decline from the previous peak, most owners of goods acquired at higher prices were unwilling to sell cheaply. This made the goods on the market even scarcer. At the same time, speculators seized on this weakness, aiming to buy at low prices and inquiring about prices. They focused on sourcing high-quality Jiangbei rice, and the limited supply on the market was quickly exhausted. When speculators were unable to acquire Jiangbei rice, they turned to Jingwu rice, but the supply was also limited. As a result, the market rose steadily, with the closing price of Jiangbei rice at 23.5 yuan, settled at 23 yuan; Jingwu rice at 23.7 yuan, settled at 22.5 yuan. Other types of rice, such as new refined rice and Tea Kiln variety, were active in the morning, and local shops were also buying. However, as speculators sold off at high prices, the market was flooded, and the market softened and sales became slow. As a result, the market only stabilized, without any significant gains or losses. As the supply of Luyang high-quality rice was limited and the existing stocks were weak, and it was also very popular with shops, the market was extremely firm. Therefore, once there was activity, the market immediately rose. Yesterday's trading volume was very high, with prices increasing by 4 to 5 jiao. The situation remains tight, and there are also signs of a slight recovery.

After the market opened yesterday morning, Ke Xian rice prices had retreated, prompting Ke merchants and miscellaneous stores to add to their inventories. Sources from various regions remained scarce, and Japanese firms lacked complete sales. Merchants and speculators took the opportunity to quote higher prices, and Ke Xian rice prices rose to 23.8 yuan, a steep increase of half a yuan compared to the previous market. However, in the afternoon, merchants offered Wan Xian rice for future delivery, which began to stabilize market sentiment. However, the Jiangbei merchants have begun trial transport of Wuhu rice, and there are rumors that it will arrive soon. Also, the current Xian rice price is gradually approaching the price of Jing rice, and so industry insiders are expecting the market may stabilize.

According to reports, high-quality Jiangbei Xian rice is worth 20.05 yuan in Shanghai, and mass-market goods are worth around 20 yuan. Merchants in Shanghai are still afraid to transport rice due to previous losses, while local merchants in Jiangbei have already transported small batches of dozens or hundreds of bags. Early shipments could have arrived in Shanghai, but were intercepted and sold in Chongtong area due to rice shortages.

Wuhu Xian rice has traditionally been monopolized by the Japanese Mitsui & Co. Recently, due to requests from smaller Japanese trading companies to the Asian Development Board to open it up, several batches of transport permits have been issued to small trading companies since November 1. Small trading companies, due to their own weakness, often cooperate with Chinese merchants, or sell the transport fee to merchants at a fee of 2 yuan to 3.5 yuan per bag. Therefore, Wuhu rice may arrive soon.

### Flour Mill Prices Reduced by 1 Jiao, Wheat Market Stalls with No Transactions

Yesterday, the flour mill's price for flour fell by 1 jiao, with the official price of No. 2 flour changing to 7.3 yuan in cash. However, sales remained normal. This is because the Yangtze River area is currently flooded with flour from the mainland, and shipments are also arriving in Shanghai, which is having an impact on the market. It is said that the price of Cannon Car flour must still be 4 jiao, while sales to both northern and southern customers are sporadic. The local market is only meeting daily needs. Returns have seen a gradual easing in the market, but there is no formal market, and total transactions are only 30,000 packages.

There were 4,000 to 5,000 packages of wheat, and the goods that arrived were prepared to be stored in warehouses and were unwilling to be put on display. This is because the price of flour is trending downwards, and the raw materials are naturally affected. However, the sellers are holding on to their goods and unwilling to sell because of the high cost. As a result, factories and customers have not formally agreed on any transactions.

### Oil Market: Crude Oil Prices Surge

Yesterday's peanut oil market saw a sudden tense situation. The foreign exchange grey market weakened sharply, Hong Kong buyers were actively buying, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in a surge of more than 3 yuan. A total of 200 cases of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 57 yuan, 100 barrels of Tianjin barrel oil at a price of 73 yuan, 1,000 cans of Yantai canned oil at a price of 73 yuan, and 400 cans of Jiangbei canned oil at a price of 74 yuan. Soybean oil was potentially weak. Although Kobe and Dalian barrel oil were tightly held and not opened, the selling price of bagged oil loosened, slightly lower than the previous day's market by 2 jiao. 200 cases of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 48.4 yuan, and 100 cans of Yantai canned oil at a price of 66.5 yuan.

According to news from Xiangtianxiang Trading Company, the price of Dutch white sugar was 7.18 Dutch guilders, an increase of 0.08, and the Dutch exchange rate shrank by 375. Therefore, the association's price continued to rise. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar was about 53 yuan, the price of goods in outside warehouses was 53.8 yuan to 53.3 yuan, the price of Taikoo car white sugar increased by half, the price of West Warehouse B was 57 yuan, and the price of East Warehouse B was 57 yuan. The price was determined by tax refund. There were bids for red Dutch sugar and red road sugar, but no transactions. The price of No. 1 fine white sugar was 53.5 yuan, No. 2 was 53 yuan, No. 3 was 52.5 yuan, and No. 4 was 52 yuan. The trend of domestic sugar remained flat and soft, with only bids and no transactions.

### North-South Goods: Shima Dried Longans More Expensive Than Usual

Due to the extreme shortage of Shima sun-dried longans and the rising prices at the origin, the market has suddenly become tight. Only two boxes arrived recently, and it is said that the price has increased by nearly 10 yuan compared to the initial price. Compared to the low price in early summer, the increase is more than two-thirds.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Market Trading Not Prosperous

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market strengthened, and yarn and thread prices rose across the board. Cloth prices also turned firm after falling, and bids increased slightly. However, actual sales were sluggish, and the market had excessive inventory. Therefore, the market atmosphere was still loose, and many were trying to sell. Most buyers were taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the buying and selling atmosphere in the market was not strong. White goods, coarse cloth, and printed satin were selling well. Buyers from Zhejiang and Wenzhou-Ningbo purchased nearly 200 packages of coarse cloth and 50 to 60 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, and colored twill. Buyers from Fujian and Guangdong purchased more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, and serge. Local buyers purchased 100-odd pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, printed and bleached cloth. Overseas buyers from Mumbai and other places added 5,000-odd pieces of printed satin and other goods. Hong Kong buyers purchased 100-odd pieces of fine twill, satin, grey cloth, and fine cloth.

The morning market for Dongpi white goods and fine cloth was strong. The high price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached 18.75 yuan per piece. As actual sales flattened, the market began to loosen. Dong Cotton offered spot Dragon Head fine cloth for only 18.5 yuan, and Blue Double Fish fine twill for 17.1 yuan. Therefore, the market atmosphere turned downward in the afternoon, and bids for fine cloth fell to 18.6 yuan. The morning price of Four Gentlemen serge reached 6 jiao 2 fen 2 li and a half per yard, but then fell to 6 jiao 0 fen 7 li and a half to 1 fen. Throughout the day, local traders traded 500 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill.

### Chongqing is Full of Optimism, China is Determined to Fight a Protracted War, Wartime Capital Shows Active Posture, People's Belief in Victory is Exceptionally Strong, Reflections of the Associated Press Far East General Manager on Visiting Chongqing

Mr. Maurice, Far East General Manager of the Associated Press of America, has just returned to Shanghai after touring China's wartime capital. According to him, "Based on the strength of China's political institutions, capable of supporting a protracted war, and the continuous training of countless troops, continuously sent to the front lines to provide reinforcements and achieving great feats, Chongqing is full of optimism. This belief is clearly demonstrated in any location in the city, from official proclamations to countless construction workers, with a determination to succeed naturally revealed in their words.

China Shows No Signs of Weakness

For this reason, I am very surprised that former Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's remarks to me were misunderstood as indicating some signs of weakness in the Chinese government. Dr. Wang, in response to my inquiries, spoke of mediation and peace, leading one to imagine that the war might be coming to an end. However, to interpret this answer as a sign of China's weakness is a great mistake. The distance between this and the truth is as far as Chongqing is from Tokyo, or perhaps even farther." In Chongqing, in addition to his famous interview with Foreign Minister Wang, Mr. Maurice also met with Executive Yuan President Kong Xiangxi, Secretary-General of the National Defense Supreme Council Zhang Qun, Secretary-General of the War Zone Party and Government Committee Shao Lizi, Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth War Zone General Li Zongren, and had long conversations with Minister of Propaganda Ye Chucang, Deputy Minister Dong Xianguang, and President of the Central News Agency Xiao Tongzi.

US-Japan Conflict Almost Inevitable

Mr. Maurice continued, "The leaders I met were quite satisfied with the trend of the international situation and were very pleased with the recent tough attitude taken by the United States towards Japan. They pointed out that Japan's ambitious actions inevitably lead to conflict with the United States on many points. In addition, my personal observation has proved that Sichuan Province's abundance of natural resources is not an exaggeration. This is the land of plenty, allowing anyone to live comfortably relying on geographical advantages.

Transport System Gradually Improving

The transportation industry in the Chinese mainland is constantly improving and progressing steadily. However, the transportation cost from Kunming to Chongqing remains high. Therefore, any foreign goods are considered a luxury consumption in Chongqing. However, according to the expectations of American transportation consulting experts, after the establishment of a new transportation system, passenger and freight water rates will immediately decrease. This new transportation system is moving forward.

Chongqing Construction Rapidly Developing

The construction of Chongqing is progressing rapidly, similar to the two sides of the land being pushed forward. The above-ground construction covers a wide area, and the underground air-raid shelters are also being excavated extensively. The roar sounds from fast places from time to time, as if the artillery is roaring, but is actually the sound of exploding rock caves, which are used to supplement the air-raid shelters. The flying debris and gravel are collected and used to pave the roads.

Air-Raid Shelters Safe and Comfortable

The air-raid shelters in Chongqing are now sufficient for use. Therefore, as soon as the air-raid alarm sounds, people calmly walk into the shelters to take temporary refuge. Some may carry books, some may hold canvas chairs, and read by the light of kerosene lamps or hand torches. Some may crack melon seeds in the shelters and chat with their relatives and friends. In this war, a rapidly progressing achievement should be commended as the aviation industry, which I have never seen more than this. The six-hour Chongqing-Hong Kong flight of China National Aviation Corporation now flies almost daily, and is comfortable and reliable.

### National Government's October Relief Funds, Telegraphic Transfer to Shanghai, Deeply Touched by Benevolence

The National Government is deeply concerned about the people suffering from the disaster throughout the country, and is doing its best to provide relief. In the recent water disaster in North China, there is no discrimination due to the occupied areas. Since the August 13th Incident in Shanghai, the National Government's Relief Committee has allocated 100,000 yuan monthly. It is now known that the 100,000 yuan for October of this year has already been telegraphically transferred to Shanghai. The original telegram from the First Relief Zone of this city receiving the remittance from the Relief Committee is recorded below (above omitted). We will first apportion the telegraphic transfer of 100,000 yuan for the you month (August in the Chinese calendar) from the Four Banks, and immediately contact to receive it, separately transfer it, and first repay the loan. Relief Committee, East, Yu, National Government. At this time when the Anti-Japanese war expenses are huge, they still allocate monthly funds to benefit the refugees in Shanghai, deeply touched by the benevolence.

### French Ambassador, Cosme, Leaves for Chongqing Yesterday, Long Stay in Chongqing, Discussing All Issues with the Central Government

French Ambassador to China, Cosme, left Shanghai yesterday afternoon to visit the central authorities of China for a routine visit. The French Ambassador took the Dutch Java Company's Shiba de steamer south to Hong Kong, then took a warship to Haiphong, and met with the Governor-General of Vietnam, Catroux, for a short stay. Then, he transferred to Chongqing. The Shiba de was docked at the Lanyan Con wharf in Pudong. It was originally scheduled to depart at 2:00 PM yesterday, but was postponed to 4:00 PM due to weather conditions. When the French Ambassador took the Jianghai Customs small ship across the river to Pudong to board the ship, the French Concession Police Station and the Bund area were temporarily added with police, with strict security, and a guard of honor was deployed. Those who saw him off included French Embassy Military Counselor Yihong, Commercial Counselor, French Consul General Baudiczi, Director of the French Municipal Council Bredi, Commander of the French Defense Forces Colonel Grigny, and Polish Charge d'Affaires to China Ross. Ambassador Cosme's trip to Chongqing will have a long stay, and will discuss all issues with the central authorities in a spirit of friendship. In addition, there are rumors that US Ambassador Dr. Johnson will leave Chongqing for Shanghai. It is confirmed that Ambassador Johnson is scheduled to leave Chongqing for Hong Kong by plane on the 10th, then go to Beijing to meet his family. Ambassador Johnson will take the opportunity to come to Shanghai to meet with Commander-in-Chief of the Asian Fleet, Admiral Hurd, to discuss all issues. The date of return will be in the spring.

### Premier's Birthday Celebration Preparations

The city is preparing to hang flags to celebrate Premier's birthday on November 12th. All schools will also be closed as usual. However, that day happens to be Sunday. Due to the current national crisis, most do not intend to make up for the holiday. The Public Concession Bureau will be closed on the 13th as usual to express congratulations to Premier Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who devoted his life to the revolution, founded the Republic of China, and his great achievements are respected by the country as the Father of the Nation. As winter is approaching and the soldiers are suffering from the cold, the city has decided to concentrate its efforts on the day of celebration to continue raising money for winter clothing to achieve the goal of doubling the donations. In addition, the city's charities are also calling on the refugees staying in Shanghai, hoping that people from all walks of life will donate winter clothing, quilts, or old clothes, children's shoes and hats, etc., so that they can survive the winter. The authorities of the two concessions, fearing that unscrupulous elements will take the opportunity to cause trouble, have started preparations for prevention and inspection to prevent accidents.

### Obstructing the Circulation of Legal Tender in Shanghai: All Nations Will Not Permit It; Shanghai's Legal Tender Supply Is Sufficient and Will Not Affect Citizens' Livelihoods

The puppet "Reformed Government," in order to promote its "Huaxing Notes," through its "Jianghai Customs Superintendent" Li Jiannan, requested the consuls of various countries in Shanghai and the Jianghai Customs Commissioner Luo to prohibit the import of Chinese legal tender. Although the consuls of various countries and Commissioner Luo did not accept this request, the black market for foreign exchange and gold in Shanghai is seeing speculative elements ready to make trouble again, causing intense market fluctuations. The details are as follows:

Headed Down the Same Road As Accepting Puppet Currency

Although Jianghai Customs Commissioner Lordford did not accept the request of "Superintendent" Li Jiannan, and has not issued any order prohibiting the import of legal tender, due to the situation in Shanghai, there are fears that he will repeat the mistake of accepting "Huaxing Notes." Because Jianghai Customs accepted "Huaxing Notes" on September 1st of this year, Commissioner Luo did not issue any order. Therefore, the transportation of legal tender to Shanghai by the four banks—Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China—will likely be obstructed. However, since the retreat of the National Army to the west, the four banks immediately stopped transporting legal tender.

Foreign Banks Transporting Currency to Provide Relief

In order to maintain a proper supply in the Shanghai market, various Allied banks in Shanghai contacted the head offices of the four banks—Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China—to have the Allied banks transport legal tender to Shanghai for relief. For example, the American President Lines' President Pierce, which recently arrived in Shanghai, carried ten million yuan in Chinese legal tender, which belongs to the American Chase Bank. Although the "Jianghai Customs Superintendent" attempted to obstruct it, it was safely unloaded due to the foreign merchants' involvement. The various Allied banks have decided to ignore the superintendent's request and are firmly opposed to it.

Affecting Various Countries' Trade with China

A reporter from New Voice News learned from banking circles yesterday that the amount of legal tender circulating in the Shanghai concession area is quite large and sufficient to meet needs. Therefore, forcibly preventing legal tender from coming to Shanghai will not affect the livelihoods of citizens. As for the Chinese legal tender transported to Shanghai by foreign banks, it is entirely for international trade. If the "puppet superintendent" insists on acting arbitrarily, it will cause significant losses to various countries' trade with China, and the various countries will inevitably lodge serious protests. According to sources from foreign banks, the legal tender being transported belongs to them, and the "superintendent" has no right to interfere.

Speculation Stirring Up the Market

The black markets for foreign exchange and gold in Shanghai are beyond the reach of the government's temporary authority, and are entirely manipulated by speculative merchants for profit. Recently, due to the improvement in China's foreign trade, funds from Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places have returned to Shanghai, causing the black market for foreign exchange to ease and the black market for gold to plummet. Speculators dared not manipulate the market again, and the entire financial system gradually returned to normal. Since "Jianghai Customs Superintendent" Li Jiannan attempted to prevent legal tender from coming to Shanghai, a group of speculators have again contemplated making trouble, deliberately spreading rumors. However, it is expected that they will ultimately suffer a crushing defeat.

Black Market for Gold, Foreign Exchange, and Securities

### Yang Jinhai and Luo Zhibin Shot Dead Yesterday; Both Worked for the Japanese; They Died from Gunshots While Hosting a Banquet in a Restaurant

At 7:20 PM yesterday, the Wanli Restaurant at 514 Fuzhou Road was crowded with guests and brightly lit. Suddenly, a shooting occurred at banquet tables 22 and 23 on the second floor. Yang Jinhai and Luo Zhibin, who were working for the Japanese military police as special agents, were shot dead on the spot. The details are as follows:

Strong Men Entered the Room and Opened Fire

Four or five days ago, a man named Yang Jinhai reserved five tables of banquets for 20 yuan each at the restaurant. Around 7 PM yesterday, the invited guests arrived in succession, reaching forty or fifty people. As they were taking their seats, just as the cold dishes were being served and before anyone had raised their cups, five or six strong men in black robes suddenly appeared. One to three of them stayed at the entrance of the restaurant to keep watch, while three others rushed upstairs, entered Yang Jinhai's reserved banquet rooms 22 and 23. Looking around, they saw Yang and Luo sitting side-by-side at the northwest end of the room. The three strong men immediately rushed to the table and opened fire on them. Everyone at the banquet, who had been in high spirits, was terrified upon hearing the gunshots and scrambled to escape.

Yang and Luo Killed on the Spot

At that time, the restaurant's tea servers and bookkeepers also heard the gunshots and hid on Fuzhou Road. Other guests at the restaurant also rushed down from the second floor. In this extremely tense situation, the three strong men continued to fire more than ten shots. Yang Jinhai was shot three times in the head, and Luo Zhibin was shot four times in the waist. Both died on the spot. The other people at the table were not affected. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the assassins calmly went downstairs, exited the restaurant among the crowd, and fled east towards Hubei Road, disappearing without a trace.

Police Arrived and Investigated

After the incident, nearby police officers arrived after hearing the alarm. Because the assassins had already escaped without a trace, they transported the two dead men to Renji Hospital, and then transferred them to the coroner's office to await examination by the First Special District Court. After receiving the report, the police sent a large number of detectives to the scene to investigate, and collected the remaining bullets for filing and investigation. They also intensified their efforts to track down the assassins to find out the truth.

The Deceased Both Worked for the Japanese

Yang Jinhai, 41 years old, was from Yangzhou. He was a burly man who lived at 21 Xinle Village, Singapore Road. He was previously a barber and was penniless. Since taking a puppet position, he has acquired assets worth tens of thousands. He is currently the deputy captain of the Japanese military police's self-defense force. Luo Zhibin, over 30 years old, was also from Yangzhou. He was a slender man who lived at 4 Yongle Village, Jixifei Road in western Shanghai. He used to live in Japan and worked as a barber. After the war, Luo returned to China and was introduced to the Japanese West District Military Police Special Task Force in western Shanghai as a translator. Recently, a special task force was established at Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road, with Zhang Jirong (i.e., Little Jirong) as the captain and Luo Zhibin as the deputy.

### Heavy Fighting Along the Jinghu and Huhang Railways; Tensions High in Changzhou, Suzhou, and Hangzhou; Japanese Troops South of the Huangpu Rely on Japanese Warships for Protection

Recently, the regular Chinese army and guerrilla forces have launched fierce attacks on the Japanese troops along the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) railways and in various towns in southern Jiangsu. According to someone from Danyang, the recent situation there is as follows:

Four Vehicles Destroyed Near Benniu

Around midnight on the 1st of this month, a train of military vehicles traveling from Nanjing triggered a landmine between Benniu and Xin'an (in Wujin County) at the Lianjiang Bridge. There was a loud explosion, and thick smoke rose into the air. One locomotive and three freight cars were destroyed, causing extremely heavy losses. However, the number of casualties is unknown. It is said that the landmine was planted by a mobile unit of southern Jiangsu. After the incident, traffic between Changzhou and Danyang on the Jinghu Railway was interrupted until the 3rd, when it was repaired and reopened.

Passengers on the Jinghu Railway Are Wary

According to the visitor, near Shitangwan, west of Wuxi, and near Weiting, east of Suzhou, he witnessed several sections of train cars that had been destroyed by bombings, lying on the side of the road. The car bodies were completely destroyed, with only the chassis remaining, lying askew in the autumn grass. Because train bombings frequently occur on the Jinghu Railway, passengers are wary when taking the train and dare not take the early trains departing from Nanjing and Shanghai to avoid unforeseen circumstances.

Chinese Troops in Changzhou Planning a Counterattack

According to someone from Changzhou, although the fighting in the southwestern villages of Wujin has come to an end, it is rumored that the Chinese Tenth Army is planning a major counterattack in conjunction with other regular troops and local forces. As a result, the Japanese troops stationed in towns such as Nieli, Xiaxi, and Chengzhang dare not withdraw. Residents in the city live in fear every day, and the market is depressed. Some people have fled to Shanghai to take refuge. The Japanese army's inspection of passengers on the Jinghu Railway has also become more strict. The gates of Suzhou have been opened and closed sporadically for more than ten days.

Tense Situation in Hangzhou

The situation in Hangzhou has been very tense since the Chinese troops under General Tian mobilized along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. According to railway sources, merchants in Hangzhou have begun to withdraw their goods in recent days. On the day before yesterday, there were as many as four trains loaded with goods coming to Shanghai. Japanese merchants also had a considerable amount of goods.

Chinese Troops in Southern Pudong Successfully Linked Up

The towns and villages in Tangwan Township, which belongs to Shanghai County, have been recovered by the Second Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Force. The Chinese side has also organized a wartime county government in a certain place to command the troops, successfully linking up the various units from Qingpu, Sijing, Qibao, along the Caohejing River in western Shanghai to Tianmashan Mountain in Songjiang, and along the Shangsong Highway at Changqiao, Huiqiao, across Qianbu Canal, Xinqiao, Xinzhuang, and Zhuanqiao Qianliang Temple. The Japanese troops in Beiqiao are surrounded on both sides. During the day, they only guard the traffic line on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, and in the evening they gather at the headquarters in Minhang and Beiqiao. Therefore, from 6:00 PM onwards, the Shanghai-Minhang Highway is bustling with guerrillas. The sentries on both sides of the highway can see each other, and the sound of gunfire is constant throughout the night. The Japanese troops dare not interfere. The vanguard of the guerrilla forces on the south bank of the Huangpu River has reached the edge of the river, guarding against the Japanese troops. Helpless, in order to protect the Japanese troops on both banks, there are as many as six warships in the southern Huangpu River, one at the blockade line, one at the Longhua Cement Factory, one at Tangkou, one at Zha Port, one at Guan Port, and one at Minhang. At night, searchlights shine in all directions to show intimidation.

### Schools Commemorate Ma Xiangbo; One Day of Mourning; No Restrictions on Outside Participation

The Shanghai community initiated a memorial service for the centenarian Ma Xiangbo. A preparatory committee was established at the Bankers' Club on a day prior, and the organizational structure of the preparatory committee was formed. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 13th to discuss all preparatory matters. Fudan and Aurora Universities in the city have also scheduled separate memorial ceremonies on the 15th of this month. The Aurora University Board of Directors issued a notice to all faculty and students yesterday that they would attend the Catholic Church on Luban Road at that time, and the school would not impose any restrictions on external participation. It is hoped that various groups and Catholic friends will actively participate and join in the grand event. It is said that the memorial mass ceremony will be presided over by one bishop and two priests. The bishop plans to invite Zhu Xianmei, Ma's nephew Zhu Zhiyao's brother and the current bishop of Haimen District, to preside. One of the priests is Father Cai Ermeng, a member of the Aurora University Board of Directors, and the other has not yet been decided. If Bishop Zhu is unable to come to Shanghai, the ceremony will be presided over by Father Cai Ermeng. The Fudan University memorial service has been undertaken by the Fudan Alumni Association. There are no fewer than several thousand alumni from the university and the affiliated high school, who, although now scattered in various places, still have a considerable number remaining in Shanghai. The school will be presided over by President Li Denghui. On that day, in addition to suspending classes for one day, all faculty and students will wear black cloth to mourn for one day to show their condolences.

### US Marine Corps Postpones Grand Exercise Due to Deep Water Accumulation at the Racecourse

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the 4th US Marine Corps in Shanghai, originally scheduled to hold a parade at the racecourse tomorrow (the 10th) to commemorate the 164th anniversary of its founding, has indefinitely postponed the parade and reception due to the accumulation of water at the racecourse, which is unlikely to dry out in a few days.

### China's Resistance Against Japan Is Actually Fighting for the United States; The United States Should Fully Assist China; Further Tolerance Will Lead to Regret; The Candid Remarks of American Economist Babson

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that Babson, a prominent American economist, recently returned to the United States from the Orient and expressed his opinion that China, in its war of resistance against Japan, is actually fighting for the United States and should therefore receive assistance from the United States. The Sino-Japanese War has now exhausted the Japanese people, and they may have deeply regretted provoking this war. It is generally believed that the reproductive rate of the Chinese people will eventually drive the Japanese troops out of China. At the same time, if the United States does not provide more assistance, China's position will inevitably be unfavorable. The Japanese people are indeed industrious and worthy of friendship, but the Japanese military can only be compared to Stalin and Hitler in terms of their evil deeds. The Japanese invasion of China will be the most brutal and unreasonable act in history. The Japanese military leaders are unrestrained, and their attack on China is only because China has finally begun to strengthen itself. They fear that if China acquires machinery and production, it will cause Japanese commerce to plummet, and they openly admit that this is a never-to-be-repeated opportunity.

The Cruelty of the Japanese Troops Is Like That of Savages

I (Babson speaking) was appalled by the destruction I witnessed in China. In addition, I have personally spoken with reliable consuls, merchants, and missionaries from the interior, and they all believe that the actions of the more than one million Japanese soldiers in China are like those of a group of cruel and desperate savages. Murder, rape, torture, and destruction are not enough to describe their crimes.

Chinese Assets Moved to the Interior

The normally peace-loving Chinese people have been greatly stimulated to rise up and resist, using the most ingenious strategies and guerrilla warfare to defend themselves. There are few positional battles between the two armies, but they are divided into small units, fighting anytime and anywhere. The most hopeful sign in the whole incident is that 400 million people are carrying machinery, tools, and livestock from the densely populated cities of eastern China to the rich and undeveloped western provinces. Hundreds of factories have traveled thousands of miles to the interior, and railway tracks are being dismantled and transported inward by coolies. Thousands of new cooperative industries are now being established in the new western regions.

Japanese Troops Only Control Transportation Lines

Japan now occupies many of China's ports, but smuggling of goods in and out is still being carried out on a large scale. The Japanese army controls most of the areas east of the Pinghan and Yuehan Railways to the coast, but there are still millions of people in this area who have never seen a Japanese soldier. To the west of these two railways, 300 million people continue to work as usual.

China Has the Power to Drive Out the Japanese Troops

The Chinese government has moved to Chongqing, which is impregnable. Although it is bombed every week or two, the damage is minimal. It is foolish for anyone to predict how long the Sino-Japanese War will last. It is generally believed that the reproductive rate of the Chinese people alone will eventually drive the Japanese troops out of China. From what I have seen in Japan, the war has exhausted the Japanese people, and they may have deeply regretted provoking this war.

The United States Should Provide Economic Assistance

But on the other hand, the United States must provide greater economic assistance to the Chinese government, or at least cut off supplies to the Japanese troops. Otherwise, China will inevitably be at a disadvantage. In fact, China is currently fighting for the same principles as it would for the people of Hawaii. I believe that the current attitude of the US government in assisting the Japanese troops is suicidal. The people of Hawaii should do their utmost to assist China, at least until the current European war ends and Britain and France are free to take action in the East.

The Task of the United States Is Fivefold

In order to succeed the United States must complete the following five tasks: (1) Curb the blind religious belief of Japan that it is destined to rule all of Asia, including Hawaii; (2) Prevent the Soviet Union from spreading communism in China as the price for assisting China's resistance against Japan; (3) Engage in humanitarian service, saving 25 million innocent men, women, and children from slaughter and suffering; (4) Salvage valuable American trade and shipping in China, which is essential for the United States to solve its unemployment problem; (5) Protect our 500 million yuan in church property that we have spent a century building up. In short, we are now mistakenly showing tolerance, and if we continue to tolerate it, we will regret it in the future.

### Patrol Police Arrest Man Carrying a Gun; Bust Arms Agency; Confessed to Planning Assassination of a Certain Person

The French Concession Police Department, recently due to the approach of winter defense, has been extraordinarily strict with defense within the concession in recent days. In addition to the full deployment of armored vehicles on patrol, patrol teams are divided into groups to patrol and search various roads. At 7:45 the night before last, a number of Chinese and Western detectives from the patrol team were patrolling at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet when they suddenly saw a man with a panicked expression. They immediately stepped forward to search him and found a six-inch pistol and eleven bullets on him. After taking him back to the police station, he confessed that his name was Wang A'yu, 30 years old, from Ningbo. He confessed that he was ordered to go to a certain address in Fengyuli on Route Paul Henry to assassinate a certain person surnamed. He also confessed that the general agency was located at 253 Route Tenant de la Tour. According to the confession, the police immediately dispatched a large team of detectives to the address and found a huge amount of arms in the house. However, when they entered, the house was empty, so no one was apprehended. The police station is currently investigating the case.

### Cold Wave Hits Shanghai; Drastic Change in Climate

According to a United Press reporter who inquired with the observatory, a northern high-pressure system is now moving towards southern China, so Shanghai is about to be hit by a cold wave. Yesterday morning, the temperature in Peiping had already dropped to two degrees below zero. The climate there is already extremely cold. Shanghai has had intermittent rain for several days, and the rainfall became more rapid in the afternoon the day before yesterday. The wind and rain continued all night, and water dripped continuously from the eaves. The climate has also changed drastically. The temperature dropped to 57 degrees at 9:00 AM (it was 69.4 degrees at 9:00 AM the day before), and the weather was particularly bad.

### Beixin Bookstore Warehouse Forcibly Evicted; Hundreds of Boxes of Books Soaked in Water; Losses of Tens of Thousands of Yuan; Will Sue According to Law

The Xuyuan (Xu Garden) on Route Combault in western Shanghai is owned by the brothers Xu Guanyun and Xu Lingyun. After the "August 13th" Incident, they rented it to the Beixin Bookstore as a warehouse at a relatively low price. Later, part of the rear of the garden was used as a refugee shelter, housing several thousand refugees for many years. Most of the buildings were badly damaged. The owners repeatedly requested that the shelter be evacuated by a certain date. Later, the shelter was dissolved due to a shortage of funds, and the damaged buildings were repaired once, with losses exceeding several thousand yuan. Then, the Beixin Bookstore used the remaining repaired houses to establish Jianxing Middle School, widely admitting aspiring students. Unexpectedly, the owners of Xuyuan, on the grounds that the contract stated that it could not be sublet, sued the school in court, demanding that part of the school be evacuated, but to no avail. In the heavy rain on the 8th, the owners Xu Guanyun and Xu Lingyun led dozens of workers to the garden and forcibly moved three or four hundred boxes of books from the bookstore, throwing them on the desolate field. All the books were soaked in water, causing losses of more than tens of thousands of yuan. It is said that Beixin Bookstore, due to the owners' use of force and the huge losses suffered, has decided to sue in court.

### Two Arrested in Chen Lu Assassination Case

News Agency reported that the Japanese side publicly announced yesterday that after Chen Lu, the puppet "Reformed Government" Foreign Minister, was assassinated in western Shanghai on February 19 of this year, the Japanese military police arrested two important figures in the case, Fu Ning native Ping Hu and Songjiang native Tan Baoyi, on June 29 at 14 Avenue du Roi Albert, Avenue Joffre, in the French Concession. The pair confessed to acting under the leadership of their superior You Heqing to carry out the shooting at Chen's residence, and then left by car. A few days later, they separately traveled by ship to Hong Kong, and came to Shanghai again in late June. At the same time, Japanese newspapers in Shanghai published photos of Ping and Tan.

### Tenants of Kangyi Lane Oppose Rent Increase; Write to the Taxpayers' Association to Stop It

The houses in Kangyi Lane, 39 Route Conty, in the French Concession, are managed by the Jiyi Real Estate Company. The rent was already high, and after two rent increases in 1930 and 1938, the owner suddenly notified the tenants that the rent would be increased by another 30% on top of the original rent. The tenants, upon hearing the news, felt that at this extraordinary time, the owner's repeated large rent increases were not considerate of the people's hardships, so they wrote to the owner asking him to withdraw the order. Yesterday, the tenants jointly wrote to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, asking them to uphold justice and find a way to stop it.

### Raising Funds for Refugee Winter Clothing; Holding Variety Show

This solo exhibition will feature more than 140 works, all of which are masterpieces from his travels in the southwest.

### Kato Gaimusho's Arrival in Shanghai; Will Visit Nanjing and Wuhan; Rumor Was That He Went to Nanshi Yesterday

Japanese special envoy Kato Gaimusho returned to his post on the Nagasaki Maru on the 7th, and arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 PM on the prior day (the 8th). Kato's arrival in Shanghai this time is to discuss various issues with the diplomatic representatives of third countries stationed in Shanghai, to supplement the negotiations between Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Kichisaburo and British Ambassador Craigie and American Ambassador Grew in Tokyo. He will also visit Nanjing, Hankou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou. At 2:00 PM yesterday, four Japanese cars passed through Xinkai River and headed towards Nanshi. The first car carried three senior Japanese officers and one Japanese in Western clothing. The following three cars carried nineteen armed Japanese soldiers. It is rumored that the person in Western clothing was Kato.

### The Panama Incident Under Investigation; After the US Consulate Protests; The Japanese Side Has Responded

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that it was learned this morning (the 9th) that regarding the detention of the Panamanian ship Polivar, after the US Consulate in this city, representing the government of that country, protested, the Japanese authorities are continuing their investigation. It is said that after the US Consulate protested last week, it received a reply from the Japanese Consulate, stating that it was investigating the detention of the ship. In the past few days, the Japanese authorities have continued to investigate. It is reported that the Polivar was detained by Japanese special agents three weeks ago after arriving in Shanghai from southern China. A Chinese second mate who was arrested has not yet been released.

### Following Successive Declines in Rice and Commodity Prices, Living Expenses Show Initial Reduction; Slight Decline After a Sharp Monthly Increase in the Cost of Mental Labor; Common People Psychologically Begin to Feel Slightly Relieved

Since December of last year, for ten months, the cost of living index for workers in this city has risen continuously. Only in October did it begin to decrease. The index for October was 248.22, a decrease of 12.36% compared to 283.23 in September. The purchasing power of currency also increased accordingly. In October, one yuan of legal tender (Fa Bi) in the 25th year of the Republic (1936) was worth 40.29 cents. The classified index showed that the fuel category decreased by 21.78% compared to the previous month, and the food category decreased by 8.98%. Clothing and miscellaneous items increased, with clothing increasing by 10.20% and miscellaneous items by 5.610%. This index is still higher than in August, but after months of sharp increases, it is now initially decreasing. The hardship of the common people's lives is shocking, and the psychological comfort gained is not insignificant. Items such as rice, vegetables, and coal briquettes, which are daily necessities, have all decreased in price this month, which is very beneficial to the livelihood of the common people.

Main Reasons for the Decline

There are several main reasons for the decline in commodity prices this month. Since the outbreak of the European War, prices of all goods have risen sharply. However, the impact on the import market has not been as severe as expected. This is the first reason. Since this month, exchange rates have loosened, and the value of legal tender has become more stable. This is the second reason. Speculators, seeing the unfavorable situation, are eager to sell off their holdings. This is the third reason. The price of rice has fallen, and the prices of various commodities have decreased accordingly. This is the fourth reason.

Decline in Rice and Coal Prices

The decrease in the price of rice is due to the bumper autumn harvest, the arrival of new crops, and the smoother flow of supplies. Second-grade japonica rice fell by 8.58% compared to the previous month, Xiang rice fell by 16.98%, and glutinous rice fell by 3.32%. Among vegetables, green vegetables, radishes, and spinach fell by 20% to 30%. Fresh and salted pork fell by 16.53% and 34.03% respectively. The price of coal briquettes has decreased, firstly because the supply of coal has not been interrupted, secondly because large factories are suppressing prices to compete with small factories, and thirdly because users have sufficient stockpiles and demand is not strong.

Clothing Prices Rise Alone

The prices of all clothing items have increased. Coarse cloth rose by 24.58% compared to the previous month, flannel rose by 19.75%, and bleached cloth rose by 16.59%, showing the most significant increases. As the weather turns cold and winter goods enter the market, coupled with the rising prices of cotton yarn and dyes, the clothing index has trended upwards. The prices of miscellaneous items have also increased, with soap, cigarettes, yellow wine, and sorghum each rising by 5% to 10% compared to the previous month.

People Expect Prices to Fall

According to observers, the European war has reached a stalemate and restrictions have been relaxed, allowing raw materials to be exported. Therefore, commodity prices in Shanghai are unlikely to rise further and may continue to fall this year. Furthermore, various coastal ports have been blockaded, sales to outside areas have stopped, and the purchasing power of Shanghai is weak, making business in the market sluggish. As the end of the year approaches, various industries are focused on maintaining cash flow, and people expect prices to fall. Therefore, a decline in commodity prices in the city is inevitable.

New Base Period: Average for the 25th Year of the Republic (1936) equals 100

### Two Drug Cases

Chen Tianhe and Wang Amao, from Yangzhou, were arrested by the Narcotics Division the day before yesterday for operating a drug den at No. 13, Lane 549, Yu Qiaqing Road, where they provided heroin for people to smoke. Six addicts, Wu Arong, Shen Rongsheng, Wang Jinshi, Tong Rongsheng, Gu Amao, and Wu Fuqing, were also arrested.

The four Chinese were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday afternoon, where Judge Miao Qingbang questioned them and ordered them to be detained for a further hearing on the 18th.

### Burglary in Western Shanghai

At about 10 PM the night before last, the home of farmer Wu Guansheng in Wu Ni Lu Jiaxiang Village, Hongqiao Town, Western Shanghai, was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits speaking the Jiangbei dialect. Armed with knives and clubs, they broke into the house and stole legal tender and clothing worth over 100 yuan. They then broke into the homes of Kunlin, Wu Shengquan, and Wu A'xiang, stealing not only clothing and silver dollars but also over ten quilts and beddings. Fortunately, the villagers sounded the alarm and gathered a crowd, forcing the bandits to flee with their loot.

Wang Jinqing, a local who lives in Wangjiazhai at the intersection of Huobilan Road and Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai and sells fancy clothing, was on his way home from Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday. While passing the entrance of Wangjia Ancestral Hall Lane on Lujia Road, near Columbia Road, he was suddenly ambushed by three bandits who jumped out from the roadside with pistols. They robbed him of the 350 yuan of legal tender he was carrying (including 50 yuan in Central Bank fractional notes) and a wristwatch. The bandits then fled towards Zuo Jiazhai.

Spring and Autumn

### The Movement to Eradicate Flower Games

— Fu Yong

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the "flower games" that had died out have begun to revive. Currently, it is difficult to estimate the number of "listening post" organizations that poison the uninformed masses. Not only are they operating openly in the badlands of special areas, but they have also spread rapidly and secretly to the densely populated concessions. Not long ago, the police uncovered a "listening post" on Belle Road, which is one example.

This is, of course, a serious problem for public safety and society. Although Shanghai is a large metropolis with a relatively high level of culture, the illiterate and ignorant people without knowledge still account for a large proportion of the population. They are all poor people who rely on their own labor to support themselves. Because of their lack of knowledge, they are easily blindly followed; because of the temptation of material things, they are easily fascinated. So they fall into the poisonous net of "playing flower games" again and again. It is truly a case of the more they play, the poorer they become; the poorer they become, the more ruthless they become; and the more ruthless they become, the more they lose everything.

Eradicating these powerful organizations is not an easy task, especially since they have special protection in the badlands. The morbid state of the ignorant people is also a problem. I remember that a few of us young people once enthusiastically tried to persuade people in a small alley on Maite Hesitu Road, but the result was nothing. Many women answered us like this:

"I've already lost half of my family property, why would I be willing not to play?"

We explained the poison of "flower games" to them, and sincerely told them that if they continued to play, they would lose even more. It would be better to turn back and do some other work. They asked us suspiciously:

"Who are you people?..."

If we continued to talk, these ignorant widows would probably get angry at us for "bringing bad luck", so our hope became a bubble—failure!

Seeing the sad faces one by one, I was really sad. I felt sorry for their downfall.

The following are a few methods that I personally thought of to eradicate "flower games". Please give me your wise advice. I am pleading for help on their behalf here!

(1) The police should intensify their work to eradicate "listening posts".

(2) A small number of people who have awakened from their addiction should frankly report the "listening posts" and "sailing boats" they know to the police, so that the police can quickly take action and uncover them.

(3) Because it is not easy to eradicate these organizations from the root, we should also start by persuading the ignorant people. This must be done in an organized and systematic way, otherwise it will be a waste of effort.

(4) At a minimum, every intellectual should check their own family and related surroundings for ignorant people with this bad habit. If there are any, they should be properly advised and persuaded to understand the advantages and disadvantages and the greater good.

I hope everyone will come to save those common people who dream of getting rich! Let's save those whimsical fools! They are so pitiful!

### Banking Circles Hold Children's Health and Intelligence Contests

— Min Wen

Employees in the banking industry are one of the most enviable professions. They work in tall buildings, do things with fixed hours, and can leave the office at four or five o'clock to go home and rest. The income is also quite generous, how can it not make people drool?

Unfortunately, the vast majority of people in the banking industry are small employees, and their living conditions will disappoint you greatly. A monthly salary of twenty or thirty yuan is a lot, and in Shanghai today, where prices are constantly rising, maintaining a family's food and clothing has become a problem. The education and health of children, who are said to be the future masters of China, must be of concern to society.

Recently, the Banking Association held a health competition and an intelligence competition for the children of its members, which will be held simultaneously on the anniversary of the Prime Minister's birth. The Banking Association, as we know, is the only amateur organization in the banking industry, with as many as 7,000 managers, employees, and apprentices. Therefore, this decision to pay attention to the problems of members' children is actually something that people in Shanghai, where life is extremely painful, have probably forgotten.

Their health competition is organized as follows: children or relatives of people in the banking industry can participate for free. The competition items include (1) height and weight (2) complexion (3) skin (4) bone and muscle (5) eyes (6) ears, nose, and throat (7) teeth (8) abdomen (9) reproductive organs (10) prevention. At the same time, they pay attention to the following four items: (1) general condition (happy, lively, agile, and robust) (2) movements (posture of sitting, standing, and walking, and standard movements) (3) speech (4) cleanliness.

The competition is divided into three groups, A, B, and C, according to age. The judging work is entrusted to Dr. Wang Shiwei of the Shanghai Health Association, and judging the results from a medical perspective is the most appropriate thing to do.

The qualifications for participating in the intelligence competition are the same as for the health competition, but the grouping of grades is changed to the school grade level. The competition is divided into four groups, from the first to the fourth grade. The competition items are divided into oral and written tests. All the questions are prepared by Mr. Cheng Weiling of Liben Primary School, so that this children's work is handled in the most open and reasonable way, and the most outstanding children are rewarded with valuable gifts to make them work harder.

Finally, it should be pointed out that Christmas is coming in a month, and once a year, various groups contribute to give a group of stray lambs on the streets some toys, candy, and a happy day. This year, I hope that people in the banking industry will not sit idly by and watch the countless homeless children, and give some grace to them? (Qiao Chou)

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Seventeen: Xi Wai Encourages Reporters, New Territory, Fu Nei, Study of Internal Affairs, Small Stage Show

When Shao Huihua calculated the dates, she went to Hangzhou again. Then, from Jiaxing to Suzhou, she picked up Wu Junsu and went to Shanghai together to attend Jin Danyun's wedding banquet. Her motorcycle was sometimes taken with her and sometimes left at friends' houses, with no fixed arrangement. Weren't these vehicles supposed to be registered? In fact, at that time, there were two types of vehicle registration in China. One type was only valid for use in the city, and the other was valid for use throughout the country. The current vehicle registration offices in China all operate in this way. The registration fee for vehicles only used in the city was very low, but the vehicle could not be driven outside the city. The other type of registration, which was valid for use throughout the country, allowed the vehicle to travel anywhere in the country. The vehicle registration fee for the latter was probably ten times that of the former. This applied to all types of cars, animal-drawn vehicles, motorcycles, rickshaws, and all kinds of vehicles. The Ministry of Transportation in China had a national vehicle registration office, and each province and county also had national vehicle registration sub-offices. By looking at the first character on the registration certificate, one could tell where the vehicle was from and which province and county it was registered in. Shao Huihua's motorcycle was a custom-made women's motorcycle from the United States. In addition to the seat, there was a folding leather pouch attached to the side that could accommodate another person. When not needed, it could be folded up and was barely visible. All kinds of repair tools were included. When Shao Huihua ordered this motorcycle, it cost her 1,500 US dollars, which everyone said was a very good deal. After she had this motorcycle, she could go anywhere. Originally, the highways in China were already accessible in all directions. However, during the Sino-Japanese War, for military reasons, many well-built highways were forcibly destroyed and dug up. Because it was not worth it to let these highways be used by the enemy. But the roadbeds were still there, and the bridges that had been blown up also needed to be rebuilt, but with the foundation in place, it was of course much easier. I don't know if there were more highways after the war than before the war. Moreover, the increase in highways in China was not limited to the post-war period. Even during the war, many were added. For example, many of the highways in the southwest and northwest were built during the war. Therefore, due to the development of highways in China, whether it was a car or a motorcycle like Shao Huihua's, one could travel around the country. Whether it was as far as Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia, one could go. (201)

### Tenants in Garages

— Shu

Editor: In the western district, many garages behind Western-style houses have been rented out. I am one of the garage tenants. When I took refuge in Shanghai, it was the most densely populated time in Shanghai. Being able to rent such a garage to live in was considered very lucky. But I also wondered, after they rented out the garages, where did they park their cars? If the rent collected was used to pay for the rent of parking the car elsewhere, given the value of land in Shanghai today, there wouldn't be much surplus. Besides, sitting in a car is for comfort, isn't it more troublesome now? After living there for a few months, I learned that my landlord had left Shanghai, and the car may have been sold. It was their bookkeeper who rented out the small Western-style house and included the garage in the monthly income. In fact, I had said long ago that it was all the same to have a place to take shelter from the wind and rain, and some of the houses in our hometown were not as well-appointed as the garage! However, when the last hurricane came to Shanghai, there was a problem. It turned out that the garage was built of wooden planks, with mud and lime plastered on the outside. After two days of rain, the mud and lime peeled off, and the rainwater flowed down the wooden planks like tadpoles. Because the terrain was low, there was standing water underneath. If the hurricane had not left Shanghai immediately, the garage would have been a victim of the wind and rain. Of course, I had negotiated with the landlord, and the bookkeeper had promised to repair it. But time passed, and he claimed to have negotiated with the main landlord. Yesterday, it rained all day again, and my residence was leaking above and accumulating below, making it a home on the water. Because I saw that the last negotiation was ineffective, I decided to move. However, I had to speak out: Although it is a garage, the rent is not cheap, and this is a common phenomenon. There is no need to talk about conscience. But the tenant has paid the rent, and the landlord should be responsible for the repairs. Wasn't there a news story in the newspaper the day before yesterday about a collapsed building? It was probably due to years of disrepair, and because it was borrowed by a school, the students jumping and playing led to the tragedy. If another hurricane hits the garage I live in, these temporary wooden planks may be blown away. Raising the rent is just a matter of money, but now they don't care about the lives of the tenants at all.

At the same time, in the past year or so, the landlords in Shanghai have all become very rich. Please don't be short-sighted. We have seen houses that are not very old being demolished in the name of reconstruction in order to raise the rent and drive out the tenants, leading to fights and lawsuits. But why are those houses that are truly in imminent danger left unattended?

Now that winter has arrived, in times of strong winds and heavy snow, who can guarantee that there will be no house collapse tragedies in those garages (and other similarly simply built houses) and houses that have been in disrepair for many years? This is a more serious problem than raising the rent, and I hope people from all walks of life will pay attention to it!

### Letter to the Editor

To the Esteemed Editor: I am writing to you because I work at the Changde Shipping Company's ship radio station and usually don't pay attention to news in the newspapers. However, I heard from a friend that your newspaper published a "Report on Those Taking the Radio Operator Exam" on October 14th. After reading the full text, I found it to be inconsistent with the facts. After checking, I found that "Yihua Foreign Company" had entrusted a neighbor to recruit dozens of radio operators on July 13th of this year to work on the company's ship radio stations. I was ordered to take charge of this matter and carefully selected talent through examinations. Later, due to the outbreak of the European War, the original ships had all shortened their routes, and the company's original plans could not be realized. I deeply regret that I was unable to send the selected personnel to work in the shortest possible time. The claim of recruiting personnel under false pretenses, which is close to fraud, is obviously an excessive statement from those who were not sent to work. This matter concerns my personal reputation. I respectfully request that your newspaper clarify this matter and publish it to correct public opinion and avoid misunderstandings. I would be deeply grateful. (No. 20, Donglinli, Jiaxiyi Road, Jin Shenfu Road) Sincerely, Xi Jicheng (Seal) November 8th.

### US-Educated Playwright Zhang Junxiang Returns to China – Will Give Lectures in Shanghai

The young playwright Zhang Junxiang originally studied at Huaqing University and conducted in-depth research on dramatic theory. His spirit of hard work and dedication is admirable. After graduating from Qinghua University, he participated in the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Examination. Cao Yu, a famous playwright, also participated in the examination that year. As a result, Zhang Junxiang ranked first, while Cao Yu ranked second. Zhang Junxiang was awarded the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship and went to the United States the year before last. He was the first drama student among the Boxer Indemnity scholars. In the United States, Zhang Junxiang was studious and was valued by the American theater community. Due to the outbreak of the war, the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship was suspended, and Zhang had to return to China. He arrived in Shanghai on the 7th of this month and went to the Xuan Palace the night before to watch "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty." He was very surprised to see the play being performed at this time and in this place. It is said that Zhang plans to stay in Shanghai for a few days and may be invited to give a lecture on drama in Shanghai.

### Longing for Love – The Old Maid

— Qi Hua

"This child does not belong to me, because her father does not belong to me!" This sorrowful cry is not only the tragedy of Bette Davis, but also the tragedy of thousands of women deprived of lifelong happiness by feudal society! However, the playwright of "Longing for Love" did not directly attack feudal society. He used a moving story to indirectly stir the hearts of the audience. That final kiss, that painful smile, was not "comfort," but the "end" of this unfortunate woman, just like the English title "The Old Maid." It satirizes not Bette Davis, but the feudal society that made Bette Davis an "old maid" for life.

Having seen Bette Davis in "Dark Victory," her excellent acting skills made it impossible for us to forget that "self-sacrificing" woman. "Longing for Love" will forever make us remember that "pitiful" Charlotte. On the day she was to marry, her sister Delia discovered Clement's illegitimate daughter, Tina. From then on, she was deprived of the happiness of life. Her daughter Tina got married, and she finally dared not tell her that she was her mother. Bette Davis, from girlhood to old age, every scene can stir the audience's emotions, and make the audience move from excitement to sympathy, and then to anger!

Director Edmund Goulding also very delicately analyzes the emotions of the actors on the screen. For example, Delia, Charlotte and Tina's marriages, he can analyze the different emotions of the actors at each level. Especially when Charlotte brings Tina to live at home, when the children are asleep at night, the children say good night to their mother and good night to their aunt, his delicate technique is "truly moving." Tina and Charlotte's relationship, especially the scenes before and after the wedding, are even more lovely. For example, when Lonny sends Tina home, when Charlotte wants to rush out, Delia comes down from upstairs, Delia and Tina go upstairs, two black shadows, from small to large, almost pounce on Bette Davis; Charlotte wants to tell Tina the secret of more than ten years, and finally says good night and comes out; and the final farewell kiss, he fully grasps the emotional expression of each actor.

The liveliness of the camera and the appropriate coordination of music are only minor matters.

### Southern Arts Circle

— Cui Ping

Hu Die's new film "Peerless Beauty" was originally scheduled to start work on the first of this month, but it has been postponed due to insufficient production of costumes and props. Hu has recently been living in seclusion and staying at home all day, silently reciting the script of "Peerless Beauty," trying to figure out the personality of Chen Yuanyuan, the role she plays. Hu said to people: She has not had a new film for more than a year since "Rouge Tears," and she personally believes that she did not perform as well as she wanted in "Rouge Tears." Therefore, she will do her best for "Peerless Beauty" in order to maintain her inherent reputation.

Tang Huaiqiu is working hard to revive the China Travel Troupe, but unfortunately the old team has all been disbanded. Even Tang's biological daughters, Tang Ruoqing and Ruoying, have parted ways with their father, let alone others. Therefore, the revival of the China Travel Troupe is generally considered difficult to be optimistic about. It is heard that Tang intends to recruit new drama talents, give them considerable training, and put them on stage after their performance skills have matured. Therefore, he has invited Hong Kong movie stars to guest star in his newly written play "Children's Situation" for free, in order to use the income to fund the revival of the China Travel Troupe.

Gu Wuwei went to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 30th of last month, carrying two trailers for "Flower of the Earth." This trip is to negotiate the screening of "Flower of the Earth" in Shanghai.

Li Siming, a technical consultant of Hollywood MGM Films, has now arrived in Hong Kong from the United States. Li has a good reputation in Hollywood. He was born in Sydney, Australia, and went to the United States to study five years ago. He was also hired by MGM to serve as a Chinese technical consultant, that is, if there are any Chinese stories to be filmed in the film, opinions will be sought from Li first to avoid repeating the mistakes of humiliating China. Before deciding to return to China, Li also traveled to major cities with many Chinese artists to promote culture. In addition, Li's short film "Rainbow Path," starring in MGM, was also shown at the Queen's Theatre in Hong Kong on the 4th.

Tyrone Power is about to show off his skills in the most "dramatic" film, "The Rains Came." He and Annabella have just returned to the United States from their honeymoon in Europe.

The Sudden Break in Old Male and Old Female Roles

Also, Gong Yunfu, the number one old female role performer, when he was nearly seventy years old, I repeatedly begged him to perform the scene of "Scolding Cao." This old man was unusually energetic that day. After dozens of lines of dialogue, he continued to sing more than ten lines of "Er Liu" "Fast Clapper," and the most wonderful thing was that he suddenly made a sudden break at the word "thief" in "If you want my son to be under your control, you Cao thief, you are daydreaming, you are wasting your efforts." It was truly unusually clever. Furthermore, in "He Jiu One Branch Mountain" "Great Protector of the Country" in those years, every time during "(And sing) Gold-Inlaid Jade, Strike Down (Net Sing) Copper Hammer Smash You Into Powder," he would definitely make a sudden break at the word "hammer." It is rare to see someone using a sudden break while playing a clean role, and Old He actually did it excellently without feeling tired, which is probably impossible without a naturally good voice.

In short, a sudden break is like spicy chicken and twice-cooked pork in Beijing and Sichuan cuisine. In the midst of sourness, sweetness, saltiness, and blandness, it suddenly mixes in a spicy flavor, which indeed makes people feel refreshed. In recent times, female roles have been very popular for a while, and Shanghai people are really tired of listening to charming voices. At the same time, there are few talented people among the male roles, and there is no one with particularly good talent. Those whose singing and pronunciation enter the ear drums are less than one in ten. How can one talk about the sound of a great bell or the deafening sudden break? Duo Kui is uniquely able to meet these conditions and meet these needs, so that the tens of thousands of opera fans on the isolated island can hear this robust new voice in the midst of gentleness, without having to stretch their necks, bend their waists, concentrate their minds, and wrinkle their brows to listen to the subtle Buddhist music. Although it costs two silver dollars, one can still buy several sections of Pi Huang in a satisfying manner. Therefore, Duo Kui's arrival is indeed a shot in the arm for the opera world. (137)
