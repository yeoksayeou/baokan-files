(2) The release of a certain Mr. Yang who was arrested for distributing flags. (3) The return of confiscated flags and leaflets.

### Soviet Union Decides to Aid Outer Mongolia to Resist Japanese Aggression: The Fighting Power of the Outer Mongolian Army Is Exceptionally Strong; Shelling Japanese Positions Across the Khalkhin Gol River; The Japanese Propaganda Claims Soviet Aircraft Dropped Poison Gas Bombs

Moscow: To mark the 15th anniversary of the founding of the "Outer Mongolian Republic," the army newspaper "Red Star" published a special edition, containing various articles. One article stated: "Outer Mongolia covers an area of 1.5 million square kilometers, with a population of 900,000. The Soviet government has no selfish intentions towards Outer Mongolia, so the people of Outer Mongolia regard us as friends and desire our assistance." As for the strength of the Outer Mongolian army, the newspaper did not reveal any surprising news, only stating that Outer Mongolia produces many horses, with an average of two horses per resident, so the army is mainly cavalry. 30% of the cavalry belongs to the People's Revolutionary Party, whose organization resembles the Communist Party. Another 50% of the cavalry are members of the Revolutionary Youth League. In addition, Outer Mongolia's tank and armored vehicle units are actively training and developing rapidly. Outer Mongolia currently has a military school, which has all the departments except for aviation. In short, the combat power of the Outer Mongolian army is exceptionally strong, and the soldiers are extremely resilient and accustomed to fighting in the desert. If Outer Mongolian territory is invaded in the future, the Soviet Union will regard it as its own territory and defend it. This has already been stated by Stalin and Molotov.

Japanese-Soviet Aerial Combat Unfolds

An Eleventh-Day Reuters Dispatch from a Special Correspondent: Today, from an observation point three miles from the Khalkhin Gol River, I witnessed two Soviet air raids. The first one, under a bright blue sky, was an aerial dogfight. There were twenty-four Soviet aircraft, and the number of Japanese aircraft that met them was unclear. As a result, two Soviet aircraft were hit, caught fire, and crashed, while the remaining ones flew back to their base. Shortly after, eighteen more Soviet aircraft appeared in the sky, disregarding heavy anti-aircraft fire, and bombed the Japanese air force's water source. Later, I saw bomb fragments, which, according to the Japanese, were bacteriological bombs. The Soviets intended to use them to poison the water. The Soviet aircraft dropped a total of twenty-five bombs, which the Japanese are now collecting and sending to a chemical laboratory for analysis. Although the Japanese artillery and infantry launched a fierce attack, the Mongolian army is still holding the east bank of the Khalkhin Gol River, refusing to abandon the position which the Japanese claim was originally part of "Manchukuo."

A Tenth-Day Associated Press Dispatch from a Special Correspondent: This afternoon, at 2:00 PM, at a Japanese stronghold five kilometers east of the Khalkh River, I witnessed the air forces of Japan and the Soviet Union engaged in a fierce and desperate battle. According to Japanese reports, sixteen Soviet aircraft have been shot down, while one Japanese aircraft was forced to land. The reporter witnessed both air forces moving northeast, out of sight, and personally saw an aircraft of unknown nationality catch fire and crash, and another aircraft forced to land. According to the Japanese, since 1:00 PM today (Monday), 59 Soviet aircraft have been shot down, and the Japanese forces are now only five kilometers from the Khalkhin Gol River, while the Soviet forces have been forced to retreat behind the river. Furthermore, the Japanese positions in the vicinity were subjected to heavy air raids and artillery fire this afternoon.

Editorial

### Danzig and the European Situation

Mr. Wu Zhuoyu has submitted an article to this newspaper entitled, "Inferring the European Situation from the Danzig Question." This newspaper has repeatedly elaborated on Danzig and the European situation, presenting our views on each stage of its evolution. Mr. Wu, however, starts from the beginning, summarizing the historical and geographical causes and consequences. All this information belongs to the realm of public reality and is by no means a new discovery; but it is something that this newspaper has not previously narrated. We have excerpted Mr. Wu's article for publication, confident that readers will gain insight from it. The Reporter

The current tension in Europe hinges on the dispute between Germany and Poland over the Free City of Danzig. The key to the German-Polish dispute lies in "Danzig." Originally, Danzig was the port of exit for Poland's Vistula River, covering an area of only 754 square miles, with a population of 380,000, mostly Germans. After the European War, the League of Nations entrusted its administration to Poland. Danzig is Poland's only major commercial port on the Baltic Sea, and a major issue that Germany has never forgotten. After Hitler came to power, he signed a ten-year non-aggression pact with Poland, which he recently terminated. On the Polish side, in addition to obtaining the right to operate businesses in Danzig, a corridor was formed between western Germany and East Prussia, providing a vital sea outlet. However, Poland is also aware that the Danzig Free City will inevitably create problems sooner or later. Therefore, a new port, Gdynia, has been built north of Danzig to expand Poland's foreign trade and maintain Poland's sea route, as a landlocked Central European country. Germany is inherently ambitious, especially since Danzig is its former territory. Poland is well aware of Germany's ambitions and remains vigilant at all times; as once Danzig changes hands, the Polish Corridor would become practically useless, and its foreign trade would be on the verge of collapse. Therefore, in order to consolidate industry and commerce, work hard on construction, and invigorate the domestic economy, Poland must maintain Danzig and the corridor, as it concerns the fate of Poland and has no room for retreat. Even if war breaks out as a result, any sacrifice would be made without hesitation. This is why Poland is preparing for war and waiting for the destiny of Danzig.

As for Britain and France, the survival of Poland is of great concern to them, as most people understand. Since Hitler's arrogance was exposed, and after the seizure of Austria and Czechoslovakia, Britain felt that the prestige of the British Empire was under great threat, which is undeniable. Poland is located in the center of Europe, and the only way to achieve permanent peace in Europe is to guarantee Poland's independence. Because Poland borders Germany to the south, it serves as a barrier to Germany's expansion to the northeast; and because Poland is connected to the Soviet Union in the northeast, it acts as a long wall for the Western European countries. Therefore, Britain and France must guarantee Poland first in order to maintain their inherent dignity and prestige. Therefore, Chamberlain's statements on the German-Polish dispute are all very firm. As for France, the relationship between France and Poland is even more closely linked, as recognized by both countries; therefore, in February 1921, France and Poland established a treaty of alliance. For this reason, the actions of Britain, France, and Poland are consistent, and it is natural to expect that Britain and France will not stand idly by if Poland is attacked.

Hitler's style of aggression, both political and military, is demonstrated by the seizure of Austria and Czechoslovakia. Since its restoration, Poland has been acutely aware of its perilous situation. Therefore, Poland has been extremely active in diplomacy over the years. A prominent example is the signing of a treaty of alliance with Romania to prevent Germany from invading from the south; and because of the Ukrainian issue within the country, the Soviet-Polish treaty was signed with the Soviet Union on March 10, 1921. In 1932, a treaty of non-aggression was signed with the Soviet Union. In 1933, in order to solidify its international position and prevent other countries from taking action, Poland signed a definition treaty against aggression with the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Estonia, Latvia, Persia (now Iran), Romania, and Turkey. On one hand, it worked hard on domestic construction and military buildup. At the same time, in order to prevent Germany from starting trouble, Foreign Minister Beck negotiated diplomatic relations with Germany, and finally, on January 26, 1934, the German-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty was established, with a term of ten years. All of this is Poland's consistent policy of being wary and "guarding against thieves" for the past twenty years. As of today, Poland has an army of 1 million people, with reserves of 2 million, and the national population has also increased from 27.18 million to 35 million. Within the country, all industries, whether agricultural, commercial, or industrial, are being improved and developed. Poland has long affirmed that a major European war will break out sooner or later; and the disaster of national subjugation is what Poland has long since experienced.

### Japanese Aircraft Indiscriminately Bombing Chongqing; US Lodges Strong Protest; Attempts to Make Japan Understand US Attitude; Extremely Concerned About Japanese Actions in China

Washington: US State Department officials announced last night that the United States has lodged new, strong protests with Japanese authorities in Tokyo, Washington, and Shanghai, objecting to the continued bombing of Chongqing by the Japanese air force. The lives and property of American nationals there are under threat from Japanese bombs. US Secretary of State Hull personally presented the aforementioned protest to Japanese Ambassador to the US, Horinouchi, yesterday. US Chargé d'Affaires to Tokyo, Dooman, also lodged a protest with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, lodged the same protest with the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai on Saturday. The US protest condemned the Japanese bombing of Chongqing in its entirety, which has threatened the temporary embassy of the US in China and endangered the life of US Ambassador to China, Johnson. Some in diplomatic circles believe that the recent US protests are related to the US efforts to peacefully resolve the Tianjin incident. They believe the US has attempted to make Japan understand that the US continues to be and is extremely concerned about Japanese actions in China. (Eleventh Day Associated Press Dispatch)

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull received Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi today and immediately protested the bombing of American church buildings in Chongqing, China, by Japanese aircraft. At the same time, US Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Dooman, has also lodged the same protest with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. (Tenth Day Havas Dispatch)

### Hong Kong Police Bureau's Stance on Printing Labor Strike

(Hong Kong) The compositors of the Hong Kong Printing Workers Union requested a reduction in working hours and a salary increase from various newspapers on June 29. As of the 10th, this had not been resolved, and a strike was implemented that night. The Newspaper Guild immediately held an emergency meeting and unanimously decided to reject the workers' demands. Compositors from the Ta Kung Pao and Sing Tao Daily did not participate in the strike because they were not members of the union. The National Daily was not affected because it was printed by the Southwest Printing Company, which has always treated its workers well. All other newspapers were unable to publish on the 11th. The Hong Kong Police Bureau is paying close attention to this turmoil and has arrested five key members of the union. (Eleventh Day Dispatch)

### Qingdao Incident: Intense Anti-British Movement; Stones Destroy British Consulate and Seven British Shops

(Qingdao) Yesterday, Japanese and Chinese individuals here held an intense anti-British movement. Demonstrators destroyed the British consulate and seven British shops with stones. The British protection ship "Roseforth" plans to arrive here today to protect the lives and property of British expatriates. The British Consul-General in Qingdao lodged a serious protest with the Japanese authorities last night, stating that he had personally warned the Japanese Consul-General twenty-four hours earlier that he had obtained a plan by the Japanese to instigate an attack on the British Consulate. Britain intends to lodge a similar protest with the Tokyo authorities. According to reports, yesterday morning, in front of Japanese troops and Chinese police, a Chinese mob, mixed with many Japanese in plain clothes, paraded in front of the British Consulate, throwing large stones and firecrackers at the consulate building. Numerous large stones shattered the consulate's windows, scattering broken glass throughout the consulate's offices. The mob used firecrackers to shatter the glass and shouted anti-British slogans. The Japanese guards, who were officially requested by the British to protect the British Consulate, turned a blind eye to the throwing of large stones and firecrackers at the consulate and did not stop them. Although demonstrators were not allowed to enter the British Consulate's premises, the Japanese guards and Chinese police made no attempt to interfere with the attack on the consulate or other British property. Finally, the mob attacked seven British shops, smashing many glass windows with stones. Fortunately, none of the Britons who were attacked were injured, as they had fled to shelter before the glass windows were shattered. Britons walking on the street had already taken refuge before the mob approached. Japanese sources claimed that the demonstrators had been repelled by the Japanese marines and that no British property had been lost, but the British side has denied this claim. According to eyewitnesses, the Japanese marines did not attempt to disperse the demonstrators at the time, only preventing them from entering the British Consulate. Furthermore, after the incident, telegrams sent by foreign journalists were detained by Japanese inspectors and only allowed to pass after fourteen hours. (Eleventh Associated Press Telegram)

(Qingdao) A group of Chinese people resumed an anti-British demonstration parade yesterday afternoon, marching in formation near the British Consulate here, throwing stones and setting off firecrackers, causing minor damage to the British Consulate. These Chinese also attacked two British bank buildings here, smashing doors and windows. Demonstrators distributed many anti-British leaflets during the parade. The police and guards made absolutely no effort to interfere with the marchers. The British Consul-General attaches great importance to this matter and is currently drafting a detailed report to London. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)

(Tokyo) The Japan Masses Party today instructed all provinces, cities, and villages to engage in anti-British movement activities, requesting that the party's branches pass resolutions urging the government to adopt a tough attitude towards Britain. At the same time, leaders within the party are likely to turn small grievances into major hatred, so the anti-British movement has the potential to expand nationwide. From today onwards, the Social Masses Party will also follow the example of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties and adopt a policy of opposing Japan's pro-British stance. The Tokyo People's Anti-British League is scheduled to convene a mass anti-British rally on July 14th, and the Osaka City Council also passed a largely anti-British resolution yesterday.

### Germany Temporarily Watching Danzig After Britain Decides Its Attitude; Key Military and Political Figures Leave Berlin for Vacation; National Socialist Party to Hold Congress in Early September; Hitler Drafting Speech

(Berlin) General von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, began his regular vacation yesterday. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also left for vacation in southern Germany yesterday. Führer Hitler is currently residing at the Berghof villa near Berchtesgaden and does not plan to return to the capital for the time being. Political circles here believe that these facts are sufficient to indicate that the German government does not intend to make the European situation tense in the coming weeks. Regarding the report in the Polish newspapers that the German Parliament will hold a special meeting in the middle of this month and the Führer will deliver an important speech on the Danzig issue, political figures here dismiss it as unfounded and not credible. (Eleventh Haitong Telegram)

(Berlin) Most of the leaders of the German military and political circles have left or will leave Berlin to rest elsewhere. Government agencies are now preparing for vacation. Hitler has gone to Berchtesgaden, where he is reportedly drafting his speech for the annual congress of the National Socialist Party to be held in Nuremberg in early September. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)

Danzig: German munitions are still being shipped from East Prussia into the city. Several German ships arrived here again last night, bringing a large quantity of munitions, mostly hand grenades. After unloading, these munitions have been stored separately in the Schopenhauer Wharf Conservatory, slaughterhouse, and power plant. (Eleventh Havas Telegram)

(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons today, Conservative MP Mrs. Claitzel urged Prime Minister Chamberlain to advise German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to extend the exchange plan agreed upon by Germany and Italy regarding the residents of Tyrol to the city of Danzig and the French protectorate of Tunisia in North Africa. (Note: There are Italian minorities in the German province of Tyrol, and German minorities in the Italian province of Tyrol. The residents of Danzig are mostly of German ethnicity, and there are many Italians in Tunisia.) Foreign Office official Butler immediately replied, "The Foreign Secretary, Halifax, is unable to express an opinion on whether the Tyrol resident exchange plan can be extended to Danzig and Tunisia. A suggestion can only be made after detailed information is received regarding a universal application of the exchange plan. In short, the government will pay attention to all important considerations regarding this matter." (Tenth Havas Telegram)

### Soviet Union Seeks Peace Without Sacrificing Principles; Maisky Delivers Speech

### German and Italian Reactions to Chamberlain's Remarks Differ; British Opinion Unanimously Supports; Part of the French Press Dissatisfied

(Berlin) Political figures here believe that Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on the Danzig issue in the House of Commons yesterday contained nothing new and failed to change the current situation. The general opinion is that "We should pay attention to Chamberlain's statement that both Germany and Poland were misled by unfounded rumors in March of this year and mobilized for no reason. As for Chamberlain's statement that the steps taken by Poland and the guarantees provided by Britain to Poland prove that the Prime Minister's measures are entirely malicious. Chamberlain believes that Danzig has become an international issue, which is a big mistake. The Danzig issue is only related to the citizens of Danzig themselves. The city of Danzig has the full right to determine its own destiny and does not need Britain to overstep its authority." (Eleventh Haitong Telegram)

(Rome) Newspapers here today commented on Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks yesterday, saying that they were another hint of a Munich Conference. Il Popolo di Roma stated that those who expected the Prime Minister's tone to be very stern were bewildered to hear that there could be a better solution to the Danzig tragedy. Il Messaggero stated that the sword that London was brandishing with a threatening attitude has now been carefully sheathed. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)

(London) The Times commented today on Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks on Danzig, stating that the positions of Britain and Germany are now very clear, leaving no room for misunderstanding. In fact, the unconditional annexation of Danzig by Germany would completely overturn the current balance of power and the structure of Europe, which Britain firmly believes, and other countries share this sentiment. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)

(Paris) The newspapers here today welcomed Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks yesterday, but a few commentators expressed concern about the Prime Minister's suggestion that negotiations might be possible between Poland and Germany. Le Peuple stated that Chamberlain clarified Britain's position without leaving any doubt. Le Figaro stated that the Prime Minister's words made it clear what value the Western European powers placed on their commitment to Poland. Le Petit Parisien stated that Chamberlain did not rule out the possibility of a peaceful solution, but this possibility seems very difficult to realize at this time. Le Temps stated that the Prime Minister's remarks regarding the possibility of negotiations were unfortunate, as Germany would only agree to reconcile with Poland after it ceded Danzig. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)

Warsaw: Polish government officials recently declared that Prime Minister Chamberlain's firm statement in the House of Commons yesterday that the British government is determined to fulfill its guarantees to Poland has made Poland "very satisfied." Unofficial sources stated that Chamberlain's speech was firm and clear, and that a firm statement of Britain's attitude is sufficient to prevent the Danzig issue from causing conflict. Although this declaration does not create new elements for the overall situation, it has confirmed the British government's attitude. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)

(New York) American newspapers criticizing Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday mostly said that they were a boundary stone on the road from Munich to Danzig. The New York Times stated that the position on the Vistula River is the last point of victorious resistance to military domination. There are two reasons why this position should be taken now: one is that Hitler is currently showing signs of hesitation, and the other is that if Britain and France do not provide assistance while the Anglo-Soviet stalemate continues, it is tantamount to inviting Hitler to move forward. Lippmann, a famous political commentator who has just returned to the United States from Europe, published an article in the New York Herald Tribune, stating that the situation has now reached the point where if the Axis powers want to achieve further significant conquests, it will inevitably lead to a full-scale war.

### 150 British Bombers Practice Flying in French Airspace; Air Force Totals Around 1,000 Soldiers; France to Also Send Aircraft to Britain for Training

(London) According to news from the British Air Ministry, British military aircraft began practicing in French airspace today. There are twelve squadrons participating, with a total of more than 150 aircraft, mostly medium and heavy bombers. All British military aircraft only soared in the sky after entering French territory and never landed. Each aircraft carries a sealed secret order that can only be opened after flying out of British territory. The British Air Ministry stated that the territory of the British mainland is not large enough for high-speed aircraft, and it is difficult to fully utilize their capabilities if they are limited to flying within the airspace. Furthermore, British aircraft pilots lack the opportunity to practice flying in foreign airspace, so flying to French airspace will definitely be beneficial. It is self-evident that the scale of participation in this decision is around 1,000 people. The French Air Ministry has agreed to provide all assistance and has indicated that it will send an aircraft squadron to British airspace for training. (Eleventh Haitong Telegram)

(London) The Aviation Department, in order to actively train Air Force pilots, has dispatched twelve squadrons of bombers, totaling 150 aircraft, to France today with the consent of the French government for exercises. This is the first time that France has allowed the air force of another country to fly in its airspace during peacetime. It is reported that the bombers will fly to France via two routes. Several squadrons of heavy bombers plan to fly non-stop to the port of Bordeaux and then return, a total distance of 1,200 miles. The remaining squadrons are medium-sized bombers and will fly to the city of Le Mans via the northern city of Orleans and then return to the country, their routes forming a triangle. The aircraft are fully equipped, each carrying three to five pilots, and flying at an altitude of 6,000 feet. When passing through major cities, they will descend to 1,000 feet. The heavy bombers will fly in French airspace for up to five hours. (Eleventh Havas Telegram)

### Germany Seeks Early Completion of Large-Scale Public Works; Orders General Mobilization of Ordinary People; Male Employees Fully Conscripted

(Berlin) Government authorities, in order to complete large-scale public works to promote "national interests," are actively promoting the "General Mobilization of Ordinary People" plan throughout the country. Many male employees of public and private institutions have been conscripted. After a medical examination, they are assigned to various local areas to build military projects, construct roads, and build a large station in Tempelhof Town near here. The vacancies left behind are to be filled as much as possible by female employees. Originally, the employees hired by small-scale shops in Germany already felt insufficient. Now, since the implementation of the "General Mobilization of Ordinary People" plan, it has become even more difficult to transfer them. All industries are affected, and it is said that the number of barbers who have been conscripted is the highest, accounting for 75% of the total. Many waiters in hotels and cafes have also been conscripted. As for workers in the transportation industry, their physical fitness is known to be strong, and they will be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort in various tasks. The government authorities have reportedly decided to conscript them all. In addition, government authorities have issued orders to the National Socialist Youth League, the Labor Front, and personnel from other National Socialist Party organizations, university students, and army soldiers to participate in wheat harvesting work.

### Aftermath of Spanish Civil War; Armory Suddenly Explodes; Over 100 Dead and 1,500 Injured; Small Village Reduced to Rubble

The village of Villagarcía de la Mota, 25 miles from Salamanca, was completely destroyed last night due to an armory accident, killing 60 people and injuring 1,500. This is the most tragic armory accident in Spanish history. It is said that the explosives were stored in a place with excessive heat. In addition to the known casualties, 80 people are still missing and may have been killed. The village, which used to be a peaceful area, has been reduced to rubble since the disaster last night, with no house intact. Although fire brigades from neighboring villages came to the rescue, they were helpless due to lack of water. The general displaced population, with the relief of charitable organizations, is currently residing temporarily in Salamanca. When the gunpowder exploded, a freight train stopped in front of the station was also blown to pieces, showing the ferocity of the explosion. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)

Madrid: Regarding the armory explosion in the village of Villagarcía de la Mota, it has been confirmed that more than 150 people were killed and more than 1,500 injured, with losses amounting to millions of pesetas. 1,100 of the village's 1,300 buildings have been destroyed.

### US Neutrality Law Amendment Issue; Affects Entire Foreign Policy; Isolationist Forces in Congress Growing Stronger; Roosevelt Prepares to Exert Full Effort to Fight

(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to study the Neutrality Law issue in order to decide whether to submit the Bloom Bill with the Willis Amendment attached (Note: The Willis Amendment stipulates the maintenance of the arms embargo clause) to the Senate for discussion, or to choose another one among various proposals. The State Department and political figures are currently silent. However, among the 96 members of the Senate, 34 have agreed to oppose any suggestions that the current government may put forward, and are vehemently opposed to the abolition of the arms embargo clause. When the Senate discussed the bill to extend the President's monetary and financial powers some time ago, only 6 senators used delaying tactics, and the bill was not passed in time. Now that there are 34 opponents, it is feared that it will not be easy for the Neutrality Law issue to reach a decision during the current session of Congress. In addition, the government forces in the Foreign Relations Committee are only on par with the opposition. If the committee cannot reach a clear conclusion at its meeting tomorrow, the government's proposal to submit the Neutrality Law issue to the Senate for discussion may be temporarily abandoned. In recent days, the Neutrality Law issue has taken on political significance, unlike when the House of Representatives began discussing it. The issue of whether to retain or abolish the arms embargo clause was originally the crux of the matter, but in the view of most congressmen, this point has receded to a secondary position and will not seriously affect the attitude of the United States after a war occurs in the future. The current situation has actually evolved into a dispute between President Roosevelt and Congress over the entire foreign policy. The President's current foreign policy is to work for the maintenance of world peace. Although its outline has won the support of the majority of public opinion, there is no shortage of congressional representatives who oppose it, saying that everything that hinders the complete independence and absolute neutrality of the United States is what the people urgently want to avoid. Therefore, President Roosevelt may depart early to tour the Pacific coast states and deliver several speeches along the way to defend the current foreign policy. (Tenth Havas Telegram)

(Washington) Bloom, the drafter of the Bloom Neutrality Law, declared today that the government still hopes to have the bill voted on in the Senate. Bloom spoke before having a long conversation with Roosevelt. Bloom said that the embargo provisions adopted by the House are fundamentally not a "Neutrality Law." (Note: The Bloom Bill proposes to remove the arms embargo item from the Neutrality Law.) (Eleventh Associated Press Telegram)

He also served as one of the American representatives at the World Economic Conference held in London in 1933. (Eleventh Havas Telegram)

(New York) According to a dispatch from Washington, the Navy Department is preparing to request Congress to appropriate funds to build two battleships of 45,000 tons each. Naval experts believe that the six battleships currently under construction, each of 35,000 tons, are insufficient to meet needs. Therefore, they are requesting the construction of two 45,000-ton battleships, at a cost of approximately $100 million. (Haitong Telegram, 11th)

### British Export Credit Loans to China: Trade Minister Answers Member of Parliament's Question

(London) Labour MP Belcher today inquired in the House of Commons about the value of applications from British merchants regarding exports to China in pounds sterling over the past six months, and also inquired about the extent of approved applications, and the total amount of guarantees given by the Export Credits Guarantee Department during these six months. Hudson, the Minister for Overseas Trade, replied that the total amount of contracts and guarantees issued in the six months ending at the end of June was £30,365,207. As for the figures for any particular country, they have never been published as a matter of practice. Belcher also asked whether the amount guaranteed by the Overseas Trade Department was less than £200,000, and if so, whether the reason was a lack of initiative on the part of British merchants or a fault of the Overseas Trade Department. Hudson declined to answer this question in detail, as the department has always regarded information related to various transactions as confidential and does not make it public.

### Tientsin Situation Tenses Again: Japan Attempts to Block the Hai River; Tashiro Says Both Tientsin Concessions Will Be Blockaded Long-Term; Japanese Foreign and Army Ministries Have Agreed on Absolute Conditions; Spear's Military Trial Causes Deep Anxiety in Britain

(Tientsin) After a few days of calm here, two incidents occurred again this morning: (1) The British resident, Howorth, who was previously subjected to the humiliation of a strip search, entered the British Concession this morning with three other British people. The others were not inconvenienced and were allowed to pass, but Howorth was again ordered by the Japanese to take off his shoes and socks for detailed inspection, and then ordered to take off his trousers for a thorough search, before being allowed to enter the British Concession. (2) At 9:00 a.m. this morning, a Chinese sampan carrying many passengers from the Third Special District arrived at the British Concession. The passengers immediately dispersed, leaving only the boatman on board. A few minutes later, several armed Chinese and Japanese police officers arrived at the British Concession in a small boat, docked by the river. Two Chinese police officers then went ashore, intending to take the boatman away. The British police explained to them the reasons why they could not allow them to arrest the boatman, and asked them to go to the British police station, guaranteeing that if the procedures were proper, the British police authorities would consider it themselves. The two Chinese police officers then returned to the boat and reported the situation to the Japanese. Shortly afterwards, the boat left and nothing more was heard. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)

(Tientsin) On the eve of the upcoming Tokyo-Tientsin talks, the Japanese here seem to be attempting to blockade the Hai River. According to a Japanese military spokesman, the terrorists in the British and French Concessions of Tientsin have recently been traveling to Shanghai and Hong Kong on foreign ships. Therefore, the Japanese side intends to impose stricter control on ship traffic. In addition, several incidents have occurred in the past few days, so the Japanese side may blockade the Hai River. Furthermore, the Japanese military spokesman did not mention a word about the shooting of a Chinese sailor yesterday. In addition, the Japanese sentries' searches of British people have become even stricter. A British resident named Howorth was even searched for his tie and leather shoes at the intersection of Shansi Road. (Associated Press Telegram, 11th)

(Tokyo) The Foreign and Army Ministries have now agreed on the policies to be adopted in the Tokyo-British-Japanese conference. It is expected that talks on the Tientsin situation can begin before July 17. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)

(London) Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the military attaché of the British Embassy in China, has been detained by the Japanese military for a month and a half. It is said that he will be tried by a Japanese military court in the near future. People in the Foreign Office here are deeply concerned about this. Regarding this matter, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita had promised British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie that he would do his best to ensure the early release of Lieutenant Colonel Spear. The British government authorities are now waiting quietly for Ambassador Craigie to submit a report, and then decide on how to respond. (Havas Telegram, 10th)

(Berlin) According to the German semi-official news agency DNB today, Japanese Consul Tashiro in Tientsin said that Japan is prepared to blockade the British and French Concessions in Tientsin for up to eleven years in order to force Britain and France to reflect. According to the news agency, since the Japanese side blockaded the British and French Concessions in Tientsin, many shops and banks other than British merchants have moved out of the British Concession, so the blockade has been very successful. (Associated Press Telegram, 11th)

(Peiping) A Japanese military spokesman replied today regarding the Japanese side's establishment of a special military court to try its own soldiers, that it can also try Spear. As for when Spear will be tried or what crimes Spear is accused of, he could not say. The court trying Spear is a special organization established after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and has always been used to try Japanese soldiers, civilians, and foreigners who violate military law. The organization of this special court is not composed of military officers, but of legal scholars and other civilians accompanying the army. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)

(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun reported that the Army Ministry and the Foreign Ministry formally met yesterday afternoon and agreed on the absolute conditions for the British-Japanese conference to be held in Tokyo, which is for Britain to abandon its pro-Chiang policy. The British-Japanese conference will begin this week, but it is not yet certain. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)

### Chinese Army Controls Chaoan: Fierce Fighting on Both Banks of the Tuo River; All Japanese Forces Encounter Strong Resistance; Chinese Reinforcements Arrive Continuously

Shantou Correspondence: The number of Japanese troops in Shantou is decreasing daily. Japanese warships and aircraft carriers outside the port left Shantou for Fujian on the 3rd. There are two gunboats, two transport ships, three shallow-draft ships, and fifteen or sixteen motorboats in the port, plus rubber boats, armed fishing boats, and small steamships captured in Shantou, totaling over 100 ships. They carry troops and move around every day, sailing from the Xiangzi Bridge in Chaoan, down to Chenghai, around the Huidong Bridge in Shantou, and into the Pengzhou Wharf, Guanbu, and forts on the Tuo River. The Japanese troop movements are very erratic, sometimes advancing towards Fengxi, Fuyang, and Anjie Road. The Chinese forces there, led by the Hua Zhenzhong Brigade, are holding strongholds in Sangpu Mountain, Wuyang Mountain, Guanji, Dajiao, and Jinshi. The Japanese troops moving south from Chaoan have consistently failed to break through both the Chao-Shan Railway and the An-Jie Road lines. Currently, the Japanese troops still rely on steamships to travel back and forth on the Han River tributaries. As for Yunbu, Longhu, and Meixitou, three locations along the Huti Road Zhong Station, they were recaptured by the Chinese army on July 1. On June 30, Japanese motorboats concentrated at the Xiangzi Bridge and attacked Caijiayuan and Dongjin, attempting to attack Chen's position on Han Mountain. All three advances were repelled because there are many bamboo forests on the riverbank, and the Chinese army is hiding in the bamboo forests to protect Han Mountain. Although the city of Chaoan has been abandoned, it is still under the control of the Chinese bamboo pole mountain artillery. The two sides are in a stalemate. In the past, there were five battles for mountain positions, such as Anbu Panlong Mountain, Guanxi Wuyang Mountain, Fengshan below Longhu, Hulu in West Lake of Chao City, and Qingmao Mountain near Fuyang. With the help of Japanese aircraft, heavy artillery formed a fire net to attack, but they still could not cross and suffered unexpected damage. Therefore, the Japanese troops who attacked Jieyang changed their route to advance northward along the Tuo River front. From the 26th, they continuously moved troops from Chaoan to attack Fort Guanbu. The Japanese troops are too few, with only two full regiments (8,000 men). They are composed of various types of troops. The attack on Jieyang began fiercely on June 28. Along the Tuo River tributaries, they used rubber boats to carry troops to advance to Fengkou Quxi. There were ambushes by soldiers and civilians on the shore, intercepting them everywhere, sinking 16 steamships and rubber boats. Because this tributary originates from Jiaomen in Chaoan, drawing Han River water into the Tuo River, the water flow is rapid. The Chinese had previously laid obstacles at the bends of the creek. When the motorboats traveled upstream during high tide, they were blocked by broken boats on the riverbed. With a slight delay, artillery shells from the shore would fly over. The first batch of Japanese soldiers attacking Jieyang was defeated by the Chinese army. Fortunately, shallow-draft gunboats provided artillery cover, and they retreated from Fort City to Guanbu on the morning of the 29th. On the 30th, the White Army attacking Jieyang changed its route from Sangyuan and Xilu to enter Guanbu, forcing Chaoyang Guiyu Chendian, with the intention of entering Puning Liusha, and instead invading Mianhu of Jieyang. The two armies are fiercely fighting at Fort Quxi on the Tuo River front, and Chinese reinforcements are arriving continuously. The Japanese troops have been running east and west, and transferring north and south since the war began on the 21st, sometimes Chenghai, sometimes Guanbu, and it is still the Masaki Detachment, without any new reinforcements.

### Japanese Troops in Jiading Relocated: Ambushed by Chinese Troops En Route

Baoshan Correspondence: After reorganization, the guerrilla force led by Lu Axiang of the Chinese side in Shishan once rushed into the county seat of Baoshan. A few days ago, more than 300 Japanese troops from Jiading and other places, riding in more than a dozen tanks, traveled from Xiaochawusha to Shihdongkou, planning to take a ship from there to relocate to other places. An advance unit of 45 people was suddenly surrounded by Lu's troops on all sides near Xiaochawusha, and the entire unit was wiped out. By the time the main force of the Japanese arrived, the Chinese army had already dispersed.

### Shantou is Desolate: Exports and Imports Blocked; The Whole City is Dark; Postal and Telegraph Services Cut Off

Shantou Correspondence: The China Merchants Bureau Wharf in Shantou, as well as the Taikoo, Jardine, and Chaojie Ferry Wharves on the West Embankment, have all been occupied by the Japanese army for the transportation of military supplies. Pedestrians are not allowed to pass through the troop areas on the Outer Ma Road. The West Embankment, where the military transport and unloading points are located, and all street entrances are surrounded by barbed wire. The offices and warehouses of various foreign firms are surrounded so that not a drop of water can leak through. A notice from the "Shantou Local Maintenance Committee Preparatory Committee" is posted on Yongping Building, signed by "Chairman" Chen Juemin and "Deputy" Yang Jixiang. The old site of the Guangdong Bank, opposite Yongping Building, has been changed to the Japanese Consulate. The Consul General, Takaido Suehiko, and the Deputy Consul, Matsudaira Tadahisa, work there. On the 26th, the British Consul in Shantou and Captain Scott of the British warship HMS Scout visited the building to meet Matsudaira to negotiate the entry and unloading of passengers and cargo by foreign ships, but Matsudaira refused. He only allowed one British ship to enter Shantou each week to carry mail and food to supply foreign residents in Shantou. Other ships, such as those of the Jardine Matheson Line, are not allowed to enter. The British Consul, seeing that the negotiation was ineffective, telegraphed his superiors for instructions. HMS Scout went to Hong Kong on the 28th to meet with Admiral Noble, the Commander-in-Chief, Far East, who had returned to Hong Kong from Singapore, to request instructions on future escort methods. At this time, ships returning to Shantou from Singapore, Siam, and Annam did not enter, but instead went to Hong Kong to unload passengers and cargo. It is said that the price of a large cabin ticket from Hong Kong to Singapore has risen to 250 Hong Kong dollars per ticket. At this time, demand exceeds supply, and it is not easy to buy even if you are willing to pay a high price. Other British ships that usually travel along the coast of South China, such as the Xinhai Gate, Haicheng, Haitan, and Haiyang, docked near the Ludouzhow Lighthouse outside Mayu when passing through Shantou. Before June 26, several ships had entered under the protection of British warships, stopped for four hours and then sailed out, knowing that they could not load or unload passengers or cargo, but they were unwilling to give up the navigation rights of the treaty port, even if they came and went empty. Until recently, no British ships have been seen sailing in again, only British warships dispatching motorboats to pick up Hong Kong mail and deliver it to the British Consulate, which then forwards it to various foreign residents. If British warships were not willing to perform their duties, news between Shantou and the outside world would be completely blocked, with no water leaking through. The city of Shantou is extremely desolate. There are no electric lights or street lights, and there is no postal or telegraph service. The fresh water that is needed every day cannot be obtained. The machinery of the electric light factory was blown into scrap iron on the 21st. The water tower on Zhongma Road was blown down, and the tap water factory at Meixitou was destroyed by artillery fire. At least 20,000 to 30,000 merchants and residents who have not evacuated Shantou still remain. At this time, it is impossible to walk out. There are no boats to pass through to Guanshi or Chenghai. As for the source of fresh water, it is taken from the small river in Zhongshan Park or the Qi Lu well, which has some salty taste. Coolies carry it into the city and sell it along the streets, tasting it first before buying it, at three or four jiao of silver dollars per load. Vegetables, fish, and meat are out of stock. In the villages and stockades outside the city, strong men are guarding the gates, not allowing strangers to approach, and not interacting with Shantou City. Guanshi and Shantou, separated only by a stretch of water, are gazing at each other from afar, becoming a fairy island that can be seen but not reached. Neither side can fly across. The fighting is extremely fierce in Chaojie. The key points along the Chao-Shan Railway are fighting bitterly. The Japanese troops who landed in Dahao have been attacked several times and suffered heavy losses. They are now retreating to Donghu Aotou, building positions based on the terrain, and dare not extend into Guanshi. The Japanese troops who landed at Fort Guanbu were heavily attacked by the Chinese army on July 1. The Japanese troops in Chaoshan number at most 10,000 men. The largest strongholds, such as Shantou, have only 300 to 500 guards. All the foreign residents in Shantou are unwilling to leave. The prosperity of Shantou in the past depended entirely on Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, as almost everyone knows. Now that transportation between Hong Kong and Shantou has been cut off, it has almost become a dead city.

### Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government Poisons the People: Establishes a Charitable Hall to Specially Sell Opium

Suzhou Correspondence: The puppet Jiangsu provincial government is poisoning the people in the occupied areas. It originally set up a so-called "Opium Prohibition Bureau" to issue permits and openly allow smoking. Now, the puppet side has changed its methods and set up a separate "Local Opium Addiction Bureau," starting with Suzhou City. It has selected the west entrance of Nanxianzi Alley as the location of the bureau. The puppet bureau chief, Yang Qincheng, will abolish the former "Raw Opium Shops" and set up a "Hongji Charitable Hall" to specially sell opium. "Raw Opium Shops" will be renamed "Retail Shops," and each shop must pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan and a monthly permit fee of 50 yuan. "Selling and Smoking Places" are called "Rehabilitation Places," and the monthly permit fee is 30 yuan, divided into three grades: A, B, and C. Offices are set up in Wuxi and Wujin counties, divided into grades A and B, specializing in the promotion of opium. All smokers must also re-register, with grade A costing 5 yuan per quarter, allowing them to smoke freely at home. Grade B costs 3 yuan per quarter, and they are only allowed to go to "Rehabilitation Places" to smoke with a permit. The whimsical ideas of the puppet side are evident.

### Chen Lifu Tells Haitong News Agency: China Strives for Education; More Than Half of Schools Destroyed; Rebuilding in the Inland Provinces

(Chongqing, Haitong News Agency, 11th) Chen Lifu, the Minister of Education of China, met with Mr. Mezze, the Far East General Manager of Haitong News Agency, yesterday and made a statement, declaring that more than half of China's universities and other schools have been destroyed in this decisive battle, but they are now being rebuilt in the inland provinces. All facilities are being expanded rapidly. Fortunately, the valuable books in the libraries of Wuhan and Central Universities have been preserved, but the loss of laboratory equipment is great. Among them, the scientific equipment of Tongji University, which was jointly run by China and Germany, has been completely lost. Chen continued to say that previously, China's academic institutions were only concentrated in some coastal areas, but now efforts are being made to distribute them throughout the country. However, due to the difficulty of construction funding, progress is quite difficult. The government has decided to keep some universities in the interior even after the war ends, so that the people in the interior have equal opportunities to learn. Because engineers and scientists will be urgently needed for post-war construction, it is hoped that foreign German scientists will be allowed to come to China to teach in order to promote China's construction work. Chen praised Germany's scholarship for Chinese students, saying that it has been of great benefit to Chinese students in their studies. Chen stated that this war is an excellent education for China, proving what is truly needed and what is still lacking.

Now, it is actively improving according to this result in order to adapt to future needs. Chen continued to discuss the importance of mass education, saying that schools are the focus of political training in nearby areas. In addition, mobile lecture teams traveling across the country by car and boat, as well as films, phonograph records, and broadcast speeches, are used to improve the educational level of the general public. Finally, Chen expressed the hope that China and Germany will continue to cooperate culturally, sending German teachers to China to assist in cultural undertakings, so as to promote the welfare of the two countries.

The school's student production movement uses spare time to manufacture children's toys, and the proceeds are used as contributions to save the country. The number of students in the school's affiliated primary school and kindergarten has increased. Recently, it plans to raise funds to build a new school building in order to accommodate poor and war-torn children from the war zone in Sichuan.

Huaying Girls' High School has merged its senior and junior high schools this term, personnel have been adjusted, and all facilities have been completely renewed. There are 230 students in the whole school, including more than 30 visiting students, mostly from various war zones or nearby war zones. In addition to focusing on classroom teaching, the school has achieved many results in providing extracurricular knowledge and various activities, such as donating money to comfort the soldiers on the front line and sewing winter clothes. Principal Yang Shaoquan of Huaxi Xiehe High School has been in office for 25 years and is full sixty years old. The school presented him with a retirement fee of 3,000 yuan, and Huada hired him as an honorary director. Wu Xianyou has been publicly elected to act as the principal. The school believes that the number of students in the English and mathematics classes is large, and the teachers cannot supervise the students' writing practice. This term, the English and mathematics classes have been separated in order for the teachers to focus their energy. The implementation of the tutor system is also being carried out with great effort.

The private Huamei Girls' High School has been established for 40 years. Since the war, the number of students from the war zone in Sichuan has increased, and classes have been added, increasing to more than 200 students. Because the school buildings are insufficient, it has negotiated with the board of directors to raise funds to expand the school buildings. This year's summer vacation, classrooms will be added and student dormitories will be purchased. The classroom has been completed, and the dormitory is under construction. This term, the school is divided into nine classes, with 280 students. Students transferred from the war zone account for one-third. The special matters that are particularly emphasized this term are (1) improving moral education and piloting the tutor system, (2) paying special attention to student health, (3) paying attention to scout training, (4) student extracurricular activities, and (5) conducting special education training.

### New Remittance Drafts Circulate in the Market - Overall Financial Situation Stabilized - Bank Deposit and Withdrawal Panic Subsides - Increased Capital Enables Banks to Resume Lending

Since the Ministry of Finance's telegram restricting deposits and withdrawals, speculative transactions in the Shanghai market have been curtailed and sharply reduced. The banking and money industries have implemented new remittance drafts, adjusted old remittance drafts, and increased the circulation of capital in the market. Therefore, as the 28th year began, the overall financial situation has stabilized. The various situations are described in detail below.

Restriction of Deposit and Withdrawal Panic Subsides

After the Ministry of Finance's telegram arrived in Shanghai, the banking and money industries unanimously complied with the implementation of deposit and withdrawal restrictions. Depositors and speculators who did not understand the truth rushed to withdraw deposits from various banks. Therefore, the deposit and withdrawal panic in Chinese banks continued to occur. Although the limit was 500 yuan per household per week, the cumulative amount was considerable. Since the banks and money houses reopened after the half-year settlement holiday, the market sentiment has gradually stabilized. Daily payments by various banks have been able to balance out, and some banks and money houses have even experienced more deposits than payments. Therefore, the deposit and withdrawal panic has subsided.

Increased Circulation of Capital in the Market

The new remittance draft system implemented by the banking and money industries has been circulating in the market since the banks and money houses began to receive them from the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks on the 4th of this month. Although the total amount is temporarily set at 50 million yuan, the full amount has not yet been received, and the capital position is quite abundant. At the same time, the 22 million yuan in old remittance drafts deposited by the banks and money houses in the Joint Reserve Treasury of the banking and money industries has also been converted by the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks into legal currency current accounts. Starting in April, the banks and money houses will receive legal currency to meet depositors' withdrawals. The market capital has become much more active after this adjustment.

Contraction of Cash and Reduced Speculation

In order to prevent capital outflow and stabilize the Shanghai financial market, the Ministry of Finance has specifically stipulated deposit payment methods, implemented deposit and withdrawal restrictions, contracted the cash in the market, and eliminated speculation such as absorbing legal currency and purchasing foreign exchange. Since its implementation, it has achieved considerable results. The foreign exchange, cash, cotton yarn, and bean and rice markets have all suffered from a lack of cash, soaring remittance discounts, and speculators have been unable to do as they pleased as before. Although it has not been possible to completely eliminate speculative activities, transactions have been sharply reduced.

Overall Financial Situation Tends to Stabilize

Since the foreign exchange fluctuations, followed by the Ministry of Finance's deposit and withdrawal restrictions, the Shanghai financial market suddenly turned tight, and credit transactions stagnated. Subsequently, the banking and money industries discussed and decided on measures to stabilize the market, adjust remittance drafts and bills, implement the new remittance draft system, increase the circulation of capital, adjust interbank funds, and assist industry and commerce. Although the time has been short since its implementation, the overall financial situation has tended to stabilize. Various banks and money houses have also resumed mortgage credit and various loans to industry and commerce, and are accepting applications within the possible scope.

Bill Exchange Time Changed

Since the concentration of bill exchange by the banking and money industries on July 4, the time for banks to receive bills from money houses was too late, causing various difficulties in the work. Pei Yunqing, a leader in the money industry, once proposed improvements and suggested to the guild. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency inquired from the banking and money industries yesterday and learned that the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks and the Joint Reserve Treasury of the money industry had agreed and announced yesterday that it would be implemented from the 12th. The announcement is recorded below. "Respectfully inform you that since this treasury joined the bill exchange in a entrusted manner, the time for banks to receive bills from money houses has been too late, causing various difficulties in the work. It has now been agreed by the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks to move the bill exchange time forward by half an hour (3:00 PM) starting from the 12th of this month. Afterwards, all bank bills from various houses should also be delivered to this treasury half an hour earlier (2:00 PM). After 2:00 PM, please pay directly to the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks. The time for the association to receive bills is limited to 2:30 PM. A corresponding letter is sent to you, hoping that you will follow the instructions."

### Chinese Guerrillas Attack Tianshenggang

In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, domestic port shipping is freely controlled by the Japanese, and after increasing the number of ships sailing to various ports, the guerrillas in various ports have been appearing and attacking unpredictably, posing a significant blow. According to a reporter from Xinxin News Agency, on the evening of the 9th, a Chinese mobile force suddenly attacked Tianshenggang, burning down the local tax revenue office. After completing the mission, they withdrew. The ship schedule has now been suspended.

### Hozdeng City Ship Loses, Returns to Shanghai From Danger - Master Mariner Steadfast and Outstanding - Refuses Japanese Rescue

The Chinese-language Shanghai newspaper North-China Daily News reports that the ten-thousand-ton motor ship Hozdeng City, after running aground on Jeju Island in heavy fog last week, has now entered the dry dock of the Yangshupu Wharf. The bottom below the waterline has been severely damaged. The ship left Shanghai on July 3 for L興 (transliteration) in northern Korea to transport beans to the UK. While sailing near Jeju Island off the southern coast of Korea, it suddenly encountered dense fog and ran aground. A Japanese surveyor on the island immediately boarded the ship, intending to provide assistance. However, the Master Mariner of the Hozdeng City refused all rescue suggestions, stating that he would use the ship's own power to refloat it. Although the surveyor stated that this was impossible, the Master Mariner insisted and eventually succeeded in refloating the ship and sailing it to Shanghai. The weather was clear all the way, and it arrived in Shanghai without any further misfortunes. It has not yet been decided whether the ship will be repaired here. This matter will be decided by insurers in London. The ship was built in 1924 and belongs to William Reardon Smith & Sons, Ltd. of Cardiff, UK.

### Three British Factories Along the Riverbank Are Cut Off by the Japanese Army - Barbed Wire Fences Erected Along the Suzhou Creek Disrupting Traffic - British Consulate Lodges Protest with the Japanese

The Chinese-language Shanghai newspaper North-China Daily News reports that after the three British commercial factories located along the north bank of the Suzhou Creek in Kaibei were cut off by the erection of barbed wire fences by the Japanese military authorities yesterday (the 10th), the British Consulate has lodged a protest, opposing the Japanese ban on anyone reaching the riverbank wharves of the three factories. After the Japanese took this action, Liaison Officer Hunter immediately began negotiations, stating that this action would cause difficulties, as the trade of the three factories mostly originated from the wharves along the river, and now the wharves were blocked by barbed wire fences. The three factories are the China General Edison Company, as well as the Chongxin and Zhentai cotton mills, all of which are British-owned. The three companies complained to the British authorities yesterday about the Japanese action, stating that unless the obstacles were removed, their trade would suffer significant losses as a result, as their trade relied heavily on the Suzhou Creek. The China General Edison Company, which manufactures heavy items such as trams, was the most affected by the Japanese action. All of the company's manufactured goods were loaded onto boats at the Suzhou Creek wharf, and the employees of the three companies also took sampans from the Public Concession across the river to enter the factory. As a result of this Japanese action, the only channel into the three factories was through a bridge guarded by Japanese soldiers. The cotton mill employees, mostly women, would strongly object to crossing the bridge to enter the factory, as those crossing the bridge were all subjected to Japanese soldier inspections. According to the Japanese military authorities, erecting barbed wire fences to cut off the cotton mills was part of a general plan to isolate the entire north bank of the Suzhou Creek with barbed wire fences in order to prevent undesirable elements from sneaking into the western district of the Public Concession. According to the Japanese, these undesirable elements crossed the river to enter. The Japanese also stated that there was absolutely no question of discrimination because the three factories were British-owned, but that the isolation was due to the fact that these properties were located on the north bank of the river. The China General Edison Company and the Chongxin Cotton Mill are currently in operation, but the Zhentai Cotton Mill has not yet started operations because the Japanese did not recognize its British ownership and prevented it from resuming work after the Shanghai war. After lengthy negotiations, the Zhentai Cotton Mill was handed over to its original owner in May and left under the care of people, and its machinery and buildings have been repaired in preparation for starting operations. The three factories all face the Italian military defense zone on the outer roads of the western district of the Public Concession.

### World Baptist Alliance - Joint Assembly - Held in Atlanta, USA - Chinese Representatives Have Been Designated

It is learned that this year is the year for the assembly, which is scheduled to be held in Atlanta, USA, from July 22 to 29. The China Baptist Council has officially designated Reverend Wu Jizhong, General Secretary of the Jiangsu Baptist Convention, to attend as a representative. Mr. Wu graduated from the Department of Religious Studies of Shanghai University in 1929 and has served as a pastor in Zhenjiang, Shanghai, and other places. It is also heard that during his time abroad, all the duties of the General Secretary will be concurrently and voluntarily taken by Mr. Nie Junwen Nie, the principal of the Muzhao Li Middle School of the Yangzhou Baptist Church.

### American Warship Movements

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that the American warship Henderson arrived today (the 11th), two days later than scheduled. The ship will carry Marine Corps soldiers whose term of service in China has expired and will sail back to the United States on the 21st of this month. The flagship of the Yangtze River Patrol Fleet, the USS Luzon, carrying Rear Admiral Glassco, sailed from Shanghai for Nanjing yesterday afternoon (the 10th) and will remain there for several days.

### US Rear Admiral Hart to Arrive in Shanghai on Schedule to Take Office - Will Be Promoted to Full Admiral Immediately After Taking Office as Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet

The Chinese-language Shanghai newspaper North-China Daily News reports that it learned yesterday (the 10th) from official naval circles that Rear Admiral Hart is scheduled to replace Admiral Yarnell as Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet in Shanghai on July 25. Rear Admiral Hart is currently aboard the President Coolidge and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on July 19. The flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, carrying Admiral Yarnell, is scheduled to arrive here on July 18 and will be berthed at the head of the line of warships in the Huangpu River. Admiral Yarnell has scheduled July 25 as the day of the handover. On that day, a ceremony will be held on the aft deck of the flagship. Admiral Yarnell will read his orders and hand over the command of the fleet to Rear Admiral Hart. Rear Admiral Hart will then read his orders in front of the officers and men of the flagship, stating that he has taken over as Commander-in-Chief. Then Admiral Yarnell's flag will be lowered and replaced with Rear Admiral Hart's flag. Rear Admiral Hart will be promoted to full admiral immediately after taking office as Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet. There are only four full admirals in the US Navy. The other three admirals are the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commander-in-Chief of the US Fleet, and the Commander of the Battle Force of the US Fleet. It is learned that Rear Admiral Hart is coming to Shanghai from Washington, where he was the Chairman of the General Board of the Navy. He recently relinquished his position. Rear Admiral Hart was born in Davison, Michigan, on June 12, 1897. He graduated from the US Naval Academy and the Naval and Army War Colleges. He was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1929 and served as Superintendent of the US Naval Academy from 1931 until he relinquished his position in 1935. Admiral Yarnell is scheduled to leave Shanghai on August 1 aboard the President Coolidge.

### Despite Zhejiang Coast Blockade - Sales Unaffected - Trade Commission Issues Tea Funds of 450,000 Yuan to Various Counties

The Zhejiang Provincial War Zone Products Transportation and Sales Office recently released the following information on the province's recent product transportation and sales situation. (1) The problem of tea procurement. The procurement of tea in Zhejiang Province this year was originally entrusted by the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission to the provincial government. Later, because the China Tea Company presented to the central government for approval to purchase tea in Zhejiang, the China Tea Company and the Products Transportation and Sales Office are now purchasing tea at the same time. However, the autumn tea starting in the second half of the year may be purchased solely by the company. (2) The problem of future product exports. Even if the Zhejiang sea coast is completely blockaded in the future and there are difficulties in exporting special products, it will not be a problem because the central government has already paid attention to planning early on. The intermodal transport by water and land between Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces is becoming increasingly developed, and the transportation and sales of Zhejiang's special products will not be hindered. This is clearly visible. (3) The problem of tea funds in various counties. The Trade Commission has now allocated 450,000 yuan, which will be transferred by the Products Transportation and Sales Office to various counties.

### Summer Rickshaws - Can Raise Canopies

Recently, the weather has been extremely hot. Pedestrians on the street are all sweating profusely. Those who ride in rickshaws also feel the heat of the scorching sun. However, passengers can make use of the cloth canopies provided on the rickshaws and instruct the drivers to raise them to reduce the heat. The rumor that the police are not allowing rickshaws to raise their canopies on sunny days is absolutely untrue.

### Hongkou is the Center for Pirated Books - Great Losses for Chinese Merchants - Textbooks for Large, Medium, and Small Schools Included - Content Altered and Covers Also Changed

The Chinese-language newspaper Continental Daily News reports that in Hongkou and other parts of the Japanese-occupied area, the piracy of books is also rampant. The victims are not foreign publishers, but Chinese commercial firms in this city. Those engaged in this business appear to have the permission and encouragement of the Japanese authorities and are currently reprinting thousands of books whose copyrights are exclusively owned by well-known publishing companies in this city. This information was provided by reliable sources, and those who provided this information have suffered huge losses in the printing and publishing business since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. It is said that the headquarters of the pirated books in Hongkou is located at the World Book Bureau Printing Factory at 130 Dalian Bay Road, named Huazhong Printing Company. The World Book Bureau Printing Factory was one of the few Chinese large commercial firms that did not move its machinery and inventory out of the war zone during the military uprising the year before last. Tens of millions of books stored in the warehouses of the book bureau were confiscated by the Japanese, and the Japanese army and navy authorities used the building as a headquarters. More than tens of millions of textbooks were confiscated and transported to Japan. Several million copies have been retained here as originals for reprinting. A certain bookseller in the Public Concession has collected these pirated books and showed them to reporters yesterday (the 10th). All kinds of books used in large, medium, and small schools, such as revised Chinese and English textbooks, have been reprinted by this new company in Hongkou. The content has been modified, and the names of the publishers have also been changed. Many scientific books among the pirated books have not been changed from the original, except that the covers are no longer the same. According to the bookseller who collected these books, the reason for confiscating books owned by Chinese people was that they were anti-Japanese. If that is the case, why are the Japanese themselves reprinting and selling them today? This is really no different from robbery.

### Resuming the Joint Venture Plan - Japanese Monopoly on the Match Industry - The So-Called "General Office" is Established in Tianjin - Shanghai "Branch Office" Operates in the Enterprise Building - Participants Include as Many as Twenty-Two Companies

The "China National Match Joint Venture", a Sino-Japanese joint venture before the war, is now being revived, and the "Shanghai Branch" will open soon. Details are explored below.

Shanghai Branch Established

Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the "National Joint Venture" was established in Shanghai by Sino-Japanese manufacturers in a joint venture, but it only appeared briefly before fading into obscurity. Now that the Japanese side is gradually expanding the occupied areas in an attempt to control the Chinese economy to achieve its aggressive ambitions, it is implementing controls separately, and the Chinese match industry is also being coveted. It is heard that under the direction of the Japanese authorities, in addition to establishing the "China National Match Joint Venture General Office" in Tianjin, a "Branch Office" has recently been established in Shanghai. The Japanese Mr. Sawada serves as the chairman, and the representatives of the Chinese factories are merely appendages of the company, with no rights or interests to speak of.

Participating Factories

According to sources in the match industry, the Chinese manufacturers participating in the company include Shanghai Ying, Zhen Ying, Zhonghua, Guanghua, Hong Sheng, Yu Sheng, Zhengda, Tong Sui, Chu Sheng, Zhongguo, Dahua, Huai Shang, Daming, Minsheng, Sui Chang, Guangming, Zhongnan, Jiangbei, Ganxing, Hefeng, Bianmin, Meiguo, and twenty-two others. Each is assigned one to two, three, or four "representatives" to the company. However, most of the above factories have been forcibly occupied and put into operation by the Japanese, so they are actually no different from Japanese businesses.

Scheduled to Open

The "Shanghai Branch" is currently located on the fifth floor of the Enterprise Building at 33 Sichuan Road. Preparations are already in place. When a reporter from the Daguan News Agency visited the company yesterday, as Chinese merchants were participating, they saw Chinese and Japanese people together in high spirits and busy with cooperative work. They refused to meet with visitors and refused to reveal any information. Later, it was learned from relevant sources that the company will open around the 15th of this month. In the future, the business of various Chinese factories will be controlled by the Japanese, and the conspiracy of economic plunder will be actively implemented. It is heard that many manufacturers are aware of the overall situation and are willing to sacrifice themselves, vowing not to cooperate with them.

### Foreign Banks Control Black Market Exchange Rates, Stabilization Committee Exerts Effort to Stabilize Exchange Rates, Authorizes HSBC to Restrict Swap Transactions

Since the Ministry of Finance issued regulations for applying to purchase foreign exchange for imported goods, and established a Foreign Exchange Examination Committee in Chongqing, businesses wishing to apply must request it from the committee. However, legal foreign exchange is not granted for goods transported to occupied areas. Therefore, goods transported to Shanghai, whether necessities or luxury goods, must still purchase foreign exchange on the Shanghai black market. The Shanghai black market exchange rate is still maintained by the British-owned HSBC Bank. The bank's listed rates are kept at a horizontal level, namely six and a half pence for the British pound and 12.625 yuan for the US dollar. However, to prevent speculators from manipulating the market, foreign exchange swaps are restricted. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee still adheres to its established policy of exerting effort to stabilize foreign exchange prices and maintains the Shanghai black market. It also cooperates with the British-owned HSBC and Mercantile Banks. Therefore, the decision to restrict foreign exchange swaps is said to have been authorized by the committee to HSBC. Although the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has been ordered to cease processing applications for legal foreign exchange from various businesses, it still publishes the legal foreign exchange rates daily, namely two shillings and a half pence for the British pound and 30 US dollars. From now on, legal foreign exchange for the import of necessities will be subject to review by the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee, which will designate the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to handle it. However, the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications do not handle applications for foreign exchange from various businesses because Shanghai is an occupied area. The import of foreign goods into Shanghai will inevitably be unable to obtain legal foreign exchange and must purchase it on the black market. However, the black market is controlled by foreign banks and already has a standard exchange rate as a blueprint. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee continues to perform its function of balancing exchange rates, making it difficult for speculators and those attempting to profit from foreign exchange purchases to do as they please. Therefore, the foreign exchange market is unlikely to undergo any significant changes.

### Dutch Minister Returns Home

### Commemorative Stamps Celebrating American Independence Acquired by Shanghai Philatelists, Embellished with Chinese and American Flags and a Map of the Republic of China, Banned in Occupied Areas, Not Sold in Shanghai

The Directorate General of Posts issued commemorative stamps celebrating the 150th anniversary of American independence. These stamps were discovered in Shanghai yesterday, purchased by philatelists from Chongqing. However, the Shanghai post office has not yet received them and there is no prospect of them being sold, making them particularly valuable.

Stamp Design

The commemorative stamps for the 150th anniversary of American independence issued by the Directorate General of Posts were printed by the American Bank Note Company. The complete set consists of four types, each 39 cm high and 54 cm wide. The words "Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of American Independence" are printed on them in a horizontal arrangement. In the upper left corner, the national flag of the Republic of China (Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth) is printed, and in the lower corner, the American flag is printed. In the center is a map of the Republic of China.

Colors and Values

The commemorative stamps are divided into four colors according to their value: the five-cent stamp is green, the 25-cent stamp is blue, the 50-cent stamp is brown, and the one-yuan stamp is pink. The Chinese and American flags are printed in their original colors, making them vivid and aesthetically pleasing.

Not Issued in Shanghai

These stamps were printed by the American Bank Note Company. The first batch was printed and sold by the Kunming Postal Administration. However, each purchase was accompanied by a small English envelope containing a Chinese translation with the following serious words: "We advise you not to use these stamps on mail sent to occupied areas." From the above wording, it is unlikely that the Shanghai post office will be able to sell these commemorative stamps. A photograph of this valuable commemorative stamp is reproduced above.

### Remembering Mr. Qin Runqing, a Veteran of the Money Shop Industry (Part 2)

— Zhou

Mr. Qin began by recounting a brief history of the rise and fall of the Shanghai money shop industry. He said: Before the Taiping Rebellion, the most developed area for money shops in Shanghai was in the Nanshi (South City) because at that time, ships from other ports were all sailing vessels and docked near the 16th Pier, so merchants gathered in this area. Later, when the Taiping army entered Southeast China, Shanghai became a region where floating capital concentrated. By the middle of the Guangxu era, there were 40 money shops in Nanshi and 50 in Beishi (North City) in Shanghai, but their business scope was also limited. The total annual receipts and payments of each shop were less than one million taels of silver. Because interest rates were higher and expenses were lower at that time, most of them had surpluses. Taking salaries at the time as an example, the manager of a money shop earned no more than 200 or 300 yuan per year, and ordinary employees earned 10 yuan or tens of yuan per year. After the Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion, the money shop industry began to decline. In the early years of the Xuantong era, it was affected by the rubber stock craze, followed by the Revolution of 1911, and the number of money shops in Shanghai Beishi was reduced by half. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the period around 1922 and 1923 was the most developed period for the money shop industry. After 1927, banks gradually increased, and the money shop industry found it difficult to develop due to several changes. In 1935, the government implemented the silver policy, and the money shop industry felt increasingly inferior due to the mortgage of real estate. Now, the money shop industry itself can ensure credit and consolidate business, which is gratifying.

Mr. Qin continued to talk about the future of the money shop industry. He firmly believed that the money shop industry would never fail. The reason is that the money shop industry has a history of more than 100 years and has always regarded credit lending as its main business. When the funds of various industries are insufficient, they mostly rely on money shops to adjust. Over the past 100 years, there have been many cases of industries and businesses with small amounts of capital achieving great scale. If they unfortunately fail in business, the money shop is determined to help as much as possible, and it is common to see them revive and restore their former glory. China's economic organization is immature and backward, which is undeniable. All industries rely on credit loans to inject funds. Therefore, in terms of China's industrial and commercial economic situation, the business operated by money shops still has great prospects.

Based on his successful history and experience in running the money shop industry, he believed that if money shops concentrate on their business efforts, they will never suffer setbacks. The reason for their setbacks is all due to personal relationships, or excessive lending, or individuals running other businesses concurrently. Because they are affected by unpredictable influences, the money shop is also affected. Even if an employee concentrates on his job and thinks about the interests of the business everywhere, unexpected setbacks will never occur. His conclusion is that if you don't seek personal gain, you won't fail. This is true for individuals and for businesses. This is truly a matter of experience and cannot be erased.

Finally, Mr. Qin expressed his sincere love, concern, and encouragement to this newspaper. He said: "I love to read the Shen Bao. I hope that the Shen Bao can provide more materials needed by the general public and provide guidance."

### A Visit to the New Java Liner "Tjitjalengka"

— Wen Xing

Anyone who pays a little attention to European and American liners knows the names of several shipping companies, such as Lloyd Triestino, British India, Norddeutscher Lloyd, President Lines, and China Merchants. This is because these liners have a large tonnage and luxurious facilities, and have a reputation as "sea palaces," which is undeniable. In fact, the Java Line is the closest to the Chinese people and has the most Chinese passengers.

The Java Line's routes are in the area of the South Seas Islands. Its first route is from Shanghai via Xiamen, Hong Kong, Little Luzon, Cebu, Manado, Makassar, Bali to Surabaya. The second route is from Shanghai via Xiamen, Hong Kong, Wen Island, Batavia, Cirebon, Semarang to Surabaya.

We may still be a little unfamiliar with the names of these South Seas Islands, but we must not ignore that these places are where overseas Chinese work hard and struggle to survive. It can be said that today's brilliant South Seas were built by overseas Chinese. The Java Company's liners sail year-round to places where overseas Chinese live. Every year, tens of millions of overseas Chinese travel from Xiamen to the South Seas or from the South Seas back to Xiamen, all on Java ships.

The Java Line has several ships, such as the "Tjinegara," "Tjisadane," "Tjisaroa," "Tjibadak," and "Tjisalak," which have a large tonnage and very comfortable facilities. In particular, they are suitable for Chinese customs. The layout of the restaurant is like the Xing Hua Lou in Shanghai, with round mahogany tables and long sleeping chairs, fully expressing the flavor of South China. When overseas Chinese board the ship, they seem to be at home.

Now, the Java Company has a new ship making its maiden voyage to Shanghai. The ship is named "M.S. Tjitjalengka," built by the Netherlands Shipbuilding Company, with a gross tonnage of 17,150 tons, a horsepower of 6,000, a speed of 15 nautical miles per hour, a length of 474 feet and 10 inches, and a width of 64 feet and 6 inches. The depth from the deck to the bottom of the cabin is 38 feet and 6 inches, the draft is 28 feet and 9 inches, and the cargo tonnage is 9,930 tons. It can carry 1,420 passengers, 64 in first class (each with its own bathroom), 55 in second class, 100 in third class, and 1,200 in steerage. This new liner is more advanced and perfect in style and facilities than the "Tjisadane." It has a sports field, swimming pool, radio station, library, hospital, pharmacy, and other facilities such as a social room, smoking room, barber shop, and bar. There is also a glass-enclosed walkway on the deck for rainy days. The lighting is beautifully arranged, and the heating and cooling equipment is suitable. Each cabin is equipped with a radio, which broadcasts various music and current events reports at any time. The kitchen and food storage room also have special equipment that can make the food fresh and delicious.

Yesterday evening, several of us were invited by the Java Company to visit this new liner on its maiden voyage to Shanghai. The small boat departed from the Custom House Wharf. The "Scott No. 1" tugboat was crowded with many visitors. The large number of people was truly beyond our expectations. After more than 20 minutes, we arrived at the new "Tjitjalengka."

When we boarded the ship, we felt a sense of brightness in front of us, like a new house. What was placed in front of us were all happy and "new" decorations, and everyone was filled with a sense of joy. We looked at the first-class cabin to the upper deck, to the bow and stern, to our heart's content. After 6 o'clock, we took the original tugboat back to Shanghai.

In the evening, the Java Company hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel to entertain guests from all walks of life. The event was hosted by the manager Mr. Ge Li Ai, the Chinese manager Qian Chongfu, and important staff members Chen Shide and Zhu Shoupeng. There were more than 800 Chinese and foreign guests, and the sound of joy lasted until late at night.

The Magnificent Appearance of the "Tjitjalengka"

### Rice Market Supplies Increased Greatly in the Last Two Days, About 10,000 Bags Arrived Daily, Sales Were Sluggish, Hoping the Authorities Would Set Price Limits Again During This Period

The rice in the Shanghai market comes from Songjiang, Minhang, Tongli, Pingwang, Luxu, Zhu Jing, Qingpu, Zhangyan, Ba Chi, Zhu Jiajiao, and Zhejiang in Jiangsu Province, which is called the South Gang. Wuxian, Kunshan, Changshu, Wujin, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Yixing, etc. are called the North Gang rice. Those who come from Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei are called Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei rice, and are divided into glutinous and indica rice. New rice from various places will be launched soon, with the new japonica rice from Pudong being the earliest, around early August. Jiaxing's Yangjian and Wuhu's Indica rice will be available in mid-August, while Du rice will be available around the end of August. However, the late rice will be fully available before the end of September.

More Arrivals Than Sales, Supply Exceeds Demand

The price of domestic rice has recently shifted from stable to declining due to the gradual increase in arrivals. Inland river transportation has also gradually recovered, and the number of arrivals from the river has increased. Rice boats that were blocked in the Songjiang area have been released and have arrived in Shanghai one after another, greatly increasing the supply. On the 10th, arrivals from various places included eight or nine ships from the river, more than ten trucks by train, and five or six thousand bags by sea, totaling more than ten thousand bags. On the 11th, there were also seven or eight thousand bags. However, due to (1) the hot weather is not suitable for hoarding, (2) the lack of cash, (3) rice shops and hoarders are trying to sell their goods on the market, and (4) arrivals are sold on the market, the market sales are sluggish, and the supply exceeds demand, causing the rice price to fall sharply, returning to within the price limit. The average decline is about three or five corners. This proves that although the rice stored in each rice warehouse has been reduced to 399,902 bags, there is a lot of rice stored in each rice store and by citizens, which is enough for three months. Therefore, the transactions at each rice shop have shifted to negotiation. All sectors hope that the concession authorities will adjust the price limit again at this time to reduce the burden on citizens.

Imported Rice to Arrive at the End of the Month

The Saigon imported rice commissioned by the Shanghai Grain Merchants Association from Da Fu Foreign Company, totaling 600 tons, has been loaded and shipped and is expected to arrive at the end of this month. It is reported that Saigon rice is divided into three types: Fa Luo, Ge Kun, and Bai Sai. The rice ordered this time is Ge Kun rice, produced in Ge Kun, which is round and firm, with excellent quality, and is a superior rice. The price of each bag of the imported rice, which is one stone and two and a half buckets, is 21 yuan, and it is imported tax-free. However, after arriving in Shanghai, due to the decline in the price of domestic rice in Shanghai, it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain a large profit.

### Jiangxi Natives in Shanghai Initiate Relief for Jiangxi Disaster

The disaster in Jiangxi Province has been extremely serious, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced, without clothing or food. At this time of extreme heat, there is a risk of disease and increased mortality everywhere. Jiangxi natives here have received Jiangxi letters one after another and are very anxious. Therefore, a Jiangxi Natives in Shanghai Jiangxi Disaster Relief Fundraising Committee was organized a few days ago. Hu Siyi, Yu Jiancheng, Qi Litang, Li Hanqing, Zhu Chi Yang, Dai Yuheng, Hui Shimei, and other seven people were elected as standing committee members. The Yumin Bank on Ningbo Road was used as the meeting place, and fundraising was actively carried out. In a few days, they plan to appeal to various groups and people from all walks of life in the city, requesting donations to save them.

### Check Number Error, Cash Out Deposit, Obviously Embezzled, Original Account Found Error, Person in Charge Detained for Investigation

On March 31st of this year, the Yongxin Hemp Weaving Company at No. 406 Jiangxi Road had a current account with the China Reclamation Bank at the intersection of Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road, with 100 yuan in legal tender. The bank filled out a checkbook with account number 6641. Soon, the company suddenly stated that it would cancel the account and return the checkbook. The China Reclamation Bank then returned the deposited funds and canceled the registration. Until the day before yesterday, Ge Yanqing, account number 6755 of the bank, issued a check to withdraw 300 yuan from the China Reclamation Bank. However, after the bank staff checked, Ge had withdrawn 300 yuan on July 4th, and the current balance was less than 300 yuan, so they refused to pay. However, Ge stated that she had not recently withdrawn any funds from the bank, so she negotiated with the bank. After a detailed investigation by the bank, the check for 300 yuan withdrawn on July 4th was found to have the check number 3511170, which was previously issued to Yongxin Company, account number 6641. Furthermore, the account number on the check, 6641, had been涂off, and the account number 6755 of the depositor was added to it. Obviously, someone was embezzling deposits from others. Therefore, Manager Wang Boyuan reported to the General Patrol Room. Detective Yang Peisheng and detective Qian Xianting rushed to investigate and believed that Zhou Liankui, a Ningbo native (residing at No. 476, Beisuzhou Road) and a staff member of the cashier department of the bank, was the person in charge of this matter and was suspected of embezzlement. He was detained and taken back to the police station. However, Zhou confessed. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the first criminal court of the Special First District Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi requested that Zhou be temporarily detained pending investigation on the grounds that the case still needed to be investigated in detail. After Judge Feng Shide approved the report, he ordered that he be returned to custody and the hearing be rescheduled for one week.

### Wanbao Silk Factory Owner Receives Threatening Letter, Detectives Arrest Three Criminals, Claiming to be a "Troupe to Eradicate the Traitors" Extorting 600 Yuan, Lured the Bandits to the Scene According to the Letter and Arrested Them

Li Mingzhi, the owner of Wanbao Silk Factory at No. 53 Singapore Road, received a letter at about 10 a.m. on the 10th, falsely claiming to be the Iron Blood Eradication Troupe, saying that you are really a traitorous merchant, and our brothers lack food and pay, so we are lending at least 600 yuan in legal tender. A person must be sent after 8 p.m., wearing a western suit and holding an umbrella as a symbol, to send the above-mentioned military pay, wrapped in paper, to the vicinity of the Golden Grand Theater in Ba Xian Bridge, French Concession, and wait for someone to contact you, otherwise your life will be difficult to protect.

The words were fierce. After receiving the letter, factory owner Li was very frightened and reported the letter to the Gordon Road Police Station. Detective Wang Cheng Ying ordered the factory staff surnamed Pan to dress in a western suit and leather shoes, holding an umbrella, and wrap the newspaper in the appearance of 600 yuan in legal tender. At that time, Detective Wang, along with detectives Lu Gen Di and Xu Gui Rong, detectives Xia Shutang, Bu Zongding, Bai Wenqi, Chen Shanji, and Western detective Yue Tailai, accompanied Representative Pan.

They first went to the vicinity of the Golden Grand Theater and lingered, while Detective Wang and Detective Xia dressed as merchants and stood at the entrance of the theater to observe the situation. After a while, a 14-year-old boy from Siyang came slowly from the Gongguan Road in the French Concession, saw Representative Pan, and asked, "Are you sent by our silk factory to deliver the money?" (The answer was yes). He then asked him to follow him to Gongguan Road. Detective Wang and Detective Xia followed closely.

When they arrived near a large cake stall at No. 35 Xiafei Road, Gong Enyue, an 18-year-old Tianjin native, suddenly walked out of the stall, holding a wooden stick, and without asking why, threw the paper bag containing 600 yuan of legal tender at the head of Representative Pan. At this time, Detective Wang and Detective Xia, along with the Western detective Yue Tailai and the Chinese detectives, surrounded Meng Gong and the cake stall and arrested them, including the stall owner, Cun Tang, a 42-year-old Siyang native.

They were taken back to the police station for detention and escorted to the third criminal court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 446, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law for attempted extortion by intimidation and stated that there was still one principal offender at large in the case. Since the victim Li Mingzhi has not arrived, please detain the defendants pending further investigation, etc. Then, Representative Pan testified to the course of events. The three defendants were questioned, and their confessions were ambiguous. Judge Huang Ri Jie ordered that they be returned to custody and the hearing be rescheduled.

However, Jiang did not do so and transported the goods to Hankou, selling them to Handi Yuantai Hardware Store for 2,000 yuan.

### Letter

To the Editor,

I am writing on behalf of my client, Madam Sun Zhu Ruizhen, who claims that the reports in the Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Shibao on July 8 regarding her lawsuit against Jiang Guopei for a loan were largely inaccurate and should be corrected. According to Madam Sun, although her husband, Sun Shaoqing, was prosecuted by the police for suspected barratry, the case was remanded for retrial by the Supreme Court. Subsequently, due to Mr. Sun's death, the case was dismissed by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Therefore, Mr. Sun's crime of barratry was not confirmed, and it is inappropriate for the Shen Bao and Shibao to refer to him as the "famous barrator Sun Shaoqing." As for the loan case against Jiang Guopei, it was indeed a cash loan initially. Witnesses Zhao Zelin and lawyer Li Gengxiang both stated that they had asked Jiang Guopei at the time, and he confirmed that the money had been received in full, as evidenced by court transcripts. Jiang Guopei obtained the deed of conveyance because he entrusted Zhao Zelin to negotiate with Madam Sun to obtain it for applying for a certificate of administration of inheritance. Furthermore, Jiang Guopei personally issued a receipt as proof. If Madam Sun had returned the deed of conveyance out of fear that Jiang Guopei would report her, why would Jiang Guopei have issued a receipt? The above points are significantly different from the newspaper reports and should be corrected separately. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction.

Sincerely,

Lawyer Zai Jiazuo

Science and Life

### A Remarkable Story in the Scientific World

— Xian

In countries with advanced science in Europe and America, the people are wealthy, and young people have many opportunities to study. However, there are still many poor young people who struggle hard in difficult circumstances. Among those who have achieved great success in science, their spirit of diligence and hard work is worthy of inspiring interest among young people in our country. I will tell one story here, hoping that young people in our country will be encouraged by it. There was a poor student in the United States whose father was a farmer who often worked as a hired laborer. This student was very studious from a young age and was fortunate enough to complete his studies at a secondary school with great difficulty. He wanted to enter university but was troubled by a lack of financial resources. His father gave him all the money he had saved over the years, but it was only seventy-five dollars. He entered the cheapest university, and his tuition fees and books exhausted all his money. So, he worked in a restaurant and got three meals a day. He lived in a basement and took care of the furnace fire and watered the flowers to avoid paying for lodging. He swept each classroom in the school and also worked short hours in various shops and post offices outside the school to earn pocket money. He spent his days in class and at work, with no free time, but because of his hard work and diligence, his academic performance was excellent. In his fourth year, the professor praised his ambition and promoted him to teaching assistant, so he got a better salary and no longer had to do odd jobs. After graduating, he stayed at the school and served as a regular teacher. Only then could he return home to visit his parents, and the money he had left in his pocket was all given to his father, and the amount was exactly seventy-five dollars. The villagers spread this story as a good one. This man later became a famous scientist, served as president of various universities and academic societies, and contributed greatly to promoting advanced research and promoting scientific education. He wrote extensively on specialized science and also wrote extensively on literature, philosophy, education, history, and social sciences. He was a leader in the American scientific community for more than forty years. He traveled to Europe, and universities, research institutes, and other academic institutions in various countries invited him to give lectures hundreds of times. He also advocated world peace and opposed wars of aggression, working for the harmony and happiness of mankind. He can be called a hero and is worthy of emulation by young people in our country. However, schools and society in the United States provide extra help to poor young people, and working part-time while studying is very popular. There are many talented young people in our country who are capable of being made, and I hope that domestic schools and society will pay attention to this point and learn from others' strengths.

### Ants: Natural Warriors

— Shang Yao

Nature is cruel, and the history of the animal kingdom is simply a history of struggle. But there are only two kinds of animals in the world that are most accustomed to killing each other. One is humans, and the other is ants.

It's really strange! These two kinds of animals are so different in form, but their social lives and habits are very similar. Ants live in politically enlightened countries, raise livestock, grow food—mostly small fungi—store grain, and build houses. Their buildings are much more advanced than the buildings of primitive humans.

The strangest thing is that ant wars are very similar to human wars. The tactics and strategies of ant armies are probably still considered a model for our military strategists.

In terms of natural weapons, ants are really much stronger than humans. Poor humans have no defensive weapons, and a pair of fists has very limited offensive value. But ants have a set of sturdy armor and a pair of powerful jaws. But these are just their basic weapons; they also have watchmen!

The most terrifying poison gas known in human warfare is mustard gas. Nature also gives ants a very similar weapon. Some ants can shoot a liquid a long distance. If it hits an enemy ant, the poor victim will be unable to move and will soon die. Even larger animals such as spiders and small birds cannot survive if they are exposed to this venom.

Many kinds of ants do not have this terrible weapon and rely entirely on their jaws to break the heads of their enemies, or even tear them to pieces.

The enemy of an ant is any ant in an enemy group, regardless of whether the intruder is of the same species, but there are no traitors in the group. They have a highly developed sense of smell and can distinguish who is a friend and who is an enemy. Once an external aggressor is encountered, the war begins immediately. They will not kneel down and beg for mercy, nor will they make peace midway.

If only a few ants from each side encounter each other, then the team with the smaller number of ants will immediately form a skirmish line and prepare to fight. If large armies face each other, when the fierce battle begins, they will use real tactics, the formation is very complete, and all plans are well thought out and without any mistakes.

The cause of war is either a dispute over territory or the expansion of territory due to an overpopulation of ants. A Swedish scientist once poured a bag of ants near the border of another ant colony, which caused a great war. He described it as follows.

At first, there was no movement because neither side knew where the enemy was. Soon, a few passing ants were accidentally captured by the invaders and immediately executed so that they would not have the opportunity to send an alarm. So, the invading forces immediately advanced. And the defending warriors also occupied advantageous military strongholds in the dense grass to await the enemy's attack.

At the beginning of the war, the defending army was outnumbered and retreated back to the city. The scientist, who was watching from the sidelines, saw that the ant army in the rear was really panicked, scurrying east and west, and extremely chaotic. At a critical moment, a force of reinforcements arrived unexpectedly.

This large team of reinforcements was ambushed in the city in advance. Now, with the swiftness of lightning, they rushed into the battlefield. After an hour and a half of desperate fighting, the enemy's fierce flames were dampened. Finally, they were defeated and fled in all directions. The ants who fought for self-defense finally won the final victory.

Ants and war are probably like this. But some kinds of ants like to use surprise attacks or surround the enemy instead of attacking directly. Another kind of guerrilla ant often appears and disappears unpredictably, making feints to the east and attacking in the west, disrupting the enemy. This can be regarded as the most brilliant tactic.

For example, when the Siafu ants of Africa march, they often form a dense column that is forty feet wide and several miles long. If they enter the territory of an enemy country, a team of soldiers is immediately dispatched, while the main force continues to advance. This team of soldiers then immediately separates again, one part completely blocking all the exits of the city to be attacked, and the other part rushes forward, and then the fight begins.

Sometimes teams of soldiers are constantly dispatched from the main camp, advancing at different angles. They are always dispatched from the flanks or behind the main camp, so that the front line always maintains its strength to prevent surprise attacks.

Once it comes to hand-to-hand combat, no one in the world can be as tenacious and brave as an ant. Once it bites an enemy, it will not let go until it dies. Even if its own head has been cut off, its iron jaws will still bite so desperately.

A person who is cowardly and does not move forward is not as good as an ant, and a person who is a tool of the tiger should be even more despised by ants.

Scientific Anecdotes

### Tiger's Might

— Ji Qian

Tigers are fierce beasts that prey on dogs, sheep, and other animals for food. Smaller animals mostly fear them. What is most strange is that even dead tigers, even those with dismembered limbs, are still enough to intimidate other animals. More than ten years ago, Xiamen police shot and killed a tiger in the mountains. This tiger was a Bengal tiger, taller and paler in color than those produced in mainland China. Several people carried it to the city so that the public could view it. And the dogs in the streets, seeing the tiger's corpse, all tucked their tails and fled, showing fear. Later, people from the Biology Department of Xiamen University skinned it and made it into a specimen. When its internal organs and various organs were thrown on the ground, the dogs that saw them also hesitated and fled. Is it because they smelled the tiger's scent and were afraid? The development of animal instinct is indeed undeniable.

### Tiger Meat

When the tiger's bones were carried to the biology lab at Xiamen University, there were two large masses of muscle attached to the base of the upper and lower jaw bones, which are called the masseter muscles. I ordered the specimen maker to take them off and cut them into pieces, filling a large pot. I mixed them with spices, soy sauce, and other things and stewed them, like braised beef. After a day and a night, they were finally cooked and tender. Because I thought that in one's life, how many times can one eat tiger meat? This was a rare opportunity. So, I invited colleagues from the school to taste it together. Some tasted it and left, while others came to watch but hesitated to try it. I ate a few pieces and felt that the muscle texture was very coarse, and the taste was like mutton, and also like beef, indescribable. Finally, I poured its soup on rice, but as soon as I swallowed it, I suddenly felt like vomiting. The taste was not bad, but there was something indescribable that made my stomach unable to accept it. I really don't know why.

### Alcohol Meter

— Rong Ren

Someone in England recently invented an alcohol meter that can not only make it easier for judges in court to determine whether a defendant is drunk, but also, if he is indeed drunk, to distinguish to what extent he is drunk.

First, have the defendant fill a balloon with exhaled air, and then pass the air through a lick of sulfuric acid solution that has been colored by a permanganate coloring agent. The color of this solution is like the color of "Lavender" flowers. If it turns gray-yellow after ventilation, it means that the air exhaled by the defendant contains enough alcohol to determine that he is drunk.

Only alcohol is sufficient to change the color of this acid solution. The degree of drunkenness only needs to look at the amount of gas needed to change the color of the solution.

No need to argue with a drunk. If the air he blows into the balloon can change the color of the solution, there is no doubt that he is drunk.

### The Latest Cryotherapy

— (Gu Buwen)

Patients are frozen for five days to receive medical treatment, and tumors can be cured with good results.

According to July 2nd

A Reuters dispatch from St. Louis, Missouri, USA, reports: There is now an unprecedented new medical experiment, which is to freeze patients and put them into a temporary state of suspended animation. This matter has attracted the extreme attention of the medical community. It was obtained by two major physicians, Dr. Temple S. Fay and Dr. Lawrence W. Suriah of Philadelphia, who conducted experiments on some of their cancer patients. They also want to apply this cryotherapy to patients with lung disease, heart disease, epilepsy, and various other diseases.

This cryotherapy has been reported by the two major physicians at the annual meeting of the American Medical Association, and its outline is as follows:

Patients undress and lie naked

Small pieces of ice are added all over the body, and electric fans are used to rotate and fan. After three hours, the patient's body temperature drops below ninety degrees, and they fall asleep peacefully, appearing to be napping. Although they are frozen, the process is normal and painless. The room is kept sufficiently cold so that even when the crushed ice moves, it remains cold as usual. After five days, the patient is awakened with hot coffee and hot drinks. At this time, the patient smiles and looks happy, but has no memory of everything that happened. According to the results of practical experiments on symptoms, this freezing cold force can kill at least 10% to 90% of the germs of rampant cancer cells.

This kind of life suspension

therapy not only amazes the medical community, but also makes it difficult to know its advantages for a while. Therefore, it has prompted the medical community to urgently study the necessary steps of cryotherapy.

When the patient is lying on the ice, their pulse stops, but by means of an electrocardiograph, it is found that their heart is still beating. What is most surprising is that although their heartbeat is very weak, its rhythm is complete and without any abnormalities. Also, their kidneys and digestive organs have stopped functioning, but this is only a sign of ordinary moribundity, and there seems to be no unexpected danger. Because at the same time, the analysis of their blood shows that it is filled with slag waste, so there is nothing to excrete.

Metabolism—the process of nourishing materials to promote vitality—has now dropped from 2% to 10%. In short, patients who have received this cryotherapy will definitely not be infected with pneumonia or a cold, and the development of germs in their entire structure has been significantly hindered.

Commercial News

### Finance: Operators Seem to Be Waiting, Cash Transactions Are Unusually Quiet

Yesterday, the cash market continued to improve, but the activity was extremely dull. The whole rotation was around 2,590 yuan, and the transaction was light. Blue operators were waiting for the clarification of the international political situation, so both buying and selling were always cautious. As a result, the price rose by five yuan because a certain money exchange industry came back and advanced again, and Tianjin Gang also stopped supplying. Although speculators once came to sell in the middle, it did not have any impact. Only about 300 taels were traded in the morning, and only dozens of taels in the afternoon. Gold ornaments in jewelry stores remained unchanged throughout the day, and customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable.

Cash Continues to Rise

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened higher by two yuan because a certain money exchange industry had a particularly good buying intention, resulting in a good market. First, a certain gold store bought twenty taels from a jewelry store at a price of 2,587 yuan, and then bought fifty taels from a peer at the same price. It then returned fifty taels to a certain money exchange industry at the original price. At that time, a certain money exchange industry also absorbed a total of 100 taels from a certain gold store (on behalf of a speculator) and fifty taels from a jewelry store, all at a price of 87 yuan. After that, a certain money exchange industry still had an appetite for the above transaction price, but there were no sellers watching, causing the market to be quiet for a while. Around 11 o'clock, the underlying trend continued to be slightly firmer, rising by three yuan. The gold stores mutually traded fifty taels at a price of 90 yuan. At noon, it jumped up another two yuan. A certain money exchange industry bought fifty taels from a peer at 92 yuan as the closing price at noon. In the afternoon, the transaction became clearer, and the trend was also flat. First, a jewelry store sold ten taels to a gold store at a price of 92 yuan. After entering, it was lowered by two yuan, and the money exchange industry mutually traded fifty taels at 2,590 yuan as the closing price at night. As a result, it continued to rise by five yuan compared to the previous day. The cash store's own brand gold was sold at a price of 2,595 yuan and bought at a price of 2,585 yuan. It is said that there are few transactions at present, with the bid gold being about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold.

Ornamental Gold Remains Unchanged Throughout the Day

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael has not changed because the cash market is in a state of rotation. The Daretong Hang still hangs at 262 yuan, while the Xintong Hang is at 260 yuan, and the purchase price is 254 yuan.

Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Stable

According to a London dispatch on the 10th, British pure gold remains unchanged, fixed at 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6 pence per ounce, so the market prices of the central banks have also not changed. The Chinese cash purchase price is 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao, the listed customs gold is 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen and 6 li, and the Shanghai standard bid gold price is 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao.

### Foreign Currencies Gradually Rise

Yesterday, the exchange rates for British pure gold and British-American exchange remained unchanged. Foreign exchange houses in this city were actively settling accounts. Foreign banks readily supplied funds, and market prices remained stable as before. On the open market, gold shops and silversmiths were avid buyers, with the market price at 2,587 yuan. Later, enthusiastic buying from trade associations and retail investors drove the price upward, closing at 92 yuan in the high range at noon. The afternoon opened at the same price, but trading was thin, closing at 2,590 yuan in the evening, a further increase of five yuan from the previous day. The supply and demand for British-American gold pounds were not strong, with British gold pounds firm and American gold pounds slightly weak. Demand for both British-American gold notes was high, and the tension in forward exchange rates remained. The market price was firm and brisk. Hong Kong and German gold notes were also in strong demand, but supply was insufficient, resulting in firm prices across the board. Japanese gold notes continued to rise, with the evening price at 9 jiao, 9 fen, 8 li. Demand for large notes was even greater, at 1 yuan, 0 fen, 7 li. Korean notes remained stable, unchanged at 8 jiao, 7 fen. Trading in the association was thin. Hongchang sold five British-American gold pounds to Changtai, and also sold 50 British gold pound notes to Maofeng, and 30 British gold pound notes to Tongfeng. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: British gold pounds up 5 fen, British gold notes up 2 fen, American gold pounds down 1 jiao, American surplus notes up 8 li, Hong Kong notes up 6 li, Annam and Italian notes up 1 fen each, German gold notes up 8 fen, and Australian gold notes up 1 jiao. All other currencies remained unchanged.

### Stronger Demand for U.S. Futures Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC posted rates without any changes. The black market for British-American exchange was very sluggish, presenting a monotonous state. This was because, although foreign firms had some settlement of accounts, foreign banks continued to provide ample supply, so the future trend was calm and activity was difficult. In the seven- and eight-month futures trading, US exchange dominated. The Western merchant Sassoon resumed buying in the middle, but the Bombay Silver Company continued to release funds, so the result was neither good nor bad. August futures were slightly firmer due to the dumping by Chinese firms and silver companies. There were very few seven- and eight-month swaps opened today. It was heard that banks were willing to post prices with a monthly interest rate of over 3 fen, but such opportunities were rare. Trading throughout the day was flat. Sassoon was only heard to have bought US exchange, and no settlement of shillings was heard. The Hong Kong exchange rate broke into the 44 yuan range, likely because foreign firms were taking advantage of profitable force purchases.

British-American Exchange Rates Remain Mediocre

Early in the morning, recent London large bar prices plummeted 8.125, and forward rates contracted sharply by one basis point. The price of silver in New York fell sharply by 1.75. The price of London refined gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate for British versus American was down slightly by 0.3 hao, flat against Shanghai, and down by 1 shengding against French. The exchange rates for American versus British, Shanghai, and French all remained unchanged. Central-listed exchange rates remained as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was British gold at 6 basis points, 5625, and US exchange at 12 yuan, 78125, with no increase or decrease compared to yesterday. After opening, foreign firms first force-bought HSBC spot British gold at 6 basis points, 5625, and also bought and settled a certain bank's spot US exchange at 2 yuan, 78125. The process was extremely flat. When HSBC announced its listed prices, there were no changes. And the balance tax for silver remained exempt from taxation. After this, trading in US exchange futures was more active, but the market trend was also very mediocre. It is estimated that a North China seller traded US exchange to the Orient company this month at 12 yuan, 625. Then, Huaxing Guohua transferred US exchange for August to a certain silver company at 12 yuan, 1875. Later, the Western merchant Sassoon bought US exchange from the Bombay Silver Company for this month at 12 yuan, 59375, and also August US exchange at 12 yuan, 1875. Near noon, there were only transactions in Hong Kong exchange. A foreign firm vigorously bought spot prices of the foreign bank Anda at only 44 yuan, in a rather soft state. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price for British exchange was calculated at 6 basis points, 5625, and US exchange was 12 yuan, 78125, no different from the morning opening.

Hong Kong Exchange Enters 44 Yuan

In the later market, foreign firms continued to force the settlement of spot British gold at 6 basis points, 5625, and spot US exchange at 12 yuan, 78125, with HSBC and other foreign banks and a certain US bank, and the situation remained flat. Afterward, the Indian Silver Company transferred to a certain bank US exchange for this month at 12 yuan, 625. The futures market trend was also stable. At that time, a foreign firm vigorously bought spot Hong Kong exchange from the foreign bank Holland at only 43 yuan, 875, and the market situation continued to soften. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 6 basis points, 5625, US exchange at 12 yuan, 78125, British gold for July at 6 basis points, 46875, US exchange at 12 yuan, 59375, British gold for August at 6 basis points, 25, and US exchange at 12 yuan, 1875. As a result, spot and July prices showed no difference, while August was slightly higher by 0.03125 for British, and slightly harder by 0.0625 for US. The Hong Kong exchange rate, calculated at the transaction price, was surprisingly tight by 0.375.

### Discount Rate Shows Slight Decline

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills and notes decreased slightly. In the morning, it was still 93 yuan per thousand yuan. It wasn't until the afternoon that it gave way, falling to 92 yuan, which was slightly lower than the previous day by one yuan. The interest rates for money changers remained unchanged, at 1 jiao and 8 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### American Silver Falls Sharply Again

A London dispatch on the 10th reports that the silver market saw widespread selling and lacked support. India and speculators bought at low prices. After the close, the market stabilized. India took in deliveries at the listed price, but because sellers' intentions gradually faded, most were largely watching. Recent large bar silver prices fell sharply by 8.125, and forward rates contracted sharply by one basis point. A New York telegram reports that American spot also fell sharply by 1.75 to 3.5. A Bombay telegram reports that the Indian silver market collapsed, with spot prices down 23 anna, July down 28 anna, and August down a small 30 anna. A total of 300 transaction orders were made.

### No Date Set for Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes

The Ministry of Finance replied to the Chamber of Commerce via telegram stating that fractional currency notes will be issued by the Central Bank. Reports also say that they have already been printed in Hong Kong and may be issued at the beginning of next month. However, according to investigations, relevant departments in Shanghai have not yet seen any official documents, so the date of issuance is still unknown.

### Securities, Domestic and Foreign Bonds Plunge Simultaneously

In the informal securities market, the downtrend did not subside yesterday. Public sentiment gradually shifted from being soft to becoming panicked. Since rumors arose about the issue of interest payments, bondholders have been in a fog, groping in the dark for whether to buy or sell. The slightest stimulus would cause a tremor, so the market's instability was entirely affected by this. According to common sense, changing the payment of principal and interest to exchange settlement is beneficial and cost-effective. The current market price is also commensurate. If it is stopped, even temporarily, financial chaos will inevitably arise. The relationship between gain and loss is extremely important. Drinking poison to quench thirst is something the wise do not do. Yesterday's market was initially strong but then weakened, down by a small amount from the previous day. Initially, Shunheng Tiansheng was buying, and Fuchun and retail investors also had a strong appetite. Then, No. 35 was selling, especially Type C. Lianhe was active in selling Type A. In addition, Nos. 20, Xiedafeng, Yuanyuan Tongsheng, etc., were all providing supply, so the price could not be supported. At the same time, Nos. 11 and Tongkang slightly compensated, but the number was small, resulting in a low closing price. The trend is still quite uncertain. As a result, the market price was down by 1.12 to 1.6 yuan from the previous day. The total number of transactions was estimated at 6-700,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.

Stock trading: 25 shares of Commercial Press were traded at a price of 67.5 yuan.

The price reported by the Public Industry Association seems stable, and there is little trading activity. There are no unexpected news items that could increase buying power. Although there are unfavorable situations, the stock market has already been hit, but selling pressure has not been crowded. According to convention, trading is often slack at this time of year, but there are still inquiries in the market. The traded shares are also slightly broader. Last week, the stock of British rubber raw materials decreased by another 1,700 tons. Progress continues to be seen in the statistical situation of commodity raw materials.

The listed prices of London British-owned Far East companies' shares on the 10th of this month (Monday) fell slightly. HSBC Bank shares each fell by half a pound. Shares registered in London were 79 pounds, and shares registered in Hong Kong were 80 pounds. Kaiping Coal Mine and Korean Coal Mine each fell by 3 pence, the former being 17 shillings and 9 pence, and the latter being 4 shillings and 9 pence. All others remained unchanged.

The listed prices of London Chinese foreign debt on the 10th of this month (Monday). The main bonds guaranteed by the upper-level salt tax have fallen again. Sino-French US dollars (with seal) and British-French loans (British-issued) each fell by 4 pounds. The new low prices were all 40 pounds. All others fell by 1 pound. British-German Continuation (British-issued) was 46 pounds, Crispe was 21 and a half pounds, and Reorganization (British-issued) was 32 and a half pounds. The Beining Railway's public price was 44 pounds. All others remained unchanged. London spot offers for sale include 1,500 pounds of Reorganization (French-issued, with seal), selling at 30 pounds, 15 shillings, down 1 pound, 15 shillings compared to the British-issued listed price. Also, 1,500 pounds of German-issued (with seal) were sold at 27 pounds, 2 shillings, 6 pence, down 5 pounds, 7 shillings, 6 pence compared to the British-issued listed price. Also, in this city, there are also 600 pounds of Reorganization (French-issued) for sale, but the price has not been offered.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculative Maneuvering Ultimately Unsustainable, Cotton Yarn Market Takes a Sharp Turn Downward, Difficult Transportation and Limited Actual Sales, "Double Horse" and Other Yarns Fall by 10 Yuan Each

The yarn market, which had risen sharply the previous day, suddenly declined yesterday, and the speed of the changes and the magnitude of the fluctuations made it very difficult to grasp. This situation was entirely due to the actions of general speculators. According to investigations, the goods transported by the Guangdong guild mostly entered and exited through Mazhang. That place requires the addition of taxes on goods passing through. Cotton yarn, in particular, is heavily taxed. Secondly, because of the concentration of Japanese warships in Beihai, the situation is tense. Thus, the market reacted abruptly and turned downward. According to people in the industry, in fact, from the perspective of the cotton yarn itself, with tight credit, it is impossible to accept loans. All seaports are blocked and obstructed everywhere. However, the bullish concept in the industry has never stopped. Rumors of North China collecting cash and not recognizing it in legal tender were met with deep suspicion. Everyone was buying in, and as a result, the market price advanced steadily. Unexpectedly, when prices are high, buyers can profit, and the desire to exit the market arises spontaneously. For a time, everyone in the industry took the same step. When the market had few takers, the downtrend was intense, and the market turned sharply downward. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn went from 490 yuan straight to 477 yuan, and there was still difficulty selling it at the closing price. This situation is inevitably too violent.

The current yarn market situation: At the opening of the morning market, carrying on the momentum of the previous day, industry peers gathered together and unanimously shouted prices high. However, it already showed signs of being at the end of its strength, with hesitation to move forward. The ticket price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn opened at 482 yuan, and the outside price was 489 yuan, both up 2-3 yuan. As soon as these prices opened, sellers on the table poured out. Guangdong guilds also had agents who made some progress at the opening, but then were seen releasing. As a result, the market situation was greatly relaxed. Shouting prices were small, and bad news came in droves. Although Mr. So-and-so, etc., had the intention to maintain prices, even though their economic situation was considered sufficient, at this urgent time, the money industry could not be accommodated, and there was no way to think. They had no choice but to leave. Until the closing price, the spot price of "Double Horse" was 477 yuan, and the ticket price was 469 yuan. Checking the opening and closing prices reveals a huge difference of 13-14 yuan. As a result, the half-day transaction statistics were 895 bales, with 20-count "Double Horse" down 10.5 yuan, "Shepherd" down 7 yuan, "Double Globe" down 10 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn also down 2-3 yuan. The factory opened with 30 bales of 23-count Dafa from Chongxin Factory, with a price of 117 yuan, all cash. The amounts bought by various guilds are listed on the left.

The Japanese yarn market began to rise again, and then gradually declined, resulting in a very tired market. This is because the route for yarn sales is declining, and all routes are affected by tight credit, making it difficult to move goods. The current price for 20-count Yueqin yarn is 386 yuan.

### Shenxin Urges Delivery of Goods, Deadline for Advance Payment This Month, Customers Who Have Made Profits of 100 Yuan But Have Not Yet Delivered Goods

Shenxin Yarn Factory has recently notified all customers that the yarn that was purchased previously, including the 20-count "Double Horse" yarn opened last year at a price of 368.5 yuan, and 390 yuan, are all 30% cash and 70% exchange, and the 410 yuan is all cash. According to the current market price, each piece of cotton yarn can profit 5-60 yuan to 100 yuan. However, these customers have not yet come to the factory to advance payment for delivery. The deadline is now set at July 15, after which they will be canceled and invalid.

### US Loan Cotton Prices Will Be Maintained Above Eight Points, Trading in Local Cotton Turns Dull Again

Foreign cotton market prices: At the opening of the fine and short cotton market, the industry was active due to the reduction in the weekly field report, and banks and other parties were vigorously buying. The opening price rose by 6 pounds. It is widely rumored that the US government will exchange cotton for goods from other countries and is currently in negotiations. According to news from Washington, the US cotton export subsidy plan will be announced this weekend, with each pound subsidized at a large amount, perhaps around 1.5 fen. Loan cotton prices will also be maintained between 8.25 points. As a result, people are extremely excited, and the price has surged by 17-18 pounds. However, due to the impact of US cotton subsidies, India, along with predictions, has fallen sharply by 2 rupees, and Egypt has fallen by more than 40 pounds.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is becoming increasingly difficult. Although credit is extremely tight, larger factories have enough inventory to last for five months, so trading is particularly quiet. The difficulty is that it will be difficult for various industry players to operate in the future.

Trading in local cotton has entered a dull path again because the yarn market is sluggish, the factory's needs are quiet, and industry players also find it difficult to raise cash, so even if they have the intention, it is difficult to develop. The quietness of business is the reason for this. There was only one transaction by industry players, which was a mixed price, with Bailuo taking 200 pieces at a price of 101 yuan, HSBC settlement, and a smooth flow of goods from northern Jiangsu. 734 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the dock.

### Piece Goods, Autumn and Winter Futures Trading Scattered

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday's cloth market price was still soft. The factory prices for white goods were all high. However, the industry and hoarders have a very large stock of goods on hand. Recently, they have been affected by the tightening of credit, and most tend to sell. Only a few with financial resources still have plans to increase the amount of hoarding. Very few futures orders are opened. First, the prices of most long-term goods are viewed favorably, and the opening prices are all high. Second, customers lack confidence in future business operations and are also afraid that credit will be squeezed in the future. Therefore, although the autumn and winter season is approaching, long-distance customers are not as keen to open orders as early as in April and May. This can show the dominance of speculators. Current sales are still very weak. The Guangdong and Hong Kong guilds handled more than 50 bales of Fugui Aizi fine twill and Dapeng Fugui fine cloth, and 40-50 boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, and printed goods. The Sichuan and Yunnan guilds have tight credit and lack wholesale transactions. Bulk transactions in colored cloth are common in Taizhou and other places in northern Jiangsu, with more than 1,000 pieces transacted. The Ningbo guild in eastern Zhejiang has approved two batches of imports, totaling nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, fine cloth, and group cloth. Various ports in eastern Zhejiang continue to ship small amounts of coarse cloth using sailboats. Foreign business is progressing quite well, with Singapore and Siam continuing to handle 1,000 several hundred pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and printed cloth. Shipments to Tianjin and Yantai in North China are also continuing.

Eastern Piece Goods

Yesterday, the momentum of white goods in the street showed slight activity, with more than 700 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill transacted. Therefore, the Longtou fine cloth has risen back to 13 yuan and 5 jiao. However, the prices of fine cloth and fine twill of each brand in the lower tier still have not improved. Selling pressure has gradually stabilized, and the downtrend has slightly subsided. Nissin Yoko Company will order more than 300 bales of Kaitou fine cloth, which are futures for July, with a price of 14 yuan per piece.

### Pullover Woolens, The True Face

True pullover woolens are specially ordered directly from foreign manufacturers by woolen cloth firms (a small number of upscale Western clothing stores also custom-order them). The patterns are usually one type per set. The amount is sufficient for "crown material", with each set being 3.25 yards. If you want to identify the authenticity of pullover woolens, just look at the yardage tag at the end of the set. Because the yardage tag is printed with the place of origin, factory name, place name, quantity, and number of the set.

Currently, the brands of pullover woolens in Shanghai include J&J Minnis, August Dormeuil & Cie, also known as ADC for short, George Roberts & Co, and Harding & Messenger. Some time ago, "Genbiao" pullover woolens were also popular for a time, but now the most fashionable, popular, and expensive should be a type of "Minnis". The "Dormeuil" products have a relatively long history of sales. Its George Roberts and Harding Messenger, etc., have only recently appeared in Shanghai.

The price of pullover woolens is mostly above 100 yuan per set. Those under 100 yuan are rare. Recently, since the exchange rate has shrunk greatly, it is no longer possible to purchase a set for less than around 200 yuan. (Jun)

### Grains, Flour Sales Are Sluggish, Factories Are Already Reducing Production, Only Japanese Merchants Are Buying Wheat

The flour market has not changed. Customer sales are still sluggish. In addition to a few sporadic embellishments in both the north and south, there has been no large-scale movement. As factories do not have hope of customer sales for the time being, and as it is hot summer, they have temporarily shut down some equipment in order to reduce production slightly. This is also subject to environmental control. Yesterday, the unified market trading still relied mainly on the street's retail sales. More than 10,000 bags of No. 2 flour of each brand were removed from the street and by traders from mainland guilds, at a price of 4.6 yuan in cash. The asking price for current Western flour is still 4.7 yuan in cash, but it is only a matter of asking without sales.

The wheat market continues to decline because shipments on the Shanghai-Nanjing route are gradually increasing. Chinese factories have been accumulating Western wheat for a long time because the sales of flour have been sluggish. There has been no formal intent to buy. In addition, another boat of Australian Western wheat is about to arrive, and people are becoming increasingly unsupported. Hoarders on the street rarely ask questions. Only the Japanese factories have been taking deliveries. A total of more than 1,500 bags of Nanjing, Wuhu, Changzhou, Danyang and other wheat were traded on the unified market, with prices ranging from 6.67 yuan to 5.58 yuan, which is a continuation of the decline of several points to about 1 jiao compared to the previous time.

### Round and Fine Rice: The Future Market Will Improve

Du Round Grain: Customer shipments, from He Xia, a total of more than 1,000 bags of Songjiang No. 5 were delivered to the Songjiang guild. Donglun Baozi is still coming from Fengjing. The early market opening showed that the street sales market was still sluggish. Mainland guilds did not move, resulting in a continued weak situation. The market for thick and thin round grain fell by another 0.2 jiao. But in the afternoon market, the price had fallen through. Suddenly, there was a move, and the market situation gradually became more active. Sellers had already started shouting prices high, but as a result, there was still no change.

Variant Yuan: Also continued to decline by 0.2 jiao. But because the market price was low, it has aroused inquiries.

Customer Fine Grain: After the opening of the market yesterday morning, customers' appetite for imports slackened, and reports that the place of origin was low and that it could be transported as usual. As a result, some wholesalers and traders were depreciating to sell, and then were affected by the wild crash of round grain. The market clearly showed a downward trend. All levels of high grain fell sharply, by as much as two, three or four jiao. Lodging decision makers were even weaker. Later, Hangzhou and other inland guilds took advantage of the opportunity to buy nearly 1,000 bags. The street countryside also slightly asked questions, and the market gradually stabilized. The total number of transactions throughout the day also increased to 3,000 bags.

### Oil Cake, Hankou Late Beans, Sold Open Yesterday, The First Time Since the War

Soybean market conditions: One, because it is currently the time of year when new crops are not yet available, and two, Dalian beans are subject to exchange rate controls, and commercial transportation is restricted, and the source is greatly affected. As a result, public sentiment is booming. The previous market (10th) saw all beans rise sharply by three, four, or five jiao. Yesterday, although traders from Changshu and the inner river district of the main street were still eager, the potential trend was already tending to level off. Statistics show that 14 cars of Dalian Siping Street were sold at 9.92 yuan, 9.95 yuan (goods are outside the warehouse, so they are cheaper because external fees must be added), and 10 yuan (goods are in this warehouse). 40 bags of Pudong Large Grain beans were priced at 11 yuan. More than 300 bags of Hankou Zha beans were priced at 9.1 yuan. Also, 350 bags of Hankou Late Beans were priced at 9.2 yuan. It is said that this Chenyun bean was the first to be listed since the war, and the goods were transported by Japanese merchants.

### Sugar Market: 3,000 Bags of Cart Red Transacted

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. According to Reuters dispatches, there was a slight decline. August at 7 shillings, 10 pence. December at 6 shillings, 3 pence. March of next year at 6 shillings, 4 pence. The public association's listed prices for spot 24 coarse whites were slightly loose. 29.8 jiao in this warehouse. 29.6 jiao outside the warehouse. 21.5 yuan for transshipment goods. Taikoo sugar had little change. Only H Mark cart red was transacted at 20.2 yuan for cash, a total of 3,000 bags. All others remained unchanged. After several days of sharp rises, the price of domestic sugar has been high and the market sentiment has gradually stabilized. Only a few dozen bags of superior white powder were opened yesterday at 29.5 yuan. The rest was just shouting prices.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Xuzhou Vegetable Ascends to New Levels, Excellent Body and Color, Sold for 40 Yuan

Xuzhou Daylily: Yesterday, I heard that 6 pieces of new goods from Shao Zijis Estate arrived, with excellent body and color, and were purchased by Guangdong guilds for 40 yuan. Check that the yield this year is very good, with dry bodies and bright colors, and everything. As the source of supply in northern Huai is blocked, the opportunity for these goods is quite good, and the large next batch will be arriving soon.

### Silk and Tea, Some Transactions in Tin Silk

Foreign Silk Market: Yesterday, there was nothing to speak of in terms of increase or decrease. The spot price in Yokohama was the same as the previous market. The long-term price was 1118 yuan. There have been no increases or decreases for several days. The recent price in New York rose by 1.5 fen. The long-term price remained unchanged. Spot prices all fell by 1 fen. Only 19 files were transacted in the New York silk market yesterday, only one-tenth of the heyday. The dull situation in the foreign silk market can be seen from this.

Local Silk Market: There were slight sporadic transactions in Wuxi silk, with no up or down in prices. In the local factory silk market, new silk has not yet been produced, and there are still many twists and turns in transportation prospects. Therefore, manufacturers generally do not sell off temporarily. Yesterday, only 30 dan of white factory silk and Jiaxing silk were transacted.

### Hardware, American Tinplate Sales Still Smooth

Trading in American tinplate has been smooth recently. Traders from Tianjin, Qingdao, Wenzhou, Yantai, and Fujian are showing vigorous appetites. Factories on this street are also actively purchasing. The main reason why this goods can be active in the market and not be crowded out by Japanese goods is that the quality of the goods is high, the color is dazzling, and the standards have to rise. Currently, the selling prices on the market are 38 yuan per picul for 18 to 24 gauge, 41 yuan for 26 gauge, and 43 yuan for 28 gauge. Other 48-sheet thin goods, 3.7 feet each, sell for 4.2 yuan per sheet, an increase of 6-7 yuan (per picul) and 6-7 jiao (per sheet) compared to the previous time. It is said that 2-300 bundles were opened yesterday.

### White Lead Wire Prices Are Also High

Recently, new spot white lead wire is extremely tight. General customers and factories are all actively dealing in white lead wire, and the standards have also been raised. The actual delivery side is satisfactory. Yesterday, about 5-600 piculs were opened, and the market price increased by 3-4 yuan. For example, No. 1 to No. 7 sells for 16 yuan, No. 8 to No. 13 sells for 18 yuan, and No. 14 to fine patterns sells for about 20 yuan. The unit is calculated per market picul. White lead wire such as No. 8 to No. 16 is 25.5 yuan, No. 16 to No. 20 is 30 yuan, and No. 21 to No. 25 is 50 yuan. Although the selling price is inferior to the golden age, it has risen appreciably compared to normal times.

### Coal, Indian Coal Falls Slightly

Since the exchange rate changes, Indian bituminous coal has been active at one time by local customers due to hoarding, but recently the doing price has become higher and higher, so that the running customers have withdrawn and the sales stomach is weak. The daily arrival of the cargo has become broader, and the market price has also dropped slightly. Yesterday, a certain firm opened, calculating the price of Indian unified coal at 46 yuan per ton, and screened blocks at 48 yuan. The colleagues from the warehouse themselves, the spot exchange transactions.

### Intelligence Widely Applied

— Geng Zhi

Everyone wants to be smart, intelligent, and wise, and no one wants to be foolish or stupid, because smart people benefit from everything, while stupid people always suffer losses, and everyone wants to gain advantages and avoid losses. Therefore, everyone wants to be smart, and if they are not smart, they want to study and even "create" intelligence. Since there is such a need for intelligence, perhaps broadening it—intelligence, another name for smartness—is not an unwise approach. However, I must state that what I mean by broadening is to add and replace things that go beyond what is generally considered smart. Therefore:

Starting from a person's childhood. In the past, the intelligence we knew in young children was proper behavior and politeness, or being able to recite poems and write verses, and being praised as child prodigies. Now, smart children are different: they can twirl guns, deceive people, have oily tongues, speak the slang of the urban lower class, curse, steal things from their homes and even from others, gamble, ...

In schools, whether elementary, middle, or high, the smart students we saw in the past were those with good grades and a solid foundation of knowledge. Even in the imperial examination era, the smart students valued were those who could write well and pass the exams based on genuine talent and learning. But now, things are different: First, as long as you have money, you can buy your way step by step to a foreign doctorate; genuine book learning is unnecessary, so the genius for intelligence is used for other things: asking classmates to "pass" during exams, copying, seeking favors from teachers, ... It is said that in some schools, one doesn't even need to attend classes to get semester grades and graduation grades. In some foreign schools, one doesn't even need to go to school to get their doctoral degrees, etc. These are, of course, good methods for smart students.

Once in society, new-style smart tricks are even more numerous. Summarizing them into principles, we have: Those who understand the times are heroes, a wise man avoids immediate losses, steer with the wind, bend one's arm inward, steal punches, benefit oneself at the expense of others, ... While the original concept of "a wise man is not perplexed," understanding reason, distinguishing right from wrong, and all the talents for managing the world and people, praised by ancient sages and worthies, are not included. What I admire most is their ability to feign foolishness, so-called "seeming foolish" or "seeming clumsy," which they readily display when it is disadvantageous to them. Because if they only had those "great wisdom" or "great skill" in mind but did not perform this "great wisdom" or "great skill," feigning foolishness, they would fail and find it difficult to succeed. Only because they can feign foolishness can people be deceived by them so they can carry out their tricks of substitution.

Of course, my intention is only to compare the so-called intelligence of the past and present, and to broaden its scope. I do not want to suppress one and promote the other, or belittle one and emphasize the other. If someone wants me to express some opinions, to test my degree of intelligence, then I must say that modern intelligence is suitable for the times. When everyone is drunk, it is enough to eat the dregs and sip the thin brew. Why be the only one awake, only to become an "Ah Q"! If you think this is not my heartfelt statement, I cannot convince you, because I am, after all, not a sage who can speak eloquently. But please look at their results, and you can believe it:

A child with modern widespread intelligence can gain the love of his parents, the praise of his relatives, and be praised as a good child, a promising talent, and a worthy son; a student with modern widespread intelligence can study effortlessly, steadily ascend to success, and obtain official ranks as easily as picking up mustard seeds. As for an adult with widespread intelligence in society, he can certainly establish a career, become a celebrity, a famous person, a wealthy man, or a high official, be admired by others, and feel that life has not been in vain. Look, aren't they all darlings of fortune, modern successful people? Then you can believe my admiration for them, because admiring successful people is a common practice for people of all ages, and I am not immune to this custom, so I have this heartfelt and sincere admiration. Because of this admiration, I wish everyone had this widespread intelligence, which shows my sincerity.

The difficulty is that, although such widespread intelligence can also be acquired through learning and cultivation, it is ultimately a difficult principle due to a person's unique endowment. Like me, my talent is much worse, even "a thousand thoughts" yield "no gain," so I can only watch others' "thousand thoughts" without "a loss," deeply envious. Unable to broaden myself, how can I broaden others? Perhaps what I have broadened is not worth a smile in the eyes of true intelligent people.

### Back to the Front Lines

— Li Yishan

### A Heartbreaking Story

— Sheng Dan

——War Zone Report

Returning to Shangcheng, I learned that Mr. Zhang Naiqi had already walked into Anhui. Perhaps the Dahua Hotel had handed in "Good Luck" and put up a "Full" sign. The manager expressed his apologies for not being able to accommodate us, which put us in a bit of a dilemma; because there was only half an hour left before curfew, if the overnight accommodation problem could not be solved, there would be no choice but to sleep on the street. Sleeping on the street was not a big deal, but Miss Wu and Little Shen both contracted malaria, and the quinine pills we had brought had all been given away along the way. As everyone was hesitating, Lao Yao suddenly found a familiar name on the guest list—Leng Jun, "Ah, Jun is also here, the problem is solved!" He was so excited he jumped up and down. So, led by the manager, we ran into the courtyard, through a dark alley, and indeed found that "fellow traveler" in room number fourteen.

"Why haven't you returned to Anhui yet?" Jun asked with a smile, but with a hint of surprise.

"Well, I've taken a big detour!" I replied simply.

Speaking of Jun, I thought of the story he told me in Hankou: After the morning moon over Lugou Bridge was swallowed by shadows, people immediately worried about the attitude of Han Fuqu, the governor of Shandong; that is to say, whether "Han Qingtian" could shoulder the responsibility of defending the territory and giving the southward invaders a head-on blow seemed to be an unpredictable mystery. At that time, he led the Second Propaganda Brigade to set out from Nanjing across the Yangtze River, heading north along the Pingpu Railway. When they arrived in Tai'an, the news of the abandonment of Dezhou was confirmed, and a telegram was sent refusing the propaganda team to enter Jinan. "Old Han is really unreliable." The facts proved his concerns, and they had to retreat to Xuzhou, join the First Brigade, and take the Longhai Railway to Zhengzhou. "Old Han himself is unwilling to fight, and he won't let others enter his defense zone. At this critical moment, he still has feudal territorial ideas and handed over Jinan with both hands. That fellow is really unbearable!" He said indignantly on the eve of "Han Qingtian"'s execution.

This time he was sent to western Anhui because it was "suitable for people and place." He was indeed a responsible fighter, "I will coexist with Lihuang!" he declared firmly. Until now, he had not left the great Dabie Mountains and had not abandoned his sacred work.

That night, we settled in the two patients and lay down on the floor; a large dilapidated room was divided equally among twelve people, and it was difficult not to mention stretching legs, even stretching the waist. "I heard that Liu'an has been contacted, do you know?" He opened the floodgates of conversation again, describing the situation around Dushan, and at the same time opened the map and studied it in detail. "Liu'an may not be easy to defend for long. As long as Mabao can be kept, if they continue to advance to the southeast, they will be throwing themselves into a trap!" he said, a satisfied smile flitting across his thin face. Everyone's spirits seemed to be reinvigorated, and I wrote a seven-character律 poem on his "National Provincial Fine Map":

The vast Yu city is boundless, a guest pondering over the map and scratching his head;

The northwest frontier is broken and sighed, and the southeast half is submerged again!

To resist the invaders, we must shed blood together; to defend the country is not merely like tasting gall;

We will see the day when we recover the capital and sing songs of triumph, and together we will go fishing by the river.

### Second Sweetheart

— Gong Chao

"Sweetheart" is a nickname for a lover; but now it has become the name of a transport vehicle.

Li Kaixing is a 22-year-old young man whose father is a wealthy businessman in Manila. Before the war broke out, he worked as a reporter for a Japanese newspaper, and in addition to his native language, he also spoke fluent English, Japanese, and French. After the July 7th Incident, he immediately resigned. In 1938, he returned to China with his like-minded friends and began his life as a transport vehicle driver in the Chinese army.

Their Philippine Chinese Overseas Battlefield Service Group consists of fifteen brave young members. Li Kaixing serves as the leader. Everyone comes from wealthy families, but they abandoned their lives of pleasure and drove transport vehicles, traveling back and forth in the war zone on the south bank of the Yangtze River, transporting military supplies to the front lines and sending the wounded back to the rear. They vowed to stay on the land of their motherland and continue this valuable work until the day of final victory.

Like all the members, Captain Li brought his own car back to the motherland. He cherishes this car as passionately and intimately as he cherishes a lover, often washing and repairing it himself, never entrusting it to others. He calls it "Second Sweatheart" (Second Sweetheart). One day, while they were racing on the front lines, they suddenly encountered a plane that chased them, bombing them with bombs and strafing them with machine guns. Li's car was hit with fifteen bullet holes. —And only fifteen bullet holes, nothing else was damaged. And Li Kaixing considered these fifteen bullet holes to be its most beautiful decorations.

Li's first sweetheart is his young and beautiful wife. He left her forty-four days after they got married and returned to his motherland to serve. This young captain received a monthly living allowance of sixty yuan, half of which he sent to his wife. He kept half for himself, but most of it was used to buy cigarettes. When he had to drive for hours in torrential rain or on pitch-black nights, cigarettes were his only good companion.

He is often on the road and cannot have regular three meals a day, so his toolbox is often filled with scattered food for occasional sustenance. Starving all day or not being able to rest for two or three nights in a row, such a life is very novel for this son of a wealthy businessman, and he is happy to live this life for the survival of his motherland.

After a year of service, not only Li's car had fifteen bullet holes, but the other fourteen cars were also covered in bullet marks. Fortunately, despite the constant bombing and strafing, only one of them was injured in the leg and was resting in a military hospital.

Their group is full of camaraderie. Whenever and wherever they hear a distress signal, everyone rushes to help. When they are on vacation, they are also the most active group, enthusiastically teaching Philippine folk songs, folk dances, and island games to their armed compatriots who are resting and recuperating in the headquarters or hospitals.

### Final Thoughts

— Editor

Yesterday's illustration "Mr. Earth in Encirclement" was upside down. We hereby correct it. However, in fact, "Mr. Earth" is indeed in a state of "being hung upside down and suffering," so this mistake may be excusable. A smile.

### Red Devil Vasika

— Written by Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou

"Are you going to hit me?" Asunnya asked him.

"Yes! I have to hit you..." Vasika said.

When they got to the kitchen, he ordered her to take off her clothes.

"Please don't hit me too hard..." Asunesnya pleaded.

"Humph, okay, okay..."

She took off everything but her shirt.

"Take it off!" Vasika ordered.

"What, aren't you ashamed!" She sighed and took off her outer garment.

Vasika whipped her shoulders.

"What do you want? Isn't it winter now?... I'll freeze to death..."

"I want you to freeze to death! Are you still dreaming?... "

He pushed her out of the kitchen door and whipped her. He whipped her to the gate, drove her to the yard, and ordered her to lie on the snowdrift.

"Vasya... really?"

"Quick, quick!"

Then he threw her face down in the snow, buried her head in the snow, muffled her cries, and whipped her for a long, long time, saying:

"Sleep, sleep, sleep..."

When he let her go, she was shivering with pain and cold, crying and regretfully saying to him:

"Look, Vasika! You'll fall into my hands,... then don't cry, Heaven has eyes! Vasika!

"Go ahead and wag your tongue!" He said indifferently.

"Don't you sleep in the parlor again! Then I'll drag you to the yard, throw you out, and pour water on your head..."

Life has its own intelligence, and that name is called "opportunity"! It often gives us many rewards. But even more common is revenge, just as the sun gives shadows to everything, the wisdom of life is always and everywhere ready to take revenge on everyone's actions. This is true, this is inevitable, and this is what we should all know and think about,... (6)

Old Newspaper Excerpts Sixty-Seven Years Ago (1878)

(From this newspaper in July of the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty)

### Situation of the Arsenal

It is heard that the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau has been ordered since the first three months to make shells, bombs, and all kinds of small firearms, etc., for the Westerners' Lai Fu, namely the rifled new cannons and the Krupp cannons and the Widget cannons. The projectiles used weigh forty pounds and twenty pounds respectively, and two hundred and five pieces can be cast every day. As for the gunpowder bureau, it is also able to serve the public to the best of its ability, and can manufacture one thousand five hundred pounds every seven days. It is also heard that the warships stationed at the Wusong estuary are all practicing daily, firing newly installed Krupp cannons. There is a Krupp cannon bureau where Westerners specially sent from Germany teach the boatmen of Feng and Shanghai warships, who are sent to Wusong in turns to learn. According to this method, everything is perfect! What is gratifying is that Western friends say that the Chinese already have methods for firing cannons.

### HSBC Bank Building

HSBC Bank in Shanghai has recently been thriving, and shareholders have profits to earn every year. Because the original site is narrow, a large building is now being built next to the new customs house on the Bund. Although the project has not yet been completed, its outline can already be seen. The building is three stories high, each floor is very high and large, and the interior rooms are also high, spacious and wide, very different from ordinary buildings. The outer brick pillars and verandas are decorated in a magnificent way, almost dazzling. This is indeed a novelty on the Bund! In the past, the houses of the Liru Bank were rich and magnificent, and the doors and windows were well-equipped and superior. The interior floor was smooth, and the equipment was neat, ranking first among the major buildings in Shanghai. After the HSBC building is completed, the houses of Liru will no longer be able to claim to be the best. It is heard that this house has cost six or seven thousand taels of silver, and the base of the American flag company has also paid sixty thousand taels. As for the interior decoration, it is not included in the count. However, the fact that this bank can spend so much silver is enough to show a glimpse of its affluence.

### YMCA Health Movement Week

— (New Dream)

A Death Certificate Represents a Greater Loss than War

Health Films Shown Every Night in the Gymnasium

The Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, as usual, holds a health movement every year. This time, a health education week was held again from the 10th, lasting seven days, and closing on the 16th. Indeed, people living in Shanghai, especially under today's circumstances, can avoid epidemics only if everyone pays attention to hygiene. Therefore, holding a public health movement to increase the general public's knowledge of hygiene has its important significance.

During Health Education Week, the YMCA uses various methods to increase people's knowledge of hygiene, so if you go to the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA these days, you can see pictures and slogans posted everywhere upstairs. How the human body is constructed, how terrible epidemics are, what are the vectors of infectious diseases, and what methods can people use to prevent infectious diseases? In addition to pictures, there are also slogans that are very vigilant, so that people can immediately understand the importance of hygiene upon seeing them.

Among many charts, what is particularly striking is a giant painting in the middle. In the center are words stating: "In Europe and the United States, the annual mortality rate is 15 per 1,000 people, while in China it is over 30. Calculating with a population of 400 million, the annual death toll should be over 6 million, the huge loss is more severe than any war. One person dying in vain causes the society to suffer economic losses. Averaging 500 yuan per person, the annual loss is 3 million yuan. This money can be used to start any of the following businesses: (1) Build 30,000 miles of railways; (2) Open 800 large factories; (3) Open 1,000 universities; (4) Open 100,000 elementary schools; (5) Open 5,000 hospitals; Build 600 urban waterworks projects; (6) Build 100,000 miles of asphalt roads. Surrounding it are pictures symbolizing the above-mentioned businesses. The scale of the loss is so huge, it is indeed alarming.

Besides upstairs, the four walls of the gymnasium also have various forms. During this Health Education Week, the YMCA also sent people to various neighborhoods to publicize health education, distribute leaflets, and hold health competitions. Every night, there are celebrity speeches and various entertainment performances, showing health films. The venue is in the gymnasium. Admission is free and admission tickets can be obtained from the association's office. On the first day of the opening, before seven o'clock, the gymnasium of the YMCA was already crowded. There were quite a few women, but the number of children was more than adults.

The lecture began at seven o'clock, and the speaker was Dr. Huang Zifang, whose topic was "Urban Life and Public Health." In his short speech, he explained very clearly how people in cities should pay special attention to hygiene issues, especially personal hygiene, and pointed out many methods of hygiene. After the lecture, female students from the Liangjiang and China Women's Physical Education Teachers College gave a physical education performance, among which mechanical performances and fire sticks were the most exciting. There were also Jewish refugee children performing solo dances and German exercises, which made people particularly sympathize with this group of small refugees who had recently escaped from Germany. Finally, two health films were shown, "The Structure of the Body" and "The Cleanliness of Clothes," which were specially made by Kodak. It is said that during this week, the entertainment programs and films are changed daily and are completely different. Such publicity for health education, benefiting the people, is naturally not small.

### Visit to the Sick Children's Experimental Class at Duncin Road First Refugee Children's School

— Mu Xu

Skin Disease Patients Account for About 20 Percent

Careful Medical Treatment for Recovery and Return to Original Class

This time I went to Duncin Road First Shelter to visit the "Shanghai Refugee Relief Association First Refugee Children's School" sick children's experimental class. This kind of facility that emphasizes children's health is very important and has the value of being introduced in an article.

The day I went to visit was in the afternoon. When the Principal Xu, who was thin and weak, led me into the classroom, a young teacher was telling the sick children about hygiene knowledge. Many hygiene posters and disease statistical charts were posted on the walls. They were all in high spirits and listening with great interest. Looking to the right, I knew that the classroom was arranged differently than usual. A space was separated by a blue curtain. "What's behind the curtain?" Under the leadership of the principal, I lifted the curtain and saw more than a dozen children, naked and unclothed, with pus-filled scabies on their upper bodies. A young female doctor, who was also a doctor in the small hospital in the shelter, was smiling and helping the sick children wash and treat their illnesses. Those sick children were about to recover. On their fair skin, there were still many scars from the scabies, showing the results of the treatment. There were also more than a dozen children with head lice, alternately washing their hair and applying medicine. I asked a ten-year-old sick child: "Has your skin disease gotten much better?"

"I've had scabies for a year and seven months," he replied with a smile, "Since entering the sick children's class and receiving daily medical treatment, the illness has decreased day by day, and the scabies has healed day by day. Mr. Zhu told me that it will be cured in another week." At that time, the principal took out a medical record sheet of the student for me to see, and the sheet showed the good results of gradual recovery. I couldn't help but feel happy for these sick children who suffered.

According to the principal, "This is the afternoon class of the sick children's experimental grade. There is also an early class from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM. There are more than 100 students in the two classes. These cured sick children will soon return to their original grades. One child who had scabies for nine years has now also been cured. Because their bodies have recovered their health, their studies have improved doubly, and their psychological hygiene has also improved rapidly. Recently, the number of students in the whole school has increased by more than 300 compared to when it opened. Those with skin diseases account for about 20 percent, and there are plans to add evening classes for sick children to meet the current needs and universally save suffering sick children."

In European and American countries, facilities that emphasize special education are valued. The open-air school selects children with weak bodies and minds, treats them, and teaches them at the same time. After their health is restored, they return to their original schools. The establishment of the school's sick children's class is comparable to an open-air school.

### Working in a Furnace Room in Summer

— A Whirlwind

Clothes as if soaked in a river

Head dizzy and swollen from the heat

A Silversmith Apprentice's Life Report

I get up at 5 o'clock, and looking at the thermometer, the mercury column is stuck at 90 degrees. There isn't even a trace of breeze around, knowing that today's weather will be terribly hot.

After hurriedly finishing the work that an apprentice should do, I ran to the masters' bedroom to change into old, patched blue cloth short shirt and trousers, and picked out a few bright red collar buttons. "It's so hot, smelting gold, starting the furnace, it's really troublesome!" The fat Ningbo gentleman sleeping on the bed looked at me, and his eyes seemed to sparkle with endless pity and compassion.

I smiled and quickly slipped into the furnace room. After shoveling out the ashes and charcoal, I immediately started the stove. The raging fire shone through the charcoal piled up like hills, illuminating the room that was over ten feet wide. When all the charcoal was burning and glowing red, I poured the hot charcoal from the pot to one side, and then placed the pot in the center of the charcoal.

About two hours later, the pot turned red, and our work – smelting gold – officially began. The bellows started to be pulled with a whooshing sound, and a huge fire surged up again, emitting a brilliant light. The bluish-purple flames closely followed the pillar of fire, jumping very high and long from time to time. The cold charcoal suddenly encountered a strong force and exploded with cracking sounds, with sparks flying everywhere. The face, hands, and chest could all be attacked by it at any time.

When the pot was red and transparent, the golden gold was poured in batches. Then, I used all my strength to pull the huge bellows rapidly, and the whooshing sound vibrated my eardrums and dazed my mind.

Turning the gold into liquid with extremely high heat, needless to say, our skin was smoked by the flames, and each pore felt like it was exploding, even swelling up. Because of working so hard, our clothes were like being soaked in the river. The sweat on our foreheads dripped down like rain. After wiping it away, more sweat welled up, so we had to let it be. I pulled the bellows hard, and even though my mind was dizzy and swollen, I couldn't relax even a little. Otherwise, the gold would break the pot and leak out. This hidden debt has always been considered the most terrible punishment by us; it makes us obediently work hard to smelt the gold. We smelt pot after pot, and when we saw that there was still a lot of gold that hadn't been melted, although ten thousand flames were rising in our hearts, we worked even harder.

When I walked out of the furnace room after smelting the gold, even standing in the scorching sunlight, I felt infinitely cool. Imagine going from a furnace room with hundreds of degrees to a natural environment of a hundred degrees, how could that not be considered extremely happy? Who would still be complaining about the heat there?

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 14: Thousands of Homes in the Countryside Cooperate, Myriad Miles of Waves for Overseas Flight

Let's talk about Village Chief Zhu accompanying the two Miss He's, and Lover and Beloved, etc., coming from the Provincial 13th Seed Manufacturing Institute. The sky was already getting dark. Shuangquan and the others did not plan to stay in Freedom Village this time, but instead followed Zhu Lover back. They would come to Freedom Village again next Sunday. If Lover had time next Sunday, they would still come in her car together. If she was busy, it didn't matter. Her sisters could also come, because there was a public bus from Anle Town to Freedom Village, which made it very convenient to travel back and forth. Moreover, He Qiyu and her sisters had learned to drive in the United States before, but they were not as skilled as Zhu Lover and Jin Danyu. After returning to China, because their family hired a chauffeur, they didn't drive much, so they were getting rusty. When they came to this place and saw that many sisters were driving themselves, they thought that they would need a car to start a factory here in the future, and driving themselves would be more convenient. Therefore, they also wanted to learn to drive. They already knew how to drive, and they would be able to drive well after practicing with Lover's car a few times. Recently, many girls have been learning to fly airplanes, and driving cars should be even more popularized. At that time, they returned to Village Chief Zhu's home. Mrs. Zhu wanted to keep them for dinner before they went back. But Village Chief Zhu said, "Since they are not staying here, let them go back earlier! Next week, they can see the equipment in our new village. This is a new village built from scratch. We can't say how it will develop, but we just want to do it step by step within this small scope. I hope every village will be like this." Originally, with a future like Freedom Village, he was not worried that it would not prosper, but only afraid that it would not be able to be organized and complete. Village Chief Zhu wanted to maintain that good rural custom. Therefore, whenever a family moved to Freedom Village, they had to go through several inspections before they were allowed to come. First, if they were unemployed, only relying on some property as a property-owning class, living only by sitting and eating, they would not want them to come. Even if they were employed, they would also have to examine what kind of profession they had. If they were engaged in the kind of luxurious profession in big cities, they would not want them to come either. Their Freedom Village had the regulations of Freedom Village. Only those who could abide by the regulations of their village would be considered their villagers. If they violated the regulations of their village, they would be warned and punished for minor offenses, and asked to move out of Freedom Village for major offenses. Because the people living in Freedom Village all had the freedom endowed by nature. If you violated the regulations and harmed other people's freedom, they would not be polite and would teach you to lose your freedom as well. (157)

### A General Review of Hou Yulan (Part 2)

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

The Conclusion is "Undoubtedly a Star"

Yulan's grades at school were very good (grades are the overall average of drama, practice, literature, and conduct). From the first semester of the 24th year to the first semester of the 27th year, in the seven semesters of examinations, Yulan was ranked first in the first class four times, and the rest were all within the top five. Because of her diligence in learning, her inquisitiveness, her pure interests, and her upright character, teachers and classmates alike all valued her. After graduation, she was hired by the drama school as a teaching assistant and stayed at the school to participate in practical performances. When Xiao Bo formed a troupe, he specially invited her to cooperate and co-star, and the theater was always full, and her reputation rose. Her first collaboration with Xi was "Wu Jia Po" from Wang Baochuan, and Ling Xiao Hange specially went to see it and wrote a short commentary, which read:

"Hou Yulan has a broad voice and sings delicately, with an extraordinary air. This time, she is like Zhuge Liang's first accomplishment when he first came out of the thatched cottage, with a great future. When the applause resounded upstairs and downstairs, she clasped her hands together and paid tribute to the audience for thirty minutes, wishing this 'Lady Marquis' a speedy promotion to 'Great King'."

After Yulan joined an outside troupe, Liu Butang, a Pingju critic in the old capital, had two thoughts:

"For the past twenty years, the leading role of female Dan has undoubtedly been led by Mei, with Cheng and Xun assisting her, forming the situation of the Four Famous Dans. Now that the four are getting old, whether the so-called Four Little Famous Dans can inherit their mantle is still uncertain. At this time, Hou Yulan, a top student from the drama school, emerged.

What kind of talent Hou has, there is already a consensus in society. Considering her personal diligence, frugality, filial piety, and humility, she is truly a reason for her future success. Writing to this point, I have two thoughts: (1) I sweat for the current so-called Four Little Famous Dans. (2) Who will inherit the throne of the Dan world after Mei and others in the future, a man or a woman? And there will be a value of questioning with Meng Xiaodong's talent." Yulan has a simple and honest nature, and is innocent and lively. She is filial in everything she does. She treats people honestly and uprightly, and is polite. She lives frugally and does not pursue fashion. After graduation, no one has ever come to her door to woo her, but the newspapers still praise her without any criticism, which shows that justice is in people's hearts and sets a new record for female actors. This time, Yulan was hired to come to Shanghai, and Ling Xiao Hange gave her a farewell message:

"...I hope that she will find an actor partner in the future and dedicate her life to drama. Like the example of Xi Caiyun, the husband and wife sing together, or the wife sings and the husband follows."

After Yulan took the stage, I have watched her plays twice: one was "Selling Horses" and the other was "Si Lang Visits His Mother". Her singing, recitation, expression, as well as her hand gestures, body movements, and steps, all meet the conditions of a famous actor. "Selling Horses" was especially satisfactory. I now echo the words of my old friend Mr. Su Shaoqing and say: "This person is undoubtedly a star!"

Random Notes of an Artist

### Trip to the Philippines (Part 2)

— Zhou Xuan

The city of the island is very clean, and coconut trees dot the beautiful scenery everywhere. The impression can be said to be very good, but the climate is really too hot. Our entire group of members all lived in the theater. During the day, it was simply too hot to go out. The daily performances were only one show from 8 pm to 10 pm. The only special thing in our lives was that we had to rinse our bodies with cold water several times a day from morning to night, otherwise we would get sick.

There are many overseas Chinese here, mostly from Fujian and Guangdong. There are also many shops opened by people from a certain country; however, the overseas Chinese are very enthusiastic and absolutely do not go there to shop. If someone rashly lost sight and ran in, it would immediately attract the attention of passers-by, who would write a note to politely dissuade them. If the person admitted their mistake, it would be fine; otherwise, if it was announced in the newspaper the next day, it would be a great disgrace that was difficult to face. Many of our partners knew that they were unfamiliar with the place, so when they wanted to go out to buy things, they were very wary and had to be guided by others.

The entire island area is very small – it doesn't seem as large as the Shanghai Public Concession. On a road called "American Street," there are as many as seven or eight high-end foreign movie theaters. There are also two theaters showing domestic films, "Central" and "Asia". Many new Shanghai productions are shown very early. The city's transportation includes no trams, very few cars, and mostly horse-drawn carriages, which are very cheap; for just five cents, you can go anywhere. In the evening, when the sea breeze was blowing, I liked to take a horse-drawn carriage along the coast.

The place where we performed was the Asia Grand Theatre. This period was the end of the lunar new year. Ticket prices were one dollar and fifty cents, and it was crowded every day. The performance program stipulated ten kinds of performances every day, and they were changed every three days. The last show was my drama. This place is ruled by the United States. Fortunately, during the performance period, we performed for nine lunar months. The patriotism of the overseas Chinese is truly extremely enthusiastic. Every time there was an impassioned performance or a national flag was raised, there was thunderous applause and a frenzy of cheering. We were therefore particularly excited on stage, to the point of being unable to hold back our tears. Because the climate was too hot, this life was really unbearable. After performing for two months, we were all eager to return to Shanghai. I know that I am too young and have not experienced much, but I have one feeling, which is that overseas direct transmission is a very urgent task.

### MGM's Twenty-Six Pillars Title Record

— Fengxiang

MGM Pictures is a well-known brand in Hollywood. It not only has a long history, and is estimated to be the number one "Big Brother" in Hollywood, but also has a very strong cast of actors. There are as many as twenty-six who are well-known on the screen and have been promoted as pillars of the company, which can truly be called "a gathering of talents."

Now, let's list their names below, in alphabetical order by last name: Fred Astaire, Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery, Eddie Cantor, Joan Crowford, Robert Donat, Nelson Eddy, Clark Gable, Greta Garbo, Hedy Lamarr, Myrna Loy, Jeanette MacDonald, the Marx Brothers, Robert Montgomery, Eleanor Powell, William Powell, Mickey Rooney, Rosalind Russell, Norma Shearer, Margaret Sullavan ("The Shopworn Angel" female lead), Robert Taylor, and Spencer Tracy.

The above list already has twenty-five people. There is also the male lead of "The Shopworn Angel", which is currently being shown at the South Cinema, whose name is James Stewart. MGM recently raised his status and made him one of the pillars.

### Harmonica Bands in Shanghai

— Li Xinwu

One of the Historical Materials of the Harmonica Circle

The harmonica, after being promoted by several famous players, has attracted many young people. Shanghai can be said to be the birthplace of harmonica music in China. Over the years, many talents have emerged, and harmonica performances can be heard everywhere. Among them, there are many harmonica bands that play together, imitating the organization of a large orchestra and playing the music of a large orchestra, which not only reveals the value of art, but also demonstrates the spirit of cooperation. Although the power of expression is ultimately small, everything starts from small, and they are shouldering the mission of promoting and carrying forward.

In Shanghai, the best harmonica band is the Fudan University Harmonica Band, which was around 1929. The second best is the China Harmonica Band. In the next five years, more and more talents emerged, and the YMCA's Dahua Harmonica Band, as well as the Guangming and Qingguang Bands, were established one after another. There are countless other small bands. However, that was still in the budding stage, and everything was very immature. It was not until the recent three to five years that there was rapid progress, and those outdated harmonica bands were gradually eliminated. Currently, there are four harmonica bands on this island that are larger in scale and have a more refined lineup. They each have considerable status and reputation, and they are all progressing. Here, it is worth talking about their general situation:

(1) China Harmonica Band

It has the oldest qualifications, with nearly ten years of history. It has gone through many vicissitudes, but it has still been able to exist, which is very rare. The instructors are the Wang brothers, a pair of harmonica experts whose names are unknown. There are a large number of students. There are currently about twenty to thirty basic members. As for the attached members, they are further divided into five teams: A, B, C, D, and women's, with a total number of more than one hundred. In addition to various sizes of harmonicas as the main body, the orchestra also includes large double basses, accordions, six small drums, timpani, and other instruments. The completeness of the organization is unmatched by other teams.

(2) Public Harmonica Band

It is the incarnation of the once-popular YMCA Dahua Harmonica Band, affiliated with the Public Harmonica Association, and led by Shi Renwang, a very famous harmonica player in Shanghai. It has been around for more than three years, and there are also quite a few members. Because of "My Lord Jesus," Shi occupies a strong position in church groups. A special feature of his team is that there is a large hanging hand piano to accompany them, which can show the beauty of harmony when playing sacred music.

(3) Shanghai Harmonica Band

Affiliated with the Shanghai Harmonica Association, it is the reorganization of the former Greater Shanghai Harmonica Band, led by Chen Jianchen. This team is smaller in scale, but the spirit of the entire team is excellent, and everyone is willing to work hard. Its style is completely in the original style of the China Harmonica Band in the early days, which may be because the leader came from China. Recently, the team has also been thriving.

(4) China United Harmonica Band

Affiliated with the China United Recreational Association, its members are all excellent members from the above teams, so the lineup is extremely strong. The instructor is Yu Yuxing, a very famous figure in the harmonica circle, but he is a "pessimistic" young man. He needs to be excited before he can lead his team to make great strides. The China United Harmonica Band is supported in this situation. This team is a purely amateur organization, and it can also be said to be a gathering place for celebrities in Shanghai. It is a pity that the organization is too loose. If it is revitalized, it will definitely be able to overwhelm everything.

Not long ago, several leading figures in the harmonica circle launched a joint viewing meeting for all harmonica bands in Shanghai, with no fewer than two or three hundred attendees. I think that if so many masters were to hold a charity united concert, it would definitely be a sensation. I wonder if the harmonica masters would be willing to create benefits for the suffering compatriots?

### Silver Screen News

— Silver Thread

Bu Wancang is preparing for the filming of the "Ding Shi" costume drama these days, and is very busy. The props for this film are designed by Hu Xuguang, and the costumes are designed by Lu Shihou, and they are all being processed. The seedlings that were planted in the pond before have now grown tall and graceful. In another month, the lotus flowers will be in full bloom, and this outdoor scene can be filmed.

The second costume film of China Film Company, "Wang Baochuan", has been partially filmed. The scenery is extremely gorgeous. The artist plans to complete this film before the Mid-Autumn Festival, so that it can be released during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

The name of "Desperado", directed and starred by Wang Yin, has been decided and will not be changed. Seven or eight tenths of the film has been completed. It is said that it will be listed as a production of Huacheng Film Studio, and will meet the audience at the Grand Theatre.

Chen Yunang set off for Shanghai on the 22nd. In Hong Kong, Chen wrote a long autobiographical article for the Zhujiang Daily, called "Reminiscences of the Past", which was published daily. Some newspapers in Shanghai also reprinted it.

Qiu Yun joined Xinhua. The first play was originally "The Flying Corpse of Lan Mu", directed by Xu Xinfu. Now, because Qiu Yun is in Guohua and is filming "Little Swordswoman" (starring with Hu Rongrong), she is not able to divide herself for the time being. Therefore, there is another rumor that the heroine of "The Flying Corpse of Lan Mu" will be replaced.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Xu Biyun Violates the Taboo of the White Tiger in the Pear Garden

His appearance was not very beautiful, especially his eyebrows and eyes had a murderous aura, and he had no charming appearance for playing the female Dan role. However, he was still young at the time, and he was not addicted to bad habits. In addition, he had several fashionable and beautiful outfits. Therefore, it was not difficult to look good when he walked out of the room. At that time, in addition to the Four Famous Dan, he was the most promising male Dan. Whether he performed in Pingjin or Shanghai, he could get good reviews. In addition to his good plays such as "Green Pearl", he also had "The Complete Jade Hall Spring", which competed with Xun Huisheng. He was also very much in the limelight for those few years.

Experienced people often say that there are both advantages and disadvantages in everything. Advantages and disadvantages are always connected. Biyun's popularity was mostly due to Meng Jun's support, who provided him with money to spend. However, his downfall and his current slump are also somewhat related to Meng. It can be seen that if an artist does not think about his own art, does not seek the general praise of society, but only relies on the praise and support of a few members of the bourgeoisie, then that time is the shortest and the most affects the development of his personal future. According to reports, Meng was the richest man in Dongwei County. There were many people in the clan, but they had not yet separated. Northerners have always attached great importance to several generations living under one roof, so the Meng family did not want to be an exception. Their patriarch had a unique perspective, so the family rules he established were also very special. All the children of the clan were not allowed to engage in prostitution or gambling. Those who violated this would be severely punished. However, they not only did not prohibit the smoking of opium, but also encouraged it. Every three to five days, they would cook hundreds of taels of opium and place it in a large vat. All the children of the clan would take small porcelain jars and receive opium paste from the cashier according to the household. The cashier was like an old slave of the opium den. (57)

### Trends of Actors

Kun Dan, Qiu Yunyan, follows Jin Biyan. The Jin Bi Yan couple learn art, with great progress. Recently, the Modern Drama Theatre once invited her, but her parents politely declined. This beauty is planning to travel north for further study. Du Juchu has contacted Liu Zhenting and intends to invite her to Ping for performances, with a profit-sharing system. Liu is still considering.

Liu Hanchen is currently working hard on compiling private plays. His masterpiece is "Red Dust Swordsman". The first two volumes have been performed in Tianjin. Volumes nine and ten have recently been completed, but the title pages have not yet been completed. When the weather is slightly cooler, he will re-edit volumes eleven and twelve, whether it will be leaked and performed is undecided.

Musician Xuan Dingyi has recently been composing songs for the film Wen Suchen, which is very laborious. According to him, the film plans to shoot two volumes first, and the first volume has already been filmed. It is scheduled to be screened in Shanghai during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The theater has not yet been decided.

Appendix: Because of the backlog of endgame drafts, we stopped publishing the games of famous players. Recently, we received letters from readers requesting us to continue publishing and asking the editor to add comments for research purposes. It is very difficult to comment on the games of famous players, because they are already famous players and must have considerable qualifications. The moves and steps each have their own mysteries. Winning is certainly gratifying, and losing is also worth learning from. We must not judge them by winning or losing, but must examine how the situation is conceived and how the application is skillful, and then add comments to get the essence of it. Therefore, commenting on the games of famous players requires considerable expertise, otherwise one will inevitably be ridiculed for showing off one's skills. The editor should follow the request of the readers and add comments, intending to conduct joint research. If there is anything inappropriate, I hope that experts will correct me.
