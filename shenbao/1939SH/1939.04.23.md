### The Smooth Progress of the Cantonese-Chinese Army's Counteroffensive: Guangzhou is Completely Surrounded; Chinese Slogans Discovered in the City Stating the Provincial Capital Will Soon Be Recaptured; Over Two Thousand Japanese Soldiers Killed at the Three Locations of Shikkeng, Dongdong, and Paitan; An Entire Japanese Company Annihilated Near Liu Zhuang in Jiangxi

(Hong Kong) Foreign Dispatch: The hope of the Chinese army to recover Guangzhou has been increasing daily. Zengcheng has now been recaptured, and Conghua to the north has also been recovered in succession. The situation has greatly improved. Consequently, the Chinese army has completed a semi-circular encirclement of Guangzhou from the mouth of the Dongjiang River in the south to the Yuehan Railway in the north. Chinese artillery has also recently demonstrated great power. According to news this morning, the Japanese army has retreated to Guangzhou in unprecedented panic. Jiangmen is currently surrounded by the Chinese army on three sides. (Special dispatch at 10 PM on the 22nd)

(Guangzhou) Last night, there was significant military activity in Guangzhou. Hundreds of military trucks continuously passed through Shaqi Road heading towards Huangsha Railway Station. This morning, several thousand soldiers, carrying machine guns and light artillery, passed in front of Shamian. At the same time, people secretly posted notices in the streets of Guangzhou, announcing that the Chinese army would soon capture the provincial capital. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)

Wengyuan: On the 16th, 17th, and 18th, the Chinese army killed over two thousand Japanese soldiers in the three battles of Shikkeng, Dongdong, and Paitan, and seized countless military supplies. (Dispatch on the 22nd)

Wengyuan: Guangzhou's financial situation is becoming increasingly chaotic due to the Chinese army's continuous counteroffensive. The value of Japanese military notes has plummeted. (Dispatch on the 22nd)

Wengyuan: At noon on the 20th, three Japanese motorboats, carrying 200 Japanese soldiers, landed and harassed areas such as Nantou, Shekou, and Shanhouhai south of Bao'an City. They were met with a fierce attack by the Chinese local forces, and they retreated in disarray along their original route back to their ships. (Dispatch on the 22nd)

(Chongqing) According to today's military news from the Chinese side, the Chinese army's counteroffensive in South China is still progressing smoothly, with the force of an autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. Over a thousand Japanese soldiers in the Paitan area were completely defeated as a result of a surprise flanking attack by the Chinese army. Xinhui has also been captured by the Chinese army. The Chinese army is now poised to launch a strong assault on Guangzhou. Therefore, Japanese reinforcement troops are now concentrated around Guangzhou to resist the Chinese army's advance. (Associated Press dispatch on the 21st)

(Chongqing) According to today's report from the Chinese front in South China, the Chinese army used heavy artillery to bombard Conghua, and finally recaptured the city yesterday. All the Japanese soldiers defending the city were defeated. (Note: This city is thirty miles from Guangzhou.) At the same time, Paitan, fifteen miles east of Conghua, has also been captured by the Chinese army. The Japanese army retreated towards Taipingchang and Shengang. Six hundred Japanese soldiers were killed and two hundred were wounded. According to the Chinese military authorities, the Chinese general counteroffensive has not yet begun. The reports from Tokyo are absolutely inaccurate. Although the Chinese army has been operating very smoothly in recent battles, the military strategy adopted by the Chinese army is to lure the Japanese army into the mountainous areas, so that the Japanese army's superior weapons are of no use. The Chinese army will not begin the general counteroffensive until all the Japanese army has been lured into the mountainous areas. In the past twenty days, the Chinese army has recovered more than seventy important points, including Zengcheng in Guangdong Province and Nangong in Hebei Province. The victory of the Chinese army this time is clear evidence of the Chinese army's strong morale and the gradual decline of the Japanese army's strength. According to them, the Chinese army's recent victory is not the result of the general offensive in April, but only a prelude to the general counteroffensive. (Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd)

Dongxiang: The Chinese troops who crossed the Fuhe River from Wubin, "nine kilometers east of Liantang," once approached Liantang Railway Station.

(Hong Kong) According to today's report from the Chinese side, the Chinese army advancing on Guangzhou from the southwest and northwest has created a ninety-mile front, forming a semi-circle from the north bank of the Dongjiang River through Zengcheng on the Yuehan Railway. The Chinese side stated that as a result of recent operations, the Chinese army has recovered fifty square miles around Guangzhou, including more than five hundred villages and millions of people. The Chinese army has indeed occupied the entire Kowloon Peninsula south of the Dongjiang River, except for the area near Dongguan along the south bank of the Dongjiang River, where the Japanese army is protected by the cannons of Japanese warships. At present, the Chinese army is only twenty miles from Guangzhou. It is reported that a Chinese army unit has advanced along the Yuehan Railway to a place only ten miles from Guangzhou. Fierce battles are currently taking place between the Dongjiang River and Zengcheng and Conghua. The Chinese army claims to have occupied sixty-five miles of the Yuehan Railway. According to well-informed Chinese sources here, regardless of whether the Chinese army recovers Guangzhou, the success of the Chinese army's offensive has made it impossible for the Japanese army to immediately attack Guangxi. According to the Central News Agency, Japanese reinforcements are rushing to Shitan to prepare for a counteroffensive against the Chinese army in the Zengcheng and Shilong area. The Chinese army's position west of Zengcheng is solid. (Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd)

### The Chinese Army in Eastern Henan Once Again Charged into the West Gate of Kaifeng; Japanese Military Warehouses Were Completely Burned Down; Fierce Fighting Unfolded in Counties Such as Minquan and Lanfeng

(Luoyang) The Chinese army in eastern Henan launched a third attack on Kaifeng at 2 AM on the night of the 20th. Although the Japanese army was heavily guarded, they were ultimately unable to stop the Chinese army's brave and fearless charge. After a fierce battle, the Chinese army occupied the railway station and the west gate, among other places. All the Japanese military warehouses at the railway station and the west gate were set ablaze by the Chinese army. The flames soared into the sky. By dawn, the Chinese army had achieved its goal of attacking and destroying, and retreated safely. In this battle, over 200 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese suffered even greater losses. The Chinese army has attacked Kaifeng three times in two weeks, causing the Japanese army to be unable to rest easy. (Dispatch on the 21st)

(Luoyang) Starting from the 18th, the county magistrates of the counties in eastern Henan led local forces, along with various guerrilla units, to simultaneously attack the Japanese army in Qixian, Tongxu, Chenliu, Minquan, Kaocheng, and Lanfeng counties, and to destroy transportation routes. According to reports received from various counties, fierce fighting has broken out near each county. The Japanese army is unable to respond due to being held back by the Chinese army. (Dispatch on the 21st)

(Luoyang) A Japanese force of about 1,000 men near Youtan Town north of Kaifeng was suddenly attacked by a certain Chinese army unit on the 17th, taking advantage of their unpreparedness.

(Luoyang) The Japanese army in North China recently ordered the suspension of passenger transport on the Pinghan and Zhengtai Railways for three weeks. During this period, they will transport large numbers of Japanese and puppet troops transferred from the three northeastern provinces to reinforce Kaifeng and Taiyuan. This proves the significant threat that the Chinese army has posed to the Japanese army since the counteroffensive began in Henan and Shanxi. The Japanese army, exhausted and depleted, has had no choice but to transfer troops from the Northeast for reinforcement, demonstrating their predicament. (Dispatch on the 21st)

(Peiping) According to a statement released by the Japanese military spokesman last night, the fighting in the Kaifeng area has been very intense this week. The Chinese army is apparently trying to reoccupy Kaifeng. On April 19, 2,000 Chinese guerrillas engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army northwest of Kaifeng. The next morning, the Chinese army attacked the Kaifeng airfield and railway station. It is claimed that the Chinese army attacking Kaifeng has been pushed back to the Lanfeng area by the Japanese counterattack, and that the 8th Route Army's branch detachment there has been scattered. It is also said that the Guihua Railway east of the Pingsui Railway has been cut off by the Chinese army since April 17, so there has been fierce fighting there in recent days. In the past two days, there has also been heavy fighting in the Guyang area northwest of Guihua. At the same time, the Chinese army in Zhongmu southeast of Kaifeng was cleared by the Japanese army on April 19. (Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd)

Over 120 Japanese officers and soldiers were killed or injured. (Dispatch on the 22nd)

### The Battle for Wuning

(Changsha) (Continued from Yesterday) The Japanese army's attack, with such heavy casualties in this small area, was driven by savage impulses. From the 21st, they specialized in bombing with aircraft and artillery, and using poison gas. The infantry also strongly crossed the Botian River to invade westward, especially on the 26th. On that day, the Japanese army attacked several times under heavy artillery fire, but were met with our strong resistance, suffering heavy casualties. The poison gas shells fired by the Japanese army were not easily activated, and few of our soldiers were poisoned. On the 27th, the Japanese army sent planes to distribute absurd leaflets. Subsequently, the Japanese infantry and artillery, totaling approximately four regiments, began attacking us again. The scope of the battle shifted to our positions, the Zhuning Highway, and the west bank of the Botian River. Our army displayed astonishing courage, launching repeated counterattacks, countless times. Every hill and every high ground was defended until the last man and the last bullet, never giving up. At dusk, due to excessive casualties, the battlefield commander decisively made a desperate move, concentrating the remaining forces and launching a swift assault on the point where the Japanese army was attacking, engaging in close combat. After two days of fierce fighting, on the morning of the 29th, our army gradually withdrew from the city walls of Wuning and switched to defending the northwest high ground, continuing the battle. The Japanese army, after seizing Wuning City, deeply felt the magnitude of their sacrifices and admired our army's courage. They only briefly fled westward to Putian Bridge, thirty li from the city, and dared not advance further. Starting from the 14th of this month, our army, taking advantage of the Japanese army's incomplete replenishment, launched a fierce counteroffensive, dividing into two routes to counterattack Wuning from both banks of the Xiu River, making rapid progress. They occupied Putian Bridge and on the 19th, pursued again, recovering important mountainous areas in the four surrounding areas of Wuning. The city walls of Wuning, located in the basin, were within our encirclement and observation. We could take them at any time. At the same time, since we recovered the mountainous areas surrounding Wuning, we still obtained the ability to continue driving a wedge into the Gan-E (Jiangxi-Hubei) trunk line in a flanking posture, causing the core of the enemy forces invading the Gan border to become inflexible and even collapse. Although the Japanese army paid a heavy price to temporarily occupy the city walls of Wuning, they were ultimately unable to occupy the mountainous areas in the four surrounding areas. Their desire to remove the threat of the wedge core was endless. Therefore, the focus of the battle for Wuning lies in the mountains and not in the city. We have already achieved the initial phase of the battle. (Dispatch on the 22nd)

The Chinese army rose up with divine courage, braved the poison gas to launch an attack, and engaged the Japanese army in close combat. The sounds of killing shook the sky. The fighting raged until 1 PM, when the entire Japanese line wavered and retreated northward. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy casualties in this battle. Japanese corpses littered the vicinity of Caopi. The Chinese army is clearing the battlefield.

Editorial

### The Future of Japan's Deficit Finance

Japan's financial deficit is growing larger and larger with the expansion of the war of aggression against China. By the end of last year, the total amount of national debt had reached more than 17.8 billion yen. This is almost an average burden of 255 yen for every citizen, exceeding their average annual income. The estimated military expenditure for the war of aggression against China this year is more than 6 billion yen, of which more than 5 billion yen will have to rely on raising public debt. It is reported that 300 million yen of public debt will be issued on the 25th of this month: 100 million will be purchased by the Bank of Japan, and 200 million will be absorbed by the Ministry of Finance's Reserve Fund Department. The funds of the Ministry of Finance's Reserve Fund Department are all collected from the small savings of the lower and middle classes. In other words, Japan is using the savings of the lower and middle classes as war expenses. If this continues, the bankruptcy of the entire financial economy is only a matter of time. This is the harvest of China's 22 months of resistance.

Although Japan claims to be an emerging industrial country, most of its industrial base is built on light industry, and all industrial raw materials must be supplied from abroad. Therefore, it is always a very poor country. If it is forced to bear huge expenditures, it will inevitably lead to the bankruptcy of its financial economy. Therefore, in the past, when Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who was a financial expert, and Minister of Finance Takahashi, also a financial expert, were in office, they tried their best to economize on national expenses and limit the excessive expansion of military and political expenses. Unfortunately, the Japanese militarists only knew how to expand their power and ignored the interests of the country. After murdering Hamaguchi and Takahashi, they launched the war of aggression against China. They believed that aggression against China could achieve a "victory without resistance", and that all or part of China would be under Japan's control, so as to obtain abundant industrial raw materials and a vast commodity market. In this way, their power would be easily expanded, and the difficulties of Japan's financial economy could be solved. However, their military gamble has encountered strong resistance from China, and their financial economy has fallen into an even more frightening abyss due to the persistence of the war, from which they cannot extricate themselves.

National debt is to be shared by the broad masses of the people. Today, the national debt owed by the Japanese people has exceeded their average annual income, and their military aggression against China has fallen into a dilemma. In order to save this military crisis, the Japanese militarists will naturally engage in even more reckless and extensive aggression, so the increase in war expenses will inevitably increase with each passing day. However, in wartime Japan, except for the military industry, all industries are depressed, and more than 26,000 small and medium-sized enterprises have gone bankrupt. Prices are soaring, and national income has declined, making it difficult to maintain life. How can there be surplus power to digest the national debt? Therefore, the Hiranuma cabinet, which has always followed the lead of the militarists, had to implement Article 11 of the National Mobilization Law, and gamble the entire national fortune of Japan for the militarists.

According to the provisions of Article 11 of the National Mobilization Law, the government can restrict the dividends of all enterprises by law and force them to purchase national debt. However, most of the enterprises have no much profit due to the impact of the war. If the government wants to force them to purchase national debt, it can only deprive them of their working capital. Working capital is the means by which all enterprises rely on for turnover activities and seek development. If it is once deprived and dried up, it will inevitably lead to poor turnover and stagnation, or even bankruptcy. At that time, the target of raising national debt will be lost, and only excessive issuance of banknotes can be used to fill war expenses. Therefore, this kind of means of draining the pond to catch fish is enough to promote the bankruptcy of Japan's financial economy.

The result of China's 22 months of resistance has left Japan's financial economy stretched. If we continue to resist resolutely, then in the near future, they will be exhausted, and will have no choice but to use the excessive issuance of banknotes as a means of raising war expenses. The result will not only completely bankrupt their financial economy, and make their military aggression unsustainable and lead to failure, but also cause all their enterprises to fall into a slump and lose their ability to invade. At that time, the foundation of peace in East Asia can be laid.

### Two Days and Nights of Fierce Fighting in Southern Shanxi: Chinese Troops Recapture Xia County, Japanese Troops Forcibly Crossing the Fen River Driven Back, Rumors of Commander Taniguchi Killed in Action

Xingji: The battle for Xia County in southern Shanxi between Chinese and Japanese forces has been intense, with fierce fighting lasting two days and nights. Chinese troops have successfully recaptured Xia County. Furthermore, on the western side of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, Chinese attacking units are engaged in fierce battles with Japanese troops on both banks of the Fen River. The Datong-Puzhou Railway has been severely damaged in many places by Chinese forces. In order to support the southern Datong-Puzhou Railway front, Japanese troops are operating westward from the Pinglu area. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)

Xingji: The situation on the southern Datong-Puzhou Railway front is tense. For the past three days, Chinese forces on both sides have been jointly launching attacks, with victories gradually unfolding since yesterday. The Japanese army can no longer secure the railway between Linfen and Lingshi. The section from Zhaocheng to Huoxian is completely under the control of the Chinese army. Japanese reinforcements are being dispatched south day and night, with the majority of the Hirayama Division, totaling over 10,000 men, arriving. On the previous two days, Japanese troops attempted to forcibly cross the Fen River to exert pressure westward, but were bravely repelled by Chinese forces. On the evening of the 20th, strong Chinese units successively crossed the Fen River, approaching the railway, intending to encircle and attack the Japanese troops. Coincidentally, a large number of Japanese troops arrived from the north, disembarking near Huoxian, attempting to cross the Fen River and attack the advancing Chinese troops. The Chinese army quickly ambushed its main force at Shitan Village and Ganhe Town, "20 li south of Huoxian." After a while, over a thousand Japanese troops indeed attempted to cross the river. The Chinese army, taking them by surprise when they were halfway across, launched a combined attack with rifles, machine guns, and artillery, resulting in fierce fighting for several hours. Over 300 Japanese troops were killed by the Chinese army. After suffering heavy casualties, the Japanese troops did not dare to continue crossing and fled eastward. In this battle, the Chinese side seized a large amount of military supplies. Over a hundred Japanese troops entrenched in Diantou, west of the Fen River, attempted to support the Linfen area. On the 19th, under the cover of heavy artillery, they advanced towards Zhangjiawo. After a brave resistance by the Chinese suicide squad, the Japanese troops were unable to sustain the attack and retreated back to Diantou. They then fiercely attacked Lujia Yuan, where the Chinese forces resolutely resisted, engaging in fierce fighting for several hours, ultimately failing to succeed. In the past two days, there have been frequent fierce battles in the Wangyu Luohan area, resulting in the deaths of over 300 Japanese troops. On the eastern side of the railway, in the Fushan area, the fighting between Chinese and Japanese forces remains intense. A Chinese suicide squad is advancing towards Linfen, having reached Dayang Town, east of Linfen. Over 2,000 Japanese troops have been transferred from the north to reinforce the Fushan area, indicating that the eastern front is also experiencing intense developments. There have been no major changes in the situation in the Heilongguan area. Japanese troops have repeatedly attempted to break through, but have so far failed. (Dispatch from the 22nd)

Yuanqu: On the 20th, Japanese troops advancing north and south of Yanzhang fought fiercely into the night, but were ultimately repelled by Chinese forces. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers died under the bayonets of Chinese troops. The intensity of the battle is imaginable. On the morning of the 21st, Japanese troops fiercely attacking Weiguo Village ("south of Yanzhang") were also repelled by Chinese forces. (Dispatch from the 22nd)

Yuan Dian: The 4,000 to 5,000 Japanese troops at Quan Dian (north of Qin County), a watershed on the Baiping Highway, and the surrounding areas of Gucheng Town and Shipan Town, after being attacked by Chinese forces for several days, retreated northward on the 17th towards Nanguan Town and areas north of it. Currently, a certain Chinese unit has crossed Zeyuan Town (north of Qin County) and is advancing northward. A certain brigade is divided, advancing eastward towards Zihongkou and Nanguan Town, pressing on a certain division and sweeping away the Japanese troops. (Dispatch from the 22nd)

Yuanqu: It is reported that after receiving reinforcements, the Japanese troops in Wenxi launched an attack towards Qian Yanzhang ("southeast of Wenxi") from the north and south on the morning of the 20th, with 200 to 300 infantry and cavalry, over ten artillery pieces, and eleven aircraft participating in the battle, in an attempt to reverse their declining situation. The Chinese army bravely countered, and were still engaged in hand-to-hand combat until night. (Dispatch from the 21st)

(Chongqing) On the Shanxi front, Chinese forces have completely surrounded the Japanese troops in Xia County, Wenxi, Yicheng, and Jiang County. The Japanese army, overwhelmed by the Chinese offensive, dispatched large formations of heavy bombers to indiscriminately bomb the advancing Chinese troops, but the Chinese continued to advance. Furthermore, Zhou Village, southeast of Yicheng in Shanxi, and Zhongwei, northeast of it, have been recaptured by Chinese forces. The Japanese troops in Yicheng are now completely cut off from the outside world, and the situation is extremely precarious. Moreover, when the Japanese troops in Linfen dispatched reinforcements to attack Fushan, Chinese mobile units suddenly attacked the Datong-Puzhou Railway and leveled the Linfen railway station. The Chinese army's offensive against Wenxi and Xia County this week has resulted in the deaths of over 3,000 Japanese soldiers. (Dispatch from the 21st, Associated Press)

### The Chinese National Diplomacy Association Sends a Telegram to Roosevelt

—Demanding the Prohibition of Arms Sales to Japan—

(Chongqing) The Chinese National Diplomacy Association believes that the current U.S. Neutrality Act is detrimental to China, which has been invaded, and that the "cash and carry" clause exclusively benefits Japan, the aggressor.

### Fake Currency Plummets

(Beijing) The sudden drop in the value of currency issued by the "United Reserve Bank" against the national currency has caused some concern here. The appreciation of the national currency against the "United Reserve" currency, which was 8%, has lasted for several weeks, but began to rise sharply from April 15th, reaching over 23% by April 19th. Since then, it has remained above 17%. It is generally believed that the devaluation of the "United Reserve" currency is due to the failure of the "United Reserve Bank's" plan to sell foreign exchange at 14 pence, resulting in everyone needing to purchase the necessary national currency from foreign banks to buy foreign exchange.

(New York) The well-informed "New York Times" reported today that a contract to order 100 or more aircraft to be shipped to China is currently under negotiation. In addition, negotiations are underway to order aircraft engines and other items worth $7 million to $15 million. This matter is currently being kept secret, but it is reported that the proposed contract includes 54 Sikorsky single-seat fighter planes with a speed of 300 miles per hour. However, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said that he was unaware of this matter. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 22nd)

### Tokyo Newspapers Advocate Anti-British Sentiment

(Tokyo) According to the Kokumin Shimbun, there is widespread anger in Japan among both the government and the public over reports that Britain not only intends to get closer to the Soviet Union, but also intends to expand the democratic front to the Far East. If the plans of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax develop actively, Japan will reconsider its attitude towards British interests in China. Britain is still providing open assistance to the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek, which continues to resist, and this has aroused anger throughout Japan. Britain's declaration that it wants to cooperate with the Soviet Union not only in Europe but also in the Far East can be seen as a sign that Britain is helping the Soviet Union to communize East Asia, which is simply a provocation to Japan. In view of Britain's attitude, it is feared that anti-British sentiment in Japan will become increasingly widespread in the future. What kind of diplomatic action the Japanese government should take to deal with Britain is a matter that the whole of Japan should pay close attention to. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 22nd)

### Japan Sinks Deeper and Deeper into the Mire. International Status Declines. If European and American Countries Cut Off Supplies to Japan, Japan Will Not Be Able to Sustain Itself for More Than Six Months

Manchester, England: Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, delivered a speech at the "Reform Club" here today, in which he discussed the Sino-Japanese war. He stated that if Japan cannot import goods from Western countries, it will be difficult to continue fighting for more than six months. In other words, if all countries can boycott Japanese goods on the one hand and prohibit the export of goods to Japan on the other hand, the Sino-Japanese war will definitely end soon. "The reason why Japan has been strutting on the Eastern stage is because Western countries have been hesitant or have not had the time to pay attention. This attitude of various countries is enough to fuel Japan's arrogance. Japan is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. It is only because of the turbulent and uneasy international situation that it has been able to take the opportunity to act recklessly. In the past, China had been seeking compromise in everything for six or seven years, but the reward we received was only a smile on the face of a tiger. This shows that the appeasement policy only serves to expand the tiger's appetite. But since China implemented resistance for twenty-one months, Japan's international status has almost fallen to that of a second-class country. As for China, the environment last year was the most dangerous, but since then, it has made great progress. Today, whether in military affairs, internal affairs, or diplomacy, it occupies a stronger position than before. Although China has lost some territory in the past, it has established a great self-sufficient base in the southwestern provinces." When Hankou fell, 80% of all movable objects there had been moved inland. This alone shows that the new China's purchasing power is by no means to be underestimated.

### Resisting Aggression Independently: China is Actually Fighting for the World

(London) The Manchester Guardian published an article today stating that careful and discerning observers believe that a new and powerful civilization is emerging on the mainland of East Asia, and its future will definitely have great influence throughout the world. There are two reasons for its emergence: one is the development of the Soviet Union in its Far Eastern territories such as Siberia, and the other is the Chinese government's decision to develop the western provinces. The special situation of Chinese migration to the West, in terms of scope and economic relations, can be compared to the westward movement in the United States in the 19th century and is even more important, because it has the nature of the European Renaissance movement. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi, in his speech yesterday, only talked about recent events, without the need to look far into the future, which was enough to make the audience understand the importance of China in the world. China is now at the forefront, making a great struggle against the atrocities that are also harming Britain. Before the British government thought of the appeasement policy, China had already tried the appeasement policy and suffered the harm of invasion. The decline of the world situation after the European War began in Manchuria. China is not a weakling, and it has not failed to fight alone until now. China's containment of Japan is no different from Britain's proposal to reduce armaments and President Roosevelt's call for peace, because China is fighting for itself, which is also fighting for us.

### The Soviet Union Firmly Believes that China Will Win the War of Resistance and Succeed in Nation-Building

(Moscow) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 7:00 PM broadcast to the nation on the 17th, and his remarks to Chinese and foreign reporters after the memorial week on the same day, have been reported in detail by Soviet newspapers. Soviet public opinion is very satisfied with Chairman Chiang's remarks, and believes that the Chinese leader's determination to resist until the end also represents the Chinese nation as a whole. Soviet people generally believe that Chairman Chiang's remarks represent the Chinese nation's rebuttal of the December 22nd statement by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe last year, and reiterate China's firm stance on resisting Japan. Japan's attempt to cover up its aggression with the term "establishment of a new order in East Asia" has been clearly exposed. Soviet officials are paying close attention to the situation in China and fully sympathize with China. They believe that China will definitely achieve final victory. The Chinese nation's war is not for the acquisition of land, but for its country's freedom and independence. This alone is enough to guarantee China's victory. (Dispatch from the 21st)

(Moscow) This newspaper commented on China's war of resistance, saying that China is fighting for independence. Japanese military officials originally hoped to launch a war to further divide China, but China has instead achieved unprecedented unity. Before the enemy's invasion, the whole country, regardless of party affiliation, united to form a national united front to defend independence and freedom. All the Chinese people firmly believe that they will win the victory, and the guarantee of this victory is the consolidation and strengthening of the national united front. After the Japanese occupied Guangzhou and Wuhan, they fully hoped that China's resistance would collapse and China would surrender. However, China not only did not surrender, but has strengthened its resistance in the past five months. With the help of guerrilla forces, the Chinese army has not only stopped the Japanese from continuing to advance after occupying Guangzhou, but also recovered some of the land initially lost. The Japanese army's major offensive to encircle and suppress the Eighth Route Army has also failed. The Eighth Route Army has also forced the Japanese to withdraw from many counties in western Shanxi, southern Shanxi, and eastern Shanxi.

At present, China still has countless difficulties, and the future struggle still requires major sacrifices, but since China has achieved unity, it will be able to overcome any difficulties. New cadres are being trained in the national liberation war, and new factories, including national defense industries, are being built, while old ones are being improved and expanded. New cultural centers are being formed, and old worldviews and customs are gradually disappearing, strengthening the national anti-Japanese united front, maintaining unity that has won the sympathy and support of the entire progressive mankind, and using its own vast resources, China will be able to achieve the final victory in the war of resistance.

### Plan to Eliminate Illiteracy Nationwide in Three Years

(Moscow) Soviet newspapers pay close attention to the arduous work of China's war of resistance and nation-building. All news about China's political and cultural development is eagerly published by various newspapers. The News recently published a report on China's efforts to eliminate illiteracy, which has achieved great success, stating that the Chinese Ministry of Education has drafted a plan to completely eliminate illiteracy among adults nationwide by 1941. Three years ago, the number of illiterate people in China reached 200 million. Today, the arduous task of eliminating illiteracy will definitely be realized, because the people of the whole country have given it enthusiastic support. (Dispatch from the 21st)

### U.S. Policy Toward Japan Becomes More Assertive. Protests and Fleet Movements are Both Noteworthy

(Washington) According to diplomatic sources, there has been a major change in U.S.-Japan relations. In this change, the United States' policy toward Japan will obviously become more assertive. So far, the visible signs of change are: (1) President Roosevelt did not include Japan when he submitted peace proposals to Hitler and Mussolini; (2) The Atlantic fleet was suddenly transferred back to the Pacific; (3) Secretary of State Hull declared that he had protested to Japan about the fact that Japanese people were restricting the activities of Americans in the Yangtze River and other occupied areas; (4) Undersecretary of State Welles summoned Japanese Ambassador Horita and personally raised this protest. All of these are signs that the U.S. policy toward Japan is becoming more active. However, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull are still not talking about the entire diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Japan, and are obviously deliberating carefully, because violations of American rights and interests by Japan in China continue to be discovered. The U.S. did not explain the purpose of the sudden transfer of the fleet to the Pacific, and did not provide any assurances to Japan, which is very noteworthy. Furthermore, according to naval officials, the U.S. fleet will continue to move westward to Hawaii. This move is likely to bring relations between the two countries into a tense area. Furthermore, the movement of the U.S. fleet coincides with the U.S. protest regarding the Yangtze River issue, so its significance is even more noteworthy. (Dispatch from the Associated Press on the 22nd)

(Washington) Twenty U.S. warships, which sailed out of the South Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, are expected to arrive in Guantanamo Bay today or tomorrow morning.

### Forming an Anti-Aggression League, Soviet Union Expresses Sincere Cooperation, Counterproposal Constructive, Anglo-Soviet Consultations Continue, Compromise Phase Expected, Anglo-Turkish Negotiations Reach Final Stage

(Paris) Negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union regarding the organization of an anti-aggression bloc are progressing smoothly. The Soviet government is reported to have submitted new proposals, which the British and French governments are currently studying. In addition, negotiations between Britain and Turkey regarding the organization of security in the eastern Mediterranean have entered the final stage and are about to be completed. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

(London) According to reports from the Paris correspondents of the "Daily Telegraph" and the "Daily Mail," the Soviet Union's proposals regarding the anti-aggression front all mention the Far East issue. The "Daily Telegraph" correspondent stated that it is widely believed that the Soviet proposal includes a system of mutual guarantees against aggression, not only in Europe but also in Asia. The "Daily Mail" correspondent stated that one of the features of the Soviet "counterproposal" is that if the Soviet Union is attacked from the rear by Japan while fulfilling its obligations in Eastern Europe, it will require assistance. The diplomatic correspondent of "The Times," without deviating from London's cautious approach, stated that the Soviet Union's contribution to the discussion is far-reaching and constructive in expanding the principle of common resistance to aggression in a more general sense. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Moscow. Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Mr. Maisky, arrived here this afternoon and reported to the government on the position the British government will take in future negotiations. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Seeds, also visited Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov today. According to sources here, Anglo-Soviet talks are currently proceeding well, but neither side has disclosed any information. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

(London) Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression bloc, diplomatic circles here recently stated that the Soviet government submitted a counterproposal on the 18th of this month, the content of which provides a useful basis for negotiation and demonstrates the country's sincere cooperation. Negotiations are continuing with the hope of creating a compromise between the original British proposal and the Soviet counterproposal, so that achievements can be made before the 28th of this month (the date of German leader Hitler's speech). The main points of the Soviet counterproposal are that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should form a mutual assistance agreement for a period of ten years. The British side believes that if this is realized, it would be tantamount to extending the guarantees that Britain and France have provided to Poland and Romania, applicable to aggression from any direction, and changing it to a guarantee applicable only to aggression from Germany and Hungary. The agreements to be established by Poland and Romania also have implications targeting Germany. All of these aspects are close to encircling Germany, which is inconsistent with Britain's original intention, and is not welcomed by Poland and Romania either. While each country intends to deal with Germany, they still want to leave some room for maneuver, so that they can still be close to Germany when threatened by the Soviet Union in the future. Moreover, if Britain forms a close alliance with the Soviet Union to target totalitarian states, then those countries that maintain friendly relations with Britain but are cautious and unwilling to take an anti-German stance will be wary. Although these countries also hope that Britain and the Soviet Union will cooperate to ensure the security of Eastern Europe, they are unwilling to pursue a common policy with the Soviet Union. In short, it is certain that the Soviet Union's proposal to adjust Eastern European security arrangements in advance is reasonable, but if the country can guarantee its neighboring countries and provide assistance when necessary, that is sufficient. Once the Anglo-Soviet agreement is established, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and the Soviet Union can exchange military opinions without the need for Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to conclude a mutual assistance agreement. In essence, Britain does not necessarily need to require Eastern European countries to change their policies and existing agreements to satisfy the Soviet Union's wishes. (Havas, 21st)

### US-Soviet Relations Aloof, Containing Subtle Effects

(Washington) Washington officials paid close attention last night to reports that the Soviet Union is about to form a military alliance with Britain and France. Although this military alliance is generally supported here, it is not expected to help restore the traditionally weak relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. This is because US authorities believe that any significant connection between the United States and the Soviet Union at present may further strengthen Japan's commitment to the Rome-Berlin Axis, resulting in a potentially more serious situation in the Pacific. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)

(New York) Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression bloc, Britain is actively conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union. The "New York Herald Tribune" recently commented that this negotiation is of great importance, as the anti-aggression front is not strong enough without the participation of the Soviet Union. "British Prime Minister Chamberlain has now accepted constraints on the Soviet Union that were unimaginable a few months ago. This man is daring to take risks, which is commendable. It should be known that if Britain and the Soviet Union can form a real alliance treaty, then the countries resisting the German-Italian axis will have an advantage in strength. Judging from the moderate tone of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's recent speech and the relative calm in Europe over the past two weeks, the tense situation in Europe has gradually eased. However, the active diplomatic activities in London should not be taken lightly." (Havas dispatch, 21st)

### Poland Values Soviet Union Joining

Warsaw. News received here this morning stated that the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to conclude an alliance with Britain and France. In addition to guaranteeing the vital interests of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is also willing to bear the responsibility of guaranteeing the security guarantees provided by Britain and France to other countries. Political figures here were quite attentive upon hearing this, as it indicates that the Soviet Union will also be involved with Poland, Romania, and Greece. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)

(Washington) Republican Congressman Fish, known for his opposition to President Roosevelt and the Soviet Union, is currently the president of the "Association to Prevent the United States from Participating in Foreign Wars." He delivered a radio address today, vehemently criticizing the president's current policy, stating that if President Roosevelt does not intervene in European events, believing that the United States can also participate in a future war, "I firmly believe that all democratic countries can protect all their interests through compromise and peaceful means." "President Roosevelt is to blame for the current fear of war and tension among the American people. Our foreign policy is based on threats and attacks suffered by other countries' policies. This is the reason for the emergence of the war psychology and xenophobia among the American people." Havas dispatch, 21st

### Italian-Yugoslav Talks Seek Political and Economic Cooperation, Yugoslav Foreign Minister to Visit Germany

(Rome) Yugoslav Foreign Minister Markovitch and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano are scheduled to hold a two-day meeting in Venice starting today. According to some opinions, Italy has recently made great efforts to improve its political strategy and economic position, and today's meeting is one such effort. In addition to wanting Yugoslavia to understand Italy's goodwill, Italy is also concerned that political divisions in Yugoslavia will give others the opportunity to intervene and act as protectors of Yugoslavia. Strategically, Italy is deeply concerned about the Adriatic Sea, so it closely studies the completely different demands of Belgrade (the capital of Serbia) and Zagreb (the capital of Croatia) regarding the entire Dalmatian coast. Economically, Yugoslavia is eager to obtain commercial loans from Italy. If a satisfactory agreement is reached, Italy may grant Yugoslavia the rights to the free zone of the Port of Trieste.

### European Small Countries Provide Answers to Germany, Hitler Intends to Paint a Picture of Peace, To Serve as a Basis for Refuting Roosevelt's Telegram

The Hague. The German government had posed three questions to the Netherlands: 1. Did the Dutch Parliament encourage President Roosevelt's telegram to some extent? 2. Was it aware of it beforehand? 3. Does it believe it is threatened by Germany? The Dutch government answered with negative responses. (Note: The German government had ordered its envoys stationed in various small European countries to inquire with the foreign ministries of those countries whether they recognized that their independence had been threatened by Germany, intending to refute President Roosevelt's telegram based on the negative responses of those countries.)

Capital of Lithuania. After receiving a German inquiry asking whether it feared German aggression, Lithuania replied that the recent treaty between Lithuania and Germany on the concession of Memel stated that Germany has an obligation to never resort to force against Lithuania or assist other countries in aggression. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

(London) The diplomatic negotiations regarding the organization of a "peace front" continue to be commented on by various newspapers, which all state that the progress is satisfactory. However, the question is how German leader Hitler will respond to US President Roosevelt. The Times reported, "Although it is still difficult to predict what kind of agreement will result from the diplomatic negotiations between Britain, France, and Russia, it is inevitable that the three countries will reach a practical understanding as a result." If war were to break out in the future, Soviet Russia would at least give Britain and France its active sympathy and goodwill, which the British government is deeply convinced of. The Daily Mail reported, "Leader Hitler will deliver a speech in the German parliament on the 28th of this month. It is expected that his wording will be designed to paint a picture of peace, explaining that Germany is committed to peace and has no intention of threatening any country. However, the major powers, after being suspicious and hostile towards Germany, are now planning to establish an alliance to encircle us, causing Germany to feel threatened. It should be known that if the small countries can refuse to join this anti-German front for even one day, Germany will be able to guarantee its safety for one day. Germany and its ally Italy are peace-loving, and there is no need for these countries to fear them. In addition, the German authorities are inquiring with the small countries whether they feel threatened by Germany. Leader Hitler will likely announce the answers of the small countries at that time to show that Germany has not threatened them. In fact, which of the small countries would want to offend Germany and admit that it feels threatened by it?" (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### Under the Threat of Violence, Only Able to Say Yes

(Paris) Authoritative sources here revealed today that German leader Hitler plans to announce to the outside world that the small countries surrounding Germany have guaranteed to Germany that they do not fear German aggression, in response to President Roosevelt's peace proposal. Germany is now trying to obtain statements from the small countries on its borders stating that they have never considered asking President Roosevelt to act on their behalf. Hitler has directly presented the following two questions to the small countries in Eastern Europe, the Balkans, and the Baltic states: 1. Are you afraid for your security and independence because of Germany? 2. Have you asked President Roosevelt to guarantee your security? It is reported that several answers to these questions have arrived in Berlin, and it is expected that at least some of the answers will confirm that some countries do not fear for their security and independence, nor have they asked President Roosevelt to protect them. French political circles believe that Hitler is preparing a significant demonstration that all of Germany's neighbors greatly trust Germany, so there is no need for President Roosevelt's proposal for Germany to provide anti-aggression guarantees to other European countries. It is widely believed that Hitler's strategic position is very secure, because countries that fear Germany would not dare to speak out. Moreover, if they dared to give any negative response to Hitler's questions, it would undoubtedly be inviting trouble. At the same time, Hitler may also use this strategy as a weapon to destroy the British and French guarantee nexus, as Germany will insist that if the small countries do not fear Germany, then they have no reason to participate in the "encirclement" policy and violate Germany.

### US Sees Through German Intentions, Decides to Adopt a Reserved Attitude

(Washington) The German government recently instructed its envoys stationed in various small European countries to ask the foreign ministries of the host countries whether they recognized that Germany was threatening their independence. US officials have commented on this move, stating that it is a strategy so that Leader Hitler can use the answers of these small countries as a basis for defense when he delivers a speech on the 28th of this month. In fact, the circumstances of these small countries are no different from being threatened at gunpoint by a thug. The reply they can offer to the question of whether they are safe is necessarily insincere. Therefore, the US government will necessarily treat it with reservation. Political figures say that regardless of the content of Leader Hitler's reply, the efforts of the democratic countries to establish an international security organization are supported by the vast majority of US public opinion, including isolationists. This can be seen from the speech given by isolationist leader and Republican Senator Borah to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said, "The American people are now united in opposing the totalitarian states. To put it bluntly, the United States can no longer strictly adhere to neutrality." (Havas dispatch, 21st)

### Mussolini Sends Telegram to Hitler to Congratulate Him, Maintaining Friendship Forever, Never Forget

Berlin. Mussolini's telegram to Hitler said that the German-Italian public would never break the axis. The Italian people participated with unity of enthusiasm in defending the firm and real friendship of our two countries and two revolutionary concepts. This friendship would endure many hardships without falling, and our cause would eventually enlighten those who had gone astray. Fascism and National Socialism are both great avenues to achieving justice and peace. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### France Vigorously Implements Tax Increases and Government Cuts to Meet Defense Needs, Finance Minister Urges the People to Sacrifice for the Country, Responsibility to Resist Aggression is Extremely Important

(Paris) The cabinet held a state council meeting this afternoon, which immediately passed several legislative decrees to meet various defense needs. The most important of these include: (1) Increasing funding for the four departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Colonies; (2) Paying in advance for the value of various defense-related items ordered by the government from factories; (3) Planning for wartime food supply; (4) Strictly monitoring private income to avoid income tax evasion; (5) Levying a tax on the profits of the arms industry to limit the profits of arms factories to no more than 10% of the turnover; (6) Exempting the principal and interest of national defense bonds from income tax altogether; (7) Levying a transaction tax of 1% on the sale of various items, except for necessities such as milk, bread, newspapers, and existing goods; (8) Reducing business license taxes by 10% in 1940 to reduce the burden on merchants; (9) Suspending funding for various public works projects that are not urgently needed; (10) Reducing the number of civil servants, including railway employees, to save money; (11) Exempting inherited real estate valued at less than 300,000 francs from inheritance tax. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

(Paris) Finance Minister Reynaud delivered a radio address today, explicitly asking the people of the country to make sacrifices for the national interest. His remarks stated, "For the sake of the future of the world, France must maintain its strength, especially today. Assuming that France no longer exists, it is unknown how Britain and even the United States would protect themselves. We have understood how important France's position is. If we abandon ourselves in Europe today, the integrity of its imperial territory will be impossible to maintain. To this day, there is only one party in our country called French national strength. The government's responsibility is to strengthen national strength. In recent months, the government has actively promoted the revival policy, with remarkable results, and has been able to cope with new obligations." In the past fourteen months, a certain country in Europe has quietly become a historical term. The reason for this is that our opponent has repeatedly won major victories due to the development of their wartime industrial production." At a time when countries are competing to expand their armaments, Britain and France must find ways to respond. "The government has now decided to raise 15,000,000,000 francs for military spending, as the arms race is causing major sacrifices for all countries, whether totalitarian or democratic. Our neighboring country has a population of 80 million, and its factories work 60 hours a week. In our country, there are only 40 million people, so we must catch up quickly and increase the normal weekly working hours of factories from 40 hours to 45 hours. In short, what we now hope from the people of the country is to work hard, fulfill their responsibilities, and think of their children, so that they can maintain peace." (Havas, 21st)

### The Situation in Guangdong Takes a Sharp Turn for the Worse: Chinese Troops Press on Guangzhou, Northern Route Chinese Army 10+ Li Away, Japanese Army Prepares to Retreat and Moves Supplies First

Hong Kong Dispatch: Since its fall, Guangzhou has suffered for six months. The city's essence is exhausted, and citizens have migrated, destitute and displaced, dying in ditches. Such a catastrophe is unprecedented. Those remaining in the urban area are merely the old, the sick, the destitute, and local ruffians, numbering no more than tens of thousands. Besides these are Japanese military police, navy, garrison troops, puppet self-defense forces, and Japanese soldiers who came to Guangzhou under the pretext of defending the perimeter. Shops are entirely closed. Those that exist are only inferior goods shops run by Japanese merchants. Regarding transportation, all waterways and roads connecting the provincial capital with various towns are cut off. City electricity and water are only for the Japanese military. The once-thriving streets are desolate and barren. Patriotic and homeland-loving Guangdong people are deeply pained by this, vowing to splatter Yi barbarians with blood and taking the recovery of their homeland as their duty. They are merely hampered by the superior military equipment of the Japanese, who occupy the east, west, and north of the Pearl River, and possess strong fortifications. The Guangdong military authorities, considering the overall picture for the counter-offensive, have to act with thorough deliberation and prudence to ensure complete success. After five or six months of preparation, adjusting various troop units, training guerrillas, stockpiling military supplies, and coordinating with the air force, all of which took time, preparations were finally completed recently, and the counter-offensive began.

Recovering Xin Jie and Heading Straight for Gaotang

At the beginning of this month, Zhang Fakui, acting commander of the Fourth War Area, busied himself in the northeast of the Pearl River, arranging everything. Yu Hanmou, commander-in-chief of the Twelfth Army Group, who had previously been responsible for guarding the land, issued a public letter to the people of Guangdong on the 15th regarding leading the army to counter-attack, declaring that he would devote his remaining life to atoning for his crimes and saving his homeland. Thus, on the ninth of this month, all Guangdong soldiers launched simultaneous attacks from the east, west, and north. The northern route army broke through the Japanese army in Huaxian on the ninth, annihilating the Watanabe and Fujita main forces. The Chinese army's morale was high, and they took advantage of the victory to recover Xin Jie. Afterwards, the Japanese army launched a full-force counter-attack, and the Chinese army retreated slightly. On the 15th, the Chinese army launched another counter-attack and once again defeated the Japanese army in Xin Jie. On the 16th, they took Jiangcun and Gaotang in one go, only about sixteen Li away from Guangzhou. Since the 16th, they have been rushing to build defensive works above Shijing to protect the Japanese army entrenched in the suburbs. On the 17th, the Chinese army moved south along the Yuehan Railway with overwhelming momentum. The Japanese armies on the Guangsan Road and the West River were in danger of having their retreat cut off. Guanyao, which belongs to Nanhai County, is located at the intersection of the northwest Pearl Rivers. It was attacked by the Chinese army guerrillas on the 8th. The four hundred Japanese soldiers there retreated. The pseudo-organization figures in the market town have been shot by the Chinese army. Afterwards, the Japanese army fought desperately, using heavy artillery and the air force to bombard the town. The guerrillas temporarily moved to a new position, but the entire town of Guanyao has been controlled by the guerrillas. As for the Chinese army advancing south along the Yuehan Railway, they have now divided their forces into one route, bypassing Xin Jie to Longkou in Huaxian, to prevent the Japanese army in Huaxian from disturbing the rear of Xin Jie. If the Japanese army in Longkou is cleared, the Chinese army can then push from Longkou into the Huaxian Fan 　Highway, to strike the back of the Japanese army in the suburbs of Guangzhou. As for the Chinese army on the northeast route, one route has recovered Zengcheng, and the other is fiercely attacking Taipingchang from Conghua, cutting off the connection between the Japanese army there and the south of Zengcheng and the west of Huaxian. On the 14th, the Japanese army in Taipingchang suffered a blow, with more than 300 casualties. There are no traces of the Japanese army near the Mast Market of Shegang now.

Recover Zengcheng

Japanese Retreat to Shitan

The Wu Qiwai unit of the East Route Army fought a bloody battle with the Japanese army near Zengcheng since the 12th, holding for two days and nights. On the morning of the 14th, the Japanese army in Zengcheng could not hold on and retreated south one after another. Wu's unit officially recovered Zengcheng on the 14th. On the same day, the Japanese army in Guangzhou received a report and immediately dispatched a team to aid, but they were ambushed by the guerrillas near Mount Luofu midway, and they could not move forward. The Japanese reinforcements then retreated to the mountainous area around Luogangdong, north of Shitan, to resist stubbornly. The Chinese army also attacked the remnants of the Japanese army west of Zengcheng from Fuhuo Market, successively capturing Shiqiao and Zhucun. The road from Longyandong in Guangzhou to Zengcheng has also been controlled by the Chinese army. The Japanese army now faces the complete collapse of the outer defense line of Guangzhou. The Chinese army on the northeast route is approaching the suburbs of Guangzhou, and the guerrillas in the suburbs have risen again. The Japanese army's military transport cannot be smooth. The isolated city of Guangzhou may be difficult to defend for long. They have been building defensive works on the highlands in the northeastern suburbs for days to protect the Japanese army's retreat in an emergency.

Japanese Garrison Troops

Withdraw to Henan

At present, the Japanese army in Guangzhou has no way out. The Chinese army on the east route is approaching Shilong, Shitan, Dongguan, and Taiping, which may fall at any moment. The Chinese armies on the northwest route will also reach the southern end of the Yuehan and Guangsan Roads. If the Japanese army withdraws from Guangzhou, they can only retreat to Huangpu first, and then scurry away on warships. It is reported that since the 14th, most of the Japanese garrison troops in Guangzhou have withdrawn to various districts of Panyu in Henan. The electric oil, shells, and military supplies stored in the Japanese warehouse at Dajingkou in Henan have also been transported by vehicles to Huangpu, unloaded onto transport ships, and prepared for export. The First Office of the Japanese Southern China Dispatch Army in the Zhongda Hospital on Baizi Road in Dongmen has also moved to the eastern suburbs. The Japanese military police in Guangzhou have now withdrawn part of their forces, leaving only two-thirds. (April 17)

### Japanese Warships Seize British Ships to Taiwan: British Ships Protested but Were Ineffective, Hong Kong Foreign Rice Dared Not to Be Transported to Shantou Again

Shantou Dispatch: The British merchant ship "Sigs" of the Hong Kong Jardine Matheson Company was intercepted on the sea near Dongshan Quan Bay in southern Fujian. At 2 PM on the 8th, when dozens of salt boats were loading salt onto the ship, two Japanese patrol ships suddenly sailed from Xiamen, firing cannons to threaten and seize the Sigs and salt boats, sailing towards Taiwan. The British warship "Elo" in Shantou received a telegram asking for help and immediately sailed to Dongshan to negotiate with the commander of the Japanese patrol ship. The Japanese Navy argued forcefully, saying, "We are ordered to step up the blockade of the South China coast to cut off all military supplies and materials from entering to aid the Chiang government and continue the anti-Japanese resistance." They also said, "Dongshan Island is not a commercial port, and foreign ships unloading goods there violate international law, so we will detain them for inspection." The British warship argued on the grounds that China and Japan have not formally declared war, and British ships have the freedom to travel along the Chinese coast according to commercial treaties. Moreover, the Sigs was carrying salt, which is not comparable to military supplies. However, the above negotiations were still ineffective. The Sigs and salt boats were eventually seized to Taiwan. There was one British owner and eighteen Chinese workers on board. The Japanese warships also threatened to continue to inspect foreign ships entering and leaving the port of Shantou, and must cut off all imports. The British warship Elo returned to Shantou on the 9th and reported to the British consul. The case was handed over to the government for negotiation. The Shantou rice merchants, hearing this bad news, urgently telegraphed the Hong Kong joint venture to stop shipping goods to Shantou. The tax-free foreign rice to relieve refugees also did not dare to be shipped in. Furthermore, five Japanese warships are now gathered at Mayu Port in Shantou, with the purpose of searching foreign ships. Their sailors also have intentions of landing on the Fujian border. The sailors of the British and American warships in Shantou notified the municipal government and landed on the 13th to practice protecting overseas Chinese merchants in Qi Lu. The situation is very serious.

### Japanese Troops in Jiangyin: Searching Townships, Harassing for Four Days Without Gaining Anything

Jiangyin Dispatch: Since the 28th of last month, when the group of uglies was celebrating the anniversary of the establishment of the pseudo-"Renovated Government" in Cheng Yu, several young and strong men suddenly mixed into the scene and killed the pseudo-detective Yang Hanqing. They also killed one Japanese soldier and two pseudo-police officers at the East Gate. The Japanese and pseudo-authorities were greatly terrified and closed the city gates for four days. The houses near the city were ordered to be demolished. Entry and exit to the city gates were not allowed without a citizen's card. Also, because the guerrillas in the countryside have been very strong recently, the Japanese and pseudo-authorities in the city were alarmed several times a night. Qito, the Japanese police chief, and Bian Shang, the pseudo-police chief, led more than two hundred Japanese soldiers, taking motorboats to search for guerrillas in the southeastern towns. They first went to Yunting Changshou, then to Beibei, Changjing, Hudaibridge, Lujiaqiao, Maoshuqiao, Zhutang, Gushan, Nanxinqiao, and Yangku. Beforehand, young women and strong men, hearing the news, had already fled. The guerrillas used the method of avoiding the real and attacking the empty, only having slight contact in Huashu, using Shanshan as a barrier. The Japanese army was in the countryside for a total of four days, gaining nothing. They returned to the city along Qingdao. In the towns they arrived at, many chickens and pigs were searched and taken away, and the residents were greatly frightened.

### Chinese Delegation Returning from the World Youth Congress: Yang Huimin, the Girl Scout Who Presented the Flag to the Isolated Army, Talks About Her Experiences and Publicity Liaison

(Kunming Air Dispatch) The Chinese delegation that attended the World Youth Congress in England has returned home and arrived in Yunnan at the beginning of this month. Yang Huimin, the brave girl scout who presented the flag to the isolated army of the Four Banks in Shanghai, also attended the conference representing the Chinese Girl Scouts. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency in Kunming visited her upon her arrival in Yunnan. Ms. Yang has short hair, wears a girl scout uniform, is physically strong, speaks elegantly, has a graceful attitude, and is full of the innocent, lively, and enthusiastic spirit of a girl scout. When asked about her experiences abroad, she talked about the following.

President's Wife Attended the Meeting Twice

There were a total of four female members of the Chinese delegation attending the conference, but there were more than two hundred female representatives at the conference. President Roosevelt's wife also attended the meeting twice. The first time was to attend a lecture, and the second time was to visit and listen. In addition to attending meetings, I also did publicity and liaison work for scouts and women in various places. In France and the Netherlands, I held enthusiastic discussion meetings with the scouts of those countries. The scouts of those countries expressed their utmost admiration for China's resistance against Japan. Moreover, in various countries in Europe and America, the story of my presenting the flag to the isolated army of the Four Banks in Shanghai had been made into cigarette photographs, so my speeches were quite popular everywhere.

Activities of Overseas Chinese Scouts

In order to enable people from various countries to understand the spirit of service of Chinese scouts in the War of Resistance and the efforts of women in rescue and rear area work, I was invited to give speeches to scouts in major cities in the United States after the conference. I also explained the situation of China's resistance against Japan. Overseas Chinese scouts can only do extracurricular activities, because all activities are more restricted under the control of foreign governments. Therefore, in addition to publicity and fundraising, they also raised a large number of medicines to bring back to China to relieve refugees and children. As for foreign scouts, they are very sympathetic to China's resistance against Japan. They do not want to hear news of China losing ground and bloodshed, but want to hear about China's construction and the spirit of new Chinese youth.

Excellent Burmese Scout Organization

On the way back to China, I continued to promote scouting and made practical contacts in various places. The Burmese Chinese scouts have the best organization. I will help them organize the Anti-Enemy Association and the Wartime Service Corps. They are very eager to return to China to serve. According to this, five overseas Chinese girl scouts have returned to China with the examination group to study and prepare to participate in the anti-Japanese war. This is also a small achievement of this overseas publicity. As for future work, I plan to report the results of the publicity to Chiang Kai-shek's wife and the Boy Scouts of China after returning to Chongqing before deciding on the joint strike method.

Kunming Scout Community Welcomes Enthusiastically

At two o'clock in the afternoon, the Yunnan Boy Scouts Council convened boy scouts from all schools in the city to meet at the Provincial Party Headquarters to welcome Ms. Yang Huimin. Ni Jiaqi, a wartime service inspector from the Boy Scouts of China, also welcomed her. Council members Chen Xiushan, Fang Shaokun, Guo Shaoming, and others, and scout instructors from various schools, totaling about a thousand people, attended the meeting. After the meeting, Chen Xiushan, a member of the council, gave a welcoming speech on the spot, followed by speeches by Inspector Ni Jiaxi and Ms. Liu Fuquan, a guest of Ms. Yang Huimin. It was not until four-thirty that they took a photo and dispersed. Immediately afterwards, a banquet was held at the Provincial Government Club to entertain Inspector Ni and Ms. Yang Huimin.

### Hong Kong International Cup Football - Chinese Team Champions - Decisive Victory of Nine to Two over Portuguese Team - Four Out of Six Major Trophies Won

(Hong Kong Correspondence) This year's Hong Kong football scene can be said to be dominated by the Chinese community. In the major trophy competitions, the Governor's Cup, the Lihua Cup, and the Special Silver Plate have all been won by the Chinese Athletic Association and South China Athletic Association. On the 16th, the Chinese team faced Portugal in the International Cup final at the So Kon Po field. As a result of the disparity in strength, the Chinese team decisively defeated the Portuguese team by a score of nine to two, retaining the International Cup. From now on, out of the six major trophies, the Chinese community has already won four. The remaining two are only the First Division Championship and the Asahi Cup. However, the Chinese South China Athletic Association is confident in winning these two as well, so there is a great possibility that all six championships will belong to the Chinese community. Could this year be the year of the Chinese? Yesterday's International Cup match was a one-sided affair. Hou Chengtou scored the first goal, followed by Deng Guangsen. Aluwick scored one for Portugal, making it two to one. Hou Chengtou and the "King of Football" then scored three consecutive goals, ending the first half at five to one. After switching sides, Li Huitang quickly shot and scored. Li Zhaorong and Feng Jingxiang added three more goals, ending the game with a score of nine to two after Dagaoshan Nunu managed to score one for Portugal.

### China Collects Gold, to Reach 900,000 Ounces - Every 300,000 Ounces of Gold Sufficient to Issue Over 144 Million in Paper Currency - Economic Victory Over Japan Evidenced

According to a report from Chongqing by the Continental Daily News, since the start of the war, China has been collecting gold to ensure economic victory over Japan. The National Government is using two methods to increase gold reserves: purchasing gold and mining gold. The former is handled by the Ministry of Finance, and the latter is handled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Ministry of Finance is using all possible means to purchase gold coins, gold-plated items, and gold bars. Under the guidance of the Ministry of Finance, four government banks have established gold and silver purchasing offices in Chongqing. Branches of the four banks are also engaged in purchasing and collecting local

people's gold and silver

By January, the Chongqing branch of the Central Bank had collected 13,000 ounces. If this record is maintained, it is expected that 80,000 ounces can be collected by June. Adding the amount collected by the other three banks, this figure should reach 200,000 ounces. The authorities have also asked various commercial banks to purchase gold. For example, the Meifeng Bank (transliteration) and the Chuan Kang Bank once collected around 20,000 ounces of gold. If this source is included in the calculation, the total amount purchased is expected to reach 300,000 ounces. The above figures are only for Chongqing. However, if we take into account the amount collected by the branches in various provinces, the monthly

gold collection

may reach 100,000 ounces. Adding this figure to the 300,000 ounces expected to be collected in Chongqing, the total amount will reach 900,000 ounces by the end of June. On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been actively engaged in gold mining since last year. Under the management of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Gold Mining Bureau and the gold-producing provinces cooperate on management and technical matters. The National Resources Commission, also managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, is dedicated to conducting trial excavations in gold-producing areas. Regarding the amount of gold produced in China's western

vast areas

there are no accurate figures, but according to a member of the National Resources Commission, it is estimated that 1,000 ounces of gold can be mined each month, with the potential to mine 15,000 ounces annually. All of this is exciting news, as 300,000 ounces of gold can support the issuance of 144 million yuan in paper currency.

### Japanese Warships Shell Wenzhou Estuary - Wenzhou City Tranquil - Reports of Wenzhou Being Bombed Confirmed Inaccurate - Baoli Ship Blocked to Measure Sea - Japanese Reconnaissance Ships Constantly Patrol

On the 17th of this month, at 11:50 AM, a Japanese seaplane invaded Wenzhou, flying low and circling for a long time for reconnaissance purposes. At 12:20 PM, it intruded into the airspace of Ruian and Pingyang for reconnaissance. On the 27th, at 8:00 AM, a small Japanese warship was discovered passing Damenshan from east to west, off the Hengshan waters outside the Zhenhai estuary in Ningbo. On the 20th, at around 11:00 AM, a Japanese warship fired three shots at Hutoudu, and also seized two fishing boats before sailing away. Currently, Japanese warships patrol the waters off the coast of eastern Zhejiang.

Baoli Ship Blocked Outside Wenzhou Estuary The Baoli ship, owned by the Italian-owned Yihua Company, departed from Shanghai for Wenzhou at 4:00 PM on the 20th of this month. Yesterday morning, it reported to the company in Shanghai that when the ship reached the Wuli waters off Huanghua, outside the Wenzhou estuary, it was forced to stop by a Japanese warship anchored there. Soldiers boarded the ship for inspection, and the captain was temporarily notified and advised to stop sailing into Wenzhou, stating that there were military operations in the area and that navigation was quite dangerous. The ship is temporarily anchored in the Wuli waters, and it is uncertain whether it will sail to Wenzhou or return.

Moufou Telegraphs Japanese Warship Opens Fire A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the foreign ship docked in Wenzhou for unloading was the Moufou ship, owned by the German-owned Lihe Company. After the report of the Baoli being blocked reached Shanghai, the Lihe Company telegraphed the Moufou to inquire. Because the Moufou was communicating with Ningbo, it was temporarily unable to connect. It was not until 4:00 PM yesterday that the Moufou telegraphed that the Japanese warship opened fire on the Oujiang estuary yesterday before stopping. It is now determined that the Moufou will sail back to Shanghai this afternoon.

Wenzhou City Peaceful as Usual After receiving the news of the Baoli being blocked yesterday morning, various companies telegraphed Wenzhou to inquire about the truth. They have already received replies from various companies in Wenzhou, confirming that although the Oujiang estuary of Wenzhou was shelled by Japanese warships yesterday morning, the city of Wenzhou is peaceful as usual. Therefore, various ships will sail as scheduled today.

Eastern Zhejiang Coast Heavily Guarded Various places along the coast of eastern Zhejiang have long been garrisoned with heavy troops, heavily guarded. Haimen and other places are completely sealed off, and navigation is prohibited in Ningbo. The Ende ship of the Italian-owned Zhongyi Company, which was previously specially allowed to sail to Ningbo, was scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ningbo today. Now, except for Wenzhou, all navigation is prohibited. The Baoli telegraphed last night that it was still anchored in the Wuli waters because the Japanese warship outside the Oujiang estuary had not left. As for the rumors in Shanghai yesterday that Japanese planes bombed Wenzhou, it has been confirmed to be inaccurate. However, the shelling of the Oujiang estuary is indeed a fact.

### Various Organizations Telegraph Chiang Kai-shek to Severely Punish Wang Jingwei's Followers

Various mass organizations in the city telegraphed President Chiang Kai-shek yesterday, requesting that Wang Jingwei's followers, such as Zhou Fohai, be expelled from the party and dismissed from their positions for investigation. The original telegram stated: "To President Chiang of the Central Party Headquarters in Chongqing: Since Wang Zhaoming openly defected to the enemy, his followers, Zhou Fohai, Lin Baisheng, Chu Minyi, and others, have been actively promoting the enemy's cause. Newspaper reports provide solid evidence. Therefore, we specially telegraph this matter, respectfully requesting Your Excellency to convene an executive supervisory meeting to promptly expel Zhou Fohai and others from the party and dismiss them from their positions for investigation, in order to uphold discipline. The Party and the country will be fortunate. Submitted by various organizations in Shanghai."

### Women's National Spiritual Mobilization Conference - Telegrams Respect to Chiang and His Wife - Women in Occupied Areas Suffer the Most Humiliation - Resolutely Determine to Smash the Enemy's Treacherous Schemes

The Women's National Spiritual Mobilization Association has been formally established recently, and a solemn oath-taking ceremony was held. It is now actively promoting the organization of branches, and it is expected that a large number of branches can be established in the near future. All ordinary housewives, who rarely participate in activities at ordinary times, are now joining branches to jointly implement the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and the National Public Purpose. Today is Women's Propaganda Day, and the Association issued a special declaration, advising all women in the city to work together. The declaration is as follows:

### Declaration

Shanghai has two million women. To be honest, perhaps many of them have not done their best for this sacred war of resistance in our country. However, everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world. We are all the same people, all the same invaded Chinese people. "If the skin is gone, what will the fur cling to?" How can we not be responsible? Don't say that if the country is destroyed, women can survive alone. Please see the people in the occupied areas, who are the most ravaged, is it not our women? "National Spiritual Mobilization," we should know the intention and hard work of Chairman Chiang in putting it forward. The War of Resistance has entered the second stage, politics is more important than military affairs,

civilian strength is more important than military force.

Mobilizing the people so that every person understands "the country above all else, the nation above all else" and resolutely implements "concentration of will, concentration of strength." This is not just talk on paper, but a head-on blow to smash the enemy's treacherous schemes. You must know that the War of Resistance is the only way for the Chinese people to survive, and the War of Resistance is also the most arduous task for the Chinese people. If we only let the soldiers fight to the death on the battlefield and enjoy the benefits ourselves, will there be certainty of victory? If we have no faith in the War of Resistance, against the enemy and Chinese traitors

provocative and divisive tricks,

will there be hope of victory? If we women live in a drunken dream, shirking responsibility, only letting men fight the war and save the country, spiritual mobilization, will victory come to us? So we have to mobilize, organize, be kind, unite, be corrupt, transform, be brave, be generous, be aware, come forward, and be even more determined. Everyone is responsible for saving the country, and everyone comes to work in the war of resistance. This is what is called "spiritual mobilization." We must

understand national affairs and military affairs,

we must understand the world situation, we must transform our lives, we must revitalize our spirits, we must strengthen our will, use money for the war of resistance, and use strength for the war of resistance. When necessary, even life must be sacrificed for the war of resistance. The power of women is great, is not the responsibility of mothers great? We have organized the "Shanghai Women's National Spiritual Mobilization Association" on April 16, and the number of people is not large and the energy is limited, but we sincerely hope

to promote all the women in the city

to unanimously participate in the organization, unanimously implement the "National Public Purpose," and unanimously understand the leadership of the leader. Let every woman living in Shanghai, as well as women fleeing to Shanghai, exert a little power in the war of resistance. Let us sincerely hold hands.

### Circular Telegrams

(1) Respectfully to Chongqing: Since the enemy invaded and the War of Resistance began, thanks to the leadership of our Chairman Chiang, the country is unified, and the soldiers are loyal. The enemy's delusions have been shattered without a trace. Recently, the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline has been promulgated and implemented throughout the country, in order to complete the War of Resistance and national construction as soon as possible. The women of Shanghai are patriotic and dare not lag behind. In addition to complying with the order to organize, we respectfully send our regards. Shanghai Women's National Spiritual Mobilization Association bows. (2) Respectfully to Madam Chiang: Since the War of Resistance began, the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chairman, have been united in resisting foreign aggression. The momentum has shocked the world, and the enemy's delusions have been shattered without a trace. Recently, the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline has been promulgated, laying the foundation for the great cause of national construction. Madam's assistance is admired by the world, and she has also presided over the leadership and preservation of children, the foundation of the nation, in many ways. Women across the country look up to her with admiration. Our Shanghai women are following in Madam's footsteps and have established the Women's National Spiritual Mobilization Association. We hereby represent all the women in the city to pay our respects to Madam. We humbly ask her to take care of herself for the sake of the country. Shanghai Women's National Spiritual Mobilization Association bows.

### French Concession Flag Hanging Case - City Hopes for Immediate Resolution - Arrested Citizens Released - National Flags Still Not Returned

The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association in the French Concession is negotiating the flag-hanging case, and has put forward three items to the French police authorities: (1) Release the arrested citizens, (2) Return the seized national flags, (3) Do not interfere with flag-hanging in the future. Currently, except for the first item, the arrested citizens have been released by the police station, and the third item has also been resolved through the telegraphic requests of various public organizations to the Foreign Office for negotiations. As for the second item, the return of the national flags, since the Ratepayers Association sent a letter to the French Consul General the day before yesterday, requesting that the Louza Police Station return them as soon as possible, various merchants have been inquiring with the Association yesterday. However, as of 7:00 PM yesterday, the Association has not yet received the seized national flags from the French police station. Today is the weekly holiday, and we should wait until Monday. As May is approaching in an instant, and it is customary to hang flags on commemorative days, merchants and citizens in the French Concession are hoping that this case will be resolved reasonably as soon as possible, so as to avoid the continuation of unfortunate events. It is rumored that the representatives of the Ratepayers Association continued to negotiate with the French authorities the day before yesterday and yesterday, but this is not true.

### Ratepayers Association Yesterday Sent a Letter to the Public Works Department - Consider Increasing Donations to Protect Legal Interests - If Tax Increase is Inevitable, it Should be Reduced in the Future - Implement the Spirit of the Rule of Law to Protect Legitimate Rights and Interests

The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association in the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, requesting consideration of increasing donations to protect legal interests. (1) Respectfully, on April 17 this year, when the Association held its first representative meeting of the year, it discussed the decision of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to increase the municipal general donation by 2% from October 1, 1939. The Association should write to the Department again to reconsider the case. It was resolved to write to the Public Works Department, requesting reconsideration of the decision to increase donations. If there are indeed financial difficulties and it is inevitable to implement it, it should be reduced when the market conditions are better and the exchange rate is restored in the future, so as to alleviate the people's difficulties. Correspondingly, the record should be reported. I hope you will investigate and handle it. (2) Respectfully, on April 17 this year, when the Association held its first representative meeting of the year, it discussed that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession has been working hard to protect the legal interests of citizens and expand Chinese education over the past year. The Association should write to the Department to express its gratitude and ask it to adhere to its original intention, implement the spirit of the rule of law, and protect legal rights and interests. The case was passed accordingly, and the record should be reported for your investigation and handling.

### Frozen Fish Industry Sends Letter to Fresh Pork Industry - Sympathy and Comfort - Similar Circumstances - Mutual Determination to Sacrifice

The Shanghai Frozen Fish Industry Association sent a letter to the Fresh Pork Industry Association yesterday, saying, "In recent days, we have seen reports that the Japanese and puppet forces are coveting the fresh pork and livestock business, and are using shameless Chinese traitors to monopolize it. Your Association's expressed position is righteous and eloquent, and is admired by the patriotic people of the city. The environment in which our Association is located is the same as that of your Association, and it has long been devastated. However, a few scum in the industry are willing to be lackeys of the tiger. Their intentions are nothing more than to fill their own pockets. However, they do not know that there is a precedent for birds being hunted and bows being hidden, and dogs being slaughtered when their usefulness is over. Our Association expresses its deep sympathy for your Association's heroic actions and sends this letter of condolence. I hope you will investigate and handle it." The Fresh Pork Industry Association replied with a letter of thanks, saying, "We received your letter of the 21st of this month, and we are fully aware of it. We are honored to receive your condolences and encouragement, and we are extremely grateful. Our Association is currently fighting against evil forces. Although the success or failure is difficult to predict, non-submission is the only principle of our Association. Even in the worst case, we can only sacrifice for justice and wait for the future resumption of business. We are grateful for your concern, and we hereby report it to you and express our gratitude."

Also, the "Shanghai Livestock and Fresh Pork Market" office established by the Japanese "puppet" side is located in the Huning Meat Company on Yuezhou Road, Hongkou. It has established a storage yard and a pig-weighing market, with Sun Hongxiang as the chairman, Fan Deyu and others as directors, Huang Qisheng as the manager, and Yang Zhuqing as the salesman. It is also reported that various pig firms such as Changshun Wanshen have been seduced. It is planned to collect one yuan from each pig brokerage firm as commission, as well as various miscellaneous fees and two yuan for transportation, and two yuan for control fees. Fresh pork must be packaged by Japanese merchant ships and exclusively sold by the market. More than a dozen inspection teams will be dispatched, each team with one Chinese and two Japanese lackeys, to block pig vendors from entering the market at the station and port.

### Insufficient Manpower - Japanese Will Force Chinese to Fight - People From Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fleeing to Shanghai - Situation in Beijing and Hangzhou Extremely Tense

According to the North-China Daily News, Chinese people along the railway line in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are fleeing to Shanghai in large numbers because of rumors that the Japanese army is drafting young men to fight for them. This indicates that the already overcrowded situation in Shanghai today may worsen. It is heard that the Japanese army, because all the troops are fighting and cannot solve the problem of troop allocation, has begun to force the Chinese to form an army and fight for the Japanese army. According to refugees who recently arrived in Shanghai, the situation in Beijing and Hangzhou is indeed quite tense.

They dispatched agents to join the various guerrilla units, taking advantage of opportunities to spread rumors and fabricate information, causing the leaders of the various units to become suspicious of each other and eventually engage in fratricidal strife, in order to achieve their poisonous plan of using Chinese to control Chinese.

The Truth About the Misunderstanding. The recent misunderstanding between Yu Taosheng, Ding Xishan, and Li Zhiming was the result of this conspiracy. The three detachments of Yu, Ding, and Li were all part of the Loyal National Salvation Army, directly under the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee of the Military Affairs Commission. Yu's unit was stationed in Nanhui, Ding's unit in Songjiang, and Li's unit in Fengxian. In the middle of this month, Ma Bosheng, a councilor from the commissioner's office, convened a meeting in Datuan with Ding Xishan and his subordinate Fan Gencai. At this time, the Japanese army had obtained intelligence and dispatched plainclothes Japanese soldiers from Minhang to Xuliqiao and Jinhuiqiao, preparing to attack Datuan. Li's unit, upon hearing the news, immediately took precautions in order to launch a surprise attack. Unexpectedly, at this time, Ding, Fan, and dozens of guards returned to Yangdian Town from Datuan. Because they were in plain clothes and had not notified Li's unit in advance, Li's unit, in a hurry, received intelligence and mistook them for plainclothes Japanese soldiers, and opened fire as a warning. Ding, Fan, and their troops did not immediately identify themselves and returned fire, resulting in a misunderstanding and casualties on both sides.

Li's Attitude. After receiving the report, Li Zhiming, believing that both sides belonged to the same army and unwilling to engage in fratricidal strife that would harm the local population and please the enemy, resolutely and voluntarily handed over his unit to his subordinate Chen to command, and temporarily left the team to petition his superiors for an appropriate resolution. His troops are still stationed in the Fengxian area. It is also reported that the Fengxian guerrilla force has been reorganized. The original detachment commander, Li Zhiming, has resigned, and his troops have been incorporated into the Ding and Yu detachments.

Current Defense Situation. Fengxian County is defended by Li Wenyuan, the first battalion commander under Yu, while the western half of the county is under the control of Ding, who is actively launching counterattacks against the Japanese strongholds in Fengnan and the two counties, in order to coordinate with the Chinese forces active on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line.

### Four Banks of China (Central, China, Communications, and Farmers) Provide One-Yuan Notes as Much as Possible, The Rejection by Silver Shops Is Due to Misunderstanding Caused by Tedious Counting

The Shanghai Banking Association received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, which reported that the bean and rice industry reported that some silver shops in the city have been refusing to accept one-yuan banknotes. The Association replied that after investigation, the banks do not reject one-yuan banknotes and the problem is only due to tedious counting that caused misunderstanding with customers. The final key to this matter lies in the proper adjustment by the issuing bank to ensure supply and demand can be met. The matter has been forwarded to the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks for their attention. The four banks replied that they always accept and provide one-yuan notes as much as possible and do not reject them.

### Strive to Serve the Country During the War of Resistance, Income Tax Should Be Paid Promptly, Merchants in Populated Cities Should Not Delay Payment as it Affects Treasury Revenue

The Ministry of Finance instructed the Income Tax Office, stating that regarding the deadline for filing and paying business income tax, Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax stipulates that the taxable party shall, within three months after the end of each year, report the income amount to the competent tax collection authority in the prescribed format for the income of the first category, items A and B. Rule 26, paragraph 1, of the Implementing Regulations stipulates that the tax payment deadline for items A and B of the first category shall be from March 1st to the end of May or from August 1st to the end of October each year, depending on the annual settlement period of each industry. This tax payment deadline has been clearly clarified by the Ministry in previous orders. It is the final deadline. Before this deadline, all taxpayers should comply with the reporting and payment requirements as soon as the settlement is completed or after receiving a payment notice from the competent authority, and should not delay payment with excuses. This has been instructed to all income tax offices for compliance in Order No. 605 on March 5th, 27th year. Now that the period for the assessment and payment of business income tax for the 27th year is approaching, and the important cities in the rear have been ordered to evacuate the population, it is feared that businessmen in various industries will distort the provisions, intend to delay payment, and fail to fulfill their tax obligations in a timely manner, which is not a cautious approach to tax administration. It is urgently necessary to reiterate the previous order and instruct all taxpayers to earnestly complete the settlement and pay taxes immediately after receiving a payment notice, without delay, so as not to affect treasury revenue. It is also necessary to instruct subordinates to intensify investigation, audit, and collection, so that taxpayers can demonstrate their enthusiasm for serving the country during the War of Resistance. The office has earnestly complied with the order.

### Puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" Attempts to Expand Territory, So-called Development of "Greater Shanghai" Economy, Puppet "District Offices" Established in Nine Districts, Difficult to Achieve Desires Due to Active Chinese Forces

In order to actively develop the so-called "Greater Shanghai" economy, a certain party has expanded the territory of the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government." In addition to the original Shanghai city limits, divided into six districts: Pudong South District, Pudong North District, Nanshi District, West Shanghai, Zhabei District, and City Center District, it has also incorporated the seven counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Baoshan, Shanghai, Jiading, and Chongming into its jurisdiction. Due to disputes over power and interests, the puppet sides of Suzhou and Shanghai have been at odds. Now, it is learned that the puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Government" has failed in its opposition to the plan to seize the seven counties. The various counties are being taken over by puppet officials sent by the puppet "Municipal Government."

Initial Establishment of Nine Puppet District Offices

The puppet "Government" plans to divide the six suburban districts and seven counties into thirteen districts, with a puppet "District Office" in each district. It has been found that a total of nine districts have been established. The list of puppet "District Chiefs" is as follows: Zhu Yuzhen for Pudong South District, Wei Yunshan for Pudong North District, Shen Shijing for Nanshi District, Li Zidong for West Shanghai, Zhang Pinquan for Zhabei District, Xu Chao for Fengxian District, Mei Liyang for Nanhui District, Lu Tieying for Chuansha District, and Yan Gangru for Baoshan District.

Takeover of Chongming, Shanghai, and Jiading Not Smooth

The puppet "Municipal Government" is unwilling to let go of the un-taken Shanghai, Chongming, and Jiading counties, and has sent Dai Jingpei, the "Chief of the Fourth Section" of the puppet "Government," to be responsible for the takeover. Shanghai County has been renamed Beiqiao District, and Zhu Zhongxian, the puppet "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" of the county, has been appointed as the puppet "District Chief." Chongming County has been renamed "Chongming District," and Huang Zhixiang, the puppet "Chairman of the Autonomous Association" of the county, has been appointed as the puppet "District Chief." However, the puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Government" is still making things difficult for Jiading County.

Puppet Orders Difficult to Enforce Due to Active Chinese Forces

It has been found that the Japanese army only occupies a few narrow strongholds in the above-mentioned seven counties. For example, Fengxian County only occupies Nanhqiao Town, Nanhui County only Zhoupu and Xinqiao, and Chuansha, Baoshan, and Jiading counties only control the city walls. Shanghai County is only limited to Minhang and Beiqiao towns, and Chongming County is also limited to a few towns and villages. Most of the land in the counties is guarded by guerrilla forces. Therefore, the puppet "government orders" are difficult to leave the Japanese military strongholds. The so-called expansion of territory is only a superficial exercise. Attempts to develop the economy are even more difficult to achieve.

### Sugar Syrup Impersonates Opium Paste, Conspiracy to Swindle, First Under the Pretense of Sending Gifts, Then Going to Extort Money, One Offender Detained for Interrogation

China Tonic Company, located at 174 Gulou Road, is owned by Fan Fayuan. At 3 p.m. on the 19th of this month, two people suddenly brought a small porcelain jar containing a flowing substance resembling opium, along with a letter, intending to deliver it to Fan Fayuan. Fan was out at the time, and his wife, Ms. Chen, received it. One person left immediately. Ms. Chen opened the letter and found that it was sent by Zhao Shouchang, No. 10, Lion Lane, East Street, Fuzhou. The letter stated that he had now found a job and was entrusting someone to bring a

Jar of Opium Paste

Asking him to find a way to sell it on his behalf, etc. Unexpectedly, two uninvited guests broke in, claiming to be detectives from the police station, who had come to search for opium paste. After seizing the porcelain jar, they made demands, intending to extort 200 yuan. At the time, Mr. and Mrs. Fan were out and did not have this large sum of money on hand, so they only managed to raise 70 yuan and handed it over, promising to pay the remaining amount the next day. In the evening, Fan Fayuan returned home and learned about the above situation. After examining the flowing substance in the porcelain jar, he realized that it was not opium, but sugar syrup.

Realized It Was Extortion

Without a doubt. But after examining the handwriting on the letter, he suddenly remembered that a Zhejiang native named Wang Xi'en had previously tried to sell him opium. At that time, Wang had left a card with the address 18 Shengping Lane, Shufalu, and the handwriting was similar to that in the letter. He summoned Wang to Fan's place yesterday and asked him to write a letter. After comparing the handwriting, several numbers were the same. He reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, and Detective Xu Shutian was sent to arrest Wang and take him to the police station. This morning, he was sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, requesting permission for detention. The court approved detention for seven days for further interrogation.

### Suffering from Severe Gonorrhea, Forcibly Defiled a Young Girl, Causing the Girl to Be Infected With the Disease, Zhang Shicai Detained for Investigation

Zhang Shicai, from Chongming, lives in a kiosk at 54 Laohailu Road. Zheng Huangshi, a Cantonese woman who lives in the same house, has a niece named Lu A'chang, who is only twelve years old. Zhang often played with her. On a certain day of the month, Zhang suddenly became lustful and lured the girl into his room, where he forcibly raped her with sweet words. However, because the girl was still young, her hymen was not broken. However, Zhang was infected with severe gonorrhea, causing the germs of his gonorrhea to be excreted into the girl's vulva, so that the girl was also infected with the disease. At the time, it was not noticed, and the girl kept it a secret. However, in recent days, the girl suddenly developed the symptoms, with pain in the vulva and the need to urinate five or six times every hour, causing her aunt Zheng Huangshi to suspect. She examined the girl's lower body and found it red and swollen. She questioned her severely, and the girl finally confessed everything. She reported it to the Laozha Police Station, and Chinese detectives Song Wenqing and He Renrui arrested Zhang at 9 a.m. the day before yesterday and sent him to the hospital for examination. Zhang was indeed found to have gonorrhea. This morning, he was sent to the First Special Court, Criminal Division 1. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a charge of rape under Article 226 of the Criminal Code. Because the case concerned public morals, spectators were prohibited. After Xiao reviewed the facts, the court ordered a postponement for further verification.

Yuan Xie, a woman from Jiangbei living at 79 Shunde Road, had a 15-year-old daughter, Cai'e, who was studying at Daozhong Girls' Middle School at 564 Avenue Road. Li Liqing, a Ningbo native who worked as a clerk at Ruitai Chang Timber Company at the intersection of Carter Road and Avenue Road, had been making advances on Yuan's daughter as he saw her passing by the door every day. He initially used frivolous words to seduce her, and then even physically pulled Yuan into his bedroom and molested her. On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, Li repeated his old trick, intending to pull Yuan Cai'e in, but Yuan's cousin Yuan Meizhen reported it to her mother when she returned home, who then reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. Detectives were sent to arrest Li Liqing and take him to the First Special Court for interrogation.

Cai Ayou, a Ningbo native in his thirties who resides at 38 Kangle Lane, Kangnuo Road, is an employee of the Yokohama Specie Bank on Nanjing Road, earning over one hundred yuan a month. His family is well-off, so he was targeted by robbers. At around 7:30 a.m. yesterday, four robbers broke in, one holding a handgun and another brandishing an axe. One robber first monitored the actions of everyone downstairs, prohibiting them from making any noise, and then the remaining robbers went upstairs and broke open Cai's bedroom, looting at will. A sum of 150 yuan in national currency was stolen. At this time, Cai was awakened from his sleep and, unwilling to give in, fought back against the robbers, angering them. One of the robbers holding the axe struck Cai's neck with a fierce blow, causing him to fall to the ground bleeding profusely. Afterward, the Gordon Road Police Station was alerted and dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives in a patrol car to investigate. However, the robbers had already disappeared without a trace. An ambulance was summoned to rush the injured to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.

Russian-Jiangxi explorers Bairenuofu, Gesidielufu, Buelaisisuo, Tieshi, and Tiduofu converted a lifeboat into a sailboat in Shanghai last winter and set off from Shanghai, planning to circumnavigate the Nanyang Islands. However, when sailing to the waters off Guangdong, they encountered a hurricane, which destroyed the mast. After many hardships, they finally reached Paiyasi Bay, but were detained by the local authorities. After requesting, they were released and arrived in Hong Kong on the 12th of this month. However, because they had not obtained a port entry permit in advance, they made a special request to the Hong Kong Shipping Administration for leniency, allowing them to moor in Hong Kong for four days. They accelerated the repair of the mast and replaced it with a Chinese-style sail. The mast was repaired on the 16th and they immediately set sail to continue to the Philippines, and will then proceed to the Binjiao. If no accidents occur along the way, they will sail to Australia.

### Puppet "Mayor" Ninghu Transferred

It has now been confirmed that the puppet "Mayor of Shanghai," Chuan Xiao'an, has been transferred to Nanjing to replace the puppet "Municipal Superintendent" Gao Guanwu. Both Chuan and Gao are currently performing puppet shows in Tokyo, so they will have to wait until next month for both parties to take up their new puppet "positions." It is also reported that Gao's family has moved to Shanghai. At the same time, it is also heard that the puppet "Police Bureau" and the puppet "Finance Bureau" are vigorously fighting for Gao to be replaced, or they will also be transferred to Nanjing.

### The First Scout Troop Recalled to Serve in the War Zone, Frontline Members Transferred to Shanghai, Original Members Preparing to Depart

Over 300 members of the First Shanghai Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps who were sent to the front lines have been working with the army since the National Army withdrew west, responsible for rescue, transportation, communications, propaganda, and other tasks. Their footprints have covered almost the entire country. Recently, as the war zone has expanded, the need for rescue personnel to rescue wounded officers and soldiers has become even more urgent. Therefore, member XX has been specially ordered to transfer to Shanghai via the Nanxun line to summon the original cabinet members to go to various war zones for mobile rescue work. Currently, due to the special forces and environment in Shanghai, and the relocation of the addresses of the original members, only 50 or so of the original members have been contacted. They will be ready to depart as soon as everything is in place in Shanghai.

### Egg Shop Dismisses Shop Assistant, Holds Knife to Commit Murder, Revealed Failure, Separately Prosecuted Awaiting Sentencing

Li Henian, a Ningbo native, is 24 years old. He runs a fresh egg business in a bungalow he has built beside the Jinliyuan Wharf in the French Concession. Teng Chengmao, a Shaoxing native, is 22 years old. He used to work for Li but was fired. He now works as a shop assistant in a certain egg shop at 7 Xinhe Road. On the afternoon of the 28th of last month, Teng hid a sharp blade in his sleeve and rushed to Li's place, intending to

Stab Li. At the time, Li was napping. Li's younger sister, Li Yuelian, saw Teng in the hall and asked him what was wrong. Teng, in a panic, turned to flee, but Shi Jiushi (33 years old, Ningbo native, working as a shop assistant at Yongyuan Shipping Company), who lived with Li, heard the noise and ran out and grabbed Teng. While they were struggling, the knife hidden in Teng's sleeve fell to the ground. Shi and Teng both

Tumbled to the ground. Unexpectedly, Teng was injured by the fallen knife and bled profusely. The police arrived and arrested Shi and Teng. Teng accused Shi of using a knife to commit murder. The police detained the two men and sent Teng to the hospital for treatment, while Shi was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. Now that Teng's injuries have healed, he has been brought back by the police. Yesterday, Judge Zhu Chuzhe from the Second Special Court presided over Criminal Division 8 for

Continued interrogation. Yuan Jiahuan, a lawyer for the French Concession Administration, stated the details of the case, prosecuting Teng for intimidation and Shi for assault. Teng testified that he went to Li Henian's place to discuss business and was stabbed by Shi. He admitted to holding the knife to commit murder. Witness Li Yuelian was present in court to

Prove that the knife fell from Teng's sleeve to the ground. He was injured by the knife when he was pushed to the ground by Shi, not because Shi injured him.

The court reviewed the testimony and announced the conclusion, setting the 28th as the sentencing date. The defendants were each allowed bail.

### Woman's Virginity Ruptured, Brothel Owner Punished

Li Wanggu, a Sichuan woman residing at No. 15, Lane 17, Luban Road in the French Concession, previously forced her fifteen-year-old daughter, Li Huifen, to work as a prostitute in the Qunyu Lane prostitute house.

### Youth Plays with Women, Seduces Young Girl into Adultery, Makes a Private Marriage Agreement, Girl is Pregnant and then Abandoned, Mother Files Criminal Charges and Attaches a Civil Suit

Fan Liu, a woman from Jiangyin residing at No. 8 Dong Sheng Lane, at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Edward Avenue in the Public Concession, north of Dongxin Bridge, is 45 years old. She has a beautiful and graceful daughter named Yueying, 19 years old, who is yet to be betrothed. Her father is a businessman in another location, so only the mother and daughter live together. Mrs. Fan has an older daughter who is married and lives elsewhere. On September 26th of the lunar calendar last year, Mrs. Fan returned to her ancestral home in Jiangyin for some matter, fearing that her

young daughter would be alone and without care, so she had Yueying stay with her elder daughter at Wu Xing Lane, Datiebangkou, on Bei Le Road in the French Concession, to have someone to look after her and avoid loneliness. Unexpectedly, Shui Mingda, a 22-year-old young man from Dinghai, living at No. 63 near the elder daughter, whose father, Fu Xiang, is a compradore on the Hai Fu steamship and quite wealthy, caught sight of Fan Yueying's youth and beauty and was captivated. He then seduced Fan Yueying,

luring her to a hotel where they engaged in adultery for three consecutive nights. They secretly made a lifelong marriage agreement. On the fourth day, Yueying returned to her sister and declared that she had become engaged to Shui Mingda, showing her the engagement contract and photographs, saying she would rent a house with Shui that day and was coming to take her clothes and other items. Her sister detained her, telling her that marriage was a major event that required her mother's consent and should wait until her mother returned to Shanghai to make a decision. On February 8th of the lunar calendar this year, Mrs. Fan returned to Shanghai from Jiangyin and went to her elder daughter's home to bring Yueying back, only to learn that Yueying had been

seduced and defiled and that Yueying was already six months pregnant and heavily pregnant. She immediately sought Shui Mingda to discuss marriage, but Shui Mingda, having achieved his goal of seducing the girl, had put her out of his mind and avoided meeting, leaving no way to negotiate a resolution. Therefore, Mrs. Fan, in her capacity as legal guardian, accompanied by her daughter Yueying, retained lawyer Liu Liang to file a complaint with the criminal court of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Shui Mingda of crimes against family, morality, and abandonment, requesting

legal investigation and attaching a civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay compensation of 2,000 yuan for emotional distress and 4,000 yuan for lifelong support. The court, upon receiving the complaint, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, had presiding judge Liao convene both parties for a hearing in Criminal Court No. 2. The defendant was absent and did not appoint a lawyer to appear in court. Only the plaintiff mother and daughter, along with their attorney, were present. After a brief examination in court, the hearing was adjourned until the 27th, and the defendant was summoned to court for questioning and verification.

### Lu Gaojian Meat Shop Suffers Bombing, Fortunately No Explosion

The Lu Gaojian Sauce Meat Shop at No. 143 Tongfu Road in the Public Concession, around 7:50 PM yesterday, was suddenly visited by a young man who inquired if the shop owner was inside. At the same time, he produced a letter from his sleeve, instructing it to be handed over to the shop owner. After speaking, he immediately walked out of the shop. Just as he reached the doorway, another man threw a bomb into the shop, hitting the apprentice's head. Fortunately, it did not explode, only slightly scraping the apprentice's scalp. The shop assistants were greatly alarmed at the sight, and the two young men, seeing their purpose fulfilled, fled to the side. The people in the shop immediately reported to the police, who dispatched detectives to investigate and took the unexploded bomb and the letter back to the police station for filing to track down leads. As for the content of the letter, it reportedly stated that the pork purchased by the shop daily was all from Hongkou, so it warned the shop to be aware.

### The Truth about Xu Xinzhou's Murder: A Moment's Lapse Leads to Severed Head

Xu Xinzhou, the regimental commander of the 3rd Regiment of the 45th Regular Army Brigade, was reorganized by Cai Xiren, commander of the Third War Zone of Jiangsu Province, into the commander of the 3rd Regiment of the Security Force. He is currently stationed in the western suburbs of Shanghai, Xin Zhuang, Qi Bao, and the towns along the Hu-Min Road, with a total of more than 1,200 soldiers in the regiment. They are well-equipped with guns and clothing and have a strong force. They have repeatedly defeated the Japanese army, and the local area relies on them for peace and tranquility. One of Xu's battalion commanders, Tang Ming, disagreed with Xu and defected last winter to Fan Gencai's unit, the 3rd Battalion of the 8th Detachment of the Pudong Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army, as a company commander. Recently, Fan's unit

was ordered to suppress the puppet army of Zhang Miaogen, entrenched north of Dujiahang in Pudong. Zhang, realizing his strength was insufficient, sought help from Xu Xinzhou and incited discord between them. Xu and Zhang were sworn brothers and had a close relationship, so he resolutely agreed. He immediately dispatched the Mu team, and issued a flying order to Jin Fuxiang's unit, the 6th Battalion of the 8th Detachment, with a total of more than 1,000 soldiers, marching in force, using the insignia of the self-defense corps, departed from Puxi and crossed the river to Pudong. However, Zhang wanted to raise the five-color flag, but Xu Xinzhou firmly refused, stating

that he would not be a traitor, but would only disarm Tang Ming to relieve his brother's siege. At that time, Zhou Shixiong and Jiang Jiaju, instructors of the 6th Battalion, were also present and criticized Xu Xinzhou for not being rebellious, and for deceiving them to cross the river. Moreover, Tang Ming was also affiliated with the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army, so how could they kill each other? Therefore, they disarmed Xu's troops, detained Xu Xinzhou, and reported to Commander-in-Chief Ding for instructions. At the same time, they joined forces with Fan Gencai to attack Dujiahang from both sides. The puppet army of Zhang Miaogen was completely defeated and retreated to Sanlintang. It is now learned that Commander-in-Chief Ding has executed Xu Xinzhou on the spot to set an example. According to reports, Xu Xinzhou was 23 years old, from Wengbanqiao south of Xin Zhuang. After graduating from a certain middle school, he worked at the Yutang Public Education Hall founded by Mr. Niu. He was soon sent to the Qibao Town Citizen Training Class as the chief instructor.

After the Nationalist army moved west, he gathered local patriots and joined the 45th Regular Army Brigade as a battalion deputy, and was soon promoted to regimental commander. His father, Xu Ren, also known as Zixuan, graduated from Songjiang Rongzhai Normal School and served as a gymnastics teacher at Shanghai Municipal Chongzheng and other elementary schools. He has always been a family of scholars and farmers. Yesterday's report that Xu's troops committed rape and looting was not true. His execution is a great pity.

### Chuan Xiaohan's "Requests" Ignored by the Municipal Council

The puppet "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiaohan continued to make three unreasonable demands to the Public Concession Municipal Council on the 19th regarding the assassination of Xi Shi Tai. The contents of his "protest" were seen in the 21st issue of this newspaper. It is learned that this document from the puppet "Municipal Government" was printed with a Chinese typewriter. The puppet official document was in the form of an "official letter". It is heard that the Municipal Council treated this new "protest" in the same way as the "serious protest" and "five demands" made by the puppet "Municipal Government" on March 10th, without responding. According to the Zilin Western Newspaper on the 22nd, it also stated that the Municipal Council directors did not convene a meeting yesterday to study this dispatch.

### Drug Den Broken Up in Xujiahui Town

Wang Huikang, the former owner of the Dashengtang Pharmacy at No. 55 Zhenbei Street, Xujiahui Town, a native of Qingpu Baihejiang, is 44 years old this year. Wang was originally a wandering quack doctor with a habit of drug addiction. Last autumn, due to poor business, he closed the pharmacy and specialized in selling drugs at home, supplying them to addicts. His daughter, A Mao, was responsible for transportation. A "swallow's nest" was set up downstairs, and morphine injections were administered upstairs, with the third floor serving as a wholesale point. Business was very good, and the profits were no less than tens of thousands of gold. Recently, the drug enforcement department of the French police learned of this and reported it to the police chief. On the night before last (21st) around midnight, they dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the address. Eleven male and female drug offenders were arrested on the spot, and more than ten taels of opium and morphine were confiscated. However, Wang had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Wang's wife, Gu, was arrested along with the other offenders and taken to the French police station for interrogation. Detectives were dispatched to watch for Wang Huikang, the wanted criminal, to be brought to justice and severely punished.

### Clerk from the Puppet "Municipal Government First Section" Disappears

Qiu, a puppet "clerk" from the puppet "Municipal Government First Section," lived at No. 5 Ji Lu, Pudong. Every morning at 7:00 AM, he took a ferry to Hongkou and then transferred to a puppet "public bus" to work at the puppet "Government" in Jiangwan. He returned home by the same route at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. However, on the day before yesterday (20th), he suddenly disappeared on his way to the puppet "Government." He did not return home that night. Yesterday, his family went to the puppet "Government" to investigate and not only did they not see him, but Qiu's signature was missing from the puppet "attendance book" for both the 20th and 21st. As of last night, his whereabouts were still unknown. The Japanese and puppet authorities fear that Qiu has been captured by patriotic elements and are making every effort to investigate.

She was discovered and detained in the Shengjing steerage by investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang from the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association, together with detective Qu Deming from the water police. The woman Chen Peifang (19 years old from Tongzhou), who bought Ma, was arrested, and sent to the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation and detention. At that time, Wang Xiuying, Bing Sheng's mistress, was in court to listen, and she was identified by Ma as an accomplice of the abductor. She was then arrested by detective Wang Guanchen

and investigated together. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, judge Miao Qingbang from the Special No. 2 Court presided over the trial in Criminal Court No. 1. Lawyer Fei Xizhen, from the French Concession Administration, clarified the case and prosecuted her for the crime of harming the family. The victim, Ma Xiaoqin, accompanied by Chen Shaoting from the Relief Association, arrived in court and said, "On January 10th of this year, I met

Bing Sheng from the same village at the small vegetable market on Kangnaiduo Road. He said to me, 'Your mother has a letter for you, it's in my house, you can go and get it.' I went to Bing Sheng's house, and then I was tricked by his mistress Wang Xiuying to go to Pudong, where I worked as a prostitute for more than ten days. Then I was brought to Shanghai and sold to No. 113 Shiyin Lane, Geluokelu, for 260 yuan. Then I was sent on a steamboat to be taken to Tianjin to do business, where I was discovered on the boat." Ma's husband, Yuan Guigen, was also summoned by the police and claimed that he did not know anything about his wife being abducted. During the interrogation,

Chen Peifang confessed, "This was done by my mother, I didn't know anything about it." She retained lawyer Wang Hengyi to defend her. Wang Xiuying confessed, "I was abducted by my lover. I only went to Pudong once with her, I don't know anything else." After hearing the court's examination and arguments, the court immediately announced the verdict: Wang Xiuying was sentenced to four months in prison, Chen Peifang was found not guilty. Wang was detained in the detention center, and Chen was granted bail.

### Large Quantities of Copper and Iron Shipped to Japan from Songjiang

Recently, the Japanese army has been searching houses for various old copper and iron utensils in Songjiang Nanmen Avenue. Every day, two armed Japanese soldiers supervise dozens of hired vagrants, who abuse their power to search house by house. Anyone who resists will be beaten and humiliated. Therefore, the people there dare not speak out. The collected copper and iron utensils are piled up like mountains. They have now been loaded onto the Shanghai-Hangzhou train and transported to Shanghai, then transferred to Hongkou. Yesterday morning, more than 20 military trucks were loaded and shipped to Japan.

### It is Not Easy to Live in Shanghai, Qingyuli Houses to be Rebuilt, Tenants Appeal for Assistance from All Circles

The houses in Qingyuli, Xin Chongqing Road, were originally the property of the Chaozhou Merchant Foreign Medicine Guild. After the guild donated them to the Poor Children's Education and Care Home, the home entrusted Yifeng Foreign Company to manage the lease, with an annual rent of more than 30,000 yuan, and everything was peaceful. Later, the Shanghai Women's Commercial Savings Bank sought to take over the contract from the Poor Children's Home, paying an annual rent of 50,000 yuan. Recently, the Women's Bank announced to all tenants that they should move out immediately to facilitate reconstruction, leaving the more than 3,000 tenants in the lane nowhere to live. At the same time, it filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court to demand eviction. The first instance verdict stated that during this period of national crisis, it was difficult for residents to find housing, which was a real situation, and both legal facts and reality must be taken into account. Therefore, the court's verdict was suspended. The bank appealed and won the case, agreeing to the eviction. The bank immediately hired workers to build bamboo fences on the day before yesterday to forcibly evict the tenants, and it was said that the water would be cut off soon to enforce the execution. Therefore, the more than 3,000 tenants in the lane were all panic-stricken and appealed to various organizations to uphold justice and provide righteous assistance, urging the bank to postpone the reconstruction.

### Unnecessary Worries

— Xin Yi

Because of the tension in the European situation, the residents of the isolated island inevitably look worried, like the eve of an approaching storm, a kind of uneasy state makes people feel that Shanghai is not a paradise.

Originally, the residents staying in Shanghai, they either came from distant hometowns, because they could not bear the pain of being enslaved by the enemy in the guerrilla areas, and temporarily came here to take refuge; or they had long moved to Shanghai due to the drive of life. After all, they were lucky. Today, when all places have suffered the trampling of the enemy, they can escape from hell and take refuge in heaven, not hearing the sound of artillery and not smelling the smell of ammunition. Shanghai is like a paradise, although they feel inexplicably lost for the long years and limited economy due to the soaring cost of living, but some of the more affluent people live a very comfortable life here, relying on the singing and dancing stages, tea rooms, and theaters, seeming to have forgotten everything.

Hearing the news of drastic changes in the international situation, the first to feel worried are these people who are addicted to pleasure. In their minds, they believe that Shanghai is the most "safe" place, with special protection, a "utopia" of the human world. In fact, they are wrong. When the Chinese nation has not achieved complete liberation, and the country has not achieved complete sovereignty, there will be no so-called safe "utopia". "Utopia" will only exist after the new China is built. Shanghai, as generally thought, is considered safe. Why do people worry so much after the turmoil in Europe? We certainly feel that it is necessary to eliminate their unnecessary worries, because China's protracted war of resistance will not be shaken by the European situation, and the turmoil in Europe will not be related to Shanghai. Although Shanghai is closely related to the world, the most important relationship is not in Shanghai, but we residents living on the isolated island, no one can evade the responsibility of fighting for national survival, and no one can say that it has nothing to do with the war of resistance, because their own safety is temporarily tied to Shanghai, and the country's safety lies in the future of the war of resistance.

If we calmly analyze the current world, we will know that the unprecedented catastrophe of the Second World War is unavoidable. The longer it brews, the heavier it will erupt. We do not hope that other wars will occur in the world to increase disputes, nor do we pray that other countries will participate in the war to share the responsibility. We should only stand on our own positions from beginning to end and fight for anti-aggression and survival. So we don't have to worry about the outbreak of the European war. What's more, due to the constraints of various countries' own interests, there will be no war at present.

In short, I hope that the people living on the isolated island should contribute their energy to our nation and country as much as possible, and strive to pursue a free world and a real paradise in their own positions.

### The "Artistic Makeup" of Inferior Goods

— Zhang Zhenshan

As long as we resolutely refuse to buy, disguises are useless.

In the twilight of economic collapse, using cunning deception to give goods an "artistic makeover" and dump them on foreign markets to obtain raw materials and capital is indeed a despicable and pathetic strategy.

They may think that bringing these goods along with their iron heels is practicing a two-pronged invasion. However, for us, no matter how ingenious your disguises are, they will only deceive us for a moment. We will never believe in them; on the contrary, we will only feel disgust and contempt.

In the interior, no matter where, the people's patriotic enthusiasm and deep national consciousness have made life revolve around the war effort. All daily necessities are mainly domestic goods. Counterfeit goods simply cannot gain a foothold in the interior. As a result, there has arisen a tendency toward imitation and affectation, hoping to pass off the bad as good. Initially, their products merely had the words "Domestic Goods" marked on the outer packaging, while the goods themselves still had very obvious national markings. Now, this technique can be said to have progressed, and even the goods themselves are "beautified." Some even bear markings such as "Made in China" or "Made in Shanghai." The trademarks used are also constantly changing, sometimes using people, sometimes dogs, sometimes pigs. Moreover, they will also use things that can cater to the national psychology as trademarks, printing the words "Purely Domestic Goods," or impersonating products of other nationalities, writing "Made in..." Then, with the help of treacherous merchants who act as accomplices, they are lucky enough to sneak into the pile of domestic goods. However, their actions are not only insufficient to gain market share, but also serve to reflect the steadfastness of the people in the interior towards national concepts, and reflect the full understanding of the people in the interior of the national economy. The more they pretend to be domestic goods, the more it shows the strong patriotic sentiments of the Chinese people. The fact that non-domestic goods cannot gain a foothold in the interior is truly a gratifying thing.

People who live in Shanghai and are familiar with the local situation have a strong ability to distinguish goods, so naturally they are not easily deceived and mistakenly purchase inferior goods. For example, if a certain item is clearly marked "Made in Shanghai," then just think for a moment: Does Shanghai have manufacturers that produce this item? Even if there are, are they operated by Chinese people? Are the raw materials used domestically produced? With such clear and simple identification methods, no one will buy rashly.

However, this is not the case in the interior. Generally, people who do not understand the situation in Shanghai often think that anything "Made in Shanghai" is always a domestic product. Therefore, the remedy is that the authorities must actively implement effective bans.

Therefore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has now telegraphed the provincial governments of Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, and Guangxi to instruct the directly responsible authorities to strictly investigate and ban (see newspaper reports). From now on, all kinds of inferior goods, whether counterfeit, repackaged, or renamed, will probably be difficult to cross this line of defense. There are also clear stipulations for punishing treacherous merchants who repackage and sell them, which will not only have a considerable positive impact on tax revenue, but also provide many conveniences for people in the interior to purchase goods, so they don't have to hesitate. Only domestic goods can be sold, and inferior goods will naturally find it difficult to pass off the bad as good.

In the current guerrilla areas, especially the "isolated island," domestic goods are indeed quite scarce. Inferior goods with counterfeit brands and repackaging can be seen everywhere in the market. There are also many goods that are sold without any "makeup." Regarding this, we can only hope that the general public will destroy selfishness under the banner of public interest, deepen their understanding of the national economy, and be alert to where the firepower that destroys us comes from. If you think carefully, you will believe that "the money in your own hands, with a turn, will be made into a bomb and blow up on yourself..." These words are indeed based on experience. Wake up! As long as we resolutely refuse to buy, no matter how clever they are, their limited skills will ultimately be useless. (Zhang Zhenshan)

### A Group Being Exploited

— Runmo

The Real Life of Flannelette Weavers

Speaking of female workers, everyone immediately has a feeling that it is an extremely arduous occupation. Indeed, female workers are very arduous. Flannelette weavers seem to be more leisurely and less laborious, but strictly speaking, their lives are so austere, their treatment is so meager, and they are exploited by capitalists everywhere.

Not long ago, I visited the ×× Lace Factory on ×× Road once. Inside, there were more than a dozen workshops, with more than 400 flannelette weavers. They were working very diligently, carefully pulling the flannelette threads up and down, and paying attention to the color matching of the flannelette threads. According to one of the female workers, some of them came early in the morning and left very late, and some came very late and left very early. The amount of working time did not matter to the factory, because the amount of wages was based on the number of pieces completed. From the moment they stepped into the door of the workshop to the moment they stepped out, they were working under electric lights, just pulling up and down and matching colors. Although the work was not very heavy, it had to be done very carefully. If they were not careful, they would have to spend their own time re-doing it. Working like this all day long, the faster ones could complete a small piece of flannelette every day, with a wage of 45 cents. After deducting 25 cents for the flannelette money, the net remaining was only 20 cents, so it could only solve one person's food. As for those who were slow, they could only get 3 or 4 yuan a month, or only more than 2 yuan. Although there were also those who could get a full 10 yuan, their working time was considerable, at least 10 hours or more per day. One female worker had been working for more than a year, and now her monthly reward was only 6 or 7 yuan. Just think how harsh such treatment is!

Newcomers to the factory need to pay a registration fee of one yuan, which must be refunded only if they can make a full two yuan in the first month. After entering the factory, they learn on a daily basis. The flannelette that is made during the learning period is all obligatory. Only after the management personnel consider that they can do it can they establish their own account and do it themselves. It is said that the factory values the patterns made as much as precious jade, and does not allow workers to take them out. Every female worker must be thoroughly searched by the factory staff when she leaves the workshop to prevent secret leakage. For the sake of life, they can only endure. Although there is anger in their hearts, they dare not vent it.

Under such circumstances, the previously energetic spirit has become sluggish due to long-term shackles. If they were originally thin and weak, then there is no need to say more. Under the whip of life, they are struggling in exploitation.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 8: Is it Illusion or Reality? Acting on the Stage. It is Appropriate to Act or Cease, Making a Home Everywhere.

China's emerging mining industry mostly belongs to public exploitation, and a part belongs to private exploitation. Because there are really too many mines in the country, the public's power is really a bit too late. However, those major mines, such as iron mines, oil mines, gold mines, and those with few of other countries, such as tungsten and antimony mines, must be controlled, and of course, they all belong to the state. In addition, there are many mines that may be privately exploited, but they are all collective systems and are supervised by the public. Since Mrs. Su Liya came, many people in the mining industry have asked Mrs. Su Liya to invest. With her abundant wealth, it is possible for her to start one or two mines independently. However, she is not very interested in the mining industry. What is related to the mining industry is the transportation industry. If you have abundant mineral resources, it is useless if transportation is inconvenient. For example, a ton of coal is worth only one or two yuan when it is first mined on the mountain. When transported down the mountain, it will be worth seven or eight yuan. When transported to the dock, it will be worth more than ten yuan. When transported to the place where coal is used, it will be worth tens of yuan. This value is not on the coal itself, but on the added transportation. For example, a ton of iron, from the place of production to the place of manufacture, this transportation cost is not even a thousand miles apart in the country. But it is not as cheap as transporting it from the place of production to a foreign country, and then from a foreign country to China. What is the reason for this? It is because transportation in China was inconvenient in the past, and there were many obstacles, such as donations and taxes, which hindered the development of industry in China. Now everyone also knows the importance of the transportation industry, and there are many emerging transportation industries, so someone came to ask Mrs. Su Liya to invest in the transportation industry, but she was not very interested. Because she did not want to hunt for profitable business in China, nor did she want to monopolize any exclusive business, such as trust. Investment is indeed intended to be profitable, but she has to feel interested in doing it. In addition, she is also willing to do a little bit for charitable things. Ten years ago, during the Chinese war, a friend of Mrs. Su Liya, also an American, served in the ambulance team in the Chinese war zone. She once communicated with her, saying that "China lacks tools for transporting wounded soldiers. Like his truck, there are only a small number of them, so many wounded soldiers cannot be transported to the rear hospital very quickly. If it is a minor injury, you can still think of a way, and even there is no car, so you have to walk. If it is a serious injury, there is no truck, so it is delayed, and there is a good chance that your life will be in danger." (93)

### Today Is: Shirley Temple's Tenth Birthday

— (New Film)

One week after Charlie Chaplin's fiftieth birthday is the tenth birthday of Shirley Temple, the only child star in contemporary Hollywood. As usual, once a year, on her birthday, Hollywood is bustling. Today will be no exception, right? What is written here is Shirley Temple's success story over the past ten years and the situation of fans worshiping her.

Birthday Excitement

On April 23, 1929, this child star was born in Santa Monica, California, USA. Since she stepped onto the screen at the age of three, after trying, she achieved great success and became a little star in Hollywood. From then on, once a year, on April 23, there will be a celebration in Shirley Temple's home. The lively scene is endless. Film companies, male and female stars, all give gifts to this little star; at the same time, they also go to her home to participate in the celebration. This kind of grand occasion only happens once a year in the Temple couple's home, and it is not usually seen. Moreover, in addition to home, 20th Century Fox, as usual, will also hold a celebration for this little star.

Generous Salary

At the age of three, Shirley Temple first appeared on the screen as just an extra with very little pay. But at the age of five, she had a weekly salary of $150. Currently, the price for shooting a film is US$100,000. Fox's treatment of this little star is not unkind. Even her mother, the company also gives her a monthly salary of $250 as a reward for taking care of this little star. And in addition to filming, factories that use Shirley Temple's photos as trademark advertisements also have rewards, plus the extra income from radio broadcasting, which is about the same as filming. Therefore, some people estimate that her current assets are at least $2 million!

Filmed Films

According to reports, Shirley Temple used to shoot four films a year, but now it is three films a year. For every film starring her, the company makes money, so it treats her as a cash cow and sees her as more important than the first-class big stars. Every year, it has to write screenplays suitable for Shirley Temple to star in. In Chinese cinemas, in the past five or six years, from "Little Miss Marker", "Curly Top", "The Little Colonel", "The Littlest Rebel", "Stowaway", "Heidi", to the most recent "Little Miss Broadway", Shirley Temple's films can be said to have been shown every one. And this "Little" word seems to have become Shirley's film trademark.

Future Problems

However, it must be said that Shirley Temple is a full ten years old, and she is a precocious girl. On the screen, she seems to be twelve or thirteen years old. In a blink of an eye, her childhood will be gone. And in fact, the box office record of Shirley Temple's films is currently declining compared to her heyday. Therefore, whether Shirley Temple will continue to film in her adolescence is what fans want to know sooner. But about this question, even the Temple couple dare not say for sure, and everything must adapt to the future environment. However, in another two or three years, Shirley Temple will no longer be able to shoot child star films, which no one will deny. Once she leaves childhood, whether Hollywood can find a second Shirley Temple cannot be predicted!

### Gossip in the Broadcasting Circle (4)

— Bi Hua

(2) Storytelling with Musical Accompaniment

Female listeners mostly like to listen to storytelling with musical accompaniment, because its lyrics are elegant and romantic. Female listeners like quietness, so storytelling with musical accompaniment is very popular in the broadcasting circle because of its quietness.

Storytelling with musical accompaniment is divided into two types: big book and small book. Big book is also known as pinghua, which is good at speaking. Small book is good at singing. The most famous big books are Zhang Yulong's "Jigong Zhuan", Huang Zhaolin and Shen Huitang's "Sanguo", Ling Youxiang's "Jintai Zhuan", Xu Jixiang's "Yinglie Zhuan", and Huang Yian's "Xixiang Ji". He Ruhexueyun, Gu Hongbo, Wang Xiaosun, Li Guanqing, Mo Tianhong, Zai Yunfeng, and Zhang Hongsheng are all outstanding talents in pinghua.

The small books are recommended by Lu Fengxiang and Lu Xiaoxiang's "Ten Beauties Picture", Xia Hesheng's "Painted Gold Phoenix", Chen Ruilin and Chen Yunlin's "Mao Family Book", Zhu Yaoxiang and Zhao Jiaqiu's "Red Robe", Zhang Shaochan's "Double Pearl Phoenix", Zhang Jianting and Zhang Jianbang's "Gu Dingchen", Shen Jianan and Xue Xiaoqing's "Pearl Tower", Jiang Yuequan's "Jade Dragonfly", Xu Yunzhi and Yan Xueting's "Three Smiles", Zhu Yaokun's "Legend of the White Snake", Chen Lianqing and Qi Lianfang's "Embroidered Sachet", Zhao Hesun's "Double Butterfly Romance", Yang Zhenxiong and Yang Binkui's "Palace of Eternal Life", Jiang Ruting and Zhu Jiesheng's "Lost Gold Fan", Zhou Yuquan's "Civil and Military Fragrant Ball", Jiang Binchu and Cheng Siyin's "Double Gold Ingot", Yang Yuecha and Yang Xingcha's "Pearl Tower", and others such as Gu Yusheng and Xue Huiqin have considerable status in the broadcasting circle. The various books they sing have different genres and their own strengths. The sound of a group of wandering spirits emitted from the radio is really overwhelming for the listeners.

(3) Stories

Stories are also the most popular programs for listeners. Especially late at night, the later the time, the more people listen. The materials for telling stories are not fixed. Most of them are taken from "Qidong Yeyu" and legendary notes. There are also long stories and short stories, nothing more than martial arts, detective, supernatural, romance, and tragic love. It seems easy to listen to, but it is also very difficult. You must have considerable knowledge and eloquence. Listeners often call the radio station to study historical allusions with the storytellers. The storytellers who are famous for telling stories on the radio include Xu Zhesheng, Gao Yangshan, Fang Zhengpei, Yanghua, Gu Mengchi, Li Zhuan, Chen Yingfeng, Zhao Xiaoxian, Gu Xingyu, Ji Fansan, Cheng Dequan, Lin Fengge, Shen Huitang, Tang Qiaoliulang, He Songyin, Wang Naiming, Pu Menggu, and Fang Nanxuanzhu, members of the Story Broadcasting Research Association. The author also adds a humble role. There are countless others who tell stories on the radio.

### An Overview of the Huqin (Middle)

— Ni Qiuping

Differences Between Families

The Huqin is the only accompaniment for singers, so in addition to its own skills, you have to take care of the singing. Chen Yanheng's pulling Tan School, Xu Lanyuan's pulling Mei Doctor, and Mu Tiefen's pulling Cheng Yanqiu all have unique features. The main purpose is to be strict. Strictness means that you have to make sure that every word is not bad. But when observing from each person's technology, there are also different places. For example, Chen Yanheng wins with smallness, Xu Lanyuan wins with fluency, and Mu Tiefen wins with smoothness. This is in general terms. Detailed distinctions are too verbose. Only Mr. Wang Shaoqing's method is completely different from ordinary people. Not to mention the special and delicate techniques. Let me talk about it simply. Regarding following the tune, sometimes people are single and I am double, sometimes people are double and I am single, grabbing before and making up after, flashing boards and padding words, each has its own method, which is definitely not comparable to the random addition of flowers by ordinary people, which is quite similar to the counterpoint method of Western music. This is that the melody he uses is not the same as the melody of the singer, but there is no Western flavor, but Eastern color. In terms of music theory, it is completely reasonable. (The so-called reasonable means that there is mutual generation and mutual restraint, that is, harmony should be harmonious, and disharmony should be disharmonious.) This kind of thinking should indeed be promoted for a while. It is definitely not comparable to using some Western instruments to accompany Hu Die's singing "Nan Bangzi" and pretending to be foreign goods. Because the main problem of art is still in the spirit. If you use a piano to play "Fan Erhuang", can it be considered an improvement in national music? But then again, when he pulls the erhu, he surrounds the melody of the Huqin, and the result is a very beautiful ensemble. This is probably the first new record in the history of Chinese music.

Opening Method 31st Game

Black First

Reverse Palace Horse Horizontal Vehicle vs. Head-on Cannon

How to Connect the Previous Game

Cannon Eight Advance Two Soldier Three Advance One Cannon Eight Ping Three Cannon Eight Ping Seven Horse Eight Advance Seven Soldier Seven Advance One Explanation

The forward movement of the chariot is a deviation from the line, which has been described in detail before. Now, let me explain its main general formula again. The deviation from the line is entirely to seek luck, without any corresponding certainty, so it is more disadvantageous and less advantageous. Chariot One Ping Two Horse Eight Advance Nine Both sides must move. Cannon Eight Advance Two is the main force of the black side. Hitting the horse or hitting the elephant can disrupt the opponent's line. This one move can affect the whole game. Soldier Three Advance One avoids hitting the horse. Cannon Eight Ping Three hits the elephant. Cannon Eight Ping Seven must go. Soldier Seven Advance One is the target of the cannon, intending to move so that it can make up for the scholar. However, after the cannon, if the black side's attack is successful, then the military nine advances one to send out a horizontal chariot first, and there is no possibility of seizing the first opportunity.

### Oil Cakes Still Rising Sharply Their Own Seats...They Cannot Use It. Relying on Others...Everything is Controlled by Others. The Most Heartbreaking Thing is That Soon There Will Be No Oil for Vegetables and No Fermented Bean Curd for Meals. Chinese People Have Never Encountered Such a Difficult Situation.

The foodstuffs necessary for our lives—soybeans, raw peanuts, and soybean oil and raw oil—are now monopolized and controlled by the Japanese. In the future, the side dishes that the poor rely on for their basic sustenance, such as bean curd, will also be prohibitively expensive and difficult to afford. "No oil for vegetables, no fermented bean curd for meals." The Chinese people may face this day before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. All of this is the result of the fall of the four northeastern provinces and the provinces of Hebei and Shandong. From this, we can see that today's prices in Shanghai have risen by more than 50% compared to before August 13th, making the lives of the masses feel exceptionally difficult. All of this is the pain inflicted on the Chinese people by a poisonous hand. Yesterday, Dalian soybeans rose to a high of 9.5 yuan, Qingdao raw oil was 57 yuan, and Dalian soybean oil rose to 47.5 yuan.

Dalian soybeans were purchased early by some sauce and pickle shops because they were aware that the source of supply was controlled. Speculators also took the opportunity to be active, resulting in a shortage of less than 200 truckloads of chips, and the market saw frequent and dramatic increases. The price opened at 9.15 yuan and closed at 9.5 yuan, an increase of 40 cents compared to the previous day. A total of more than ten truckloads were traded. However, at the close of the market, it was heard that there was mutual dumping of futures in Tianjin. If this is true, the rising trend of Dalian beans may be curbed. Other beans are not related to the overall situation, but the sales in this street are not without influence, so the market price of Chongming sand yellow also rose somewhat. Yesterday, more than 500 packages were traded, with prices ranging from 9.15 yuan to 9.4 yuan. Fifty packages of Pudong medium-sized Du beans were traded at a price of 9 yuan.

The soaring prices of raw soybean oil were unexpected by the industry. In short, making a living under Japanese invasion is no different from the tragic situation of national subjugation. Those who make a fortune from national crisis are still living in a drunken dream, raising the prices of daily necessities both openly and secretly, which is tantamount to squeezing the blood and sweat of compatriots for the enemy. Yesterday, the market price of raw soybean oil saw a new high across the board. Jiaozhou raw oil opened at 42 yuan to 43 yuan, and the Simma price was 55 yuan, with a total of more than 200 pieces traded. Qingdao barrel raw oil was 57 yuan, with 30 barrels properly traded. More than 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded, with prices rising from 45.3 yuan to 47.5 yuan. One hundred large baskets of Lianqi were priced at 45.45 yuan, and more than 300 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were priced at 34.3 yuan. The price of road cargo was 34.3 yuan and 33.7 yuan. Three hundred cans of Yantai hall soybean oil were priced at 45.2 yuan, and one thousand cans of Tianjin canned soybean oil were priced at 45.5 yuan. One hundred pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were priced at 35 yuan, and 50 barrels in barrels were traded at a price of 45.6 yuan. In addition, 50 pieces of seed oil were priced at 44 yuan, and 120 cans in cans were priced at 54 yuan.

26,000 pieces of soybean cakes were exported on the 20th, transported to Yu and Hua.

### Grain Supply and Demand Are Both Clear, Flour is Stable, and Large Quantities Are Shipped North and South Yesterday and Today.

Wheat flour

Yesterday, the spot flour of this factory did not change significantly in the market. Because it was the weekend, the transaction of this customer was still not prosperous. The Beiyang gang continued to be cautious, and the Nanyang zeroing was difficult to sustain. It was even more difficult to start a wholesale transaction. During this slow sales period, the factory felt that the inventory was not much, so it was unwilling to make unnecessary sacrifices. Therefore, the price of the No. 2 flour factory still stood at 4.45 yuan. The supply and demand of No. 3 and No. 4 flour were both silent, which can be said to be available but not marketable. As a result, the total number of transactions of this customer was more than 30,000 bags. The changes in the market still need to wait for the beginning of next week.

However, there were also quite a lot of returned goods on the market, so the market situation was still sluggish. However, the sellers, because of the scarcity of transport, and the scarcity of goods in hand, their minds were firm again.

DuYangJian, with sharp ends and footing, is firmer than the japonica rice market. Since the exchange price is already high, it is even more subject to customer glutinous rice, and YunLu is sluggish, so it is difficult to inquire without cutting prices, and the price has fallen again by 200 to 300 cents.

### After the Sharp Fall of Customer Indica Rice, the Transactions of Wu Indica Rice Are Smooth

After the sharp fall of customer indica rice for several days, although the arrival of sources is still continuous, nearly 3,000 bags were transported by CheLun on both routes yesterday. However, the selling price has been low, which has already attracted inquiries from shops and factories in this street, and merchants and hoarders have also paid attention. More than 3,000 bags were opened yesterday, and the market situation was also stable. However, most of the transactions were for goods with a price of about 12.4 yuan for Wu indica rice. There were few transactions for high Wu indica rice at 12.6 to 12.7 yuan. Jing indica rice, asking for 13 yuan, is still lacking a buyer. Saigon rice has been affected by customer indica rice, and zeroing has also gradually subsided recently. The latter shape may have to tend to be soft.

### Silk and Tea Foreign Silk Continues to Fall Shanghai Market People's Hearts Are Still Optimistic

The foreign silk market is still in a small return, but because the world's silk quantity is rare, the return drop is not too dramatic, and the Japanese and US futures have also shown an upward phenomenon. This is because Japan's green silkworms have not been able to increase this year. This point is reflected in the Shanghai market, which is roughly the same, so although the silk price is in a small return, people's hearts are not decadent, and they are unanimously optimistic. This is the so-called favorable condition to ensure the rise of silk prices, which is caused by the silk platform change.

Buyers are still seeking supplies, while those with limited stock are holding back from selling, leading to talk of a high market price of 50 yuan.

It is reported that the Robbins iron freighter arrived yesterday with over 5,000 tons, unloading and stocking the goods, which is quite busy. This is reportedly the third batch of arrivals.

### Peace! Peace!

— Hu Feng

"Peace! Peace!" Children! You must have heard a lot about it. At the same time, you also yearn for the early arrival of "peace," because your lovely hometown has fallen, your warm home has been occupied, and you have drifted far away to a small, isolated island, crammed into small, pigeon coop-like houses of one or two rooms. Your father lost his job, your mother works as a laborer, struggling to maintain the family's livelihood, constantly hoping that the war will end soon, so you can return to your hometown and live a happy life. Yes, we need "peace," but don't misunderstand, what we need is "victorious peace," not "peace of surrender."

Many days ago, Wang Jingwei shouted the slogan "Peace, peace" to ingratiate himself with others. He spoke eloquently, but the Chinese people soon saw through his treacherous scheme and ignored him. Think about it: Our country has been resisting for more than twenty months, and although we have lost a lot of land, the price they have paid has caused panic in their country. Looking back at our country, we are united and focused on resisting foreign aggression. The guerrillas in the guerrilla areas (occupied areas) are powerful, employing unpredictable tactics to inflict great blows. Recently, there have been large-scale counter-offensives in North China, Central China, and South China, and good news is frequently reported. Final victory is not far off, but Wang Jingwei, lacking ambition, actually made a plea for peace. Is this reasonable? No wonder Mr. Wu Zhihui scolded him for being inferior to elementary school students, which is absolutely true. I think: At the moment when the war of resistance is about to be won, you will certainly not ask for peace and sign a treaty that will destroy the country and exterminate the race. If our country is gone, where will our home be? But look: the Czech Republic in Europe was annexed by Germany because of the war, and Albania was eliminated by Italy because the whole country was not united. These past events are obvious examples to warn us against this kind of wrong mentality. Therefore, we should continue to resist, doing our work in the spirit of "those who have money contribute money, those who have strength contribute strength," and obey the government's consistent national policy, believing in the great spirit of our leader, united as one, to achieve final victory and establish a permanent "peace" in East Asia. This is the real "peace" we need!

### How to Spend a Sunday

— Lu Lishi

Children! At the moment when you meet this magazine, it is a Sunday, and I think you must be very happy, right? Indeed, Sunday is the happiest day.

But, children, have you ever planned how to spend Sunday so that it feels even more interesting? Still burying yourself in homework? Not good! Playing as much as possible? Not very good either! Sleeping for most of the day because you are free? Even worse! So how is it good?

Children, you should remember that the best way is:

You should also prepare to get up on Sunday. In the morning, you have to check your homework from the past week. If there is still unfinished work, finish it quickly. At the same time, you should also think about whether there are things you need to prepare for next week. If there are, you should prepare them as well.

The afternoon is truly your time to play properly after a week. You should play as much as possible. If the weather is sunny and mild, with birds singing and flowers fragrant, you should go with your parents or gather friends to the countryside or a park to admire the beauty of nature. You will certainly gain a lot of good knowledge and absorb fresh air, which will greatly help your studies and health. If you have the opportunity, you and your older or younger brothers can visit your beloved relatives and friends, and you will definitely get unexpected comfort and interest. If you can get your parents' guidance to visit interesting institutions, shops, and factories, then a lot of knowledge will surely run into your little brain. What if it rains? You can also invite some children to have a tea party, play music, tell stories, hold a small exhibition, and invite children to visit. Doing these things one by one will make you very happy.

Children, Sunday is here again. In this beautiful spring, how will you spend this happy Sunday?

### Charlie Chaplin's Childhood

— Wei

If we watch Charlie Chaplin's movies, we all know that he is the world's most intelligent actor. At the same time, he is also the world's most meaningful comedian. He can now be said to be one of the world's richest people. We might think that his childhood must have been very wealthy. In fact, it was not; his childhood situation was similar to that of the most distressed of our readers. We do not need to be discouraged by poverty. As long as we have noble aspirations and can work hard, our future may be even better than Chaplin's. Below is Chaplin's own account, please readers compare it with theirs:

When I (Chaplin referring to himself, same below) was studying in London, I was treated only once a year. That was Christmas. That day, someone gave me an apple and a bag of candy. In the months before, I had dreamed about these Christmas gifts and decided how to handle them after I got them. I wanted to hide them under the belt of my wool sweater, and I wanted to keep them for as long as possible.

At first, I ate a little of the apple's skin. After a few days, I finished eating the skin of the apple. Then I ate the apple itself, a little bit each time, preparing to eat it for two weeks. Next, I started eating the candies. I decided to eat one a day, biting a little in the morning, biting a little in the afternoon, and finishing the rest of the candy in the evening. I never wanted to finish a candy all at once, because then I felt it was a great waste.

Before Christmas, I never had candy or apples. Often on Christmas Eve, I would feel very excited and even forget to make the bed. Most children thought this was funny. However, two people knew I was experiencing a tragedy. They each gave me a candy. I ate these two candies a little each day and finished them after two weeks.

### A Bitter Situation

— Bai Zheng

——Record of Ming'er's Escape, Part 18

In the far east, as the sky gradually turned the color of fish belly white, the Jiangshan ship—Ming'er's big ship—rested quietly for a whole long night on the shore of an unnamed town. Because it was already deep autumn, the days were much shorter. As soon as the sky showed a glimmer of light, the boatmen seemed to get up as punctual as always to prepare for departure.

That blood-red sun, shyly showing a flushed face from among the distant tree branches, half-covered and half-reflected, as if showing a delicate laziness, still not awake. However, people had been looking forward to its light for a full ten hours. It slowly rose from the horizon, even slower than Ming'er's ship, several times slower. But in the blink of an eye, it seemed to rise quickly again. It was truly hateful, using deceptive means to play tricks on people in the world. When the sun changed from blood-red to piercing light, hanging high in the sky from the treetops, the Jiangshan ship had been advancing for a while, heading towards a vague destination, heading, heading.

At this time, a small group of people in the cabin were in a hazy state, almost everyone was not fully awake. Ming'er and his older brother Cong'er were sleeping together in one quilt. On the crowded deck, they were curled up and sleeping soundly. Although they were sleeping like "sandfield fish," crowded, of course, they were, but warm they were. The place where Ming'er was lying was really not very good. To the east was the foot of his mother's sleeping berth, and his head often touched it. The space under the berth was empty, because it was dedicated to passengers' luggage. Although his mother had put a few pieces there, it was still not full. Therefore, he had to be very careful when he lay down, and he didn't sleep very well at home, often rolling off the bed onto the floor. So on the boat, every night when he was about to sleep, his mother would always tell him once or twice to be careful not to fall to the bottom of the boat. So he had to be careful even when sleeping, which was really troublesome. At the end of his head was the place where the awning connected to the hull, leaving a large and wide gap. If he was not careful, the pillow might fall into the water. This made Ming'er dare not use a pillow. He was used to it at ordinary times, but once he lay his head on the hard deck, he would certainly not be comfortable. Moreover, gusts of cold wind mixed with moisture blew on his face from the gap, making him unbearably uncomfortable. So he used a scarf to wrap his head, and the impact of the wind could indeed be avoided, but after a long time, he felt a little stuffy. This was not good, that was not comfortable, he didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The deck was made up of pieces of wood. Unfortunately, other places were very flat, but Ming'er's side was uneven, making him almost burst into flames in his heart. Who was playing tricks on him? In such a bad environment, how could he sleep well? In the pitch-black cabin, the sound of the wind and the waves crashing against the boat inevitably made him think wildly. The more he thought, the more frightened he became, and the more frightened he became, the more he couldn't sleep. His brother's turn threw the quilt on him whole, and the biting wind took the opportunity to attack. Ming'er felt cold and scared, so he suddenly sat up and looked around without any movement. Pitifully, he had to pull a corner of the quilt and curl up to get through the night.

He finally fell asleep when the sky was just beginning to light up. When the boat moved, the deck boards in front were taken away, and the people in the cabin could no longer sleep well. His father asked the boat boss if he could not take away the deck boards at the beginning, but he could not comply, because for the boat to move forward, the helmsman in the back must be able to see the bow, otherwise there would be a risk of running aground. Ming'er could not sleep well at night, and could only make up for his lack of sleep in the early morning. But the boatmen who did not know how to appreciate it had to unload the deck boards, and a large amount of cold wind and air attacked from the bow, waking Ming'er from his tender dream, causing him a burst of annoyance, and reluctantly getting up from the warm quilt.

### Little Wooden Rabbit

— Xiao Xun

This toy is easy to make. The materials are: wooden board, lead wire, round-head nails, paint. The tools are: small saw, knife, drill, nail key, sandpaper, etc.

First, draw the shape of Figure A on the wooden board, and then cut it with a saw. Then, drill small holes in the limbs with a drill, and then use round-head nails to connect the limbs to the body. The nails should be thinner and the holes should be slightly larger so that the limbs can move freely.

The chassis is shaped as shown in Figure B. Open a slot in the middle of a rectangular wooden board, and nail narrow strips on both sides. Then, according to Figure C, fold three sections of thick lead wire like a pencil lead (A is the axis of the front wheel, B is the axis of the rear wheel, and C is used to connect the two upper limbs and the front wheel axis). Then, cut four wooden wheels (Figure D) with a diameter of 5 cm, and then you can start assembling them. Smooth the wooden board neatly.

After the wheels are nailed, use four curved nails (Figure E) to nail them under the wooden strips on both sides, so that the wheel axles can pass through and the wooden wheels can be mounted (as shown in Figure F). The protruding part of the front wheel axle is circled to one end of the lead wire C, and the other end of C is connected to the front end of the rabbit's upper limb. The front ends of these two upper limbs are nailed together with a long nail. (Figure G) The rabbit's two lower limbs are each nailed to the sides of the slot with a nail at their tips (Figure H) to fix them.

After all the parts are assembled, it is as shown in Figure H. In addition, a rope can be pulled to tow it.

The rabbit's body and the chassis can be painted in various colors to make its appearance beautiful! The dimensions in the illustrations in this article are all in centimeters.

### Confucius

— Gu Huiwen, Sixth Grade Student, Le'an Elementary School

Confucius, whose given name was Qiu and courtesy name was Zhongni, was a famous scholar during the reign of King Ling of Zhou in the Spring and Autumn period. His knowledge surpassed anyone's. Now, I will talk about it in three aspects:

First, learning... Confucius's learning was diligent and focused. For example, when we are studying, don't we often think about playing? But he? He was single-minded, sometimes even forgetting to eat and sleep.

Second, engaging in politics... Confucius's purpose in learning was to engage in politics. The purpose of engaging in politics was to save the world and help people, not to plan for his own promotion and wealth. In this short process of administration, the country was already well-governed, nothing was lost on the road, and many lost territories were recovered.

Third, teaching people... Confucius's purpose in learning was to "save the world and help people," but the rulers at the time did not use him, and he could not realize his ambition. So he focused on teaching people, hoping that his students could realize his ideals, so he had as many as three thousand students.

Looking at it from these three aspects, we can know that Confucius was not an ordinary person, but a sage who had never existed in history.

We are now in the era of learning, and we should learn from Confucius's spirit of learning, cultivate the foundation of standing in the world, and strive to save ourselves from the current precarious situation.

### Civics Class

— Gu Huiwen, Sixth Grade Student, Le'an Elementary School

Now I am already in the sixth grade—so, there seem to be more and more complicated subjects than other grades, but I like them all, but I especially like "Civics." Now I will explain the reasons why I like it:

A person living in the world must understand the principles and responsibilities of being a person. In the past, the people of our country often had the habit of "each sweeping the snow in front of their own door, and not caring about the frost on the roof of other people's houses," and simply did not know how to help each other or how to love themselves.

Classmates: We are now the young masters of the country and the future pillars of the country. Let us abandon selfish and self-interested morbidities, strive to help each other and love ourselves, seek welfare for the public, and win glory for the country.

Civics is the course that trains us to be human beings now, and it is also the condition to avoid being slaves in the future.

### The Spider's Lesson

— Zhang Fude, Sixth Grade Student, Zhendong Elementary School

Spring has quietly arrived. I took advantage of the holiday to have the opportunity to stroll around the French Park. Because I hadn't been there for a long time, the whole park had changed to a new scene. The new greenery, as lovely as emerald, made it even more beautiful. The willows by the stream, nestled among the charming red peaches, seemed to be smiling coyly. Walking slowly along the stream, I felt like I had arrived in a paradise.

Sitting down next to a quiet pavilion, I saw a small spider busy spinning silk and weaving a web. Just as it was about to succeed, a merciless gust of wind blew over, breaking its silk. But it was not discouraged. It reconnected the broken parts. When it was about to finish weaving, it encountered another unfortunate obstacle. But it still worked hard. So it went on four or five times. However, eventually, because of its patient weaving thread by thread, it finally weaved a web. From this, I thought of the environment that China is currently facing, which is similar to this small spider. Although we have temporarily moved backward due to strategic relations, we have made considerable progress through the consistent efforts of all of us. The facts seem to be telling us that we must not panic, but move forward step by step, weaving thread by thread with patience. The time when the country will be built and the war will be won is not far away.

### I am a Blade of Grass

— Yang Yi, Fifth Grade Student, Shanghai Girls' School

I am a blade of grass, and my home is in the corner of a wall that people don't pay attention to. My dad is the sun, and my mom is the spring breeze.

When the cold weather arrives, Dad leaves me far away, and Mom leaves early too. I am killed by the north wind, frost, and snow. However, my heart is never dead. When spring arrives, Mom and Dad both come back to take care of me. My heart is revived, I struggle up from the ground, and finally I grow in nature again.

I am a blade of grass, I don't have much strength, but I know how to endure. When the time is right, I know how to exert my strength. You see, winter comes every year, and every year it comes to destroy me, but I am still growing now. Let's see what methods the brutal enemies who destroy us use to make us submit.

### Planting Flowers

— Xiaomai

Dear children, spring has arrived, plants have begun to grow, and the scenery of nature has been renewed. If you go to the fields, you will definitely see many small wildflowers blooming with red and white flowers, dotting the verdant fields, seeming to smile at you, how lovely—

Here I will teach the children a remedy—that is, to cultivate a few small wildflowers by themselves. Although it is not as spectacular as the scenery of the wild, it also has many characteristics: such as increasing plant knowledge and gardening experience is one example...

There are two types of planting wildflowers: potted planting and ground planting. Potted planting is easier in terms of management, so beginners may wish to try potted planting first. Children should remember that most annual herbs are sown in spring and bloom in autumn. Biennial herbs are mostly sown in autumn and bloom in spring of the following year.

Now is spring, which is the time to sow flowers such as cockscomb, morning glory, scarlet creeper, coreopsis, and violet. These flowers are the easiest to cultivate and have very beautiful colors, so I will briefly talk about their cultivation methods:

Cockscomb belongs to the amaranth family. Sow the seeds (directly sprinkle the seeds in the soil) between March and April, and red and yellow flowers will bloom in early autumn, with most of the small flowers clustered on the top of the stem in a cockscomb-like inflorescence.

Coreopsis belongs to the chrysanthemum family, sown in March and April, and the flowering period is from summer to autumn, with long-stemmed yellow flowers blooming. Apply some wood ash when transplanting this flower.

Violet belongs to the cruciferous family, with purple color, very elegant, sown in March and flowers in autumn.

Scarlet creeper and morning glory both belong to the convolvulaceae family, sown between March and April. After germination, a frame must be set up to support them, because they have particularly slender winding stems. The flowering period is very long, from autumn to late autumn, with many colors.

There are several points to pay special attention to when cultivating wildflowers: water frequently without making the soil too wet, preferably twice in the morning and evening. Be sure not to water when the sunlight is strong. The flower pot should be placed in a place with sufficient light, and it should be moved frequently, do not always put it in one place. Apply a little diluted human urine a few days before flowering, too much is harmful. If you can do it in the same way, you can enjoy a very long period in the autumn.

### Snow White (15)

— Celestial Grandson

Seeing the urgency of the situation, the seven dwarfs dared not delay. They hurriedly jumped on the backs of deer and rabbits, rushing towards their cottage with the speed of flight. The small animals were also extremely anxious, taking shortcuts as they ran, and the little crows flew shortcuts as well, all wanting to arrive a little sooner. But the seven dwarfs were still anxious as if the distance was particularly long, as if it were several hundred miles.

But at that moment, something had already gone wrong in the seven dwarfs' cottage. It turned out that Snow White had expressed her wish in her heart and gently bit a small piece of the poisoned apple the Queen had given her. Suddenly, she moaned and fell to the ground as if dead.

Seeing Snow White fall to the ground, motionless, the Queen was sure she was dead. So she laughed loudly and happily walked out of the cottage. She had carried out the deadly plot and completed the murder, eager to return to the palace, considering it a triumphant return.

However, the Queen was too late to leave. The seven dwarfs, riding deer and rabbits, were flying towards them, already approaching the cottage. They immediately spotted an old woman in black clothing coming out. No matter how well she disguised herself, without any flaws, they had already guessed that she must be the evil Queen.

Although the seven dwarfs had arrived at the cottage, they didn't go in to check on Snow White. Instead, they followed behind the Queen. Each of them held a pickaxe, shouting as they chased her into the forest. Although the Queen was disguised as an old woman, she ran very quickly, the black shawl billowing in the wind, spreading out on both sides like a large bat.

The seven dwarfs kept chasing the Queen, sometimes up mountain peaks and sometimes into valleys, now up, now down, now high, now low, unwilling to let go for even a step. Suddenly, they saw the Queen run to the edge of a mountain cliff. Anxious and flustered, she lost her footing and fell headfirst, plummeting straight down. It goes without saying that she would be crushed to pieces and die. Seeing this, the seven dwarfs were overjoyed and cheered together, saying, "Ha ha, from now on she can no longer harm us! Now, let's quickly go back and check on Snow White!"

When the seven dwarfs rushed back to the cottage in a flurry, alas, it was too late! Poor Snow White, as beautiful as a flower, lay stiffly on the ground, having been dead for a long time. They tried their best, using all sorts of methods, to revive her, but nothing worked. She still wouldn't breathe. Watching her soul unable to return to her body, they were helpless. They had to make her a glass coffin, lay her to rest in it, and carve the name "Snow White" below the coffin. They hurriedly carried the glass coffin into the forest and placed it on a grass mound, where the seven of them took turns watching over her day and night for several months. They were still foolishly hoping that the little beauty would one day be resurrected and live happily with them again.
