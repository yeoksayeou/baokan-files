### English and French Governments Reply to Hitler, Reaffirming Their Determination to Continue the War, Fulfilling Their Obligations to Poland Until Justice is Upheld. Chamberlain Criticizes Soviet Actions as Utterly Unjustified.

London – Prime Minister Chamberlain, in a statement to the House of Commons this afternoon regarding the progress of the war, stated that the events of the past week were of profound and significant nature, and their impact on the future of the war and other countries is currently difficult to estimate. Throughout this week, the German forces continued to pressure the Polish army, which continued to resist with all its might. Currently, many parts of Poland are still continuing to fight, and Poland still holds some safe areas as a basis for resistance. For example, Warsaw still refuses to surrender to German forces. An event occurred on September 17 that had a decisive impact on the Eastern Front. On that evening, the Soviet army crossed the border along the entire line and invaded Poland. I cannot describe this action by the Soviet government as unexpected, as the Soviet newspapers and radio had previously announced statements regarding the status of Belarusians and Ukrainians within Poland, indicating that the Soviet government had long prepared for intervention. Recalling the note from the Soviet Union to British Ambassador Sir Seeds, it stated that it would adopt a neutral policy regarding the relations between the UK and the USSR. Therefore, the British government, under these circumstances, issued a declaration on September 18 regarding the Soviet invasion of Poland, stating that no matter how the Soviet actions are justified, they have no legitimate reason. Although the details of this incident are not yet fully clear, no matter what the situation, it is not enough to shake the British government's determination to fulfill its obligations to Poland and to fight with all its strength to fulfill these obligations.

London – When the House of Commons convened at 4 PM today, Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech stating, "The British and French governments have decided to continue the war. The international situation has not changed due to German leader Hitler's speech yesterday. As for the events of the past week, they are of a very significant nature, and their impact on the future of the war and the attitudes of other countries is difficult to estimate at this time. Although the German army continues to pressure the Polish army, the Polish army is sparing no effort in resisting the powerful enemy. To this day, there are still many isolated Polish troops in Poland holding strategic positions to resist the enemy. The unyielding nature of the Warsaw garrison is one example. On the 17th of this month, the Soviet army suddenly advanced along the entire Eastern border of Poland. Although this cannot be said to be entirely unexpected, it is undeniable that it has significantly affected the Eastern Front." (Havas, 20th)

London – Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons at 4 PM that regarding the Soviet army's entry into Poland, the British government issued a statement on the 18th of this month, declaring that Britain is determined to fulfill its obligations to Poland and continue the war, and will not be influenced by the outside world. This stance must now be reiterated. As for German leader Hitler's speech yesterday, it was full of exaggerated and threatening words. This manner of speaking is not something we adopt. It is precisely for this reason that the German authorities find it difficult to understand us. Although I am commenting on his speech, I still maintain our national habit of speaking calmly and peacefully. I wonder if the German authorities can also see this quality. As for the content of Hitler's speech, there is nothing new. The international situation has not changed because of it. Prime Minister Chamberlain then answered an inquiry from Liberal Party MP Mandel, stating, "The British government's goal in deciding to wage war remains to establish a lasting international system to prevent all wars and resolve international disputes through peaceful means." (Havas, 20th)

Paris – Official sources recently announced that the cabinet solemnly declared during a state council meeting this morning that "France has decided to continue the war until justice triumphs over might." The events that have occurred recently are absolutely insufficient to change the attitude of Britain and France. (Havas, 20th)

Paris – The French government has issued a reply to Hitler's speech in Danzig yesterday, stating that the purpose of Hitler's speech was nothing more than to show the German people that his war was a last resort. At the same time, Hitler's speech was also intended to sow discord between Britain and France. However, Britain's guarantee to Poland was entirely the result of Germany's broken promises in annexing Austria and Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, Hitler's intention was to destroy Poland and not just to acquire Danzig. The Nazi Party's various propaganda regarding the treatment of the German minority in Poland is exactly the same as what was used during the Sudetenland crisis last year. This propaganda is enough to prove that Hitler has no sincerity for peace. In short, Britain and France will never allow Hitler to achieve a victory that would enslave the world and destroy human freedom. (Associated Press, 10th)

### Invading Polish Territory, Soviet Troops Continue to Advance, Occupying Vilnius in the North, Reaching Lviv in the South.

Moscow – The Red Army General Staff recently released a battle report stating that our troops continued to advance along all fronts in Poland yesterday. By the evening, they had occupied the following locations: (1) The Northern Route, also known as the Russian district, after fighting fiercely for two hours, had occupied Vilnius, Vileyka, Berdawichai (50 kilometers east of Bialystok), Prudnik Gablin (northeast of Brest-Litovsk), and other cities. (2) The Southern Route, also known as the Ukrainian district, had occupied Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Sokal (on the Bug River), Brody, Busk, Rogatyn, and Duliina. In addition, our cavalry and tank units had begun to reach the northeast and south of Lviv. (Havas, 20th)

London – German official radio stated that since Soviet troops occupied Kuty, the entire Polish border bordering Romania is now under Soviet control. (Reuters, 20th) The Soviet army in Kaunas reached the Lithuanian border in Vyevis yesterday and exchanged salutes with the Lithuanian border guards. It is reported that Polish troops burned all the bridges in Vilnius and moved military supplies elsewhere before the Soviet troops arrived. After the Soviet occupation of Vilnius, civilian militia patrol teams were deployed on the streets and a civilian conference was established. Its first task was to organize a civilian army. (Associated Press, 20th)

Kaunas – It was recently learned that a squadron of Soviet giant tanks charged into Vilnius on Tuesday evening.

Moscow – The General Staff of the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army announced the operational communique for the 19th as follows: "On September 19, Red Army units continued to pursue Polish troops, and by the evening of that day, they had occupied the following locations: On the northern front of Western Belarus, after two hours of fighting, the town of Vilnius was occupied, as well as Vyalikaya Byerastavitsa (50 kilometers east of Bialystok), Pruzhany, Kobrin (40 kilometers northeast of Brest-Litovsk), and other towns. On the southern front of Western Ukraine, the towns of Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Sokal (on the banks of the Bug River), Brody, Busk, Rogatyn, and Dulyny were occupied. Cavalry and tank units have advanced to the northeastern and southern suburbs of Lviv." (TASS, 20th)

, and forced the majority of the Polish infantry to retreat. Moreover, before the arrival of the Soviet army, the sound of gunfire continued throughout the night, demonstrating the fierce resistance of the Polish garrison. It is heard that 50,000 Polish soldiers had crossed the Lithuanian border at around 8 AM yesterday. In addition, another 30,000 Polish soldiers entered Lithuania in organized formations, where they were disarmed and detained by the local authorities. They were all weathered and exhausted. It is estimated that the total number of Polish soldiers seeking refuge in Lithuania will reach 100,000. (Associated Press, 20th)

### French Cabinet Meeting Approves Various Military Measures, Confident of Achieving Ultimate Victory.

Paris – The State Council convened this morning, presided over by President Lebrun. It approved the government's proposed "various military, economic, and financial measures, that is, various measures to continue the war until ultimate victory," and reiterated that Britain and France maintain a united relationship that is "increasingly close." In addition, all cabinet members unanimously expressed their respect for the heroic resistance of Poland, and all believe that Britain, France, and Poland will achieve a common victory. (Havas, 20th)

Paris – Prime Minister Daladier met yesterday with senior military and government officials. It is reported that the meeting decided that although the Soviet Union has invaded Poland, France still intends to maintain normal relations with the Soviet Union. Before the Soviet Union further clarifies its attitude, the meeting decided to submit the resolution to the Cabinet meeting for approval today. (Associated Press, 20th)

### British Information Ministry Issues an Article Denouncing Hitler's Speech as Nonsense and Falsehoods.

London – The British Information Ministry recently issued an article in the form of a public statement refuting Hitler's remarks, calling his words full of nonsense and falsehoods, and stating that it is surprising that someone in a responsible position like Hitler would speak so recklessly and carelessly. The statement compared Hitler's previous statements with what he broadcasted yesterday, saying that Hitler's words yesterday referred to the deceased Polish military leader Piłsudski as a forceful and practical figure who had rejected the Treaty of Versailles with Hitler, but then said that the minority of Germans suffered barbarous treatment and the world remained silent. It should be known that the world remained silent because from the death of Piłsudski until this spring, Hitler had always acknowledged that his relations with Poland were very good. On May 21, 1935, Hitler spoke in Parliament, saying that he recognized Poland as a great patriotic nation with understanding and friendly friendship. On February 20, 1938, Hitler again stated in Parliament that German-Polish relations not only had treaty characteristics, but also had more friendly approaches in the past year, and the League of Nations Commissioner in Danzig was also of high character, and claimed that Danzig, which was most likely to endanger European peace, had lost its dangerous meaning. On September 26, 1938, Hitler also mentioned Poland, saying that in the past year, an agreement had been reached with Poland to eliminate the danger of conflict for ten years. Poland has recently witnessed the shameful act of the German government breaking its solemn guarantee given in Munich, and Hitler's assertion that Germany no longer has territorial ambitions in Europe has also been repeatedly and thoroughly broken. Now that Hitler is telling us about the Soviet Union, he has probably forgotten the words of the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop when he advised Britain to oppose the Soviet Union, telling us how dangerous the Soviet Union is. On January 30, 1937, did Hitler not denounce Bolshevism as a germ in Parliament, asking German workers not to have contact with this international parasite? On September 14 of that year, did Hitler not declare in Nuremberg that he did not want to isolate himself by not cooperating with the Soviet Union, but wanted to protect himself? Even on February 2, 1938, Hitler made a firm statement in Parliament that "there is only one country in the world with which Germany does not want to have close relations, and that is the Soviet Union." Britain does not have the problem of fighting against German women and children. The German government has announced that Germany has sufficient food reserves, and as for the restrictions on the import of military raw materials, it is not a plan that the German government can legitimately accuse. Hitler's description of the situation at the beginning of the war is also contrary to the facts. Germany decided to wage war and hoped that Britain would not fulfill its obligations to Poland. Britain only sent a note with sorrowful beauty to the German government when it did not receive a German reply until two days after the German army invaded Poland. (Reuters, 20th)

### British and French Newspapers Comment: The Depressed Psychology of the German Side, Hitler's Emotions Revealed in His Words.

London – Although Hitler's speech contained dangerous threats, saying that there was a "secret weapon" that could win, the newspapers still considered it to be old news, and several newspapers believed that this speech was not worth answering. The Times stated that Hitler's speech did not need to be answered, but only to be answered in practice. (Reuters, 20th)

Paris – French newspapers criticized Hitler's speech, saying that Hitler could not hide his fear. Le Journal de Paris said, "If the person who provoked the war and hoped for a short and successful end to the war is not disturbed by the fear of a long-term war of attrition, then what is the meaning of this speech? This person can no longer hide his fear." L'Ordre quoted an article by Pertinax as saying that Hitler may soon show his diplomatic means to the countries of Central Europe in order to achieve his goals. Le Petit Parisien said that Hitler's speech revealed a melancholic mood. (Reuters, 20th)

### Rome Watches Quietly, Believes the Hope of Peace is Slim.

The Fascist side in Rome did not criticize Hitler's broadcast speech. The expectations of the Italian people for a peaceful movement and an early opportunity for war have now been extinguished. The general public is eager to stay out of the conflict, but now they are watching with attention. (Reuters, 20th)

Rome – The newspapers here have headlined Hitler's speech in Danzig with extra-large headlines. The comments mostly focus on the point that Poland no longer exists. Il Messaggero said, "We dare not predict the future of the war, but we only know that the current situation requires all parties to seek an appropriate solution to the problem with a spirit of mutual concession and goodwill." Il Popolo di Roma said, "From the current situation, disarmament and peace are still possible, but if the war is prolonged, we will only suffer years of sacrifice and pain, and it is still difficult to hope for a just peace." (Associated Press, 20th)

### American Impression: Germany Adopts a Peace Offensive, Which is Unacceptable to Britain and France.

Washington – Washington believes that Hitler's speech in Danzig is the cornerstone of the expected Hitler peace offensive, which will be implemented by Italy or even the Soviet Union with diplomatic action. The general public's interest in Hitler's decision to speak is not as great as in previous speeches. When Hitler spoke before, there were many people gathered at the National Press Club here to listen. This time, there were very few listeners. Well-informed sources believe that Hitler's speech has revealed his anxiety to avoid a long-term war, but it is expected that Britain and France will reject the peace offensive, because Hitler's proposal will put Poland at risk, and Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia will also feel threatened, and in the near future, Germany will directly attack British and French territories. Those in charge do not believe in the possibility of an alliance between communism and Nazism. (Reuters, 20th)

### Germany and the Soviet Union Divide Poland, Negotiate Border Demarcation, Inevitable Friction Due to Conflicting Interests, Germany Sends Personnel to the Soviet Union to Discuss Military Cooperation.

Swiss Capital – Well-informed sources here recently announced that although representatives from both sides have conducted negotiations regarding the demarcation line between Germany and the Soviet Union in Poland, it has not yet been fully determined. Future friction is also possible. According to news from Berlin, German political figures are very anxious about this, and the expansion of Soviet power in Poland is considered to be of a significant nature, exceeding expectations, and inconsistent with the principles of the German-Soviet agreement. It is observed that the Soviet Union's strategy is to delay the time, making it difficult for the final agreement to be reached quickly, while at the same time occupying certain places that Germany is coveting first, thereby creating a fait accompli. (Havas, 20th)

Cernauti, Romania – The general public here believes that Germany and the Soviet Union have not established any agreement on dividing Poland's "occupied areas," and the traffic line between Germany and Romania will be controlled by the Soviet Red Army. Before the outbreak of the war, Germany had purchased a large amount of wheat and oil from Romania, and its business relationship with Romania was based purely on barter agreements. If Germany is unable to import its industrial products into Romania, then Romania will also refuse to supply Germany's needs. Now that the Soviet army has arrived at the Romanian border, Romania is no longer directly threatened by Germany, and will naturally deal with it with the most resolute attitude. (Havas, 20th)

Moscow – Several German army and air force officers arrived here last night on a special plane from the German headquarters. It is claimed that they are on a mission to discuss with the Soviet authorities various issues of cooperation between the German and Soviet armies in Poland. (Haitong, 20th)

### Soviet-Romanian Contacts, Revising Borders, Hungary Acknowledges Contact with Soviet Army, Soviet-Yugoslav Relations to be Restored in the Short Term.

Rome – According to a reporter from the Italian official news agency Stefani, Soviet and Romanian officers met yesterday on the Polish border and immediately agreed to organize a military committee to restore border traffic. The reporter also said that direct negotiations will be held between Moscow and Bucharest to redefine the new border between the Soviet Union and Romania. Since 1927, the Soviet Union has not sent a diplomatic representative to the capital of Yugoslavia. (Haitong, 20th)

Cernauti, Romania – A colonel of the Romanian army led a delegation to Chertkov, Poland (in eastern Poland) this afternoon to contact the commander of the Soviet army regarding border affairs, but did not discuss any political issues. So far, the city of Kuty, Poland, has not been occupied by the Soviet army, and the Soviet commander is allowing Polish refugees to flee to Romania in the occupied areas. (Havas, 19th)

Rome – A special reporter from the Italian "Stefani News Agency" sent a report from the Romanian border today, saying that the Soviet army's actions in the Polish territory bordering Romania are extremely cautious, and they are trying to avoid violating Romania's neutrality. The commander of the Russian army declared that they had received instructions to strictly observe the Romanian border, so yesterday, two Russian tanks mistakenly entered Romania in Chertkov, and the Soviet officers immediately apologized to the Romanian authorities. (Haitong, 20th)

Budapest – Rumors that the Soviet army has approached the Hungarian border are circulating. Well-informed sources here say that it is possible that the Soviet army outposts have reached the border, but there has been no formal contact with the Hungarian border guards. (Havas, 28th) Belgrade – The Yugoslav envoy Georgievich returned to the country from Moscow yesterday. It is expected that the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia will resume diplomatic relations in the near future, and will send ambassadors to each other in a short period of time. Since 1927, the Soviet Union has not sent diplomatic representatives to the capital of Yugoslavia. (Haitong, 20th)

Editorial

### Japanese Sudden Onset of Anti-American Propaganda

A week ago, U.S. President Roosevelt, in his statement on foreign policy, regarding the Far East, expressed his opposition to the use of force or other means to unilaterally alter the status quo in the Far East. The significance of this lies in firmly rejecting Japan's so-called "New Order in the Far East." Following this statement, there was no apparent reaction from the Japanese government. However, news arrived from Tokyo yesterday stating that several important Japanese newspapers had, on the same day, published articles warning the United States, accusing it of wanting to succeed Britain as the "guard dog" of the Far East, demanding a change in its attitude towards Japan, or else Japan would not hesitate to resort to military force. The words were filled with resentment and threats. Before the Japanese government officially expresses its attitude towards the United States, we cannot merely rely on Japanese public opinion to speculate on Japan's attitude towards the United States. However, under the current strict control of the government over Japanese public opinion, discussions related to foreign relations must be especially cautious. Now, to launch such a strong attack on the United States, which has always been regarded with respect, cannot but be seen as based on some underlying motive.

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has treated the United States differently in the process of creating its so-called "New Order in the Far East." Whenever American interests in China have been damaged by the Japanese military, it has either immediately compensated or apologized, never allowing the incident to escalate. Recently, although the United States has abolished the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty and stopped buying gold, which will have a significant material impact and some spiritual stimulation on Japan, Japan is still hoping to renegotiate the commercial treaty. Before this hope is completely dashed, it seems unnecessary to resort to such threatening tactics. Moreover, the newly appointed Japanese Prime Minister Abe has made harmonious foreign relations his current foreign policy. How could an anti-American phenomenon arise so soon after taking office?

In fact, the emergence of this phenomenon is still due to Japan's active development of its ambitions in the Far East. However, its formation is due to two erroneous concepts: First, Japan mistakenly believes that the European war is beneficial to Japan. It believes that since Britain and France have declared war on Germany, they are no longer able to take care of their interests in the Far East. Moreover, the signing of the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact can avoid military threats from the side in its aggression against China. Originally, the Soviet-Japanese truce may not have much effect on Japan's military operations in China, a point that the Japanese government has already clearly acknowledged. However, it believes that the participation of Britain and France in the European war is the only opportunity to create its so-called "New Order in the Far East." Among the countries with beneficial relationships in the Far East, Britain, France, and the United States are the most important. Now that Britain and France are no longer able to take care of their interests in the Far East, only the United States remains. Therefore, Japan believes that as long as it coerces the United States into submission, its so-called "New Order in the Far East" can be completed successfully.

Second, Japan mistakenly believes that the United States' Far East policy can be abandoned. Japan believes that the United States only focuses on interests. The small favors Japan has given to American expatriates in China in the past, it is confident that it can prevent the United States from fulfilling its treaty obligations in the Far East. It believes that the United States has no political interest in hindering the construction of the so-called "New Order in the Far East." Moreover, since the outbreak of the European war, whether the U.S. Neutrality Act needs to be revised has become a major dispute between political parties in the United States. American isolationists have even put forward the slogan "European borders have nothing to do with us." Japan also wants to take this opportunity to stimulate the emotions of the isolationists with a U.S.-Japan war, asking them to put forward the slogan "What does the Far East situation have to do with us," forcing the United States to abandon its interference in the Far East.

However, things may not always go as planned. The impact of the European war on the interests of the Far East, whether for Japan or China, is still uncertain given the rapidly changing international relations at the moment! Moreover, the Soviet-Japanese truce may not enable Japan to concentrate on its aggression against China. China's war effort relies entirely on its own strength, and its military and political progress over the years has enabled it to resist any Japanese attempts. As for the United States' Far East policy, it has always adhered to the two major principles of maintaining the Open Door policy and preserving China's territorial and administrative integrity. There are complex reasons why the United States has not actively fulfilled its obligations under these two major principles in the past, but it is definitely not abandonment. The purpose of the United States in adhering to these two principles is also to protect its interests in the Far East. The borders of Europe, one might say, have nothing to do with the United States, but the rights in the Far East must be protected. This is not only a matter of interests, but also concerns the security of the United States itself. In the Far East war of the past two years, the damage to American interests has exceeded six hundred cases. How can the United States continue to tolerate this? The recent strengthening of its Pacific defenses and the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty are just preliminary retaliatory measures. However, Japan does not realize the situation and instead attempts to force the United States to abandon its interests in the Far East with a threatening tone. Can such wishful thinking be realized?

The true meaning of modern warfare has been tested in Japan: the consumption of military and financial resources over the past two years has exhausted Japan to what extent! Does it still have the ability to launch a new war? If so, why did it sign the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact? In terms of Japan's need for armaments alone, since the outbreak of the European war, the only source has been the United States. If the United States were to stop supplying, not to mention that the war against the United States could not be realized, even its actions in the Far East would probably be difficult to sustain. The anti-American propaganda in the Japanese press is just a futile attempt because they do not understand the firmness of the United States' attitude.

### German Troops Massing on Belgian and Dutch Borders; British and French Commanders Confer on Cooperation; Little Change in General Situation on Western Front

Paris – Reliable sources report that German troops transferred from Poland to the Western Front have massed on the Belgian and Dutch borders. (Hanchun, Associated Press Special Correspondent, 20th)

Paris – French General Commander Marshal Gamoulin and British Expeditionary Force Commander Major General Goddard met in northern France yesterday to discuss a plan for evenly deploying British and French troops to the front to resist the Germans. British troops in France last night were on standby to move to the front to attack the Germans. British troops will be stationed along the French Maginot Line II along the Belgian border to stop the German advance along that route. The meeting of the British and French military leaders is consistent with reports that German troops have massed in the Rhineland area. (Associated Press, 20th)

Paris – The French Official Gazette announced that German troops launched local attacks on the area east of Brisca-Sas in the southern part of the Sarre basin, but were repelled by French troops. "Enemy aircraft were active in the area." Under the cover of heavy artillery, German troops launched a night attack. German troops first tried using a new type of 16.5-inch naval gun mounted on flat vehicles. German troops actively reinforced the garrison defending the city of Saarbrücken, determined to prevent French troops from invading the city. (Associated Press, 20th)

Paris – General Headquarters has just issued War Report No. 32, stating briefly that "enemy troops have made a local attack on the east bank of the Bris River, but have been repelled by our troops. Enemy aircraft have also been active in the same area." (Havas, 19th)

Paris – Semi-official circles reviewed the German-French border fighting and said that there had been little change in the general situation on the Western Front in the past 24 hours. According to French communiqués, the offensive launched by German troops in the area east of the Saar River was of a nature that would have been called a large-scale attack in the last war, with the intention of familiarizing German soldiers with this type of warfare, that is, attacking under constant artillery fire. However, the fierce artillery fire of the French machine gun and artillery teams ultimately caused the German offensive to wither, and there was no change in the positions. A recent communiqué from the French command stated that the enemy had made a local attack in the area east of the Bres River and was repelled. (Reuters, 20th)

Paris – The famous reporter Maurice recently commented on the situation of the French-German war in the Petit Parisian newspaper, stating briefly: "Germany launched a counter-offensive in two places on the front line the day before yesterday, intending to retake the positions occupied by the French army. The first attack was in the area between the Saar River and the Bris River, at night on the 18th of this month. The second attack was near Métail-sur-Seille on the east bank of the Bres River, around the 19th. The two engagements lasted only two hours and were repelled by our army. Apart from this, the front line is calm and nothing happens. Our army is consolidating the positions it occupied last week." (Havas, 20th)

Paris – General Headquarters issued War Report No. 33 this morning, stating: "The entire line was calm last night, and the enemy artillery only fired on the east bank of the Bras River." French military figures commented on this, saying that the current period is a "period of strategic observation." For two days, the enemy has been very calm across the entire line, except for a local offensive on the east bank of the Bras River yesterday afternoon. The enemy on the east bank of the Bras River launched a surprise attack. Although there was some progress at first, the French army drove them back to their original positions. As for the situation in the Polish war, according to the latest news from that country, Polish troops are still continuing to resist superior German forces in several places, namely in the three cities of Warsaw, Łowicz, and Lviv. (Havas, 20th)

London – There is much speculation about Germany's intentions on the Western Front. The recent movements of the German army clearly aim to drive out the French army occupying the highlands of the Saar River and the Bris River (a small river east of Saarbrücken, deep in the wooded hills) and the Nieder plateau west of the Bris River. The French army in these areas now controls the vast industrial area connecting the Siegfried Line with artillery. The question today is whether Germany, unable to wage a long-term war, will again attempt to use the "lightning war tactics" that won in Poland. Germany announced that its air force has completed its mission in Poland and is now preparing to fulfill its other responsibilities. This is a prelude to the early arrival of approximately 3,000 German Air Force planes on the Western Front. However, it will take weeks to transport the army with heavy equipment to the Western Front. In Poland, the Soviet Union seems to have effectively recovered the land ceded to Germany under the forced Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in the last Great War. It is generally expected that the Soviet Union intends to occupy all of Eastern Galicia. If so, Germany, now only threatened by Britain and France, will certainly not dare to oppose it. According to a Polish officer, speaking to a Reuters interviewer in Szegedy today, it is generally believed that the Soviet Union will try to quickly occupy Poland's oil fields to prevent them from falling into German hands. (Reuters, 20th)

### Polish Government Rumored to Move to France; Polish Army Prepares for Long-Term Guerrilla Warfare; Germans Claim to Have Captured 105,000; Germans Admit Warsaw Cannot Be Taken in One Stroke

Paris – According to sources close to the government, Polish President Mościcki and other Polish officials will arrive in France to establish a government. "Le Petit Parisien" reported that Polish troops will soon begin long-term guerrilla warfare against Germany in order to prevent German heavy weapons from being transferred to the Western Front. French sources said that the Polish 13th Division is still fighting German troops near Khoteło, and other Polish troops are continuing to resist German troops in Modlin, Łódź, Warsaw, Brest-Litovsk, and Lviv. (Associated Press, 20th)

Amsterdam – The news that the Polish government will move to French territory, which the Haida News Agency learned yesterday, has been confirmed today by the "Daily Telegraph". It is said that the French government has agreed, but the location has not been determined. (Haida, 20th)

Paris – The Paris Evening News said that the Polish government may move to France to continue working, as the Belgian government did during the last Great War. However, this statement has not been officially confirmed. (Reuters, 20th)

London – According to a radio broadcast from the Warsaw Defense Command, several Polish cities, such as Modlin, Kutno, and Warsaw, are still in the hands of Polish troops despite the fierce German attacks. It is said that the enemy's attack on Modlin has been repelled. In the Kutno area, Polish troops have broken through the enemy lines and joined the Warsaw Polish troops. In the Grodek area, Polish troops are advancing towards Lviv to relieve the siege of Lviv. The garrison of the Hel Peninsula is still holding its ground. In eastern Poland, there are still several strong units engaged in harassing the enemy. (Associated Press, 20th)

Berlin – A German military expert told a reporter from the Haida News Agency that the preparations near Warsaw have been completed. This attack cannot be completed in a few hours, because occupying a city with a million people is a special task in modern warfare and cannot be taken lightly. German senior generals now want to avoid unnecessary bloodshed among the Polish people as much as possible and have made systematic preparations. The recent convergence of German troops in southeastern Warsaw makes the fall of the city inevitable. (Haida, 20th)

### French Claim to Have Sunk Several Submarines; British Ship "Affolmorea" Suffers Again

Paris – French officials believe that French warships have sunk four or five German submarines. Large French naval units, equipped with artillery and depth charge weapons, are cooperating with the British navy to search for submarines. Semi-official sources say that the results of the current fight against German submarines are even better than those obtained in the second half of 1918, when the German submarine war was at its most intense. (Reuters, 21st)

London – According to the London "Traffic Telegraph", the British merchant ship "Affolmorea", weighing 4,600 tons, was sunk by a German submarine yesterday. Only eleven people were rescued. (Associated Press, 20th)

London – The British ship "Baron Louvart" was attacked by a German submarine yesterday but was not hit. It has now arrived in a domestic port. According to the crew, "We saw a submarine approaching the starboard side of the ship and fired a shot, ordering us to stop, but the captain ignored it and continued to speed up. The submarine immediately sank and began firing torpedoes at the ship, fortunately without hitting it." (Havas, 19th)

Danzig – Yesterday, a heavily damaged German submarine, in a floundering posture, sailed into Reykjavik Harbor, the capital of Iceland. (Reuters, 20th)

Amsterdam – According to an official report released in London, the British fishing boats "Minto" and "Aristo", each about 300 tons, were sunk by enemy submarines yesterday. The details have not been announced. (Haida, 20th)

### "Courageous" Number of Officers and Men Killed Totals 501

London – The British Admiralty yesterday released the fourth list of rescued personnel from the aircraft carrier "Courageous". The number of people rescued has reached 759, and the number of missing is now only 501. The "Courageous" was sunk by a German submarine off the coast of Ireland on Sunday night. (Associated Press, 20th)

### United States Strengthens Far East Strength; Japan Feels Deeply Uneasy; U.S. Fighter Squadron Flies to Philippines

Tokyo – A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to a question from a foreign newspaper reporter today, saying that some Japanese are under the impression that the United States has recently made unfriendly acts towards Japan. Japan's policy toward China has long been decided and has been announced repeatedly. The Japanese government has a firm determination and full preparation to implement this policy. Its purpose is to build lasting peace in East Asia and organize an economic group of China, Japan, and Manchukuo. Some foreigners, even if they do not suspect that Japan will expel all foreign interests in China, are clearly worried. However, this is not the case. Japan fully respects the interests of third countries in China, as long as they represent peaceful and legitimate commerce. Japan sincerely hopes that all countries, including the United States, can correctly understand its purpose and intention. The spokesman also mentioned rumors that the United States has strengthened its Asian fleet, saying that we do not know the motives for this move by the United States. However, what we desire is peace in East Asia and do not want to be involved in the whirlpool of the European war. The United States must also be eager to prevent the European war from spreading to the Pacific region. (Reuters, 20th)

Tokyo – Today, the Daily News reported that since Britain and France are occupied in Western Europe, the United States has taken on the responsibility of looking after the interests of various civilized countries in the Far East. This speculation is based on recent decisions made by the United States, namely: (1) Transferring the aircraft carrier Langley to Manila, (2) Sending 15 heavy bombers to Manila, and (3) Replacing all of the existing submarines stationed in Asian waters with new ones. In addition, there are several other things that prove this: (1) Bringing forward the date of the 1940 Pacific Fleet maneuvers by several months, to be held in January, (2) Immediately starting construction of air force bases in Alaska, Midway Island, Hawaii, and Johnston Island, (3) Widening the Panama Canal. The newspaper also said that the general impression is that the United States will eventually join the French and British side in the war, but opinions differ on the timing of the joining. Some observers believe that the United States will participate in the war within the next four weeks. Other people say that the United States will not participate until after the 1940 presidential election. Still others say that the United States will declare war on Germany only when Britain is fighting unfavorably. The newspaper also said that the United States has accelerated its preparations in all aspects since the Soviet Union and Japan signed the Nomonhan truce agreement and Soviet troops entered Poland. The emergency military measures taken by the United States include the following: (1) Accelerating the naval shipbuilding program so that the two battleships currently under construction can be completed earlier next year, (2) Re-mobilizing some of the ships in the reserve fleet to join active duty within this year, including 110 destroyers, 40 submarines, and 75 other warships, (3) Issuing an order to enlist 75,000 sailors and 7,000 marines, (4) The Navy Department announced that the fleet maneuvers originally scheduled for February and March next year in Hawaiian waters will be held earlier, (5) Establishing counter-espionage and intelligence agencies in Manila, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Panama, and Alaska.

Honolulu – Naval authorities announced last night that a team of naval aircraft left here at 6:30 a.m. yesterday for Manila. It is believed that the team had 15 planes, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel LaHachey. Naval authorities refused to release the flight path of the squadron, but it is speculated that they were flying along the Pan American Airways trans-Pacific flight path. This flight arrived here from San Diego on June 28, when the commander was Lieutenant Colonel LaHachey. The aircraft are painted with the American flag. This flight is the first time that U.S. fighter aircraft have crossed the International Date Line to the west. U.S. aircraft have conducted many exercises in Midway Island, but have never officially flown to Guam or Wake Island. According to unofficial reports, a naval tanker is now between Midway Island and Guam, protecting the aircraft carrier Langley. (Associated Press, 20th)

Tokyo – Mr. Suma Yakichiro, the former counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Washington, arrived in Yokohama yesterday and told a reporter from the Daily News that the American sentiment toward Japan is much worse than is understood in Japan. The phrase popular among young American naval officers is "Never forget the Panay Incident". Asked why the United States abolished the trade agreement with Japan, Suma expressed his opinion that the China Incident has caused many missionaries to lose their jobs. These people stirred up American women and have a great influence on public opinion. Another important thing is that the American Navy has an unusually bad feeling towards Japan. Japan is a large customer of American goods, so he believes that Japan should suggest concluding a new commercial treaty with a very frank attitude and not guess the attitude of the United States.

### Japanese Government Prevents Price Increases; Implements National Mobilization Law, Articles 11 and 19 of Chapter VI

Hong Kong – Tokyo dispatch. In order to prevent prices from rising further, the Japanese government today announced an order implementing Articles 11 and 19 of Chapter VI of the National Mobilization Law, prohibiting prices, freight, wharfage fees, insurance fees, rent, handling fees, and wages from exceeding the market price of September 18. Domestic house rent and land rent will be reduced to the rental rate of September 4 last year, and those in Korea will be reduced to the rental rate of December last year. The effect of the ban does not apply to export trade. (Special dispatch, 19th)

### New York Exchange Situation; Pound Sterling Sees Slight Rebound

New York – At the close of the New York foreign exchange market today, the price of the British pound rose slightly, recovering from the low of $3.77 yesterday to $3.91. It is said that this was due to the fact that U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau threatened last night to find a way to crack down on the two-tiered price market. However, many quarters believe that today's pound sterling rally may not have any direct relationship with the remarks of the U.S. Treasury Secretary or official intervention. The reason is probably that the forward selling of neutral European countries has dried up. The French franc, Dutch guilder, and other European currencies have all risen slightly today, but the Italian lira remains weak. (Reuters, 19th)

### Stimson and Others Conduct Anti-Isolationist Propaganda; Advocate Revising Current Neutrality Law; Roosevelt to Appeal to Congress Today

Vandenberg will meet with the President and other members of Congress at the White House today. He stated that he would demand that the arms embargo clause be retained, as this clause can keep the country out of conflict more safely than the "cash and carry" plan. (Associated Press, 20th)

### Japan Declares No Armed German Vessels Allowed

London – Official circles announced that the Japanese naval authorities have notified the British naval attaché in Tokyo that Japan will not allow German vessels in its ports to be armed, as this would violate Japan's neutrality.

### The Key to War and Peace in the Future Depends on Britain's Attitude; German-Soviet Division of Poland Does Not Allow Interference from Other Countries; If Germany Is Forced to Fight, It Will Definitely Deal with It Accordingly; Full Text of Hitler's Speech

Danzig – Führer Hitler delivered a speech here this afternoon. The main points are as follows: (1) Declared that Poland's future will be entirely decided by Germany and the Soviet Union, because both countries have vital interests in Poland. Germany and the Soviet Union will never allow Poland to return to the form of the Treaty of Versailles. (2) Germany and the Soviet Union are determined to promote friendly relations and create a situation in which Western European democracies have nothing to gain. Therefore, anyone who believes that a conflict will occur between Germany and the Soviet Union is completely wrong. (3) Hitler claimed, "I and the German nation have no intention of fighting against Britain and France. The true purpose of those who incite war in Britain is to overthrow the current German government, but the German people have always been educated in National Socialism. It is wishful thinking to expect them to overthrow this system. However, although Germany has no intention of fighting against Britain, if Britain continues its inhumane war of blockading women and children, then Germany may be forced to resort to arms. However, this matter is determined by Britain." (4) Finally, Hitler solemnly declared, "Danzig will forever be a part of Germany and will never be separated from Greater Germanic Germany." (Haitong, 19th)

Danzig – Führer Hitler delivered a speech at 5 PM this afternoon in the largest square in the city of Danzig. After the administrative commissioner of Danzig, Forster, gave an introductory speech, Hitler took the stage and spoke, first expressing his joy at setting foot in Danzig. He then said that although this was his first visit to Danzig, Danzig had belonged to Germany for five hundred years before the white people migrated to New Zealand. Unfortunately, the World War separated it from Germany, and the Treaty of Versailles plunged the world into chaos. Those who incited the war and those who cleaned up the mess after the war were deceiving themselves in the same way. Not only did they fail to solve any problems, but they also created countless difficulties and disputes from this peace. Germany will sooner or later rise to solve the aforementioned disputes, but it is only a matter of time. One of the most important things is that those who were domineering at the time completely ignored the facts. Regardless of whether the British warmongers are happy with us or not, the people of Danzig are still alive and cannot be hidden from the eyes and ears of the world. And now Germany, which has 82 million Germans, regardless of whether the warmongers approve of us or not, these 82 million people have a common desire to live together and will live together. All the areas ceded to Poland, their development was due to the work of the Germans. According to the results of the plebiscites held at that time, no one wanted to be a part of Poland. However, Danzig was ultimately a victim of madness, and Poland became a product lacking rationality.

Hitler then commented on Poland's past 20 years, forcefully stating that Poland's creation was due to the sacrifice of millions of lives, the sacrifice of land cultivated by Germans, and the sacrifice of all reason and economic possibility. Moreover, the Poles could not maintain the culture created by the Germans, because only those who can create culture have the ability to maintain culture. Poland is a country composed of many ethnic groups, just like the former Austria. The suffering suffered by the Germans over the past 20 years does not need to be described in detail. In a word, "It is a tragic fact."

Hitler mentioned at this point his initial efforts to follow a peaceful path to solve the Polish problem, as well as the agreement signed with the late Polish President Marshal Piłsudski, believing that this agreement was the foundation for promoting peaceful understanding between the German and Polish nations, and that at least the Treaty of Versailles could be used to seek the establishment of reasonable friendly relations. When Marshal Piłsudski was alive, these efforts seemed to have a prospect of success. However, after Piłsudski's death, the situation changed drastically, and the oppression suffered by the Germans became increasingly severe. However, the whole world turned a blind eye and deaf ear to it. Germany is a great power, so it is intolerable for the Germans to be abused by inferior countries. This is a situation of oppression and rebellion. What is even more reprehensible are the following situations: (1) Preventing cities of German character from joining Germany and using various methods to Polonize them. (2) Provinces separated from the German mainland have no direct transportation and must rely on Poland's goodwill or cunning. No great power in the world can tolerate this state of affairs as long as Germany.

Hitler mentioned the suggestions he made to Poland, saying, "I carefully considered and was responsible for presenting this solution to the Polish government. I made this suggestion to avoid the war between the German and Polish people." After elaborating on the details of the suggestions, Hitler declared, "I do not know what Poland's intention is in rejecting this suggestion, but I know that the Germans feel relieved. Poland's reply was to order mobilization. The Polish Foreign Minister rejected my invitation and refused to come to Berlin to meet, but went to London for negotiations. Therefore, in the following months, the threat continued to increase, which was intolerable for any great power."

Hitler continued by saying that Polish newspapers often demanded the annexation of East Prussia and Pomerania and that the Elbe River should be the Polish border. Poland firmly believed that if its military strength was insufficient to realize this plan, it could obtain assistance from other countries. However, the countries regard Poland as a tool to achieve their goals. Now they are singing loudly that the main problem is Germany's system, not Poland. You should remember my speeches in Saarbrücken and Wilhelmshaven. In these speeches, I mentioned several countries where civilians can freely make speeches and talk about the necessity of war, such as Churchill, Eden, and Cooper. I pointed out their danger because I did not know when they would organize. Currently, they have joined the government. I warned the German people at the time but was convinced that Germany would never succumb to their threats and violence. The war movement is gradually developing in democratic countries, because freedom of speech allows foreign governments, politicians, and even heads of state to be attacked, slandered, and insulted at will. However, totalitarian countries emphasize discipline and will never allow this kind of phenomenon to occur. The agitation of war can be carried out in undisciplined countries, but not in disciplined countries. Therefore, the people of undisciplined countries are incited to fight, while the people of disciplined countries do not know how to prepare for war. Therefore, Hitler decided to warn the public and place the country on a defensive foundation so as not to be attacked.

Hitler commented on the situation in August, stating, "I firmly believe that if there was no British guarantee and the agitation of those who worship war, an understanding could have been reached at that time. Britain suggested direct negotiations between Germany and Poland. Germany accepted this suggestion, but Poland continued to refuse." After months of waiting and repeatedly making suggestions, he decided to "use the only language that Poland understands." Hitler mentioned Italy's mediation, saying, "Italy is our friendly country. After Mussolini made a suggestion for mediation, France accepted it, and Germany also agreed, but Britain refused and wanted to make an impossible demand to Germany with a two-hour ultimatum. However, Britain has misunderstood. Today's Germany cannot be regarded as the Germany of 1918. London should recognize that it cannot deliver an ultimatum to today's Germany. Germany will never tolerate this tone."

I know that when Poland decided to go to war, it thought that it could obtain political and financial benefits in this war and was incited by the statistics of Western European politicians, that is, the German army is not to be feared, the German army's equipment is inferior, the morale is declining, the people all have a mentality of defeat, and the German people are opposed to the leaders. Poland firmly believes that it can not only resist the German army but also defeat the German army. Therefore, with the assistance of foreign staff officers, it prepared for war against Germany. However, only 18 days after the start of the war, the German army had advanced to the line of Lviv and Brest. The Polish army in the Kutno area completely collapsed and was captured. The number of prisoners yesterday morning was 20,000, last night it was 50,000, and this morning it was 70,000. It is completely unknown how much the current number has increased. But I am sure that if the Polish army west of the Lviv-Brest line does not surrender in the next few days, it will be completely annihilated. The German army has taught this smart politician a lesson. They also know the situation in Germany well. General Smigly-Rydz has gone in the wrong direction, just like other Polish leaders. He did not fly to Berlin but to Cernăuţi. Polish soldiers fought bravely, but the junior officers lacked military knowledge, and the senior leaders were completely incapable. Currently, there are 300,000 Polish soldiers in German prisoner-of-war camps, including 2,000 officers and several generals. However, we admit that the bravery of the Polish junior soldiers is commendable, but some of Poland's actions are so vile that they are unparalleled in the world, such as the abuse of German women and children, gouging out eyes, and cutting off noses, and the torture of German prisoners of war. The Polish government's radio station has openly admitted that German airmen who parachuted down were killed by Polish troops. However, I have not heard any politicians in democratic countries protest against this barbaric act. If this is tolerable, what is not tolerable? I would like to repeat and reiterate that this situation cannot be maintained for long. "Now we have crushed Poland in 18 days and created an environment in which we can have reasonable and calm talks with representatives of the Polish nation."

Hitler then spoke at length about German-Russian cooperation, declaring that the Soviet Union, in order to protect the interests of Belarus and Ukraine, believed that it was necessary to send troops into Poland. As for the cooperation between Germany and Russia, Germany maintains its original appearance, and Russia also maintains its original style. However, the two countries agree on one thing, that is, not to fight each other, so as to prevent the Western countries from profiting from it. We have tasted the experiences of the four years of the World War. From now on, we are determined to defend our own interests, and the understanding between the two countries is sufficient to completely achieve this goal. The British politicians have repeatedly spread rumors that Germany's political ambitions will encompass the Ural Mountains, and even said that their decision to fight against Germany is to overthrow this government that wants to dominate Europe. The British politicians are obviously uneasy. I would like to take this opportunity to solemnly inform the British politicians that Germany has no ambition to conquer Ukraine. The Soviet Union and Germany have reached an agreement, and Britain can no longer worry about Germany's ambitions. As for how Poland should be constructed, this matter should be decided by Germany and Russia, whose vital interests are at stake. Germany's limited but unchangeable demands have been known to the whole world. Germany and Russia should do their best to turn the source of the European conflagration into an area without tension. If the Western countries do not agree, or Britain is determined to wage a three-year or five-year war, then my reply is as follows: Germany has accepted the current borders as the final borders. I have no desire to fight against Britain or France. Since I came to power, I have done my best to establish close relations with the enemy countries in the European War and have successfully eliminated the friction between Germany and Italy. I have also made the same efforts for France. After the Saar issue was resolved, I solemnly declared that there was no need to modify Germany's western border. I have also repeatedly made efforts for Britain, trying to establish sincere friendship. If Britain refuses and really wants to fight against Germany, then I can make the following reply:

Poland can never return to the form of the Treaty of Versailles. Not only does Germany guarantee this, but the Soviet Union also guarantees this. Then the true purpose of Britain's war is not to protect Poland, but to overthrow Germany's current government. It must be known that the German people have been trained in National Socialism and can never accept the system advocated by Churchill, Cooper, and Eden. If the enemy wants to engage in a three-year war, I am very sorry for the French soldiers. They have nothing to ask for and only know the glory of fighting for three years. If a three-year war really breaks out, then Germany will never succumb, whether it is three years, four years, or even six or seven years. Britain relies on its superior navy and imposes a blockade on women and children. They must not be mistaken, because if Germany is forced to use a certain weapon, I am afraid that the British navy will not know what to do. As for how to fight the war, we will decide according to Britain's methods. Britain is not fighting against the German government, but against German women and children. Then Germany will also repay the British in the same way as the British treat others. In short, Germany will never succumb. We are determined to deal with it to the end. Danzig, after 20 years of separation, has now returned to Germany and will never be separated from the motherland again. The entire German people will defend it with their last breath. (Haitong, 19th)

By dusk, Japanese infantry, under the cover of artillery fire, invaded southwards in two groups: one group attacked the Dajiaoling of the Chinese army, Yaomeizhou along the ancient road from Yueyang to Xinqiang, and the other attacked the Lijiawan of the Chinese army along the ancient road from Taolin to Xinqiang. Dajiaoling, Lijiawan, and Yaomeizhou are all located on the riverbank opposite Xinqiang, which are the forward outposts of the Chinese on the northern bank. At that time, the Japanese were fierce and brave, with the appearance of clearing this triangle area in one fell swoop and attacking Xinqiang directly. After the Chinese army fought bravely to meet the attack, they engaged in hand-to-hand combat until dawn and finally defeated the Japanese army. On the morning of the 19th, the Chinese army inspected the battlefield. Nearly 2,000 Japanese corpses were left in the triangle area. In this battle, the contributions of a certain battalion of the Zhao division of the Chinese army were particularly outstanding. A certain private Zhou of the aforementioned battalion killed six Japanese soldiers alone, and countless others killed three or two Japanese soldiers. A certain company created the highest record of independently killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers in one night. (Dispatch on the 19th)

### London Rumors: Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan Plan to Divide Europe and Asia; The Soviet Union Continues to Aid China

London: According to unverified rumors here, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan are currently planning to divide Europe and Asia, with Germany controlling Europe, the Soviet Union dominating India, and Japan dominating the Far East. However, according to reliable sources, Japan's hope that the Soviet Union would cease its aid to China is bound to fail. Even if the Soviet Union and Japan establish a non-aggression treaty, the Soviet Union's trade with China, including trade, will not be affected. Furthermore, according to Chinese sources here, China's resistance against Japan has made it impossible for Japan to implement its policy of aggression against the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Chinese side is confident that Moscow will continue to aid China. According to another message, the Soviet Union is currently planning to sign a treaty with other countries to prevent the intrusion of German forces into the Black Sea region.

### Ministry of Education: Compilation and Distribution of Teaching Materials for Mass Education. Over 2,000 Copies Distributed in the Last Two Years

(Chongqing News) The teaching materials used in promoting supplementary education for illiterate people are of utmost importance. The Ministry of Education has paid special attention to the compilation of textbooks. In the past two years, the ministry has approved and distributed over 2,000 copies to various provinces and cities. The progress of this work is outlined below: (A) "Textbooks for People's Schools": The textbooks for the national language course in people's schools were prepared at the beginning of the Six-Year Plan. The content carefully selected materials on civic knowledge, music, and other subjects, compiled in a mixed format. The entire series consists of four volumes, suitable for four months of use in elementary people's schools. (B) "Teaching Methods for People's School Textbooks": The teaching methods, closely related to the textbooks, were compiled immediately after the people's school textbooks were completed. All four volumes were completed in April of the 26th year (of the Republic) and printed and distributed to various provinces and cities for application. (C) "Arithmetic Textbooks and Teaching Methods for People's Schools": For the arithmetic courses in people's schools, the Ministry has compiled two types of teaching materials: "People's School Written Arithmetic Textbook" and "People's School Abacus Textbook," each in one volume. Each type also has a corresponding volume of teaching methods to meet the needs. (D) "Musical Song Teaching Materials for People's Schools": The teaching materials for music and songs in people's schools consist of selecting rhythmic texts from the textbooks, totaling fifteen lessons, and matching them with musical scores for combined teaching with the texts. To facilitate learning and dissemination, gramophone records were made for all songs. Expert Zhao Yuanren was invited to create the scores and record the songs, which were distributed to various provinces and cities for use and played in movie theaters. Songs such as "Self-Defense," "Resistance," "Love the Country," and "Reading is Good" have been widely sung by the general public and spread for a time. (E) "Textbooks for Advanced People's Schools": After completing the textbooks for people's schools, the ministry continued to compile textbooks for advanced people's schools, totaling four volumes. They are now completed and undergoing trial teaching. (F) "Wartime Textbooks for People's Schools": The aforementioned textbooks for people's schools were compiled before the War of Resistance. There were certain concerns regarding the ideological aspects. After the July 7th Incident, to meet wartime needs and achieve rapid results, another type of textbooks for people's schools was specially compiled for application. This set of textbooks is divided into two volumes and can be used for two months of teaching in short-term people's schools. The printing of the above textbooks was undertaken by various printing houses, including Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, Zhengzhong Book Company, World Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, Datong Book Company, Beixin Bookstore, and Xinguang Printing House. They were distributed to various provinces and cities in two installments each year. After the compilation of the Type B textbooks for people's schools, the domestic transportation was affected by the war, making delivery quite inconvenient. The Ministry of Education provided subsidies for the printing costs as appropriate.

### A Contribution to Students Applying to the National Southwestern Associated University (Part 2)

— (Sent by Shen Jiayou from Kunming)

When students first arrive, they can stay at a hotel near the station for one night. The next day, they can go to the main office to complete the procedures and then move into the dormitory, which is more appropriate. The Provincial Department of Education has a Youth Hostel located in Jinghong Elementary School on Fuzhao Street. Students who do not wish to or cannot stay in a hotel can contact the hostel.

Regarding the journey, the shortest route from Shanghai to Yunnan takes seven days – two days by postal ship from Shanghai to Hong Kong, two days by postal ship from Hong Kong to Vietnam, and one day by train from Vietnam to Yunnan (Michelin Express). There is a one-day stopover in Haiphong and Hong Kong. Usually, due to waiting for trains and ships, it often takes about two weeks. If you take a Taikoo ship from Hong Kong to Shanghai, it takes four days. Shantou is the most troublesome place along the way. Students are not experienced travelers, so luggage is easily lost here. When the ship is about to dock, be sure to put all loose items and luggage together and adhere to the principle of "never let go of anything." Only after these porters, who can also be described as opportunistic thieves, have left can you enjoy the scenery. I was taught a lesson by them, so I hope the students pay attention. When you arrive in Hong Kong, you can see some exotic flavors. Your passport must be signed by the French consulate. The mountain cable car is a unique feature of Hong Kong and worth a ride. Kowloon is just across from Hong Kong. If time permits, you can also take a ferry to visit. The Hong Kong-Vietnam section does not have dangerous docks like Shantou, but you cannot ignore the Annamese thieves. After all, it is foreign goods, and stealing fountain pens is their specialty. In Haiphong, a reliable hotel can take care of your luggage and take it to customs for inspection. Tianran Hotel is the most influential. Your luggage can be inspected first. Once the inspection is complete and everything is correct, you have overcome all the difficulties from Shanghai to Yunnan. At this time, you can plan your train journey. Although the Michelin Express is fast, it is not suitable for students with luggage. Generally, taking the fourth-class slow train is more economical and allows you to carry more luggage. You need to change trains in Hanoi or Jialin. The latter allows you to arrive in Kunming a day earlier, but the scenery of the former is better, and it is worth visiting. You need to get off the train and stay in hotels in Laogai and Kaiyuan. The luggage can be taken care of by the station, so you can rest assured. There are many mountain caves along the way. Students in poorer health should prepare a wet towel to avoid coal gas. After arriving in Laogai, the opposite side is the Chinese border, known as Hekou. In Kaiyuan, you can see countless strong men being trained. At this time, you will feel like a child who has been wandering abroad and is returning home, with indescribable joy. But when kind relatives and friends wave their hats to greet you, don't be too shy to speak!

The most important thing when passing through foreign countries is your passport. If you get it in Hong Kong, it will cost six Hong Kong dollars, which is very uneconomical considering the current exchange rate. Therefore, if you have relatives or friends in Yunnan, it is better to ask them to get it for you. It only costs four yuan, which is much cheaper than in Hong Kong. If two people come together, you can take a group photo and apply for one passport together, which can save you half the cost.

The most difficult and troublesome part of the journey from Shanghai to Yunnan is the inspection in Haiphong. It often leads to emptying boxes and losing things, which is expected. The fines are also at the discretion of the customs officers. They take what they like, so it is best to bring less of what can be saved. It is advisable to avoid new items, but if necessary, bring as much as possible, because prices in Kunming are frighteningly high. Even with the fines, it is sometimes cheaper. Place small items at the bottom of the box during inspection, and keep important items in your pocket for safety. Students who can speak French can take great advantage at this time. Therefore, if possible, please bring a French group certificate signed by the school, which may reduce some trouble. The boxes should be opened by yourself during inspection, so keep the key with you to avoid temporary confusion. The China Travel Service publishes travel guides, which can be used as reference for purchasing tickets and selecting ships. If you want the agency to provide accommodation, you can contact them. Finally, I wish you success in your exams and hope you come soon. (The End)

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Fluctuates, HSBC Lists Increase Across the Board, U.S. Dollar Black Market Reaches Seven Yuan

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC listings increase across the board due to the sudden rise in the US-British exchange rate. The British exchange rate rose by 0.025 to 3/4 shillings and 75 pence, while the US dollar rose by 0.0625 to 6.125 yuan. With the exception of the German exchange rate, which had no market, all others increased uniformly. The internal market opened in the morning, and the situation showed signs of tightness for the British pound and stability for the US dollar. Although various rumors in the market gradually dissipated during the day, people still felt uncertain, so fluctuations were frequent, making it difficult to predict the situation. Generally, the situation was loose at first and then tight. Initially, because Chinese merchants and banks competed fiercely and foreign banks' appetite to buy was weak, the market was quite loose. The British pound once reached 4 shillings and 375 pence, and the US dollar broke through the 7 yuan mark, reaching 7.125 yuan. Later, a certain bank's appetite to buy suddenly increased, aggressively buying at low prices. In addition, Chinese merchants and banks also stopped selling aggressively, so the situation suddenly returned to normal. As a result, the British pound closed at 4 shillings and 25 pence, and the US dollar closed at 6.875 yuan. Because the settlement period for this month's futures was approaching, there was a squeeze, and sometimes the selling price of foreign banks was the same as the spot price. The price difference between the spot price and the October futures initially followed suit, with the US dollar rising to 7 yuan, but then gradually returned to normal. According to the noon closing, the price difference between the spot price and the October price was 0.03125 for the British pound and 0.1875 for the US dollar, with a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of only about 2.7%. Moreover, it was actually difficult to obtain, so arbitrageurs disappeared. Trading was still active for half a day.

The result was stable for the US dollar and slightly tight for the British pound.

Early morning: London large contracts, recent up 0.0875, distant up 0.08125, New York silver price up 1.75 points, London gold fixed, exchange rate stable against US and France, strong against Shanghai by 0.0375, US back up 9 points against British pound, up 7 jiao against Shanghai, large 5 points against French franc, central bank listed all exchange rates like frenzy, banks opened morning spot selling price, British pound 4 shillings 25 pence, US dollar 6 yuan 875 pence, compared to the previous close, British tight 0.09375, US no honor, is the US British exchange rate back up, a certain bank first absorbed fellow banks October British pound 4 shillings 21875 pence, then daily bank settled fellow bank spot British pound 4 shillings 21875 pence, and spot US dollar 6 yuan 8125 pence, as a slightly soft state, HSBC listed, British exchange rate up 0.025, US exchange rate up large 0.0625, other uniform increase, and silver balance tax revealed continuous rise of 4.75 points, then Chinese businessmen suddenly made fierce sell, and Chinese banks also sold, and because foreign banks do not eat the stomach is not good, so the potential trend to loose, a total of Chinese businessmen spit to foreign banks spot British pound from 4 shillings 28125 pence, up to 375 pence, and spot US dollar from 6 yuan 9375 pence, hard up to 7 yuan 125 pence, Chinese bank Shanghai sold to a certain bank October US dollar 7 yuan, then a certain foreign bank suddenly absorbed the stomach to turn better, and Chinese banks and overseas Chinese also came to fierce, absorbed the addition of Chinese businessmen also from selling to digging, resulting in the situation suddenly saw the return of soft, a total of Chinese businessmen and Chinese banks successively into foreign banks spot British pound from 4 shillings 3125 pence, shrunk to 25 pence, and then叉与 foreign firms dug into a certain bank and other American banks spot US dollar from 6 yuan 9375 soft to 8125 pence, noon as a flat state, extended to noon collection, bank spot selling price, British pound 4 shillings 25 pence, US dollar 6 yuan 875 pence, this month with the same price, October British pound 4 shillings 21875 pence, US dollar 6 yuan 6875 pence, the results compared to the previous day, spot British tight 0.09375, US no honor, this month British expensive 0.0625, US but loose 0.0625, afternoon Wednesday no market,

### Cash Suddenly Dropped in the Evening

Yesterday's cash market, due to the many twists and turns in foreign exchange, and with people's hearts erratic, the day's changes were still dramatic, roughly first pouring and then soaring, but the initial opening was still stable, opening in the morning at 3,910 yuan. After a certain gold shop pushed up, it continued to rise to 3,940 yuan. Afterwards, foreign exchange both official and black market suddenly loosened, causing a selling wave. Money changers and others rushed to sell at market prices, and in addition, most retail long positions also sought to sell, so it plunged downwards, plummeting to a low of 3,750 yuan. However, it was very temporary, and then a certain gold shop's long positions added leverage at low prices, the situation returned high, and soon encouraged by the foreign exchange return tight, and the previous day's peaceful air, most believed that it was difficult to achieve from the front, and then the Hong Kong gang suddenly bought, so the price then reversal soared, up to 3,990 yuan peak, but because 4,000 yuan eye price sellers are crowded, resulting in the rise of the wind frustrated, noon closed at 3,970 yuan, afternoon situation slightly stable, early will retreat to 3,945 yuan, after someone a certain gold shop on behalf of customers aggressively, again up to 3,990 yuan, but the result was 3,980 yuan closing, compared to the previous back up 40 yuan, heard that after closing due to a certain negative news, a sudden fall of the wind, fell back to 3,900 yuan inside, trading is still旺, 2,000餘兩, silversmiths are finally挂小五元, customs gold and other fixed as before,

### Securities. Domestic Debt Firm and Rising. Bulls Take Profits and Sell. Weakness Returns Slightly in the Afternoon.

Trading in securities on the grey market yesterday saw sustained interest. However, a considerable number of investors were taking profits. As a result, market prices failed to surge forward. Moreover, the international situation remains unpredictable, which has significant implications for China. Major players are closely monitoring developments, awaiting official news. Yesterday's trading saw an initial rise followed by a decline. Category C shares briefly broke through the 45 yuan mark, but the market then retreated. Morning purchases focused on the 20th and 25th issues, as well as shares of Da Feng and Tong Kang. Da Tong and Lian Yi saw some selling, with retail investors dominating the rest of the trading. Market sentiment weakened in the afternoon, and fewer buyers entered the market. Lian Yi continued to be sold off, and Ren Chang and Yu Ji also saw selling. Prices retreated by a few jiao (tenths of a yuan), resulting in a slight overall increase of two to three jiao. Total transaction volume still exceeded one million yuan. A summary table is provided below.

Stock Transactions: 20 shares of Guohua Bank were traded at a price of 38.5 yuan per share.

The Public Chamber of Commerce reported that yesterday's stock market saw little change. The recently announced final dividend of 5 yuan per share for Hong Kong and Shanghai Wharf and Godown Company shares coincided with general expectations, thus having no significant impact on market conditions. Jardine Matheson Textile shares suddenly fell in the last half hour, reportedly due to rumors that the interim dividend payment was uncertain and unlikely to occur in the near future. Without other significant underlying factors, these rumors are likely to manipulate the market for some time.

London, 19th. Today's listed prices for Far East British company stocks were calm for both banking and rubber shares. Shanghai Waterworks A shares and Shanghai Insurance shares opened for the first time today. Waterworks shares were priced at £10, the same as the lowest price at the end of last month. Insurance shares opened at £19, a decrease of £3 from the previous price. The rest have not yet opened.

London, 19th. Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained the same for the three types of British and French loans, with stable market conditions. The rest have not yet opened.

### Yarn and Cotton. Conflicting Rumors. Cotton Yarn Sees Widespread Selling. "Double Horse" Yarn Falls 33 Yuan, "Earth" Yarn Drops 25 Yuan.

The yarn market continues to decline, and the downward trend is intensifying, mainly due to conflicting rumors and uncertainty in the market. At the same time, sales in the South China region remain sluggish, with all purchases being small, scattered transactions. The market is generally listless and lacking momentum. Overinflated prices are causing instability under the shroud of rumors. However, well-capitalized players are still buying on dips when the market falls sharply. The lowest price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn reached 735 yuan. Sellers then repurchased, bringing the price back up to 760 yuan. The current situation suggests a small pullback, as raw cotton arrivals are robust and prices are easing.

The yarn market is now weak and sellers are dominant. The opening price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn is down 15 yuan at 780 yuan. Warehouse receipts are falling more sharply, down 25 yuan to 700 yuan. Shortly after, news of a drop in gold prices spread, and selling pressure intensified, pushing prices down further. The spot price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell to 735 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 680 yuan. As the closing bell approached, positive news emerged, and the yarn market rose 20 yuan. A mid-day transaction tally showed that 1,275 bales were sold. 20-count "Double Horse" fell 33 yuan, "Double Earth" fell 25 yuan, "Five Goats" rose and fell 10 yuan, and "Shepherd" fell 7.5 yuan. The sales volume for various merchant groups is listed below.

### Unimpeded Supply from Northern Jiangsu. "White Bag" Cotton Falls 10 Yuan.

Trading in "white bag" cotton continued unabated today, but sales were not as strong as in the past. Market prices continued to trend downward, falling by 10 yuan. This is because the supply from northern Jiangsu is unimpeded, and there are expectations of further arrivals. The reason is that prices in the interior are extremely cheap. If transported to Shanghai, the profits would be enormous. As a result, everyone is scrambling to gather and transport cotton, leading to a surge in recent arrivals. Factories, seeing the unimpeded supply, are relaxing their purchasing efforts. As a result, 3,000 to 4,000 bales continued to arrive at the docks today, and everyone is waiting and watching. Opening prices were held until the afternoon before trading began, and the market fell 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Not all bales were sold. Another account suggests most bales were sold. The drop in cotton prices is not surprising, as 20-count "Double Horse" cotton yarn has fallen by over 100 yuan in the past two days. The opening price for top-quality Tonghua cotton was 160 yuan. Assuming 142 yuan, the drop is only 18 yuan. If the cotton yarn is calculated proportionally, there is still potential for further declines. It is also reported that cotton is being transported directly to Shanghai from all directions. However, it is said that the cotton purchased by Fuh Chia is likely being shipped to the Qingdao textile mill. Yesterday, 860 bales of cotton arrived from Beisha. The current cotton situation is as follows:

Another report: Trading in imported cotton in Shanghai has been quiet recently due to widespread rumors. All parties are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. However, Japanese merchants are still actively ordering new cotton, although less so than a few days ago. Yesterday's asking price for White River cotton was 172 yuan, and for Pingguoer cotton, 125 yuan. Transactions were scarce. The general opinion is that cotton prices will continue to rise in the coming days, so traders are unwilling to sell at low prices.

Imported cotton prices: New York cotton prices were weak in the early morning due to widespread selling, falling 4-5 points. Later, due to firmer stock prices on Wall Street, cotton prices also rebounded slightly. By the close, prices were not much different from the previous day. Indian rapid cotton is predicted to fall 4 rupees, Egyptian cotton to fall over 30 points, and Liverpool cotton to fall over 10 pence.

### Grain. New Xian Rice Arrives in Shanghai in Bulk. Traders Are Eager to Unload. Asking Prices Fall Sharply.

Yesterday, no Du Geng rice arrived from the He Xia region. However, over 7,000 bags of new rice from various locations continued to arrive via the Che Lun Baozi route. The continuous flow of arrivals has further weakened market sentiment. Coupled with recent price controls, business at retail stores is slow, and the sales market is also sluggish. Traders with large inventories are eager to unload. The market opened weakly and continued to decline, without any signs of recovery. As a result, thick Geng rice fell by about one yuan, and new sharp rice fell by one to one and a half yuan. Specifically, top-quality Chang Geng rice was 41 yuan, top-quality Xi Geng rice was 39 yuan, high-quality rice was 37 yuan, medium-quality rice was 35 yuan, and Su Tong Kun Geng rice was 34.5 yuan. Early and late rice from the He Xia region were relatively firm due to the lack of arrivals, and fell slightly by half a yuan, to 31.5 to 31 yuan. The original bags were 34 yuan. New Geng rice from Kunshan, Minhang, Zhuanqiao, and Zhoupu fell by two to three yuan due to the large number of arrivals and the soft consistency of the rice, making it difficult to maintain prices. Kun Min Zhuan Geng rice was 30 to 29 yuan, and Zhoupu Geng rice was 28 to 29 yuan. Kunshan Xiang Geng rice, being a seasonal specialty and only available in quantities of 20 to 30 dan (approximately 1000-1500 kg), opened at 40 to 39 yuan. New Yangjian rice from Kunshan, Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Jiashan was 26.5 to 26 yuan, Tuanjian rice was 26 to 25.5 yuan, Lingbaijian rice was 27 to 26.5 yuan, new Jiangbei Jian rice was 25.5 to 25 yuan, new Wuhu Jian rice was 24.5 to 24 yuan, Chen Jian rice was 25 yuan, Bian Yuan rice was 34 yuan, and Hong Kong high-quality Tuanli glutinous rice was 35 yuan. Medium-quality pointed-grain that rice was 34 yuan. The total volume of transactions in the market was over 5,000 bags.

After the previous market shifted positions, new Jiangbei Xian rice and other varieties arrived in bulk yesterday, and Du Xian rice from Jiangsu and Zhejiang also flooded in via the Che Lun route. Buyers lost their appetite, and sellers, fearing further price declines due to rumors of improved transportation and the influx of new Xian rice from various locations, were more eager to sell. As a result, the middle price of each type of rice fell by nearly one yuan, and the high-end price also fell by more than half a yuan. High-quality Ke Xian rice was 26 yuan, and the middle price ranged from 25 yuan to 23.5-6 jiao.

### Flour Mill Prices. Opening at 7 Yuan Cash. Wheat Is Also Weak.

Yesterday, flour mill prices for spot flour fell by two jiao, opening at 7 yuan cash. This is because retail sales on the Lianbai Ben Street were weak, and customers from both the North and South were waiting for previously ordered goods to be loaded. New transactions were not strong, and the market was also affected by the dumping of Japanese flour. As a result, various mills had to make concessions. It is said that returned goods also fell with the mill prices, dropping below the 7 yuan mark. Prices for foreign flour were also easing due to weak overseas reports. Total transactions in the market, including those by domestic and foreign customers, totaled just under 20,000 bags. 5,000 bags of flour were shipped to Singapore today.

The wheat market was even more depressed yesterday due to the continuous arrival of goods and the wait-and-see attitude of mills and merchants. Although Japanese mills were buying, they were suppressing prices severely, causing the market to slump.

### Dried Goods. Tianjin Red Dates Are Scarce.

Due to the lack of inventory of Tianjin red dates in the market, they will soon be out of stock. Therefore, traders are asking for extremely high prices. Date kings are priced at 200 yuan, date heads at 160 yuan, top-quality dates at 120 yuan, and second-quality dates at 70 yuan. Retailers find these prices too high, and there are few transactions. It is said that sellers are planning to switch to cash-only sales for future goods.

### Oil Market. Japanese Merchants Dumped Future Soybean Oil, Causing Another Drop of 2-3 Yuan.

The soybean oil market was shrouded in negative news and the impact of Japanese merchants dumping future oil. (Japanese merchants learned their lesson in the first half of the year and rarely engage in future oil trading.) This caused buyers to hesitate and the market sentiment to slump, falling another 2-3 yuan from the lowest price of the previous day. Only 80 barrels of Kobe oil were traded (priced at 57.4 yuan), and 20 barrels of Dalian oil (priced at 56.8 yuan).

### Piece Goods. Retail Autumn Sales Begin. Customer Purchases Are Also Strong. Prices, However, Are Falling.

Yesterday, the domestic cloth market continued its downward trend due to widespread rumors and anxieties. Stockpilers were inclined to sell, and the resumption of shipping to Wenzhou suffered a setback. Although another attempt was made to sail, the hope was slim. Affected by this, the cloth market saw selling prices decline step by step. White goods, fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth fell by 1-5 jiao per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by 2.5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece. Velvet and non-fading cloth prices were relatively stable. Retail sales in Ben Street began for the autumn season, and business was quite strong. However, due to falling prices, everyone except those with urgent needs took a wait-and-see approach. Demand was especially strong in Northern Jiangsu, Ju Ning, Qinzhou, and Bengbu Gaoqiu. Transactions included over 5,000 pieces of khaki, serge, colored cloth, and printed cloth. Southern merchants and Hong Kong merchants purchased several thousand pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, red foreign-label printed cloth, and bleached and dyed cloth. Guangdong and Ningbo merchants purchased over 100 boxes of colored twill, colored cloth, serge, and other goods. It was found that 117 pieces of cloth were shipped to Singapore today.

The morning market for Eastern piece goods saw a sharp drop in white goods, due to falling yarn prices and panic among stockpilers. Everyone was rushing to sell. The smallest price for top-quality fine cloth was 21.6-7 yuan per piece. Later, because Ben Street merchants still had good intentions and were buying on dips, 400-500 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill were traded, and prices gradually rebounded. As a result, top-quality fine cloth was 22.15 yuan, and fine twill was 21 yuan. The current spot price for broker-held goods of Sijunzi serge was only 6 jiao 5 fen per yard, while the future price for next month was 7 jiao 5 fen, attracting many buyers. Therefore, although the market was weak, it was still firm.

### Sugar Market. Foreign Sugar Falls Again.

The sugar market continued its downward trend yesterday due to unabated rumors. The public market was marked at 54.5 yuan for 24 coarse white, falling 2.3 yuan. The initial marking for foreign warehouses was 54 yuan, falling to as low as 53 yuan, before recovering slightly to 53.5-4 yuan, resulting in a fall of 2.5 yuan. Transshipment held its original price. Taikoo's B-mark cane white initially ranged from 60 yuan to 59.5 yuan, 59 yuan, and 58.5 yuan, before finally settling at 59 yuan, falling 3 yuan. H-mark cane red was 43 yuan, 42 yuan, and 42.5 yuan, down 2.5 yuan. Dutch red spot was 44 yuan, down 2 yuan, and transshipment was 37 yuan, down 1 yuan. Ben cotton white was down 1.5 yuan. Zhenji No. 1 was 55 yuan, No. 2 was 54.5 yuan, No. 3 was 54 yuan, and No. 4 was 53.5 yuan. No. 1 rock sugar fell 4 yuan, to 66 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 67.5 yuan. Although the source of domestic sugar was scarce and asking prices remained high, merchants were hesitant to buy due to the high prices and risky market, resulting in a lack of transactions.

### Metals. White Lead Sheet Rises to 800 Yuan.

The main market for white lead sheet has always been battery factories, but construction companies and tea merchants also purchase it in significant quantities. However, merchants from other ports, only Ningbo and Wenfu areas buy a little bit, but only two or three dozen buckets each time. Since the outbreak of the European War, the source of this commodity has been cut off (white lead sheet is produced in Poland and Belgium), and the stock in Shanghai is not abundant. Therefore, those who hold this commodity are becoming firmer in their resolve and are increasing their prices step by step. Currently, the market price is 800 yuan per bucket for No. 2, 780 yuan for No. 3, 770 yuan for No. 4, 760 yuan for No. 5, 750 yuan for No. 6, 740 yuan for Nos. 7 and 8, and 780 yuan for Nos. 9 and 10. The asking price for thick patterned sheets is also around 800 yuan.

### British and Japanese Military Zones. Boundary Changes Scheduled for Tomorrow. Henan Road as the Dividing Line. Municipal Council Issues Official Announcement Yesterday. Japanese Puppets Occupied Yu Yuan Road Li Zhao Fang Again Yesterday.

Japan's moves regarding the Shanghai International Settlement have been opportunistic and ongoing for some time, only constrained by the complexity of international relations. Since the Jinluoke incident in Western Shanghai on August 19, the Japanese have supported puppet organizations to begin seizing control of the extraterritorial road administration. Following the outbreak of the European War on September 1 and the declaration of war on Germany by Britain and France on September 3, Japanese actions have become even more assertive. On September 6, they demanded that Britain and France withdraw their troops stationed in Shanghai. On September 9, they sent police to invade extraterritorial roads. On September 14, they demanded that commanders of foreign troops stationed in Shanghai adjust their defense zones. Although the details have not been publicly disclosed, the British military zone in the International Settlement is, in fact, one of Japan's goals. For the past week, there have been rumors that the British military zone north of the Suzhou River may be in question. Yesterday, the facts were revealed in two ways: first, a portion of the British military zone north of the Suzhou River will indeed be transferred to the Japanese starting tomorrow, as confirmed by both British and Japanese sides; and second, Japanese and puppet activities in the extraterritorial roads of Western Shanghai have become increasingly blatant. Yesterday, they occupied Li Zhao Fang on Yu Yuan Road again. Although the authorities are unwilling to give up police power, they are helpless against the Japanese and puppet's arrogant actions. In addition to sending more detectives and patrol cars, it seems that they are awaiting a reasonable solution to this case. The situation yesterday is recorded below.

Defense Zone Change Confirmed

According to the Municipal Council, starting September 22, the boundary between Zone "A" (Japanese Naval Landing Force Defense Zone) and Zone "B" (British Military Zone) will be changed to North Henan Road, restoring the original boundary from before 1937. North Henan Road will remain within the British Military Zone. The section of land affected by this boundary change is only a small portion, bounded by Baizi Road to the north, North Jiangxi Road to the east, the Suzhou River to the south, and North Henan Road to the west. The barbed wire barricades currently on North Jiangxi Road will remain in place and will not be moved. This boundary change has been agreed upon by the respective naval and military commanders. Pedestrians in the affected area will not need passes and will not be subject to any restrictions. The Municipal Council Police will continue to exercise police power, although Japanese Naval Landing Force soldiers may occasionally be seen patrolling the area. It is expected that residents in the area will not experience any inconvenience due to this boundary change and will receive full protection.

British and Japanese Sides

According to a Japanese military spokesman at a reception for Western reporters a few days ago, the area between North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road was originally garrisoned by Japanese troops before the war. After the war, the Japanese troops withdrew, and the International Settlement and British troops entered. In June of this year, the Japanese side requested the British military authorities to restore the original pre-war status. After repeated negotiations, both sides reached an agreement on the 11th of this month, stipulating that the British troops would transfer the defense from the 22nd, remove the obstacles at the east end of North Jiangxi Road, and allow the Japanese troops to extend the patrol area to North Henan Road. This is entirely a defense zone issue between the British and Japanese sides and has nothing to do with the plan to adjust the defense zones discussed at the defense meeting convened by the Japanese side in Hongkou on September 14.

Settlement Police Power Exercised As Usual

Well-informed foreign sources stated that recently, the Japanese side requested that the section of the defense zone from Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road be placed under Japanese military jurisdiction. After repeated contacts between the Japanese and British military authorities, an understanding has now been reached. Starting today, the British troops will withdraw from the section, but police power in the section will remain as before. All Municipal Council Police will continue to exercise police power as usual. The obstacles placed by the Japanese side on North Jiangxi Road will also not be moved to North Henan Road. Residents will not need to carry Japanese passes. Therefore, there will be no significant changes in general. However, the Japanese troops will now have the right to patrol the section.

Japanese Troops Previously Surveyed the Terrain

At 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, one British soldier, accompanied by four Japanese officers, traveled in a car and dismounted at the northern end of Tianhougong Bridge to survey the terrain of the eastern section of North Henan Road. In order to understand the actual situation, a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency went to inspect the area again at 7 p.m. yesterday and saw that everything was as before. The junctions of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, the end of North Jiangxi Road and Baizi Road, the junction of North Henan Road and Jielu Road, and the junctions of Xizang Road and Haining Road were still blocked by barbed wire, and the British troops had not yet withdrawn. Japanese troops were stationed in the weedy areas northwest of the bridge. The iron shops on the North Suzhou Road between Tianhougong Bridge and Shanxi Road Bridge were busy moving goods the day before yesterday, but there was no such activity yesterday. It is believed that they understood that the Japanese troops currently want to enter the eastern section of North Henan Road.

Not Discussed in the Board of Directors Meeting

The Municipal Council Board of Directors normally adjourns for the summer holidays and has now completed its term. At 4 p.m. yesterday, the first meeting was held. The general opinion was that at this meeting, the authorities would definitely report on and submit for discussion various major issues concerning the current situation of the Settlement, such as the extraterritorial road negotiations and the adjustment of the defense zones of the troops stationed by the various countries. According to the Dazhong News Agency, only two cases were listed on the agenda: (1) A joint letter from six foreign newspapers (including four English newspapers and one Russian and one Japanese newspaper each) to the Municipal Council objecting to the exclusive publication of public documents by the North-China Daily News; (2) A case of selling public land. Issues related to the Settlement were not raised for discussion. (According to the usual practice of the Municipal Council Board of Directors, cases not listed on the agenda are not discussed.)

Detectives and Puppet Police Confront Each Other

In the Caogjiadu area, the puppet police who occupied the positions of the settlement police the day before yesterday to direct traffic have still not withdrawn. However, three Chinese and Indian detectives have been added to each post to stand guard and confront the puppet police, but they are not directing traffic and have not clashed with the puppet police. Yesterday, armored vehicles, patrol cars, and Chinese, Western, and Indian detectives, and mounted patrol teams patrolled back and forth in various places, checking pedestrians non-stop all day.

Li Zhao Fang Almost Experienced a Conflict

Two puppet soldiers are still guarding the front of Si Ming Villa Zhong Shi Xin Cun on Yu Yuan Road. The number of puppet police stationed in Qianjia Lane, opposite Yuguang Village, has been reduced from six to two. Four puppet police have been stationed in front of the workers' dormitory of Feng Tian Textile Mill since the September 18th Incident and have not yet withdrawn. Six puppet police have also been stationed at the Bailinan Road intersection, and the number has now been reduced to two. At 10 a.m. yesterday, a Japanese truck carrying two Japanese military police and six puppet police drove to Li Zhao Fang at No. 909 and suddenly occupied the area, setting up defenses in front of the lane. At that moment, a police armored car carrying more than ten Chinese and Western detectives also arrived at the scene. Seeing the situation, all of them got out of the car with guns and forced the Japanese and puppet police to withdraw. The Japanese and puppet military police also drew their guns and confronted each other. The two sides faced off for a long time, and the situation was serious, almost leading to a conflict. The defense is currently still occupied and guarded by Japanese puppets. Police cars and detectives from the police patrol back and forth on Yu Yuan Road, and the tense situation remains unchanged.

Residents Feel Great Inconvenience Entering and Exiting

Four puppet police at the entrance of Yisheng Kang Ji Timber Yard, next to Qiuyuan at No. 15 Jiesifei'er Road, returned to their posts yesterday after withdrawing on the 11th. Four puppet police who were stationed in front of Sanyi Fang the day before yesterday have also been withdrawn. The number of puppet police in front of the gate of No. 1760 Jing'an Temple Road has increased to eight, and the security is stricter than before. Six armed puppet police suddenly went to the Wangjia Longkou entrance (next to Baigong Funeral Home) on Daxilu yesterday and were stationed there. Residents feel uneasy entering and exiting.

Border Inspection of the Settlement is Extremely Strict

The main gate of Lin's Mansion at No. 448 Haige Road has sandbags on each side. Recently, the Japanese puppets removed the sandbags in front of the side gate and piled them in front of the main gate. The project was completed yesterday. The side gate has been sealed since the sandbags were removed. The number of puppet police guarding the gate has also been increased by two, for a total of eight. The firearms are placed flat on the sandbags in a radial pattern. The surrounding situation is very tense. The police armored car and patrol team patrol the area from time to time, and the inspection of pedestrians and vehicles is extremely strict.

### Shipping Costs Between Shanghai and Europe and America Soar. Increase of 50 Percent to the Americas. Increase of 20 Percent to Europe and America. No Responsibility for Accidents En Route.

Since the outbreak of the European War, the shipping industry of the belligerent countries has been greatly affected. Some regular liners have been ordered to suspend sailings. Although non-scheduled ships are still operating, their schedules are kept secret. Although ships from neutral countries can still sail normally, they are operating at risk. Therefore, the shipping cost from Shanghai to the Americas has increased by 50 percent, and the cost from Shanghai to Europe has increased by 20 percent. Shipping companies are not responsible for accidents en route. Yesterday, the Dutch Java Mail Line also notified passengers that it would not be responsible for accidents involving goods loaded on its ships during the European War.

### North and South Ocean British Ship Sailing: Strict Secrecy of Voyage; Italian Speculation Still on Europe-Asia Route: Whether Key Points Can Be Reached Difficult to Predict

At the beginning of the European war, commercial vessels of various countries were temporarily suspended. Subsequently, armed vessels were ordered to resume sailing. Neutral vessels of other countries also continued to operate as usual on the North and South Pacific and North American routes. However, those heading to Europe rarely departed on schedule. In order to avoid damage from enemy submarines and to ensure the safety of travelers, all vessels of belligerent nations and those closely related to them have suspended voyages or shortened routes. A reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned from the China Travel Service yesterday that the Italian Postal Shipping Company's Conte Biancamano postal ship, originally scheduled to depart for Europe on the 14th of this month, was delayed in Shanghai due to some reason. Now, due to excessive cargo accumulation, the ship has been rescheduled to depart from Shanghai Customs for Europe on the 24th of this month. Passenger ticket procedures have already begun. Whether it will be able to reach its final destination on the European route is still difficult to predict. It is heard that many people have contacted to board the ship to the South Seas recently, but very few are going to Europe. The ship arrived in Shanghai on the 12th and, after unloading passengers and cargo, sailed to Wusong to anchor. It is scheduled to return to the Jardine Matheson Wharf at 7:00 am this morning to load export goods.

Jardine Matheson and Taikoo Shipping Diminished

British commercial vessels sailing along the coastal ports of China were once ordered to cease operations, but soon resumed sailing. However, ship imports are kept strictly secret, and exports are also difficult to accurately determine. As for the North China route, Jardine Matheson's ships continue to operate as usual, but Taikoo's liner services have been greatly reduced. The reason for this is that the company does not have formal warehouses, so local miscellaneous grains are not loaded onto Taikoo's ships. The company's cargo transportation on the South China route is slightly better than on the North China route, but it is also slightly affected because freight charges are settled in Hong Kong dollars.

Irregular Ships Fully Loaded with Passengers and Cargo

As for irregular vessels, they are still calculated in national currency, resulting in a threefold profit. Recently, Qia Cheng Company has managed the Norwegian commercial vessel "Guardian Beck," weighing 3,000 tons, which is scheduled to sail directly to Hong Kong on the 24th, arriving in three days. Cargo delivery is convenient for the local people. Furthermore, the "Yong Zhen" vessel, jointly managed by Tong Shun and Zhong Wei Companies, has also been approved to sail to Hong Kong on the 24th, and also to Haiphong. It is reported that both ships are fully loaded with passengers and cargo.

After Consideration, German Ships Sail to Zhenhai

Since the outbreak of the European war, the German North German Lloyd and Hamburg America Line shipping companies have suspended all vessels operating on Far East routes. However, German ships operating along the coastal ports of China have been ordered to stop sailing beyond three kilometers from Chinese territorial waters. Now, German ships operating in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River continue to operate as usual because they are within Chinese territorial waters. However, regarding the sailing of ships to Zhenhai, after consideration by various companies, "Falcon" sailed to Zhenhai yesterday, and "Hana" is scheduled to sail to Zhenhai today.

Xiangtai Arrives in Shanghai; Shenyou Anchors in Wenzhou

After the Japanese navy declared that it would blockade Wenzhou Bay from the evening of the 17th, the British Yi Long Company's "Shenyou" vessel still sailed to Wenzhou on the 18th. Yesterday, a telegram was received from the shipowner stating that it had safely arrived at the mouth of the Ou River. The telegram did not mention when it would enter the port. The British "New Xiangtai" vessel, represented by Taichangxiang Company, left Wenzhou for Shanghai on the morning of the 18th and safely arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying charcoal, local paper, and passengers. However, it has not yet been decided whether it will sail to Wenzhou again in the future, as navigation is quite dangerous after Japanese warships laid mines outside the mouth of Wenzhou. The British "Yongtai" vessel, which originally planned to sail to Wenzhou, has also changed its route to Zhenhai.

### Shanghai Post Office: Strictly Prohibiting Letter Carriers from Demanding Tips

Shanghai Post Office News: The Post Office strictly prohibits letter carriers from demanding alcohol money or holiday rewards. If such incidents occur, people can firmly refuse them and immediately report the situation and the uniform number of the letter carrier to the Post Office for disciplinary action.

### American Transportation Company Takes on Huge Responsibility: Reorganizing Highway System; Engaging in Adjusting Southwest Highway Transportation; Funding from US-China Loan; "Jixing" Has Already Reached Agreement with the Chinese Side

Mainland News reports that, according to the Chicago Daily Tribune, an American truck driver who struggled from nothing and became wealthy in the American transportation industry will personally take responsibility for reorganizing China's highway system. The driver's name is Jixing, who is the chairman of the Chicago Jixing Transcontinental Trucking Company.

Negotiation Process: Mr. Chen, the director of the Chinese government's trade agency in the United States, reached an agreement with Jixing Company in August. The funding for this project will be allocated from the $25 million loan extended to China by the Export-Import Bank of the United States last December. Jixing, who is responsible for reorganizing transportation on the Burma Road and the Haiphong-Chongqing Road, first sent Xue Heng and two other members of the company to China at the end of August. It is said that Jixing Company's services were introduced by the U.S. government, but Mr. Chen has denied this, saying that he engaged Jixing due to business relations.

Main Tasks: Jixing's main task is to accelerate transportation on the two highways from Burma and Vietnam to Chongqing. Another part of the work is to coordinate transportation between the highways and the railways still under the control of the central government. A serious problem that Jixing and others will encounter is how to utilize the empty trucks returning from Chongqing to coastal locations to transport tung oil and other export products. It is said that the current transportation system is time-consuming and costly.

Ordering Trucks: China recently purchased 3,000 trucks from the United States, and another 2,000 are under negotiation. Most of the trucks that have already been shipped have arrived in Haiphong and Yangon. The companies that supplied these trucks include Chrysler, General Motors, and others. Mr. Rein, the vice chairman of Global Trading Company, which purchased the trucks for China, stated that these trucks will be used to transport all kinds of goods in and out of China. Most of the commerce is routed through the highway to Yangon. Although there has been heavy rain recently, the road conditions are good. The highway to Haiphong is also not affected by the rain.

### US Mine-Laying Ship Comes to Shanghai from Qingdao

The English-language North China Daily News reports that the U.S. Asian Fleet's mine-laying ship "Finch," which usually berths in Qingdao during the summer, has set anchor and is coming to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive around noon tomorrow (the 21st). The duration of the ship's stay in Shanghai is unknown, but it is expected to be short, and it will soon sail to the Philippines.

### Britain and France Have No Time to Attend to the East; Japan Carries Out New Conspiracy: Eager to End the War with China; Obtain Britain's and France's Interests in the Far East; However, Anxious About the United States

The English-language North China Daily News reports that, according to unofficial Japanese sources in this city, influential political circles in Japan believe that the militaristic officers of the Japanese Navy are currently actively engaged in forming a five-nation alliance between the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, and China. Proponents of this new diplomatic policy in Japan claim that this alliance would be most beneficial to Japan.

Attempting to End the War and Trying to Advance Southward

Because it can simultaneously solve Japan's two major problems: (1) To gradually cease hostilities with China, ending a war that has lasted far longer than Japan initially expected; (2) Japan would be in a position to prevent the United States from assisting Britain and France and participating in the European war, and could begin naval operations, resulting in Japan being able to occupy Hong Kong, French Vietnam, and even the rich Dutch East Indies. In other words, with Britain and France preoccupied in Europe, Japan will be able to seize Britain's and France's interests in the Far East.

Will Make Further Concessions on Conditions to China

It is said that Japanese political circles who support this new action are even prepared to cease hostilities with China on conditions that are much more moderate than previously demanded. They believe that once Japan seizes Britain's and France's interests in the Far East, its position will be such that it can demand even harsher conditions from China later. Japanese political circles also claim that even if China refuses to join the alliance and prefers to continue the war of resistance, the Japanese government will still be able to proceed with its new policy, although it will be hampered by having to station a large army on the Chinese front.

Rumors for Days Must Have a Reason

According to Japanese sources in this city, the agreement reached in Moscow on a Soviet-Japanese truce, ending hostilities in the "Manchukuo-Mongolia" border area, is only a preliminary step towards this goal. Now that there is a possibility of concluding a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Japan, Japan is now engaging in efforts to make peace with China, so that the realization of the five-nation alliance plan is closer. The rumor that former Prime Minister Konoe announced five peace conditions while in office is now in contact with Chinese government leaders in Hong Kong, and the rumor that Song Ziwen, one of the Chinese government leaders supported by the Chinese Communist Party, has flown to Moscow. Although Chongqing has denied it, observers believe that there must be some reason for the spread of these rumors, which are related to these developments.

Acknowledging the National Government's Request for a Truce

Wang Jingwei recently sent another telegram to Generalissimo Chiang and other leaders of the Chinese government, calling for peace. A prominent feature of his telegram is that he no longer criticizes the Communist Party in Chongqing, whom Wang used to accuse of "protecting and coercing" Generalissimo Chiang. At the same time, Japan's "New Declaration" republished an editorial advocating peace between China and Japan. Some sources claim that Japan, or at least a portion of the influential leaders in Japanese politics, the military, and the navy, are eager to stop the war in China in order to embark on new ventures that are more profitable. Japan will re-recognize the Chongqing government in exchange for a truce and alliance, but will insist on Wang Jingwei's reinstatement.

Chongqing Has Not Yet Made a Definite Statement

Japan will also agree to withdraw Japanese troops from China, except for stationing several divisions in major cities, and to at least temporarily accept the "economic cooperation" advocated by the Chongqing leaders, rather than the economic domination previously sought by Japan. However, the exact terms of peace have not yet been formulated. Chongqing's response to the rumored Japanese proposal is still unknown. However, it is certain that any contact between Tokyo and Chongqing is still in its early stages. It is heard that a portion of Japanese leaders oppose this radical new policy, fearing that it will lead to a direct conflict with the U.S. government, and the U.S. fleet is still stationed in the Pacific.

### Cost of Living Continues to Increase; Public Works Department Continues to Add Subsidies: From 25% to 40%; Approved by the Board of Directors; Effective from October; - Annual Cost Approximately 750,000 Yuan -

In June of this year, the Public Works Department's Board of Directors approved an increase in temporary cost-of-living subsidies for employees, and resolved that this subsidy would be re-reviewed by the end of September, depending on the situation. Due to the further contraction of foreign exchange and the increase in the cost of living,

The Department's Selection Committee met on the 11th of this month and resolved to request the Board of Directors to approve an increase in the amount of subsidies for all employees holding contracts from October 1st of this year, from 25% to 40%. This subsidy is for "B" and "L" grade employees,

Paid according to the full amount of their salaries; "A" grade employees, paid according to two-thirds of their salaries; Chinese employees who do not hold contracts, their subsidies increased from 20% (minimum of 4 yuan) to 30% (minimum of 6 yuan). The committee also resolved that "A" grade employees should receive

Exchange subsidies for one-third of their salaries. In view of the Department's financial situation, it is proposed that the original standard be maintained, that is, one Zhou coin is equivalent to six pence in English currency, and not based on the current exchange rate. If the exchange rate limit is changed to four pence, the annual subsidy calculated at this exchange rate will require

753,000 yuan. According to the method proposed by the Selection Committee above, the total amount of subsidies for all employees is as follows: "A grade employees" 186,000 yuan, "B" and "L" grade employees 753,000 yuan, Chinese employees who do not hold contracts 478,000 yuan, totaling 1,417,000 yuan. The above recommendations have been approved by the Public Works Department's Board of Directors at its regular meeting on the 20th of this month.

### Recall of Tram Ticket Vouchers; Extended; 3-Cent Voucher Extended for Use for One Month

Shanghai Tramway Company's voucher, the amount of which is three cents, has been printed in three types, June, July, and August 1939. The company originally stipulated that the above voucher could be used until yesterday in order to prevent forgery. It could not be used from today onwards. Because this voucher has been used as a substitute for money in the market for a long time, it has been rejected by everyone since the company issued the previous announcement. However, according to the Datong News Agency reporter who inquired this morning, the tram company has extended the 3-cent voucher for one month, allowing it to be used until October 20th. Therefore, the voucher will definitely continue to circulate in the market, slightly alleviating the need for the extended issuance of small coins.

Tobacco and Money Exchange Industries: The money exchange and tobacco industries associations in this city, due to a lack of subsidiary currency and difficulties in making change, have issued various vouchers to meet the current urgent needs. Recently, it was discovered that counterfeit vouchers were being mixed in everywhere, which was very harmful to the common people. Furthermore, since the Central Bank will be issuing new coins soon, the difficulty in making change can be expected to be resolved.

Exchange and Recall: Therefore, they have separately implemented the exchange and recall of the originally issued vouchers in full, and have unanimously stopped issuing new vouchers. Furthermore, according to rumors in the two industries, the Central Bank has shipped 200,000 yuan of new subsidiary currency coins from Hong Kong, which remains to be verified.

### No. 17 Pu Shi Village Searched Yesterday

One Wireless Machine Found; And a Mr. Xu Arrested

At 2:00 AM yesterday, French police dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to search the house at No. 17 Pu Shi Village, Pu Shi Road. A wireless telegraph machine was found on the spot, said to be worth more than a thousand dollars, and five young women in the house were arrested. Subsequently, a Mr. Xu was arrested at Siming Village, Fuxu Road, and taken back to the police station for investigation. It is said that Mr. Xu is a supervisor assigned by the Central Ministry of Finance to the Shanghai Gold Exchange. As for the wireless telegraph machine, the police reported that it was confiscated because it had not been registered in advance. The five women who were arrested were released after questioning.

### US Naval Commander Hurlbut Will Come to Shanghai Again: Scheduled to Come to Shanghai at the End of the Month to Contact Various Parties; Trip to Qingdao Due to Official Business

Admiral Hurlbut, Commander of the U.S. Asian Fleet, hurriedly came to Shanghai from Qingdao last Thursday because the Japanese convened a meeting of defense forces from various countries in Shanghai. He then visited U.S. Consul Gauss to discuss the defense force meeting. Although the specifics of the discussion have not been disclosed, many believe that the U.S. interests in Shanghai need Admiral Hurlbut's opinions. It is now known that Admiral Hurlbut has unfinished business in North China related to his Shanghai trip, so he left Shanghai on the private yacht "Isabelle" at 3:00 PM on the 19th and sailed to Qingdao. Before leaving, Admiral Hurlbut revealed that his mission in Shanghai was not completed and that he would stay in Qingdao for a week and then take the flagship "Augusta" back to Shanghai at the end of September. At that time, Admiral Hurlbut hopes to stay in Shanghai for a longer period to observe the development of the situation in Shanghai and maintain contact with various parties.

### First Cheap Rice Distribution Point Cancelled; Pingyao Ends This Week; Points One and Two Merged and Open as Usual; A Coolie Died of Heatstroke at Point Four

Yesterday was the fourth day of the first cheap rice distribution. The entrances to the five distribution points were still crowded with people, but the order was good. Each district from one to four sold 200 bags, while district five sold 250 bags. Rice prices continued to fall due to the cheap rice distribution. The details are as follows:

Change of Location: Point One opened at 7:00 AM and finished selling at 12:00 PM. However, because the location was close to Zhabei and there were concerns about accidents, it was announced that it would be merged with Point Two starting today. The original announcement is as follows: "Because the location of the first cheap rice distribution point is close to Zhabei and there is nothing to block the surroundings, and the number of rice buyers is too large and crowded, it is easy for accidents to occur. Therefore, it has been decided to merge the first cheap rice distribution point with the second cheap rice distribution point at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Carter Road, starting tomorrow (the 21st), and to continue the cheap rice distribution as usual. This is hereby announced."

Generous Contribution: The order at Point Two was good throughout the day. After stopping sales at 3:00 PM, thousands of civilians were still standing and waiting, reluctant to leave. The director of the district, at the suggestion of a Western police officer, issued each person a piece of paper (stamped with the seal of the Rice Industry Association's Second Cheap Rice Distribution Point) so that they could buy tickets first tomorrow. Point Three opened at 8:00 AM and finished selling at 1:00 PM. In order to prevent overcrowding, Chinese and Western police officers used long ropes to block off the area north of Rue du Consulat and Gordon Road, and rice buyers entered in an orderly fashion. The order was good. Seeing the crowded situation, the distribution may be increased by 100 bags tomorrow. At 9:00 AM yesterday, two young women went to the site to observe and were moved by the plight of the civilians scrambling to buy rice. They volunteered to donate 35 yuan to help with the purchase of tickets. A staff member at the site also donated 67 two-sheng rice tickets, worth 26.8 yuan. Their courage and willingness to help is commendable.

Death from Heatstroke: Point Four finished selling at 2:30 PM. The police officers still used long ropes to block off both ends of West Gate Road (Avenue des Soeurs and Rue Luber) for rice buyers to enter and exit, so the order was also good. Point Five opened at 8:00 AM and finished selling at 6:00 PM. However, the weather was hot yesterday afternoon, and the civilians were crowded. At 3:20 PM, a middle-aged man suddenly collapsed from heatstroke in front of the Danjing Temple. A reporter from the Datong News Agency was inspecting the site and saw an ambulance arrive and take the man to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The reporter followed to the hospital and carried him to the emergency room, but he had already died. He was wearing dark blue shorts, barefoot, bald, wearing black cloth shoes, his chest open, and his face dark. A flour bag for buying rice was left beside him, but no banknotes were found. At 3:50 PM, the reporter left the hospital and saw that the French police had sent officers to the scene and then sent the body to the morgue. The man's name is unknown.

Rice Prices Continue to Fall: Yesterday, the owners registered 3,884 bags of rice for sale at the Rice Market Management Committee. Because the arrival of goods was very large, prices continued to fall. Transactions were mostly for indica rice, because middle-class families are using indica rice instead of japonica rice. According to people at the market, the arrival of goods from various places is increasing, and rice prices are expected to continue to weaken.

Ends This Week: According to information obtained by a reporter from the Daguang News Agency, yesterday was the fourth day of the cheap rice distribution. The large ones have already sold 4,000 bags, calculated at an average of 1,000 bags sold each day. There are still 4,000 bags remaining, which will be sold out this week. The distribution will be announced to end by Saturday of this week. Therefore, each district will issue an additional 100 bags starting today to sell as much as possible. As for whether to continue with a second cheap rice distribution, the various groups have not yet considered it and will need to discuss it before making a decision.

### City Federation Studies How to Raise Funds for Education at the Theatre

### Australian Tycoon Broadcasts Tonight: Describes Transformation from Personal Reform to Social Reform

Mr. Robb Coldhbeck, an Englishman, grew up in Australia. He was good at doing business and accumulated a lot of wealth, so he lived a romantic life and indulged in drinking and lust. His wife finally couldn't bear it anymore and was about to file for divorce. At this point, Mr. Robb also regretted it very much, but he couldn't change his bad habits and couldn't get out of it. One day, he accidentally turned on the radio for entertainment and heard a famous artist describe his transformation process. His absurd situation was exactly the same. Later, he found a "solution," which was to hand himself over to God's management. He immediately gained the ability to correct his mistakes and help others reform. Mr. Robb was greatly moved and humbly appealed to God, willing to be managed. From then on, he completely cleared away the bad habits he had been fighting for more than 20 years. His wife and children also began a new life together. Later, he spoke in the Australian Parliament, and leaders from political and business circles were reformed, affecting the entire Australia. Mr. Robb recently went to the United States to attend the World Conference on Moral Rearmament. The day before yesterday, he came to Shanghai with the Chinese delegation and is currently staying at Room 613 of the International Hotel. Those who wish to meet him are welcome and he will be happy to entertain them. He is scheduled to broadcast his experience at 8:30 tonight (Thursday) on 760 kHz and contribute it to Shanghai.

### Bizarre Kidnapping Case on Tianjin Road; Fortunately Rescued by Rickshaw Pullers; Two Japanese Tied Up a Mr. Wang; Dozens of Rickshaw Pullers Rescued Him

The Zi Lin Daily reports that the police department was investigating two Japanese and a Chinese man last night because the three men tied up another Chinese man in front of No. 405 Tianjin Road yesterday afternoon. A Mr. Wang, the owner of a coal shop on Liaozhou Road, took a rickshaw to the Coal Merchants Association office at No. 405 Tianjin Road yesterday afternoon. As soon as he stepped out of the rickshaw, two Japanese and a Chinese man stood in front of him and asked Mr. Wang his name and occupation. At that time, there was a taxi waiting next to the three men. Mr. Wang immediately explained that he was going to the

Coal Merchants Association in the building, but the three men insisted that Wang's last name was another one, and that entering the building was not to go to the Coal Merchants Association, but to engage in other activities. Mr. Wang repeatedly stated that he was indeed a coal merchant. As a result of the argument, the two Japanese and the Chinese man grabbed Mr. Wang and tried to drag him into the taxi. Mr. Wang resisted, but seemed no match for the three men. At that moment, an unexpected thing happened. Twenty or thirty rickshaw pullers, who were paying attention to their dispute from a distance, rushed forward and grabbed Mr. Wang. Both sides

As a result of the struggle, Mr. Wang was finally left on the sidewalk. The rickshaw pullers surrounded him, while the two Japanese hurriedly got into the taxi, which was driven away by the Chinese man who was with them. According to the judgment obtained by the detectives investigating this matter last night, the two Japanese mistakenly identified the coal merchant as another Chinese man, but the two were extremely similar. The investigation is underway and is expected to uncover an interesting conspiracy.

### Pig Slaughtering Dispute

The pig slaughtering workers at the French Concession slaughterhouse and the butchers have been disputing over increasing the slaughtering fee, restoring the method of dividing the seven offal parts (i.e., cutting off the small intestine, tail tip, heart lining fat, etc.), and the issue of not being responsible for sick, paralyzed, or dead pigs. Both sides threatened to suspend operations. The director of the Public Works Department convened an arbitration and ruled that the slaughtering fee be increased to 1.5 yuan. An agreement was reached on the 18th of this month. However, because it was not followed on time, the offal parts were cut off uniformly that night. The situation has become quite serious, and meat eaters will be panicked.

### Housing Dispute in Qingyu Lane: Eviction Deadline Yesterday; Tenants Still Find Eviction Difficult; Request to Add Rent for Continued Residence

The tenants in Qingyu Lane on New Chongqing Road in this city have been in a lawsuit with the Shanghai Women's Bank, which leased the lane and plans to renovate the houses, for many years. The Women's Bank won the case after three trials on March 31st of this year, and the tenants were ordered to move out before April 15th of this year. Later, because the tenants had difficulty finding houses, they did not move out, which led to tragedies such as fights and water cuts in May. On July 9th, after mediation by all parties, both sides agreed to extend the deadline to September 20th. Yesterday was the deadline for eviction, but the tenants still showed no signs of moving out. According to the tenants, we are willing to increase the rent appropriately, but eviction is really difficult. It is heard that several families who originally planned to move to the cross-border area have now temporarily given up. On the part of the Women's Bank, it has repeatedly extended the eviction deadline and has also expressed understanding for the tenants.

### Lewd Monk Appeals Ten Thousand Yuan Case, Suddenly Withdraws Before Judgment; Civil Lawsuit Opens Yesterday for Discussion of Postponement and Further Verification; Sun Lanzhen Sentenced to Three Months' Imprisonment, Suspended for Two Years

Previously, during the warlord era, Yang Sunshi, the beloved concubine of Yang Yunwu, a native of Gaoyou who successively served as county magistrate in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong provinces, namely Sun Lanzhen, was seduced and raped by Wan Yuan (lay name Tong Changyao), the former abbot monk of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple. She was instigated to abscond with a huge sum of gold jewelry on May 28 of this year. After Yang discovered this, he reported the matter to the police, who first arrested Wan Yuan, confiscated the stolen goods pillowcase, and sent them to the Special No. 2 Court, where he was prosecuted for receiving stolen goods. The result was a sentence of

Six months' imprisonment, with Yang Yunwu's attached civil lawsuit for 6,690 yuan and 550 yuan in losses, transferred to the Civil Court for trial. Subsequently, the police arrested Sun Lanzhen and sent her to the Special No. 2 Court, where she was prosecuted for theft. According to her confession, she completely believed Wan Yuan's instigation to abscond, and all the huge sums of money and three pairs of gold bracelets she took away were handed over to Wan Yuan, with herself only using 200 yuan. She was ordered to post bail and reschedule the trial. Wan Yuan, dissatisfied with the initial trial judgment, commissioned lawyer Xu Wufangjin as his agent to the High Third Branch Court

He filed an appeal. The joint collegiate panel of the High Third Branch Court summoned Sun Lanzhen for questioning some days ago. After the trial concluded, the verdict was scheduled to be announced yesterday afternoon. Regarding Sun Lanzhen, namely Yang Sunshi's theft case, was tried yesterday morning by Judge Qiu of the Special No. 2 Court. The court ruled that she be sentenced to three months' imprisonment, suspended for two years. As for the attached civil lawsuit filed by Yang Yunwu against Wan Yuan, it was transferred from the Criminal Court to the Civil Court for handling. Yesterday morning, Judge Yu Changzi opened the Civil

Seventh Court to hear the case. The plaintiff Yang Yunwu, accompanied by representative lawyer Liu Xiang, appeared in court and recounted the previous events. The defendant Wan Yuan was brought to court from the detention center and vehemently denied instigating Sunshi to abscond, evasively shifting blame. The court, due to the criminal appeal verdict not yet being final, decided to postpone the hearing. The defendant was returned to custody. Wan Yuan, knowing that the whole truth had been revealed by Sunshi's confession and that the appeal was unreasonable, immediately submitted a statement to the High Third Branch Court after the conclusion of the debate, requesting

To withdraw the appeal. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Court President Wu Tingqi of the High Third Branch Court, accompanied by Judges Chen and Wang, opened the court and brought Wan Yuan to the court. He asked, "Do you request to withdraw the appeal?" The answer was yes. The court ordered, "Since the appeal was withdrawn before the judgment, it is hereby approved. He is to be returned to custody to await execution."

### Two Thieves Sentenced

Cai Jingji and Chai Yanqing, who dealt in woolen yarn, each carrying 3,000 yuan in legal tender, intended to go to Jardine Matheson & Co. on the Bund to purchase woolen yarn at 1:45 PM on the 29th of last month. As they passed Sichuan Road, several robbers suddenly stepped forward to rob them. Cai and others resisted, and one of the robbers immediately drew a pistol and fired at Cai, hitting Cai in the shoulder. At that time, nearby detectives heard the alarm and surrounded the area to arrest the perpetrators. Two thieves, Wang Arong from Hangzhou and Shen Guilin from Pudong, were arrested, and a pistol and three bullets were confiscated. They were taken to the General Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Chief Fan Defu and Detective Zhu Zixiang, the facts were confirmed. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a public prosecution with the Special No. 1 Court on charges of attempted murder and robbery. The trial has been concluded, and yesterday morning, Criminal Court President Qian Hongye announced the judgment: Wang Arong was sentenced to nine years and six months' imprisonment, and Shen Guilin was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. The confiscated pistol and bullets were all confiscated.

### Lawyer Yang Yiming Assaults Someone; Store Association Provides Proof; Witnesses See Yang Beating Old Woman

Young lawyer Yang Yiming, residing at No. 33 Qiyicun, Xujiahui West Street, was reported to the police for allegedly assaulting Song Wangshi (50 years old), a woman from Songjiang, and a request was made for punishment. The Special No. 1 Court had already held a trial once, and the police requested a postponement for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu held another trial. The victim, Song Wangshi, firmly stated that on the afternoon of the 7th of this month, she went to the defendant's house to look for her daughter-in-law, Song Zhang Hongshi, and saw the defendant and her daughter-in-law lying in bed chatting. She broke into the bedroom and scolded her daughter-in-law, and was dragged out of the door and beaten by the defendant. The court questioned the defendant, Yang Yipeng, based on this, but he vehemently denied it. Judge Qiu then presented the joint public statement from more than 30 shops and residents of Qiyicun, witnessing Yang's assault, to Yang for his inspection. Yang Yiming then stated to the court that since the shops and residents had witnessed the assault, he requested the court to summon them to court for cross-examination. Judge Qiu reviewed the case and decided to postpone the trial for further deliberation.

### Pushing Daughter into River, Drowning Her

Shen Jinfa, a native of Peidong, 33 years old this year, owned a barge. His deceased former wife had a daughter named Shen Qiuqin, 11 years old this year. Shen also entered into a matrilocal marriage with Shen Li (52 years old this year), a fellow villager and colleague. He, his former wife's daughter, and his current wife, his mother-in-law, lived together on the boat. On the 19th of this month, the boat was anchored in the old port of Suzhou Creek. At 10:00 PM that night, Shen Jinfa pushed his daughter Qiuqin into the water due to an argument with his step-mother-in-law Shen Li. The tide was strong at the time, making rescue impossible, resulting in the daughter drowning. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the girl's body floated up in the Wusong Wharf of Suzhou Creek. Shen Li reported this to the Jianghai Customs Yong Police Station, and Shen Jinfa was arrested and transferred to the French Police Station for investigation. Meanwhile, the body was retrieved and sent to the Tongren Funeral Home for preservation, pending a report to the Special No. 2 Court to send personnel for inspection.

### Shanghai Performing Arts Association

The Shanghai Performing Arts Association was organized for the purpose of mutual assistance among enthusiastic members of the performing arts community and to promote art. Yu Qiaqing was hired as honorary president, Lin Kanghou and Yuan Ludeng as honorary vice presidents, and Kai Bangjun as honorary chairman of the board. Zhang Zhier, Liu Ziyun, Huang Zhaolin, Li Zhuan, Dong Tianmin and fifteen others were designated as directors. Recognizing the suffering of colleagues due to birth, aging, illness, and death, with no one to care for them, and the hardship of colleagues’ children without access to school, a relief group was specially established to secure colleagues’ welfare and operational security. For example, the 040 Stomach Pain Medicine Tablet Factory suddenly stopped broadcasting programmes due to raw material shortages, violating the contract, resulting in material and powder issues. The association has been entrusted by the various performing artists to mediate this matter. However, as the association is newly established, funds are limited. Therefore, in accordance with the association's charter, major factories and companies are being sought to serve as sponsoring members, paying an annual sponsorship fee of 120 yuan. In return, the association has established mandatory publicity methods to repay them. It is reported that dozens of companies, including Chinese and Western pharmacies and Xinhua Film Company, have already joined, which is quite enthusiastic.

### Zhabei Shenchang Foreign Firm Warehouse; Bold Thieves Carry Away Iron Moulds; Detectives Guard Dock and Search; Stolen Ship Discovers Dock and Flees

At around 2:00 AM on the 17th of this month, a large gang of thieves, numbering more than thirty, suddenly arrived at the Zhabei Shenchang Foreign Firm warehouse. Among them, two thieves each held a new-style box cannon, and one thief held a rifle. They broke down the door and used violent means to scare and silence the four Russian inspectors hired in the warehouse, tying them with ropes.

The remaining thieves began robbing under surveillance. However, there were no goods in the warehouse, only heavy ironware. The group seemed to have a pre-determined plan, having hired a boat to wait in advance. They managed to transport the iron moulds, worth more than 20,000 yuan, to the boat, and then they howled as they boarded the boat and sailed away. The incident was learned by Chinese detective Yao Changmin and detective Xia Yexian of the Jing'an Temple Police Station.

Other accomplices were waiting at the Xiaoshadu Road dock for the goods to be transported to the dock, where they would help unload them and then find a way to sell them. The detectives and Chinese and Western detectives rushed to the Xiaoshadu Road dock to lie in wait. Before long, they saw the stolen boat coming. Unexpectedly, the thieves on the boat had also discovered the detectives lying in ambush on the shore, so with a shout, they turned the boat around and fled downstream. At the same time, they threw the iron moulds on the boat into the river. By the time the detectives notified the authorities in the northern district

And coordinated the pursuit, the stolen boat had disappeared. Only five suspects from Jiangbei, Xun Jishan, Song Ada, Li Tongyu, Li Tongfen, and Shen Zhigao, were arrested on the dock and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Second Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang recounted the facts of the case and requested that the suspects be detained for investigation. The judge ordered approval and ordered detention for seven days for further verification.

At that time, the two Indian police officers were unable to resist due to their weapons being robbed. The robbers fled in different directions from the darkness. The two Indian police officers immediately returned to the police station in charge to report the incident.

### Casual Understanding of Reading (1)

— Qin Lao

In the fourth year of Zhonghe in the Tang Dynasty, Huang Chao was annihilated. When Huang Chao's head was presented to the emperor, a group of noble women who had surrendered to the "bandits" were also brought in. The emperor asked, "You have all received the grace of the royal family. Why did you surrender to the bandits?" The leading female prisoner replied, "The country has a million people and still loses ground and moves the capital. Your Majesty blames a few women for not resisting. Aren't the civil and military officials ashamed?" As a result, the emperor asked no more questions and simply shouted, "Drag them down and behead them!"

This story was able to circulate, thanks to Sima Guang: he wrote it in the "Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government." Zhou Hui, in the "Qingbo Magazine," specially praised this woman who had given the emperor a setback, saying that it was a shame that such a person was not written into the "Biographies of Virtuous Women," causing her name to be forgotten. - This insight, in my opinion, is "unique" among the ancient Chinese.

But the emperor mentioned here is Emperor Xizong of Tang. In the "Unofficial History of the Nanzhao" I read about another matter involving this emperor and a woman.

In the same year that Huang Chao was "painfully annihilated" by Li Keyong (the third year of Zhonghe), because Nanzhao (i.e., Yunnan) was strong and tough, the emperor felt that it was somewhat difficult to deal with, so he sent a princess of the imperial family to the king of Nanzhao, Longshun. This calculation was not wrong. Nanzhao really sent the most important ministers to negotiate with the Tang Dynasty. So three came, and he poisoned three of them. It's just a pity that Li Keyong rebelled again not long after, and this grand plan was never able to develop. I think that princess probably repaid the "grace of the royal family."

Chinese writers have always been unwilling to talk about other people's shortcomings, saying it is "preserving the way of loyalty and generosity." But this "loyalty and generosity" often turns into hypocrisy.

Wu Dexuan's "The First Moon Tower Records" is a book recording figures since the Ming and Qing dynasties, which is a great contribution to historical anecdotes. However, reading it from beginning to end raises a question. That question is: how can the people he "heard" and "saw" all be so talented and moral? Because in fact, it is really not seen that there are "good people" everywhere. Therefore, in my opinion, Wu Dexuan's work is at least partially untrue.

And to conceal something for a person, one must use one's own moral standards as the standard, which often precisely conceals a person's strengths. For example, the entry on Xu Juyuan in "The First Moon Tower Records" makes such a mistake.

According to the record there, Xu Juyuan was simply capable of writing articles, lived in seclusion in the mountains, vowed not to surrender to the Qing, and was burned to death by robbers, and that was all. But Xu Juyuan had another moving story: he once participated in the rebellious peasant army, and at that time he himself was called a "robber." In my opinion, since he was able to vow not to surrender to the Qing, his being a "robber" must have had something to do with "anti-Qing." Now we know very little about his deeds. Given Wu Dexuan's era and "hearing," he should have known, but he made his deeds disappear in order to conceal them.

### Morning Glory House (Note)

— Tang Wei

—Memories of Rubble—

Under the Rainbow Bridge, after a stretch of dimly lit streets.

Not very respectable doors, with a few not very respectable enamel signs nailed to them; from the outside, this looks neither like an institution nor like a private residence.

"It's here!"

The old buddy who came with me, pushes open the door, and the swirling lights leak out, adding a touch of mysterious temptation to the hearts of the guests.

In a luxurious - but not spacious - living room, several guests of different styles are already seated.

"When did you come back?"

Qun is my only acquaintance, he comes up to grab my right hand.

"This morning."

The unfamiliar friends stare at us like wooden chickens.

After a while.

"Is it Old Tang?" the host asks the old buddy modestly:

He is a complete gentleman in the Harbin style, with a long-collared pointed shirt and a wide-headed tie; a pair of goldfish eyes flutter with watery light in the diamond-shaped glasses.

"Ah, let me introduce everyone! Old Tang, ... our boss and Morning Glory House owner, Rong Qiu; great poet Qiaofu, Old Wang, theorist Shiyu, silly brother Old Meng, Rong Qiu's wife, Qun doesn't need me to introduce him;" the old buddy points his thumb on his chest and says, "Old hen artist Old Chong is being introduced!"

Everyone who was introduced smiles apologetically and mischievously.

A few minutes later, everyone becomes intimate with each other, talking endlessly and randomly.

The old buddy clings to a female teacher who comes later, he keeps calling her "Dry Sister," which sounds very uncomfortable.

Rong Qiu is always smiling insincerely, but not without gentlemanly demeanor. - He kindly entertained me that evening.

The friends I met here, each gave me a deep impression; I don't like them fooling around in serious environments; but I cherish their enthusiasm in a cold atmosphere.

Saying goodbye.

Seeing that the walls all around are newly dead rice seedlings, I firmly believe that this is the reason for the name "Morning Glory House."

Note: The Morning Glory House was a literary group with a relatively good reputation in the Northeast around the "September 18th" Incident. It disappeared five years ago. Few of the friends who used to gather together are still alive today, except for a few who have gone south; its name was mentioned once in "Shangshi Street," this is the second time.

### After Reading "The Pulse of Italy"

— Bella Tu

After reading "The Pulse of Italy" (originally "Fontamara") by the Italian anti-fascist writer Silone, my heart is pounding; this is not because I am afraid of seeing the cruelty of the fascist rule, I am one million percent angry for those Italian poor peasants who were persecuted by the fascists. My heart is leaping wildly, enraged by Silone's work!

We read the literary works of various countries, but now we cannot read those of Italy and Germany, there is no room for culture there! The so-called "colonial literature," "military literature," and some "ode literature" that praises "Party Masters" are just fascist ornaments! The real value of literature cannot be found in those "works"!

Therefore, today, when we read Mr. Silone's "The Pulse of Italy," we cannot but say that it is an unexpected sweet fruit, but this sweet fruit does not bring a fresh and sweet taste, but a bitter and sour taste, which is truly woven from the blood, tears, and healthy voices of the Italian people!

What exactly is fascism? We may have found answers in some theoretical books, but in living artistic images, we have not been as concretely told as in Mr. Silone's "The Pulse of Italy." In this book, it tells us that the fascists try every possible means to exploit the poor peasants of Fontamara Village. Once the poor peasants cannot make a living, a large number of Blackshirt troops are sent to beat them into a chaotic mess - my way of talking can only be said abstractly like this. You want to ask why the Blackshirt troops are only sent at this time to beat the poor peasants into a chaotic mess? Because first: these poor peasants can no longer "squeeze out blood" (Shanghai gangster slang, meaning they don't have a penny.); second, since they can no longer "squeeze out blood," and those people always have to "live," but unfortunately they can't even suck a little of their own "blood" to "live." In order to strictly prevent them from making trouble, it is best to kill them!

That's what fascism is.

The form of this book is novel, narrated by three poor peasants, but Mr. Silone's high artistic skill does not make us feel lonely because of the "narration." On the contrary, step by step, he grips our chest, making us unable to breathe, and forcing us to keep reading. In the meantime, when our chest feels tight, Mr. Silone gives you a hearty laugh with a bit of humor, but this hearty laugh does not completely relax your tight chest. On the contrary, after your hearty laugh, you feel even more tight, which means; the poor peasants are more exploited, and the cruelty of the fascists is even more displayed! This way of writing really deserves our attention.

### Life

— Hong Kuangcheng

Living in dryness, without any seasoning, and even unable to integrate with "new" elements. Here, like a prisoner in jail, the terrible monotony entangles him, depriving him of the joy of "life," submerging his hope, making him unable to seek anything, even "fantasy," cannot give him enjoyment.

When people are dissatisfied with life, they yearn for their future and envy other different lives. They want to learn, they want to improve life.

Some people say; life must be close to the "new" in order to explode little sparks, ignite people's life fire, towards the bright path. What is most taboo is to re-seek old dreams and walk the path that people have already trampled on and abandoned, which can make people decay. Unless it is an old man, an old man who is near his twilight years, their white hair is old, their hearts are lonely, they don't like change, they like to walk in desolation and detachment.

Swallowing dry and hard bread all day long, without drinking a sip of plain water or a glass of milk, will soon make you sick; life is the same, without any moisture, it produces supermen and misanthropes.

Life is even less conservative, always changing, it must absorb new elements, especially young people, cannot be bound in the old scope.

In this complex group of people, to obtain the truth, we must experience various lives, various different lives, dynamic and changing. Only in this way can we recognize this world, this humanity.

Live with the changes of life, don't create an ideal country, blindly lofty, but unable to recognize the social people.

We want to improve life, not be slaves to life.

### Dawn

— Original by Deng Sanan, Translated by Wang Fen

No one can say which moment in the trenches is the most tense. No one can single out any particular time and, with a dismissive tone, call it "a typical moment in the trenches." Life in the trenches is always the same. Relatively speaking, the most tense time is probably half an hour before dawn, which is the most suitable time for an attack, and also when people are most carefully defended. According to old war concepts, it was the most dangerous time, the time when the defender was weakest and most afraid of being attacked. Because darkness favors the attacker, just as night favors the lion; by dawn, they can hold the ground they have gained. Therefore, in every war, in every trench, at this perilous moment, the sentries are the most attentive in defense, and are equipped with more guards than during the entire night. When the first lark flies from the grass, they are on guard in the darkness. In any place, in any war, you can be sure that at this time, people will be crowding the breastwork of the trenches: while people in the cities are sleeping soundly, they are standing guard over there.

When the dawn begins to break, and the sky shows a fish-belly white color, gradually spreading, and the shadows suddenly become clearly visible, the time for attack has passed, and perhaps a faint feeling of pleasure will arise in the hearts of new soldiers; but in reality, isn't this moment just like any other moment? It is just an ordinary fragment of trench life.

The dawn shyly reveals itself, the breeze blows unintentionally, and while people are still watching the darkness, the light of dawn is already faintly visible in the east. When did the darkness fade? When did the dawn turn golden? Everything happens in an instant, in an instant that you cannot see. The cannons no longer flash; the sky is bright and clear; the morning is like the victory that is about to come during the tyrannical reign of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor. After dawn, the soldiers removed the bayonets from their rifles, stepped down from their posts in the trenches, and used steel rods to clean their rifles. This work is not done by all the soldiers at the same time, but separately; not only in the morning, but at any time, one cannot call all the soldiers to clean their rifles at the same time.

They wiped away the dirt or rainwater that had splashed on their rifles during the night; they disassembled the gun chamber to see if the spring was usable; they disassembled the breech plug, applied a little oil, and then reassembled the various parts that had been cleaned: thus, another night had passed; followed by a day closer to victory.

### A Complete View of Nan Tiesheng's Art (Part 1)

— Bing Jiu

Nan Tiesheng's short ten-day performance at the Golden Theater has generated quite different opinions. In fact, it is indeed commendable that Tiesheng, having come from amateur opera, is judged by amateur standards. However, it would be somewhat debatable to make harsh demands based on professional artistic standards. In the amateur period, having one skill is enough to become famous, while professional performers must be proficient in all aspects to be considered excellent. Now that Nan has become a professional performer, the standards for judgment should also be slightly stricter. I have listened to his "Complete Yutangchun" and "Silang Visits His Mother" twice, and I feel that although his art is refined, it has not yet achieved overall consistency. Therefore, I will describe my observations separately:

Appearance and Stage Presence: Stage presence does not completely equate to demeanor, nor does it purely refer to appearance. Rather, it is an abstract term that encompasses both demeanor and appearance. Nan's original appearance is already very handsome, and after applying makeup, he becomes even more beautiful. The contours of his face are slightly uneven due to the powder applied unevenly on both sides of the nose bridge, and the position of the pasted hairpieces is too far back, which is a bit of a flaw. His height and build are well-proportioned, and his weight is suitable. His appearance is luxurious, seeming fluid yet still, seemingly gentle yet not soft, lacking in coquettishness but with plenty of elegance. His spirit shines brightly without being outward, which is in line with the pursuit of dignity and solidity. Therefore, he performs tragedies far better than comedies, and playing the Qingyi role is more suitable than playing the Huashan role.

Singing and Recitation: Tiesheng's voice is both strong and gentle, broad and bright, sweet and mellow, possessing all of these qualities. His high notes do not crack, and his low notes flow smoothly, and he has a rich, watery sound, indeed possessing some of Wang Hua's style. Although Tiesheng studied with Yao Qing, his singing style is mostly privately learned from Wang Hua. The tail sounds of his soaring notes are somewhat indulgent, resembling the Huashan style, which is not the correct sound for Qingyi. In general, the flavor of elaborate singing is often thin and superficial (performers with deep skill can compensate for this deficiency in their voice), and it does not align with the principles of solemnity, chastity, elegance, and grace. Voices that are charming and seductive also deviate from this principle, and all of these do not meet the conditions for Qingyi. Tiesheng's dedication to this style may be to cater to the tastes of the general audience. However, his low notes are gentle and natural, similar to Huang Guiqiu, and he can often be heard singing one or two good phrases, his flavor leaning towards elegance. His breath control is excellent, which is very beneficial for performing melodies. The "joint trial" flows smoothly in one breath, with proper transitions, and is very pleasant to listen to. However, his articulation lacks consideration, and his rhythm is also unstable, which is due to a lack of stage experience and is not a serious flaw. In general, the good points of his singing are that his voice is good, his melodies are pure, he does not seek flamboyance, he always saves effort in simplicity, and he is beautiful and has substance. Moreover, his high notes are purely natural, not like Huang Guiqiu, who uses a rapid sound from the bottom of his throat to reach high notes, or Cheng Yanqiu, who uses a narrow throat to force high notes, which is very rare. His pronunciation is ambiguous, and his word sounds are even more incorrect, with a disease of being awkward and difficult to understand. The methods of intonation and the distinction between subject and object must be further studied. According to Tiesheng's style of acting, rhythmic recitation should take after Yanqiu, being elegant, accurate, and in line with the Qingyi style. Wang Hua's rhythmic recitation is soft and boneless, gentle and pleasing, which seems too greasy when applied to Qingyi. Qingyi recitation must be orderly in intonation, carefully choosing words and sentences, pronouncing each word as if it carries a thousand pounds of weight, while still maintaining its natural state, in order to properly fit the role. It should not be like the fluent and smooth recitation of various Huashan roles, which goes too far and loses the meaning of solemnity and grace.

On the night of the flood, he moved into a Western hotel. The location was relatively high, and there was no water when he moved in. The next morning, the water was two or three feet high, so he decided to leave Tianjin. At that time, the Taikoo Shuntian wheel happened to be docked at the port, so he managed to come to Shanghai. The ship was unbearably crowded, and food was a problem, so each person's food ration was only half of what it usually was. Furthermore, they encountered a hurricane along the way, truly a case of misfortune never coming alone. After the flood in Tianjin, most of the food was washed away, causing a huge problem. Therefore, even ordinary domestically produced biscuits cost several yuan in foreign currency per pound. A bottle of sugar sauce even cost five yuan in foreign currency. This has a huge impact on the livelihood of ordinary people. These disaster victims are in urgent need of relief, and it would be as kind as giving them a new life if all the great benefactors could quickly provide assistance. When asked about how theatrical performances could help with the disaster relief, he said that if someone were to initiate it, he would gladly help them succeed.

### Zhang Eyun Talks About the Tianjin Flood

— Man

Zhang Eyun came to Shanghai to escape the Tianjin flood. The reporter visited Zhang at Jin's mansion and talked about the flood in detail. The following is a record:

On the day the water came, it was raining heavily. On that day, the local alarm kept sounding, but the British and French concessions had not yet seen any accumulated water, so the China Grand Theater opened as usual on that day, with a crowded audience at the opening. By halfway through, the audience gradually withdrew, and by the time it was closing, most of the audience had left, as the situation was already very tense that day. The show ended around 5 o'clock, and the British Concession had already accumulated water, but the French Concession had not, so the night show was scheduled to proceed as usual. Around 7 o'clock, the French Concession was also flooded, and the water came very fiercely, so it was decided to stop the performance. When the water first came, it was about a foot deep, and it rose very quickly. When he left Tianjin, the water was about ten feet high at his residence, only one or two feet away from the second floor.

### Garbo's New Target

— Jingyuan

A year ago, when Swedish star Greta Garbo and famous musician Stokowski (the music conductor in "Blue Angel") were traveling together in Europe, Hollywood was rumored to be getting married, but at the time Garbo firmly denied the good news, saying that she and the musician were just closer friends. Until now, the mystery of this mysterious woman's marriage has never been broken.

Currently, the 34-year-old Garbo is filming "Madame Curie" (Ninotschka) with Melvin Douglas, so Hollywood is rumored to be in love with Dr. Gayelord Hauser, a well-known botanist, and newspapers and magazines believe that this is definitely not a rumor, because facts can prove it: Garbo has often spent time at the botanist's villa in Beverly Hills for the past two months.

Speaking of this botanist, he is very wealthy and loves movies. In the past five years, he was in love with the late female star Jean Harlow for a few months. Now he has become Garbo's new target, and Hollywood people are waiting for the day they get married.

### A Man of Courage

— Qihua

"Dodge City"

After the Civil War, when building the new Dodge City, the bully Jeff Surrett in Dodge City, relying on his many followers, did all kinds of evil. The residents were intimidated by the tyranny and dared to be angry but dared not speak out, but they were eager for treatment. Wyatt Earp led immigrants to Dodge City. After witnessing Jeff Surrett's evil deeds, he resolutely took the position of police chief and decided to eliminate the scum in the city. Newspaper editor Zoe Clemens hated Surrett's behavior and secretly collected evidence of his crimes, but was assassinated by Surrett. After Wyatt Earp captured the assassin, he escorted the prisoner to Wichita for questioning. He met Surrett's followers in the car and wiped them all out in one fell swoop.

This story tells us that trying to rule everything by relying on the power of tyranny will eventually lead to a day of collapse. The residents of Dodge City submit to Jeff Surrett only because they fear his tyranny; however, the fire of anger increases day by day with tyranny. Wyatt Earp is just the fuse, and the masses behind him are the force that destroys Surrett and his followers!

Under the excellent skill of director Michael Curtiz, the progress of the whole film is always tense and lively, especially the handling of several big scenes, which is extremely moving.

For example, Ewell Brown's drunken shooting, the cattle were frightened by the gun, running around, Ewell Brown could not avoid it, was trampled to death; and the fight in the hotel was very tense and vivid. The climax in the train at the end is even more outstanding. It is written like this: Wyatt Earp escorts the murderer onto the train; the train starts; Surrett's followers jump on the back of the train; crawling on the roof of the car; Abbie catches a glimpse of a figure crossing the carriage; the gangsters hold guns and monitor the driver; the rest of the gangsters walk to Wyatt Earp's carriage; Abbie's suspicion; the gangsters enter Wyatt Earp's car; Wyatt Earp and Dr. Irving alertly avoid it; both sides bombard; Abbie hears the gunfire and stands up; the car inadvertently catches fire; the murderer struggles in the flames; Abbie enters, is held by the gangsters, and forces Wyatt Earp to disarm; Wyatt Earp removes the handcuffs for the murderer in the flames; the gangsters leave the carriage and lock the door; the gangsters on the prairie fly horses to rescue people; Wyatt Earp smashes the door behind the car; the gangsters jump from the carriage onto horseback; Wyatt Earp and Dr. Irving shoot at the galloping horses; the gangsters are shot and fall off their horses... This scene is not only always trapped in a tense atmosphere, but also the descriptions in all aspects are as meticulous as hair.

In addition, delineating Dr. Irving's character adds a lot of fun to the film. Reducing the love between Wyatt Earp and Abbie also makes the whole film more compact.

Errol Flynn's Wyatt Earp still maintains his handsome and strong qualities. Olivia de Havilland's Abbie has not shown her strengths due to the limitations of the plot. Ann Sheridan only sang a few songs

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

When playing mahjong, Bian Chang always stood behind him. Whenever the gambler saw that the other had a big hand, he warned others not to call, and when he was about to call, he secretly told someone to discard a certain card. When he won, he clapped his hands and shouted, and said to the person who discarded the card, "Good boy, you are so good." If others let him win, he would still scold them. However, these people did not hate him. Whenever he won money, they would ask him for a reward. Although the gambler's appearance was fierce, in fact, he was very kind. If people followed his temperament, he would grant even impossible wishes. Ke Qin's voice was very strong in the past, and his pronunciation was solid and powerful. I have his old recordings of "Selling Rouge" and other movies. I often listen to them in my free time to relieve my love of opera. But now Chang Lao, Lin Wu, Shan Nong and Ms. Ke Qin's graves are all arched with trees. Looking back on the past, I am very sad.

Being Smart Ends Up Being a Joke

There are many famous opera performers who often like to rely on their own little cleverness to arbitrarily add or delete words in their singing and acting, or add some small gestures and clever movements, thinking that they can show their knowledge and appropriateness and show meticulous work. In fact, if one is really knowledgeable like the masters of opera, one can not only revise plays, but also write plays, and that is indeed often surprising and presented to the audience. It's just that I'm afraid that I don't have any real talent and learning, I only know a few more words than my peers. Because I have good relationships with people offstage, and I have become a popular performer, I want to add many tricks to my heart's content, so as to show my ability to be original, and ask the blind followers for a cheer; as for whether it fits the plot, I don't bother to think about it. This is exactly in line with the ugly character's words in the play "Lian Sheng Sanji": "Yo, hey, I really call you blinded!" (105)
