A portion of the Japanese troops who occupied Shenzhen yesterday retreated westward towards Nantou at 8:00 AM this morning. Currently, only several hundred people remain in Shenzhen. There was no gunfire this morning. The number of refugees arriving in British territory is quite small, so it is generally believed that the Japanese army is currently preventing residents from fleeing Chinese territory in large numbers.

According to official claims here, the Chinese authorities have instructed the citizens of Yichang to actively evacuate, and the troops have been ordered to defend the city to the death. Currently, the Japanese army is still far away, and the terrain is difficult, so the Japanese army's plan to attack Yichang will not be easy to achieve. (17th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

The Hong Kong government has not received a similar letter. However, several Chinese newspapers did indeed receive this letter. Each letter was accompanied by twenty yuan, requesting publication in the advertising column. The Chinese newspapers, suspecting the letter, did not publish it.

### Councilor Zhang Junli
### Urges the People to Support National Policy
### Striving to Save the Nation Under Central Leadership
### Rejecting All Acts of Splitting the Country

(Chongqing) National Political Council Councilor Zhang Junli issued a circular to the whole country on the 17th, strongly refuting the fallacies of advocating peace, and urging the people to unanimously support the national policy of resisting Japan under the leadership of the central government. His words on the righteousness of national unity and establishment were very insightful, stating roughly that the principle commonly adhered to by statesmen in modern countries on the day of war is external consistency, which contains three meanings: First, various parties should abandon their usual suspicions and grievances and strive to stop disputes; second, to contribute opinions to the government, so that it can exert its greatest combat capabilities; third, colluding with enemy countries and establishing another government is an act of destroying the country and disrupting discipline, which should be strongly avoided. If this principle is not adhered to, then the country has already fallen into division, so what battle can be spoken of? Indeed, where there is war, there must be peace. However, during the European War, Britain had Lord Lansdowne's advocacy of peace, and once opposed by public opinion, he withdrew his statement. France had Claudius' argument of making a separate peace with the German army, which led to his abandonment by the people and imprisonment. This shows how the principle of external consistency is implemented in modern countries. The government is the supreme organ of a country, and its establishment must come from the country's own strength, without allowing the slightest foreign influence to enter. A little concession becomes a puppet. This is why Liu Yu and Zhang Bangchang are cursed for all time. Now, nationalism is becoming more and more prosperous. How can this kind of painful history be allowed to be repeated? He then said that although the battle results of the past two years have not been fully up to the expectations of the people, the domestic unity is becoming stronger and stronger, and foreign aid is coming. The national character has not fallen to the ground and been exhausted. This is the result of the anti-Japanese policy. Today, the enemy's strength has not been exhausted, but their constrained situation is seen by the world. It is already obvious that they cannot take me and devour me. The government intends to work hard to govern and plan for prolonged resistance. The people must not vainly seek temporary peace for a day, so that they become the continuation of Taiwan and Korea. Therefore, I dare not evade and advise the people to unite under the leadership of the central government to support the national policy of resisting Japan and reject all acts of splitting the country. Only then can we answer the difficulties of our ancestors in building the country for thousands of years and comfort the heroic souls of the martyrs of the Republic of China. I respectfully offer my red heart and hope that everyone will work together with one heart and one mind to achieve it. (17th Dispatch)

### German and Italian Reporters Transferred to
### Manchurian Border

(Chongqing) According to Chinese intelligence today, two German communications reporters and one Italian communications reporter currently stationed in Beiping have been ordered by Tokyo's Axis officials to transfer to the border of "Manchukuo." This move clearly shows that the Japanese are preparing for a large-scale offensive against the Soviet Union, so German and Italian journalists must be transferred to that area.

### An Analysis of the Recent Situation in the Far East

Heads of state and cabinet members of various countries, those who bear the heavy responsibility of practical politics, and those who are entrusted with the ears, eyes, mouth, and tongue of the people have recently not concealed the extreme seriousness of the situation. There are countless examples of such people and their words. The focus of the problem is the recent developments in Danzig. The various movements related to Danzig are all reported in the newspapers and do not need to be elaborated on by us. Among them, Germany's scathing rebuke of the rumors of a four-power conference to jointly seek a compromise solution serves as a wake-up call to those who are still dreaming of a policy of appeasement. It shows that this problem has already progressed to the last two stages: First, Germany is determined to get it, and only sees which month, which day, and in what way it will be launched. Second, if Poland does not give it up after Germany's launch, it will only have to open the prelude to a world war. The matter is imminent, and disaster is pressing. How it will evolve and how it will tend to return is indeed the great mystery of the world today. I would like to put it aside and first discuss the world's second problem in the minds of Europeans and Americans.

The Far East problem is a part of the world problem; all the changes in the Far East are closely related to the world. Without discussing other things, assuming that China does not resist Japan or resists Japan and collapses in an instant, then the Far East will not become a problem; but Japan will become like a tiger with wings because it has control of China, and Germany and Italy will also combine with Japan and become like a tiger with wings, then Britain and France will either follow China and engage in resistance or follow the footsteps of Czechoslovakia and be slaughtered. How can they still contend for the so-called Danzig problem as they are today! From this point alone, it can be seen that the Far East problem and the world problem are inseparable, and that China's resistance is the mainstay for democratic countries to calmly deal with the world problem. Assuming that the democratic countries had taken the lead in checking the fierce offensives in the Far East and jointly curbing them at the beginning of the invasion, then not to mention the orderly international order, Germany and Italy would not necessarily have launched their offensives so quickly. Even if their ambitions were not restrained, Britain and France could have fully dealt with Europe, and how could the invaders have been as arrogant as they are today. It can also be seen that the reason why democratic countries are frowning today is still that they failed to fulfill their due responsibilities in the Far East in those years, and now they are suffering the consequences. It is only because Europeans and Americans have always regarded Europe as the center of the world; they also thought that on the day the European war broke out, they could not stay out of it, and that they could still stay away from the vortex of the Far East disputes; therefore, the so-called Far East problem was regarded by them as the second problem, but in reality, it was not so at first. Furthermore, as recent developments prove, those who regard the Danzig problem as the current center of the world problem, both sides in the局 have to regard the Far East as an important key in their calculations; then, how is the Far East problem the second problem!

What is the recent situation? (1) The Tokyo negotiations between Britain and Japan have gradually exposed the inherent nature of their contradictions. Yesterday's London telecommunication stated that the British government also acknowledged the slim hope for the future and only sought to avoid the sudden announcement of the breakdown of the negotiations. On the Japanese side, they are both feigning and using the art of capture and release and accusing the British of dual diplomacy, meaning that the British are superficially cooing with Japan, while trying to pull in other countries and waiting for the world to change. (2) The Japanese army in southern China suddenly attacked Shenzhen. Shenzhen is only separated from Kowloon New Territories by a body of water. Since then, the confrontation between Britain and Japan is not comparable to the Shanghai Concession and Puxi, but is like the north and south of Suzhou Creek; bridges can pass, and it is also like the Waibaidu Bridge on the Bund of the Huangpu River; heavy artillery range can threaten Hong Kong. The meaning of this is the threat to the Tokyo negotiations, and it is also an important arrangement for Japan to eliminate the British army, navy, and air force bases in Hong Kong when a world war occurs. (3) The staff meeting of the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow had the Soviet side proposing to demonstrate military strength to the Far East. When the three countries discussed political agreements, the three countries all criticized the implication of the Far East as nonsense. Now, the American Associated Press, the German Haitong News Agency, and the French Havas News Agency all have this news; the authorities of the three countries have no positive expression on this, but they are the most stable and ambiguous, and the British side, which most wants to isolate the Far East problem, has now stopped being indifferent. According to yesterday's Havas News Agency dispatch, "British responsible persons" said that "if Japan joins the German-Italian military alliance, then the scope of the staff talks of the three countries should be expanded to include the Far East." (4) The spirit and attitude of the Soviet Union in dealing with all problems always fall between "being scrupulous about every detail" and "not being sloppy in the slightest." In short, it does not exaggerate, but it is neither excessive nor insufficient. Now it is said that the proposals they made at the staff meeting of the three countries are like that, and their actual actions include the air force, actual exercises on the Sea of Japan outside Vladivostok, and the army, which is constantly being transported to the Far East. (5) According to some sources, the reporters from German and Italian newspapers stationed in Tianjin have now been ordered to leave Tianjin and go to the outside of Shanhaiguan; newspaper reporters are the first tentacles of the country to observe and listen to the movement.

All of these recent situations are what can be seen in the Far East in the midst of the extremely serious global situation. From Danzig to Shenzhen, from responsible British officials to German and Italian reporters stationed in Tianjin, the relationships are vertical and horizontal, complex and varied, causes and effects, right and wrong, whether they are real or virtual, or credible or dubious, we are indeed difficult to summarize the consciousness and actions of various countries, to pursue the consistent thread, and to judge their inevitable trend; even if we take a step back to analyze all the recent situations, determine which is the main and which is the guest, and weigh how to prioritize, it is still difficult. I would like to choose one aspect of them and extrapolate it: Although the Far East problem takes the Sino-Japanese War as the theme, Britain has a close relationship of interest and pain with it, now close and now far, now brave and now timid, daring not to advance and unwilling to retreat, seeming to sympathize with China in resisting Japan, and seeming to flatter Japan in strangling China. China is determined to resist Japan, and Japan is at a crossroads, so the relationship between China and Britain is very clear, while the relationship between Britain and Japan is full of deception and intrigue. Although the Tokyo negotiations are the theme of the two countries' dealings, their maneuvering is extremely subtle, and it is the question of whether Japan should join the German-Italian military alliance. Extrapolating from this issue, being afraid of the strengthening of the unity of the aggressive group, the rising arrogance of Germany and Italy, which increases the crisis of war if the world has not yet fought, and expands the scope of war if a great war has already been fought, and Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and even India and the Suez Canal are threatened; because of this, it does not want Japan to join the German-Italian military alliance, which is Britain's absolute view, the first. In diplomacy, it maneuvers vertically and horizontally and bluffs; in wartime, the more countries it has, the better, and its naval power ranks between second and third in the world. Its value needs no explanation; because of this, it welcomes Japan to join the military alliance, which is what Germany and Italy expect, the second. Although Germany and Italy's wishes are extravagant, they are willing to settle without war. They have no certainty of victory, so how can they have the determination to start a war. By forming an alliance with Japan, Japan hopes to extricate itself from its predicament and risk triggering a world war, forcing Germany and Italy to help Japan fight because of Japan, which violates its original wish; there will be more bad luck than good luck if there is a war. Even if it wins, its own wounds will be difficult to recover, and it can only watch Japan monopolize the Far East. What enmity does it have with China, but it loses the Chinese market. This is a loss that outweighs the gain; even if it does not fight because of this, it will make Germany and Italy's estrangement from the Soviet Union and the United States even deeper because of Japan. This is bearing a false name and suffering real harm; because of this, the alliance problem that it has been advertising to the Japanese side, and recently it has increasingly expressed its indifference, which is what Germany and Italy are suffering, the third. By joining the German-Italian military alliance, it will deepen its estrangement from democratic countries, and by joining the military alliance, it will deepen the vortex of the European situation, and even stake its navy on the European situation, which is not only unhelpful to the war against China, but also makes more enemies and makes Britain's hope for compromise even weaker; this is the Japanese moderate faction that hopes for a military alliance but hesitates, the fourth. Joining the military alliance will unify the will and strengthen the regime domestically; it will show strength to Britain and make Britain yield; even opening the military alliance into a world war situation, so as to obtain a way out of the desperate situation of the military alliance against China; this is the hard-working spirit of the Japanese youth, who see the military alliance as having a different world, the fifth. This is still a normal evolution. In the European War in the past, wasn't Italy able to benefit from Britain and France by abandoning Germany and Austria? There is no morality in the international community, let alone a precedent; so how can we promote Germany and Italy to the brink of the volcano by today's joining the German-Italian military treaty, agitate the world into a bloody state, and then seize the opportunity to use Germany and Italy to negotiate prices with Britain and France. This will not only trap China in isolation, but also make it impossible to get what it wants from Britain and France; Germany and Italy have fallen into a deep abyss, and Japan is the chosen son; following its precedent, history has the ability to repeat itself in such a cycle; this is also one of the thoughts of those who advocate joining the alliance, the sixth.

From the above analysis, we know the divergence of the future; and Britain, in its contemplation and hesitation, and at a loss, not in the slightly distant future, still has room for weighing the gains and losses, and is only responding to the present, with a single thought of loyalty and loss haunting it.

### U.S. Government Opposes Revising the Status of the Shanghai Concession
### Undersecretary of State Reaffirms U.S. Attitude
### The Case of the Insult of an American Woman in Tianjin is Being Negotiated
### The Contract for the Purchase of Aircraft by Japan Was Signed Very Early

(Washington) U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the U.S. attitude toward Japan's proposal to revise the status of the Shanghai International Settlement has not changed. On May 17, the U.S. Congress sent a memorandum to the Japanese side, in which the U.S. argued that the current situation in China is not suitable for considering the Japanese proposal. The U.S. attitude toward this issue has been consistent from beginning to end. Welles commented in detail on various issues in the Far East. He said that the State Department has carefully considered the case of Mrs. Lichtfield being insulted in Tianjin. The State Department has received a detailed report on Mrs. Lichtfield being slapped by a Japanese sentry in Tianjin. Before receiving a reply from the Japanese authorities in Tianjin regarding the U.S. protest, he cannot officially comment on the case, but he can assure reporters that the U.S. government has "carefully considered" the case. Regarding the State Department's approval of the Douglas Aircraft Factory to sign a new contract worth US$1 million with Japan Airlines, Welles solemnly declared that the U.S. government's policy of opposing the sale of aircraft to countries that bomb civilians has not changed. The contract was signed before the U.S. State Department announced its policy. (17th United Press Dispatch)

(Washington) Regarding the case of Mrs. Lichtfield, an American citizen in Tianjin, being slapped by a Japanese sentry, Undersecretary of State Welles recently made a statement to the press, stating roughly that the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin, Gauss, has lodged a protest with the Japanese consulate. The State Department is still studying this case, but does not intend to express its views before receiving a response from the Japanese government. (17th Havas Dispatch)

(Washington) The American Douglas Aircraft Factory once sold military aircraft to Japan, which were shipped to that country last month. The American newspapers commented on this matter, expressing dissatisfaction with the government. Undersecretary of State Welles recently made a statement to answer it, stating roughly that Secretary of State Hull advised various aircraft factories last year not to sell aircraft to countries that bomb civilians. This policy has not changed. The contract between the Douglas Factory and Japan was signed before Secretary of State Hull issued his advice. (16th Havas Dispatch)

### British-Japanese Negotiations
### Still Stalled

(Tokyo) The British-Japanese Tokyo negotiations have not been opened for the seventh meeting because the instructions from the British mainland have not arrived. British Ambassador Craigie met with Minister Kato on the 17th. Ambassador Craigie said that during the meeting a few days ago, he had predicted that the negotiations could be formally resumed around the 16th or 17th. However, because the economic issues are complex and cumbersome, the mainland government has not yet been able to make a decision on the instructions, so he must ask the Japanese representatives to give him a little more time. He expressed his great regret. Minister Kato expressed regret for the British side's dilatory attitude and urged the British side to take effective and appropriate measures as soon as possible. Finally, the two sides exchanged their final opinions on the security issues on which they had reached a consensus. It is expected that the British-Japanese negotiations will be difficult to resume within this week. (17th Allied Dispatch)

(London) Regarding the Tokyo negotiations between Britain and Japan, people in the government say that the British position has not changed. In other words, they will not hand over the silver deposited in Tianjin, and they will also refuse to discuss the currency issue in North China. Regarding this issue, the hope for a compromise between the two sides is very slim. The reason why the government has been slow to send instructions to the British ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, is to avoid the current negotiations from suddenly declaring a breakdown. (16th Havas Dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, U.S. Ambassador Craigie met with Kato, the chief Japanese representative attending the round table conference, at the Japanese Foreign Minister's residence this afternoon, requesting a further postponement of the meeting. It is heard that Craigie stated that the British government wants to consult with the autonomous region and a third country on the very complex economic issue of Tianjin, so London's instructions have not been issued for a while, but they will be sent soon. In his reply, Kato asked the Ambassador to explore appropriate and effective methods for opening the meeting as soon as possible. It is heard that Craigie and Kato exchanged their final opinions on the issue of maintaining security and order in Tianjin during the talks. It is expected that the meeting may not be resumed before Monday next week. (17th Reuters Dispatch)

### British Consul-General in Tianjin Lodges Written Protest with Japan Demanding Cessation of Anti-British Movement; Chinese Employees of British Firms in Tianjin Go on Strike

(Tianjin) The British Consul-General in Tianjin, Jamieson, today lodged a written protest with the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Tashiro, accusing the Japanese authorities of inescapable responsibility for the anti-British demonstrations occurring in the occupied areas, and demanding immediate cessation. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)

(Beiping) According to news from this area today, following the strike of 150 employees of the British Shang Company in Jinan, the Chinese employees of the British Asiatic Petroleum Company have also successively gone on strike. Furthermore, according to Chinese newspapers controlled by the Japanese, Chinese employees of other British firms in Jinan will also soon go on strike. (Associated Press, 17th)

(Qingdao) The anti-British sentiment here has greatly subsided due to the inaction of the Anti-British Committee in recent days. Consequently, the Japanese naval landing force guarding the British Consulate has been withdrawn. As for American naval sailors, they are very active here, as one US dollar can be exchanged for as much as 18 "Joint Reserve Bank Notes." Therefore, the sailors are extremely generous in their spending, no longer taking rickshaws but instead riding in cars, and indulging in food and drink without regard for prices. (Associated Press, 17th)

(Hong Kong) People in Hong Kong, both Chinese and British, generally believe that the Japanese military actions near Hong Kong are directly related to the deadlock in the Tokyo negotiations. It is believed here that the Japanese military actions have two objectives: firstly, to coerce Britain into fully accepting Japan's demands regarding the Tianjin incident; and secondly, to cut off the transportation route between Huizhou and Hong Kong. Since the fall of Shantou and Shanwei, Huizhou has become a crucial route for transportation between Hong Kong and Chongqing. If this route is cut off, the blockade of Hong Kong will inevitably be strengthened, as Hong Kong relies on supplies from Chinese farmers, which must pass through this route. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)

### Central Ministries and Departments Will Not Relocate Again

(Chongqing) Regarding the rumor spread by the Japanese that the various ministries and departments of the Chinese government, under the orders of Chairman Chiang, would soon relocate from Chongqing to Jiading (transliteration), authoritative sources here have solemnly denied and forcefully stated that such rumors are completely unfounded. It is claimed that most government agencies are currently located in the suburbs of Chongqing and have no plans to relocate elsewhere. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)

### Non-stop Heavy Rain Causes Collapse of Tianjin Outer Embankment; British Concession Flooded, Rushing to Build Embankments; Locusts Swarm in Disaster Areas, Ravaging Dry Land

(Tianjin) A Reuters correspondent, after venturing out to inquire about the local flood situation today, learned that officials are extremely anxious about it, as the water level in the disaster area is currently 18 inches higher than the highest water level of the 1917 flood. The outer embankment outside Tianjin city has now collapsed, and part of the city is already under water. The Japanese concession authorities, adjacent to the settlement, are now building embankments along the border to prevent the water from flowing in. The French concession, fearing being affected, is also building embankments along the border with the Japanese concession and along the riverbank. The British concession, in addition to building embankments along the border with the French concession and along the riverbank, is also building embankments along the former German concession border, fearing backflow of the floodwaters. If the river water flows into the British concession, the affected area will be the bustling commercial district, starting from the riverside and north to Qiangzi River. This area is the original British concession. Crossing the river is the later expanded concession area, which is at a higher elevation and can be spared concern. Sources here say that the next few days will be a dangerous period, as the floodwaters caused by heavy rains west of Beiping, discharged by the Hai River and its tributaries, will reach Tianjin within a few days. Even if they escape the flood now, there will eventually be flooding within the next three months. The Hai River is now level with the banks, with overflows in several places. The British concession is already flooded, especially Victoria Street, where the sidewalks on both sides are several inches deep in water. This is due to overflowing sewers and accumulated rainwater, as the heavy rain has not stopped in the past 24 hours. According to the Hai River Dredging Bureau, the water flowing into the city of Tianjin comes from the ditches of the Jinpu Railway, which are now completely blocked. Looking out from a high place, one can see a vast expanse of water to the southwest of the British concession, dotted with trees and houses. It is said that the water level is level with the Jinpu Railway roadbed, relying only on sandbags for blocking. The authorities have now requisitioned villagers and transported them by truck to the disaster area to carry out emergency rescue work, in an effort to protect Tianjin. Adding to the people's distress, locusts in the disaster area are swarming, gathering on dry land, and devastating fields of crops and vegetables. Tianjin already has a limited food supply, which is now even more scarce. Villagers are now beating gongs and carrying poles to drive away the locusts. (Reuters, 17th)

(Hong Kong) Tianjin news: Continuous overcast and rainy weather in the north in recent days, especially in Shanxi Province. There was also heavy rain in Pingjin on the 16th, and transportation on all railways was disrupted. The northern section of the Jinpu Railway has been suspended, and the Tianjin West Station is completely submerged. The east-bound train on the Beining Railway only goes to Changli. The water volume of the Hai River in Tianjin has increased further. The Japanese side has breached several places in the South Canal and Yangliuqing to stabilize the Hai River. Therefore, if the heavy rain in Shanxi Province does not stop, the Tianjin water situation may still be unavoidable in the end. (16th telegram)

### Chongqing Newspaper Comments on the Significance of the Japanese Army Occupying Shenzhen: Militarily Insignificant; Japan Denies Intention to Blockade Hong Kong

(Chongqing) Today, Chinese newspapers all prominently reported on the tense situation on the Kowloon border, as British and Japanese troops are now facing each other across the border in Shenzhen. Various rumors of surprise are circulating among the Chinese, with some saying that the Japanese army has already entered Kowloon. The "Shishi Xinbao" today published an article titled "Where is Britain Going?", stating that the Japanese occupation of Shenzhen has no other military value besides preventing vegetables from being transported into Hong Kong. If Britain does not compromise with Japan on the Jianghai Customs, there will be no blockade of Tianjin. Without a compromise between Britain and Japan in Tokyo, there would be no threat of a blockade of Hong Kong today. If Britain still dreams of a peaceful resolution in Tokyo, then there will be no peace in the Pacific, from Australia to the Indian Ocean. All British territories are at risk of being blockaded at any time. (Reuters, 17th)

(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of the Navy today answered questions from foreign journalists regarding whether Japan intends to blockade Hong Kong or cut off transportation between Hong Kong and the Chinese hinterland, saying that the Japanese Navy has no intention of blockading Hong Kong, nor is there any need to take such action. Since Japan occupied or blockaded commercial ports, the blockade in Central and Southern China has been intensified. Therefore, the Japanese Navy does not want to cause international disputes with foreign friendly nations. However, the battle of Guangzhou last autumn was aimed at destroying the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, so as to cut off transportation between Hong Kong and the Chinese hinterland. The current military preparations are to clear out guerrillas and bandits in Guangdong Province, in areas not within the British Concession near the border. (Reuters, 17th)

### Germany Rejects Compromise Solution, Seeks to Annex Polish Corridor

German Newspapers Promote Polish Anti-German Atrocities; War Preparations Undertaken Along the Border

(Berlin) Hitler today discussed the latest developments in the European situation with Air Minister Goering and Police Chief Himmler at the Berghof, who went there to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Fuehrer's enlistment as a volunteer. According to political figures here, Germany will consider convening a conference to discuss the technical details of recovering Danzig, but is determined not to convene a conference to discuss whether Danzig should be returned to Germany. The newspapers here continue to publish daily reports of anti-German atrocities in the Polish Corridor, and the issues of the Corridor and Danzig are now gradually being merged. The German "普報" (newspaper) stated, "We must not allow other countries to be the judges of our major issues, as this issue is not only related to Germany's economy, but also involves Germany's honor. The existence of the Polish Corridor is detrimental to Germany's glory." Goebbels' mouthpiece, the "進攻報" (newspaper), also stated, "What we hope to resolve now is not only a European issue, but also includes our demands for colonies. Germany advocates establishing true peace in Europe and will oppose all compromise solutions, negotiations, or conferences. The Polish Corridor and Danzig are Germany's own issues and have nothing to do with others. We will establish justice and peace in Europe regardless of whether Britain opposes it." (Reuters, 16th)

(Paris) The French government yesterday sent a note to the US government regarding the developments in the Danzig situation, reportedly worded without expressing great pessimism. After meeting with Foreign Minister Bonnet, Prime Minister Daladier had an hour-long conversation with the US Ambassador to France, Bullitt. Although the French government's semi-official sources said that the matter was not serious, diplomatic circles were very concerned about whether Hitler would take any action on the matter before the Nazi Party Congress, which is scheduled to be held in Nuremberg on September 2nd. The French government indicated that the current crisis in Europe is not more serious than that of Munich. According to unconfirmed reports, Poland has concluded a permanent military alliance with Britain. In the treaty, Britain not only guarantees Poland's independence, but also guarantees the independence of Poland's neighboring countries. These "neighboring countries" may include Lithuania, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, or others. (Associated Press, 17th)

(London) After the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, Burckhardt, met with German Fuehrer Hitler, some sources reported that the Danzig issue would be resolved by a conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. British officials firmly expressed opposition and said that any international conference without the participation of Poland and the Soviet Union would not be considered. It was also said that no suggestions have been made by any party regarding this matter. The intention of spreading this rumor is nothing more than to make Poland suspicious of the intentions of Britain and France. In addition, Foreign Secretary Halifax has recently returned to Yorkshire to continue his vacation and plans to return to London with Prime Minister Chamberlain at the beginning of next week to discuss the national situation. (Havas, 16th)

Warsaw Political figures here commented on the rumors that the Danzig issue would be resolved by a conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, saying, "Any international conference without our country's participation cannot discuss issues related to our country." The various rumors are likely issued by Germany to test the attitudes of various countries. In fact, Poland has always been willing to resolve various issues directly with its neighbors and does not want to involve third countries. The Polish government has not accepted the repeated suggestions of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, US President Roosevelt, and Pope Pius XII to mediate the dispute between Germany and Poland, precisely for this reason. (Havas, 16th)

Warsaw After Wesner, the leader of the German Germanic Youth Party, was arrested for espionage in the Upper Silesia province of Poland, political figures here expect Germany to lodge a protest with the Polish government. In addition, Polish newspapers published in Germany are often banned. The Polish government is reportedly considering retaliating against newspapers published by the German minority. (Havas, 17th)

### People in Berlin are Anxious and Uneasy

(Berlin) People in all circles in Berlin are increasingly anxious about the current situation in Europe, and are using the military preparations near the Polish border as a topic of conversation. It is said that all farmers in the border area have been ordered to move their livestock and harvested agricultural products to the interior. Motorized units of the army have also been ordered to carry supplies and depart tomorrow, destination unknown. It is said that the issues of Danzig and the Polish Corridor will be resolved before the 27th of this month so that Fuehrer Hitler can travel overland to Tannenberg (Dębów, East Prussia) to preside over the commemorative ceremony after the Battle of Tannenberg in the European War, without having to detour by sea. All these claims are inconsistent, and people are anxious and uneasy. In addition, the tone of German newspapers towards Poland is roughly the same as the propaganda campaign conducted against Austria, the Sudetenland, and Bohemia-Moravia. The gist of the argument is that after the Polish issue is resolved, lasting peace can be established in Europe. However, this kind of statement has been seen repeatedly, and a peaceful situation has not yet been established. People in various European countries, having learned from the past, dare not believe it. Some German political figures say that Fuehrer Hitler has instructed Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to issue a statement that once Germany has obtained satisfaction on the issues of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, it may participate in an international peace conference in the hope of breaking up the peace front. If this attempt fails again, Fuehrer Hitler will take appropriate military measures so that Germany's Pomerania province can be connected to East Prussia. However, after Foreign Minister Ribbentrop issued the above statement, the initial reaction of Britain and France was rather cold. The London Times even advocated granting the right of self-determination to 8 million Czechs, just as Germany is demanding autonomy for the 400,000 residents of Danzig. The German side was very unhappy upon hearing this, and at the same time, the anti-Polish movement in various newspapers intensified, which is another reason for the general unease here. However, if Germany does take action against Poland, Britain and France will certainly come to the aid of the country they guarantee. Although the German public believes this without a doubt, the government authorities have different opinions, either saying that Germany's military action will be as swift as lightning and Britain and France will be unable to help Poland, or that defeating Poland will take several months, and after the start of the war, the conflict will inevitably spread widely. (Havas, 17th)

### Major Polish Espionage Agency Cracked

Warsaw A large-scale espionage agency set up by Germany in the Upper Silesia province of Poland has recently been cracked by the authorities, and 70 suspects have been arrested, including 10 Germans. Wesner, the leader of the Germanic Youth Party, is also among them. According to the investigation, the party has indeed maintained close contact with the espionage agency, and a large number of documents concerning Poland's border defense have been seized in the party headquarters. (Havas, 16th)

Katowice According to sources here, as of midnight on the 16th, the number of ethnic Germans arrested in Upper Silesia, Poland, has reached about 1,000, including Jan Jantosch, chairman of the Polish German Workers' Association and former member of parliament. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)

### German Newspapers Oppose Compromise Solutions

(Berlin) German newspapers are vehemently opposed to convening an international conference to discuss the Danzig issue and have expressed unwillingness to accept any compromise solution. The Abendpost (evening paper) stated, "The Danzig and Polish Corridor issues involve Germany's honor, and there is no possibility of establishing a compromise solution. Convening an international conference is also absurd." The Angriff (attack paper) stated, "The Danzig and Polish Corridor issues are Germany's issues and have nothing to do with others. Any compromise solution, negotiation, or conference is unacceptable to Germany. In short, we should not rely on Britain's power to maintain the rule of law and peace. If necessary, we will oppose Britain, and we will not care." (Havas, 16th)

(Berlin) Last night, German newspapers were filled with alarming news about Danzig and the Polish Corridor. The Hamburger Tageblatt (Hamburg Daily) said, "According to the will of the Germanic people, solving the Danzig issue is the glory of Greater Germany, and it has become a matter of urgency today." The Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger (Berlin Local Advertiser) said, "From a transportation point of view, the Polish Corridor cannot but be resolved. Today, the ethnic Germans in the Polish Corridor are being abused, which is an insult to Germany's honor." The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (German General Newspaper) also said, "Germany is divided into two, and transportation is threatened by the enemy, which is related to our honor." The semi-official Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro (German News Agency) also expressed its views, roughly saying that Germany's honor and vital demands will not allow London and Geneva to interfere and obstruct. Germany believes in rights and power, and does not care about the rest. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)

### The Danzig Situation Has Not Changed

(Paris) After Burckhardt, the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, recently visited German Fuehrer Hitler, rumors spread that the Danzig issue would be resolved by a conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. Hitler himself and German newspapers have refuted this statement. French officials are not surprised upon hearing this, but say that the fact that German newspapers are now referring to the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues as involving German national honor is making the German people's attitude even stronger, which is worrisome. Fuehrer Hitler is scheduled to deliver an important speech at the memorial ceremony in Tannenberg (in East Prussia, where the German general, former president Hindenburg, defeated the Russian army in 1914) on the 27th of this month, at which time he may present extensive demands, such as connecting German Pomerania province with East Prussia. Regarding this, Hitler originally demanded a strip of land 15 kilometers wide be carved out of the Polish Corridor to build a highway to connect Pomerania with East Prussia. Now it is feared that he will demand that the entire Polish Corridor be annexed to Germany, which is very concerning. The Belgian newspaper "La Nation Belge" reported that the German and Italian governments have suggested to the Roman Catholic Church that European countries should conduct a political truce for 30 days so that Britain, France, Germany, and Italy can hold a conference on the Danzig issue. Now that Germany has rejected this proposal, the news reported by the newspaper is self-defeating. Similarly, US Republican Congressman Schafer intends to propose the same suggestion to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference (currently being held in Oslo, Norway), which will also fail. In short, the Danzig situation has not changed. Britain and France have accepted the commitment to guarantee Poland and will fulfill it when necessary. Among them, Britain's commitment to Poland will be strengthened in the short term. However, the claim that Poland has requested Britain to guarantee the Baltic coastal countries is not accurate. (Havas, 16th)

### Italian Newspapers Advocate Direct German-Polish Negotiations

(Rome) Roman newspapers advocate that direct negotiations between Germany and Poland are the only way to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Danzig issue. All newspapers unanimously imply that this is due to official authorization. Il Giornale d'Italia (The Italian Daily) says that Poland's independence is not threatened and that Poles have nothing to lose by negotiating with Germany, but if Poles prefer war, then they will "gamble their entire existence." Poles must remember that in a war, Italy will fulfill its responsibility as a member of the Axis. Il Popolo di Roma (The People of Rome) rejects possible conferences or compromises, saying "Yet now several rights do not need conferences, and must make those who demand them satisfied." (Reuters, 16th)

### Danzig Troops Scheduled for Inspection Today

Danzig The first inspection of the Danzig "Heimwehr" (Home Guard), which is composed of special Nazi party guards to increase the police strength of Danzig, will be held here in recent weeks. The unit has 1,500 troops and is commanded by Goetz, the chief of the Nazi Party's special guards. The army organization includes four infantry battalions, one machine gun company, two armored vehicle companies, one assault company, and one platoon each of engineers, signalers, and transport troops. Forster, the Nazi party leader of Danzig, will first present the military flag, then conduct the inspection. Since then, Danzig's military preparations have become more obvious, and infantry maneuvers are held in the suburbs every day. Many of Danzig's youths have been conscripted into the auxiliary police force, and the majority of the positions left vacant have been filled by women. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)

### Border Between Poland and Germany: National Socialist Party Members Provoke

Polish Police Repeatedly Beaten; Polish Customs Officer from Danzig Arrested

Warsaw: Today, several members of the German National Socialist Party attempted to cross the border into Poland at Buden, a location on the German-Polish border. Polish police immediately intervened and were attacked. German police stood by and did not intervene. Furthermore, two Polish customs officers from the Free City of Danzig were arrested on the evening of the 13th of this month on false charges by the city police, who accused them of secretly transporting anti-National Socialist propaganda. The Polish government, in addition to denying the secret transportation, has instructed its High Commissioner in Danzig, Chodacki, to demand their immediate release from the City Council. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Free City of Danzig: According to German sources, several Polish border guards opened fire on several German journalists near the town of Chiu at 6 PM today. Fortunately, no one was hit. The City Council has lodged a strong protest with the Polish authorities, demanding the punishment of the border guards responsible for the incident. This has not been confirmed by the Polish people in this city, and they claim to know nothing about the protest from the Danzig City authorities. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Warsaw: A Polish border guard was shot and wounded on the German border on the 9th of this month. On the 14th of this month, another police officer was assassinated by a member of the Germanic Youth League. The perpetrators of both cases have now been arrested by the Polish police authorities. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

(Berlin): Leading figures and experts on National Socialist law will hold a meeting in Sopot from August 21st to 25th to discuss Danzig and other Eastern European issues, with particular emphasis on the Danzig dispute. They will attempt to prove that Danzig and Germany's attitude towards the current issues is justified. Representatives from Danzig and National Socialist foreign groups will also attend, and the opening ceremony will be conducted by Forster, the leader of the Danzig National Socialist Party. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

(Berlin): According to the German News Agency, Poland has recently closed a section of the Upper Silesian border near Katowice, preventing approximately 10,000 workers from crossing into Germany to work. The workers' border permits have been confiscated and destroyed. According to another German report, mass arrests have occurred throughout eastern and upper Silesia in Poland. Newspaper reports claim that a man and two women crossed the border at Bautzen, and when a Polish policeman tried to arrest them, a struggle ensued, and the policeman was killed. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

### Key Figures from Danzig and Poland Discuss Local Events

Facilitated by the League of Nations High Commissioner

Paris: The Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, has begun talks today with Greiser, the President of the City Council. Those in charge here are very pleased to hear this, saying that it is due to the mediation of the League of Nations High Commissioner, Burckhardt. The issues discussed are limited to local events in Danzig and do not involve the city's legal status. As for Burckhardt's meeting with the German leader Hitler a few days ago, it was initiated by Burckhardt and was not undertaken with any specific mission, unlike Lord Runciman's mediation of the Czech issue last year. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Warsaw: The Polish High Commissioner to the Free City of Danzig, Chodacki, met with the League of Nations High Commissioner Burckhardt yesterday. At noon today, he also held talks with Greiser, the President of the City Council. He flew back here on a special plane in the afternoon and immediately reported the situation to Foreign Minister Beck. Afterwards, Foreign Minister Beck met separately with the French Ambassador Noël and the Romanian Ambassador Franasovici to discuss the matter. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### Inter-Parliamentary Union: Peace Proposal

American Representative Proposes a 30-Day Political Truce

Oslo, Norway: At today's meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the American representative, Republican Congressman Fish, proposed that the four countries of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy observe a 30-day "truce" on political issues to resolve various international disputes through peaceful arbitration, with the President of Switzerland mediating the Danzig issue. The Speaker of the Norwegian Parliament, Hambro, immediately objected, saying that this approach would not be acceptable to representatives of small countries. If this were implemented, we would be in danger of approving a second Munich Agreement. Thereupon, the Bulgarian representative, Yanfordalov, declared that his country's territorial demands on Romania remained unchanged, but if the great powers wished to conduct an investigation, they were willing to accept it. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### Baldwin's Speech: Spirit of Democracy

If War Breaks Out, the British Will Do Their Part

(New York): Former British Prime Minister Lord Baldwin said in a speech at the Civil Education Conference banquet here last night, "If war breaks out, we will see unprecedented unity and great material resources in the British people. In our hearts, we believe that this war is about fundamental human freedom. We must do our part in this war to achieve our goals." Baldwin continued, saying that democratic governance is the most difficult of all forms of government, because in totalitarian countries, individual citizens do not bear responsibility, whereas democratic countries are the opposite. Baldwin concluded, "All the doctrines we hold are no less than those of totalitarian countries, but our doctrines are nobler and further-reaching than theirs, and therefore success is more difficult. It involves human cooperation according to their free will to cooperate with God to improve humanity." (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Anglo-Polish Agreement: No Signing Date

### German Soldiers Invade French Border, Beat French Customs Officer

French Foreign Ministry Lodges Protest

(Paris): Regarding the dispute that occurred yesterday afternoon at the French-German border, French customs officer Lixia was beaten by several Germans. This incident occurred within French territory, and the French Foreign Ministry has lodged a protest with the German government. The incident occurred yesterday afternoon between 4 and 5 PM when a German car, carrying several soldiers, drove into French territory near the town of Haining. French customs officer Lixia immediately stopped them, informing them that they were on French territory. Unexpectedly, the soldiers and the driver in the car beat him until he fell unconscious. His handgun and raincoat were also taken away. By the time he regained consciousness, the perpetrators had already fled, so he was unable to record the license plate number of the car. He was also unable to discern which unit the soldiers belonged to. However, Lixia speculated that they were probably deserters. At this time, the examining magistrate of Metz, France, has joined forces with the customs supervisor and the police authorities to conduct an investigation. The German police have also launched an investigation in the hopes of identifying the perpetrators. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### Britain's Largest Aircraft Carrier

Launch Ceremony

(London): During the launch ceremony of Britain's largest aircraft carrier, the Formidable, built at a cost of £4 million, an unfortunate incident occurred in Belfast today, resulting in the death of one woman and injuries to twenty others. Just as Air Minister Sir Kingsley Wood and his wife arrived at the launch site, a piece of wood fell off the wooden scaffolding supporting the ship. Hundreds of workers gathered under the ship, preparing to assist in launching it, saw fragments of wood falling around them from the large scaffolding and hurriedly fled for their lives. Fortunately, none suffered serious injuries. At the same time, important fragments of wood and iron screws fell into the crowd of thousands of spectators gathered in the specially designated area of the Harland and Wolff shipyard, causing the tragedy. Several tugboats, which were preparing to tow the ship after it was launched, saw the ship moving towards the water and quickly accelerated to avoid it. Officials in charge, seeing that the ship had begun to move, asked Mrs. Wood to quickly throw a bottle of champagne against the side of the ship and christen it the Formidable. The religious ceremony was only held after the ship was safely in the water. According to an official from the Harland and Wolff shipyard, the ship entered the water safely ahead of schedule, and Mrs. Wood was able to complete the launch ceremony before the ship left the slipway, and there was no danger of the ship capsizing. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### French Air Force: Exercises over England

(London): Several French heavy bombers flew over British airspace last night for exercises and then returned to their country after reaching their destinations. By this morning, another 150 bombers and 60 fighter planes had flown over the cities of southern and central England, Liverpool, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, and Oxford, for "bombing" exercises, and a "bombing of London" was scheduled for the afternoon, at which time many British planes would take off to intercept them. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

(London): French air force units "invaded" England twice last night and this afternoon. This is the first time the French air force has conducted flight exercises over England. A total of 200 French bombers participated in the first time last night, all of which reached their destinations and then flew back to their bases, remaining in the air for about seven or eight hours. In the second "invasion" this afternoon, the first plane appeared over London at 1:50 PM. A total of seven bomber squadrons participated this time, and their objective was to attack many important cities, including Liverpool, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, and Oxford. Reconnaissance planes led the way for the bombers, identifying targets and studying the current situation. These reconnaissance planes later joined up with the bombers over London. British fighters took off to "intercept" them. According to a French communiqué, the purpose of this exercise was to test the formation of light and heavy bombers, totaling 200 from the General Staff, and to simultaneously test the effectiveness of British and French sound detectors and the cooperation of British air defense forces in preventing the advance of bombers. The French Minister of Aviation did not announce the type of aircraft participating in last night's flight, from which base they departed, or the length of the flight. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Japanese Five-Minister Conference: Postponed

Tokyo: The decision on specific measures to deal with the European situation was discussed and decided by the emergency Five-Minister Conference on the 8th of this month. The Five-Minister Conference was originally scheduled to reconvene on the 18th, but because the draft proposal prepared by the Foreign Minister had been largely completed, and the Prime Minister, the Ministers of the Army, Navy, and Treasury had all examined it, but considering the situation from all angles, the draft proposal had not yet reached a mature stage for review, the government decided to postpone the Five-Minister Conference scheduled for the 18th and convene it after considering the situation and the situation has improved.

### Britain, France, and the Soviet Union May Expand Scope of Military Talks

If Japan Joins the German-Italian Military Alliance, the Scope of the Talks Will Include the Far East

(London): Regarding the talks between the staff officers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the British and French governments, due to the Soviet Union's request to expand the scope of military talks, will grant broad authority to their respective military delegations. However, British officials say that the rumor that the British, French, and Soviet agreement will extend to the Far East has not been considered. However, if Japan joins the German-Italian military alliance treaty, the talks between the staff officers of the three countries will naturally expand in scope to include the Far East. Political figures here are paying close attention to the evolution of Japanese foreign policy. Although the claim that Siam has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact has been denied, Japan's activities in that country have been very active for several weeks, which is noteworthy. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

(London): US officials are maintaining a very taciturn attitude regarding the progress of the Moscow military talks. Today, the newspapers have only published that the military delegations of the three countries attended the reception held by the French Ambassador Naziare yesterday evening, with no other new reports. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 17th)

(London): The staff officers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are conducting talks in Moscow. The fact that Poland and Romania have refused to send representatives to participate is a problem for most people here. Informed sources recently declared that while the military actions regarding Western Europe have not encountered difficulties, the extent to which the Baltic states can cooperate with the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe has become an issue. The British and French governments are exchanging views on this matter and will probably instruct the military attaché of the French Embassy in Poland to make contact with the Polish military authorities. Fortunately, relations between Poland and the Soviet Union have recently shown signs of improvement, and it is possible that Poland may allow Soviet troops to pass through its territory in wartime. In addition, Britain and France will also contact Romania, but the hope of success is probably very slim. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)

### International Student Congress Sends Telegram to British Foreign Secretary

(Paris): The International Student Congress convened by the World Student Association is now holding its third meeting here. Representatives of students from 35 countries have sent a telegram to British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, requesting that the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin not be handed over to the puppet government. The telegram stated, "Students from 35 countries, now holding an international conference in Paris, urge the British government not to hand over the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin to the puppet government, otherwise it would be contrary to Britain's traditional justice. Member states of the League of Nations will be suspected of recognizing the aggressor country, which will have serious international implications." (Havas dispatch, 16th)

(Paris): The third meeting of the International Student Congress convened by the World Student Association is in progress. One of the Chinese representatives, Xie Shoukang, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts of China University, delivered a speech this morning, stating that the goal of democratic politics is similar to the concept of universal harmony of the ancient Chinese sage Confucius. Since taking office, Chinese Minister of Education Chen Lifu has made many cultural contributions. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### German-Hungarian Diplomatic Talks

Review of Relations Between Germany, Italy, and Hungary and the German Minority Issue in Hungary

(Berlin): Although German newspapers are trying to downplay the significance of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's talks with Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky in Salzburg, political figures are paying close attention to them, saying that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had made concrete suggestions and is discussing them this time. Although the content of the suggestions has not been released, Germany is paying close attention to the legal status of the German minority in Hungary. Interior Minister Frick once consulted with the Hungarian government on behalf of the German government. The fact that Frick also participated in the meeting between the foreign ministers of Germany and Hungary makes it clear that the issue of the German minority is the focus of the discussion. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Vienna: Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky arrived in Salzburg this afternoon, dined with German Interior Minister Frick, and then went to Fuschl Castle to meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

(Rome): Well-informed sources here declare that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will come here from Salzburg, Germany, in the coming days to hold important talks with Foreign Minister Ciano to review the entire issue of relations between Germany, Italy, and Hungary. As for the claim that the Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy is about to visit Germany and Italy, it is not true. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

(Moscow): "Pravda" comments on Germany's oppression of Hungary, saying that "German fascists are now encouraging Hungary to demand Croatia from Yugoslavia and Outer Transylvania from Romania, attempting to profit from it. The purpose of this trick by the aggressors to provoke conflict between the small countries of Central and Southern Europe is to manipulate everything and establish their own hegemony, and fascist Germany needs agricultural Hungary as a source of raw materials. Regarding this point, people in Hungary with clear minds have long understood everything, so they firmly believe that all small countries must form a united front, pursue and follow the major countries that truly love peace, and resist German aggression together." (TASS dispatch, 16th)

### Hong Kong is Now Armed

Construction of Air Defense Headquarters – Comprehensive Island Defense

Hong Kong Correspondence: Recently, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly serious. British military and political authorities are actively strengthening the defense capabilities of Hong Kong and Singapore, paying particular attention to the air force. Additions to the aircraft fleet and the opening of airfields are the most prominent examples. It is now learned that, in view of the urgency of the situation, Britain has dispatched large squadrons of aircraft, such as bombers, fighters, reconnaissance planes, and airships, to reinforce the Far East. The majority of the air force has been concentrated in Singapore. A considerable number of aircraft have also come to Hong Kong. Most of the airships and aircraft in Singapore are capable of long-distance flights and can fly directly to Hong Kong at any time to assist in reconnaissance and combat should war break out. With the current strength of Hong Kong and Singapore's military forces, they are truly capable of withstanding any attack.

Air Force Construction

The Hong Kong authorities are also striving to carry out air force construction, adhering to the intentions of the British government. The Hong Kong Air Defense Equipment Department, in view of the inadequacy of the current Air Defense Headquarters facilities and the inability to fully develop its work, has petitioned the Hong Kong government to approve the allocation of large sums of money to construct a magnificent Air Defense Headquarters. After detailed consideration, it was decided to implement various plans and commence construction on the 7th of this month. The construction site is located at the foot of a small hill at the corner of Stubbs Road and Morrison Hill Road in Happy Valley. The piling work is currently underway. According to Air Defense Commissioner Mr. Shek Pak Kin, the construction cost of the headquarters is estimated to be about 100,000 dollars. The construction is currently being expedited and is expected to be completed by November 1st of this year. In the future, an air-raid shelter will be built inside the headquarters, capable of accommodating 100 people, to serve as a place for air defense personnel to take refuge during air raids on Hong Kong. The headquarters will also have practice rooms for various staff members, equipped with various electrical machines and telephones, to enable communication officers to practice communication work, so that they can cope with emergencies in wartime.

New Ships Deployed to Hong Kong

While air defenses are being actively constructed, naval defenses are also being strengthened. It is reported that the British cruiser HMS Gloucester, after returning to Chatham from Africa, has suddenly been ordered to East Asia to join the China Station fleet. This ship is replacing HMS Folkestone, which recently returned to England. In addition, Colonel Lee Sharpley Griffin, the commander of the British garrison in Tianjin, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday aboard the troop transport HMS Dilwara and will soon proceed north. It is noted that the former Tianjin garrison commander, Wilson, passed through Hong Kong two weeks ago on his way back to England.

Increased Military Spending

Due to increased tax revenue in recent years, Hong Kong's annual military contributions to Britain have also increased. Military spending in Hong Kong is also increasing year by year. According to an official announcement by the British government, Hong Kong has jumped to second place in terms of military contributions from British colonies. The Straits Settlements contribute the most, at £700,000 per year, followed by Hong Kong at £379,000. India and Ceylon contribute only £216,000 annually.

Military Equipment

Mr. Duncan McIntyre, a reporter for the London Scottish Daily Express, recently passed through Hong Kong to investigate the situation. He telegraphed a report to the Scottish Daily Express, stating in essence that although the British garrison in Hong Kong is small, they will be able to cope calmly in the event of war because of preparations made in peacetime. Hong Kong is about 9,000 miles from Europe. When a shot is fired in Europe, the Far Eastern imperial possessions are immediately affected. Mr. Duncan also stated that he had spent a day traversing all parts of Hong Kong and concluded that Hong Kong is no less than a second Gibraltar. He personally saw the entire island dotted with machine-gun nests, as dense as a beehive, with layers of barbed wire, forming a natural barrier. The cost of deploying defense works this year has reached 500,000 gold pounds, accounting for nearly 20% of total tax revenue. Although most of the coastal areas of China have now fallen, if the Japanese army's strategy of quick victory is unsuccessful, economic exhaustion will be fatal. Recently, they have intensified their anti-British campaign. The Japanese army in Guangdong is only 50 miles from Hong Kong, while Singapore is 1,500 miles away. Therefore, the general opinion is that the Japanese army will invade Hong Kong sooner or later, and it is worrying that the British will not be able to defend it for long. However, according to Duncan's investigation, the British garrison in Hong Kong, except for women and children who need to be evacuated, unanimously expressed their determination to defend the territory to the death, fulfilling their national duty of defending the land. He himself also believes that any powerful country that attempts to attack and occupy Hong Kong, or to subdue it through a blockade, will ultimately fail. Hong Kong is self-sufficient for a long-term defense, which is its military value. A blockade alone can only serve as a warning to the British Empire, but it has little military effectiveness.

Oil Depot Precautions

The Asiatic Petroleum Company has several large oil storage tanks in Causeway Bay, which have been there for many years. In the past, the area was far from the city center and there were few residents. Today, however, the city is becoming increasingly prosperous and the population has grown significantly. More new buildings have been built near the area, and they are often fully occupied. Now, in these tense times, in the event of war and air raids on Hong Kong, the oil depots are most likely to catch fire, endangering the safety of residents in the area. According to the company, the oil depots are not dangerous. Even during air raids, the oil depots are the most targeted by the enemy, but all air defense equipment is extremely tight and can ensure safety. If incendiary bombs are dropped, all fire-fighting equipment is new and can quickly extinguish the fire. Moreover, each tank is individually isolated by solid barriers, so that even if one tank is hit and catches fire, it will not spread to other tanks. If oil flows out of the damaged tank, it will remain within the barriers and will not spread elsewhere. At that time, several anti-aircraft guns will be installed to provide armed protection, ensuring that aircraft cannot fly close to drop bombs, and if they do, they cannot hit the target. Hong Kong currently has a large reserve of kerosene, so there is no need to worry about shortages in case of emergency.

Water Supply Issues

The authorities have also paid attention to the issue of water supply in Hong Kong during wartime. Therefore, in the overall air defense plan, detailed consideration has been given to the protection of reservoirs to maintain the water supply during wartime. A plan has been decided and is being implemented step by step. A complete defense plan is in place to defend against enemy aircraft dropping poison bombs and destroying reservoirs during air raids. At the same time, the authorities are actively seeking ways to utilize the supply of local wells to supplement the water from the reservoirs.

### Pirate Raids on Islands in Fujian Province

Chuan Shi and Da Zhui Islands are Occupied – Lianjiang and Hui'an Counties Also Invaded – Refugees from Pingtan Flee to Fuzhou and Transfer to Northern Fujian

Fuzhou Correspondence: Recently, coastal islands in Fujian Province have been occupied by pirates colluding with the Japanese. These include Haitan (i.e., Pingtan County), Nanri, Chuanshi, Dongsha, Dapai, Dazhui, Nangantang, and Mazu Ao. Among them, Haitan Island is the largest, followed by Nanri Island. However, except for Chuanshi and Dazhui Islands, they have no value in terms of military, political, or economic aspects. Therefore, the Japanese only use pirates to rule these islands and have not sent troops to land. However, Chuanshi Island is located outside the port of Fuzhou, and Dazhui Island is located outside the port of Quanzhou. Occupying these two islands is sufficient to blockade the entry and exit of foreign ships from Fuzhou and Quanzhou. Therefore, they are guarded by the Japanese naval landing force, but the number is not large, only dozens of people in each place, because the area is very small and cannot accommodate a large number of troops. The pirate leader currently active in the eastern Fujian waters is Yu A'huan from Fuqing County, about 40 years old, who claims to be the commander of the joint forces of the three counties of Fu (qing), Pu (tian), and Ping (tan). According to his propaganda, he has a thousand men under his command. Part of his military supplies is supplied by the Japanese (in fact, they exchange it for looting strong men and women), and the food and salaries are entirely looted from the people. A few days ago, he sent more than a hundred men under the cover of seven Japanese planes to invade the Tailing and Beijiao villages in the third district of Lianjiang County. It is found that these villages are all coastal areas, and the residents all make a living by fishing. They transport and sell their products to Fuzhou, and the sales are very extensive. They are wealthy districts in the entire county. After the pirates landed, they searched door-to-door and looted all food, cash, and valuable items. Before leaving, they also took away the fishing boats and fishing nets. After the pirates left, the Japanese planes dropped incendiary bombs wildly, burning down more than 800 houses. Now, these two villages have been completely reduced to ruins. According to the county government report, the losses amounted to more than 500,000 yuan. Moreover, the Taku village in the southeast corner of Hui'an County, where the residents also make a living by fishing, was recently invaded by four Japanese warships carrying more than fifty soldiers under the cover of five planes. They looted extensively and abducted many strong men and women. The joint defense office, primary school, and slightly larger houses were all set on fire. After this disaster, all the residents of the village have moved into the county seat and suburbs. After Pingtan County was occupied by pirates, the residents, unable to bear the harassment, have been crossing the sea to flee to the territory of Fuqing County on the opposite shore. They have been sent by the county government to Fuzhou for temporary shelter and will be transferred to Qingliu and Mingxi counties in northern Fujian to engage in reclamation. According to reports, although the puppet maintenance association in Pingtan County has been established, the puppet chairman, Zhang Qingju, and the secretary, Cai Kenan, are both local bullies who run opium dens and gambling houses, so they have no power at all. The pirates levy donations and demand salaries in the county seat, and they loot at will in the villages. There are no Japanese soldiers on the island, only two Japanese women who direct the actions of the puppet association and the pirates and communicate with the Japanese warships anchored off the coast of Baiquan in the Min River by radio.

### List of County Magistrates Announced by the Jiangsu Provincial Government

Taixian Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently commissioned county magistrates for various counties to strengthen the administrative structure of the guerrilla areas. The list is as follows: Lu Xuanzhi for Huaiyin, Lu Tongxuan for Suqian, Sun Xinfu for Haimen, Tang Yaoyu for Chuansha, Ma Bosheng for Fengxian, Xia Lizhi for Nanhui, Yang Xiufeng for Kunshan, Shen Lixiang for Wuhui, Xu Jiaqiu for Jiading, Li Leng for Songjiang, Hong Lanxiang for Baoshan, Gu Yanru for Changshu, Shen Jinghua for Wu County, Zu Ren for Putuo, Xu Letong for Jinshan, Cai Renbao for Pu , and Bu Chao for . Other counties are also undergoing changes.

### Japanese Army in Guangzhou Plans to Enter Shameen to Arrest People

Repeatedly Rejected by the British and French Concession Authorities – Japanese Troops Can Only Cause Trouble at the East and West Bridges

Guangzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army in Guangzhou has been repeatedly requesting to search and arrest so-called dangerous elements in Shameen, but has been strictly rejected by the British and French concession authorities. Unexpectedly, a team of Japanese military police even attempted to break into the East Bridge of Shameen yesterday, claiming to arrest wanted criminals at a certain hotel. The French concession guards closed the bridge gate tightly, ready to fight. At the same time, British, American, and French warships anchored in Bai'etan also raised fire and were on alert, and the situation was very serious. The Japanese army, seeing the strong attitude of the Shameen authorities, did not dare to rush in. Instead, they sent a small number of soldiers to station around the East and West Bridges of Shaqi, harassing the Chinese and foreigners entering and leaving Shameen. Currently, most of the Chinese who work in Shameen dare not go to work, and foreign residents in Shameen also rarely go out.

### Japanese Plane in Taizhou Catches Fire and Burns After Touching Electric Wires

Three Planes Crash in the Fields

Xinghua Correspondence: At 5:00 PM on the 3rd of this month, four Japanese planes took off from Yangzhou and flew directly towards Taizhou and Xinghua in the northeast. Before reaching Taizhou, they suddenly encountered a heavy thunderstorm. Three of the planes immediately caught fire and burned down, crashing in the fields of a village 30 miles away from Taizhou. The remaining plane immediately returned to Yangzhou.

### Xitang Town, Jiashan County Bombed by Japanese Planes

Jiashan Correspondence: At 7:00 AM a few days ago, six Japanese planes flew from Jiashan Airport to Xitang Town, Jiashan County. They dropped more than 20 bombs on Tangdong Street, Zhongtang Bridge, and Wanfu Teahouse, the busiest areas of the town. At that time, the farmers were gathering in the market and were caught off guard. More than a hundred people were killed or injured. Hundreds of shops on Tangdong Street, the essence of the town, were turned into ruins. For a time, women and children fled for their lives, vying for escape, and their cries shook the sky. Many jumped into the market river and drowned.

### Japanese Spokesman Declares: No Blockade of Shanghai Concessions Imminent – Situations in Shanghai and Tianjin are Different and Require Separate Consideration – Newspaper Articles Appear Provocative

The North China Daily News reports that a Japanese spokesman stated yesterday (the 16th) at a press conference that there is no danger of the Shanghai International Settlement or French Concession being blockaded by the Japanese army today or tomorrow. Such measures depend entirely on future events. Based on the current situation, there will be no events that will make the blockade of foreign-administered areas here inevitable. When asked whether European developments would affect possible Japanese actions here, the spokesman said that Asian events are unrelated to the European situation. After numerous questions from reporters, the spokesman made the following remarks:

Actions Depend on Disregard

The Japanese army has occupied the Shanghai area for nearly two years. In the Tian-Craigie Agreement, Britain acknowledged that the Japanese army had to take certain measures for its own protection. However, the current situation in Shanghai requires a kind of factual acknowledgment. If activities supporting Chiang Kai-shek that are detrimental to military interests continue unabated, the Japanese army will have to take a new stance. What will trigger this new stance is a question of the extent of the activities.

Blockade Rumors Dismissed

When asked what impact any Tokyo compromise would have on the Shanghai situation, the response was that the situation here is different from the current situation in Tianjin and requires separate consideration. The issue of blockading the British and French Concessions has caused great anxiety and has led to widespread rumors of a possible blockade. These rumors must be dismissed. The spokesman explicitly stated that a blockade is possible, but not necessarily happening.

Hong Kong Actions to Stop Arms

Regarding reports that the International Settlement and French Concession are preparing to deal with a possible Japanese blockade of the city, senior officials of the two concession administrations have denied this, calling the suggestion "too ridiculous to be worth commenting on." When asked if reports that supplies from southern China via Hong Kong were also being blockaded were true, the Japanese spokesman replied that the current Japanese military operations near Hong Kong are part of a coastal blockade to prevent weapons and ammunition from reaching the Chinese mainland.

Court Documents Not Allowed to Be Published

When asked to publish the details of the Japanese note to the French Concession Bureau regarding the courts, the spokesman said that the note was merely a response to the French side's suggestions on the matter. The Japanese side found the suggestions unsatisfactory and could not publish the details of the note. When asked if rumors that the French authorities suggested establishing a mixed court were true, the response was "If we answer this question in the affirmative or negative, we will reveal all the details."

No Military Solution

When asked if the Japanese side would resort to force if negotiations failed to transfer the courts, the spokesman said that he could not answer. A reporter continued that the Japanese newspaper "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" stated today (the 16th) that there were only these two options. The response was that this may be the newspaper's opinion. A reporter said that the "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" has close ties with Japanese officialdom, but the spokesman smiled and did not say a word.

Newspaper Articles Appear Provocative

The North China Daily News reports that the more moderate Japanese newspaper in Shanghai, "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun," stated in an editorial yesterday (the 16th) that the Japanese authorities should immediately take control of the Chinese courts in the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession and shut down banks affiliated with the Chongqing government. If Japan does not take these steps, enemy activities in the foreign-administered areas of Shanghai will intensify and be their own fault. If diplomatic talks fail, the use of force to take over the courts in the French Concession is a "firm determination." Many disputes may arise if the French authorities do not recognize the new situation in Shanghai and act in good faith.

The Special District Court and Chinese banks are organs of the Chongqing government and operate openly in the two concessions. Court personnel are appointed by Chongqing and apply the laws of the Chiang regime, which is evidence of "enemy activities" in the foreign-administered areas. The courts must be administered by the Japanese or "Reformed Government" authorities; otherwise, the hope of establishing peace in the foreign-administered areas is like trying to climb a tree to catch a fish. Chinese banks obtain funds in the Shanghai foreign-administered areas to finance China's

Resistance Against Japan

And negotiate the purchase of military supplies to support General Chiang. Many other organs of the Chongqing government, under the protection of the two concession authorities, plan to disrupt the rear of the Japanese army and use these areas as a base for hostile actions against Japan. The Japanese government "cannot tolerate" the open existence of the courts and the four major Chinese banks. The Japanese authorities will immediately question the two concession authorities on how to deal with the 3,000 to 8,000 Chinese soldiers and their weapons who retreated into the concessions. It is reported that a large number of

Detained Chinese Soldiers

Have been released and their weapons handed over. It was a "mistake" that the Japanese side did not take over all the organs of the Chinese government when Shanghai fell in 1937. The stage has now been reached where this action should be taken immediately. The Japanese government determined its policy towards the National Government on January 16 of last year. The new regime has gained the power to take over the Chinese government's organs in Shanghai without further hindering the rights of third countries.

### Public Bus Fares to Increase – Application Filed with the Municipal Council – Talk of Another Tram Fare Increase

The Continental Daily reports that yesterday (the 16th), it was learned that the British-owned China General Omnibus Company has applied to the Municipal Council for permission to adjust fares in order to increase its bus fares in the International Settlement. Since the Municipal Council has already approved the tram company's fare increase, it is widely believed that the Council will approve the bus company's application. The Shanghai Tramway increased its fares on June 9. What the extent of the bus fare increase will be, and on what date the new fares will be implemented, if approved, was unknown yesterday. However, it is generally said that the bus company's application seems very normal, given the sharp increase in gasoline and kerosene prices. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the China General Omnibus Company experienced increased business due to the increase in population on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek,

More than compensating for the losses on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, and therefore did not increase fares. At the same time, it is widely believed that the Shanghai Tramway will apply for another fare increase. A representative of the tram company replied to inquiries, saying that they were currently considering this move, and that "there is good reason for this move."

### British Consular Court Rejects Case of Four Chinese in Tianjin – Claims Petitioner is Not Acquainted with the Chinese – Lawyers Reportedly to File Successive Appeals

Regarding the extradition of four Chinese in Tianjin, after Mr. Licks, a British lawyer from the Ellis Law Office in Shanghai, submitted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the British Consular Court in China based on a telegram from London, the consular court judge, Jones, after several studies, according to Western sources in Shanghai yesterday, decided on the case yesterday morning

To Reject It

It is heard that the reason for the rejection is that the original petitioner failed to state the facts of the case, and only requested legal remedies based on the information he had obtained. It was deemed that the reasons for the petition were not sufficient, and therefore the above-mentioned judgment was given. According to other sources, the petitioner will

Continue to Appeal

The final appellate body for such cases is the British Privy Council. In addition, The China Press reported that the British Consular Court in China this morning (the 17th) rejected a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by Chinese terror suspects detained by the British authorities in Tianjin. It is heard that the defense lawyer for the case will

Appeal the Court's Decision

And will continue to appeal, if necessary, until the case is appealed to the British Privy Council. Judge Jones' judgment stated that the defense lawyers for Mr. Fulan and Mr. Bianwei petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to be issued to certain police officers and prison officials in the British Concession of Tianjin, ordering them to immediately bring the four Chinese detained in connection with the Tianjin assassination of Cheng on April 9 of this year to the court for questioning. The defense counsel appeared

Four Defendants' Names

Irrelevant Notice. However, the names of the prisoners must be confirmed and drawn into the writ. If the form is not complete, it is doubtful that I can issue this writ. The petitioner on behalf of the four Chinese is only a person who is unacquainted or volunteers, and has no right to represent the prisoners in court, and may not petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Moreover, this petition does not have the necessary

Prisoner's Statement

Or a statement from someone authorized to represent the prisoner, or a statement explaining that the prisoner was oppressed and unable to make a statement, but only the lawyer's statement based on his own information, knowledge, and belief. Therefore, this petition must be dismissed.

### Vegetable Control Determined Difficult to Implement

The Japanese side had posted notices in Pudong, intending to transport vegetables from Pudong to Hongkou for sale, implementing a disguised form of control. This move changed the day before yesterday and was not implemented. It is understood that the matter was entirely the work of low-level Japanese personnel colluding with local tyrants in Pudong, hoping to profit. The Pudong Navy had already approved it, but the Hongkou side was afraid that bad people would take advantage of the opportunity to disguise themselves as vegetable vendors and cause trouble, so they did not agree. As a result, the initiators of this plan all failed. It is heard that their ambitions have not been quelled and they are still secretly trying to smooth things over.

### Pacific Hurricane Dissipated – Temperature Reached 93.7 Degrees Yesterday – First Hot Day After Autumn

The newly formed hurricane near Guam in the Pacific Ocean has evolved to the point of dissipation after being stagnant yesterday. There are no new winds rising in the Pacific. The highest temperature in Shanghai yesterday rose to 93.7 degrees, the first hot day after autumn.

### Three Japanese Pilots Killed – Wrecked Plane Still in Fields Yesterday

According to reliable sources, at around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 16th), a Japanese military plane was practicing aerobatics in the western suburbs of Shanghai when it suddenly crashed near the Xujiahui Railway Station south of the Zhongshan Bridge due to mechanical failure. Three pilots were killed instantly. Fortunately, the plane was not carrying explosives, so the residents were not harmed. The bodies of the pilots have been taken away by the Japanese side. The wrecked plane remained in the fields yesterday.

### The Four-Line Isolated Army's Supply Situation: A Statement from Commander Xie; Supplies Previously Provided by Local Charitable Organizations; The Shanghai Municipal Council's Advance Payment Has Been Reimbursed by the Government

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Xie Jin'yuan, commander of the Four-Line Isolated Army, issued a statement regarding the army's supply situation, offering clarifications. The statement is as follows:

The National Government Has Repaid the Funds and There is Still a Surplus

(1) The Sihang Warehouse is close to the concession, and bullets and shells are flying about, causing concern for the lives and property of people in the concession. We received instructions from the Consular Body resolution, which instructed the British and American naval and military commanders to request our highest authorities to order a withdrawal. From October 31st, 1937 (Republic of China Year 26) to November of last year, our supplies were provided by local charitable organizations. From December of last year to August of this year, a total of nine months, I borrowed 4,500 yuan from the Shanghai Municipal Council each month, totaling 40,500 yuan. I issued formal receipts for all of these. The Shanghai Municipal Council requested the Chinese government to reimburse the advance payment. In April, the Council received 43,600 yuan. The statement that "not a single penny of funding was paid" is untrue. The Chinese government still has 3,100 yuan at the Shanghai Municipal Council. (I plan to write another article in the future to share the detailed situation with the world).

There are Precedents in Public Law and History

Now, I will briefly cite one or two examples of international law and historical precedents. Article 11 of the Fifth Part of the 1907 Hague Convention on the reception of troops of belligerent powers by neutral countries stipulates that "Neutral Power may allow interned officers to pledge their word not to quit its territory without permission, and may leave them at liberty to choose their place of residence, subject to any regulations which it may be necessary to impose upon them". Article 12 stipulates that "Unless there is a special convention to the contrary, the neutral Power must supply the interned with the food, clothing, and lodging required by humanity. The expenses of internment shall be made good at the conclusion of peace." The most notable historical example is the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, when Switzerland received over 80,000 French soldiers and 10,000 warhorses, and France had to reimburse Switzerland for maintenance expenses totaling as much as 11 million French francs after the war. During World War I, Switzerland received troops from both the Allied and Entente powers. Switzerland felt overwhelmed with the expense of providing maintenance, and the number of people was impossible to count.

Xie's Statement: Reasons for Withdrawal

(2) But I must state first that our withdrawal at the request of a third party cannot be equated with desertion. (3) Whether reimbursement is possible in the future is not something I can say today. However, some people, seeing that the Shanghai Municipal Council is facing financial difficulties, are acting as alarmists, speaking without holding back. I believe that what they really want to say is that the Hongkou District of the Public Concession should be returned to the Shanghai Municipal Council as soon as possible, and the various restrictions around the Concession should be lifted promptly, so that the Shanghai Municipal Council's depleted financial resources can be somewhat relieved.

### The Fate of Jewish Refugees En Route to Shanghai Still Undecided; Discussions Between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese Consulate Yield No Results; If the Japanese Side Does Not Accommodate Them, They Will Be Denied Landing

According to the North China Daily News, the fate of the 500 Jewish refugees currently en route to Shanghai remains undecided because the meeting between Miura, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, and Fessenden, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, on Tuesday to discuss the possibility of housing these refugees in Hongkou has not yielded any agreement. The matter is currently under

Consideration by Both Sides

And no further meetings were held yesterday (the 16th). Yesterday (the 16th) was the deadline for Jewish refugees in Shanghai to register with the Japanese authorities to reside and do business in Hongkou. If the Japanese side strictly implements its memorandum of July 10th, those arriving in Shanghai will not be allowed to stay north of the Suzhou Creek. According to reliable non-official sources, Fessenden pointed out during his meeting with Miura that there is a shortage of housing south of the Suzhou Creek, and expressed hope that the Japanese authorities would

Grant an Exception

For the 500 people arriving in Shanghai in the coming weeks to reside north of the Suzhou Creek. "But if the Japanese authorities do not agree to allow those arriving to reside north of the Suzhou Creek, then there is a clear possibility that they will be denied landing, as it is expected that the Shanghai Municipal Council will not allow these people to reside south of the Suzhou Creek." When reporters asked members of the refugee care committee here yesterday, they all declined to comment, only expressing the hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities, who are very sympathetic to the plight of these refugees, will allow those

En Route to Shanghai

To disembark here. According to Japanese sources last night, a certain ship returning to Japan from Europe arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 64 Jewish immigrants who disembarked. After that, no more immigrants were allowed into Hongkou. Since the first group of 223 Jewish refugees arrived on an Italian mail ship on September 23rd of last year, the number of Jews in Shanghai has increased to about 15,000.

### Reinforcements Added to the Blockade Line on North Jiangxi Road; Only Haining Road is Passable; Some Shops are Closed

Since the Japanese side blocked the eastern side of North Jiangxi Road from the Molai Bridge northward to Baz Road on the 29th of last month with barbed wire and wooden frames, leaving openings at Chongming Road, Wenjianshi Road, and Haining Road, at the intersection of the Northern District of the Public Concession and Hongkou, only Chongming Road and Haining Road were passable after the special precautions taken for the two-week anniversary of the Shanghai Battle. Moreover, people entering and leaving the intersection of Chongming Road and Jiangxi Road must have a permit and a vaccination certificate to pass. If they only have a permit, they still cannot pass. Therefore, in reality, only Haining Road is passable. Yesterday, twenty to thirty men and women were seen detained in the barbed wire at the western entrance of Chongming Road because they did not have a vaccination certificate. The rest were not allowed to enter or exit and were turned back. The shops along the eastern side of the road within the blockade line were seen yesterday handing things to each other through the barbed wire, which was quite inconvenient, so some shops have closed down. Also, because the barbed wire on the wooden frames there was very thin, the Japanese soldiers were seen yesterday adding wooden stakes and iron nets to the defensive works along Baz Road south to Tiantong Road.

### Konstantinoff as Acting Soviet Consul-General; Consul-General Simansky on Leave; Office Temporarily Headed by Konstantinoff

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently received a notification stating that during the leave of absence of B.M. Simansky, the Soviet Consul-General in Shanghai, all affairs of the Consul-General's office will be handled by M. Konstantinoff.

### Surcharge on Foreign Postal Remittances; Set at 100%; To be Implemented Next Month; Temporary in Nature, May be Cancelled in the Future

According to the English-language China Press, Shanghai has just received news that postage for mail sent to foreign countries will soon be double the current rate, while domestic postage will remain unchanged. It is reported that from September 1st, a "temporary exchange surcharge" of 100% will be levied on overseas postage. The post office will not double the postage, as it will be simpler to restore the original rates when the postage returns to normal. This measure seems overly analytical, but its effect is the same. The reason for the surcharge is that postage is calculated at the same value when converted into various currencies. Postage is based on the gold franc as the standard. Previously, the legal tender was equal in value to one gold franc. Currently, the gold franc is worth more than 2.5 yuan in legal tender. The authorities are levying a surcharge to not make legal tender equal to a gold franc, but to increase the current postage by one hundred percent, so that it can be calculated. Implementation will begin on September 1st. So far, only telegram notification has been received. Shanghai is expected to receive the complete written order in two or three days, at which time an official announcement will be published in the newspapers. This news was learned from the postal authorities today.

### Significant Results Achieved After Domestic Remittance Management; Inland Remittances Reduced from Over 100,000 to 20,000-30,000; Remittance Amounts Strictly Limited; Remittance Fees Significantly Increased

Since the Ministry of Finance implemented management of domestic remittances, significant results have been achieved, and capital fleeing from the interior to the occupied areas has been greatly reduced. Recorded on the left:

Effects of Managing Domestic Remittances

A reporter from Datong News Agency learned from the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau that before the implementation of domestic remittance management in Dongchuan, Xichuan (i.e., Sichuan), Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, and other places, the total amount of money remitted to Shanghai each day was over 100,000 yuan. However, since the implementation of management, it has been reduced to 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Is this not a good effect of management?

Remittance Amount Reduced, Remittance Fee Increased

Previously, 1,000 yuan could be remitted from the interior to Shanghai each day, then it was reduced to 500 yuan, and then further reduced to 200 yuan. Since the implementation of management, only 50 yuan can be remitted. The remittance fee for remittances from the interior to Shanghai has also increased from 5 to over 10 cents per yuan to 15 to 46 cents. Even the remittance fee for remittances from Zhejiang to Shanghai has increased to 11 cents.

### Norwegian Minister Talks About the Far East Situation

According to the Continental Times, the Norwegian Minister to China and Japan, Colban, and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 16th) on the President Cleveland. Regarding the Far East situation, he only stated that "the Chinese war is something no one can predict," and declined to offer further criticism. Minister Colban will stay here for a few days before returning to his home country for a long vacation. Mr. Colban is quite concerned about the current state of trade between Norway and Japan. It is said that Japan imports more Norwegian products than it exports. Norway's exports to Japan are mainly wood pulp. Mr. Colban clearly stated that his visit to Shanghai had no purpose, and he only wanted to meet with private friends before returning home. The affairs of the Norwegian Embassy in China are being handled very well by the Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai. According to reports, Mr. Colban had previously decided to come to Shanghai to take office in January of this year, and is now scheduled to travel to Europe on the Xianghuosituo on August 21st.

### Fractional Currency Notes Printed and Delivered; To Be Issued in the Near Future; Notes Belong to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank; May Be in Circulation Within the Next Week

After the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, ordering the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank to issue one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday from the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank that the first batch of 500,000 yuan, including 300,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan in five-cent notes, has been printed and delivered in full since the printing contract was signed with the Wing Ning Company of Hong Kong. The notes belong to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank for regular issuance. The issuance date and procedures are still to be determined by the bank, but it is likely to be within the next week. As for the design, the front has the words "Central Bank of the Republic of China Year 28" and a pagoda, marked as one cent or five cents. The back has an ancient coin marked as one cent or five cents. It is said that the fractional currency notes are fully backed by legal tender. After the issuance, the substitute coupons issued by various companies and firms should be withdrawn uniformly.

### Shipping Companies Establish a Transfer Bureau in Zhenhai

After the Ningbo Defense Commander specially approved the resumption of navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo, because the gap in the Zhenhai blockade line has been blocked, ships such as the De Ping, Si De, Mou Fu, Hana, and Yingzhou, which operate between Shanghai and Ningbo, have all changed their mooring to Qiliyu outside the Zhenhai Estuary. Goods and passengers are all transported by barges. Shipping companies and Ningbo authorities are very concerned about the safety of the barges.

### After the Opening of the Black Market for Cotton Yarn, National Yarn Transactions are Active; Demand Exceeds Supply, Prices Increased Yesterday; No One Consults the Japanese Exchange

The cotton yarn black market transaction, after yesterday's announcement limited to three major principles for careful trading, immediately secretly instructed market supervisors to strictly implement it, and decided that anyone who had a few unstable customers should be eliminated. This aroused the enthusiasm of the market, and everyone unanimously turned to the national yarn. The mutual need was very strong. Unfortunately, there was a limited amount of spot goods, which eventually led to a situation where demand exceeded supply, and the price of national yarn also rose. The prices of various yarns from various factories all rose yesterday. As for the general transactions in the market, they were thoroughly national spot yarn, and there were

Foreign Yarn Transactions

Occasionally, a few transactions were completed in secret, but they were all secretly negotiated outside the market or in tea parties, which was beyond the control of the black market authorities. The method of changing new certificates for black market members is purely a necessary measure. Although speculators may sneak in afterwards, their bad tricks will be difficult to use, because a new transaction method has been set, which can

Reveal at Any Time

Its mistakes. According to the Daguan News Agency reporter, who learned from relevant parties, the cotton yarn exchange that the Japanese have been actively preparing to organize recently was originally intended to attract legitimate merchants into their trap, but because the manufacturers are well aware of the righteousness, they generally

Refuse to Cooperate

The rumors that some Chinese have joined the exchange as brokers are all fictitious. Although the location has been decided in the former Gold Exchange on Jiujiang Road, it is still a castle in the air. According to general observations, the exchange will definitely not be realized. The main reasons are: (1) The yarn factories in various parts of Japan have

Too Many Soldiers

On the Service, and the Productivity Has Been Reduced by 60% to 70%; (2) The Products of the Japanese Yarn Factories in Shanghai are Used to Control the Sales Channels in the Occupied Areas, and Have Been Directly Transported to Various Places by the Japanese Factories, and the Local Sales Volume Has Been Greatly Reduced; (3) After the War, the Sales of Japanese Yarn in China, Because the Chinese People in Various Places Have Already Made the Determination to Sever Economic Relations with Japan, and No One Will Use Japanese Yarn. Although Some Small Cloth Factories in Shanghai Had Previously Decided to Use It, the Sales of Japanese Yarn Have Also Been Affected Since National Yarn Has Been Selling Well.

### The Inside Story of the Violent Assault Case in Zhaofeng Garden the Night Before Last is Complex; The Victim's Employer Lost a Handgun and Bullets; The Two Perpetrators are Highly Suspected

At around 9:30 PM the night before last, four men suddenly violently assaulted another man named Qin Houxing next to the Zhaofeng Garden Zoo at the end of Yuyuan Road, and at the same time, they wrapped a rope around Qin's neck, intending to strangle him. Fortunately, Qin shouted loudly for help, causing several British Indian troops stationed next to Zhaofeng Garden to immediately cross the bamboo fence to the scene.

Qin was Rescued

At the same time, Zhou Wenqing from Changzhou and Zhang Xiaoer from Shanghai (both 18 years old) who were committing the crime at the scene were arrested and reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Chinese detective Xie Futang rushed to investigate and brought Zhou and Zhang to the police station. Although Qin Houqing suffered injuries to his nose and face, they were not serious, so he was discharged from the hospital after being bandaged by Tongren Hospital. According to Qin Hou and the police station, he was working as a servant for an Englishman named Wei Shudeng at No. 621 Xiafei Road. At 3:00 PM on the 16th, two friends, Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen,

Came to Linger

For a long time, and then invited him to visit Zhaofeng Park together, so he went with them. In the park, he met Zhou Wenqing and Zhang Xiaoer again. Unexpectedly, while playing until about 9:00 PM, Chen took out a rope and wrapped it around my neck. At the same time, Zhou and the other three punched me, seemingly wanting to kill me, but the reason is unknown. Zhou Wenqing and Zhang Xiaoer claimed that Chen Guoyuan and Qin Lixing were all friends. Yesterday, Chen ordered them to beat Qin. It is learned that Chen once introduced a woman named Jin Bao

To Qin for Intimacy

But I don't know why the two had a dispute over this matter, which evolved into what happened a moment ago. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Zhou and Zhang to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted for injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Law, and stated that although the defendants claimed that the cause was due to the woman Jin Bao, the fact is difficult to believe. This morning, the police station received a report from Qin Houxing's employer, stating that his

Three Handguns

And one hundred bullets were suddenly stolen on the 16th, and Chen Guoyuan and Zhang Xiaoer, who were at large on that day, had been at the Westerner's house for a long time, so the cause of this case is definitely not so simple. The police station still needs to conduct a thorough investigation, so please postpone the hearing of this case. After Judge Meng Tingke questioned Qin Houxing and the two defendants, he ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for another week.

### Young Woman Applies for Divorce Mediation; And Demands 10,000 Yuan in Alimony

A man named Wang Yiche, currently residing at No. 6, Tingyuanfang, Lane 281, Fuli Road, married Yan Shaolin, a woman from Jiading (26 years old this year), eight years ago. The relationship between the two was initially quite harmonious, but in recent years it has become like ice and charcoal. Yan recently filed a petition with the Civil Mediation Court of the Second Special Court, applying for divorce mediation and demanding 10,000 yuan in alimony, as well as the return of a gold ring, diamond ring, gold watch, and rhinestone ring, as well as a pair of pearl bracelets and a real stone. The reason is that the opposing party, Wang Yiche, wrote a letter of repentance on January 30th of this year, promising to quit bad habits and break away from mistresses, etc., but has not fulfilled these conditions and has often abused the petitioner, so she has no choice but to demand a divorce. According to the court, the case was mediated yesterday in the Fourth Civil Court by Judge Yang. The opposing party, Wang Yiche, did not arrive. After reviewing the case, the court recognized that the mediation was unsuccessful and could be filed separately.

Another Film Was Taken, and at 4:30 PM, the Two Doctors Asked to Cut a Piece of Flesh from the Mother to Repair the Infant's Wound. At About 8:00 PM that Night, the Child Died.

The first autumn high tide of the Huangpu River, which began on the 15th, reached its peak yesterday morning, as the tide suddenly surged ashore. The Datong News Agency reporter recorded the following:

Yesterday Morning's High Tide

Yesterday morning's high tide, which began around 1:30 AM, exceeded the Shanghai Dredging Bureau's forecast by thirteen feet, one and five-tenths of an inch.

A Datong News Agency reporter, while passing North Suzhou Road yesterday morning, personally witnessed the China Industrial Bank's godown, the China Trust Company's warehouse, and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank's warehouse all having their steps submerged by the tide. The Zhejiang Industrial Bank's warehouse was still clearing water that had entered within the threshold.

Rapid Huangpu River Current

At the height of the high tide, the current of the Huangpu River reached a speed of 2.4 knots, making it quite difficult for sailboats to navigate. Moreover, some civilian boats struck the riverbank and were pushed onto the shore, creating a peculiar sight.

### "Anti-Smoking Bureau Chief" Zhu Yao Exposed for Embezzling Public Funds

Zhu Yao, the current Acting Director of the bogus "Central China Anti-Smoking Bureau," was able to secure this position with the support of Chen Zemin, the bogus "Governor of Jiangwu Province." From the moment he took office, he traveled to various locations to announce his "anti-smoking policy," but in reality, he engaged in excessive taxation and extensive plundering. As a result, land prices in various counties of Central China skyrocketed. In July alone, the bureau's unexpected income from price increases exceeded one million yuan. After a small portion was used to cover official expenses, the remainder went into Zhu's private pocket. It is now known that this secret has been discovered by a certain party.

It is now known that the "Court" recently received instructions from the "Provisional Judicial Department" to "increase revenue." It is now actively planning to expand its scope to increase income.

The "Chief Prosecutor" will be Qiu Zhun. The area under its jurisdiction will be limited to the area of the extra-settlement roads in western Shanghai, from Yinghua Lane on Route Robert to the Shanghai-Xujiahui Railway in the south, and from Route Conty and Yanping Road (including Route Bubbling Well) in the east to the Shanghai-Songhu Railway in the west.

### The Truth About the Intense Gunfire in Western Shanghai: Large Gang of Bandits Robs Cloth Factory; Over Ten Bandits Arrested, One Bogus Policeman Injured

Around 1:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 16th), a large-scale robbery occurred in Yaojiajiao, Route Brennan, in western Shanghai. It has been learned that the Shenyuan Cloth Factory, located at 14, has been operating for many years. On the morning in question, a large gang of over thirty bandits, each armed with box cannons, pistols, and knives and sticks, swarmed around the factory and scaled the walls to enter. Four bandits were left to keep watch. After entering, the remaining bandits took control of the people inside the factory and openly carried out 300 bundles of yarn, one spindle, two yarn files, and other items, loading them onto parked vehicles. Afterwards, the bandits escaped with their loot towards Panjiaku. At the time, the Japanese side and the "Great Way Police" received the news and rushed to the scene. They encountered each other near Xiaoshiqiao. The bandits preemptively opened fire, and the two sides engaged in a fierce battle, exchanging over two or three hundred shots. After fifteen minutes of intense fighting, the bandits were overwhelmed and scattered. One bandit, Chen Weigong, was captured on the spot, and several vehicles of stolen goods were also seized.

At the time, nearby residents were unaware of the situation and, upon hearing the intense gunfire, were greatly alarmed.

### Owner of Minghe Yarn Factory Accused of Embezzlement, Continued Hearing; Plaintiff Claims $40,000 in Silver Yarn; Defendant Claims War Impact, Not Fraud; Debate Ends, Court Orders Defendant to Post Bail Pending Judgment

Wang Zuolin, residing at 3 Xiangyu Lane, 3 Tianzhu Tang Street, is a shareholder of the Great Shanghai Hotel and also operates a paint company. Because he previously opened the Minghe Yarn Factory in Beixinjing and failed to deliver goods for issued warehouse receipts and orders, he was recently sued by Hakka Liang Yong'ao, represented by lawyers Zhu Gaorong and others, in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for embezzlement and fraud, with an attached civil lawsuit requesting a judgment ordering the return of the deposit and compensation for losses, amounting to approximately $40,000.

The case was previously heard by Judge Miao Qingbang, who ordered the defendant Wang Zuolin to post bail of $8,000 pending further hearing. Yesterday afternoon, around 3:00 PM, Judge Miao held a special hearing in the case. The plaintiff and defendant, both accompanied by lawyers, were present to await the hearing. The plaintiff, Liang Yong'ao, stated that in the summer of the previous year, under the name of Yunhua Yarn Company, he purchased 29 bales of Blue Sky Horse brand six-count yarn from the Minghe Yarn Factory owned by the defendant Wang Zuolin and paid the price. The yarn was stored in the Minghe Factory, with warehouse receipts as proof. He also ordered 250 bales of Tianma brand yarn from the Minghe Factory under the name of Xinfeng Yarn Company and paid a deposit of $980, but the goods were never delivered. Therefore, the plaintiff's 29 bales of yarn were embezzled, valued at $8,700, and the deposit of $980 was defrauded. The losses suffered by the plaintiff due to the defendant's embezzlement and fraud amounted to $31,250. Therefore, he requested that the court not only punish the defendant for the crime he deserves, but also order the defendant to return the deposit and other fees, amounting to approximately $40,000. Then the defendant Wang Zuolin testified that the 29 bales of yarn sold to the plaintiff had already been delivered to Xue Jinmeng, a shareholder of Yunhua Yarn Company, and that the plaintiff was not a shareholder of Yunhua Yarn Company and had no right to file a lawsuit. As for the order from Xinfeng Yarn Company, the defendant did not intentionally fail to deliver the goods, but rather because the factory was in Beixinjing and suffered significant losses due to the Shanghai war. The defendant had no intention of fraud and requested that he be acquitted. The plaintiff's attached civil claim should also be dismissed. Furthermore, the plaintiff has committed false accusations and requested that he be punished according to the law. The court, noting that both parties held differing views, questioned witnesses You Xiansheng and Zhang Deqing and determined that the facts were clear. The court ordered the start of the debate, with lawyer Wu Peng representing the defendant providing a detailed defense.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Sir, According to the party concerned, Jiang Zhongji, a news item titled "Jiang Zhongji Construction Factory Owner Ignores Mortgage" was published in the Shanghai News of this newspaper on the 16th of this month. After investigation, the content is inconsistent with the facts, and the story is exaggerated, with apparent ulterior motives. After investigation, the mortgage was transferred from Anji's account, but in order to enhance credit in the middle, the property certificate was used as collateral. However, for this mortgage, the creditor was notified in advance to prepare funds for liquidation before the due date. The dispute between the two parties is not about the issue of deferred remittance versus cash. There is absolutely no situation of delay or ignorance. It is inappropriate for the creditor to suddenly interfere with the court. At that time, no newspaper reporters were present to record the proceedings, but the newspaper suddenly had this record, which was obviously being used by someone. Please issue a letter requesting correction to avoid confusion. Yours sincerely, Zhu Yisheng, Attorney at Law, to the Editor of Shen Bao.

### Whether Public and Private Elementary School Principals Not Teaching Classes Should Be Exempt from Military Service; Zhejiang Department of Education Should Issue Instructions for Interpretation

(Lishui Correspondence) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, according to the presentations from public and private elementary school principals throughout the province, seeks instructions on whether public and private elementary school principals not teaching classes should be exempt from military service. The Department of Education specifically explains that according to Article 13 of the Elementary School Law, elementary school principals should also teach classes. Schools with a larger number of grades may have full-time principals, who should also teach classes as appropriate. Township- and village-run elementary schools may, out of practical necessity, have principals who do not teach classes, but these principals should be limited to those township or village heads who possess the qualifications for principal as stipulated. Township and village heads are all eligible for military service deferment, so no issues arise. For private elementary schools, matters concerning fundraising and all financial matters should be handled by the board of directors. The position of principal should be filled by the board of directors appointing a teacher to serve concurrently. Separate principals who do not teach classes should not be appointed. Previously, according to the reports from various county governments, private elementary school boards of directors were instructed to have the chairman serve concurrently as principal. This order should be strictly followed. This instruction is issued for compliance and implementation.

### Current Situation of Shaoxing High School, Zhejiang Province

(Shaoxing News) Shaoxing High School, Zhejiang Province, is located in Shaoxing, the foremost front line of the eastern theater. The school has been in a precarious position since the fall of western Zhejiang. After the fall of Hangzhou, there was a proposal to relocate. Afterwards, as the situation gradually stabilized, Principal Jin Xiang and the majority of the faculty believed that the school would suffer significant losses in terms of spirit and material if it were to relocate. Therefore, they decided to continue classes as usual at the original Cangqiao address within the city, without interruption. However, to guard against unforeseen circumstances, a temporary school site was selected in a rural area eighty miles from the city, as a place to relocate if necessary. Last semester, the school had over 600 students, an increase compared to before the war. During this year's enrollment, the number of applicants exceeded the number of admissions by more than ten times, an unprecedented record that was beyond expectation. To intensify the training of students to meet the needs of wartime, the school specially organized a Wartime Education Design Committee to formulate a Wartime Education Implementation Plan, divided into three types: physical training, productive labor training, and wartime rear service training. Physical training includes ball games, martial arts, swimming, bicycles, equestrianism, mountain climbing, and cross-country running. Productive labor training includes chemical crafts, weaving, and agronomy. Wartime rear service training includes military engineering, nursing and first aid, intelligence, propaganda through drama and opera, and singing. It is stipulated that each person must select four hours of study per week for each type, totaling twelve hours. Furthermore, the school, recognizing the low level of knowledge among the public and the difficulty of promoting national salvation efforts, established a large-scale Wartime Public School within the school. The school requested the county government to instruct the three towns of the city center, west, and north to send students to the school. All out-of-school members of the public in the towns must be forced to enroll in phases. The first phase, with 250 people, has already reached its quota and has begun classes.

### Finance Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Remain Severe Initial Sharp Tightening Followed by Slight Rebound

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices were announced with no changes. Although the dark market for British and American currencies initially favored a certain party's absorption, some American banks were still willing to sell, resulting in only a slight softening of the situation. After 10:30, due to continued favorable absorption, Sassoon and other foreign firms also came to buy and close positions. In addition, HSBC came to buy, so although Hong Kong Electric and some American banks successively released, the supply still felt insufficient to meet the demand, so the situation gradually tightened. At one point, the British gold was the tightest, once exceeding 3 pence 34375. The American exchange rate also once called for 6 and a half yuan. However, although Hong Kong Electric stopped selling at noon and switched to buying, foreign banks were still willing to sell, so it was not affected. In the afternoon, Sassoon suddenly came to give back, so the situation became more stable. As a result, the British gold closed at 3 pence 40625 and the American exchange rate closed at 6 yuan 625. The 8 and 9-month futures also followed the same steps, with the British gold tightening by 09375 and the American gold softening by 1875, but the 8 and 9-month swap spread remained the same as the previous day. The overall transaction was mediocre.

Favorable Buyers Quite Active

At the beginning of the morning, London's large strips, both near and far, shrank back by 25. New York's silver price suddenly rebounded slightly. London's raw gold remained unchanged. In terms of exchange rates, the British pound was flat against the US dollar, the French franc, and the Shanghai currency. The US dollar was still flat against the British pound, down 2 jiao against the Shanghai currency, and down 125 against the French franc. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 3 and a half pence for British gold and 6 yuan 8125 for the American exchange rate, with no changes compared to the previous close. After opening, some American banks initially sold spot British gold at 3 and a half pence to other banks. Then Datong sold spot American exchange at 6 yuan 75 to favorable parties, which was slightly softer. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no ups and downs, and the silver balance tax was still exempted. After that, the market situation was still flat. Around 11:00, because favorable parties continued to absorb for a certain party, Sassoon and foreign firms also came to buy slightly. Although Hong Kong Electric had come to throw out, foreign banks were reluctant to sell, causing the market to continue to soften. It is estimated that favorable parties, foreign firms, and Sassoon absorbed spot British gold at 3 and a half pence to 4375 from Hong Kong Electric and some American banks, and spot American exchange at 6 yuan 6875. Then Sassoon also bought British gold for the current month at 3 pence 375 from foreign banks. Later, HSBC closed spot British gold at 3 pence 375 with other banks. At that time, some American banks also suddenly absorbed spot American exchange at 6 yuan 625 from Chinese merchants. After that, the British gold was the softest, calling for 3 pence 34375, and the American exchange rate was the tightest, calling for 6 and a half yuan. Near noon, although Hong Kong Electric stopped selling and switched to buying, foreign banks were still willing to sell, so the situation gradually flattened. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric closed spot British gold at 3 pence 375 and spot American exchange at 6 yuan 5625 with foreign banks. By noon close, the bank's spot selling prices were 3 pence 375 for British gold and 6 yuan 5625 for American exchange.

Sassoon Gives Back in the Afternoon

The afternoon market was quite flat and trading was sluggish. However, Sassoon came to sell slightly, so the situation rebounded slightly. It is estimated that Sassoon sold spot British gold at 3 pence 40625 and spot American exchange at 6 yuan 625 to foreign banks. By the evening close, the bank's spot selling prices were 3 pence 40625 for British gold and 6 yuan 625 for American exchange. British gold for the current month was 3 pence 34375 and American exchange was 6 and a half yuan. British gold for September was 2 pence 96875 and American exchange was 5 yuan 75. As a result, compared to the previous day's noon close, the current period British gold tightened by 09375 and the American gold softened by 1875.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises Again

Hong Kong, 17th The opening was stable today. The British, American, and Japanese exchange rates remained unchanged. The Shanghai exchange rate fell slightly by 1 yuan to 413 yuan. At 10:40, the Shanghai exchange rate rose by 4 yuan to 417 yuan. At 12:30, it rose again by 11 yuan to 428 yuan. There was no change at 2:30 pm.

### Many Hidden Reefs in the European Situation Cash Surge Slightly Frustrated Calculate at 600-700 Yuan Based on Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's cash 'cooked red' dark market situation was slightly mediocre, but the trend was still erratic. It generally fell first, then rose, and then fell back, all based on the foreign exchange trend as the target. Initially, it inherited the fatigue from the evening of the previous day, and the foreign exchange was very flat at that time, so the morning opening fell to a low of 4,480 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange reported tightening, causing a buying spree. Some gold shops, on behalf of speculators, and some banks, on behalf of foreign banks, successively made aggressive advances. However, there were quite a few retail investors coming out, and silver shops and cash shops all had hedging sales, so although the price soared to a peak of 4,640 yuan, there were quite a few twists and turns along the way. Later, because the foreign exchange slightly rebounded, there was a gradual lack of buyers, and it plunged straight to 4,565 yuan. The closing result only rose by 15 yuan compared to the previous day, so the gold price calculated based on foreign exchange became more and more divorced (British gold was 5,204 yuan 7 jiao, and American exchange was 5,285 yuan 3 jiao), actually pressing down by 640 to 720 yuan. According to inquiries, there are three reasons: (1) There are still many hidden reefs in the European situation; (2) The exchange rate discount is still high; (3) And recently, the exchange market interest rate has reached a monthly interest of 1 jiao. However, this arbitrage is very risky, so there are many wealthy merchants in this city who abandon this and turn to that, which has hindered the surge in gold prices. The total transaction was about 1,000 taels. The result of silver shop jewelry gold was neither good nor bad. The customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

'Cooked Red' Rises 15 Yuan

Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels), because the foreign exchange was still flat and people were still tired, the opening was similar to the late closing of the previous day, and the official price was 70 yuan lower than the previous close. A silver shop sold 20 taels to a money exchange shop, priced at 4,480 yuan. After opening, because it was heard that the foreign exchange was slightly softer, there were more buyers, and the market situation suddenly turned strong and expensive, hovering near the 4,500 yuan mark. At about 9:50, the situation became stronger because the money exchange shop's buying intention suddenly became stronger, rising by 60 yuan. A securities shop sold 30 taels to a money exchange shop, priced at 1,560 yuan. At that time, some gold shops and silver shops competed to sell, and the price fell back down. Soon, it was pressed down by a small 45 yuan. The money exchange shop sold 50 taels to a silver shop, priced at 4,515 yuan. At about 10:00, it was heard that the foreign exchange was quite prosperous, so the situation was gradually softening, causing the gold market buyers to also come one after another. Sellers did not come forward, and it jumped straight up. Before long, it soared by 85 yuan. A silver shop traded 30 taels with each other, priced at 4,600 yuan. At that time, it once again pressed down to 4,585 yuan. At 10:50, it was heard that the foreign exchange central bank HSBC also had an appetite, so the black market exchange rate was tighter. Securities shops and others also had strong buying intentions, and it rose again by 25 yuan. The money exchange shop traded 20 taels with each other, priced at 4,610 yuan. Near noon, the foreign exchange turned flat, people's hearts were slightly frustrated, and buyers were watching, immediately returning within the 4,600 yuan mark. The money exchange shop sold 10 taels to some gold shop, priced at 4,580 yuan as the noon closing price. In the early afternoon, the trend was even stronger. The opening was 10 yuan higher. Some broker entered 20 taels for the money exchange shop, priced at 4,590 yuan. Later, a foreign bank came to entrust some bank to make an aggressive advance of more than 100 taels, causing the price to soar again by 50 yuan. Some bank entered 20 taels for the gold shop, priced at 4,640 yuan as the peak of the day. Later, because the foreign exchange was slightly harder, money exchange shops and silver shops all took advantage of the high price to sell, and the price plunged by 75 yuan. The money exchange shop sold 10 taels to a gold shop, priced at 4,565 yuan. The closing price last night resulted in an increase of 15 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been rising for four consecutive days, a total increase of 245 yuan. It was heard that it had risen again to 5,585 yuan after the close. The whole day fluctuated by 160 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the cooked red, and the current standard gold was 65 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few openings.

Jewelry Gold Results in a Draw

Silver shop jewelry gold, per tael, initially Daxiang Bank still hung at 460 yuan. At 9:40, it was lowered by 5 yuan. More than 10 minutes later, it went back up by 5 yuan. At 3:40 pm, it was lowered again by 5 yuan. After that, there were no changes. As a result, there were no ups and downs. Daxiang Bank still hung at the original price of 460 yuan, and Xinxing Bank was at 458 yuan. The closing was reduced by 20 yuan. In addition, the selling price of pure silver per tael at Daxiang Bank suddenly hung up by 3 jiao, estimated to be 3 yuan 5 jiao.

Pure Gold Remained Unchanged Yesterday

London, 16th The British pure gold remained at 7 pounds 8 shillings and 7 pence per ounce, so the market prices of the central banks were the same as the previous day.

### Discount Rises Again Opens at 200 Yuan

Yesterday's exchange rate discount rate suddenly soared. In the morning, it gradually rose to 190 yuan per 1,000 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the demand for cash bills was still strong, rising again by 10 yuan, finally reaching the 200 yuan mark, 20 yuan higher than the previous day. The money industry association's borrowing interest rate remained unchanged, opening at 1 jiao 8 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Exchange Rate of British and American Gold Certificates Requires High Interest

Yesterday's foreign currency market experienced significant fluctuations due to the change in the exchange rate, ultimately resulting in closing prices similar to the previous day. Consequently, the British and American gold pounds initially strengthened but later weakened, resulting in an unstable outcome. However, the exchange rate of British and American gold certificates slightly softened, with high interest required. As a result, they rose significantly. Due to the demand from the industrial and commercial sectors to travel to the southwest, Hong Kong and French Indochina francs were in short supply, leading to firm market conditions. Singaporean certificates were slightly expensive due to travel needs. Japanese gold certificates were in high demand, rising considerably, reaching one yuan and eighteen fen in the evening market. Korean certificates were in scarce supply, also rising sharply, reaching ninety-nine fen in the evening market. Other currencies experienced stable market conditions due to insignificant supply and demand. Trading at the Exchange was sparse, with only Sen Tai selling 300 yuan of Hong Kong certificates to Xiang Kang. Yesterday's market prices showed British gold certificates rising by one yuan and five jiao, American gold certificates by three jiao, Hong Kong certificates by eight fen, French franc certificates by one fen, Singaporean certificates by one jiao and five fen, and French Indochina certificates by two jiao and five fen. Other currencies remained unchanged.

### Sudden Small Reversal of American Silver, British and Indian Silver Also Decline

London, 16th - The silver market saw selling from India and speculative trading, leading to a generally weak market. After closing, there were some transactions at the listed price. Large bars of silver for both near and far terms retracted by 0.25. New York silver reported a sudden small retraction of 0.5 fen in spot prices. Bombay silver reported a weakening silver market, with spot and August prices both declining by eleven annas, and September declining by eighteen annas. Only fifty contracts were traded, it was reported.

### Food - Rice Prices Surge by Three Yuan - Using Shallow Reserves as Propaganda - Shaking the Hearts of Those in Apprehension

The most cunning rice merchants are still employing media tactics, even using their reserves of just over 70,000 bags as propaganda to unsettle the people. In reality, this self-reported reserve number should not be treated as Shanghai's entire stockpile. Everyone knows it isn't. This newspaper has repeatedly exposed their deception. Even if the rice merchants' investigation is accurate, this mere 70,000+ bags of rice is only enough to feed Shanghai's five million residents for three days (according to their claim, this reserve level was valid up to August 14th). Is this really the case? Therefore, yesterday's evening newspapers unanimously criticized this behavior. However, rice merchants are heartlessly exploiting the news to drive up Shanghai rice prices by around three yuan, adding an extra burden on the people's staple food, which is exactly what is being called "toxic news" these days. No wonder rice merchants are singing its praises.

How much rice does Shanghai actually have in reserve? The best solution to this question is for the Public Works Department to investigate thoroughly. At this time, it's not just about price controls, but about paying attention to the entire rice market and conducting a systematic review, so that the rice merchants can no longer smirk and think they are untouchable. Only then will the people of the city be fortunate.

The shipment of Ke Xian rice to Shanghai has been in the works for a long time. A certain individual in the grain business is in charge, and a certain bank known for its economic cooperation is a partner. Therefore, when rice prices rise, the hoarders should certainly be held responsible, but the financial sector also indirectly and directly contributes to this. Those in the rice business have always regretted hoarding too little and making too little money. Their greed is truly lamentable. However, small rice shops are indeed facing difficulties, while large factories and corporations are making great fortunes.

Yesterday's under-the-table rice market was reportedly even more rampant, with prices being pushed up aggressively, completely disregarding local public order and the people's difficult situation. It was even said that premium high-grade glutinous rice (Gao Xi Geng) was at 32 yuan, market-grade at 31 yuan, and medium-grade at 30 yuan; Su Tong Kun glutinous rice at 31 yuan to 30 yuan; Changzhou fresh glutinous rice at 32 yuan; He Xia early and late rice at 28 yuan to 29 yuan; Pudong new glutinous rice (30 dan) at 29 yuan; premium Wu pointed rice at 27 yuan, ultimately at 26 yuan; ordinary pointed rice at 23.5 yuan to 24 yuan; and "change yuan" rice at 30 yuan. Total transaction volume was estimated to be no less than 13,000+ bags.

Ke Xian rice was in high demand yesterday, with internal and external hoarders and hawkers taking the opportunity to raise prices. Jing Wu Xian rice rose sharply, with prices reaching 28 yuan, a rise of 3 yuan compared to the previous market. The market chaos was unprecedented. Although the source has not been officially released, Japanese-Chinese merchants are working hard to transport it. In addition to a small number transported by trucks, it is rumored that Japanese ships such as the "Chikugo Maru" have loaded 6-7,000 bags, which were unloaded at warehouses in Hongkou.

Yesterday morning, foreign New Saigon rice opened at 33.5 yuan, then rose by another two yuan to 35.5 yuan. However, it is rumored that a certain party has finalized an agreement to ship 10,000 tons to Shanghai for sale at a stable price, and 17,000 bags are being loaded within the next few days, with the intention of selling them at a flat rate once they arrive in port within this month. According to investigations by this newspaper, recently ships have been going directly to Saigon to load rice, but it is being transported to India for unloading.

### Flour Street Sales Surge - Wheat Supply Uninterrupted

Flour remains at six yuan per original disc (yuanpan), because since rice prices soared, residents have switched to eating flour, leading to a significant increase in street sales. Factories are aware that customer-side transactions are quiet and are now focusing on their own street-side retail, rejecting customer side demand. Therefore, customer side continues to buy back factory flour and foreign flour from the market. It is heard that the resale price is still six yuan and one jiao. 4610 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin on the 18th.

Wheat - The supply is uninterrupted, and sentiment is not as feverish as in the previous two days. Hoarders and factory owners claim to be working together, but are now emphasizing caution. However, with rice prices skyrocketing and the Hong Kong situation becoming tense, the future of grain is still favorable, so those holding goods are maintaining their positions, resulting in continued price increases. The Tongshi (Unified Market) was jointly operated by Fuxin and Fufeng factories for Beijing-Zhenjiang-Suzhou-Changzhou wheat, totaling 16-17 truckloads. Hoarders brought in 20 truckloads, with the highest price at 9.1 yuan, a rise of a jiao or so from the previous day.

### Oil Cakes - Hoarders Are the Culprits - Oil Prices Rise Without End

The oil market continues to move upwards, with the upward trend seeming endless. The general financial community and wealthy individuals are consistently adding more capital. Yesterday's peanut oil prices rose again by 2.5 yuan, and soybean oil prices increased by eight jiao to one yuan. 30 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded at a price of 68.5 yuan, 50 barrels of Kobe raw oil at 67 yuan, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at 39.6 yuan, 350 pieces of Yantai and Weihai soybean oil at 40.5 yuan, 100 pieces of Qingdao Weihai soybean oil at 40 yuan, 1000 cans of Tianjin canned soybean oil at 51.5 yuan and two jiao, 140 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at 54.8 yuan to 54 yuan, and 250 barrels of both Kobe and Dalian oil at 55.8 yuan to 55.5 yuan. Also, 860 bags of soybeans arrived from Beisha yesterday.

### Sugar Market - Coarse and Refined White Sugar See New High Prices

Yesterday's sugar market saw little change according to London reports, with recent prices down 0.25 and longer-term prices up 0.25 to 0.75. Exchange trading, influenced by exchange rates, continued to rise sharply. Spot market #24 coarse white sugar, initially at 39.5 yuan at one warehouse, later reached 40 yuan. At other warehouses, it rose from 39 yuan to 40 yuan. Re-export goods were at 31 yuan to 32 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar rose by a total of two yuan. Western Warehouse B-mark opened at 43.8 yuan, and Eastern Warehouse at 6 jiao, later rising to 44.4 yuan, with some quoting as high as 45 yuan. Residual goods were withdrawn. Local refined white sugar rose by two yuan. Zhenji #1 was at 40 yuan, and local #1 rock sugar also rose by two yuan to 44 yuan. Jingming rock sugar was at 46 yuan. Domestic sugar remained firm. Chaozhou's formal Huanggang Qing opened to 33.3 yuan, with over a hundred bags traded.

### Yarn and Cotton - Landings at Shenzhen - Yarn Sales Suddenly Hit - Prices Rise Then Fall

The yarn market has begun to weaken after a period of sustained firmness, showing a wavering trend. In reality, actual sales are lacking. The Japanese army suddenly invaded Shenzhen in Southern China, creating a tense atmosphere on the border between Hong Kong and Guangdong, which has further hit yarn sales. Today, Hong Kong dealers purchased only 110 bales, and other dealers also remained inactive. The market situation is very peaceful, with a narrow range of price fluctuations. However, some who expect prices to rise still refuse to give up, arguing that raw materials are expensive and factory costs have increased. However, prices have already reached a high level, and future changes are inevitable.

Spot yarn opened with nervous sentiment, and buyers continued to crowd in, with opening prices rising by five to six yuan. Shortly after, it was heard that exchange rates had weakened and gold had risen again, further fueling the buying frenzy and causing the market to rise by a few more yuan. The high price of 20-count Double Horse yarn from foreign warehouses has reached 760 yuan. However, as the Hong Kong dealers' buying intentions weakened, the situation reversed, and prices fell back by seven to eight yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn is 751 yuan. Factory list prices fell from 693 yuan to 687 yuan. The closing price was flat. It is estimated that the total transaction volume from all parties during the first half of the day was 630 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse spot yarn rose by two yuan, and Shepherd also rose by two yuan. Factory prices remained unchanged. 22 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai today. The amount of purchases by each dealer group is listed on the left:

Fellow traders: 345; Mainland: 110;
Hong Kong: 110; Yunnan: 50;
Xiamen: 15; Total: 630.

### Actual Situation of Yarn Sales

In recent days, the sales of 20-count Double Horse and Tejin Cheng brand cotton yarn have been particularly strong, and the selling prices have been particularly high. The reasons for this are briefly described below:

(1) Hong Kong dealers are buying as much of this yarn as possible because the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate in Shanghai is unusually high. They can still make a profit by selling and transporting the goods to Southeast Asia. This is how the yarn has developed.

(2) The yarns produced by Shenxin Textile Mill are the same. The price of Double Horse yarn from the No. 9 mill is high and cannot meet the demand. The price of Flying Maiden yarn from the No. 2 mill is low and there is no way to sell it. This yarn is sold exclusively in Fujian and Zhejiang. Since Chaoshan was lost, sales have been interrupted, and the market price has fallen, making the price of Double Horse yarn much higher, falling short by 60 or 70 yuan.

(3) The mainland's management is strict. 1100 yuan in Sichuan is worth 1000 yuan in Shanghai, which is equal to a 17% discount. According to a survey, the market price of 20-count fine yarn in Sichuan is only 1200-1300 yuan. Each bale of cotton yarn costs 200 yuan to transport to Chongqing, including water taxes, customs duties, insurance, and transportation costs. The current selling price of 20-count fine yarn in Shanghai is 750 yuan. Based on the above situation, yarns transported to the hinterland will not only fail to make a profit, but will also suffer losses.

### Concerns About Changes in Customs Gold Exchange Rate - Cotton Merchants Reluctant to Sell Cheaply

Spot trading of both Chinese and foreign cotton has disappeared because prices are already too high. Factories are in no hurry to buy. As for new factories, the price of yarn is more than 100 yuan cheaper than the price of yarn from older factories. At the current price of spot cotton, they are already losing money and have no need for raw cotton. The light trading volume is the biggest factor. It is said that 396 bales of Tonghua arrived from northern Jiangsu.

Another report states that the exchange rate in Shanghai's foreign cotton market tightened again yesterday. The statutory currency price per dan was increased by six to seven yuan. There are also rumors in the market that the customs gold exchange rate will be changed starting next month. Because of this, various colleagues deeply fear that the tax on future arrivals may increase by several times more than 5.75 yuan, so they are temporarily unwilling to sell. Factories' willingness to purchase has slightly changed, not as relaxed as before, so spot trading has been very brisk in recent days.

The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, has been sluggish in recent days. Yesterday, due to hedging sales in the south and sales in New Orleans, the market price was depressed throughout the day. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai also reported declines, arousing speculators in the market. As a result, the closing price fell by six to seven pounds compared to the previous day. Indian futures fell by more than one rupee, and Egyptian futures rose by more than ten pounds.

### Piece Goods - Hong Kong and Guangdong Cloth Sales Active - Domestic Cloth

Yesterday, spot sales to Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia dealers were very strong, and the market became firmer. There was strong sales volume of light-colored goods such as bleached cloth, bleached twill, floral cloth, hemp yarn, and foreign-spun cloth; and dark-colored goods such as blue cloth, colored twill, line flannel, serge, satin damask, and feather silk. Each piece rose frequently by one jiao to five jiao. Fine twill and coarse twill rose by one to two jiao. Fine cloth was flat. However, Ewo's 13-pound and 11-pound coarse cloth was slow-moving, and hoarders sold, with each piece falling by one to two jiao. Other grades remained stable. Guangdong and Hong Kong dealers purchased over 300 pieces of dark-colored goods and fine twill. Sichuan and Yunnan dealers purchased over 100 pieces. Siamese and Singaporean dealers mostly purchased light-colored cloth, totaling over 4,000 pieces. Ningbo dealers purchased over 50 pieces of coarse cloth serge and colored twill. Local dyeing factories had large demand and traded over 300 pieces of dyed fine twill, satin blank cloth, and velvet blank cloth. Wholesale stores bought small amounts, and retail business was also weak.

Eastern Piece Goods:

Yesterday, the selling prices of fine cloth and fine twill tightened due to buying by northern dealers. Each piece rose by 1.5 jiao to 2.5 jiao. Dealers from Tianjin and Qinhuangdao purchased over 700 pieces in total. Over 300 pieces were traded in this street. The spot price of Longtou fine cloth is 18.9 yuan, the futures price is 19.25 yuan, and the price for next month is 19.5 yuan. Japanese firms opened over 300 pieces of fine cloth, and it is heard that the price of Longtou for September is 19.5 yuan, and the spot price of Taizuru is 17.5 yuan. Serge, called "Gentleman Cloth," was also more expensive, and yesterday each yard also rose to 0.5425 yuan. 30 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai on the 18th.

### Securities - Domestic Debt Already Reaching Its Limits - Foreign Stocks Seem to Rise

The securities market remained sluggish yesterday, and trading became increasingly quiet. Both buyers and sellers were suspicious. The multi-party side was unwilling to add capital due to too many rumors, and the short side was also afraid to be bold because of the ever-changing manipulators on the floor. Slightly selling would lead to a decline, and the floor was only slightly hedging. United Union, United Benefit, and Zhen Kang sold, and only Hong Kang had some appetite for buying. Retail transactions were extremely rare. In short, public debt trading has reached its limits since the drastic changes in exchange rates and is no longer a concern for the financial community and large investors. Therefore, there is little hope at present. Yesterday's results fell by three jiao to one yuan. The total transaction volume was just over 200,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of Chinese Electric Company were traded at a price of 5.45 yuan.

The stock market of the General Chamber of Commerce was depressed due to news from Europe and politics. Prices fell at the opening, but soon sentiment improved, confidence gradually increased, and trading progressed rapidly. In the afternoon, as the new trading week began, prices rose further. Huideli shares were unusually active, with the price rising from 32.5 yuan at the opening to a peak of 36 yuan, because the public expects that the announcement of the final dividend for the previous period will be very good. Later, there was a slight pullback, stopping at 35 yuan. The good dividends announced by several rubber companies recently are tantamount to a prelude to the progress of each company's situation. Judging from the current upward trend of the Singapore dollar (one Singapore dollar is worth eight Chinese yuan), the distribution of dividends from each rubber company will be placed on a much larger foundation than before in the future. The public debt market continued to decline, and the transaction price of the electric power public debt was 73 yuan.

Furthermore, the commercial information column of this newspaper has been particularly detailed, which has long been noticed by readers. Recently, due to space constraints, not only have daily news reports been cut, but also reports on market conditions in the commercial information section that have not changed or have changed very little have been omitted, except when they are involved in the news. Also, such as the New York stock market, the report has been omitted due to necessity, except for the market price. When the space is expanded in the future, it will naturally be restored to its original state and enriched to meet the expectations of readers.

The Rubber Limited Company, managed by Huayitong Foreign Firm in this port, yesterday decided at a board meeting to pay an interim dividend of 5 jiao per share in national currency from August 30th for the year 1939. The Zhongxing Coal Mine Co., Ltd. in this port has been paying the 27th-year dividend from the 15th of this month at an annual rate of 3%.

London English Far East Companies' shares on 16th of this month (Wednesday) Listed Market Price: Shanghai Tramways share decreased by two shillings and six pence, price being twelve shillings and six pence, Kurak Lin Bang Rubber share decreased by 0.75 pence, price remains eighteen shillings and 0.75 pence, nothing else changed.

London Chinese Foreign Debts on 16th of this month (Wednesday) Listed Market Price: Stable again, all debts unchanged.

### Seafood - Hong Kong and Little Luzon - Strong Purchases of Golden Mountain Shrimp Tails

The previous market for Jinshan shrimp tails was sluggish, and although the exchange rate frequently contracted and expanded, the price increase was still flat. But recently, Hong Kong and Luzon have made major purchases, so it is now priced at 270 yuan, a sudden increase of 30 yuan. Over ten items of domestic products recently arrived at Yangjiao Gouwei, and were opened for sale yesterday at 179 yuan (exchange transfer).

### Market Summary

This lake lotus continued to be expensive. The supply of lotus seeds in the open lotus market is lacking, so this lake lotus has risen to 170 yuan, Raozhou lotus to 150 yuan, up another two or three yuan from before.

Sichuan fungus rises 30 yuan. Black fungus is highly priced due to high arrival cost, and it continues to rise. Yesterday it was heard that Sichuan fungus has opened to 325 yuan, a further increase of more than 30 yuan. The market price of Gao Zhuang brand postal fungus is 335 yuan, with a final price of 325 yuan, and the price of original package Sichuan fungus is 330 yuan.

New cicada slough have not arrived. New cicada slough typically arrive in mid-summer, but this year, they have not been shipped to Shanghai yet. This product is mostly produced in northern Jiangsu, and the goods in the occupied areas are mostly controlled by others, so they cannot be transported out. The products currently being sold in the market are all old goods, such as 60 yuan for clean cicada slough.

Indian coal涨风止息. Although Indian bituminous coal has risen onefold in price, the sales are actually frozen. Furthermore, there is new cargo arriving. These cargoes have had their prices pre-determined in shillings, and they have a relatively light cost. Because of this, the price上涨 trend has temporarily ceased. Colleagues have already taken off 5 yuan from the initial拆价 of 80 yuan per ton. Delivery from godowns in the Settlement requires additional transportation fee. Retail at shop front costs 1.05 yuan per basket.

### Should Husbands also Court Their Wives?

A husband who is a lustful beast cannot enjoy true happiness in life, even with his own wife. It is generally believed that before marriage, a man, in order to achieve his goal, can make any grand promise in front of her, can flatter his lover in every possible way, and seem to be sincere and pious. However, once they climb into the same bed, achieve marital bliss, and confirm their status as husband and wife, then the wife must sincerely and piously court her husband. To say that the husband must constantly court his wife would easily cause laughter. In fact, the relationship between husband and wife should not be determined by one act of love and winning her favor, but rather, every time before husband and wife engage in marital bliss, the husband should court her.

Animals are not as foolish as humans. Every time a beast mates with a female, it must first engage in a species-specific form of courtship, such as attacking other males to show his strength and stimulate her, or vibrating beautiful feathers and warbling songs to arouse her. We must never forget that every act of marital bliss between husband and wife is equal to a wedding. The husband's courtship is indispensable. Because when a woman is physiologically prepared, it is not only for the sake of avoiding her pain, but also for the benefit of the man. It not only increases emotional pleasure, but also has great benefits for the health of both husband and wife!

However, if a husband wants to achieve this goal, he must have healthy sexual function, so that he can self-control and also stimulate his wife to reach a state of harmony and pleasure. Therefore, affectionate love forms a happy family and gives birth to clever children. This is so meaningful and happy! However, if a man has committed self-pollution or nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been dissolute and indulged in lust after marriage, and has consumed too much of the reproductive gland fluid that controls sexual health, then kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, neurasthenia, and infertility will be endless. Such a husband, not to mention that he cannot automatically court his wife, I am afraid that when his wife really courts him, it will be difficult to cope with, so he cannot enjoy the favor of a beautiful woman. This is not only boring for the husband himself, but how can the wife not be heartbroken? From this, tragedies such as elopement, suicide, separation, and divorce in the family are innumerable! However, the above-mentioned symptoms are not incurable. Since the success of reproductive gland supplementation therapy, there is no need to worry! If patients can actively take the reproductive gland element preparation "Reproductin," they can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, and nourish the nerves on the first day and night after taking it. Regular taking can also help development and adjust metabolism. Not only can it cure various diseases in a short period of time, but it can also achieve the effect of prolonging life and reversing aging. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hemitol's Semen Consolidating Tablets" to stop emission and achieve rapid results!

Patient Zhao Qianli, a native of Zhejiang, is 30 years old. He has been infertile for five years after marriage and has symptoms such as premature ejaculation and impotence, and occasionally has nocturnal emission. He consulted me last month, so I asked him to purchase "Reproductin" and "Hemitol's Semen Consolidating Tablets" from Yong'an Pharmacy and take them together. As a result, after continuous use for a month, he has now recovered his complete health.

### Treatment of Nocturnal Emission in Early Autumn - Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Although it is already autumn, the summer heat has not dissipated. As the saying goes, "Heatstroke! Heatstroke!" The summer heat is not good for the brain. A person suffering from brain weakness due to nocturnal emission will definitely have poor memory, drowsy thoughts, and often have insomnia and swelling pain... His pain is difficult for others to understand! Why do people suffering from nocturnal emission suffer from brain weakness? Because the chemical components in our semen are mostly phosphorus and calcium, which are the main raw materials for the brain, kidneys, and nerves. Moreover, semen is physiologically what is called reproductive gland fluid, in which the pituitary gland comes directly from the brain, so those with nocturnal emission that leads to semen depletion will suffer from brain weakness, kidney deficiency, neurasthenia, etc. Brain weakness is most difficult to bear in hot weather, and kidney deficiency is most painful after the weather cools!

Why is there nocturnal emission? In addition to physiological spermatic overflow, it is mostly caused by self-abuse during the onset of spring, or early marriage and excessive sorrow, which injures the sexual nerves. Therefore, the seminal gates cannot be tightly controlled. Initially, emission is occasionally caused by dream stimulation, then every dream leads to emission, or emission occurs without dreams, or even during the day. At that time, the seminal gates have almost completely lost control. Under such circumstances, how can the semen not be depleted, so symptoms such as brain weakness and kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation and impotence, incomplete development, and scattered energy will follow one after another. Not only will it hinder the future of young people, but it will also lose the happiness that life should enjoy!

Treatment of nocturnal emission in early autumn is actually a better time. At this time, the weather is not too hot. You can pay attention to exercise, frequently wash the local area with cold water, read fewer erotic books and paintings, which is very helpful for purifying the mind and reducing desires, and abstain from self-abuse. At the same time, take "Hemitol's Semen Consolidating Tablets," a special medicine for treating emission that is praised by famous doctors at home and abroad. This will consolidate the seminal gates and can achieve the miraculous effect of promoting sleep and stopping emission that night. If there are already symptoms of brain weakness and kidney deficiency, you must also take the reproductive gland element preparation "Reproductin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and promote development. Continuous use will definitely cure various diseases in a short period of time. If you can come to this clinic for electrotherapy injections at the same time, we can guarantee a cure.

### Don't Let Withered Breasts Lead to a Tragic Situation!

— American Medical Doctor and Chong Pei

Actively Salvage the Sea of Regret

Whatever it is, if everyone is ignorant of it, doesn't pay attention to it, doesn't compare it, then it's just ordinary and unremarkable, and you can't tell what's good or bad, superior or inferior. But once it's revealed and carefully compared, then not only is the good and bad clearly distinguished, the superior and inferior are immediately judged, but also the good seems even better, and the inferior is even worse.

Now, let's take the development of a woman's breasts as an example. Before we doctors loudly proclaimed it, everyone didn't pay much attention to it. Because they didn't pay much attention to it, many women with withered breasts were not considered hateful by society. But later, we elaborated on the various advantages and disadvantages of withered breasts in various medical publications, and scholars advocated for it in their writings. As a result, men's aesthetic views on women have greatly changed. Now, not only do modern men openly take tall breasts and a healthy physique as the standard for choosing a wife, but also women with more progressive ideas are working hard to develop their breasts as their only important task! Indeed, no one in life doesn't hope for happiness. If they are once invaded by disease, or have irregular menstruation, malnutrition, severe illness, or excessive sorrow, leading to withered breasts and loss of beauty, then not only will they be unable to attract attention and cause knowing smiles in social situations, but they will also fear that they will encounter setbacks in choosing a husband or that marital discord will lead to various incidents, falling into a tragic situation in life, which is a lifelong regret! If you want to remedy it, you can only actively take the female "Reproductive Element," a preparation of gonadal ovarian endocrine, which is most effective for this symptom. The reason is that this agent was invented by Austrian medical saint Dr. Staner after more than 30 years of arduous practical experimentation. Therefore, the medicine is the most gentle and the effect is the greatest. It can be taken regularly in both severe winter and hot summer. If you continue to take it for a season, it can not only make withered breasts become plump and tall, make your cheeks rosy, and enhance your health and beauty, but also produce a large number of new cells in your body, enhance your natural resistance, prevent all diseases, and always maintain health and well-being.

### Gonorrheal Prostatitis

The prostate gland is located in a crucial part of the internal reproductive organs. Some people with gonorrhea do not develop cystitis or orchitis, but no one does not develop prostatitis. The only reproductive function of the prostate gland is to secrete a kind of prostatic fluid. This fluid must flow out with the semen during sexual intercourse, and is an essential element for nourishing sperm. Without sperm, one cannot reproduce, but having sperm without prostatic fluid also makes one unable to reproduce. This is because sperm cannot survive without prostatic fluid.

From this, it can be seen that gonorrheal prostatitis is the most easily encountered complication of gonorrhea, and it is also the symptom that most easily hinders fertility. Therefore, if gonorrhea patients develop prostatitis, they must prevent the destruction of reproductive function and quickly undergo effective treatment to avoid adverse prognoses.

Regarding the treatment of prostatitis, with new scientific discoveries, the purely local therapies of the past have been abandoned. The purely old local therapies – local surgical therapies – were nothing more than monotonous prostate massages, but it was not known that prostate massages absolutely cannot eliminate all the gonococci hidden in the glands. Therefore, local surgical massage alone has never cured prostatitis. I use the latest German Fulllimpe Electric Therapy, which is inserted directly into the part of the anus adjacent to the prostate gland, and the degree of electricity is applied according to the severity of the condition, supplemented by chemical therapy, which can be cured in a short period of time and can guarantee fertility.

### How I Directed "Sinking Abyss"

— (Wu Jiangfan)

If "Thunderstorm" introduced realist drama to the Chinese stage, then "Sinking Abyss" will be the first drama to introduce romanticism to the Chinese stage. Saying this may be too general and too narrow. (Because the connotation of "Sinking Abyss" has traces of various Western drama schools.) However, "realistic" and "romantic" are not absolutely opposed to each other. The question is whether there is "authenticity" in the work. Naturally, using this romantic method to write about the current Chinese era will definitely achieve greater results. Gorky said that realism and revolutionary romanticism complement each other, which is exactly what he meant.

The true value of the "Sinking Abyss" script is to be determined by critics, but as a performer, I feel that the collapse of the old society and the old system is depicted quite deeply in this script. Perhaps the twists and turns of the story make people think of "karma" and "destiny," but the concept of depicting the bright side is an even bigger reason. Therefore, in the performance, the fulfillment of the latter is particularly emphasized.

I believe that a director is not just an annotator of the script: reading the author's script word for word on the stage and introducing it to the audience. He should work hard to strengthen the script and actively develop the "intention" in the play. For this reason, I hope the audience will not only pity the characters in the play, but should see further. This is precisely where it is not easy to succeed.

I know that some people pay special attention to each interesting scene, interesting action, or deliberately create some stage images for the sake of formal beauty in the performance of the drama. (Even if it is inconsistent with the entire play) I don't want to try these things in "Sinking Abyss." At the same time, I never restrict the actors from doing certain actions during rehearsals (but constantly remind them of the actions that start from the psychology). I focus on the psychological disguise and changes, so that the actors are completely immersed in the role. Use explanations and repeated storytelling to make them do it. Stanislavski established the "psychological realism" of acting. In the past, "amateurs" also put forward the same slogan. This is correct. It is a pity that we have completed too little and we are still a long way from the word "ism" and need to work hard. But I dare to believe that "psychological acting" is the first step we have taken on the right path of acting. From psychology to physiology, dilute the accidental and side emphases: the inevitable and the main ones. This is the method of realism, and it is the same in literature and art, and in acting.

In "Sinking Abyss," I especially emphasize this kind of acting, and add the changes and complexity of status; and the compactness and transformation of the scene, using this close speed and rhythm.

For the romantic tendency of this play, a little bit of old performance methods are also adopted in the performance. I often put the heavier scenes in the center of the stage, but of course I take reality into account.

Realistic acting is of course the reproduction of human behavior. Therefore, the fourth wall (not applicable to theaters without a fourth wall or other types of acting), I want the actors to cross the curtain line as if they are deliberately talking to the audience. (Because the stage is small, this may not be fully achieved) When acting, you don't have to worry about your back facing the audience (of course, most of the time you still have to face the audience), turning to score left and right and other preliminary acting methods. In a few places, I also specifically used the acting of the actors' backs to obtain a stronger and more realistic effect. There is even a place—when Cai Wen (played by Xia Xia) confessed her love to Si Yuan (Xu Li), I deliberately told Cai Wen to circle around him with her back to the audience.

On the one hand, acting must abandon reflexive actions, and at the same time avoid physiological stimulation. Acting is like singing. There are many high steps from Do (assumed to be happy) to Ti (assumed to be sad), and Ti and high-pitched Do are only a hair's breadth apart. This is the difficulty.

Tairov said: Acting must be like orchestrating, and the art of the actor is only a part of it. In "Sinking Abyss," I divide the actors' performances into two types, one I call "counterpoint" and the other I call "harmonic." The former is (in a certain scene) to make the secondary performers perform in a contrasting way, whether in facial expressions, movements, postures, and positions. The latter is that the secondary performers perform in a harmonious and supporting way.

In terms of scenery, props, effects, and lighting, we also try our best to make them help the performance create an atmosphere. Being a director is originally difficult. Although I disagree with Gordon Craig's theory that the director must be a master of all arts, I know that the director must understand various arts. As such a shallow person as I am, I know that it is an attempt. If there is any success, it is due to the efforts of the actors and technical workers. As for myself, I still have to get the guidance of every audience member.

The Shanghai Drama and Art Society is a historical theater troupe. This time I am the director, and I really feel extremely apprehensive. And when I meet such a large audience, I really have nothing else to say. I would like to offer my respects and bows before the footlights:

"Please criticize without hesitation."

### Gospel for the Unschooled

— Chang Shui

Education in Shanghai seems to be very developed and very popular. Isn't it: The number of school enrollment advertisements in newspapers and the schools that are everywhere can be imagined. But if we open our eyes wide to take a look, we will know that there are still many unschooled people who have no opportunity to study.

Most of these unschooled people are apprentices, workers, and the vast majority of the working people. They could not step into the "school" at the beginning, and when they enter society, they have to use their labor to earn a living; but they do not dislike reading, and they also know that reading can understand the truth of being a person and the convenience of dealing with things. Then let's have tutoring: Although tutoring schools are quite developed in Shanghai, they are too high in degree, and those who are illiterate have no way to start reading; and the tuition is also very expensive, which cannot be afforded by workers and apprentices, so they are forever rejected outside the door of the school!

Now, these unfortunate people have gradually been noticed. As far as the author knows, following the Hudong Commune Apprentice Night School, the Alumni Association of the Fourth Zhonghua Vocational Tutoring School is also starting to run the Zhonghua Worker's Voluntary Night School. All the methods are the same as the Hudong Commune Voluntary School (completely free). The valuable thing is that the people in charge of the voluntary school are purely students who are the main body, and the teachers are also enthusiastic and excellent students. It is said that the registrants are very enthusiastic, exceeding the quota, and have already started school at the beginning of this month.

Here, in addition to being happy for a part of the unfortunate people—unschooled compatriots, I also hope that enthusiastic educators can respond and run a few more such voluntary tutoring schools.

### Appeal of Depositors of Jiangsu Bank

— Xue Haoran Shang (August 14th)

Since the Jiangsu Bank started paying deposits to depositors in the guerrilla areas at the end of last year, the methods it has set are extremely harsh, and depositors everywhere are complaining. According to the stable financial measures promulgated by the Ministry in August of the 26th year, 5% is withdrawn every week. Assuming that the deposit is 1,000 yuan, 90 yuan is allowed to be withdrawn. Although the deposit is reduced later, 50 yuan is used as the standard for each payment, and the payment is not reduced because the deposit is reduced. (Transportation and other banks are doing the same) However, the bank does not follow this method, and immediately checks according to the remaining balance of the deposit. For example, if the deposit is 1,000 yuan, 50 yuan will be paid for the first time, and 47 yuan will be paid for the next time according to 5% of the remaining 950 yuan. (And so on) Therefore, the smaller the deposit, the smaller the payment. Also, according to the Ministry's rules, if the deposit is only 300 yuan, it is allowed to be withdrawn at one time. The bank does not follow this rule and must still pay according to 5%. Not to mention that depositors in other places feel that the frequent trips are too heavy and the losses are too heavy, even those who live in Shanghai are suffering from running around often, which is unbearable. Also, the bank's daily payment time is from 9:00 am to 11:00 am. After the time limit, there is no flexibility. In this extremely short period of time, all depositors in the Beijing-Shanghai Road area who take a car to Shanghai will not be able to catch up on the same day and will have to stay in a hotel, spending more money. I originally deposited more than 900 yuan of national currency in Wuxi Jiangsu Bank. At the beginning of the payment at the end of October last year, I came to Shanghai from Wuxi and stayed in a hotel. I went to withdraw it once a week. I did this for more than two months. Later, because the travel expenses were too high, the money withdrawn was only enough for meals and accommodation. It was called withdrawing deposits, but in reality, it was equivalent to nothing. I discussed with the bank staff whether there was a way to change it. They said that it was possible to withdraw it once every few weeks. Hearing this, I was very happy. I packed my bags and returned to Wuxi, delayed for two months, and brought the passbook to Shanghai, thinking that I could withdraw the money for eight weeks. When I arrived at the bank's payment office, I learned that the bank clerk suddenly said that the maximum was four weeks and no more could be paid. Although I repeatedly asked him for help, it was ultimately ineffective. From then on, I followed the instructions and came to Shanghai once a month. Now it is estimated that there are still more than 140 yuan left in the spring. Today is the payment date, and a total of 25 yuan has been withdrawn. After deducting the round-trip travel expenses, there are only 11 yuan and a few cents left. Now, if we calculate the total, half of the original deposit of more than 900 yuan has been spent on round-trip travel expenses. If it is possible to withdraw it once every two or three months, and those with a balance of less than 300 yuan are allowed to withdraw it at one time, the loss would not be so great. I think that among the depositors, there must be many who share this appeal regarding the bank's dissatisfaction. I am specially explaining it in detail and respectfully request that your honorable publication not hesitate to give a corner of land and grant it to be published, hoping that the bank authorities will consider the difficulties of the refugees and handle it in accordance with the Ministry's regulations. Then the small number of depositors will benefit a lot. This is to the Editor, Tai Cha

Chapter Fifteen Overseas Beautiful News Suddenly Welcomes Peach Leaves Miracle in the Fire Turns into Lotus Flower

But it is strange to say that among the many students who pursued Alice, Alice had a special affection for a Chinese student named Cheng Gong. There are several reasons for this: First, Alice and Cheng Gong were in the same class, and they went to the lecture hall together every day; second, Cheng Gong's residence was very close to Alice's, and they often met on the road when they went to and from school, and they gradually became close as they talked along the way. And another reason is that the white people in the class often look down on Chinese people. This kind of racial prejudice often lies in the hearts of white youths. Especially in that Lyon University, there are many children from aristocratic families, that is, there are really many foreign playboys. They thought that Alice was a delicate French lady, how could she associate with a yellow person. They also saw them coming to school together every morning. Alice had a bicycle, and she rode her bicycle to school every day. Cheng Gong also had a bicycle, and when the two met on the road, they either rode side by side or chased each other. When they arrived at school, Alice handed her car over to Cheng Gong, and she didn't care about anything else. After school, the two sometimes took a circle in the park, or they leaned their two cars against a tree under a flower, and they sat side by side and talked. This situation inevitably aroused jealousy in the eyes of other students. They thought that Alice was fond of this Chinese youth, and couldn't so many of our handsome young men be as good as a yellow race? They couldn't help but satirize and ridicule Alice in their words. And in fact, Alice didn't have a particularly passionate love for Cheng Gong. French girls have always been lively and free, and their manners are generous. She looked at Cheng Gong, although he was a Chinese boy, his character was not bad. And he was also handsome and burly, unlike the dwarves of other Eastern countries, whose appearance was ugly, and it was annoying to see people bowing and bowing. Moreover, although the two became closer day by day, Cheng Gong never asked Alice to love him, so Alice also respected him very much. Now, because other students have satirical words to her, Alice is greatly unhappy in her heart. She said: Even in heterosexual interactions, everyone has their own reasons, and parents cannot force their children to do anything. Not to mention that Cheng Gong is a Chinese youth and a yellow race. Even if he is an Abyssinian, a black race, I want to like him, and I will like him. How can others interfere? At this time, Miss Alice couldn't help but feel resentful towards those students. Not only did she not stop interacting with Cheng Gong, but she deliberately became intimate with Cheng Gong. (171)

Random Notes on Artists

### From Stage to Screen (Part 1)

— Recorded by Yindi

— Narrated by Ms. Yuan Meiyun —

(Editor's Introduction) Ms. Yuan Meiyun is good at performing tragedies and is one of the most talented people in the Chinese film industry. Before entering the film industry, she was a small actress with more experience in theatrical art. What is published today is the process of Ms. Yuan's performance of Peking opera, and tomorrow will begin to record her life in the film industry.

Since I was ten years old, I have been engaged in stage life. My plays were taught by "Two Immortals", one is Li Qinxian and the other is Yu Lianxian. Mr. Gu Muqi, a famous chestnut friend, also enthusiastically taught me several plays.

Most people imagine that learning to act is very hard, which may be the fact, but I was very lucky. During my learning period, I was never beaten or even heard a scolding sound. I have been interested in singing since I was a child, which may be a main reason. In the red carpet art, it is inevitable to go to the pier. In other places, I have been to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, and Hangzhou has been the place where I have performed for the longest time. In addition, I have not been to farther places. As for Shanghai, there are many places where I have teamed up. In the Dan Gui First Stage, I was in the same class as Chang Chunheng and Liu Xiaoheng, performing in "The Creation of the World"; in the Gengxin Stage, I was in the same class as Wang Huchen, performing the color scene play "The First Bridge in the World"; in the Tianchan Stage, I was in the same class as Qilin Tong, Xiao Yang Yuelou, and Chen Hefeng. At that time, Da Chan performed the local opera "Three Hundred Years of the Qing Dynasty".

Yuan Hanyun, my junior sister, was the first to cooperate with me. She sang Laosheng. She and I were paired in performances in other places. At this time, we were still child actors, and everyone called us a pair of small actresses, but later Hanyun separated from me.

My entry into the film industry was entirely a chance, and it was beyond my expectation. Who knew that this chance would make me abandon my inherent ability and change to become a film worker, changing from a "singing career" to a "filming" career. Here, I have to mention Mr. Shao Zuiweng.

### The Process of Adapting "Ideal Wife" (Part 2)

— Sun Zhang

In short; Mo's profound observation of human beings and the thoroughness of the play's arrangement have made me feel greatly honored to be able to adapt and perform it. What I have tried my best to do is to fully retain the spirit of the original author, his special style, and his lively and sharp writing style, and to make him wear Chinese clothes, so that the audience deeply believes that this story happened in China and is a Chinese play.

Perhaps some people do not approve of translating scripts, and no matter how they are adapted, they cannot get rid of the foreign flavor. That's right; staging original scripts is a more important task at present, and the effect of their performance is indeed above that of translations. However; before our spoken drama has a long history and effectiveness, we need to search for and learn something more mature from the plays of other countries.

What we need to consider is the value of the script itself, whether it is related to our social habits and customs, and what the social response and its effect will be after the performance? Although we dare not have too high expectations, we cannot make it without any gain!

Looking at the whole play, "L'Ecole Des Femmes" seems to be most appropriately named "Ideal Wife", so I boldly changed the name to this.

Now; the "China-France Drama Society" is in line with the main purpose of communicating the "Chinese" and "French" art and culture, and after "The Wilderness", it staged "Ideal Wife". Therefore, I was able to discuss it with Mr. Shu Yin, the director of this play, several times, and I am grateful to Mr. Shu Yin for giving me many valuable opinions, which made "Ideal Wife" more colorful!

Finally! The play "L'Ecole Des Femmes" can be regarded as a social drama, a customs drama, a marriage drama, or a family drama. Whether it is satire, problem, or exposure, in short; a play can exist for a reason! With the enthusiasm of loving drama, I pay tribute to the original author, Molière!

The above is a draft hastily written for the special issue of "Ideal Wife" for the "China-France" public performance. Yesterday, I saw the announcement in the Shen and Xin newspapers that Mr. Tian Shujun had resigned from the position of supervisor of the "China-France Drama Society". This morning, I received a letter from Mr. Shu Yin, which made me roughly understand the reasons for the unfortunate incident that occurred in "China-France" this time. At the same time, the staging of "Ideal Wife" after "The Wilderness" has also become a pipe dream. All the efforts of the actors and directors who have been rehearsing in the heat of more than 80 degrees for ten days have been in vain.

Under the enthusiasm of loving the "isolated island" drama movement, I feel great sorrow for the misfortune suffered by "China-France". I hope that "China-France" can meet us again with a new attitude in the shortest possible time under close understanding and close cooperation. I sincerely wish!

News from bookstores indicates that "Ideal Wife" will be published today. In the current shortage of so-called scripts, I am ashamed to bring this tentative work to the readers, and I hope that the smart readers and seniors in the drama industry will give me serious guidance!

### Foreign Films Will Not Disappear from Shanghai

— Xiaochun

— The Remedy is a General Price Increase

The article "Foreign Films Will Not Be Shown in Shanghai" was published in this issue on the 10th. The reasons stated are indeed true. Due to the tight foreign exchange and the low price of the legal currency, foreign films in Shanghai are not profitable. Even second-rate films sometimes have difficulty selling even the cost of "copies". Therefore, there is a proposal to stop shipping foreign films to Shanghai for screening. But in fact, foreign film dealers will not immediately give up the Shanghai market. They have now properly negotiated a remedy with various cinemas, which is a general price increase. On the cinema side, daily expenses such as electricity, carbon electrodes, and coal have also increased, so they also quite agree to slightly increase the ticket price. It is reported that the ticket price for first-run cinemas will increase to start from one yuan, the second-run will start from forty-five cents, and the third-run will start from twenty-three cents. This move will be implemented from the first day of next month (September). Therefore, movie fans at sea do not need to worry too much. As for the film copies used for domestic films, they all rely on foreign countries, and the cost has also increased. Whether the cinemas that screen domestic films will increase prices at the same time has not been decided yet.

### Charity Dance Competition Prelude

— Being Prepared

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's charity tea dance competition, sponsored by the association, has been suspended for quite some time. Now, after discussions between Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, and various dance hall managers, it has been decided to change it to a partner dance competition, and all the dance stars in the city's dance halls will be mobilized to participate in the competition. The association will send personnel to the venues to sell charity "lucky fruit" tickets, each priced at one yuan, which can be used as dance fees. The dance stars participating in the partner dance will have their performance judged based on the number of lucky fruit tickets they receive. The competition will be divided into preliminary and final rounds. The preliminary round will be held individually at each dance hall, with all the dance stars in the hall participating. The top ten stars with the most votes will be named the "Top Ten Stars" of that dance hall. After each dance hall selects its Top Ten Stars, a suitable location will be rented for the final round, which will last for three days. The top ten stars with the most votes will be named the "Top Ten Stars of Shanghai's Dance World." The results of both the preliminary and final rounds will be published in newspapers to provide encouragement. If any dance hall wishes to arrange a performance program during the preliminary round, they should consult with the association beforehand for assistance. In addition to various trophies, prizes, and certificates of appreciation, the association will also solicit silver ding (ancient cooking vessel) and silver cups and other souvenirs from enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life, to be awarded to the enthusiastic dance stars who participate in the competition. At the end of the competition, a grand award ceremony will be held to commend benevolent spirit.

### The 璇宮 (Xuan Palace) Officially Opens

"Sinking Abyss" Honorary Performance

Since the Xuan Palace Theater began showing "Night Shanghai," the audience has been enthusiastic, and the newspapers have given it good reviews. However, because it was during a period of martial law, the opening ceremony could not be held. Therefore, it was specifically scheduled for the evening of the 18th, with Mr. Zhang Shankun, a giant in the film industry, officiating the opening, and Ms. Chen Yanyan cutting the ribbon. The evening's honorary performance will be Mr. Lin Ke's "Sinking Abyss," directed by Wu Jiangfan and starring Xia Xia, Vera, Zhang Ke, Tu Guangqi, Ye Lu, Sun Maoyun, Shen Ling, Xu Li, and others. With more than a month of rehearsals, the excellent performance is predictable.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden (Opera World)

— Xu Muyun

The Long-Legged General's Hall Meeting: Hanging Plaques and Splitting Plaques Occupy the Stage

Li and Zhang did not know the plot of the play, so I first described it to them. Then, it was handed over to the backstage to arrange for it to be performed the next day. In the play, Shu Yan played King Zhuang of Chu, Hui Sheng played the queen, Xiao Lou played Tang Jiao, and Chang Lin played Lian Yin Xianglao. During the celebration banquet in the play's Golden Palace scene, Shu Yan had a long section of "Quan Zitong Xiu De Yao Ba Ben Zou Shang" (劝梓童休得要把本奏上, advising the Empress not to present the memorial) in the Sanyan Xipi style. When Hui Sheng poured the wine, she sang and danced, with a long section of Er Liu (二六), all with many good arias. Xiao Lou had excellent acting and expressions when he was drunk and wild, and when he sobered up and repented. His performance in saving the Emperor and fighting was particularly brilliant. Although it rained heavily that night, and the colored awning was completely wet, the audience still stood under the corridors to listen until the end of the play before dispersing. Among the dan (female) actors this time, since Mei and Shang had not come and Yan Qiu had not yet become famous, Hui Sheng was particularly prominent. Moreover, she, along with Yang, Yu, Qian, and Wang (Chang Lin), were all members of the New Ming Grand Theater, so everyone naturally gave her extra support. However, when she was traveling south by train, she suddenly developed symptoms of "fa sha" (发痧, a type of illness), vomiting and diarrhea non-stop. Fortunately, Xiao Lou had brought "sha" medicine with him, which he gave her to take, and she became a little more stable. When the train arrived at Xuzhou Station, everyone got off, but all the cars in the city had been chartered by the reception office, specifically for the representatives of the various provinces residing in the city. On that day, all the Peking Opera actors arrived in Xuzhou, and even allocating dozens of cars to pick them up was still not enough. By the time Yan Qiu and Hui Sheng came out of the platform, there was not a single car left. Hui Sheng had a fever for a day and a night, and she was pale and emaciated, unable to walk a step. It so happened that I had a small matter to attend to at the station that day, so I went to the platform to have a look and immediately saw Hui Sheng's expression. Two stagehands were supporting her as she walked unsteadily. (83)
