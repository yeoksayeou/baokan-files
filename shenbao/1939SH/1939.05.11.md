### The Chinese Army Takes the Initiative; Japanese Forces on All Fronts Lack the Strength to Counterattack; Chinese Forces Northeast of Gao'an Recapture Chitu Street; Key Points South of Tongcheng Also Recaptured One After Another; Fierce Battle North of Guangzhou Imminent; Japanese Plot to Invade Shaoguan from the South Foiled

(Hong Kong) The war situation is now stable. Although the Japanese army is mobilizing on all fronts, it is purely a matter of moving forces around to shore up weaknesses, creating a false impression. They lack the strength for a major counterattack. The situation in Jiangxi is in a stalemate. There are no major battles in Guangdong. Japanese forces in central Hubei have repeatedly attacked areas north of Caijiahe, but have been repelled each time and are now quiet. Chinese forces in Anhui have captured Quanjiao. External sources report that large numbers of Chinese forces are gathering north of Guangzhou, making it impossible for the Japanese army to feel secure. The Chinese forces near Xin Street are a constant threat to the Japanese army in Guangzhou. Most of the Japanese forces have concentrated in Guangzhou city. A fierce battle north of the city is likely to break out at any moment. The Chinese forces in Hunan and Jiangxi have launched a series of successful counterattacks. The Japanese plot to threaten Shaoguan by invading from Hunan along the Yuehan Railway has been completely foiled. (10th Dispatch)

Shanggao: The Japanese forces at Jing'an Beitangkou were routed by the Chinese army on the evening of the 7th and, after continuous encirclement and attack, were completely wiped out on the 8th.

On the morning of the 8th, the Japanese army reinforced from Nanchang and launched a counterattack on Niuhang. After a fierce battle all day, the Chinese army, having achieved its goal of harassing the Japanese army, moved to the area west of Niuhang and engaged in a standoff with the Japanese army. (9th Dispatch)

Miluo: At 6:00 AM on the 8th, the Chinese army attacked Puqi, killing over 80 Japanese soldiers. After Japanese reinforcements arrived, the Chinese army moved east. On the morning of the 9th, they attacked Zengjiapu (30 li east of Tingsiqiao), killing over 100 Japanese soldiers and capturing over 400 horses. The remaining Japanese forces retreated to Maqiao (15 li southeast of Tingsiqiao), and the Chinese army is pursuing them in hot pursuit. (10th Dispatch)

Gao'an: After the Chinese army recaptured Yajiuling and Fenghuangshan, the Japanese army reinforced and counterattacked for days, but were repelled each time.

The Chinese army bravely met the attack, and by the evening, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed in retreat. In this battle, the Japanese artillery battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Suzuki Takatoshi, and several hundred others were killed. (10th Dispatch)

Nanyang: The Japanese army east of Wujiadian and Xiaolindian advanced towards the Chinese side along the right flank of the highway. The Chinese army used artillery and machine guns to fire fiercely, and the Japanese army retreated in a panic. Another unit of the Chinese guerrilla force has already launched a flanking attack on the rear of Wujiadian. The Japanese army is continuing to bombard the Chinese side at Lujiawan, Dashan, Yangshansi, and other places. The Chinese side has suffered little damage. According to reports from the Suizao area, the fighting is fierce. After their recent defeat, the Japanese army launched another attack. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties. A unit of Japanese cavalry has been spotted around Xinglong Temple and Caiyangpu southwest of Zaoyang. The Chinese side has dispatched a team to intercept and suppress them, and a fierce battle has broken out. (9th Dispatch)

Taiping: Quanqian in southern Anhui, taking advantage of the fact that the Chinese army launched a large-scale attack on Nanchang and the Japanese army's forces were exhausted, also launched an attack on the night of the 6th.

Location Undisclosed: Late at night on the 8th, a large number of Japanese warships were spotted sailing west in the Beihai Sea. It is said that they were carrying reinforcements from Taiwan to Guangzhou. (9th Dispatch)

The Chinese Army Once
Recaptured Xianning City

Pingjiang: On the 7th, the Chinese army once recaptured Xianning. Due to communication delays, the good news has only just arrived. Since the Chinese army occupied Xianning Station on the 29th of last month, they have continued to besiege the Japanese army in the city. Progress has been smooth in recent days, and they finally entered Xianning on the morning of the 7th. The Japanese army suffered over 600 casualties under the fierce attack of the Chinese army. The Chinese army captured two machine guns and 58 rifles, and destroyed all of the Japanese ammunition and supplies. Subsequently, Japanese reinforcements came from Puqi and Heshengqiao. The Chinese army bravely charged again and inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army. After achieving the mission of depleting the Japanese forces, they chose to defend the high ground outside the city and waited for an opportunity to launch another surprise attack. (9th Dispatch)

The Chinese Army's Strategy:
Depletion as the Goal

(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman told reporters yesterday that there has been little change in the situation on all fronts in recent days. In Guangdong, the Japanese have three divisions stationed but remain on the defensive. The Chinese army attacks from time to time. In central China, the Japanese have four divisions on the south bank of the Yangtze River and four divisions north of Hankou, but there has been no major contact. However, the Chinese army launches attacks at any time to prevent the Japanese army from launching large-scale offensives. The Chinese army is paying close attention to the movements of the Japanese army. If the strength of the forces in a certain area is weak, they will launch a fierce attack. Therefore, in recent weeks, the Japanese army has suffered heavy losses and has transferred troops from Nanjing to reinforce central China. The Chinese army's actions are not significant, but they are sufficient to effectively contain the Japanese army. Although the Japanese army in Shanxi Province also has four divisions, their transportation is constantly threatened. Small units of the Chinese army often launch attacks at night, destroying their highways and bombing their railways. The spokesman stated that this represents the current strategy adopted by the Chinese army. In short, it is to avoid major contact, prevent the concentration of Japanese forces, and achieve the goal of a protracted war. (10th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)

Editorial

### The Crisis of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the concessions, protected by international treaties, have become the largest refuge for people from the southeastern provinces. The population within the concessions has surged to over five million, and various industries and businesses related to daily life have experienced rapid development. However, the nature of this development is completely different from that before the war: industry and commerce are mainly focused on supplying the consumption needs of the five million residents. Therefore, this prosperous industry and commerce is abnormal rather than normal. Recently, this abnormal industry and commerce seems to be showing signs of collapse due to the rise in general prices. Most of the goods have always been intended for domestic sales. Now that the roads for inland trade are blocked, the goods stockpiled in the concessions are becoming more expensive. Although there are many reasons for this, it indicates an impending crisis.

Shanghai is called an isolated island because the Shanghai concessions rely mainly on ocean vessels for external transportation. Raw materials needed for industry and goods needed for commerce within the concessions depend on foreign countries. The soaring exchange rates make goods expensive. A small portion is obtained from the interior, but due to taxes, transportation costs, and various unexpected losses, items such as raw cotton, silk, and meat have been seriously affected. For example, the price of raw oil has almost doubled in the past two weeks. There are also a few people who take advantage of the situation to manipulate prices, hoard goods, and speculate for profit. While most people engaged in industry and commerce in Shanghai today are doing so to maintain a living, some people want to take this opportunity to make a fortune. For example, the recent soaring rice prices are said to be due to the fact that some hoarders are not only unwilling to sell, but are also buying large quantities in the market. Their intention is only to make money, but the result is that they are creating factors that disrupt the social order within the concessions. In addition, most speculators with idle funds are shifting their speculative targets to various daily necessities due to the price limits on public bonds and the control of foreign exchange. This speculative activity is not enough to balance the lack of price regulation, and it may even lead to tragic results for normal industry and commerce.

Many enlightened people in the business community know that industry and commerce experience cycles of prosperity and decline even in normal times. Moreover, the industry and commerce of Shanghai today is purely for the purpose of local consumption and will never maintain long-term prosperity. Anyone investing in industry and commerce should not be tempted by temporary profits and must carefully consider the situation. They must also recognize that Shanghai's environment is in an extraordinary period. Those residing in Shanghai and engaged in industry and commerce should also be especially aware of this extraordinary period. The extraordinary period is not a reasonable period for making a fortune. Everyone should consider how we should run industry and commerce to be worthy of this period.

According to the latest customs report, Shanghai's foreign trade in the first quarter of this year amounted to 80 million yuan in exports and 130 million yuan in imports, with a trade deficit of 48 million yuan. Imports and exports accounted for more than 40% of the total national trade. In recent years, the Chinese government has actively adjusted foreign trade, and last year the country still had a deficit of over 120 million yuan. This illustrates the irrationality of the Shanghai phenomenon on the one hand, and on the other hand, we can objectively conclude that it is a leak in China's national economy and a crisis for the Chinese national economy.

If we set aside economics and discuss it from a social perspective, the wealth made by those engaged in industry and commerce in Shanghai is nothing more than exploiting the blood and sweat of those who have no escape. From a humanitarian standpoint, this is a most immoral act. Moreover, the deliberate raising of prices and the manipulation of the market directly cause social unrest and affect themselves. The general middle and lower-level shop employees and workers are the first to feel the impact of the difficulty of life because wages cannot increase in proportion to prices, and this affects the industry and commerce. This phenomenon is not conducive to the national economy. To society, it is like draining the pond to catch all the fish. To themselves, it is cutting off the source of life. The far-reaching and negative effects are unspeakable, and the near-term consequences are accelerating the collapse of Shanghai!

The Issue of Flag-Raising in the Shanghai Concessions

### The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Reissues a Statement to the Embassies of Various Countries, Requesting them to Instruct the Authorities of Their Respective Concessions to Respect the Freedom of Flag-Raising

(Chongqing) Regarding the interference by the authorities of the French Concession and the International Settlement in Shanghai with the freedom of Chinese residents to raise flags, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made representations to the embassies of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in China, stating the importance that our government attaches to this matter and requesting them to instruct the authorities of their respective concessions. Subsequently, the British and French embassies responded, stating their difficult position regarding the concession issue and stating that the concession authorities intend to stipulate that the days for raising flags each year are January 1, March 12, March 29, May 5, July 1, August 27, October 10, and November 12, a total of eight days. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that this measure cannot be used as a solution to this matter and has made statements to the embassies of the respective countries orally and in writing, requesting them to jointly instruct the authorities of the respective concessions to respect the freedom of residents within the concessions to raise flags. In addition, regarding the suppression of freedom of speech in Shanghai's English-language Chinese newspapers, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also made representations to the British embassy, requesting rectification.

### Chinese Forces Active in Zhouzhuang; Japanese Army Suffers Crushing Defeat

All Villages Burned Down by Japanese Army

A correspondent in Suzhou reports that Zhouzhuang, in this county, is an important town among the twenty-seven townships in this jurisdiction. A few months ago, over two hundred Japanese soldiers garrisoned in the town. These Japanese soldiers were constantly subjected to ambushes from the Chinese army and had been nearly entirely wiped out. As the Japanese regarded the town as an important strategic point of Suhu, Su Zhe waterway and in order to defend this strategic point, Japanese army reinforced additional Japanese soldiers continuously. At about 3:00 am, of this month, Chinese army with X hundred soldiers attacked from Jishuigang, Dongtuogang, and Nanhu from 3 directions. At the time, Japanese sentry discovered the intrusion and fired warning shots. Other Japanese soldiers rushed out of beds to fight.

Because of the deep of night, Japanese soldiers used houses as shields to fire gun shots randomly. Chinese army launched attacks from East, West, South, and North sides. Finally, Chinese army, by using advantage of geographical advantage had prevailed over the Japanese soldiers and occupied the town. The operation took 3 hours. 9 Japanese soldiers and one translator had been killed, in addition, large number of ammunition and foods had been plundered.

### British Parliamentarians Sympathize with China's Resistance War; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Sends Reply of Thanks; The Chinese Nation Will Certainly Strive for Justice and Peace

(Chongqing) Four British Members of the House of Lords and thirty-two Members of the House of Commons, in light of the recent victories achieved by Chinese troops on various fronts, jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek some days ago to express their congratulations. They also specifically pointed out that any pact for peace established by democratic nations must include China. After receiving the telegram, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek immediately replied to the British Parliamentarians, expressing his gratitude for their deep concern for China's resistance war. The full text of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's reply and the British Parliamentarians' telegram are recorded below.

"Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Reply": Upon receiving your telegram, I am grateful for your concern for our entire nation's united struggle for national independence, and I express my admiration and congratulations. I respectfully represent all my compatriots in expressing our thanks. Our Chinese nation will certainly strive to the end for human justice and world peace, and will not betray the enthusiasm and expectations of you all and those worldwide who sympathize with our resistance war. I hope that you will strive for peace and justice, uphold fairness and truth, and achieve our common goals. Chiang Chung-cheng bows.

"Telegram from British Parliamentarians": To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Your Excellency, We salute the unity of your nation's military and people in their struggle for national freedom. We offer our congratulations for recent successful counter-offensives. Your nation is a crucial part of the global struggle against aggression and the safeguarding of European peace, and the British people deeply admire you. We all believe that any pact for peace established by democratic nations must include your country. (Names omitted) Respectfully. (10th Dispatch)

China's Problem Cannot Be Ignored

(London) An editorial in the Manchester Guardian stated, "European individuals, overly concerned with their own safety, seem to be increasingly forgetting the situation in China. In short, the Chinese people are currently facing national difficulties, and among our current problems, the China issue is the most crucial and the most serious." (9th Dispatch)

### Kung Hsiang-hsi Discusses Relief Issues

(Chongqing) According to Dr. Kung Hsiang-hsi, President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance, in his statement today to a United Press reporter, the Chinese government is currently making every effort to assist farmers and impoverished people behind the Japanese front lines to resist Japanese economic control and achieve the goal of total war. According to Kung, "Of the provinces currently embroiled in the war, 1,000 counties have not been affected by the Chinese administrative structure, while only 7% have been affected. In the past year, the central government has remitted funds to provincial chairmen and provincial relief agencies to provide relief to the impoverished people behind the Japanese front lines. Since the implementation of this method, there have been no difficulties so far, so the government will continue to remit funds through this channel to provide relief to the impoverished people in these areas. However, only in special circumstances will the government ask international charitable organizations for assistance. At the same time, the government expresses its gratitude for the work results of international charitable organizations."

Legal Tender Issue Needs No Concern

When discussing the issue of the Japanese prohibition of the circulation of legal tender, Kung stated, "The areas where the Japanese can prohibit the circulation of legal tender are only those where Japanese troops are stationed. At the same time, the number of places where Japanese troops are stationed is, in fact, not large, so there is no need to worry." When discussing the relationship between the cooperative movement and the revival of Chinese industry, Kung stated, "This movement is extremely healthy, because this movement not only provides farmers with technical and economic assistance, but also enables farmers to cooperate with each other." When discussing the future of China's resistance war, Kung expressed extremely firm faith, and said that this war has given us many lessons. Regarding economic aspects, the experience we have gained is abundant and rich, so the methods of management and deployment are more perfect than before. Therefore, our position has been greatly strengthened compared to the past. I firmly believe that China's resistance war will last for at least several more years. As for the construction of a new China after the war, it will depend on the assistance of Western countries. The economic assistance to China from Britain, the United States, and France during this war of resistance will certainly make the economic cooperation between China and Western countries after the war even closer. The form of this cooperation will be large-scale investments by various countries in China's transportation industry and heavy industry. At the same time, China will certainly make significant progress after the war.

Foreign Investment Can Certainly Be Predicted

"Here, financiers from all friendly nations have excellent opportunities to both assist in the development of Chinese industry and find a way out for their domestic surplus capital." Dr. Kung stated, "Currently, the development of southwestern China is mostly funded by domestic Chinese capital, because most of the businesses have moved there from the Yangtze River basin. However, foreign capital also occupies an important part. The investment in railways, truck transport, and highways is mostly foreign capital. I firmly believe that foreign capital will certainly flow in continuously in the future. As for economic construction plans in the occupied areas, the government should enable the people in these areas to be self-sufficient. All economic activities in the occupied areas should aim solely at self-sufficiency." (9th United Press Dispatch)

### Guangzhou Taiwan Bank Robbed of 350,000 Yuan; Chinese Guerrillas Display Great Skill

(Hong Kong) According to reliable sources today, the reason why the Japanese military authorities suddenly declared martial law in Guangzhou at the end of last week was because the Taiwan Bank in Guangzhou was robbed. The details of this matter are roughly as follows: One hundred Chinese guerrillas, all dressed in plain clothes and carrying weapons, robbed the Taiwan Bank on Sunday. The three Japanese soldiers guarding the bank were all monitored. They broke into the bank's vault and robbed 260,000 yuan in legal tender and 90,000 yuan in silver coins. The Japanese side only found out twenty minutes after the Chinese guerrillas had fled, and immediately issued a martial law order and searched the city extensively. According to the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou, many suspects have been apprehended. However, according to Chinese reports, none of the Chinese guerrillas who participated in the bank robbery were arrested. Also, the movement of Japanese troops north of Guangzhou yesterday was intended to prevent the Chinese guerrillas from joining forces with the Chinese irregular army north along the Yuehan Railway.

(Moscow) The Soviet official TASS News Agency recently published the following communique, stating, "According to reports received here from London, Reuters recently published a message stating that the British reply to the Soviet government's proposal contains the following fundamental points: First, the Soviet Union should separately guarantee each neighboring country. Second, if the Soviet Union becomes involved in war as a result of implementing the guarantee, Britain pledges to assist." According to Soviet authoritative sources, TASS has the right to declare that Reuters' above-mentioned message is not entirely consistent with the facts. On May 8, the Soviet government did indeed receive a British counterproposal, to which the French government did not object. This counterproposal did not declare that the Soviet Union should separately guarantee each neighboring country, but only stated that if Britain and France became involved in military action as a result of fulfilling their obligations to Poland and Romania, the Soviet government must immediately assist Britain and France. However, if the Soviet Union becomes similarly involved in military action as a result of fulfilling its obligations to a certain country in Eastern Europe, then we should, on a reciprocal basis, be assisted by Britain and France. The British government's counterproposal did not mention this." (9th TASS Dispatch)

(London) Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited the British Foreign Office this morning to discuss "the misunderstandings that have arisen in the current stage of the British-Russian negotiations." (10th Havas Dispatch)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that the message released by Moscow yesterday regarding the negotiations between Britain and Russia to form an anti-aggression bloc seemed to be based on a misunderstanding, as it was not consistent with the content of the British government's proposal. The British government previously issued a declaration, stating that after accepting binding agreements with Eastern European countries, it suggested that the Soviet Union clearly express that if Britain and France were to participate in the war as a result of fulfilling these binding agreements, the Soviet Union would also be prepared to provide assistance. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, put forward a broader and more stringent proposal, which caused difficulties in the negotiations. The British government then notified the Soviet government of the difficulties and revised certain points contained in its original proposal. It also explained to the Soviet Union that the British government did not initially want to force the Soviet Union to accept the binding agreements, so that regardless of whether Britain and France had fulfilled their obligations, the Soviet Union would still have to come forward to participate. However, if the Soviet Union wanted to make Britain and France's fulfillment of their binding agreements a condition for its participation, the British government had no objection. Yesterday, Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax and said that according to the British proposal, a situation could arise in the future that would force the Soviet Union to intervene, while Britain and France could remain aloof, which the Soviet Union was still uncertain about. Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately provided assurances that this was not Britain's intention. Chamberlain concluded that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds had visited Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov two days prior, and Molotov informed him that the British proposal was being closely studied. Therefore, "we are now awaiting an answer from the Soviet Union." (10th Havas)

(London) This afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain described the progress of the British-Soviet negotiations in the House of Commons. Because this matter was eagerly anticipated by everyone, the House was packed. The Prime Minister said that the British government had followed its stated policy of assisting Eastern European countries to resist any attempt to threaten their independence, and had accepted practical binding agreements with these countries. The British government, seeing that asking the Soviet Union to directly participate in these binding agreements would inevitably cause some difficulties, took on the responsibility itself without inviting the Soviet Union to participate. The Soviet government simultaneously put forward a plan, which, in the view of the British government, would avoid the disputes that the Soviet proposal sought to avoid, and would inevitably be difficult to avoid. Therefore, the British government explained this to the Soviet government. (10th Reuters Dispatch)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that there would soon be an opportunity to explain the progress of the negotiations between Britain and Turkey on the issue of forming an anti-aggression bloc, but it was not convenient to announce anything at present. Opposition Labour Party Member of Parliament Henderson immediately asked, "Regarding the progress of these negotiations, the government has not yet made any report. Should we wait until the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are completed before doing so?" Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "No." (10th Havas Dispatch)

### Five-Nation Conference Unlikely to Materialize; Vatican Denies Suggestion

(London) The Vatican's moves to seek a solution to Europe's thorny problems have aroused widespread concern from the outside world. It is rumored that the Pope has "advised" Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland to hold a conference to seek a special solution to the issues of Danzig and the Mediterranean. It is rumored that explorations are underway in the capitals of various countries, and the Catholic side sincerely supports the steps taken by the Pope. (9th Reuters Dispatch)

Vatican City: Rumors that Pope Pius XII had proposed a conference of representatives from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland to seek friendly solutions to Europe's major problems have been denied by Vatican officials. However, they added that the Pope is eager for a peaceful solution to Europe's problems and has instructed envoys stationed in certain countries to explain this intention to the governments of their host countries, which is the actual situation. (9th Havas Dispatch)

(Paris) Responsible sources say that the Pope has not made any concrete proposals, so the issue of a five-nation conference of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland has not arisen. (10th Reuters Dispatch)

(Paris) Responsible sources here recently declared that the negotiations that the Vatican made yesterday with the governments of Britain, France, and Poland are, to date, purely informal in nature. Although the Vatican advocates that Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland hold a conference to resolve the issue of the Free City of Danzig and other issues, thereby easing the current tense situation, it has not put forward any concrete suggestions. In essence, the Vatican's initiative is still in its initial stages. It is still unpredictable whether it will stop halfway or change completely. In short, Pope Pius XII's actions, which aim to establish greater understanding between the countries concerned, are commendable. However, the complexities of the current issues and the convening of an international conference will inevitably cause various difficulties. The governments of Britain, France, and Poland will exchange views in the short term to decide on their attitude. (9th Havas Dispatch)

(Berlin) Regarding the Vatican's call for peace, none of the German newspapers mentioned it. Political figures did not express a welcome, saying that although Germany was not absolutely opposed to the convening of an international conference, it did not believe that it could have any effect. If the dispute between Germany and Poland is to be resolved, it can only be done if Poland accepts "Germany's legitimate demands." (9th Havas Dispatch)

### Soviet Attitude Makes London Feel Uneasy; Difficulty Lies in Establishing Military Alliance; But Negotiation Door Still Open

(London) News Chronicle diplomatic correspondent Bartley wrote a special editorial today, saying that the Soviet Union's statement regarding the British proposal surprised people in London last night. Britain did not say that the Soviet Union would cooperate in the defense of the borders of Britain or France, so this statement must be seen as the Soviet Union insisting on its demand to conclude a universal alliance with Britain and France, including all of Europe, not only limited to the countries that Britain had undertaken to defend without consulting the Soviet Union. People in London pointed out that Britain's answer was in the nature of a suggestion or offering an opinion, so the door to continued discussion remains wide open today. (10th Reuters Dispatch)

(London) The News Chronicle expressed disappointment that Britain and the Soviet Union had not yet concluded a military alliance. The rest of the newspapers are optimistic about the British-Soviet negotiations. The Daily Telegraph's Moscow correspondent stated that the Soviet Union hopes to conclude a military alliance with Britain as soon as possible, so that Britain and France can come to the aid of the Soviet Union in the event of a war between Germany and Poland. The Daily Mail reported that the Soviet Union has temporarily abandoned its demand to conclude a three-nation treaty with Britain and France and is preparing to unilaterally provide assistance and guarantees to six countries: Romania, Poland, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. (10th Haitong Dispatch)

(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the meeting between British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds and Soviet People's Committee Chairman and Foreign Minister Molotov was very cordial. Molotov naturally needs time to consider the British proposals. There is no reason to say that there has been any change in the main direction of Soviet foreign policy. (9th Reuters Dispatch)

(London) Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon to discuss the issue of forming an anti-aggression bloc. Official sources here immediately declared that the talks were extremely harmonious. The new counterproposal that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds made to the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs advocated that if Britain and France were drawn into the vortex of war by assisting Poland and Romania, then the Soviet Union should immediately provide assistance at the request of Britain and France. Sir Seeds also explained to Molotov that Britain and France would first fulfill their obligations to the two Baltic countries in the event of war, and would never stand idly by and listen to the Soviet Union alone assisting those countries. Foreign Secretary Halifax also reiterated this point when he received Soviet Ambassador Maisky today. However, it is still expected that the Soviet government will raise certain objections. In addition, Molotov provided assurances to Sir Seeds that Soviet foreign policy would not change due to the departure of the former People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov. (9th Havas Dispatch)

(Moscow) Regarding the issue of forming an anti-aggression bloc, British Ambassador Sir Seeds is currently waiting for the Soviet government to submit a reply after personally handing over the new counterproposal to People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov. Molotov's conversation with Polish Ambassador Grzybowski yesterday has been taken very seriously by the general public. It is said that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland has been improving day by day in accordance with Britain's wishes. There are three pieces of evidence: (1) The Soviet government has appointed Sharonov as its ambassador to Poland. (2) Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin is visiting Poland. (3) There is a rumor that the Soviet government is appointing a minister to Romania. As for the reports in London that the Soviet Union has agreed to provide guarantees to its neighboring countries, namely Poland, Romania, and the Baltic countries, well-informed sources here have denied this. (9th Havas Dispatch)

(London) Regarding the issue of forming an anti-aggression bloc, Soviet sources here recently declared that the Soviet government will propose at least two conditions for the British new counterproposal: (1) After the Soviet Union accepts the binding agreements, the countries concerned should agree on cooperation methods in the military. (2) The guarantees provided by the countries concerned should be extended to the countries along the Baltic Sea. British government officials say that regarding the first point, it is not impossible for staff officers of the countries concerned to hold talks. Regarding the second point, it is not something that Britain can decide alone. In any case, it can be said with certainty that negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union will be delayed.

### Four Nordic Countries Decide to Remain Neutral; Reply to Hitler Separately; Denmark Accepts Suggestion

Swedish Capital: After the meeting in Norway, Sweden, and Finland yesterday, they will give a humble reply to Hitler's proposal to conclude a non-aggression pact. Denmark feels that it has no choice but to accept Hitler's proposal. According to the communique issued last night, the Nordic countries will reply separately. (10th Reuters Dispatch)

Capital of Sweden: The foreign ministers of the four Nordic countries, namely Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, held a meeting at 10:30 a.m. today and continued the meeting in the afternoon, issuing a communique stating that the four Nordic countries have decided to strictly maintain neutrality and avoid participating in any political groups. "However, if other countries can issue a statement willing to respect the territorial integrity and independent sovereignty of the four Nordic countries, they will be welcomed. If any country wants to establish a certain pact and seeks the opinions of the four Nordic countries, it should submit answers separately to ensure that its determination to maintain impartial neutrality can be deeply believed by other countries." (9th Havas Dispatch)

Swedish Capital: After the end of the meeting of the foreign ministers of Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Sweden, a communique was issued here tonight, deciding that the four countries will not join the various blocs organized by the great powers, and will do their best to avoid being drawn into the vortex in the event of war. They have considered on this basis whether it is appropriate to sign an anti-aggression pact. The foreign ministers will report the results of the discussion to their respective governments. (9th Reuters Dispatch)

Swedish Capital: The government has asked Parliament to approve Sweden's and Finland's plan to guarantee the neutrality of the Åland Islands. According to Foreign Minister Sandler, the countries that signed the 1911 treaty on the demilitarization and neutrality of the Åland Islands, such as Germany, Denmark, Estonia, France, Britain, Italy, Latvia, and Poland, have replied to Sweden and Finland's note on the demilitarization of the islands, all expressing their support for the new proposal.

### Governor of Libya Visits Egyptian Authorities; Guarantees No Threat to Egypt

Cairo: The Governor of Italian Libya, General Balbo, had an audience with King Farouk I today. (10th Havas)

Cairo: Prime Minister Basha received the Governor of Italian Libya, Balbo, today for about half an hour. It is reported that Balbo guaranteed Italy's friendship with Egypt and pledged that the Italian army in Libya would not threaten Egypt. (10th Reuters)

Cairo: Political figures here confirmed last night that the Governor of Italian Libya, General Balbo, came here to propose to the Egyptian government the conclusion of an Italian-Egyptian non-aggression treaty. The government newspaper Al-Balagh published an editorial saying that the future of the conclusion of an Italian-Egyptian non-aggression pact is unclear. We believe that if Italy can reduce the number of troops stationed in Libya, the effect of stabilizing the Egyptian people will be greater than that of a non-aggression treaty. (10th Haitong Dispatch)

### Italian Foreign Minister Receives German Army Commander

(Rome) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano received German Army Commander-in-Chief General Brauchitsch at his official residence yesterday for about half an hour. Brauchitsch then led his entourage to the Italian naval base in Spezia in the evening, accompanied by Italian Army Commander-in-Chief General Pariani, to visit the defense works there, before setting off to return home. (10th Haitong Dispatch)

### US War Risk Insurance Rates for Europe Lower

(New York) The reduction in war risk insurance rates has been implemented yesterday. The war risk insurance rates for goods shipped to Germany and Italy last month had to be determined when the goods were shipped, but now they have been restored to the standard insurance rate.

### Anglo-Russian Negotiations: Japan Attempts to Restrain, British Policy Remains Unmoved, Believing Japan is Already Bogged Down

(London) According to Tokyo sources, Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita, in a speech at the national prefectural governors' conference, stated that if Britain establishes a relationship of understanding with the Soviet Union, even if it does not involve the Far East, Japan would not take it lightly.  Recently, a person close to the British Foreign Office commented, roughly stating that Foreign Minister Arita had clearly expressed in a recent meeting with British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie that although Japan would not pursue an anti-British policy under normal circumstances, it would be a different matter if the ties between Britain and the Soviet Union intensified to a degree that clearly threatened Japan. Ambassador Craigie replied that the agreement being drafted by Britain and the Soviet Union, if limited to Europe, would not pose a threat to Japan. Now, viewing Foreign Minister Arita's statement to the prefectural governors' conference, his views on the issue of a British-Soviet agreement are clear. However, current British policy will not change, for two reasons: (1) The British authorities hesitate to fully embrace the Soviet Union, fearing further cooperation between Japan and the German-Italian axis less than from a purely European perspective.  This is because if Britain were too close to the Soviet Union, it would be difficult to gain the cooperation of Portugal and Spain. (2) Britain believes that Japan is currently adopting a "sitting on the fence" attitude and is not cooperating further with the German-Italian axis. This is less due to the impending British-Soviet agreement and more due to a purely Far Eastern perspective. In essence, Japan is already bogged down in China and eager to avoid Soviet interference.  If Japan were to cooperate closely with the German-Italian axis, the United States might pursue a more aggressive policy in the Pacific, hence their hesitation. Therefore, Britain will consistently pursue its current policy, striving for the Soviet Union's full support to prevent German aggression against Poland and Romania. In short, even after the successful conclusion of British-Soviet negotiations, Japan may not fundamentally change its policy unless it has other prejudices and uses the British-Soviet agreement as an excuse.

### How Can Married Men Enjoy Lasting Happiness and Health?

Health and happiness are closely related, so the two words have now become a single term. If we use marriage as an analogy, that is the most apt. A weak man's life after marriage will not only place the burden of the family on his shoulders, feeling incapable, but also his marital life will inevitably be unhappy, with no love at all. Wouldn't this just increase the pain?

Let's be frank, the reason why adult men and women marry is nothing more than to pursue happiness. Indeed, a couple who are healthy and beautiful, when the flowers are in bloom, will inevitably have deep love, tenderness, and sweetness.  Bearing and raising children, the family will be harmonious and happy. When doing things, they will cooperate with one heart. What a beautiful and happy life this is! In order to achieve happiness, a husband must seek ways to improve his health. So, how can he improve his health? First, he must abide by the laws of love, preferring scarcity to excess. If either husband or wife discovers illness, they should rest and recuperate with care, temporarily sleeping in separate beds. If the house is small with few beds, they should still sleep with separate blankets. When health is truly restored, love will naturally return, and the joy at that time will surely surpass that of the honeymoon. Moreover, this kind of joy is enough to gladden the heart and is very beneficial to the body. Therefore, it is said: as long as it is managed well, love and health can grow together. "A broad mind and a stout body" is something everyone knows.

However, if a man has committed masturbation or nocturnal emission in his early years, or due to post-marital debauchery, excessive indulgence, or worry and overwork, his sexual function explodes with spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, apathy, infertility, neurasthenia, etc., then not only will his sallow complexion and gaunt appearance fail to arouse his wife's affection, but also in the love life that is the foundation of the marriage, his wife will inevitably be dissatisfied. When will his wishes be fulfilled? How many years, months, and days will he have to wait? How can this not make his wife resent him! Most tragedies in marriage arise from this!

A wise husband who wants to remedy this must fundamentally cure his illness. According to the world's famous doctors and my own many years of experience at home and abroad, the most effective treatment is to take the gonad extract "Gonadin," which is most effective for the symptoms. The endocrine therapy of the gonads was originally invented by Dr. Stenach, a leading figure in European physiology, and shocked the medical world at the time. It was believed that there was a technique for curing disease, prolonging life, and rejuvenating. However, the implementation method was quite difficult and could not be popularized among the public. Later, Dr. Stenach and other renowned European and American doctors such as Geattes and Moderry continued to research and improve it.  They extracted gonad hormones from strong animals such as gorillas and sea dogs and replicated them into a drug using scientific methods, naming it Stenach's "Gonadin" in memory. Therefore, the quality of this drug is precious and its efficacy is great, truly the crown of all essence or endocrine preparations. After taking it, it can produce semen and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate the blood, and nourish the nerves in one day and night. If it is taken continuously, it will surely completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time. It can also benefit longevity and prolong life. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hemet's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" to strengthen the seminal gate and stop leakage, so that both the root and the branch are treated, and the results will be quickly achieved.

### The Crisis of Nocturnal Emission in Early Summer

— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Summer is the season for the occurrence of various viruses because the weather is hot and various tissues in the body will relax. Therefore, if a person suffers from nocturnal emission, although the frequency is still low, as the weather gradually warms up, the frequency will gradually increase, and the symptoms will tend to worsen. This has been proven by many years of treatment experience. Therefore, treating nocturnal emission in early summer is still timely. If treatment is missed at this time, some will develop spermatorrhea from nocturnal emission; some will have their developmental functions affected by nocturnal emission, weakening metabolism, resulting in incomplete development, and the local area being short and small like a child's; some will become sallow and emaciated, prematurely aging, or even dying young; as for the weakening of the brain, bone marrow, and sexual nerves caused by nocturnal emission, symptoms such as headache, throbbing pain, occasional dizziness, difficulty thinking, weak memory, lower back pain, scattered energy, premature ejaculation, and impotence will follow. How can such a young person continue his studies and make progress in academics? How can he seek employment to support himself? Moreover, in marital life, he will inevitably fail to fulfill his natural instincts and responsibilities, and be hated by his wife! A happy family will be plunged into a miserable hell! In short, the bad consequences of untreated nocturnal emission are the most bitter and difficult to bear in life.

According to my many years of experience at home and abroad, the most effective treatment for nocturnal emission is "Hemet's Semen-Consolidating Tablets." This medicine can consolidate the seminal gate, calm the nerves, reduce nightmares, and promote restful sleep, so that nocturnal emission can be cured. If the above symptoms have already been caused by nocturnal emission, you must also take the gonad extract "Gonadin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase semen and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it, you will surely restore your happiness and health in a short period of time.

Beauty

### The Breasts in Early Summer: The Most Active Season

— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

The weather is gradually getting warmer. In a world where nudity, exposure, and openness are not yet prevalent, only the healthy and beautiful women can show off their style. Look, haven't many women already been wearing gauze cheongsams or Indian silk cheongsams in the past few days? They naturally show off their beautiful, moving curves with their slender figures, plump muscles, and thin clothes. Especially the pair of breasts in front of the chest, even more like heroes with a place to use their skills, are vigorously active inside the clothes. It seems to be telling people: "This is a unique talent of our healthy and beautiful women. Unhealthy women who have lost their beauty, don't even think about having this proud posture"!

This is certain. Unhealthy women who have lost their beauty must have irregular menstruation, persistent leucorrhea, neurasthenia, anemia, and multiple diseases and pains, resulting in damage to ovarian function, affecting metabolism, and gradually withering. As a result, their complexions are haggard, their buttocks are thin, and their muscles are withered. Even in such pleasant early summer weather, wearing extremely light and fashionable clothes still makes them look like pieces of pepper-salted ribs, with no trace of beautiful, moving flesh, or even making them look even uglier, causing them to be sneered at by men and losing all happiness! The only way to remedy this, according to the world's famous gynecologists and my own experience, is to take the ovarian preparation "Gonadin" for women, which is the most effective treatment. This drug is extracted from the essence of young animal ovaries and prepared using scientific methods, so the medicinal properties are mild and the effects are great. It can be taken regardless of cold or heat. If it is taken during the spring and summer seasons, the effect is even more significant. If it is taken continuously, it can not only cure the above symptoms but also make the withered breasts gradually rise in a short period of time, completing a firm and elastic state. In addition, it can regulate menstruation, promote conception, rosy cheeks, and maintain youth.

### Gonorrheal Rheumatism

Gonorrheal rheumatism is one of the most terrible symptoms in systemic gonorrhea. The reason is that gonococci invade the bloodstream, circulate with the blood, and occupy various tissues, harming joints, synovial fluid, fascia, tendons, and ligaments, thus causing rheumatism. Generally, two or three weeks after infection, the joints will become inflamed, swollen, and severely painful. Serous fluid accumulates in the joints. If the condition is mild and treated properly, it can be cured in a short period of time. If the inflammation has subsided, in many cases, it often turns into so-called joint stiffness, causing the joints to be unable to move and become stiff, like a disability. The happiness of the second half of life is often sacrificed to this type of gonorrheal rheumatism, which is truly lamentable. However, if effective treatment can be applied, although the recovery period may be slightly longer than in the acute stage, it can still be saved, so there is no need to despair.

For the treatment of gonorrheal rheumatism, it is necessary to rest quietly, then apply topical applications, and inject German Hesi bactericidal serum. If the joint has already become suppurated, puncture is necessary, and it should be washed with Ligonal solution. In terms of electrotherapy, the latest German-invented Filtrin direct current electrotherapy is particularly effective for this disease. To cure this disease, it is necessary to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, relieve pain, break down adhesive joints, filter the gonorrheal toxins in the blood, and drain the pus at the same time. Only then can rapid treatment be achieved. I have been in clinical practice for more than ten years. Based on my experience, using the above methods to cure gonorrheal rheumatism has always achieved satisfactory results. Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM

### Improved Russo-Polish Relations: Poland Expresses Delight, Will Not Conspire with Germany to Covet the Russian Border, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Visits Foreign Minister Beck

Warsaw  Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin, met with Polish Foreign Minister Beck this afternoon for a lengthy discussion. It is reported that the two discussed recent events in general terms, regarding Russo-Polish relations and changes in Germany's attitude towards Poland. (Reuters, 10th)

Warsaw  Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin, after arriving here, visited Colonel Beck, the Foreign Minister at 12:30 this afternoon and is scheduled to return to Moscow this afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Warsaw  Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin, arrived in the capital of Romania tonight. The Soviet Charge d'Affaires to Poland, Lisdobad, met him at the border and accompanied him by car. Potemkin immediately checked into the Soviet Embassy. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Warsaw  Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin, after arriving here, told reporters from the Warsaw Post yesterday, "I am very satisfied with my talks with the Turkish authorities and believe they will contribute to consolidating peace. My meeting with Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu further proves that most countries are committed to safeguarding and strengthening peace, and Poland's position in the peace organization is also very important. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Warsaw  The semi-official Iskra News Agency recently released a message stating, roughly, that the Soviet Union is working to establish good neighborly relations with its neighboring countries, and that its relations with Poland have improved, as can be seen from the appointment of an ambassador to Poland. We are very pleased with this. Poland is very willing to enhance friendly relations with its neighbors and has repeatedly stated its importance. It goes without saying that we are satisfied with the smooth development of relations between Poland and the Soviet Union. Any plan that advocates Poland joining with a certain country to take action in the southeast, so as to divide spheres of influence in the Soviet Caucasus, Ukraine, Little Russia, and the Baltic coast, is firmly rejected by Poland. In short, "Poland's foreign policy maintains a detached nature and focuses on safeguarding its national interests. Various plans that attempt to unite Poland with a neighboring country to deal with another neighboring country have been rejected in the past and will continue to be rejected in the future. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

(London) A certain German newspaper published a message stating that Britain intends to adopt the same approach to the German-Polish dispute as it did to the Czech crisis last September. In essence, it will put pressure on Poland to persuade it to reach an agreement with Germany. Well-informed sources here recently stated, "This news is completely inaccurate and clearly has ulterior motives. The British government's position has been clearly explained to Parliament repeatedly. The conditions stipulated when guaranteeing Poland will remain unchanged. In other words, the issues related to the country's survival, when we are threatened, when to start fighting, and whether to demand that Britain fulfill its guarantee, will all be decided by the country itself. Parliamentary Secretary Butler of the Foreign Office declared in the House of Commons on the 8th of this month that if both Germany and Poland request Britain to mediate, Britain would be happy to do so, but this does not mean that Britain intends to interfere in the German-Polish issue. During the previous debate in Parliament on the British-Polish Mutual Assistance Agreement, government authorities repeatedly stated that they would not put any pressure on Poland. At the same time, the Polish authorities also repeatedly stated that they did not want a third country to mediate. It can be seen that Britain has no intention of mediating and has no intention of sending a special envoy to Warsaw, as it previously sent Lord Runciman, a member of the Privy Council, to the capital of Czechoslovakia.

### Yugoslav Regent Arrives in Rome, Italian Authorities Welcome Him Greatly

(Rome) The First Regent of Yugoslavia, Prince Paul, and Princess Olga, arrived here this morning, accompanied by Foreign Minister Marković.

At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by the King of Italy. At 4:00 PM, he met with Prime Minister Mussolini. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### Anglo-German Economic Competition in Greece

(London) At today's meeting of the British House of Commons, Labour MP Fletcher asked if British tobacco companies could purchase more tobacco from Greece to help Greece escape German economic pressure. Commerce Secretary Stanley replied that the issue of increasing imports of oriental tobacco had recently been carefully studied, but there were many difficulties. We must know that we are not an omnipotent country and cannot make people smoke tobacco they do not want to smoke. (Reuters, 9th)

Athens  A German industrial delegation has been here for many days to find sales channels and investigate the market for cotton and wool textiles manufactured in Germany. It has now returned to Berlin. According to well-informed sources, the delegation held repeated talks with economic leaders in Greece, but without success. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### British Conscription Bill Passes Second Reading

(London) The "Military Training Bill" was passed by a show of hands in the House of Commons. Before the vote, Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha announced: (1) The government will, at an appropriate time, call up a large number of soldiers from the Army Reserve for training, for a period of three months, to increase the strength of the regular army and make it a wartime establishment, ready to be deployed quickly when necessary. (2) Soldiers of the anti-aircraft artillery and auxiliary air force will be called up for training in rotation this summer, for a period of one month. (3) 3,800 soldiers of the Naval Reserve and 1,500 retired sailors will be called up for service in two batches, for a period of three months. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

(London) When Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha presented the second reading of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Military Service Bill in the House of Commons today, he stated that the situation was very different from the past, so the procedures for mobilizing the reserve and auxiliary forces had to be changed to suit the times. Most European armies are now constantly in various stages of mobilization, while British procedures are cumbersome and too slow to respond to emergencies. The bill seeks to eliminate these inconveniences. The Secretary of State then described the time limit for calling up the reserve and auxiliary forces for military training, which will begin one month after the bill becomes law. Labour MP Lawson, representing the Labour opposition, said that this was likely to be seen as the government using this power for its own purposes. The Secretary of State should give more careful consideration to the future re-employment of those who are called up. If these points can be addressed satisfactorily, the opposition party will have no objection to the passage of the bill. Conservative MP Sandys supported the bill and explained the danger of a sudden air raid. Conservative MP Dickson urged the Secretary of State to consider ways to deal with unpatriotic employers who do not hire soldiers in the volunteer army and those under the age of 20. Civil Lord of the Admiralty Llewellin replied to the debate, saying that an order to call up the reserve army must first be submitted to Parliament for approval. If Parliament believes that the situation is not appropriate, it can prevent the publication of such an order. As for the power granted to the government by the bill, there is absolutely no possibility that it will be used in any industrial disputes. Llewellin also mentioned the re-employment of soldiers called up under the bill, saying that of the 27,000 people called up by the Navy during the crisis last September, only 10 percent have not yet returned to their normal jobs. After the debate on the bill was completed, it was put to a vote and passed unanimously. (Reuters, 9th)

### US and Philippines Economic Relations: Roosevelt Reconsiders

President Roosevelt of Washington recently summoned Mr. Sayre, Assistant Secretary of State, and Mr. Tydings, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Philippine Affairs, to discuss economic relations between the United States and the Philippines. Afterwards, he announced to the press that it had been agreed that the economic relationship between the two countries should be reconsidered before the Philippines achieve independence, before July 4, 1946. Observers have commented that the government originally intended to allow the Philippines to continue enjoying preferential treatment after independence for a period of fifteen years. However, due to the situation in the Far East causing various difficulties, many within the government opposed this plan, and it has been temporarily abandoned. Individuals in diplomatic and agricultural circles advocate that Congress should pass legislation during this session to gradually increase the import tax on goods from the Philippines by five percent annually, starting from November of this year, until the Philippines achieves independence in 1946, for a total increase of twenty-five percent. From then until that time, Congress can leisurely formulate laws if it deems necessary to adapt to the situation in the Far East, allowing preferential tax rates to be applied to Philippine goods even after the Philippines achieve independence.

### US Authorities Advocate Convening an International Conference to Seek an Honorable Solution

(Washington) The tenth congress of the International Association of Military Medicine was held here today. Representatives from thirty-two countries participated. Secretary of State Hull was unable to attend due to other commitments. Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Messersmith, presided over the opening ceremony and delivered a speech, which stated, "The opening of your conference coincides with a time of international tension and global anxiety. At this moment, all nations around the world must make a crucial decision that will determine their future destiny. Looking at this decision as the defining one, in essence, whether it be peace or war, nations must make a choice as soon as possible. Maintaining peace, if there is hesitation and indecision, the outbreak of war means that even peace-loving nations are at risk of being drawn into the conflict. By that time, even if you want to decide which path to take, you may be unable to do so. Among the members of your association, there is a spirit of tolerance, empathy, and understanding. There has never been a time when this spirit is more needed among nations than now. The United States continues to believe that international order must be based on justice, respect for law, and the recognition of the fundamental principles of mankind. We earnestly hope to live in peace with all nations around the world and believe that if all nations can hold conferences on equal footing, friendly and honorable solutions can be found for all disputes. We are also willing to establish lasting peace based on friendly actions and respect for promises." It must be known that science has no borders, and the spirit of sacrifice has no limits. Herewith, I appeal to all nations around the world to do everything possible to reduce the horrors of war. It is hoped that the representatives of the participating countries will work together to achieve this goal. In addition, President Roosevelt also sent a letter to the congress, stating briefly, "When representatives from various countries gather together and discuss issues related to common interests in a friendly atmosphere, they will surely achieve great success. This is clearly demonstrated by the work of your association." (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### Japanese Planes Bomb Key Cities in Fujian Province: About 150 Casualties in Fuzhou; Yong'an, Yanping, and Jian'ou Evacuating Population; Bombing of Xiamen University a Major Cultural Loss

Fuzhou Dispatch: Over the past half month, Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Jian'ou, Tingzhou, Guantou, Mawei, Xiamen, and other places, with Fuzhou suffering the most severe damage. It has been bombed up to three times a day, and at least once. In total, there have been no fewer than fifteen bombings. The bombed areas include the commercial districts of Taijiangxun, Gulouqian, and Zhongzhou Road, as well as the residential areas of Jiucaiyuan, Beikuxiang, and Daoshan Road. In addition, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the High Court, the Police Department, the County Government, the Consolidated Tax Bureau, the County Training Institute, the Police Training Institute, the Printing House, the Relief Institute, and various other old sites of government agencies have all been destroyed. The number of bombs dropped

reached two hundred.

The number of casualties is estimated to be around one hundred and fifty, and the number of houses burned is at least one hundred. Taijiangxun and Gulouqian have been bombed as many as four or five times. The total property loss is estimated to be over two million yuan. Currently, the business hours of Fuzhou stores and government agencies have been changed to start from 5 p.m. All middle schools have been relocated inland, and all primary schools have been disbanded. Yong'an, Yanping, and Jian'ou, the three major towns in northern Fujian, are also beginning to evacuate people due to the excessive population. The authorities are also advising people to relocate to the countryside and are strengthening air defense facilities, digging air raid shelters, and increasing the number of rescue teams and fire brigades. However, because the seaports are blockaded by Japanese warships, ships from any country are subject to inspection. Any carelessness can lead to seizure. Barges unloading cargo have been repeatedly burned and looted, making it difficult to export the province's tea, wood, paper, bamboo, sugar, fruit, and other special products. It is also difficult to import flour, cloth, oil, charcoal, and other daily necessities, which has greatly impacted commerce. The people are

suffering due to rising prices.

However, the local order remains very good. The people are able to comply with the various orders issued by the government. Coastal factories have already been relocated inland and are operating as usual. Over ten thousand unemployed fishermen from the coastal counties of Fuqing, Putian, Hui'an, Jinjiang, and Kinmen have also been relocated by the government to Dehua, Chong'an, Tai'ning, Qingliu, and other counties to engage in farming, and spring plowing has already begun, in order to increase production in the rear. The most regrettable thing is the national

Xiamen University

which has been bombed. On the morning of April 27th, two Japanese planes raided Tingzhou and dropped three bombs on the campus, destroying the principal's office, the general office, all the classrooms in the First Academy, the first-year student dormitory, and the science and chemistry student laboratories. Fortunately, the teachers and students heard the air raid siren and moved to a safe area, so there were no casualties. Classes have been temporarily suspended to deal with the aftermath. After the university was converted into a national university, the Ministry of Education appointed Sa Benxi as the principal. At the end of 1937, the university was relocated to Tingzhou, using the Confucius Temple, the largest building in Tingzhou, as its campus. In the summer of 1938, the Ministry of Education allocated 50,000 yuan to requisition nearby private land to expand the buildings. In the spring of this year, another 30,000 yuan was allocated to purchase instruments and paintings. Currently, there are three colleges: Arts, Science, and Engineering, with over seven hundred students. Located in the central area of the Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces, it is the most complete university in southern China after the outbreak of the war. Its destruction is a major cultural loss. (5th and 6th)

### Japanese Troops on the Jinpu Railway Line in Panic; Puppet Troops in Huaiyuan and Bengbu Revolt; Chinese Troops Attack Train in Guzhen; Anti-British Propaganda on the Bengbu-Mingguang Road

Bengbu Dispatch: Over a thousand puppet troops stationed in Huaiyuan recently revolted, unwilling to be driven by the Japanese. They killed several Japanese military officers and lured and killed over a hundred Japanese soldiers. They have established contact with the Chinese army to sabotage Japanese transportation. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese troops in Bengbu dispatched a team to pursue them, encountering strong resistance from the revolting puppet troops. The fighting was fierce. Upon hearing the news, a Chinese army unit rushed to their aid. According to reports, the Japanese troops in Bengbu, alarmed by the revolt of the puppet troops under Lu Jiayun and the thousand or so puppet troops previously stationed in Huaiyuan, are now closely monitoring the puppet troops under their command. Civilian boats on the Huai River are also not allowed to pass. The Japanese troops in Hefei, under continuous attack, have tightly closed the city gates, prohibiting entry and exit.

The Jinpu and Longhai railways are frequently sabotaged by guerrilla units. A certain Chinese army unit stationed in northern Anhui learned that a Japanese military train was departing from north of Bengbu, so they ambushed it near Xiangshan on the Jinpu Railway (between Guzhen and Suxian), damaging a section of the railway tracks. At 7:30 a.m. on the 28th, a military train arrived, and three cars derailed and overturned. The Chinese troops ambushing the train launched a concentrated attack on the Japanese train, destroying one locomotive and five cars. The Japanese troops, in panic, engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. Subsequently, another Japanese military train arrived, along with five armored vehicles, to provide reinforcements. They launched a fierce artillery barrage to encircle and attack the Chinese army. The Chinese army, having completed its mission, fought bravely to break out of the encirclement. A large number of Japanese troops were killed in this battle.

In Mingguang County, on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, a high-ranking Japanese military officer held a meeting on the 29th of last month, saying, "To conquer China, we must first eliminate the guerrillas. We have now gathered two thousand troops from the Jinpu Line, who will advance in two routes, one from Chuxian towards Lai'an, and the other from Bengbu towards Wuhe." Along the Bengbu-Mingguang Railway, posters with slogans such as "Down with England" were plastered everywhere.

### Foreign Ships Repeatedly Robbed; Japanese Seize Foreign Ships as War Booty; British Warships to Escort Merchant Ships Starting This Month

Shantou Dispatch: Shantou is currently the only commercial port in South China. After the start of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance, domestic and foreign goods all use Shantou as their main hub. The four or five foreign ships entering and leaving Shantou every day have aroused the jealousy of the Japanese. Since mid-April, Japanese warships have suddenly increased in the waters off Fujian and Guangdong, probing the defenses of Shanwei, Jieshi, and Chao'yang River ferry. They repeatedly attempted to land, but all failed. They retaliated against foreign ships and foreign businessmen. In half a month, twelve ships, including the British ship Seges and the Norwegian ship Dahlia, which were sailing along the Hong Kong-Shantou-Quanzhou-Fuzhou line, were robbed and taken to Magong Port in Taiwan. This has caused those in Chaozhou and Shantou evacuating the population and the propertied class, who want to avoid going to Hong Kong, to be very cautious when boarding foreign ships, and they dare not carry too many clothes, books, or newspapers with them. It is reported that passengers on the Seges, which was taken to Taiwan last month, were subjected to military interrogation. Several passengers wearing gray Zhongshan suits were accused of being artillerymen and have been detained to this day. The Norwegian ship Xinsheng sailed from Shantou to Hong Kong on April 25th, suddenly disappeared en route, and there has been no news of it. It has recently been confirmed that it was also captured by Japanese warships and taken to Magong Port in Taiwan. There are currently more than ten Japanese warships in Magong Port, monitoring the captured foreign ships, treating them as war booty, and intending to convert them into transport ships. On April 29th, the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Kunming, sailing from Hong Kong to Shantou, was intercepted by a Japanese patrol ship off the coast of Mayu, which sent troops to board the ship and search it arbitrarily. On April 30th, the Ewo Company's Taisheng, sailing from Hong Kong to Shantou, was forced to stop for inspection by a Japanese warship as it was about to enter Mayu. Seeing that the Japanese warship was fully armed and approaching aggressively, the ship sent a telegram to the British warship in Shantou for assistance. The British warship Aylmer sailed out to provide escort, using armed force against armed force. The Japanese warship then released the Taisheng to enter the port. The passengers on board had already been frightened. The newspapers from Hong Kong being transported to Shantou by the Kunming were all burned by the Japanese, who accused them of being anti-Japanese materials. Without armed protection, it is difficult for British ships to operate safely along the coast of southern China. Last month, all shipping companies were ordered to equip their merchant ships sailing to Southeast Asia and the coast of China with cannons for self-defense at the Taikoo Dockyard & Engineering Company and the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock. It is also reported that Rear Admiral Noble, commander of the British Far East Fleet, has been ordered to rename the 8th Destroyer Flotilla stationed in the Far East as the 21st Destroyer Escort Flotilla. Starting from May 1st, a red line will be added above the two white lines on the funnels as a new marking to identify protected merchant ships. The British destroyer docked in Shantou has already painted the red line on its funnel, indicating that it is shouldering a new responsibility.

### Jiangyin Liyong Textile Mill Refuses to Cooperate with Japan; Japanese Side Makes Demands; Most Shareholders Disapprove

Jiangyin Dispatch: Jiangyin Liyong Textile Mill was established in the 34th year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty with a total of 7,200 shares, equivalent to 1,008,000 national currency. It has 17,000 spindles, producing Nine Lions yarn, which is sold throughout the country. Its business is thriving, and it has accumulated over 162,000 yuan in public reserve funds. After the shareholders' meeting held on March 21, 1937, the factory site fell into enemy hands in April when the War of Resistance broke out. Business was suspended, warehouses were destroyed, the environment deteriorated, and labor and capital were trapped. The approximate losses have reached over 800,000 yuan. Last March, the Japanese Daikang Company sent Yamamoto, Shirota, and others to Jiangyin to seize the factory, hiring workers to repair it, and repeatedly lured the chairman of the board of directors, Shen Lianfang, to cooperate. After repeated meetings of the board of directors, no concrete decision was made. The Japanese side started production on the 5th of this month. The board of directors held two shareholders' meetings at its Shanghai office on Guangdong Road. On March 11th, only 59 households, accounting for 2,460 shares, attended, which was less than the quorum. The meeting was changed to a discussion. Chairman Shen Lianfang attended and gave a detailed report. After the shareholders present studied the matter, the three points of rejection, abandonment, and cooperation were discussed for a long time, without a decision being reached. On the 7th of this month, another shareholders' meeting was convened, with 58 households and 2,608 shares in attendance, which was still less than the quorum. Chairman Shen did not attend, and supervisor Wu Tinglu represented him. The shareholders discussed for a long time, but no decision was made. Generally speaking, no one approved of cooperation, and most still held a wait-and-see attitude.

### Residents of Tancheng Fiercely Attack Passing Japanese Troops; Ambush and Outflank Attack Leads to Over 200 Japanese Casualties

Xuzhou Dispatch: Tancheng is a major thoroughfare on the Taiwei Highway in southern Shandong. Japanese troops from Jiaodong often pass through Tancheng when operating in southern Shandong, and they often engage in lewdness and looting. Therefore, the residents of the area usually dare not live in the city and are scattered around. Various organizations for resistance and self-defense are everywhere. In early October, Japanese troops from Jiaodong reinforced southern Shandong, with Zhuangtian's unit comprising five to six hundred infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other troops. They passed through Tancheng via Linpu Zhao and were planning to advance from southern Tan the next morning. At the time, the magistrate of Tancheng, seeing an opportunity to take advantage of the Japanese troops passing through, supervised the county's regular troops (whose forces were all in the countryside) and the anti-enemy troops from various districts, gathering a total of seven to eight hundred men, who ambushed south of the county seat, planning to outflank the Japanese troops as soon as they left the south gate. When the Japanese troops arrived, the Chinese troops in the hidden areas suddenly launched an attack. Caught off guard, the Japanese troops engaged in a fierce battle. The Japanese vanguard immediately retreated and launched a counterattack with four or five cannons. For a time, the sound of explosions reverberated through the mountains. The loyal and brave Chinese soldiers calmly responded and engaged in a bloody melee. From morning to noon, the fierce fighting lasted for seven hours. Over a hundred Chinese soldiers heroically sacrificed their lives, and the Japanese suffered over two hundred casualties. Finally, the Chinese troops, running low on ammunition, withdrew to a safe area. The Japanese troops then retreated back to Tancheng, not daring to advance south, and left a portion of their forces to defend the city walls. The Chinese regular troops have now established contact with a certain large army unit and are preparing to attack Tancheng again.

### Five Chinese Kidnapped by Japanese Inside Fulaile Restaurant; Jiang Hao and Su Liangru Among the Five; Apparently Betrayed by Pro-Japanese Elements

According to the English-language "Da Mei Evening News," it was revealed today (10th) that yesterday afternoon, ten armed Japanese, guided by two Chinese, in three cars with Shanghai Defense Army permits, went to the Fulaile Jewish Restaurant at No. 159 Guangxi Road and kidnapped five Chinese. It is reported from reliable sources that among these five Chinese are: (1) Jiang Hao, a member of the Shanghai New Life Movement; (2) Su Liangru, the chief of staff of the Pudong Guerrilla Force; (3) Chen Jiamo, the magistrate of Baoshan County, appointed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, who secretly planned to undermine the Japanese-appointed Baoshan County magistrate who only worked in that small city and the Japanese army patrolling the main roads; (4) Wu Chuiying, the former head of the Jiangwan Chamber of Commerce. The names of the other two Chinese are not yet known, but it is generally suspected that one of them is a pro-Japanese element who "sold out" his four friends to the Japanese authorities. The Japanese authorities planned the arrest without notifying the Shanghai Municipal Police of the Public Concession. Only after the Japanese kidnapped the five Chinese in two groups did the police receive the news of an armed kidnapping. Four of those kidnapped went to the restaurant shortly before noon and entered Room 4, which had been reserved by phone the day before. It is believed that one of these four is a pro-Japanese element who lured his friends in. As soon as they entered the Jewish restaurant, ten Japanese arrived in three cars with egg-shaped Shanghai Defense Army permits. When the waiter wanted to guide them into the dining room, the Japanese did not say a word and went straight upstairs, peering into the rooms through the door curtains. The waiter thought they were visiting friends, so he did not suspect anything. A few minutes later, two Chinese talked to them and led them into Room 4. It was heard that the Japanese were all holding guns when they entered the room, and then handcuffed everyone in the room and took them out. However, the waiter still did not know that they were being kidnapped, because the handcuffs were covered by long sleeves, and the Japanese had also hidden their guns in their bags. The kidnapped Chinese did not resist and followed a Chinese wearing black glasses into the car and drove away. However, two Japanese returned to Room 4. About twenty minutes later, at about 1:30 PM, another Chinese entered the restaurant, unaware of what had happened twenty minutes earlier, and was caught in the trap and arrested. The two Japanese dragged the Chinese out in front of the restaurant employees. The restaurant immediately reported to the police, but the police arrived too late, and the fifth Chinese was also kidnapped to Hongkou.

### Female Spy Executed and Displayed to the Public; Japanese Army Trucks Drive into the Huangpu River

Japanese soldiers under the command of Nishimura, the captain of the Japanese garrison on Lincoln Road in western Shanghai, often disguise themselves as villagers or workers and patrol back and forth along Hongqiao Road and Qinghu Road in western Shanghai. Recently, they have been using ignorant women to inquire everywhere. At about 11 AM the day before yesterday, a middle-aged woman in her thirties went to Dujia Alley in the west of Qibao Town and asked for the address of Yao Youlian (the former captain of the Second Direct Brigade). She was discovered by the guerrillas lurking in the countryside, who suspected her behavior and detained her. After Zhu, the brigade commander, repeatedly questioned her severely, she finally revealed the truth. According to her confession, her name was He Wangshi, 35 years old, from Kunshan. She used to have an affair with He Jinfa, a policeman in Chengjiaqiao on Hongqiao Road, who is now a puppet policeman on Lincoln Road. Because the woman knew Mr. and Mrs. Yao when she was in Chengjiaqiao, she was deceived by the Japanese, falsely claiming to visit. It was all false. After Zhu, the brigade commander, obtained the confession, he was extremely angry and tied the woman, He Wangshi, to Qinghu Road for execution. Also, yesterday (9th) evening, a large Japanese military truck loaded with a large amount of military supplies and ammunition, escorted by four Japanese military police, was planning to go to Wusong. Unexpectedly, when it drove to the edge of the Wusong River, it overturned into the Huangpu River due to the dim street lights. One driver and four military police were drowned. The loss of military supplies is estimated to be more than 100,000 yuan.

### Chinese Newspaper Editors Attend Municipal Council Meeting; It is a Meeting of Friendly Nature; All Parties Hope to Work Together; However, Japanese Pressure on the Municipal Council is Quite Tight

According to the Continental News, the foreign publishers and editors-in-chief of Chinese newspapers in the Public Concession are scheduled to attend a meeting in the office of Chairman Finkler of the Municipal Council Building at 9:00 AM today (10th). At that time, Finkler plans to explain the heavy burden of the situation here. Yesterday, it was learned that the attitude expressed by several newspapers proves that the foreign publishers and their editors did not fully understand the true purpose of the notice issued by the Municipal Council on Friday, requesting foreign Chinese newspapers to refrain from publishing speeches or declarations related to the Sino-Japanese war. It is heard that the police and the Municipal Council officials do not believe that these publications are disregarding the notice with a purely uncooperative spirit. According to general opinion, their attitude may cause national disputes.

Yesterday, it was learned from reliable sources that one of the demands made by the Japanese authorities here to crack down on anti-Japanese news in Chinese newspapers is that the Municipal Council establish a news censorship office in the Public Concession by using its police power. However, the Municipal Council is very unwilling to establish such an agency. According to the notice issued by the police on Friday, it did not request the newspapers to stop publishing all speeches or declarations related to the Sino-Japanese war, but requested that such texts be submitted to the Special Branch before publication. Most newspapers did not comply with this request. The Japanese authorities' clear determination to crack down on anti-Japanese news reached its current peak on Monday, when Colonel Kanaya, the head of the Japanese military police, Lieutenant Commander Mitsunobu, the head of the naval press, and Saka, the police chief of the Japanese Consulate, visited Police Commissioner Bowen of the Public Concession and Robert Schumann, the acting head of the Special Branch, to request the arrest of anti-Japanese news reporters and their imprisonment. Sources familiar with the situation believe that unless the situation improves, the Japanese authorities are bound to make further demands, accusing the Municipal Council and the police of being "insincere." Sources familiar with the situation also feel that the Japanese are determined to take unilateral action, disregarding the police and the Municipal Council.

It is also heard that although the publishers of foreign Chinese newspapers enjoy consular jurisdiction, the Municipal Council is completely free to deal with such publications. After the Police Special Branch issued the Municipal Council notice and ordered the American Chinese Morning Post to cease publication, it did not cause any dispute. As for Chinese-owned newspapers, they do not participate in such discussions because such publications are subject to Japanese censorship, which relieves the police of all responsibility. The status of Western newspapers was not included in the consultation. Also, according to the English "Da Mei Evening News," thirteen Chinese and foreign editors of foreign Chinese newspapers attended a secret meeting at the Municipal Council this morning (10th) to discuss the problems encountered by both the Municipal Council and the newspapers. This was only a meeting of a friendly nature, with no records taken, and was the first such meeting. It was clarified during the meeting that newspapers are not currently subject to censorship, but all parties hope to cooperate in order to avoid the use of compulsory measures.

### Crushed Wheat on the De Ping Still Not Unloaded; Japanese Navy Spokesperson Says Not in Favor of Navigation Between Shanghai and Ningbo

According to the Continental News, the Japanese navy spokesperson denied the rumor that 300 bags of crushed wheat from the American Red Cross on the Italian ship De Ping had been confiscated when he met with reporters yesterday (9th). It is learned that the De Ping was carrying a large amount of supplies for refugees and was detained by the Japanese navy on April 27 en route to Ningbo and escorted back to Shanghai. In addition to the goods, it was also carrying foreign doctors and nurses going to the interior of China. The passengers were immediately released, and soon most of the goods were also released. The ship is still carrying 300 bags of wheat and is being detained here. According to the Japanese navy spokesperson, the owner can ship out the crushed wheat at any time, but it is rumored that the De Ping will still sail to Ningbo, so the owner decided to leave the wheat on the ship. When asked whether the De Ping would be allowed to sail to Ningbo, the spokesperson replied that the Japanese authorities do not approve of navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo and that whether the ship sails to Ningbo or not is up to the Italian ship owner to decide.

### Encouraging the Withholding of Income Tax; Extending the Deadline for Rewards; Expediting Applications; Still Valid

The Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance stipulated that income tax bonuses should be applied for by withholders by filling out an application form to the local competent collection agency within 15 days after each semi-annual settlement. All withholding bonuses for the 25th and 26th years that have not been applied for are now overdue. In order to encourage withholding, special accommodation is allowed to extend the deadline. In addition to changing the deadline for bonus applications to within two months after each semi-annual settlement starting from this year, those who are currently expediting application procedures for the withholding bonuses for the 26th and 27th years are still valid. A notice has been sent to various industries to follow. According to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, according to Article 30 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, withholders of income tax who can complete their withholding duties in accordance with legal procedures and deadlines may be given a bonus of 5 per mille of the withheld tax amount by the local competent collection agency. According to Article 27 of the same Detailed Rules, the scope of withheld income tax is salary income tax and interest income tax.

### Celebration Meeting of Italian Bridge

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that the Italian community in Shanghai celebrated the third anniversary of the founding of the Italian Empire last night from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM at the Italian Club.

According to reports, after Italy annexed Abyssinia in 1936, the Fascist Party celebrated the anniversary of the founding of the Empire on May 9th.

### After Strict Enforcement of Price Limits, the Rice Market Becomes Stable; Major Dealers Sell Off, Market Supply and Demand Responds Accordingly; Registration of Rice Stock Owners Begins Tomorrow

After the Bean and Rice Market Management Committee strictly enforced price limits to maintain the people's food supply, major dealers have sold off their stocks, and the market situation is gradually returning to normal. Market prices are gradually stabilizing. The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee issued a notice to handle the registration of rice stock owners for review and processing, and plans to send letters to the authorities of the two concessions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce tomorrow, inviting them to send representatives to participate. Details are as follows:

Enforcement of Price Limits, Price Stabilization

The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee resolved to strictly enforce price limits and strongly urged dealers and merchants from all regions to consider the overall situation and purchase as much as possible from the producing areas. The bean and rice market opened as usual at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The Director of the Market Management Committee, Fu Qiangeng, personally persuaded and facilitated the sources of supply and reported the results of the third resolution of the Evaluation Committee on strictly enforcing price limits. Most of the major dealers accepted the advice and sold off their stocks, and market supply and demand responded accordingly. Except for the highest-grade white rice and the "Ke Xian" rice, which remained at the price limit of fifteen yuan, all other mid-grade varieties fell back in price. Therefore, rice prices stabilized yesterday.

Rice Stock Registration Begins Tomorrow

In order to handle the registration of rice stock owners, the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee drafted a notice yesterday and posted it in the market, stating that since its establishment, the committee has worked with various rice industry groups to stabilize rice and grain market prices and has been conducting surveys of rice stock quantities, preparing lists and statistics on a regular basis, and reporting to the concession authorities for investigation and to maintain the people's food supply. It was decided at a meeting on the 9th of this month to handle the registration of rice stock owners. All rice stock owners must collect forms from the Bean and Rice Industry Association at 15 Edward Road from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily from the 12th to the 18th of this month and register according to the form for review and processing. Otherwise, the matter will be reported to the concession authorities for handling. This matter concerns the entire food supply of Shanghai. It is hoped that all stock owners will consider the overall situation and comply with the registration requirements without delay. This is a special announcement.

Letters Sent to Inform Affiliated Businesses

In addition to the market notice regarding the registration of rice stock owners, the committee also sent letters to relevant rice industry groups to inform their affiliated businesses for the sake of speed. The original letter is recorded below: (Above omitted, see market notice) for review and processing. Otherwise, it will be reported to the concession authorities for handling. In addition to publishing the announcement in the newspaper and announcing it in the market, a letter is prepared and sent to you, requesting that you investigate and quickly inform your affiliated businesses that all those with rice and grain stocks must register within the specified time limit. This is the sincere expectation. The Bean and Rice Industry Association also sent letters to affiliated businesses yesterday, stating that it received a letter from the Shanghai Rice Industry Group Evaluation Committee (middle part omitted, see market announcement). In view of this, since this matter concerns the entire food supply of Shanghai, it should be handled accordingly. All fellow traders with rice and grain stocks must come to register within the prescribed time limit. This is a special announcement.

Letter Requesting Authorities to Send Representatives to Participate

Since its establishment, the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee has actively conducted investigations into the city's grain reserves. The first to sixth phases have been successively concluded. Recently, due to restrictions on the export of rice and grain from the producing areas and the levying of miscellaneous taxes and levies, merchants are unable to make a profit and are unwilling to move forward. The source of rice and grain has decreased, and because of manipulation by major dealers, they hoarded and stockpiled, causing the market situation to be chaotic and exceeding the price limits. In addition to strictly enforcing penalties, the committee believes that the responsibility is significant and relies on relevant groups to discuss it together. It has been decided to send letters to the two concession authorities and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce tomorrow, inviting them to send representatives to participate and provide guidance.

### Guerrilla Forces Attack Shenzhuang and Chenxing; Fierce Fighting Continues in Southern Pudong; More Than 4,000 Japanese and Puppet Troops Attack Fan Gencai's Defense Zone; Fan's Troops Avoid Strength and Attack the Two Towns Simultaneously

Fan Gencai's troops of the Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army in southern Pudong, known as the Guerrilla Iron Army, are a thorn in the side of the Japanese army. Fan's troops are widely regarded as a formidable enemy. Since last month, the Japanese army has been using bandits and puppets organized by the national traitor Zhang Miaogen and using ethnic liberation miscellaneous troops who failed to understand the lured benefits, forming large bandit puppets of three or four thousand people, together with more than 1,000 Japanese troops, actively attacking the various defense areas of Fan Gencai. At that time, Fan Gencai thought that this was not an urgent task of guerrilla warfare, so he implemented decentralization.

Attack on Shenzhuang

On the evening of the 6th, the advanced cadres of Fan Gencai, Zhou Mingfa, and Pan Yi, etc., convened a military meeting with He Xingjian, commander of the First Column of the Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army of the Su-Zhe Action Committee specially dispatched by the Central Government, and Ding Xisan, commander of the Eighth Detachment. At 2:00 AM, Fan Gencai personally commanded the First, Third, and Fourth Squads to attack Shenzhuang, and fierce fighting began in the northeast suburbs of the town, lasting for two hours. The Japanese and puppet troops were defeated and retreated, and the guerrilla forces occupied the town, seizing more than 50 rifles, one light and heavy machine gun each, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, killing five Japanese soldiers and more than 40 puppet soldiers.

Great Victory at Chenxing

At the same time, the Fifth Squad of Cao Youmin and the reserve battalion of Weng attacked Chenjiahang. At that time, they encountered the main force of the Japanese and puppet troops in the town. The Japanese army was heavily armed on the front, and the Weng troops feigned an attack on their left flank. Cao Youmin, the commander of the Cao squad, personally led his Fifth Squad to detour to Tangkou and carried out a flanking attack. Five Japanese and puppet sentries were captured alive in the town and drove straight into the back of Chenxing Town. The Japanese and puppet troops were still stubbornly resisting, and a fierce battle broke out immediately. The two sides fought hand-to-hand repeatedly for three hours. Except for a part of the Japanese and puppet troops surrendering, most of the others were killed, and the bodies were piled up like mountains. In this battle, Song, an aide of the First Battalion of the former Xu Xingzhou troops, and a Japanese military instructor named Xiaocun were captured alive on the battlefield, and eight light and heavy machine guns, eight Mauser pistols, more than 60 rifles, and more than 30,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. The Chinese army triumphantly returned after completing its mission.

Fierce Battle at Nanzhai

Zhang Miaogen, the commander of the puppet army, fled to Zhoupu overnight and reported to Yamada, the commander of the Japanese army headquarters. On the afternoon of the 7th, more than 400 Japanese army and naval personnel were transferred, and the Shanhaixi Maru and a No. 1 gunboat attacked the Fan troops of the Chinese guerrilla forces in Duhang Zagang, searching the area of ​​Nanzhai, four miles north of Lujiahui. Weng Tangming's troops of the reserve battalion of the Fan troops stationed in the area learned the news and preemptively gave them a head-on blow. The Japanese army densely fired small steel cannons and light and heavy machine guns, forming a serious situation. At the same time, the Japanese people were also on alert south of Duhang, and forced civilians to guide them. The Weng troops sent a flyer to the brigade headquarters to report the military situation and took an encirclement formation, launching a fierce attack. The war was launched. At the same time, Min Gang, the commander of the First Squad, Hong Guanbing, the commander of the Third Squad, and Cao Youmin, the commander of the Fifth Squad, who were stationed in the south, heard the news and reinforced them, and the battle was fierce. The Japanese army was attacked from the front and back, so they concentrated their firepower and broke through to the southwest, and collapsed. As a result of this fierce battle, the Fan troops recovered five Type 38 rifles, two smoke bombs, and one Japanese flag abandoned by the Japanese army.

Fengxian Defense

After Li Zhiming, the commander of the Third Detachment of the Guerrilla Forces in Fengxian County, Pudong, resigned, the vacant position was replaced by Gu Shouxin, the commander of the Second Battalion under Yu Taosheng, the commander of the Fourth Detachment, who was transferred by the Commissioner's Office. Gu made outstanding achievements in the counterattack against Zhuqiao last autumn and was transferred to Xinchang. He was only transferred to Fengxian last month and is now guarding the area of ​​Qingcun Port, Nangaocun, the county seat of Fengxian, and the head of the Touqiao Fen Shui Mound. The rumor that the county seat of Fengxian has fallen has not been confirmed.

### Ningbo Suffers Another Bombing; More Than 100 Houses Destroyed and Five People Killed; Goods Become Ruins and Hospitals Move Out of the City

Ningbo was again indiscriminately bombed by Japanese aircraft inside and outside the city on the 9th, causing heavy losses. The situation is recorded as follows:

Bombed Five Times

Since Ningbo was bombed four times by Japanese aircraft on the 28th of last month and the 1st, 2nd, and 6th of this month, the losses have been heavy. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on the 9th, six more Japanese aircraft came and dropped 19 bombs inside and outside Ningbo City. Some of the bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft contained incendiary properties, so fires broke out and spread in several places immediately.

### Damage Situation of Mogan Mountain After Japanese Aircraft Bombing; A Small Number of Men, Women, and Children Injured; Significant Damage to Industries on the Mountain

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that Beckman, secretary of the Mogan Mountain Summer Resort Association, received a letter from Mogan Mountain Nohut stating that the Japanese aircraft bombed Mogan Mountain on the 5th of this month, resulting in a small number of men, women, and children being injured, and significant damage to industries. The Shanghai Municipal Council's sanatorium was also among them. According to reports, this letter was sent to Huzhou by someone to be mailed, and was received here this (10th) morning.

### Moufu Arrives Safely in Wenzhou; Inspected on the Ocean Surface; Hanna Rescheduled to Sail to Dinghai Today; No News of Ende's Return to Shanghai

The German merchant Lihe Company's Moufu sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the morning of the 9th of this month. When sailing through the Daji Ocean, it was ordered to anchor by a Japanese warship. Japanese naval personnel boarded the ship to conduct a full ship inspection and inspected the sailing license. The inspection lasted two hours before it was completed. The ship restarted and proceeded and arrived safely in Wenzhou at 3:00 PM on the 10th. After the passengers and goods were unloaded, it returned to Shanghai.

Hanna Sails to Dinghai

The second shift of the German merchant Far East Company's Hanna after returning to Shanghai on its first voyage to Dinghai was originally scheduled to sail to Dinghai on the evening of the 8th. However, because the import procedures for shipping in Dinghai were extremely strict, staff were left in Dinghai to negotiate. It has now been completed. The ship has been approved to be rescheduled to sail to Dinghai at 4:00 PM today (11th). The Feikang of Lulin Company and the Haifu of Lihe Company are also planning to sail directly from Shanghai to Wenzhou this morning (11th).

Ende Safe and Sound

The Ende of the Italian merchant Sino-Italian Company has been stranded in the Oujiang River after sailing directly from Shanghai to Wenzhou. When reporters inquired with the company, they said that no telegrams had arrived in Shanghai, and it was difficult to determine when it would return south. The reason for its stay in Wenzhou is related to freight transportation and there are no other accidents. In addition, the Nanning, which was traveling to Wenzhou to load goods for Taikoo Company, arrived at the port at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The next shift will depart from Shanghai to Tianjin.

Ningbo-Shaoxing Remittance

Regarding the remittance between Shaoxing and Ningbo and their nearby postal areas, such as Yuyao, Shangyu, Wufu, Baiguan, Cao'e, Taizhou, Wenzhou, Fenghua, and Cixi, the postal remittance office has received a telegram report from the Zhejiang Postal Administration that it can restore the original state. Therefore, from now on, there is no restriction on opening drafts for remittances to Ningbo and Shaoxing. However, the remittance fee is still charged at two cents per yuan. In addition, regarding the remittance from Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Yantai, and Jinan to Shanghai, the Shanghai Postal Remittance Bureau limits the exchange to 300 yuan per day. If the amount of the draft is 300 yuan, only 100 yuan will be exchanged on the same day, and the remaining 200 yuan will be paid successively the next day.

### Japanese Warships Obstruct Tonghe's Loading of Pigs; British Warships Arrive to Protect; Another Batch of Fresh Pigs Arriving in Shanghai Was Detained Yesterday; Fellow Traders in the Fresh Pig Industry Decided to Stand Firm

The fresh pig industry stands firm on the detention of fresh pigs and waits for the concession authorities to handle the aftermath. The Tonghe was loading pigs to transport to Shanghai and was obstructed by Japanese warships in Xingang. The British warships arrived to release the ship to Shanghai. Details are as follows:

Pig Industry Struggle Reaches Its Peak

The number of live pigs intercepted and forcibly bought by the fresh pig industry for days has been more than a thousand. Yesterday, the Japanese ship Yanzi Maru brought 287 fresh pigs, which were also bought by the Hongkou "Shanghai Livestock Market." It is heard that the fresh pig industry is very angry, but there is nothing they can do. The industry's self-struggle has been sympathized by the society and is probably at its saturation point. After that, the problems related to the entire economic structure must wait for the responsible authorities of the concession to handle the aftermath. However, the fresh pig industry is determined to adhere to its original position.

Japanese Warships Obstruct Tonghe's Loading of Pigs

The British merchant Jardine Matheson's Tonghe loaded 500 live pigs from north of the Yangtze River and sailed to Shanghai. When sailing in Xingang, it was suddenly detained by a Japanese destroyer. After the Japanese naval personnel boarded the ship, they interrogated the owner and ordered the ship to unload the goods and not transport the pigs to Shanghai. At that time, the owner of the Tonghe refused the interrogation of the Japanese side and ordered the assistant to quickly deliver an official document to HMS Scorpion of the British Yangtze River Fleet to report. When the British gunboat sailed to the location where the Tonghe was detained, the owner of the Tonghe was negotiating with the captain of the Japanese destroyer, and the Japanese immediately released it. The ship still sailed to Shanghai as usual and arrived at the Shanghai Flower Garden Pier at 12:30 PM yesterday.

### Anti-Epidemic Teams of the Anti-Epidemic Society Sent to Dinghai for Work

In addition to working hard in the city, the members of the anti-epidemic teams organized by the Chinese Anti-Epidemic Society and sent to Dinghai, led by Mr. Sun Liqing, will assist the Dinghai Public Hospital and go to various inland towns in Ningbo to carry out anti-epidemic work. In order to publicize and promote the anti-epidemic work, the society is seeking songwriters from all walks of life to compile anti-epidemic songs. In order to facilitate the poor and sick, it is also seeking philanthropists and the medical community to jointly run free clinics. It is hoped that those who have free clinics will send their addresses to the society at 251 Xinzha Road so that the addresses of the society's clinics can be published in the newspaper on May 15th.

### Comparing to the Belgian Free Press, The Exchange News in the Guerrilla Area, Although Simple in Form, Should Also Have Everything, Aims to Inspire Civilians and Add Color to the Press

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that when Germany occupied Belgium, Belgium secretly published the famous "Free Belgium Newspaper" every day. Now, the "Exchange News," which is widely circulated in the Pudong guerrilla area, is the Nanhui Daily, which provides the public with current war news from the Chinese perspective. The newspaper is blue mimeographed, with a total of four pages, 15 inches long and 10 and a half inches wide.

Advertisements and Reviews

are all available, and there is also a literary page that publishes patriotic novels and Japanese soldiers' diaries that prove the declining morale of the Japanese army. The newspaper has no address, only Nanhui Publishing is listed. The reviewers are presumably members of the propaganda team of the Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army. The most recent issue to arrive in Shanghai was Issue 197, published on April 24, priced at one cent per copy. Although there is no direct supply of news from foreign news agencies, the newspaper also publishes news from the Haitong News Agency and the Havas News Agency, which is heard that the newspaper's editors

News Broadcast

received from the report. The local news page contains a news item stating that a Japanese armed fishing boat ran aground on the coast of Nanhui on April 23. The guerrillas attacked it, and the Japanese fishermen were killed and injured in a fierce battle for one hour. The newspaper is apparently published outside the city of Nanhui, in an area nominally occupied by the Japanese. The mimeograph and radio are the only

available equipment

to publish the newspaper and inspire civilians. This is the characteristic of the Chinese guerrilla forces. When the German army occupied Belgium, Belgium also had a newspaper of the same nature, which won immortal fame, namely the "Free Belgium Newspaper," which was secretly published every day. Moreover, this kind of newspaper was sent to the German army headquarters. Although several editors sacrificed their lives for this, the newspaper continued to be published.

### New Tea From Various Places Comes on the Market and Concentrates in Hong Kong for Export; In Order to Improve Quality and Enhance Reputation, Inspection Standards and Punishment Methods Are Promulgated

After the Trade Commission managed the national tea sales, in order to improve quality, enhance reputation, and expand the market, the competent authorities promulgated measures for violating tea industry inspection standards and corresponding punishments. Now, new tea leaves from various places have come on the market. Domestic tea is allowed to be sold and transported internally according to the law after foreign exchange is settled, while export tea is concentrated in Hong Kong for export. The details are as follows:

New Tea on the Market, Implementation of Management

The Qihong of Anhui, the Ninghong of Jiangxi, the Wenhong of Zhejiang, the Hubeihong of Hunan and Hubei, the Jianhong of Fujian, as well as the Pingshui Tea of ​​Zhejiang, the Luzhuang green tea of ​​Anhui, the Wulong, and Longjing tea of ​​Huzhou and Hangzhou, have been listed one after another. Tea farmers have been picking and manufacturing them in groups. However, after the national tea leaves, the Free Trade Commission, and other management agencies have been effective in managing the tea, the agencies will continue to implement management this year. (1) Export tea is required to be concentrated in Hong Kong for export and is absolutely prohibited from being transported to Shanghai. (2) Domestic tea is required to be freely transported, but foreign exchange must be settled according to law.

Improve Quality and Enhance Reputation

The Tea Inspection Office issued a notice due to the launch of new tea, stating that tea inspection was originally intended to improve quality, enhance reputation, and expand the market. Tea merchants who understand this meaning, process and manufacture without any carelessness, and meet the inspection standards are numerous. However, there are also not a few who seek immediate private interests and produce crudely. Such tea merchants are obviously destroying regulations and hindering the sales of the entire Chinese tea. If they are not strictly cracked down, the future of Chinese tea will be greatly affected. For this reason, the admonition is reiterated. Those who do not comply will be punished according to law and will never be lenient. It is hoped that all tea merchants will abide by the regulations and not go far away. This is a special announcement.

Punishment Measures for Violating Inspection

Punishment measures for violating tea inspection standards: (1) Domestic tea is absolutely not allowed to be colored. If export tea uses colorants, the principle is to use light and non-toxic substances. Those with excessive coloring and toxic substances will be confiscated and destroyed. (2) Tea leaves that are under-stirred or baked, or are wet during handling, have been stored for a long time and are moldy, have no fragrance, are cloudy in color, and hinder hygiene will be confiscated and destroyed. (3) Tea leaves mixed with fake leaves or other impurities that are harmful to hygiene will be confiscated and destroyed. (4) Tea leaves that are over-baked and have a heavy burnt taste will be confiscated and destroyed. (5) If the moisture content is too high and exceeds the regulations, an order will be issued to re-manufacture. (6) If there is too much powder (excluding tea powder) and it exceeds the regulations, an order will be issued to re-manufacture. (7) If there are too many tea stalks (excluding tea stalks) and it exceeds the regulations, an order will be issued to re-select. (8) If the packaging does not meet the regulations, an order will be issued to re-manufacture.

### Sausage Industry Group in This City Establishes Sausage Industry Federation

The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Sausage Industry Federation issued a notice on the establishment of the Sausage Industry Federation, stating that since the establishment of the Fresh Sausage Industry Businessmen Association on December 27, 1937, fellow traders in our industry have had the opportunity to unite. Before long, other groups appeared, and small and weak colleagues suffered from the pain of business monopoly. Therefore, the partnership discrimination, the Chinese and foreign gap, is quite amazing. At this extraordinary time, it is appropriate to detain people and be hungry like oneself. The past selfish manipulation must be broken. As the saying goes, everyone eats when there is food, so the Shanghai Sausage Industry Federation is produced. The environment makes it so. The association does not distinguish between Chinese and foreign manufacturers and partners. All those who belong to the same industry can join and strive for public welfare. Those who agree with this intention are welcome to come.

### Employer Delegation Departs to Attend the International Labor Conference

The 25th International Labor Conference this year is scheduled to be held in Geneva next month. Representatives from various countries have left separately to attend. The National Government's employer delegation has been jointly recommended by the China National Industries Federation and the National Business Federation to appoint Mr. Wang as the representative and Mr. Xu as the consultant. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has approved the appointment. However, since the conference is approaching, Mr. Xu is currently in London. Mr. Wang has already taken a wheel to Hong Kong to go to Europe to attend. Mr. Xu will transfer from London. The secretary's seat, as well as the government delegation and the labor delegation, have been separately appointed by the central government. Mr. Wang will also carry reports on the state of Chinese industry in recent years and the destruction of factories in various places by the Japanese side during the war, so that they can report to the conference.

### Massive Influx of Japanese Flour into China Affects Shanghai Flour Industry; Monopoly of Wheat in Occupied Areas Forces Shanghai Flour Mills to Order Foreign Wheat

Shanghai aims to be the center of the national flour industry. After the war, the massive influx and dumping of Japanese flour led to the seizure of the North China market. At the same time, the monopoly of wheat in occupied areas forced Shanghai flour mills to order foreign wheat to be shipped to Shanghai as a relief measure. Details are as follows:

Shanghai as a Center of Flour Production

Flour is one of the staple foods of our people, especially in the North, where it is widely consumed. There are a total of ninety-three mechanized flour mills across the country, scattered throughout various provinces and cities. However, Shanghai is the primary supplier. Of the national mechanized flour exports through treaty ports, Shanghai accounts for 96 percent. Therefore, Shanghai is not only the center of the flour industry in the Yangtze River basin but also the source of flour supply for the entire country. Shanghai has fifteen flour mills, with an annual flour production of 10 million metric tons, accounting for more than half of the national output. After the war, the factories in the occupied areas of Yu were forced to shut down. Only a few, such as Fuxin and Fufeng, managed to operate with great difficulty, and their flour production decreased significantly compared to pre-war levels.

Japanese Flour Imports Dominate North China

After the war, foreign flour took the opportunity to enter and dump into the market. In 1938, 2,547,783 metric tons were imported, valued at 52,985,269 national currency units. In the first quarter of this year, 413,543 metric tons were imported, valued at 7,820,964 national currency units. Japan accounted for the largest share, followed by the United States, Australia, Canada, and others. North China, including Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Qingdao, was traditionally a strong market for Shanghai flour. After the war, the import and dumping of Japanese flour severely impacted the sales of Shanghai flour. The North China flour market was largely taken over by the Japanese. As a result, the northern sales of Shanghai flour decreased daily, and the North China market was flooded with Japanese flour, such as brands like "Green Treasure Ship" and "Green Bamboo Character."

Shanghai Factories Forced to Order Foreign Wheat

The Shanghai flour mills have traditionally relied on Hebei, Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and the outskirts of Shanghai for their raw material wheat supply. Now, due to the Japanese monopoly, they have been forced to order foreign wheat to be shipped to Shanghai as a relief measure. Since January of this year, imports have been phased in. According to customs reports, 1,014,650 metric tons were imported in the first quarter of this year, valued at 8,304,264 national currency units. These all came from the United States and Australia. In contrast, the total wheat imports in 1938 were only 27 metric tons, valued at 611 national currency units. The sharp increase this year is due to the Japanese monopoly of wheat in the producing areas, forcing Shanghai flour mills to order foreign wheat in large quantities.

### Increased Mileage Fees for Trolleybuses and Buses

The Public Utilities Committee and the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council have noted that the prices of building materials have skyrocketed by more than twofold, and that buses have become heavier and larger after most were converted to double-deckers. The current mileage fee is difficult to apply. (According to the agreement between the Bureau and the Trolleybus and Bus Company, buses with pneumatic tires pay 0.0209 national currency units per mile, trackless trolleybuses with solid tires pay 0.02 national currency units per mile, and trackless trolleybuses with pneumatic tires pay 0.077 national currency units per mile. 1.25% of the total mileage fee income is paid to the Bureau as a franchise fee.) Currently, buses, including those being built, weigh 22% more than the original standard buses when carrying half their passenger capacity. Common trackless trolleybuses are lighter than the original standard buses. The average number of passengers on buses has increased from 30 to 58. The Public Utilities Committee and the Board of Directors have therefore decided to increase the original mileage fee by 10%. This mileage fee, along with the various vehicle license surcharges collected last year, plus an additional 10% for buses due to their increased weight and volume, totals 20%. The trolleybus and bus companies have already agreed to this, and it will be implemented on May 1st. The trolleybus company has added a condition that this issue should be reconsidered when the exchange rate is restored to equilibrium. The French Tramway Company will also pay the increased mileage fee for buses operating on the Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch sections.

### Puppet Court to be Abolished

The puppet "Local Court" has been established in the Xicheng Elementary School in the Nanshi area, but it has made no progress. All litigation cases have been seized by the Judicial Office of the puppet municipal government as a way to generate income. Furthermore, the acting president of the court, Fei Guoxi, has been transferred to Wuhu as the president of the puppet local court. Therefore, the court is essentially a shell. Hu Qitai, the puppet Minister of Justice, has seen this and decided to abolish the court to save "public" funds and to show that he is not competing with the puppet Judicial Office.

### Woman Seeks to Dissolve Engagement After Unsuccessful Loan Request - Marriage Should Not Be a Business Transaction

Court Orders Investigation and Further Hearing

Gu Zhenghong, a throat doctor from Huzhou who hangs his sign at the Tianshengtang Pharmacy at 64 Avenue Joffre, is 23 years old. He cured Yin Rongqiu, a 25-year-old Muslim woman from Hubei, of a throat ailment. The two developed a romantic relationship from their friendship. After becoming engaged on March 3rd of last year, the woman suddenly regretted the engagement and sought to dissolve it unsuccessfully. She first sued Gu for physical injury, unlawful detention, and robbery of a gold ring in the First Special District Court.

All Claims Were Dismissed

Later, Yin Rongqiu filed a mediation request for the dissolution of the engagement against Gu Zhenghong in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court. Because the man objected, the mediation failed. Yin Rongqiu has now formally filed a lawsuit, requesting a judgment to dissolve the engagement. These details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. The Second Special District Court approved the request. The case was heard yesterday morning in the Seventh Tribunal by Judge Wu Xiaoke. Both parties appeared with their lawyers. The plaintiff first stated the reasons for the lawsuit, claiming that the defendant had behaved improperly.

Seeks Dissolution Based on Defendant's Character

The defendant promised to support my parents when he first courted me, but he did not fulfill this promise. Instead, he borrowed money from me and gambled at the dog racing track. On March 30th, he robbed me of my gold ring, which I reported to the police, etc. In addition to submitting a defense according to the law, the defendant Gu Zhenghong, through his lawyer Wang Xintang, argued that the plaintiff was a factory worker. The defendant became engaged to her because he thought she was educated. Her uncle is a detective in the police force. He thought his niece was marrying a

Wealthy Husband

and believed it was a good deal. He repeatedly asked for loans unsuccessfully and falsely accused the defendant of robbery. He even used torture against the defendant, which resulted in the defendant being found innocent. When the plaintiff and defendant became engaged, she wrote a note stating that if she changed her mind, it would be like eating pork, etc. He submitted the note for review. After examining the note, the court, finding that the case required further investigation, announced that the hearing would be rescheduled for the 17th.

### Case of Attempted Assassination of Yang Zaisan Concluded Yesterday; Sentencing on the 17th

Yang Zaisan (aka Yang Zaishan) from Changyinsha, Changshu, was shot and nearly killed by Xu Zimao from Siyang at 12:30 PM on April 5th at the entrance of Binyu Lane on Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession for some reason. Xu was apprehended by detectives and taken to the French police station. After investigation, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The lawyer for the French Concession administrative authorities filed a public prosecution based on Article 271, Section 2 of the Criminal Law for attempted murder. Judge Zhang Minsheng repeatedly opened hearings to study the case. According to Xu's confession, Zhou Guoyuan hired me to kill Yang Zaisan for a reward of 300 yuan. It was said that Yang had been a guerrilla commander under Fang Xianren, but later defected and confiscated the assets of Commander Xiong's family in the countryside. Yang was in Shanghai in charge of liaison matters, etc. The court ordered a rescheduled hearing. These details have been reported in previous newspapers. This case was reopened yesterday morning. The defendant Xu Zimao's confession was the same as before. He also confessed that his wife, surnamed Li, brought the gun. Zhou Guoyuan and Li accompanied me to Dongxinqiao to scout Yang's whereabouts and handed me the gun. Zhou then pointed out Yang's face to me, and I shot him from behind, etc. At this point, the court believed that the case was clear and ordered closing arguments. The lawyer for the French Concession administrative authorities, Yuan Jiagou, and the court-appointed public defender for the defendant, Wang Hengyi, debated each other. The court announced the conclusion of the case and scheduled sentencing for the 17th. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### Xu Qizhong Abandoned Woman After Seduction; Woman Sues to Enforce Contract; Mediation Fails, Lawsuit Pending

Xu Guannan, a Ningbo merchant residing in Shanghai, has a son named Qizhong. In the past, Qizhong was extravagant and wasteful, leading to significant debt and a bankruptcy declaration in court. Recently, Xu Qizhong was sued by Sheng Meiying, a 26-year-old local woman (residing at No. 227, Lane 149, 430 Road), through lawyer Cheng Zhengping, for malicious abandonment.

Request for Mediation

and enforcement of the contract. The petition stated that when the petitioner was 18 years old, she was seduced by the respondent due to her youth and naiveté. The respondent made promises of lifelong marriage and enticed the petitioner to leave her family and live with him, leading to the signing of a contract stipulating a monthly allowance of at least 200 yuan in addition to necessary expenses. Initially, they lived in harmony, and their relationship was strong. However, the petitioner recently discovered that the respondent not only

Already Had a Wife

but also cohabited with two women, Chen Hailun and Ke Zhizhen, and engaged in excessive spending. He secretly pawned and sold all of the petitioner's jewelry and personal property. When she slightly displeased him, he would beat and humiliate her, disregarding her livelihood. The respondent's abandonment from beginning to end is clear. Although the petitioner is not educated, she is familiar with basic etiquette. A woman should remain loyal to one man and find peace of mind throughout her life. The petitioner is a weak woman who cannot remarry and struggles to make a living. Moreover, her

Personal Property

has been spent by the respondent. From May 1935 to April of this year, he owes a total of 9,600 yuan in allowance. The lawyer sent a letter of demand, which was ignored. Therefore, the petitioner requests mediation, reserving the pawned money, loans, and future living expenses. The petitioner requests the court to order the respondent to appear in court for mediation to enforce the contract and pay the outstanding

Living Expenses

of 9,600 yuan, etc. The case was heard the other day by Judge Zheng in a special mediation hearing. Sheng Meiying appeared through lawyer Cheng Zhengping, while Xu Qizhong did not appear and also sent a lawyer, stating that Xu Qizhong had previously declared bankruptcy and could not afford to pay living expenses. The court announced the failure of the mediation, and a formal lawsuit is pending.

### Narcotics Seized on Rue de Zikawei; Wedding Invitations Seized Together Leading to Arrest

Ye Yuxi, a Chinese detective chief, and Guo Shouxin, a detective, from the Narcotics Division of the Public Security Bureau, discovered that someone was selling heroin at No. 14, Lane 127, Rue de Zikawei. They secretly arrested Zhu Shaotang, Zhu Wangshi, Lu Abao, Wu Qun, and Zhang Lizhen, a woman, the other day. They seized 27 small packets of heroin, two medium packets of caffeine extract, one packet of white powder, three opium pipes, one pot of opium paste, and opium dross. They were taken to the Xinzha Police Station, where they were detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Li Zhitian, the lawyer for the Police Station, filed a lawsuit according to the law. The defendants' confessions were evasive. Zhang Lizhen confessed that she sang civilized dramas at the New World amusement park and had a close relationship with a tea server named Luo Jinshui. They chose to marry today at the Zhonghua Restaurant on Shilu. The defendants Zhu Shaotang and Zhu Wangshi are her foster parents. Yesterday, they were arrested while delivering wedding invitations. She asked for leniency and presented the wedding invitations to the court. Judge Fu recognized Zhang Lizhen and approved her release on bail with a guarantee of 2,000 yuan. The remaining defendants were held pending sentencing on the 17th.

### Causes of Damage to a Man's Vital Essence

Many men, due to ignorance of hygiene or bad habits, experience a decline in their spirit and sexual function even though they are still young. The so-called "kidney deficiency" is a sign of premature aging. Young men should be full of vitality, so there should be no such problems. However, due to the effects of masturbation and indulgence, their sexual power gradually declines, and they cannot exert their healthy sexual power. This is the phenomenon of kidney deficiency.

If this unfortunate phenomenon occurs in middle age, it is due to physiological decline, leading to the aging of the sexual glands. For the average healthy male, the sexual glands are at their most prosperous around the age of 20. By middle age, they have reached the end of their strength and are no longer capable. However, if one does not take care of oneself, this kind of disease may break out even before middle age, which is a great tragedy in life.

Therefore, if the essence of the sexual glands (i.e., the testicles) of a strong animal can be replenished into the human body, it can promote its prosperity, relieve its premature decline, and restore its inherent sexual power, thus achieving rejuvenation. This is the latest invention of modern medicine: sexual gland therapy.

For example, a 40-year-old who feels that his energy is declining can delay the occurrence of the above-mentioned harm for another ten years through this therapy. The therapeutic results have been clinically proven.

The use of sexual gland essence preparations for men, such as "Bouti Kang," in organ therapy has a long history. We doctors have accurately identified its medicinal power. The effects begin in one hour, and the kidneys are nourished within 24 hours. It has several major functions: invigorating the nerves and nourishing the kidneys, blood, and brain. Whether the patient's illness is premature ejaculation, neurasthenia, premature aging, or even underdevelopment or infertility after marriage, taking "Bouti Kang" will achieve a rejuvenating effect. Among a thousand cases, there are almost no disappointments.

Premature aging and kidney deficiency not only weaken the love between husband and wife but also lead to the tragedy of lifelong infertility. Sexual power and health are directly proportional, so people with premature aging and kidney deficiency should actively take the sexual gland essence preparation for men, "Bouti Kang," which will not only exert healthy sexual power but also gradually improve their physical health.

Modern Medicine

### The Newest and Most Advanced Gonorrhea Treatment

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

The survival of the fittest is an inevitable phenomenon in life, especially when it comes to internal medicines for treating gonorrhea, which are very complex. New medicines emerge like bamboo shoots after a rain. However, most of them are short-lived, which is because many internal medicines for gonorrhea cannot withstand practical tests. Therefore, they can only decline miserably.

Among gonorrhea patients, countless have become disabled due to gonorrhea, mostly due to delayed or incorrect treatment, the use of inferior medicines, and poor surgical procedures. The use of inferior medicines is especially harmful.

The bacteria that cause gonorrhea are constantly changing. Inferior medicines can only kill a small portion of the bacteria or have a slight effect on the superficial mucous membrane. Such effects cannot completely resolve the gonorrhea.

Any plan to completely eradicate gonorrhea must enable the patient to develop anti-gonorrheal and bactericidal effects in a short period of time after taking the internal medicine, so that the medicine can bear the important responsibility of eliminating gonorrhea.

"Kelinnong" has long been praised worldwide, and its outstanding efficacy has stood the test of time, so it can appear in the newest form among the many gonorrhea medicines. "Kelinnong" is based on non-specific therapy and is made from a mixture of proteome and yellow pigment. It is effective against gonorrhea that cannot be treated by general chemical therapy and membrane-permeable bactericidal therapy, such as prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, cystitis, female gonorrhea leukorrhea, and vaginal ulcers. Taking "Kelinnong" can completely solve these problems in three to five weeks. Therefore, gonorrhea experts from various countries have written articles praising it.

### Tuberculosis Can Be Cured Quickly and Completely

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

The words "tuberculosis" not only frighten patients but also make healthy people talk about it with fear. The disease of tuberculosis comes on slowly, but the results are invariably adverse. Therefore, tuberculosis accounts for more than 80 percent of the mortality rate in our country, which is alarming. However, based on my more than 20 years of experience, tuberculosis can not only be treated but also cured quickly and completely, as long as patients can receive the correct treatment and trust the transcendent medicinal power of "Bufei Naer." Even critical symptoms of the second and third stages can be turned around.

"Bufei Naer" is a medicine made scientifically from various mineral and plant ingredients that kill tuberculosis bacteria. After taking this medicine, it can invigorate breathing, relieve coughs and phlegm, and stop hemoptysis. Because the treatment method is simple, it is praised by tuberculosis experts from various countries.

### Concerns of Seminal Emission Patients About Marriage

— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

When a strong young man has an abundance of semen, it is normal for it to overflow every half month or month. However, if it is frequently discharged every two or three days or even every day, this is pathological seminal emission, and patients need to be treated. Because the excessive discharge of semen consumes too much of a person's resources, causing mental fatigue and fatigue of the nerve center, the erectile power becomes paralyzed, leading to impotence. Therefore, both theoretically and practically, seminal emission, impotence, and premature ejaculation are inseparable. For this reason, seminal emission patients should actively seek treatment before marriage to avoid becoming a husband who cannot satisfy his wife in the future.

A patient named Ying Liyu, 23 years old, from Haimen, Zhejiang, (stated) that during the onset of puberty, he was induced by a young neighbor into masturbation, which became a habit. About a year and a half later, seminal emission was discovered, initially nocturnal emission, about three or four times a month. Later, it became nocturnal emission without dreams, doubling the number of times. He realized the harm of masturbation, but his development had already been hindered. Last autumn, he married under the orders of his parents. He experienced premature ejaculation during sexual intercourse, with the longest time being no more than 100 seconds. There was no affection between the couple, so he sought treatment. (Treatment process) I ordered him to take care of himself, take "Naier Seminal Emission Tablets" to consolidate his seminal vesicle, and also take "Bouti Kang" to replenish the deficiencies and treat premature ejaculation. After two and a half months of treatment, all of the above symptoms disappeared.

### Leukorrhea That Has Turned into Orchitis

— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: Intersection of Sichuan Road, 9 Ningbo Road

Most people think that gonorrhea is just a disease of the urethra, so they often neglect to treat it. They do not know that gonorrhea is a sinister and untamed inferior bacterium that can destroy the health of various tissues and cause them to become diseased. In particular, if gonorrhea bacteria enter the testicles, orchitis will occur, often leading to the danger of losing the ability to reproduce. However, if treatment can be carried out quickly, it may be possible to save the situation. Now I will show an example to illustrate the rest.

Mr. Cao Hanyun, who lives on Alabaster Road, is 40 years old, a businessman. (Source of disease) Discord between husband and wife led to visits to prostitutes. After contracting gonorrhea, he was delayed by incorrect treatment with general chemical therapies and membrane treatment on the market, resulting in a chronic condition (current symptoms). Leukorrhea appears intermittently. After exertion, there is more gonorrhea in the urine, and there is often pus flowing from the urethral opening in the morning. This leads to difficulty in urination. The testicles have gradually become swollen and hard as stone for five years, making walking difficult. Pain also occurs in the middle of the night, and there has been no fertility for many years. Introduced by someone, he came here for treatment (diagnosis): The diagnosis results confirmed that it was orchitis and had a tendency to harden. Ordinary preparations are not effective. He was ordered to take "Kelinnong," a proteome yellow pigment mixture preparation, and also received German static electricity treatment. In about two weeks, the leukorrhea stopped and the urine cleared. Because he was eager to return home, he purchased "Kelinnong" himself. He then sent a letter saying that after taking "Kelinnong," the illness was improving day by day. Although the illness did not worsen during the journey due to the fatigue of travel. Now my illness has been completely cured, and my wife's gonorrhea leukorrhea has also been cured by taking "Kelinnong" and using "Kamian Xuedi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, etc. Clinic hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen each day, and each patient will only be charged 5 jiao.

### Frequent Fires in Hongkou, All Starting in Factories or Warehouses; Investigation Suggests Arson

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that Warehouse No. 25 of the Gonghexing Wharf on East Broadway Road caught fire and burned at around 5:00 PM last night (the 9th). The Hongkou Fire Brigade and the Central Fire Brigade rushed to put out the fire, which was extinguished shortly after. The roof of the warehouse was severely damaged. The warehouse contained bleaching powder, matches, and 500 bales of cotton recently shipped from Japan on the Japanese ship "Taiyo Maru," all of which were burned or water-damaged. Traces of arson were then discovered. There were many pieces of unburned elemental phosphorus around the cotton bales, which were said to be similar to the phosphorus released by the incendiary bombs during the war the year before last. According to another source, fires have been frequently reported in all factories, wharfs, and warehouse areas in eastern Shanghai, Hongkou, and Yangshupu in recent days, and some have been described as strange fires. According to people from Hongkou, more than eight or nine factories in Yangshupu caught fire one after another after 8:00 PM the night before last. After investigation, the factories that caught fire and their situations were as follows: (1) Shenxin No. 6 Factory at the intersection of Lan Road and Hejian Road: A fire started in the cleaning room at 7:00 PM on the 9th. Three cleaning machines were burned, causing losses of more than 100,000 yuan. When the Japanese army received the report, they sent more than 400 soldiers to surround the factory. First, the female workers were released, but the male workers were not allowed to leave. After searching, 40 workers were arrested by 10:00 PM, and then the Japanese army withdrew. (2) Meihua Weaving Factory on Hekai Road: A fire started in the finished clothing warehouse, burning more than 300 bales of white and yellow cloth, each bale containing more than 200 bolts of cloth. It was extinguished after rescue. (3) Shanghai No. 4 Cotton Mill on Lan Road and Pingliang Road: A fire started in the cleaning room. Fortunately, the Japanese in the factory immediately noticed it and lowered more than 200 pieces of foreign cloth from the building, suppressing the fire, but the losses were still very large. (4) Kangtai Velvet Factory on Huade Road: A fire started in the cotton batting room, burning a large amount of cotton cloth. A person was injured when the fire engine came to put out the fire. (5) Hengfeng Cotton Mill on Huasheng Road: A fire started in the cleaning room of the old factory, burning two cleaning machines and a lot of cotton. In addition, Shenxin No. 5 Factory, Weitong Weaving Factory, and other factories also caught fire at the same time, but fortunately, they were all put out effectively, and no major disasters occurred. It was also reported that when the fires started the night before last, the entire Japanese Marine Corps was mobilized, announcing a special curfew. Traffic east of Huasheng Road was temporarily cut off, and the situation was extremely tense. After 12:00 AM, it calmed down slightly. It seemed that there were no alarms in ordinary residential houses.

### Silk Shop Manager Accused of Embezzlement, Forcing Bookkeeper to Falsify Accounts; Bookkeeper Testifies Truthfully in Court; Ordered to Investigate Accounts Outside and Verify Again

Wang Zhonglin from Nanhui, formerly partnered with his brother-in-law Qiu Dasheng, opened the Da Zhang Silk Shop on Nanhui North Gate Street, with Wang as the manager. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, when the county seat of Nanhui fell, Wang and Qiu moved the shop's goods to Shanghai, pretending to operate at No. 55, Hele Lane, Xiamusi Road, Ladu Road intersection, French Concession. After Qiu Dasheng passed away in January of this year, Wang, considering his sister-in-law Qiu Wangshi a woman from the countryside,

Illiterate

thinking she was easy to deceive, actually did not record in the accounts over two hundred yuan for mourning clothes materials used for his mother's funeral, and one thousand five hundred yuan for goods sold to Tian Tai Xiang. This was discovered by Qiu Wangshi, who requested an audit but was refused. Qiu Wangshi then retained lawyer Xi Mengqi to represent her, suing Wang Zhonglin in the Second Special Court for embezzlement of jointly owned business property, requesting legal investigation and bringing a civil suit, ordering the delivery of all account books for liquidation, etc. Upon receiving the complaint, the court, led by Judge Liao Yuan, held two hearings. The defendant Wang Zhonglin only

Submitted Account Books

fifteen in number, claiming that there were separate account books recording the materials used for his mother's funeral and the goods sold to Tian Tai Xiang. He was ordered to pay a shop bond of five hundred yuan and reschedule the submission of accounts for further questioning. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, another hearing was held, and the defendant submitted an account book containing records of the materials used for his mother's funeral and the goods sold to Tian Tai Xiang. Upon examination, the court found that the handwriting in the account book was inconsistent, and the entries in the latter part appeared to be copied at once.

When Questioned, Wang Claimed

that the first part was written by the bookkeeper Jiang Qifu, and the latter part was written by himself. Jiang Qifu was present in court and, after being summoned for questioning, testified that Wang had told him not to record the materials used for Wang's mother's funeral and the goods sold to Tian Tai Xiang. After the lawsuit arose, Wang came to him, asking him to add the above-mentioned two batches of goods to the account book. Because he refused, Wang repeatedly begged for help, promising a reward of fifty yuan afterward and writing a note for him. Because he

Could Not Be Partial

he did not agree to his request. Wang threatened outside that if he lost the case, he would beat him to death. He now presented Wang's note to the court for inspection. Currently, the account books submitted by Wang are still missing two books for cash and total merchandise, etc. When Wang was confronted about this, he continued to evade responsibility, claiming embezzlement and that the note was written by Jiang at his request. Finally, the court ordered both parties to investigate the accounts outside, check the inventory, and reschedule the hearing. The court also ruled that the guarantor, Tian Tai Xiang, had no business license, and was ordered to provide an additional written guarantee of one thousand yuan, otherwise, he would be detained.

However, in terms of the situation, it was slightly weak and stable.

Spot yarn situation: The market opened in the early morning, continuing the momentum from the previous day and moving forward, with the opening price increasing by 3.5 yuan to 412 yuan, and the spot price at 419 yuan. Shortly afterward, market sentiment suddenly became tense, with rumors that merchants from Guangdong and Shantou had placed orders, causing market tremors and a surge in buying, with prices increasing step by step. In an instant, foreign warehouse goods reached 427 yuan, and warehouse receipts reached 418.5 yuan. However, some bulls had already sold out, leaving them in a short position. Only one person had a large outstanding position, which is why the market for spot yarn has seen such large inflows and outflows recently.

### World Cotton Markets All Rise, Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading Stalls, Changshu and Taicang Cotton Only for Local Use

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market rose in the early morning due to good news from Liverpool and a daily shortage of inventory in the spot market. Yesterday, it rose another 15 points, causing forward prices to also improve by more than 10 points. According to the current situation, it is very likely that the July price will rise to 9 points outside customs. Washington has not yet made a clear statement on the release and subsidies of loan cotton, so most in the industry remain on the sidelines. Yesterday, India, including forecasts, also improved by one rupee, and Egypt rose slightly by several points. Converted into legal tender, American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 1 yuan 60 cents per dan, Indian cotton rose by 50 cents, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 40 cents.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading has stalled for several days due to the soaring overseas cotton markets, making it impossible for all parties to purchase. The Baikulu cotton previously purchased by various traders was averaging a profit of 5 to 6 yuan per dan. However, in recent days, there have been buyers but no sellers, and various traders have been unable to sell. However, the factories' intention to purchase raw cotton is still strong. If the overseas cotton market rebounds slightly, the factories plan to purchase in large quantities. The factory prices converted from yesterday's cotton market are listed below:

However, according to some, there are still 20% to 30% of the stocks of Changshu and Taicang cotton, but since the transportation and shipping are difficult and the taxes are heavy, they cannot be transported out. They are probably sold to local Litai yarn factories for use. 486 bales of Subei cotton arrived in Tongzhou. The situation of spot cotton is recorded below:

### Grains: Tianjin Receives Western Flour, Shanghai Flour Sales to the North Are Weak, Wheat Still Has No Formal Transactions

The flour market continued to be stable, and sales to customers were still sporadic. Because Tianjin has recently received Western flour, although Shanghai flour is still suitable, the current flour inventory of various factories is not abundant, making delivery very difficult. Therefore, customers in North China feel rather indifferent, and Southern and inland merchants are also only adding sporadically. Transactions were less than 30,000 bags. Number 2 flour still stood at 4 yuan 55 cents (cash) for the original price. According to the customer's intention, they want to suppress the small and take it, but the factory still lacks the intention to compromise, so both sides are still waiting for each other.

Wheat market transactions were still quiet. Most of the goods currently arriving are directly sent to factories and distributors. With the arrival of Western wheat, buyers are all trying to reduce prices. Even Japanese flour mills pay close attention to the mud content and apply strict discounts, so the holders of goods feel thorny. Yesterday, it was heard that goods sent to the factory were still at 6 yuan 56 cents, but there were no formal transactions in the market.

### Wuhu Xian Rice Falls Below 14 Yuan Limit Price, For Fear of Prolonged Storage Leading to Spoilage, Merchants Sell Stored Goods

Therefore, the high-quality passenger Xian rice continues to slightly decrease, Jingxian insists, but Wuhu Xian rice has fallen below the 14 yuan limit price. High-quality goods opened at 13 yuan 95 cents, and medium-quality goods decreased differently. Only broken rice is smoothly received by the local shops in this street and instead looks popular, with the price opening at 13 yuan to 12 yuan 70 cents. More than 5,000 bags were traded in total, because the shops think that the low price is suitable for blending, so there are many inquiries. Western rice also turned stable. It is still difficult to sell the new stock. Today, 940 bags of rice came from Hong Kong.

### Du Geng Rice Transactions Were Few

Yesterday, the sources of Du rice from various merchants, the He Xia arrived in the third Songjiang. Cars and buns, Su Tong merchants came to 1,500 or 600 bags, and the market situation has not changed. The reason is that Du Geng is short of goods on the market, the transaction is too little, Nangeng and Boa only have stacked goods, and there is little return, but the price is still 15 yuan, Du Yangjian wharf is extremely lacking in market goods, and it is even more invisible to the market at this time. Only the guest is still in mutual delivery, then sub-rice and broken rice are degraded by a corner, changing 兀still opened high goods twenty-one 兀, corner Lizun opened seventeen yuan,

The wholesalers are well-stocked with light-colored cloths for the season, and there are very few new additions. Only the upper-grade standard cloth, bleached cloth, and Western yarn are in high demand, with 2-3,000 pieces traded. This is because Chinese factories lack this type of grey cloth, and recently East goods grey cloth is preferred.

### How to Obtain Health?

How to obtain health? This is indeed a big question. Some people, in order to obtain a strong body, spare no expense to purchase only a few kinds of nourishing medicines. In fact, as long as you can pay a little attention to your daily "clothing, food, housing, and transportation," it is not difficult to obtain your ideal health. Therefore, the author specifically points out a few items below for the reference of all readers.

1.  Sunlight and Fresh Air — Always open doors and windows to let as much sunlight and fresh air in as possible. Open the windows at night when sleeping to circulate the air in the room. Take frequent walks in the morning and do more deep breathing exercises.

2.  Bedding Should Be Clean — The bedding that protects the body must be very clean and not too thick or too heavy, because skin hygiene is also very important.

4.  Do Not Overeat — Even foods with a lot of nutrients should not be overeaten. The saying "eat 80% full, and you will never need a doctor" is a good example. Chew more when eating and do not eat too quickly.

Otherwise, if the posture is incorrect, it is easy to hinder the blood circulation of the intestines. As a result, neurasthenia, constipation, etc., will all arise.

### 晴雨布

Rain-or-shine cloth, in the past, there were people in Shanghai who invented it as well, but the results of the experiments were ultimately not as good as rubberized rainproof cloth. However, the rain-or-shine cloth sold in Guilin not only overcomes these shortcomings but also possesses advantages such as lightness and low price. Therefore, I feel it is necessary to introduce it.

The inventors of the rain-or-shine cloth are Mr. Huang Jingyi from Meixian, Guangdong, and Mr. Zhang Qijian from Wujin, Jiangsu. They went to Guilin last winter and, recognizing the need for raincoats and the fact that they were not only expensive on the market (raincoats sold for three or four yuan in Shanghai were selling for as much as seventeen yuan in Guilin) but also often out of stock, the two decided to research this type of rainproof rain-or-shine cloth. After five months of research and continuous experimentation, they finally completed the manufacture of the rain-or-shine cloth at the end of last month. The cloth used for the rain-or-shine cloth is locally produced homespun cloth from various regions. In other words, any type of cloth, regardless of its quality, can be transformed into a raincoat after undergoing their modification process. At the same time, after their modification process, the original cloth quality is not changed, nor is it made heavier, so it remains as light and convenient as before. This type of clothing and cloth can be worn not only on sunny days but also as a raincoat on rainy days. Its price in Guilin is only five yuan in national currency, which is two-thirds cheaper than imported goods; and its effectiveness is better and more durable than those sold for three or four yuan apiece in Shanghai, or seventeen yuan apiece in Guilin. Recently, feeling the urgency of the need on the market, they have established the Xinghua Industrial Society in Guilin with Mr. Yang Zhenzhong and others, specializing in the sale of this rain-or-shine cloth and the modification of ordinary clothing into raincoats. According to the letter, after mass production, the cost should be reduced, and the selling price should also be lowered.

This time, they sent me a sample of the cloth, a piece of cloth that has only been through their two refining processes. After more than ten experiments, I found it very satisfactory. Not only does cold water not penetrate the cloth surface, but neither does boiling water. According to their letter, ordinary cloths for sale and clothes sent to them for modification must be refined six to ten times. Now I have experimented with their cloth that has only been refined twice, and it already has such satisfactory results; I firmly believe that cloth refined six times or more will have a better effect than rubber raincoats. After this cloth is invented, it will not only be very useful for military purposes but also of great help to the working class and students. Ordinarily, one must at least prepare a raincoat or an umbrella on rainy days, and when it rains heavily, one has to rely on vehicles. Now, however, one only needs to wear this one piece of clothing and prepare a hat, and no matter how heavy the rain is, it can be used. Not only is it convenient to use, but it can also save a lot of money. Therefore, I believe that this rain-or-shine cloth can also be manufactured and sold in Shanghai, so that ordinary people can buy and wear it. This will not only give the national goods industry a boost and save the country a lot of money, but it will also directly benefit the petty bourgeoisie a lot. Therefore, I have already contributed the above opinions to Mr. Huang and Mr. Zhang, hoping that they will come to Shanghai to set up a factory to manufacture it. Soon, I should be able to get their reply.

### Home-Made Soybean Milk

— He Lisan

Soybean milk is a popular food rich in vitamin nutrition for the common people. In the early morning, using it to complement breakfast is truly cheap and delicious. With sesame cake and fried dough sticks, or glutinous rice rolls, plus a bowl of soybean milk. If you like it salty, add some seaweed, dried shrimp, shrimp roe and soy sauce, and you can eat it with relish. If you break an egg and mix it with hot soybean milk, adding some white sugar, the taste is both rich and delicious, and its nutritional power is even greater. However, the soybean milk sold on the market, such as that made by tofu shops or soybean milk stalls, is not clean enough. Sometimes its color is yellowish, and its taste is bitter. After eating it, there are always some black sediments. So, to be particular about eating soybean milk, it is best to make it yourself. I used to make it at home. The method is to soak one hundred and several dozen soybeans in clear water overnight. Early in the morning, use a small stone mill to grind them into soybean milk. Then add an appropriate amount of clear water and filter the juice through a clean white cloth bag. If there is no stone mill, mash it with a small stone mortar, add water to mix it, and filter the juice. Simmer it and serve it, and it can be used as a drink for one or two people. Its color is clean white, and its texture is fresh, beautiful and mellow. Compared to what is sold in the market and on the streets, there is a world of difference. However, in the homes of residents in Shanghai, very few have such stone mills and stone mortars prepared. Even if you want to buy new ones, they are not suitable for use because of stone chips, which is a pity. If there is a hand-cranked small mechanical device that can grind the slurry, that would be even more convenient and appropriate.

### The Necessity of Parks

— Zhuo Dai

The nine-year-old child next door to me asked me how to explain the word "family"? I couldn't answer for a moment.

Because Chinese families don't have courtyards. A courtyard is a patio. To put it more elaborately, it is a garden.

Except for the families with high halls and large buildings that have an attached garden, other families, even if they have a patio, it is just a completely unadorned thing. For smaller families, there is only a crab-eye patio left.

The worst is Shanghai. In normal times, a building houses eight or nine families, and there is only a chimney-like patio. Since the outbreak of the war, of course, it is even worse. It is not easy to find a room, and even if you find one, there is no place to dry clothes, let alone a courtyard.

But since it is called a family, it cannot be without a courtyard. First of all, the sanitary conditions are not met; but then again, not every family can build a garden, so does that mean that families without gardens cannot be called families and do not need to pay attention to hygiene?

Because there is this need, there should be park facilities in the city to make up for the lack of courtyards. A park is a public garden for all families in the city. With parks in the city, families in the city can be called families. Although their courtyard is not together with their home, there is always the reality of a courtyard.

The number and area of parks in the city should originally be proportional to the density of the city's population, and the location of the parks should be distributed evenly, so that some people are not too far away from the park.

Therefore, there is no need for parks in rural areas. The small houses in the countryside are dotted in the natural fields. These fields are a natural garden. For this type of family, there is not only no lack of courtyards, but there are many, which is exactly the opposite of the city.

I hope that people in the city will not forget that parks are a part of the family, and they should often be close to them and pay attention to them.

### Ford's Action

— Binbin

Ford, everyone knows that he is the world-famous car king. He is already seventy-six years old this year and has manufactured twenty-six million cars, but it is very strange that his daily means of transportation is not a car but a bicycle. Since a serious illness three years ago, he likes riding a bicycle the most among many sports, thinking that it is the most suitable exercise for the elderly. Every day, he rides his bicycle from home to the car factory, a round trip of three miles. Someone advised him to switch to a car and get more rest. But he refused, saying, "Rest? There is only one way, go to rest on time every night, so that you can get up early the next day and continue to work." The spirit of this old gentleman is very admirable.

### Questions and Answers from Tianxu Wosheng (Housing Insurance Issues)

1.  No matter what catches fire, any brand of fire extinguisher can be used to put it out, but if you see a fire and don't try to put it out, but run away first, then no matter what catches fire, it will inevitably develop into a prairie fire, and there will be the regret of using a cup of water to put out a cartload of firewood. As for the quality of the fire extinguisher, it all depends on whether the extinguisher body is strong and the chemical foam is thick. For gasoline, liquor, and incendiary bomb fires, "special" chemical foam is required to have a chemical reaction. If you buy something that is similar but not quite, it is like buying dried radish to replace ginseng. This is what is appropriate, and you will know it without asking.

2.  The extinguisher body must be made of brand new "furnace steel plate" and welded, and the outside must be "automobile paint" to avoid the disadvantages of easy decay and cracking. However, when using old iron sheet and ordinary paint, the cost can be reduced by three-quarters. This is the same as using old materials to make clothes, which are easy to tear. The length of its life is like comparing the young and strong with the old and frail, which is permissible without asking. The method of identification is only to weigh its weight, so as to avoid being deceived.

3.  The thickness of the chemical foam can be tested by using two glass cups of the same size, filling them with one-third water, and adding the same weight of chemical powder to each, and see what the shape of the foam is like. Fine powder, such as "ice cream," is a strong and true chemical foam. If it is a hollow large bubble, like crab foam, then it is a substitute for alum and baking soda, with soap powder added to make it similar. Although it can also put out the fire, its effectiveness is less than two-tenths. Therefore, in the ratio of one part to five parts, it is better to win with less than to have more, so that it can be extinguished easily and not develop into an unstoppable situation. (The method of selection when purchasing any brand of fire extinguisher is only as described above. This brand of fire extinguisher is currently out of stock, but orders can be placed. No matter how many or few, a deposit of five yuan per unit is required, and delivery will be made on time, calculated at 90% of the original price of forty yuan per unit, and a free chemical refill will be included. If you wish to participate in share distribution, there are separate guidelines, and a letter of request will be sent immediately. Compared to creating your own product, it is much more stable.)

### One-Week Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

The day before yesterday, the editor forwarded a letter from Ms. Shao Guoying of Daode Lane, Beile Road, praising my economical menu, saying that it saves her the trouble of racking her brains every night for the next day's side dishes, and expressing her gratitude to me. I don't think my menu is much of a contribution, but I am very grateful to Ms. Shao for adopting it. Ms. Shao also said that she has recently seen many tomatoes on the market, and the price is still cheap. Although she knows that they are rich in vitamins, she is distressed that she does not know how to use them in dishes, and asks me to give some instructions. So I boldly added tomatoes to this week's menu, and I still need Ms. Shao's guidance. Tomatoes are often used as raw vegetables in Western cuisine, but they originally had no place in Chinese dishes. However, in recent years, my family has used them in home-style dishes, and the taste is not bad. One: Cut the tomatoes into chunks and braise them with tender beef and cabbage, which is a very good soup. Two: Cut the tomatoes into two halves, like a box, chop the pork into patties, embed them in the middle, and braise them with bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, and wood ear fungus, which also has a special flavor. Three: Cut the tomatoes into thin slices, mix them with sesame sauce and eat them, which is refreshing. Ms. Shao might as well try the above three methods.

Old News Re-Copied (25)

### Contention for a Groom

(From this newspaper in May of the 11th year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty)

The owner of Yi Tai Foreign Firm accused groom Xu Sheng. It was claimed: "He has been grooming horses at my place for nine years. During the bandit rebellion, I rescued him from the Long Hair rebels. Now, he requested leave to go to Jiangsu. Presuming that he is familiar with horse-raising, he disregarded the care and favor he received over the years. After returning to Shanghai, he did not inform me of his resignation and went to work for Yuan Yuan Foreign Firm grooming horses. I implore the consul to forward the case to the public court, to bring Xu Sheng to me." According to his statement: "Although I have been at the old master's place for many years, I was not rescued from the Hair Rebels, there was no meritorious service. The value of the favor received was merely fodder and beans. Moreover, the old master often beat and scolded me, even to the point of severe beatings and fainting. Now, the new master has stated that he will never beat or scold me. I am determined not to go to Yi Tai again." The owner of the new Yuan Yuan Firm also submitted a case on his behalf. Magistrate Zhang held a joint trial and sentenced him to ten days in jail as a warning. After the full term, he is free to choose. Upon investigation, the contention for the groom is because the Westerners will choose a day to hold horse races within the next few days, and whoever grooms the horses will be familiar with everything and will be greatly valued, hence this contention. The translator appointed by the consul, who knows the reason, deliberated and ordered him to be jailed for ten days, which is during the horse racing period, intending to let both parties labor in vain over the contention.

### Extracting Money from Toileting

There is a new pit latrine in Hongkou, which is extremely tall and clean, with a board in the middle, like a building. There are dozens of holes, divided into two rows, which are the holes for toileting. Underneath, there is no pit, but buckets are used to receive the waste, and the upper and lower parts are far apart, so as not to let the foul air steam up. Each person on the upper level has a barrier at the toileting place, and there is a door to close. If someone enters the latrine, they are charged five coppers and given a piece of toilet paper and two cigarettes. If they bring their own cigarettes, they only need three coppers. Every day, there is an endless stream of people, and the manager is almost too busy to keep up. A new pit latrine is fragrant for three days, but this is not fragrant for three days.

### Regarding Literary and Art Workers

— Zhou Xueming

The storm of the "August 13th" national revolution has impacted and shaken everything in the country. The old has been discarded, and the new is growing in blood. As a reflection of the spirit of the times, literature and art inevitably have their own special progress.

First of all, it should be pointed out that the unprecedented national crisis has promoted the unity of writers, which has its historical roots. China's new literature and art have always been inseparable from the national liberation movement. Especially in the current stage, in order to complete the tasks of the war of resistance and democracy in literature, regardless of their colors and factions (except for traitors and Trotskyites, of course), they should embark on a very frank and sincere path of mutual respect, exploration, and cooperation!

Secondly, due to the development of the war of resistance, the lifestyles of writers have undergone tremendous changes. Most of them have gone to the front line or to the guerrilla areas to fulfill their tasks, found truth in the battle life, and their life patterns are more extensive.

This great war of resistance is a mass undertaking, and everything must be based on them as the main force. In this way, literature and art must take on the mission of mobilizing them. Therefore, using old forms to establish mass literature and art has become the most urgent task for writers.

In order to adapt to objective needs, small-scale works such as sketches, communications, and reports have replaced cumbersome and lengthy works. This new function is to grasp the fragments of the drastically changing reality and express them powerfully. The literary communication movement that has recently unfolded is further emphasizing this feature.

These facts all prove the progress of the literary and art circles since the war of resistance. However, due to the insufficient subjective strength of some writers, the weaknesses exposed are also not uncommon.

The most worthy of mentioning is the issue of the utilization of old forms by some writers. As a result of being too accommodating and abusive to it, they have not yet fully obtained its clear, concise, and popular means of expression. In fact, there is a very unharmonious phenomenon between the old forms and the new content, and even feudal superstitious vocabulary and expressions are still being adopted.

As for the one-sidedness of the themes, it has further led the literature and art of the war of resistance into the path of formulas. Most of the articles only write about the bravery of the soldiers at the front and ignore the characters of all levels in the rear. The changing thoughts and ways of life, or other forms, along with the war of resistance, can all be used as descriptive themes.

In addition, some writers often have the problem of self-incarnation in the character representations of their works. For example, the masses who are illiterate can actually say many technical terms that are not appropriate. The masses are naturally alienated from these. As a result, paper has become the so-called "donkey literature" that is neither a donkey nor a horse!

Now that the war of resistance has developed to the second stage, our literary and art workers should give full play to their abilities, review the past, cooperate with the objective situation, and fulfill the responsibility of their pens. Here, what we should pay attention to is:

(1) Be cautious in the use of forms, especially for the adoption of local folk songs, to infuse new content.

(2) The themes should be deepened and expanded to all levels, avoiding "formulas".

(3) Make full use of mass vocabulary to overcome the shortcomings of being isolated from the masses.

(4) The artistic authenticity must be unified with the popularization of the content.

The literature and art of the war of resistance are progressing with the times, and there is a new enlightenment significance in it. Let us grasp this quickly.

### Spring City Has Flowers Flying Everywhere

— Lu Min

### Shi Dakai's Poems

— Zou Xiao

Shi Dakai's poems are very few in the Poetry and Prose Anthology of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the collection compiled by Lu Jiye, which makes readers feel insufficient. In addition, Xu Zhiyan's re-edited "Shi Dakai's Diary", according to the preface, Xu Zhiyan once "embellished the words", then, whether this diary is true or embellished by a few points, has become a question. Shi Dakai must have written a lot of poems, but we can now only see thirty poems. "Shi Dakai's Complete Works" has four more poems than "Poetry and Prose Anthology of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom", "To Mr. Shi Longxuan of Xiangxiang".

The two poems of feeling in Shi Dakai's diary are recorded in all books. In addition, there are many topics on writing poems, but unfortunately nineteen did not attach the original poems. For example, it is said:

"The first day of the fourth month. I wrote several poems, intending that the Northern Wei were specialized and powerful, like Yongshan. Within a month, they would bleed each other. The way of heaven is good, and why should people be evil!"

"April 24th. Watching the moon at Wansong Rock at night, I recited several poems, and the fourth girl echoed them." (This was in Jingzhou) "May 1st. My daughter, the fourth girl, married Ma Shuji Delian, and I wrote a small poem to record it, with the sentence "It is natural for lovers to become dependents, dare to say that the colorful phoenix went with the crow", which is a factual record."

"May 28th. I touched old sorrows, unable to bear the resentment, and composed several poems. The manuscript was thrown away at hand, and the fourth girl stored it in her box for me. I don't know who will take it to cover the urn in the future." Shi's "Disorderly Separation" and "Our Dynasty Injured by Internal Disaster" were all written at this time.

"September 15th. Arrived at Yanping, passed Zheng Chenggong's former residence, and wrote a poem on the wall and left."

"April 6th. Visited Taoyuan, and galloped back in the evening, reciting several poems."

"May 5th. The fourth girl gave birth to a daughter, and I now have a granddaughter. I wrote a poem to show Ma Sheng."

If the diary is not fabricated, then, as recorded above, at least a dozen poems have been lost.

However, even among the existing thirty poems, some are unreliable. According to Liu Yazi, some were forged by his deceased friend Gao Tianmei to promote the revolution.

Among the existing poems, whether in terms of content or form, those close to Cao Zhi are quite numerous. Shi Dakai was also alienated by Hong Xiuquan and escaped because he was jealous of Wei Changhui! As it is said: "Quietly thinking about the three sighs, the sleeves are full of tears." "Our dynasty is hurt by internal disaster, alas, the heart is sad... What more can be said, where to go?" "The black horse suddenly does not go, the white day is late in the Central Plains. How wolfish the flesh and blood, the white bones are covered with roads." "The great river is crossed by boats, how can I cross the flow? Alas, there are no boats, I look back to the northwest at the floating clouds." "We have been together for a long time, and the separation is long... Ambition is thousands of miles, and the prestige shakes all directions:" All the above are very similar to Chen Siwang. In the chaotic era, he suffered, and nothing was unlike, no wonder even the poems were like it.

Although I know that some of Shi Dakai's poems are fake: what he said in his diary about writing poems is unreliable, but I always delusionally hope that they are all real. Maybe I like Shi Dakai too much? (Fundraising for charity sale)

### Destruction and Rebirth

— Ding Di

Disappearing in the smoke and fire, desperate moans, painful tears, laughter turning into tears, bustling city turning into desolate ruins, familiar faces turning into recalled names, reunited families, turning into chirping new ghosts.

Buried in the devil's hands: human vows, clues of happiness, air of peace, wealth of life, mines of morality, wings of freedom.

Insert one thorn after another, piercing the dreams of your clothes. The past maturity and beauty are not fantasy and arrogance, dreams, one by one, round and full fruits, cracked, falling to the ground, withered, destroyed, buried in the soil.

Unable to endure the pain of the thorns, nor willing to be destroyed, the fruit is buried, because it is green with rain, sunshine and soil, it will eventually germinate again, bud, bloom, and bear fruit.

——Destroyed, it will be reborn.

As long as there is a breath of life, the potential of life, unwilling to be silent, unwilling to perish, everything can be reborn. The bud withers, it can re-germinate. The bud fails, it can re-emerge. The flower falls, it can re-bloom: the fruit breaks, it can re-bear. The destroying thorn, pierces the clothes, but only increases the anger in your heart. Anger is like kerosene, poured on the dying fire of life, and people become more vigorous. Squeeze closer, you can push further away; oppress a little more, you can resist more: provoke a little more, you can be braver: destroy a little more, you can be reborn more.

I should thank the heart thorn, for destroying all of you, making you cherish, pity, hate, and curse. Without these, you would not take revenge. Without the propulsion of anger, you would not be so powerful. Without forced destruction, you would not demolish it yourself.

You have been destroyed, you have been pushed away, and you have been pierced. Those who cherish lost things, you must create new things; those who pity the destroyed, you must give them comfort; those who resent the perpetrators, you must give them revenge; those who curse the wicked, you must give them punishment.

There is no need to lament in the ruins, salvaging the old prosperity from the rubble, painting the setting sun on the dilapidated walls, and you will be speechless when you see it. You may as well be generous, indifferent, and smile at your enemies while sharpening your blade. I should thank destruction, destroying a fruit, which can produce two or three, or even hundreds. In the future, you can see the magnificent buildings rebuilt on the scorched earth, and the metabolism of new life will be healthier and more powerful than their ancestors. Corruption is destroyed, and soundness can be produced; the old is destroyed, and freshness can be produced: the sediment is destroyed, and purity can be produced.

Destruction makes us angry, but it also makes us stronger. I am not afraid of destruction, only afraid of no rebirth. (Fundraising for charity sale)

### Talking Leftovers

### Dedicated to Our Supreme Leader

— Guo Guo

My respected leader, to maintain the integrity of our nation's begonia leaf-shaped map, to ensure the peaceful existence of 450 million simple people on this "Begonia Leaf" land, you have embarked on an arduous journey. The hearts of 450 million people burn like fire. They wholeheartedly support you. And you, for the sake of the beautiful rivers and mountains, for the sake of the vast masses, should be even more mindful of the winds and sands of the battlefield.

My admired leader, I have seen snippets of your diligent cultivation. Although it was just a "snippet," it reminded people  of your full, extraordinary spirit and your will as strong as copper and iron. Four years ago, I heard your instructions. Your fiery words, the roar like a lion's roar, still resonate in my mind.

It seemed to plant the seeds of fire in the hearts of millions of young people. Ever since the first drop of blood splattered on the shore, these young people have bravely embarked on their journey. Some generously smeared their hot blood on the thick wilderness grass, some controlled iron birds to part the sky's clouds, some stirred up fierce waves in the green waves. … And the goal of their efforts is what you have indicated. The seeds you have diligently sown are already sprouting, budding, and bearing fruit. …

I, a drop of water among thousands, am firmly  entangled, unable to take big steps towards that bright and beautiful battlefield. Every time I think of your passionate instructions, the roar like a lion's roar, I burst into tears of shame and regret.

Now, I have completely wiped away my tears. I am working hard on other things, and the goal of my efforts is exactly the same as what you have indicated. On my desk is your photograph (cut from the newspaper), your sharp eyes are fixed on me, this is the driving force to encourage me to work hard and move forward. I hold the pen tightly, dipping it in ink, and also dipping it in blood and tears, leaving some words on white paper, hoping to stir up a small ripple in the minds of my compatriots.

Recently, I read your instructions in the newspaper again. In the tempering of artillery fire, your will has become stronger. Hearing your lion-like roar, they will also tremble. Under your leadership, victory will be ours sooner or later, for the sake of the bright and beautiful rivers and mountains, for the sake of the vast masses, we must also pay more attention to the winds and sands of the battlefield.

The Artistic World

### A Fallen Kun Opera Actress, Zhao Xiaolan, Returns Crestfallen

— Qing He

Self-inflicted boredom, new dignitaries hiding and not daring to show their faces, puppet show becomes a one-man show.

Zhao Xiaolan, a famous Kun opera actress from Beiping, led the Xiaolan Troupe, a group of dozens of people, to Nanjing at the invitation of the puppet "Reformed Government" to perform puppet shows at the Central Grand Theater for a week. This column has already recorded this in detail (see this column on April 13). Now, more news about Zhao Ling has been obtained from the opera circles, and it is recorded to inform all sectors of society in Shanghai who are concerned about the art world:

The puppet show of the Xiaolan Troupe in Nanjing was initiated by the puppet government and was not of a commercial nature, so no tickets were sold. The puppet government invited Chinese and Japanese "dignitaries" to "appreciate" the performance. However, at that time, Nanjing was full of rumors and everyone was on edge. The general "new dignitaries" were hiding and did not dare to show their faces. The great "clear singing and wonderful dancing" had no audience. Zhao Xiaolan turned a puppet show into a one-man show. Isn't that pitiful!

When Zhao was in Beijing, not only did she sing arias at the puppet banquet to add to the fun, but she also responded to the invitation of the "Great People's Assembly" and gave a "speech" on the "Radio Station without Money." What she talked about was praising the stability and speed of the "first opening of the Jinpu Railway." She even said that in the past, riding this train was bumpy and dirty, which made people feel unpleasant, but now there is no such "drawback." For a young girl to make such a shameless statement is truly a disgrace to the entire Chinese opera world!

After the one-man show was performed in Beijing, she received a "special reward" of five thousand yuan, and then distributed the troupe members and sent them back to the north. She then took a car with her mother to Shanghai. The purpose of her coming to Shanghai was to wait for an opportunity to join a troupe or be hired by a stage. However, all the stages did not pay attention to her and ignored her. The Zhao family mother and daughter felt extremely bored and had to return crestfallen a few days ago!

According to people, after Zhao came to Shanghai, she was invited by someone to broadcast on a "Shanghai Wireless Radio Station" in Hongkou twice, but the "Radio Station's" reporter did not specify who the broadcaster was, only calling her a "famous Peking opera artist." However, this statement cannot be fully verified.

### The Top Ten Beautiful Female Stars Selected by a Beauty Expert

— Gu Buwen

Here is a list of the "Top Ten Beautiful Female Stars", selected from the many glamorous female stars in Hollywood. Who is in charge of the selection? It turns out to be Madame Helena Rubinstein, the world-renowned beauty authority, who selected them last week when she returned from Australia and passed through Hollywood.

Madame Rubinstein is one of the most beautiful women in modern times, and has been serving the same-sex community for twenty-five years with her enduring beauty secrets. This time, when she visited Paramount and other companies, she talked with major movie stars and interacted frequently. Based on her deep experience, she selected ten of the most beautiful female stars on the screen.

The Beauty of Gentleness

(1) Joan Bennett: For her gentle beauty, graceful figure, and full possession of the characteristics of a blonde beauty.

(2) Claudette Colbert: For her charming and lively nature, and graceful manners. Her beautiful appearance is a feast for the eyes, and she exudes a continental style.

(3) Norma Shearer: For being able to show how women can enhance the value of beauty and goodness.

(4) Loretta Young: For her delicate and lively nature, she is worthy of being a complete American beauty.

(5) Hedy Lamarr: For her soul-stirring charm, quiet manners, and beautiful posture.

According to the above, there is a deep meaning. In the list selected by Madame Rubinstein, only one person is a blonde, fair-skinned beauty, namely Joan Bennett, so she is the best. The other nine beauties are mostly naturally colored, with black hair and brown skin.

### After Listening to "Chai Tou Feng"

— Zhang Xiao Cang

Mr. Fan Songfeng used Zhang Eyun's "Chai Tou Feng" as the new play to be performed in Shanghai this time, and specially reserved a good seat to invite me to appreciate it. I felt very disrespectful to refuse, so I agreed to dine with him at Jinjiang Restaurant, and then listen to the opera. We smiled and agreed. After listening to "Chai Tou Feng", I wrote this manuscript to submit to your esteemed newspaper, hoping that experts in the country will correct it. I would be very fortunate.

The play "Chai Tou Feng" was written by Chen Moxiang for Yu Huisheng to perform. Huisheng's expressions were originally known for their delicacy and grace, and she specialized in the childish innocence of young children. "Chai Tou Feng" is a tragic play. Since Huisheng's performance in Tianjin and Beijing in her early years, there has been a reputation for the "newly written 'Chai Tou Feng' that disturbed the intestines of the scholars and women of Chang'an." When she was in Shanghai, "Chai Tou Feng" was also the most magical of Huisheng's new plays. At that time, Huisheng paired with Jin Zhongren, Furong Cao, and Ma Fulu. This time, Eyun was assisted by Ye ShengLan as Lu You, Furong Cao as Qiu Xiang, Ma Changlu as the evil nun, Liu Surong as Zong Shicheng, Miao Shengchun as Dugu Ce, and Guan Shengxi as Lu's mother. The cast was complete. Among them, Zhang Eyun's Tang Huixian, Miao Shengchun's Dugu Ce, and Furong Cao's Qiu Xiang were particularly well-performed.

The plot of "Chai Tou Feng" was taken by Huisheng from the love history of the Song poet Lu You in his youth, and was developed into this opera. It is not entirely based on old people's continued hearing and Qidong Yeyu's news. According to the records of the old people's continued hearing, after Tang Huixian was expelled, she remarried Zong Shicheng in the same county. Lu You met her in Shen Garden, and wrote a poem "Chai Tou Feng" to express his feelings, and quoted Lu You's poems in his later years, "The spring waves under the sad bridge are green, and I will see the startled swan's shadow coming." Huisheng's performance changed it to Huixian not marrying, and Zong Shicheng was used to collect the spilled water, and Huixian had many setbacks and finally died with regret. This kind of editing can increase the audience's emotion, and the plot tends to be sad and poignant. This must have been done by Moxiang on purpose, there is no doubt. Eyun's performance is known for its natural and unrestrained nature. In recent years, her singing and dialogue have been striving to learn from Yu Shuang, and the piano of Mu Tiefen and Li Jinlong and the drums of Wei Xiyun have been effectively set off, which makes her more energetic. In the "Chai Tou Feng", the southern tune, Erliu, Erhuang Slow Plate, and Sanban all have their own aphorisms. In the Erliu, the last sentence "Why bother to talk to others again" adds a cushion word to become "Why bother again...:". It is not surprising that Linggong occasionally adds cushion words in the lyrics, but listening to the full text of Chai Tou Feng Erliu from beginning to end on that day, I feel that the word added by Eyun, I think is very perfect, and Yang Baosen also added a cushion word in "Scolding Cao" that day, but in terms of the meaning of the text, it is not as good as Eyun. Eyun's last illness scene used Furong Cao to play Qiu Xiang, holding a lamp in one hand and supporting Eyun in the other, and the section of Sanban before her death was a technique from the sickroom in Hong Yang Dong, without falling into cliches, which is also the most clever part of Moxiang. Ma Fulu's recent performances seem to be freehand, but in fact they are lax and not worth taking. Ye ShengLan has nothing brilliant to show in this play. Liu Lianrong's hard work is only mediocre. Guan Shengxi also has no significant records. Although Furong Cao has no role to play, she is lightly sketched. Before Huixian's death, her facial expressions were like writing the Yellow Court Sutra for the first time. This person can really act, and can use a little to win a lot. Miao Tengchun's chivalrous Dugu Ce, the dialogue is clean and sharp, every word is a pearl, and his gestures are also like those of his predecessors. Among all the supporting roles in Chai Tou Feng, Miao Shengchun is the most satisfying. If he were not ill, his performance would be even more outstanding and amazing.

After listening to Yun's song "Chai Tou Feng", Mr. Songfeng thought that Chen Moxiang was famous for writing plays, why didn't he compose a good song for this lyrics, so that this song would be more energetic. Mr. Fan's words are indeed the words of a famous musician, and I will record them to inform the readers.

### About a Generation's Femme Fatale

— (Lu)

Li Li from Beiping, this "generation's femme fatale", after being involved in espionage suspicions, was invited by smart film merchants to star in this "Generation's Femme Fatale". Li Li once co-starred with Gao Zhanfei in "Spring Tide". This is her second work, and whether she will continue to make movies with us in the future is a difficult question to guess.

The story of "Generation's Femme Fatale" probably tells the story of a sophisticated socialite who is surrounded by princes and nobles, and finally falls in love with a painter. Li Li is naturally playing the socialite, and Zhang Yi, known as the "Lion", is playing the painter Li Zhongfei. Many other actors were also actors who were in Shanghai before. Now I will write the actor list I found below:

Zhang Lili (Li Li) Li Zhongfei (Zhang Yi) Zhu Ziliang (Jiang Junchao) Zhu Ziqing (You Guanren) Wang Ruizhen (Xu Mandian) Ma Lechang (Lu Dun) Ma Jian (Yao Ping) Wang Shao Cai (Feng Feng) Oumeiying (Wei Pengfei) Hu Xiaodong's wife (Tang Xueqian) Zhou De's wife (Wang Feifei) Hu Xiaodong (Zhi Cheng) Lin (Yang) Feng Ruolan (Bai) Alian (Huang Meizhi)

This film was made in both Cantonese and Mandarin versions. The Mandarin version has been shipped to Shanghai, and it will probably be screened at the Jincheng Grand Theater this month.

### After Watching the Drama of the Sino-French Alumni Association

— Chen Wenxu

The Sino-French Alumni Association Drama Troupe officially performed "The Will of Life" and "Zhang Guan Li Dai" at the Golden Tat Theater for the first time. "The Will of Life" was originally a one-act play that was not easy to please, because the actors performed seriously, it actually won a lot of applause. Among them, the old father played by Shouzhong was the most outstanding, which was really rare. Mao Fan's Zi was also not weak. Miss Bai Lu, who played the daughter in the body of a daughter, was indeed a veteran. "Zhang Guan Li Dai" is a lighthearted satire, and also a one-act play, directed by Jiang Hong. Wang Guxiang, who played the male tenant, performed seriously and his attitude was natural, which added a lot of color to the whole play. Bai Lu's landlady, the best part is that she is completely different from the previous play. The old woman was played by Shi Yao, her movements were relaxed, but her pronunciation was a little low. This play was very tense from beginning to end. Especially when the male and female tenants combined with each other, under the "Zhang Guan Li Dai", they were delivered to the landlady who was bound by ethics, it was the most exciting, the performance was relaxed, and the dialogue was more humorous. The female tenant (played by Fei Lei) was able to firmly grasp the identity of the characters in the play and not let go. As for the policeman played by Zhu Yongming, he was also quite competent, and the makeup was even better. In short, it is rare for amateur actors to have such achievements in their first public performance.

### Tidbits from the Artistic World

"Seven Swords and Three Heroes" at the Tianchan Stage will be performed tomorrow night. After the play ended the night before, a costume rehearsal was held, and the results were very satisfactory.

The artists from the Yi Feng Troupe and the Grand Stage Troupe have successively comforted the isolated army, and Lu Wenyi will also launch a charity performance.

The performances of all classes in the New New Company will be suspended from the 15th. Zhang Yuanting, the manager of the Da Jing Troupe, said that if there is no room for activities in Shanghai, he will go to Hong Kong.

The Brutal Behavior of Warlords Killing Actors

As for that Ms. Wang Xiangting, according to general speculation, she must also be taken into the Governor's Mansion by Old Chu to become the Governor's wife. But this was not the case at all. Not only was she not driven by vanity to follow Chu's request to be his second concubine (Chu still had his original wife), but she also recommended a middle school graduate, Ms. Chen, to be Chu Yupu's fourth concubine. Although this Fourth Madam Chu was not very good-looking, her knowledge and methods were still acceptable. Old Chu was originally illiterate. Since he became the Governor in a muddle, of course all important documents had to be entrusted to someone. Since he got this help, many things were handled in consultation with her. Therefore, the Fourth Madam was very favored. Starting from the four words "relying on favor to be arrogant", a tragedy of killing actors was later staged.

Ms. Chen was also from Xuzhou, and she and Wang Xiangting were from the same hometown. Because her family was very poor, she relied entirely on her old mother to make needlework to make a living, so she entered the Peixin Girls' Middle School set up by the church, so that she could pay less tuition as a church member. The place where she and her mother lived was next to Wang Xiangting, so they often had contact with each other. Although Ms. Wang did not know a single character, she knew how to liberate herself from the mountain. She was born unwilling to be bound by others. She knew that Chu was cruel and fond of killing, unlike Zhang Changtui, who was broad-minded (Zhang had thirty or forty concubines, many of whom had affairs with the adjutants, but Zhang knew it and condoned it). If she had the status of husband and wife with Chu, she would be in danger of her life if she was not careful. Later, she witnessed Old Chu personally drag out the Third Madam from under the bed and shoot her to death with a pistol (also because of adultery), and felt especially frightened. Moreover, she herself already had a lover, Mr. Liu, with whom she had a very deep affection. Old Chu had also heard about this. If she followed Old Chu, she would have to immediately break off relations with Mr. Liu. If they still get along as friends as before, and do not live with Chu, even if some rumors reach Chu's ears, it will not matter. (8)
