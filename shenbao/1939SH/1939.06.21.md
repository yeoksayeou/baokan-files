### America Issues Strong Ultimatum to Japan, Urges Japan to be Mindful of Not Bombing American Property in China, Protests Blockade of Gulangyu and Prevention of Supplies, Hull States US Concern Over Developments in Tianjin

(Tokyo) The American Chargé d'Affaires delivered a formal note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon, urging the Japanese government to be mindful of the bombing of American businesses in China. The note sternly stated that the Japanese government had previously assured the American government that it would cease bombing American businesses. However, since the assurance was given, several bombing incidents have occurred. The note listed the names of the destroyed properties and then stated that, in view of the non-fulfillment of previous promises, it demanded an immediate guarantee of the Japanese government's future intentions. The American Chargé d'Affaires also delivered another note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, protesting the prevention of supplies to Gulangyu. The note stated that it seemed unbelievable that Japan would adopt such a strategy. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)

(Washington) United States Secretary of State Hull today formally stated that the United States is quite concerned about the larger implications of the developments in Tianjin. The US government is paying particular attention to all events related to developments in China. Hull declared that the American Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Dooman, had suggested, prior to the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, that the American Consul in Tianjin mediate the dispute between Britain and Japan over the extradition of four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng. The US government did not initially pay attention to the unexpected event itself, but it is quite concerned about the nature of subsequent developments and the larger implications of their significance, as well as all past and present actions and declarations by Japan in other parts of China. Therefore, the government is now paying particular attention to the daily developments in China. Hull also explained that the American proposal for mediation only concerned the dispute over the extradition of the four suspects, and the suggestion was made before the blockade. Washington currently has no plans to evacuate American women and children from Tianjin. (Reuter's dispatch, 19th)

(Washington) Well-informed sources view Hull's public announcement as a broad warning to Japan, stating that the United States is prepared to resist Japan's attempts to divide the interests of the United States, France, and Britain in China, in order to destroy them in one fell swoop. Observers believe that the possibility of the United States, Britain, and France taking concerted action to resist Japan, or using this opportunity to issue a serious protest to Tokyo against the Japanese military's closure of the "Open Door" in China and the prohibition of foreign ships from navigating the Yangtze River, has now increased. It is generally believed that the United States may be willing to take anti-Japanese action after the governments of Britain and France have decided on a fixed policy towards the China crisis. The US government intends to wait for Britain and France to decide what strategies they will adopt to resist the Japanese military's attacks on foreign interests in China. Hull's public announcement is in line with Congressional instructions, as President Roosevelt has opposed Congress adjourning in mid-July before passing the government's proposed Neutrality Act. According to House Speaker Bankhead's declaration yesterday, the Bloom Bill, including Hull's recommendations on neutrality legislation, is expected to be submitted to the House of Representatives next week and, after a brief debate, is expected to pass. Isolationists in the Senate are still threatening to obstruct the proceedings. It is widely believed that Hull's public announcement is another step by President Roosevelt to convince Congress of the necessity of enacting flexible and effective neutrality legislation, so that the government can respond appropriately to any eventuality.

British Foreign Secretary States Situation in Tianjin in the House of Lords

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax stated the situation in Tianjin in the House of Lords today. He initially recounted the facts of the assassination of Cheng Xigeng on April 9, as reported in the newspapers, and the subsequent developments. He continued by saying that the British government felt it should not issue instructions to hand over the four arrested suspects to the Japanese, as this attitude was consistent with the practice it had adhered to for the past twenty-two months. The Foreign Secretary stated that the British government proposed submitting all evidence to a consultation committee for judgment, and the American government also agreed to send representatives to join the committee. After the British government made this proposal, the Japanese immediately implemented the blockade. The Japanese regulations for isolating the British concession were extremely severe. A British man named Smith was detained by the Japanese, and although the British Consul General applied for him to be handed over to British officials, he is still being held in custody. The Japanese have created various difficulties in inspecting perishable food transported into the British concession and ships arriving in Tianjin, including British ships. However, on June 18, two British ships traveling along the coast arrived in Tianjin via the Baihe River without being obstructed or searched. Another ship was only subjected to a perfunctory search. The British Consul General in Tianjin has protested to the Japanese against the insults to British residents, the search of British ships, and the interference with food supplies. The British Ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, also sternly questioned the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Foreign Minister Arita has agreed to investigate. Sir Robert Craigie further urged the Japanese to pay attention to the serious implications of the statements made by the spokesman of the Japanese military in Tianjin. The spokesman said that the issue in dispute could not be resolved by the extradition of the four suspects, and that the purpose of the blockade was to obtain broader cooperation from the British authorities in North China. The Foreign Secretary continued by saying that the British government has expressed its willingness to discuss any method that would achieve Britain's consistent goals in Tianjin, namely, to maintain the neutrality of the British concession and not to make it a base for hostile actions. The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has been working to explain the situation to the Japanese government. He also held discussions with the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, yesterday. The Foreign Secretary's statement adhered to the guidelines of Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)

Japan Prepares to Consider Local Solution

(Tianjin) The British concession has been blockaded for a week. During this week, the weather has been extremely hot, with temperatures consistently around 100 degrees. Although the British concession appears calm on the surface today, the tension has not eased at all. For those who cannot endure being trapped in a corner of the concession in this hot weather, there is now a possible escape route. Plans are currently being made to send a ship to carry those who wish to leave Tianjin to places such as Beidaihe to escape the heat, departing from Tanggu to Qinhuangdao. All passengers will travel by ferry from Tianjin to Tanggu. At the same time, according to a spokesman for the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, they are prepared to give full consideration to the British proposal to resolve the Tianjin issue through a local solution. However, this is only possible if the British unconditionally modify their attitude in North China and fully cooperate with Japan in establishing a new order in East Asia. The spokesman also criticized the news reports about Britain's willingness to find a local solution to the Tianjin incident, saying that no official information has been received regarding Britain's decision. However, if the British proposal aims to solve various outstanding issues individually, it goes without saying that Japan cannot accept it. The spokesman cited the extradition of the four suspects as an example of the above-mentioned issues, and said that what Japan seeks from Britain is nothing more than to ask them to unconditionally change their attitude and fully cooperate in ensuring peace and order in North China. The spokesman concluded by saying that it is a natural trend for the United States to be concerned about the developments in Tianjin, but the local American authorities are currently maintaining a calm attitude and have not shown any plans to resist Japan. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)

Japanese Newspaper Urges Continued Blockade of Tianjin Concessions

(Tokyo) The Nichi Nichi Shimbun published a commentary today, stating on the situation in Tianjin: Japan should indicate by its actions that if Britain adopts a policy of provoking Japan, it will only put itself in an unfavorable position. The blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin should continue until the British concession is reduced to ruins. If the British concession only exists in name and is no longer present in fact, we may find ways to make the French concession authorities improve their attitude and make the Shanghai Public Concession and other foreign concessions in China reconsider their current attitude of assisting the Chinese government in resisting Japan. The newspaper also said that foreign concessions in China have been a base for anti-Japanese terrorists and have allowed the free circulation of Chinese legal tender, which is prohibited by the "Provisional Government" in Beiping, thereby undermining the monetary policy of the new regime. Japan is now disregarding the enormous sacrifices of the entire nation in order to achieve its goal of waging war against China, and believes that it is crucial for the concession authorities to improve their attitude towards Japan and the new regime in North China. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)

Japan Cannot Retaliate Against British Economic Sanctions

(London) The Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, was recently commented on by the Manchester Guardian: "It is said that the economic pressure that Britain can exert on Japan may not have a decisive effect without the cooperation of the United States. This is not without merit. In fact, even if Britain takes economic sanctions alone, it would be enough to seriously damage Japan's finances. Furthermore, although Japanese spokesmen have spoken eloquently about retaliating if Britain takes economic sanctions, it is actually very difficult for Japan to retaliate. If it does, it will inevitably offend the United States, which the Japanese also know. As for Britain, its interests in China that could be harmed are very few. Other than attacking Hong Kong or attacking British merchant ships, which would inevitably lead to war, there is only Shanghai left. However, the United States also has significant interests there and may not allow it to be violated." The conclusion is that, "If the food supply to the British concession in Tianjin is not cut off, the blockade, even if it continues for some time, is unlikely to cause serious impact." Accordingly, a local solution to the Tianjin case is still possible. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

Local Translated News. Yesterday's English-language Ta Mei Wan Pao published an article by economic reporter Han Axule, saying that the British retaliatory measures against Japan, decided upon by the London Cabinet yesterday, will not be implemented immediately. The British government has not yet given up hope of resolving the Tianjin blockade through compromise and is only threatening retaliation if such an understanding is not reached. The British Prime Minister also stated in the House of Commons yesterday that he continues to believe that the Tokyo government does not want to expand the area of discord. It is almost impossible to understand what the British Prime Minister believes. Tokyo's diplomats are apparently secretly telling the British that if Britain does not retaliate, they will bring the Japanese military in Tianjin to reason. On the other hand, the local Japanese military is continuing the blockade of Tianjin and making threats, which is tantamount to insulting Japan. Japan is now repeating its old trick of implementing some arbitrary measures by the military while using diplomatic channels to cushion and apologize, so as to avoid retaliation. It is already known that Japan is still using this old trick to play with the great powers, which is truly surprising. According to Havas this morning, the three retaliatory measures that the British government is now considering are all detrimental to Japan's business in the British Empire. The fourth measure is aimed at the Japanese currency. However, dealing with the Japanese yen is expected to be more effective than restrictions on trade. Why not destroy the yen to stop Japan's continuous offensive against Western commercial interests in China? The yen is one of Japan's weakest points. Although Japan's foreign trade ranks fourth among the countries of the world, it is more vulnerable than any other major country in terms of trade, and its currency is extremely weak. According to the Bank of Japan's own announcement, the Bank of Japan's gold and foreign exchange reserves total only 501 million yen, which is less than 140 million US dollars. American financiers even suspect that the amount of these reserves is much lower than what is stated, and does not exceed 100 million US dollars. Japan is extremely short of foreign exchange and has long been desperately trying to obtain such foreign exchange by any means. The yen's exchange rate of one shilling and two pence is actually overvalued. Japan is in a state of ever-increasing inflation. Although the price level in Japan has been strongly suppressed by the Tokyo government, it is still constantly rising. Outside of Japan proper, the yen's inherent weakness has been clearly exposed. In Shanghai, the yen is at par with Chinese legal tender, with the pound at six shillings and fifteen pence. This is the rate of the yen in Shanghai, which is fifty to eighty percent below the official price. Under these circumstances, the British Empire's adoption of resolute measures against the yen will inevitably cause great damage to the Japanese currency.

Editorial

### The Advance and Retreat of the Tianjin Problem

To discuss international affairs with superficiality, some people like to talk about the issue of "face," believing that all causes and consequences revolve around this, and that once this is settled, everything will be easily resolved. This is a statement that can mislead the people of the world. Throughout history, there have been many examples of sacrificing substantial interests for the sake of "face," or of initiating conflicts and disasters for the sake of "face." But now that era is past. The wise do not value "face," and the violent do not care about "face" anymore. Some mistakenly believe that the problem still lies in "face," and thus go astray, misleading themselves and others, ultimately leading to the detriment of the country. The Sino-Japanese issue is a major international issue, a current issue of survival for the Chinese nation, and a long-term issue of benefits and harms for future generations. Yet some believe that resistance is a matter of "face" for China, and even lower, mistakenly believe that it is a matter of "face" for the Kuomintang, or even President Chiang Kai-shek. Thus, the aggressors disregard the sacred value of the essence of resistance and instead fall into a quagmire. Only the Tianjin issue today, after multiple analyses, has no reason to expand. If anything, it is only a matter of "face" for the Japanese authorities in Tianjin.

Why do we say this? Britain has long not valued "face." In recent years, from the signing of treaties and the treatment of ambassadors abroad, to small merchant ships and small businessmen, they have encountered various forms of adversity, which can be said to have completely stripped them of "face." The events are still fresh and can all be reviewed. Those who cherish Britain's "face" cannot bear to write about them again. However, Britain has endured adversity, handling it with equanimity, or perhaps taking pride in its wisdom, without realizing that it is gradually inviting humiliation. Those who humiliate them do so because they are seen as humiliatable, and thus become more and more extreme. Therefore, they blockade the British concession in Tianjin, treating Britain as if it were nothing. If the dispute over the issue were consistent in name and reality, and Britain's abandonment of rights and interests were consistent in all respects, then Britain's withdrawal from Tianjin would be like its withdrawal from Hongkou, and Japan's control of Tianjin would be like its control of Shamian. Past events have never led to so-called problems, so there would be no problem in Tianjin. Only without a problem, in addition to demanding the extradition of the four suspects, they seek to feel satisfied and to indulge their desires, listing six or seven demands. They almost hope to obtain in one fell swoop what their diplomats have spent years of energy and effort seeking in the international arena, and what their three armies have struggled to obtain on the battlefield in China for two years. The extravagance of their desires and the violence of their actions are truly beyond common sense and reason. Those who make such unreasonable demands so calmly can only hope that Britain will continue to abandon its rights and interests. How could they know that Britain can recognize that the essence of the problem is not just "face," and that the actual rights and interests involved are vast and broad? If they handle this problem while also indulging in the so-called "face," they will sacrifice substantial interests. Thus, they have aroused public opinion in Europe and America, and are planning economic retaliation. Their attitude is firm and resolute, something that has not been seen in years. Yesterday's news from London, although saying that Britain has not given up hope for a friendly solution and is still pursuing its gentle diplomatic steps, still holds two key points: one is that it will not allow the involvement of general concession issues, and the other is that even as a local incident, the British Consul General in Tianjin must confirm that the four people are strongly suspected. Thus, it can be said that those who act violently and make extravagant demands have no other hope than that Britain will continue to abandon its rights and interests. This hope has now been clearly dashed. Yesterday's news from Washington, Secretary of State Hull's remarks, explained that the interests of the United States, France, and Britain in China are actually common. And his aides further stated that the strategies of Britain, France, and the United States are the same. Thus, those who still seek to sow discord are also clearly hopeless. Japan has always despised Britain, not because Britain's strength cannot be despised, but because Britain's policy is to never gamble its strength over a matter of "face." But now that Britain, in view of its substantial interests, is actually hinting publicly that it will not hesitate to use its strength, it is something that Japan can no longer despise. Japan has always been wary of the United States, only wishing that the United States would not help Britain. But the United States, because Japan's past actions, although they have eroded American interests, have not directly threatened America's major rights, and because Japan's gold is running out but not exhausted, and is steadily crossing the Pacific to exchange for American goods, has been happy to compromise. But now Japan's gold is running out, and the Tianjin case has revealed its desperate situation. The United States will certainly act jointly with Britain and France, which is something that Japan is even more deeply wary of. Under such circumstances, to say that Japan has not yet given up its desired six or seven demands is impossible by common sense and reason. The other day, news from Tokyo said that the Japanese authorities' statement on the Tianjin issue showed a slight intention to move towards relaxation. Compared with the high-profile Japanese public opinion and the demands expressed by the Japanese authorities in Tianjin, there are clear discrepancies. Thus, there is still hope for a reasonable solution to the Tianjin case. What is unknowable is whether the Japanese authorities in Tianjin can not insist on their "face" and turn a major issue into a minor one. This is difficult to say. If not, the era of fighting for "face" has passed. What will be fought for in the future will definitely not be "face," but a firm pursuit of fulfilling their extravagant hopes. Given the international situation, we do not believe that their "face" will not be burdened by their extravagant hopes!

### Major British Newspapers Urge Government to Take Strong Action Against Japan

(London) This morning, all major British newspapers are calling on the British government to take strong action on the Tianjin incident. The Daily Mail said that Great Britain cannot allow trouble makers to gang up and control Tianjin. If Tokyo has no authority or is unwilling to restrain such people, then our only path is to take active steps to defend our interests. The News Chronicle said that the government should know that in this situation, the Anglo-Soviet agreement must be concluded as soon as possible. The Prime Minister reiterated to the House of Commons yesterday that this discussion is still ongoing. Now is the time to complete this task. The Manchester Guardian said that there is no doubt that Japan's responsible leaders fear Britain's economic retaliation more than they are willing to admit. It is almost certain that Great Britain cannot act alone and achieve immediate results. Therefore, without the cooperation of the United States, the implementation of economic pressure may not be conclusive. But even Britain's "sanctions" alone would be enough to put Japan's financial stability in a dangerous situation. To say that Japan is still financially stable in its current precarious situation is merely a polite way of speaking. If Japan can heed the only advice, and if the hotheads in the Japanese military can listen, then a local solution to the Tianjin incident is still possible, because the British government obviously does not want to provoke a dispute in the Far East if it can avoid it. The Daily Telegraph said that none of Japan's plans are without the British government's protest. The Prime Minister has stated that as long as the genuine hope of the Tokyo central authorities to stop the obviously provocative subordinates in Tianjin has not been extinguished, Britain does not want to expand the scope of political tension. The British government must give a chance to limit the dispute to Tianjin before taking the white economic plan. Unfortunately, there is no sign of Japan implementing effective restraint in Tianjin. The instigation against the Western powers is not only not localized, but is also spreading. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)

Morrison, a Labour Member of Parliament for Salisbury, recently gave a speech here, criticizing the government's Far East policy, saying, "What the Japanese are doing to us will make the former rulers before Prime Minister Chamberlain unable to rest in peace. The difficulties we are now encountering in China are a direct result of the policy pursued by Finance Minister Simon when he was Foreign Secretary in 1931. The only way forward now is for all peace-loving countries in the world to unite and form the most powerful organization in history, so that the unscrupulous dictators will be alerted."

### Arita Reports on Situation in Tianjin at Cabinet Meeting

(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita reported on the situation in Tianjin and the readjustment of trade relations between Japan and France at this morning's regular Cabinet meeting. Before the Cabinet meeting, Arita had discussed the European situation and developments in Tianjin with Army Minister Itagaki. At 9:25 PM, Prime Minister Hiranuma summoned Arita at his official residence to hear a report on the latest developments in the European situation. Hiranuma also met with Itagaki and is said to have discussed the latest developments in the European situation based on Arita's report. Arita also joined the meeting. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)

(Tokyo) After a meeting of the Cabinet and key government ministers this morning, Foreign Minister Arita entered the Imperial Palace to meet the Emperor at 2:00 PM to report on the situation in Tianjin and other foreign affairs issues. He left the palace at 3:15 PM and met with Prime Minister Hiranuma again to discuss the overall situation, departing at 3:30 PM. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)

### Britain Does Not Recognize Japanese Authorities' Right to Arrest British Citizens

(London) Conservative MP Graham stated in the House of Commons today that an official Japanese spokesman in Shanghai had said that Japan reserves the right to take immediate action against any foreigner they deem to be endangering the safety of the Japanese military in the occupied areas. Foreign Under-Secretary Butler replied that the British government does not recognize the right of the Japanese authorities to arrest or detain British people under any circumstances, and has clearly expressed this attitude to the Japanese government. Butler also said that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had seen the aforementioned remarks of the Japanese spokesman in the newspapers. (Reuter's dispatch, 19th)

### Germany Should Be Held Accountable for Japan's Actions in the Far East

(Paris) The newspapers here today continue to use large headlines to comment on the situation in Tianjin. Le Temps published an editorial, saying, "Japan's main goal is to occupy an absolutely superior position in China, so that other countries cannot compete with it. This decision was made because Britain abolished the Anglo-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and they wanted to find a way to retaliate. In order to achieve this goal, Japan is willing to try any method, and is also willing to conclude an alliance treaty with any country that is willing to do so." The actions that Japan is now taking in the Far East echo the actions of Germany and Italy in Europe. Tracing the cause, Germany should be held accountable. "If that country used one-tenth of its energy and resources to disrupt the European situation to peacefully develop China's rich resources, then Germans would have food to eat when they are hungry and clothes to wear when they are cold, and Europe would not be in danger of decline." Le Petit Parisien commented on a semi-official Japanese statement (which stated that the Tianjin incident could be resolved through negotiations, and that the demands made by Japan would not harm the interests of other countries), saying that the British government's firm attitude seems to have had a considerable effect in Tokyo. Japan's attitude is that it is moving towards compromise, so that the current dispute will not escalate. We can wait and see. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### Humiliation of British Residents in Tianjin by Japanese: Britain Lodges Strong Protest

(Tokyo) British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita today, for a duration of fifteen minutes. According to Japanese sources, the British Ambassador requested that British residents in Tianjin receive the same treatment as residents of other countries, stating that the Japanese authorities in Tianjin are currently discriminating against British residents, and daily necessities are now difficult to obtain in the Tianjin concession. Therefore, he urged the Japanese to leniently inspect goods transported into the British concession. (July 20th, Reuters)

(Tokyo) British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita today. It is reported that Sir Craigie protested in strong terms regarding the treatment of British residents passing through Japanese obstacles in Tianjin. (July 20th, Reuters)

(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, met with Foreign Minister Arita at noon today regarding the situation in Tianjin. It is reported that the British Ambassador lodged a very strong protest regarding the barbaric treatment suffered by British people passing through Japanese obstacles. (July 19th, Reuters)

(London) The diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph stated today that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax informed Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru last night of the British government's attitude toward the general situation in the Far East, and the extent of opposition expressed here to the generally irreconcilable demands made upon the Japanese government. Regarding the current events in Tianjin, the Foreign Secretary solemnly stated that the government strongly objects to the unpleasant news received of British women being subjected to humiliation and unnecessary strip searches of British residents. (July 20th, Reuters)

(Tianjin) Since the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin began a week ago, British people have been repeatedly subjected to insults. The British authorities have recently received reports of what can almost be described as the worst insults. In one instance, two British men were completely stripped naked by search personnel and subjected to desecrating treatment. Their clothes were then returned outside the search room, forcing them to stand naked in front of a crowd of Chinese people to re-dress. Chinese employees of the British Municipal Council, including police, received threatening leaflets. The Municipal Council is now facing a very serious situation. It is reported that these leaflets were sent out by plainclothes personnel from the Japanese military's special service department, stating that if they did not resign from their positions with the British Municipal Council, action would be taken against their families. The British Consul-General is now lodging a strong protest against this. It is reported that many of those threatened are seriously considering resigning, as most of their families live outside the concession and fear being harmed. It is reported that the Japanese have investigated and registered the British Municipal Council employees and their families living in areas controlled by the Japanese. (July 20th, Reuters)

### Sir Robert Craigie Clarifies the Situation to Japan

(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax received Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru at the Foreign Office this evening. The conversation lasted for one hour. Both sides remained silent about the outcome of the conversation. Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned the above-mentioned meeting when answering questions in the House of Commons, and said that British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, is also working hard to clarify the situation to the Japanese government. The British side's decision to take this step was determined by the Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee meeting at 10 Downing Street, with the aim of gaining a clear understanding of the Japanese government's attitude towards the British concessions in North China. The general public in London believes that the serious deterioration of British-Japanese relations last weekend was caused by the inclusion of external incidents in the original differences of opinion between British and Japanese authorities in North China on seemingly illegal issues. If both Britain and Japan can clarify the confusing situation and limit the discussion to simple points, it is hoped that both sides can achieve a friendly solution locally. (July 19th, Reuters)

### Ambassador Guo Visits Foreign Secretary: No Extradition of Suspects

(London) Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, visited British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax at 5:30 PM today and reiterated that the four suspects in the Cheng assassination case in Tianjin must not be extradited to the Japanese side. According to reports, Ambassador Guo had previously protested to the central government that extraditing these four people would be tantamount to recognizing the "Provisional Government" in Beiping. (July 20th, Reuters)

### Chongqing Municipal Government Enforces Strict Ban on Opium: Chairman Chiang's Order Implemented

(Chongqing) The Chongqing Municipal Government has, from today, implemented Chairman Chiang's order from the end of June to ban the smoking of opium. The eighty opium shops and nine opium wholesale dealers here have been ordered by the municipal government to close immediately and are not allowed to operate. The police, using the Baojia system, are conducting door-to-door searches of citizens to investigate those who smoke opium. Those who have already quit their addiction are being investigated. Those who have not yet quit will be sent by the Health Department to various opium cessation centers in the suburbs to quit opium. After quitting, they will be sent to labor teams to participate in the construction of greater Chongqing. Today, the Municipal Government also issued a notice to the citizens, stating that the deadline for quitting opium is only ten days, and explaining the meaning of quitting this bad habit. At the same time, slogans for quitting opium are posted everywhere in the streets and alleys, and leaflets are distributed along the way. According to reports, the Chongqing Opium Cessation Center can help more than 600 opium addicts quit each month. Before the anti-opium movement was launched last year, there were 50,000 opium addicts, consuming 6,670 pounds of opium per month. (July 20th)

### Since the Blockade of Gulangyu, the Food Problem Has Become Increasingly Serious; Japanese Consul in Xiamen Says Diplomatic Negotiations Will Reopen; Uchida Refuses to Disclose Instructions from the Japanese Government

Gulangyu: As a result of the continued blockade of this public concession by the Japanese side, the food situation has become increasingly serious. The authorities of Britain, the United States, and France have organized an International Food Committee to find ways to import food from foreign ships. The blockade of the Gulangyu concession began last Thursday, one day after Tianjin. The Japanese have banned the transport of firewood, charcoal, vegetables, etc., into the concession, and three Japanese warships are monitoring, preventing supplies from being transported here from the mainland. According to a Japanese spokesperson, Japan's intention is to make the Gulangyu Municipal Council realize the demands of the Japanese side. (July 20th, Reuters)

(Xiamen) Japanese Consul-General Uchida returned here on the 18th from Tokyo after discussing matters with the Japanese government. Today, he stated that he will reopen diplomatic negotiations at an appropriate time to resolve the Gulangyu incident. He was summoned back to Tokyo to report on the Gulangyu situation and to obtain instructions regarding the continuation of negotiations on the Gulangyu incident, but Uchida refused to disclose the instructions given to him by the Japanese government, only stating that Japan only wants the Gulangyu public concession to become a safe place for all foreigners to live, and not a base for the Kuomintang government's anti-Japanese activities. (July 20th, Reuters)

(London) During the House of Commons meeting today, Labor MP Mr. Balinger asked the government whether special arrangements had been made to provide sufficient food supplies to the residents of the British concessions in Tianjin and Gulangyu. Foreign Minister Butler replied that Prime Minister Chamberlain had recently made a statement regarding the situation in Tianjin. The food situation in Gulangyu is currently not serious, but there may be difficulties in the supply of firewood, meat, and vegetables. A food committee has been organized there and hopes to find ways to transport supplies from other ports by British ships. (July 19th, Reuters)

### Chinese Troops in Southern Hebei Fiercely Attack Daying

(Luoyang) The Japanese troops entrenched in Daying (south of Zaoqiang) in southern Hebei have been under attack by Chinese troops for days and are extremely frightened. The Chinese troops attacked again the night before last, first surrounding and attacking the Japanese troops in Luocun. After a fierce battle for a while, the Japanese troops broke through and fled to Daying. The Chinese troops followed closely and killed many Japanese soldiers. Yesterday morning, they launched a fierce attack on Daying, fighting with the Japanese troops for two hours, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. They are still in a standoff. (July 20th)

The municipal government has telegraphed the provincial government, requesting it to send personnel as soon as possible, so that the survey can begin after the provincial representative arrives in Chongqing. (July 20th, Special Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, the Chinese government is now planning to expand the urban area of Chongqing and re-divide the boundaries of Jiangbei and Ba County. A commissioner will be appointed by the Executive Yuan to work with another commissioner appointed by the Sichuan Provincial Government to carry out the demarcation work. The Chongqing police authorities have been ordered to increase posts to maintain order in the new and old cities. At the same time, strengthening government control over the entire city and the actions of citizens has also been launched. Effective air defense measures are also being promoted. (July 20th, Associated Press)

### Japanese Troops in Southern Hubei Ambushed and Suffered Losses

### British Warship Unloads Cargo in Wuhu; Japanese Authorities Protest and Demand Apology

According to the Zi Lin Bao, the Associated Press's Nanjing dispatch on the 19th reports that Japanese military authorities lodged a strong protest with the British naval authorities in Shanghai today, opposing the British warship HMS Scarab unloading cargo in Wuhu on the 14th of this month without notifying the Japanese authorities of the nature and quantity of the cargo. It is reported that a team of Japanese soldiers and officers attempted to prevent the cargo from being unloaded ashore, but were confronted by British sailors with machine guns. The Japanese authorities are now demanding an apology and a guarantee that similar actions will not occur in the future. According to the protest, the British warship's actions violated the agreement between the Japanese military and the British naval authorities, causing resentment among the Japanese military authorities. Only the patience of the Japanese soldiers prevented bloodshed. On June 3rd, the Japanese military and the British naval authorities agreed that if British warships wished to unload cargo at various ports along the Yangtze River, they should notify the British authorities of the nature and quantity of the cargo in advance. At 9:00 AM on the 6th of this month, the British warship attempted to unload cargo ashore in Wuhu without notifying the Japanese authorities in advance, which was a violation of the agreement. When the Japanese military authorities intervened, the British warship abandoned its attempt to unload cargo. Japanese sentries guarding the left side of the warehouse attempted to prevent the cargo from landing, but two boxes had already been transported into the warehouse, and another 145 boxes were unloaded at the entrance. The Japanese sentries immediately reported this matter. Ten Japanese soldiers and officers rushed to the scene to investigate, and armed British sailors confronted them with two machine guns, threatening them. The Japanese side believes that the actions of the British sailors were "very unfriendly." The Japanese side did not receive any notification before the ship attempted to unload cargo in Wuhu. The commander of HMS Scarab claimed that he notified Lieutenant Saito near the Swire dock in Wuhu on the morning of the 11th of this month. However, Lieutenant Saito did not go to that dock on that day. The British warship's commander has not yet provided any notification regarding the type and quantity of the cargo being unloaded.

### After Chongqing Suffered a Brutal Bombing by Japanese Aircraft, Aerial Defense and Evacuation Construction Were Actively Improved, and Economic and Production & Sales Plans Were Developed

Chongqing Correspondence: Since the brutal bombing of Chongqing on May 25th, the city has resolved to take action on Chongqing's air defense, evacuation construction, and central government news. Details are as follows:

Improving Air Defense

To prevent indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft and reduce the power of incendiary bombs, the Evacuation Construction Committee has long stipulated that narrow streets and lanes be widened to create "Peace Alleys." Sixteen alleys are to be widened to 15 meters, and sixty-seven alleys to 10 meters. However, progress was previously hampered by construction delays, and by mid-May, only two had been completed. Since the bombing on May 12th, demolition has been swift and active. As a result, upon entering Chongqing recently, all that can be heard in the streets and alleys is the sound of houses being torn down. According to city government sources, it is expected that this work will be completed across the city by around June 22nd. As for areas destroyed and burned in previous bombings, there are no immediate plans to rebuild. Construction will resume after the overall reconstruction plan is determined.

Chongqing has already built one hundred air raid shelters for passive air defense. It is now reported that another one hundred will be built to facilitate the escape of the few remaining residents during air raids. Furthermore, the local air defense authorities have decided to pilot the issuance of preliminary warnings to allow residents to evacuate quickly before air raids. In the future, whenever there is news of Japanese aircraft activity on the Sichuan border, this warning will be issued one and a half to two hours before the air raid alarm, allowing residents to evacuate at their leisure. This will be implemented within a week at the latest. After the air raids on May 12th and May 25th, traitors were discovered in the suburbs of Chongqing. Consequently, the Garrison Headquarters has issued measures for issuing residence permits and exit permits during emergencies, established inspection rules for land, water, and air, and restricted the movement of people. Anyone residing in Chongqing during an emergency must first obtain a residence permit. Inspection posts have been set up at all major water and land entrances to the city. Based on the inspection results, exit permits are issued or entry into the city is prohibited to prevent spies from infiltrating.

Efforts at Evacuation Construction

The Chongqing Evacuation Construction Committee, in order to meet the needs of evacuating the population during emergencies, has formulated measures for adjusting houses in the evacuation zones (number of counties and districts omitted) within each township and village, and is implementing these adjustments. The measures distinguish between houses in each township and village as (1) public houses, including ancestral halls, temples, monasteries, guild halls, and schools that have been closed; (2) privately owned houses, i.e., private residences. It is stipulated that when public houses are located in villages, the original residents will move into private houses in the villages. Monks and nuns in temples should find ways to consolidate and vacate. Those in towns and cities should either evacuate to villages or monks and nuns should completely vacate. Those occupied by the military or local groups should also consolidate and vacate as much as possible. All guest rooms, medical rooms, accounting rooms, and storage rooms in privately owned houses must be vacated. For families with few members and larger houses, the principle of vacating is that married couples are allowed to occupy one room, with children under ten years old living within. Unmarried people will share a room, with two to six people sharing one room depending on its size. The elderly, weak, women, and children who do not need to stay in the cities and towns should evacuate to the countryside. All public and private houses will be forcibly enforced by the county government supervising the district, neighborhood, and "jia" leaders. Those who are lenient or disobedient will be investigated by the county government and reported for disciplinary action depending on the severity of the circumstances. All vacated houses will be registered by the county government, and the rent will be assessed according to local conditions. They will be rented to evacuees, and landlords are not allowed to raise rents. When evacuees arrive at the designated evacuation sites, the district, neighborhood, and "jia" leaders under the county government will be responsible for allocating housing and guiding resettlement.

The New Life Movement Headquarters has selected two sites, each building twelve simple houses with five rooms each, to help the government evacuate the population, provide relief to refugees in Chongqing with productive skills, avoid unnecessary sacrifices, and increase production in the rear. These will be established as wartime production new villages, rented to various skilled production workers at the lowest rent as production sites. The villages will have public canteens, public toilets, and public bathhouses for management purposes, and the New Life Movement will be implemented to cultivate their collective living habits. Each village will have one chief officer and several officers to handle registration and sanitation matters. At the same time, in order to supply the necessities of life for the people who need to stay in Chongqing, and to help refugees with specialized production skills, so as to regulate wartime consumption, a certain location has been selected to prepare for the establishment of a wartime consumer market, divided into several units, and rented to various participating shops at the lowest rent. The market will also have one chief officer and several officers to handle management, registration, and sales matters.

Since Chongqing has suffered repeated air raids, in addition to the joint office established by the Party, military, and government agencies for emergency relief, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, in accordance with the government's intention to provide relief, have allocated a special fund of 400,000 yuan to jointly provide interest-free loans to disaster victims. Stores or small industries that have been destroyed or affected by the disaster, with capital under 2,000 yuan, who intend to relocate and resume business, or whose families have been destroyed and need funds to operate small businesses or handicrafts to maintain their livelihoods, can apply for loans. The Relief Committee has also established the Chongqing Small Loan Office to facilitate the livelihoods of poor and disaster-stricken refugees, allocating a fund of 200,000 yuan to provide small loans to poor and disaster-stricken refugees. It will officially begin operations on June 1st. Poor and disaster-stricken refugees who are engaged in small businesses or handicrafts, as well as other legitimate businesses that can make a living, and who lack capital, can obtain a certificate from the local government or social organization, as well as a sufficient guarantee, and apply for a loan from the office without interest or any fees.

The China Industrial Cooperative Association has recently been working hard to carry out this relief effort, registering people in preparation for introducing them to work. The association also provides assistance to small factories that need to relocate, as it is originally committed to providing loans to support industrial technicians in establishing various wartime industries.

Economic Construction

In order to develop economic construction and enhance the strength of the war of resistance, the central government has ordered the Ministry of Economic Affairs to establish a Cooperative Affairs Administration to actively promote and improve cooperative undertakings throughout the country. The administration was established on May 29th, and the director is Shou Miancheng, the director of the Cooperative College of the Central Political School.

The Agricultural Credit Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to circulate rural finance and increase production in the rear, has been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council to establish 100 warehouses and 100 treasuries in the northwest and southwest provinces. They will be opened in the shortest possible time. The supervisors and administrators of each treasury have been trained by the administration's special training class. The second session has now been completed and will be distributed to various locations to start work.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs has previously made efforts to assist and guide the cotton mills that have moved to Sichuan to resume work, and has done its best to promote hand spinning and weaving. The supply of raw cotton is particularly important. Recently, it has drafted measures to improve cotton production, promote the cultivation of improved cotton varieties, and stipulate that the guaranteed price of improved cotton produced in Sichuan this autumn will be 8% higher than ordinary cotton. The Agricultural Credit Administration is responsible for the cotton purchasing work. The quantity purchased will be allocated according to the number of spindles opened by each factory. The responsibility for losses will be shared proportionally to the amount of cotton used. At the same time, the Sichuan Construction Department will announce and inform cotton farmers that they should abide by the guidance, improve cotton production, and guarantee the higher price of improved cotton, so that the people of Sichuan will be happy to actively promote planting.

Production and Sales Management

The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently established a Cement Management Committee jointly with the Ministries of Military Affairs, Political Affairs, and Communications. Cement management will be implemented from June 1st. Zhang Zi, Deputy Director of the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office, will concurrently serve as Chairman. It is stipulated that the Management Committee may, when necessary, order cement manufacturers to pre-store enough cement for two months of sales to meet urgent national defense needs. Furthermore, it may, when necessary, comprehensively allocate cement and limit its price. When allocating cement for uses, it will be allocated in the following order: (1) related to national defense; (2) related to production or transportation; (3) ordinary. It is also stipulated that the cement price will be set once a month. When setting the price, the profit should not exceed 20% of the total cost and freight. The Ministry of Finance has recently revised the Outline of Measures for Managing the Export Trade of Tea throughout the Country in order to promote the export of tea, and has formulated general rules for the organization of tea management agencies in various provinces in order to increase production. The Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance is responsible for the overall management of tea purchases and sales in various provinces, and the China Tea Company will use its existing organization to assist as much as possible. The China Tea Company will handle overseas sales. The provincial governments will organize tea management agencies to manage the production and transportation of tea in various provinces, in consultation with the Trade Commission. The general rules for the organization of management agencies stipulate that key personnel in tea management should be jointly decided by the provincial government and the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance, and appointed by the provincial government. The management agencies may establish several sections and divisions depending on the complexity of the business, and may establish several offices at tea manufacturing or transportation centers. Their duties are: (1) handling the registration and loan matters of tea farmers' cooperatives and tea factories; (2) guiding the organization, equipment, and improvement of tea farmers' cooperatives and tea factories; (3) guiding tea production and improvement, and handling inspection matters; (4) handling tea transportation and warehousing matters; (5) assisting in the transportation of tea passing through neighboring provinces, and other related matters; (6) handling tea purchases entrusted by the Trade Commission; (7) other matters related to tea management. It is also stipulated that when purchasing tea, an evaluation committee should be organized to ensure the fairness of pricing.

News from the Aftermath of the Brutal Bombing

Finally, the reporter will briefly supplement the disaster and news from the aftermath of the fourth brutal bombing of Chongqing on May 25th. The number of demolition bombs and incendiary bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft on that day was no less than the most brutal "New May 4th." The affected areas were similar to the New May 3rd disaster area, and many places were re-bombed. Fortunately, the population had been evacuated as much as possible. Apart from many houses being completely destroyed or partially damaged, the number of people killed and injured was said to be less than 200. Three fires were caused by incendiary bombs, and the affected areas were fortunately not very large due to effective prevention and rescue. There were also three or four other locations that did not spread. Houses destroyed included the Chongqing Bank of the Bank of Sichuan Province, Tiger Brand Wing On Tong, the former site of the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office, and hundreds of locations, including parts of the (illegible) and (illegible) banks, and park buildings. Merchants and residents burned included Guangyi Bookstore and a portion of World Bookstore, a total of a dozen or twenty. It was rumored that a poisonous gas bomb had fallen somewhere, but fortunately it did not explode. The locations bombed repeatedly on the 3rd and 25th were concentrated around a certain Confucius Temple. After the bombing, none of the large temple buildings were intact, but the statue of Confucius still sat precariously in the temple hall, completely unharmed. As for the Japanese broadcast claiming that Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, had been bombed to death on that day, in fact, Mr. Yu had broadcast a speech at 7 pm on the 4th, strongly condemning the Japanese for spreading rumors. Furthermore, on that day, Japanese aircraft were shot down by the Chinese Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery, which was witnessed by the people in the suburbs of Chongqing. It is understood that one of them was a command plane with seven pilots on board, all of whom died in the crash. The fuselage was broken into several pieces. It was discovered a few days ago in a certain location 50 miles away from Jiangjin. The bodies of the pilots were found within three or four miles around. Yesterday (5th), the wreckage of the plane was transported from Jiangjin and will be publicly displayed at a selected location, replacing one of the three planes shot down on May 3rd that was recovered and put on display. It is reported that the plane was a Type 96 heavy bomber with the number 4173. A reconnaissance tool of the enemy commander was also found inside the plane, along with orders on how to command the bombing of the bustling streets of Chongqing. (June 6th)

### Drought in Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changshu

Ponds and Marshes Dried Up, Difficult to Transplant Seedlings

Zhenjiang Correspondence: It is the early summer season, already the season for farming, and farmers in the countryside are busy transplanting seedlings. However, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changshu, and other counties have not had rain for one or two months. There is no water in the fields, making it difficult to transplant seedlings. Many ponds and marshes have dried up. In the past, if this phenomenon occurred, motor pumps would be hired to draw water. Currently, diesel is expensive, and farmers cannot afford to hire motor pumps. The Zhenjiang puppet government has implemented rain prayers to fool the people. The puppet governor has banned slaughtering since the 16th and visits the City God Temple morning and evening to offer incense and perform three kneelings and nine prostrations to the Dragon God, hoping to appeal to Heaven and receive abundant rain.

### Lack of Copper Coins in Various Counties of Suzhou and Wuxi

Puppet Side Plans to Issue One-Cent Puppet Currency

Suzhou Correspondence: Copper coins and subsidiary coins were not originally lacking in the interior of Suzhou and Wuxi. Recently, Shanghai has suddenly experienced a copper coin shortage, which has spread to the interior. The number of copper coins and one-cent subsidiary coins on the market has suddenly decreased. One yuan in legal tender can only be exchanged for 290 copper coins, and it is refused to exchange for the full five yuan at once. At the same time, various tobacco merchants also believe that the lack of copper coins makes circulation inconvenient, so they plan to restore the money token system from decades ago. The puppet side has also suggested that the "Huaxing Bank" issue a one-cent puppet subsidiary currency to circulate on the market.

### Taixing City Market as Usual After Japanese Aircraft Bombing

Li Mingyang Allocates Funds to Relieve Disaster Victims

Li Mingyang Allocates Funds to Relieve Disaster Victims Taixing Correspondence: Taixing County was suddenly subjected to a wild rampage by Japanese aircraft around 2 pm on the 14th, resulting in the deaths and injuries of 20 to 30 civilians. Local authorities have provided relief separately. The victims have been buried, and the injured have been sent to hospitals for treatment. Although there was also an emergency alarm on the 15th, no Japanese aircraft were found, so the market has gradually returned to normal on the 16th. Li Mingyang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Subei × Guerrilla Area, has donated 1,500 yuan to be distributed to the Red Swastika Society, the County Hospital, and the Gospel Hospital to help relieve the needs of the bombed people.

### He Qingru of the Vocational Education Society Reports: All Cities in the States Have Vocational Introduction Offices; School Teachers Help Graduates Find Jobs

Educator Dr. He Qingru is currently in the United States researching vocational education. He previously recorded his research on secondary vocational education in the United States and sent it to various vocational education institutions in China for reference. The Chinese Vocational Education Society recently received a report from Mr. He on vocational guidance in the United States, which includes several points worth emulating. These are hereby published as a reference for those engaged in vocational introduction. All states in the United States have vocational introduction offices, located in major cities within the state. The state branches are directly under the central introduction office. The central and state governments share the cost of the state introduction offices equally, and the cities have no responsibility because the cities often have their own independent introduction offices that are unrelated to the state and city offices. The internal organization of each introduction office, in addition to the director and deputy director, is divided into two major sections: adults and youth. The adult section is further divided into labor, commerce, construction, and service groups according to the nature of the occupation (the types of occupations introduced are all described in detail and numbered in a special booklet). Each group has several interviewers who are responsible for contacting job opportunities, which are sought by the interviewers separately. In addition, there are several staff members in the office who are responsible for liaison. They visit various industrial organizations daily to promote opportunities. Those who need talent can be informed by the promoters to the interviewers of each group. In addition to visiting, the promoters are also responsible for various propaganda, such as newspapers and radio. The youth section cooperates very closely with the schools. Each year, in addition to the job introductions by the schools, the graduates are registered in the office to help them find jobs. The teachers of each subject in the school and the interviewers of the youth section are responsible for seeking opportunities. In addition to cooperating with the schools, they also have very close contact with the American Youth Administration, which is also responsible for youth placement. When job seekers arrive at the office, they are first received by the general receptionist, who asks about the type of job they are seeking and directs them to the appropriate group to wait to contact an interviewer. The registration form is filled out by the interviewer and then filed according to type. Therefore, one person can be listed in multiple occupations according to their training, experience, and interests, and they have a chance of being selected when there are opportunities. Employers mostly communicate by telephone, so there is a memorandum to record the essential details, such as the position, salary, and qualifications. Then, the information from the memorandum is copied into a formal job request form for reference. At the time of introduction, the most qualified registrants are selected, and several people are introduced for the employers to choose from. When sending registrants to contact, an introduction card is provided, along with a return card for the employers to decide whether to hire or not and send back to the office. According to the office's experience, introductions are more successful with smaller industrial organizations because larger organizations with complete structures often have their own personnel departments responsible for selecting and hiring, and do not need introduction agencies. This point is different from the situation in our country. The above is mostly for reference for vocational guidance work. It is hoped that those engaged in vocational introduction will pay more attention to it, and the establishment of public introduction agencies should be vigorously promoted.

### National Student Union Representatives to France to Attend World Student Union

(Hong Kong, 20th Dispatch) Lu Qinzhi, representative of the National Student Union, said that after the student representative arrives in Hong Kong on the 22nd by French mail ship, they will travel to France on the same ship to attend the third International Conference of the World Student Union to be held in Nice in mid-August.

### Students Continue to Strike at Diocesan Boys' School in Hong Kong

School Issues Final Notice

(Reuters, Hong Kong, 20th) The "political dispute" at Diocesan Boys' School, one of the oldest schools in Hong Kong, is now in a state of half-entertainment and half-anger. Several senior Chinese students are now on strike to protest the regular course exams. When the school's senior prefect is absent, Principal Goodbun has appointed a Taiwanese Chinese to temporarily serve as the senior prefect. Student representatives had previously discussed with Bishop Hall, Chairman of the school's committee, that if the school does not cancel this proposal, the students will strike. Although Principal Goodbun and Sir Kotewall, a leading Chinese resident of the city (Kotewall himself studied at the school), have repeatedly pleaded with the 120 striking students, three classes are now empty, most of whom are day students. Only 12 boarding students are absent. Goodbun has therefore issued a statement explaining that the appointment of the Taiwanese person is based solely on his personal qualifications, because the school's students come from as many as 20 or 30 countries. Therefore, he can only issue this in his personal capacity, and also said that boys of different nationalities in the school should continue their traditional habit of enhancing mutual understanding without questioning national policies. Even if the principal's approach is not popular, students must obey. The school has now issued a final notice limiting the striking students to return to school within a specified period.

### Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match to Resume This Year; Hong Kong Team to Visit Shanghai in November; Shanghai Team to Visit Hong Kong Next Year on Lunar New Year's Day

(Special dispatch from Hong Kong) Regarding the news that the Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match will resume this year, as previously reported, we now have another message stating that because the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match has been suspended for two years, it has been decided that two matches will be held consecutively, following the precedents of 1932 and 1933. The Hong Kong Football Association will send a team to Shanghai in November this year to compete, and the Shanghai Western Football Association will send a team to Hong Kong in February next year (Lunar New Year). At the same time, if the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation agrees, a team will be sent from the Philippines to Hong Kong in February next year to compete. In April, the Hong Kong Football Association will send a team to the Philippines in return. However, this matter is still under discussion. It can only be decided upon obtaining the agreement of both Hong Kong and the Philippines.

Another report states that last season's Hong Kong football matches saw considerable revenue due to crowded audiences, creating a new record in ten years. According to an official announcement from the Football Association, "The net profit from ticket sales for all championship matches last season, after deducting all expenses, was HK$7,448.70. Adding the current reserve of HK$4,637.18, the total is HK$12,085.98." The financial situation for the most recent seven years is listed as follows:

International Rules: To Be Modified

The Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match has been suspended for two years due to the Sino-Japanese War. It is now known that the Shanghai Football Association and the Hong Kong Football Association are actively revising the rules of the Interport Football Match and have decided to resume the match this year.

The point of contention in the rules occurred several years ago, namely "Can Hong Kong team players who work in Guangzhou or Macau, but whose families reside in Hong Kong, still represent Hong Kong?" Another key point for the rule modification is the prohibition of naval personnel belonging to the Hong Kong Football League from participating in Interport matches. Hong Kong had previously drafted a rule addressing these two points and sent it to the Shanghai Football Association, but the matter was shelved due to the outbreak of war and the interruption of the Interport match.

Recently, in order to resume the matches as soon as possible, Shanghai has agreed to most of the points raised by Hong Kong, but Shanghai has also submitted several requests to Hong Kong for consideration. If Hong Kong adopts its suggestions, the Interport match will be changed according to the following articles: (1) The "Interport Cup" will be an annual contest between Hong Kong and Shanghai, with the competition venue rotating each year, one year in Hong Kong and one year in Shanghai. Other ports are not allowed to join.

(2) Players registered with and recognized by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Football Associations may participate in the competition. This provision will resolve the current residency issue in the rules. (3) Each team may not have more than three army or navy players participating. This also provides a solution to the issue of naval personnel being prohibited from participating.

In addition, an important change in the rules is the method of resolving ties in Interport matches. Shanghai has proposed that the match be extended for 30 minutes according to the rules. Hong Kong seems likely to accept this point, but many Hong Kong Football Association officials prefer an extension of 20 minutes.

The changes to the Interport rules must be implemented after both the Hong Kong and Shanghai Football Associations fully agree. It is expected that the two sides will be able to complete the modification of the rules before the start of the football season this year.

Business News

### Finance: Cash Crunch; Gold Prices Decline Due to Exchange Rate Influence; Exchange Rate Arbitrage Available; Many Investors Taking Profits

Yesterday's black market cash transactions suddenly reversed and declined. This was due to the recent cash shortage and the exchange market interest rates offering arbitrage opportunities. Many investors took profits. Additionally, securities firms started reselling, and several gold firms also released holdings. The prevailing sentiment was that the prices had risen too high, causing buyers to be cautious during the decline, resulting in an oversupply. Prices once fell to a low of 2,657 yuan before recovering slightly. Trading activity was brisk, with approximately 2,000 taels changing hands. Jewelry gold shops also quoted a small premium of three yuan. Customs gold and pure Sino-British gold remained stable. Today is the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, and the market is closed.

Spot Price Also Drops One Yuan

From the morning, the opening price per tael (ten liang) was initially lowered by 15 yuan due to securities firms' desire to sell and weak consumer demand. A gold firm (representing a foreign firm) sold 50 taels to another gold firm (representing a speculator) at a price of 2,685 yuan. Subsequently, a cash firm sold 50 taels to a jewelry firm at 83 yuan. At that time, the jewelry shops' buying appetite was still good, leading to an upward movement. The jewelry shops bought 50 taels from a securities firm at 87 yuan. Then, money changers bought 50 taels from a securities firm at 88 yuan. After that, a gold firm (representing a speculator) suddenly changed its mind and began to aggressively sell at high prices, leading to a decline. A gold firm sold 50 taels to a jewelry firm at 87 yuan, and then sold 50 taels to a money changer at 86 yuan. As buyers gradually thinned out, interest rates fell by 6 yuan. A gold firm sold 50 taels to a securities firm at 80 yuan, and then prices dropped another 10 yuan. Money changers aggressively sold to jewelry firms at 70 yuan, and then pushed the price down another 10 yuan. A securities firm sold 50 taels to a money changer at 60 yuan, and then dumped another 50 taels on the money changer, with the price falling to 57 yuan. As selling pressure eased and consumer demand picked up at the lower prices, the market stabilized, hovering around 60 yuan. Near noon, a gold firm sold 50 taels to a money changer at 60 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. In the afternoon, the opening was flat. Initially, money changers bought 50 taels from a gold firm at 61 yuan. Later, money changers and jewelry firms successively absorbed more than 200 taels, leading to an upward movement. Money changers traded 50 taels at a high of 76 yuan. Shortly after, due to floating investors selling at high prices, prices immediately declined. A jewelry firm sold 50 taels to a money changer at 69 yuan, and a securities firm sold 50 taels to a money changer at 67 yuan. Later, a money changer came back to absorb supply, pushing the price back up 7 yuan. A money changer bought 50 taels from a cash firm at a price of 70 yuan. At the close of the day, a gold firm sold 50 taels to a money changer at a price of 2,660 yuan. As a result, the settlement price was 31 yuan lower than the previous day's. The spot price of the cash firm was 10 yuan higher than the spot price, while the current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. Inquiries revealed that few were opening new positions.

Jewelry Gold Marked Up by a Small Three Yuan

The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael at the beginning of the day remained at 273 yuan for major firms. At 10:05 AM, due to the weakness in spot prices, the price was marked up by a small three yuan. After that, prices varied slightly. Major firms revised the price to 270 yuan, while New Consolidated revised the price to 268 yuan, with a purchase price of 262 yuan.

Customs Pure Gold Remained Stable

According to a London report on the 19th, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce. As a result, the purchase price of Chinese cash at the Central Bank also remained fixed at 1,212.3 yuan. The listed customs gold remained flat at 2.396 yuan, and the Shanghai standard gold price remained unchanged at 1,207.6 yuan.

### Sassoon Aggressively Covered U.S. Dollar Futures; Though Settlement Volume Was Strong, Prices Ultimately Eased; Swap Arbitrage Decreased

In the foreign exchange market, HSBC's exchange rate announcement remained unchanged. In the black market for British and American exchange rates, due to a slight easing in British-Japanese relations, the exchange rate between Britain and the United States saw a rebound. As a result, the market in this city opened with Britain flat and the United States slightly firmer. Although foreign firms continued to settle contracts in the middle of the day, the market was maintained because foreign firms were willing to cover. In addition, U.S. dollar telegrams came to sell, increasing foreign firms' coverage efforts. As a result, the market once hardened to 12.6875 yuan, before ending with Britain flat and the United States firmer by 0.03125. The situation in the futures market was quite tight at the morning opening. The July U.S. dollar once broke into the 12 yuan mark. Subsequently, a Western firm, Sassoon, suddenly aggressively covered US dollar futures for June and July to the tune of 600,000 yuan, causing the market to become looser. In the end, prices recovered slightly. Swap arbitrage for spot contracts this month was at 3.5 points, while for June to July it was about 0.278 points, with a premium of about 0.04 points. The number of arbitrageurs decreased sharply, with most trading in futures. The Hong Kong dollar remained stable due to balanced supply and demand. Today is the Dragon Boat Festival, and the market is closed.

U.S. Dollar Futures to Reach 12 Yuan

In the early morning, London's prices for near and far contracts both contracted by 0.0625. The New York silver price was fixed, and the London gold price remained unchanged.

The U.S. dollar was up 0.0625 against Britain, up 1 cent against Shanghai, and up 0.0625 against France. The Central Bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same.

The banks' selling price for futures contracts was 6.3125 pence for the British pound and 12.3125 yuan for the U.S. dollar for the current month, and only 6.0625 pence for the British pound and only 11.875 yuan for the U.S. dollar for July. The banks' buying price was 0.125 pence different for the British pound and 0.25 yuan different for the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the futures market remained quite tight. At that time, foreign firms first came to settle contracts, with HSBC and McCallie settling contracts for spot British pounds at 6.5 pence. Subsequently, they also settled contracts for spot U.S. dollars from foreign telegrams and American banks at 12.65625 yuan and 6875 yuan. The situation was slightly firmer for Britain and the United States. When HSBC announced the exchange rates, they did not change. When the silver balance tax was announced to continue at a small 0.025, totaling a slight 2.75%, the Western firm Sassoon suddenly aggressively covered U.S. dollar futures, and other banks also slightly increased their willingness to sell, causing the situation to immediately loosen. Sassoon and American banks successively sold contracts for the current month's U.S. dollar to Chinese banks, hardening prices from 12.4375 yuan to 0.5 yuan. Then, Sassoon sold July U.S. dollar contracts to Yuli (representing the First Bank of Japan) and other foreign firms, hardening prices from 12.1875 yuan to 0.25 yuan. Near the noon close, Western firm Sassoon's willingness to sell faded, and futures prices trended softer again. At that time, foreign firms came back to absorb supply. The spot price for the Hong Kong dollar remained at 43.75 yuan, with supply from Chinese banks in Guangdong and foreign banks in the Netherlands.

### Discount Rate Jumps Wildly, Reaching 70 Yuan; Call Loan Interest Rate Revised to 25%

Yesterday, the discount rate for remittances and drafts continued its wild climb. This was due to increasingly tight money conditions and the approach of the Dragon Boat Festival, leading to a shortage of cash in the market. Those in need were eager to obtain funds, willing to pay high discount rates. Consequently, the discount rate per thousand yuan reached 64 yuan in the morning and soared to a final high of 70 yuan in the afternoon, a jump of over 16 yuan compared to the previous day. The call loan interest rate of the Money Trade Association was also raised by another 3%, to 25%, it is said.

Foreign Currencies Mostly Decline

Yesterday, British pure gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies rose by .0625. Foreign exchange banks in the local area were very active in settling accounts, and foreign banks provided smooth settlements, keeping market prices stable. Early in the day, the forward rate for British currency showed signs of easing, and gold shop customers emerged in large numbers, pushing the market price down to 15 yuan. Later, securities firms and others, taking profits, offered to sell, causing the market to decline. The tense situation of the previous day suddenly dissipated. In the afternoon, the market showed a recovery, with currency exchange businesses actively buying for their customers, while the supply was not abundant, causing prices to rise gradually. The market closed at 2669 yuan, a decrease of 31 yuan compared to the previous day. Foreign currencies, including British and American gold pounds, fell due to the cessation of the rise in the forward rate. The increased supply weakened market prices. British and American gold notes fell as the forward rate for British currency eased, and the near-term rate for American currency eased by .03125. Transactions were very active, and market prices declined accordingly. Hong Kong dollars, French francs, and Annam piasters all showed signs of easing due to the weak market conditions. The market for Japanese gold notes was stable, closing at 1.001 yuan. Korean currency was at .862 yuan. Trading by the association had not yet opened.

### Securities: Decline in Domestic and Foreign Bonds Unabated; Unified Bonds Each Approach the 50-60 Yuan Mark; London Foreign Bond Market Almost Universally Down; The Foreign Stock Market Appears Desolate and Bleak

The securities gray market saw very dramatic market fluctuations yesterday. Small individual investors remained extremely panicked. Although large investors and the financial sector did some buying, initially pushing prices up by one yuan, continued selling by floating speculators caused prices to fall slightly. Category A bonds broke through the 60-yuan mark, and the rest broke through the 50-yuan mark, without being able to stabilize. Investor sentiment was weak, and a rebound was unlikely until news became clearer. The reported news has not yet been confirmed as definitive. What is most confusing is that the wording in the telegrams is ambiguous. It is said that, for the sake of uniformity between domestic and foreign bonds, it is necessary to suspend interest and principal payments on domestic bonds as well, hence the Reuters telegram. However, news circulating from the financial sector indicates that each public bond will continue to be drawn as usual. Even though principal and interest are not repaid, the principal and interest can still be discounted at banks, so the actual loss is very limited. Therefore, after the close, market prices secretly improved slightly, by a few jiao to one yuan. It is said that Chongqing will remit the interest and principal to Shanghai, discounted at 85%. Yesterday, only one morning session of trading took place, with a total transaction volume of approximately 2 million yuan. There was no shortage of financial institutions buying, such as Xinfu, Xingyuan, Tongshun, and Number Four. At the opening, prices briefly rebounded by one to one and a few jiao, but due to selling by small investors, the selling pressure remained extremely strong. Lianhe further fueled the decline. Numbers 20 and Xingyu also sold more than they bought, causing the market price to fall sharply. Category A bonds broke through the 60-yuan mark, falling to within 57 yuan. Categories B, C, D, and E also broke through the 50-yuan mark, falling by another 1.6 to 3.3 yuan. However, after the close, because Yuanda 号 absorbed a large quantity, market prices rose again by about one yuan. A summary table is listed below.

London Chinese Foreign Bonds, quoted on Monday, the 19th of this month, all declined. The Guangdong-Kowloon Railway bond fell sharply by 3 pounds, to 15 pounds. The Longhai Railway (with stamp) fell by 2.5 pounds, also to 15 pounds. The Hukuang (German and French, with stamp) and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway bonds each fell by 2 pounds, the former to 16 pounds and the latter to 20 pounds. The Vickers bond fell by 1.5 pounds, to 13.5 pounds. The Reorganization Loan (British and French) and the Daqing Railway bonds each fell by .5 pounds, the former to 38.5 pounds and the latter to 18 pounds. The remaining bonds each fell by 1 pound (see the market price table for prices). British real goods for sale included 2,000 pounds each of the Reorganization Loan and the German and French stamped bonds, totaling 4,000 pounds. The selling price was 34.5 pounds each, a discount of 4 pounds from the British and French listed price.

In stock trading, 50 shares of the Zhongyi Trust Company were traded at a price of 8.75 yuan. The stock market of the Public Industry Association was weak throughout the day due to panic among investors. It seems difficult to return to normal for a while, and it will be necessary to wait until the Tianjin issue is resolved. The declines of various well-known stocks since the opening are listed below.

London British Far East companies' stocks, quoted on Monday, the 19th of this month, showed mixed trends. Both the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares rose. The British-registered shares rose by 2 pounds, to 80 pounds. The Hong Kong-registered shares rose by .5 pound, to 81.5 pounds. The Mercantile Bank shares continued to fall by 2 shillings and 6 pence, to 7 pounds 2 shillings and 6 pence. The Kailan Mining Administration shares continued to fall by 6 pence, to 18 shillings and 6 pence. The rest were unchanged.

### Cotton Yarn: Outside Interests Eager to Hoard; The Yarn Market Feels Increasingly Unpredictable; The Afternoon Market Will Be Temporarily Suspended Starting Next Month; Factory Openings Also Include Over 2,000 Bales

The yarn market is slightly mediocre, and the trend is still 常 忽靡常, sometimes up and sometimes down, making it very difficult to grasp. The general sentiment remains optimistic, but prices have already entered a high range. Gold shops and securities firms have hoarded large quantities of cotton yarn, providing strong support. Some wealthy individuals are even selling public bonds and switching to cotton yarn, which makes the market even stronger, increasing the number of chips traded on the table. At the same time, factories are opening up to meet demand. Also, the existing yarn market will be closed tomorrow, as usual, for a holiday. Business will resume as usual on the 22nd. It is also heard that the weather has been very hot lately, and the meeting places are narrow. It is proposed that the afternoon market be temporarily suspended from July 1st, to be restored to its original state when the weather turns cooler, it is said.

Early in the morning, the existing yarn market was reported to have a group of bulls making moves. 20-count double-strand yarn was bid at 3 yuan above the spot price, with 10 bales purchased at 510 yuan. Warehouse receipts were also offered at 502 yuan. However, the customer groups showed no response. Shortly after, it was heard that foreign exchange was unchanged, and gold retreated. In an instant, a wave of selling arose, and market prices gradually declined. 20-count Double Horse spot yarn fell to 502 yuan, and warehouse receipt prices were at 493 yuan. Subsequently, because the South China customer groups were uninterested in coarse yarn, and prices were high, investor sentiment was affected. Someone slightly pulled up the price and purchased a few bales. By the closing price, spot was at 503.5 yuan, and warehouse receipts were at 496 yuan. The afternoon session opened flat, and then the bulls re-entered with dozens of bales, creating another impression of strength and rising prices. However, customer group trading was not active, and prices fell again. The closing price for 20-count Double Horse yarn at the foreign warehouse was 504 yuan, and warehouse receipts were at 495 yuan. In the end, the various customer groups bought a total of 4,250 bales. Prices for 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 2 yuan, Shepherd fell by 7.5 yuan, Five Blessings fell by 5 yuan, Double Earth remained unchanged, and 32-count yarn fell by 5 yuan. However, 10-count coarse yarn rose by 5 yuan. Shenxin Factory opened 600 bales of 20-count Tiannv yarn at a price of 510 yuan, for delivery in August and September. Xinsheng Factory opened 200 bales of 6-count Red Wanzi yarn at a price of 260 yuan, and 200 bales of 7-count Red Wanzi yarn at a price of 340 yuan, for delivery from July to September. Chongxin Factory opened 300 bales of 20-count Dafa yarn at a price of 455 yuan, and 60 bales of 10-count Dafa yarn at a price of called by 112 yuan. Yong'an Factory opened 800 bales of 20-count Special Golden City yarn at a price of 505 yuan to 515 yuan, for delivery in June and July, with a deposit of 60 yuan per bale. The amounts purchased by each customer group are listed below.

The Japanese yarn market is increasingly showing a state of indecision. Because of sluggish real demand in the morning, 20-count Yueqin yarn for this month fell to a closing price of 417 yuan. In addition, the remittance discount rate has risen sharply, leading to a flat close in the afternoon.

### Indian Cotton Plummets; Traders Order 8,000 Bales

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was very quiet at the opening this morning. Prices fell because of sales by Bombay groups and the softness of Liverpool prices. The issue of agricultural relief funds in Washington has not yet been resolved. However, it is generally expected that it will be passed by the weekend. As a result, traders are generally taking a wait-and-see attitude. Later, cotton prices rose due to poor weather in the central cotton region, high prices in New Orleans, and increased yarn sales, leading to a shortage of spot goods. At the close, prices rose by 4-5 points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton has fallen sharply recently by over 3 rupees due to the deteriorating situation in the Far East. Egyptian cotton rose by 5-6 points.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Traders have had no transactions since the Shanghai exchange rate changed on the 7th of this month due to price discrepancies. However, recently, traders have almost sold out of their existing goods, and the selling price on the market is almost equal to the prices set by foreign firms. Yesterday, Indian cotton plummeted, and the converted price was very close. Traders inquired about prices from foreign firms, and traders' orders reached over 8,000 bales yesterday, most of which was West Indian cotton.

There was a slight business in local cotton, but the amount was very small. Only Huashang Xinyu Factory bought 100 bales, and Tonghang bought 70 bales of used cotton. The Indian cotton transactions of other traders were less significant, not as prosperous as before. Japanese factories also had no interest. 197 bales from the Subei source arrived in Tongzhou. The situation of existing cotton is recorded below.

### Piece Goods: Accelerating the Price Increase; Cloth Factories Require Full Remittance Head

Dyeing and Weaving Factories Specialize in East Asian Goods

The domestic cloth market was calm yesterday. Stocking holders' buying intentions eased slightly due to the tightening supply of cash. Yihua Factory increased the price of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao, and opened over 1,000 pieces of six-seven month futures. The Luo Shi market stabilized. Chinese factories also opened for sale of fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse twill, but with open prices too high, requiring an increase of 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao per piece compared to the market, cooling traders' buying intentions and reducing transactions. With the discount rate for cash remittances rising, each Chinese factory is changing the practice of a 30% remittance and 70% "remittance head" (extra fee) to requiring full "remittance head" for shipments. Among actual sales, colored twill is the best seller, with the Guangdong and Zhejiang groups actively purchasing. Dyeing factories in the local area continued to purchase approximately 400 bales of plain colored twill fabric from this factory yesterday, with prices rising by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao per piece. Other goods were flat. Yihua coarse cloth was sold in approximately 300 bales to wholesale stores on the street and traders, with heavy-weight canvas being the best-selling. Shipping to Fuzhou, Fujian has resumed, and customer groups are preparing to ship their inventory within days. The Yunnan group's demand has shown signs of recovery, with over 100 bales of fine twill, coarse cloth, fine cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, printed cloth, and satin being transacted, totaling over 3,000 pieces.

East Asian Piece Goods

Yesterday, white goods sales were strong for spot fine cloth, with futures rising by 5 fen to 1 jiao per piece. Fine twill rose uniformly by 1 jiao to 2 jiao, especially for under-grade Baobei and Shuangyu brand dyed blanks. Demand on this street was the strongest. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth spot goods still sold for 15 yuan, and for the next month, 15.35 yuan. However, traders' buying intentions were slightly sluggish due to the impact of the rising spot water for cash remittances. Nevertheless, the total number of fine cloth and fine twill transacted on this street throughout the day still reached approximately 1,000 pieces.

### The Unsuitability of Rayon Woolen Fabric

— (Shi)

In the Shanghai woolen fabric market, British goods used to dominate. In recent years, East Asian woolen fabrics have been extremely popular. At the beginning of the war, there were many arrivals (mostly untaxed). By the end of last year, imports continued to decrease. The main reasons are: (1) It is increasingly difficult to obtain foreign exchange; (2) The economy is turning difficult, and the textile fabrics must be mixed with rayon wool, which we are not allowed to export; (3) Smuggling is not as smooth as before. If you want to buy foreign exchange, you must contact Westerners or Chinese to be successful. It is quite difficult for Japanese firms to directly transport and sell goods from Hong Kong to Shanghai (the number of Chinese and Westerners being used by them is now small due to the change in the situation in China.) Also, because of the goods arriving in recent years, eight or nine out of ten are mixed with rayon wool, the reputation has been lost, and sales have decreased greatly.

Rayon wool fabrics are extremely uncomfortable to wear. It is the only product of a certain country, which other countries' merchants are unwilling to do. The texture is softer than Western goods, the price is cheaper and the colors are better, and it is quite difficult for non-experts to distinguish. When making clothes, the fabric will fluff up in ten days or half a month. When washing, even using both hands to wash too hard will cause the fabric to break, let alone using a washboard. A test can also be conducted on the spot: first cut a small sample from the store, put it in water or tear it with your mouth, pull it with two fingers, and seven or eight out of ten are as brittle as paper. The brittleness is slightly less after ironing dry. Therefore, friends who know how to calculate, if they don't wear woolen fabrics, would rather buy fabrics from dismantling traders who specialize in selling sample version fabrics, because they are all Western goods, the price is more expensive but more durable. Honestly speaking, three pieces of rayon woolen clothing are not as durable as one piece of high-quality British wool. However, dismantling stores mostly sell double-width yardsticks. Those with slightly more money can make two pieces of clothing on their own, otherwise, they can buy with friends, which is more cost-effective. Don't spend more than one yuan per foot to buy inferior rayon wool goods. If you can't afford British goods, it's better to buy genuine domestic goods (be aware that there are also counterfeit domestic goods). The selling price is not expensive, and the goods are authentic. If you want to be trendy, then that's your bad luck. But Shanghai's male and female customers only care about appearance, so how can they take care of this?

### Raincoat Fabric in the Rainy Season

Raincoat cloth mold makes it prosperous, and the selling season has now arrived. Western goods, due to the high cost of foreign exchange, such as single-sided open water goods, have risen sharply from 7.78 yuan to 9.23 yuan, and the market price per yard has also jumped from 8.5 yuan to 9.25 yuan. East Asian goods are lacking in the port, and the market price has also risen. Yesterday, first-class double-sided yarn raincoat cloth was wholesaled at 2.5 yuan per yard, second-class at 2.5 yuan, Baobelin sold at 2.75 yuan, and British-made all sold at 7.75 yuan.

### Grains: When Will Stocking Holders Stop Buying Rice?; Foreign Firms Peddling Saigon Rice; The Rice Market Will Be Closed for Two Days

Du Geng: After the market once turned flat before, it was still sluggish yesterday morning. However, because of the Dragon Boat Festival, the market will be closed for two days today and tomorrow, and many stores on the street added purchases, and stocking holders also made moves, so the situation became tight again in an instant. In addition, the sources from all roads are still sparse, only six or seven hundred bags arrived from Changzhou. The sellers' thoughts are quite firm, and the shouting is fierce. However, although the price of thick and thin geng rice has increased, it is not as much as in the previous few days, only a difference of 3 jiao.

Bian Yuan: Few people ask, the market color is still sluggish.

Ke Xian: Yesterday, both the ke market and stocking were quiet, and the market surface was originally stable. However, because this street will be closed for two days today and tomorrow, everyone bought before the festival, and the market price of ke xian rice rose together with the jingjian rice, rising 2 jiao more than the previous day. The number of transactions also increased to five or six thousand bags. However, the price has reached its peak, and people are not too optimistic. Du Yangjian and Bu Kejian followed the rise, varying from 2 to 3 jiao.

Foreign Rice: 300 bags of spot goods opened yesterday. Saigon Number One was priced as high as 23 yuan, because there are only a few thousand bags of foreign rice stored in Shanghai, so the market is easy to rise and difficult to fall. However, yesterday, Huashang Jianyuan and foreign firms peddled Saigon Number Two rice, which was only 22.6 yuan per original bag, equivalent to just over 18 yuan per shi in the market. Although the firm did not dare to do much because the price was too high, it was heard that a telegram had been sent out, and if it can become a reality, it will be beneficial to the future of people's food.

### New Wheat Arriving Vigorously; Flour Prices Rising

This Batch Has Been Changed to 4.65 Yuan Cash; Over 16,500 Tons of Australian Wheat Arrived

Flour: Yesterday, the market price of factory flour was raised again, because since the price of rice has been rising, it has attracted the attention of stocking holders inside and outside the industry. The local customer sales market has become active in recent days, and everyone has the intention to buy for stocking due to the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. However, the factory believes that prices must still be seen as high, and in order to prevent stocking holders from manipulating the market, they are still unwilling to supply as much as possible, so the customer board still holds back from opening, and at the same time the wholesale price on this street has been raised again, changed to 4.65 yuan in cash, which is good because the remittance discount rate has been very high recently, and the factory has changed to selling in cash. The total transactions included nearly 10,000 bags of local street retail and 20,000 to 30,000 bags of customer sales, mostly re-circulated goods being traded among themselves, and the market seemed very good.

Wheat: The source of new wheat has gradually become vigorous in the past few days. Nanjing, Puzhen, Danyang, Suzhou, Kunshan and other places have already been listed one after another. At a time when flour prices are rising, those who hold goods all want to see high prices. However, factory demand has not yet started, relying only on the attention of street and firm stocking holders.

### Abundant Funds, Stable Market; All Industries Pass the Dragon Boat Festival Safely; Silver and Money Industry and Market Closed Today; Citizens Decorate the Festival, Unable to Escape Tradition

Today is the accounting period for the Dragon Boat Festival, and the silver and money industry and various industry markets are closed. The financial market is as stable as ever, and all industries are sure to pass the Dragon Boat Festival safely. However, because of abundant funds, speculation is booming, creating soaring prices and distorted development of various industries. Details are noted below.

Abundant Funds; Financial Stability

Since the China, Central, Communications, and Agricultural four banks and the Silver and Money Industries Joint Reserve Depository have been making every effort to adjust and maintain Shanghai's financial market, it has remained as stable as ever. However, due to the massive influx of funds from the war zone, the current deposits of the silver and money industries have surged, and Shanghai's funds have gradually felt abundant, but there is a lack of proper use, creating a boom in speculative business. From foreign exchange arbitrage and buying and selling of foreign currency, red gold, and stocks to hoarding various commodities and renting and building real estate and houses, it is more prosperous than before the war. As a result, prices in the concessions are soaring and the distorted development of industry is running counter to the government's wartime financial policies.

Distorted Development; All Industries Pass Safely

All industries have been able to obtain considerable profits due to distorted development after the war, so the accounts released during the Dragon Boat Festival have all been able to be recovered on schedule. At the same time, firms and stores' loans to various industries have also been able to be paid off clearly, so this year's Dragon Boat Festival is very different from previous years. No unfortunate events have occurred, and there is no problem for all industries to pass the Dragon Boat Festival safely. However, although the call loan interest rate in the money market rose to 25 jiao yesterday, this is a phenomenon that must occur every year during the Dragon Boat Festival, because it is at the time when spring tea, new cocoons, wheat and other agricultural products are listed, and various industries need money to try to buy. The slight rise in foreign short term is in the cleaning. 1

Utilizing Funds; Moving to the Mainland

A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the financial sector yesterday that the financial industry is increasingly turning to speculation to make profits because of the difficulty of fund utilization. It is heard that the government will correct this, hoping that the financial sector will move funds inland, develop the southwest, and not engage in speculative business. It is heard that some financial circles have already studied how to utilize the surplus funds in Shanghai, focusing on the development of the southwest. At the same time, Shanghai, Xinhua, Jin Cheng, Zhe Xing, Zhe Shi, and other banks have actively started to add branches in the mainland in order to transfer surplus funds to the mainland, so speculation in Shanghai may decrease thereafter.

Citizens Decorate; As Before

Today is the old Dragon Boat Festival, and the residents of Shanghai have been unable to escape tradition, and have decorated quite a bit. The market is full of calamus and mugwort, and rice dumplings are almost a must-have for households. Liquors are seen to be selling a lot, and some halls hang Zhong Kui's ghost-catching picture to drive away evil spirits. In various ways, no one is second, but recently, due to rising prices, the cost of a feast is quite considerable, so it is not easy for residents to arrange the festival.

### Ding Geller Dies Tragically: Responsibility Determined; Death Caused by Neglect After Being Stabbed in the Abdomen by Japanese Soldiers: Verdict of the British Coroner

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, the British court this morning (the 20th) concluded the inquest into the death of Mr. Ding Geller, supervisor of the Lun Chang Textile Factory. Before delivering the verdict, Coroner Hayes severely criticized the Japanese naval landing party soldiers for their unnecessary and inappropriate actions after disarming Mr. Ding, stabbing and injuring him with a bayonet. Mr. Hayes stated regarding the evidence presented, "I do not wish to summarize all the evidence, only to offer some criticism. The evidence I have heard is the clearest and most egregious case I have ever seen."

The Coroner

Emphasizes Key Points

Mr. Ding was stabbed unnecessarily and inappropriately after being disarmed. Mr. Ding was injured on June 6th at the Lun Chang Textile Factory by individuals outside the jurisdiction of this court, and died on June 7th at the Country Hospital. His death was caused by the abdominal stab wound, intestinal perforation, shock, and blood loss. The failure to

Perform Immediate Surgery

further contributed to his inevitable death. Soldiers scaled the wall from adjacent land into the Lun Chang factory grounds and opened the main gate, allowing thirty strikers to enter. Mr. Ding attempted to stop them and was beaten by Japanese naval landing party soldiers and stabbed with a bayonet. Mr. Ding and two other British employees in the factory, seeing the approaching strikers carrying large sticks, took out handguns. Mr. Ding then waved his handgun at the approaching Japanese soldiers in a threatening manner, ordering them out of the factory. His colleagues calmed him down and were leading him back to the factory office when he was surrounded by Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers knocked the gun from Mr. Ding's hand and began striking him with their rifle butts and stabbing him with their bayonets. Shortly thereafter, Major Noji, commander of the Japanese naval landing party in Pudong, arrived on the scene. At this time, Mr. Ding had managed to stand up and was able to walk unsteadily. Unexpectedly,

He Was Again Assaulted

by the Japanese soldiers. Major Noji then approached Mr. Ding and began striking him on the shoulders and head with his sword scabbard. Mr. Ding was soon dragged to the Japanese hospital in Pudong, where his wounds received superficial treatment, and he was detained there for an entire day, until 10 PM, when the British Consulate-General was notified of his serious injuries. Mr. Thomson of the British Consulate-General, accompanied by a foreign doctor, went to Pudong and had Mr. Ding transported to the Country Hospital, where he died at 5:30 AM the following morning.

### Two British Warships Weigh Anchor and Depart

Cruiser "Cornwall" Sails to Qingdao

Flagship "Scorpion" Sails to the Yangtze River

According to the Shanghai Times, the British light cruiser HMS Cornwall, which had been docked at the British naval pontoon in Shanghai for ten days, weighed anchor and sailed to Qingdao yesterday (the 19th) at dawn. British naval authorities in Shanghai stated that the ship's departure was a routine movement. At almost the same time, the British Yangtze River Fleet flagship HMS Scorpion, carrying Rear Admiral Holt, sailed down the Huangpu River towards the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After the HMS Cornwall departed, the British pontoon was immediately occupied by the British destroyer HMS Dainty.

### Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance Strictly Prevents Income Tax Evasion; Tax Collection Agencies May Assess a Capital Amount of 2,000 Yuan for Taxation Based on the Average Turnover Rate

The Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance stipulates that the first category of profit-seeking enterprises is subject to income tax only if the capital is above 2,000 yuan and the net profit is above 5% of the capital. The original intention of this legislation was to provide relief for small businesses and avoid imposing excessive taxes on them. However, since its implementation, a small number of unscrupulous merchants have deliberately underreported their capital as less than 2,000 yuan in an attempt to evade taxes. Now, a remedial measure has been formulated, and the original order is recorded below:

Exploiting Restrictions, Deliberately Underreporting

It has been found that merchants subject to the income tax on the first category of profit-seeking enterprises often exploit the 2,000-yuan capital restriction, deliberately underreporting their capital in an attempt to evade taxes. The methods of underreporting include creating false records in the accounts showing capital of less than 2,000 yuan, or reclassifying part of the capital as received deposits or accumulated surplus, in order to ensure that the capital does not reach the 2,000-yuan threshold. Their fraudulent techniques are quite ingenious, and even with thorough auditing, it is sometimes difficult to detect.

Affecting National Revenue is Indeed Not Insignificant

If a remedial measure is not formulated, the impact on national revenue will be significant. According to the revenue statistics for various industries in the 26th year of the Republic (1937) compiled by this office, the average capital turnover rate is often five times. The profitability of capital should not be viewed solely based on the static amount of capital but should also consider the dynamic rate of capital turnover. Even if the book capital is less than 2,000 yuan, if the business volume and net profit are inconsistent with the general ratio of the industry, then the reported capital is not entirely accurate. To prevent clever tax evasion and ensure fairness, this office has

Adopted Regulations, Levying Taxes According to Rates

In accordance with Article 12 of the Provisional Regulations and Interpretation Order No. 44, tax collection agencies may, based on the business situation and the average capital turnover rate of the industry in the previous year, directly determine the capital amount to be 2,000 yuan and levy taxes according to rates, in order to prevent tax evasion and increase resources for the war effort. In addition to reporting to the Ministry for record-keeping and issuing separate orders to various departments and sub-departments, this order is issued to the relevant department to ensure compliance and diligent tax collection.

### Prices of Various Industries Continue to Rise, the Lives of Ordinary People are Increasingly Difficult; Ordinary Restaurants Raise Prices by 10% to 20%, Unable to Provide Change, and Change Money Codes to Foreign Codes

Since the tightening of foreign exchange controls, the prices of various imported goods have soared. Moreover, unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to raise the prices of essential domestic goods such as rice and firewood. Therefore, ordinary restaurants in the city also raised prices for food and drinks yesterday, by 10% to 20%. Furthermore, due to the shortage of copper coins, it is impossible to provide change, so change money codes have been changed to foreign codes, which has a significant impact on the lives of ordinary people. As for other industries, the following announced price increases yesterday: (1) Shanghai Coal Dealers, (2) Mobil Oil, (3) Asiatic Petroleum, (4) Continental Wire Factory, (5) Da Guangming Machine-Made Glass Factory, (6) Yu Feng Soap Factory, (7) Ming Hua Towel Factory, (8) Jing Cheng Glass Factory, (9) Mei Sheng Chemical Factory, (10) Xin Sheng Machine-Made Button Factory, (11) Hong Yu Partridge Dishes, (12) Alcohol Manufacturing Joint Association, (13) Electrical Silk Weaving Industry, (14) Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry, (15) Yong Hua Hardware Factory, (16) Mei Xin Bakelite Factory, etc. The average increase ranged from 10% to 30%, which poses a serious threat to the livelihoods of ordinary people. Therefore, all sectors deeply hope that the concession authorities will quickly implement effective measures to curb this trend, so as to avoid affecting the stability of social order.

### A Meaningful Pamphlet: "America's Disgrace"; Americans Condemn Arms Shipments to Japan; Shanghai Has Received This Pamphlet

According to the Continental News, a new pamphlet is circulating in the United States, stating that American merchants shipping war materials to Japan is "America's Disgrace", and urging an embargo on Japan, supporting Thomas's amendment to the Neutrality Act, and criticizing the United States as an accomplice to Japanese aggression. Shanghai has also received this pamphlet. A portion of the full text states that China is fighting to maintain its national independence, which has aroused worldwide sympathy and assistance from the people of democratic countries. Our country (referring to the United States below)

Extends Credit Loans

to China, which is evidence of this sympathy. However, despite this action, in the eyes of the world, our country is still considered an accomplice to Japanese aggression. Facts show that the United States is guilty. This cannot be concealed by the fact that Americans resent fascist aggression and have conclusive evidence. The supplies provided by the United States to the Japanese army include: (1) 100% of the gasoline, used to power the motors of its combat weapons, (2) 93% of the copper, used to manufacture bullets, (3) 91% of the trucks, which are motorized

Transportation Equipment

(4) 60% of the kerosene, (5) 41% of the pig iron, used to manufacture cannons, (6) 48% of the machinery, used to manufacture munitions, and (7) 60% of the scrap iron, used to manufacture bombs and shells, wantonly slaughtering people. In addition to providing deadly military equipment to the Japanese aggressors, the United States also purchases Japanese goods, providing this war-crazed nation with tens of millions of dollars annually. Japan uses the profits

Gained from This Trade

to purchase more military supplies. This is truly America's Disgrace. Today, we continue to partner with Japanese warlords in their business of death and destruction. Our traditional sense of fair dealing has been violated. The people of our country truly want peace and not war, etc. According to records, this pamphlet was issued by the "American Friends of the Chinese People Association" at 168 West 23rd Street, New York.

### Large Quantities of Domestic Goods Samples Shipped to Southeast Asia

Numbering Over Five or Six Hundred Pieces

Shipping Procedures are Currently Being Processed

Domestic goods groups in the city, such as the Shanghai General Federation of Chinese Industries, the United Federation of Chinese Domestic Manufacturers, and the United Federation of Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factories, received a notice from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to collect fine domestic goods samples from large and small domestic goods factories in the city to be shipped to various territories in Southeast Asia for display, in order to develop domestic goods sales. The above domestic goods groups jointly handled the collection matters in early May, under the auspices of the Shanghai General Federation of Chinese Industries. It is now known that the domestic goods samples have been collected and shipping procedures are currently being processed, and will be shipped within the next three or four days. It is reported that the number of samples collected will be over five or six hundred pieces, and are very exquisite. Once shipped to Southeast Asia, they will surely arouse the love of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia for domestic goods.

### American Destroyer Departs, Collides and Sinks a Fishing Boat

Six American destroyers, numbered 211, 213, 217, 219, 224, and 236, which had been docked at pontoons 30, 30, 32, and 3 of Yangshupu, weighed anchor and departed one after another the day before yesterday. At about 1 PM that afternoon, after the destroyer 213 set sail and sailed downstream, it had just reached the Donggou section of the river when a privately-owned cargo sailboat fully loaded with fresh fish sailed upstream towards Shanghai. They collided head-on and could not avoid each other. The fishing boat was rammed amidships by the destroyer, and immediately split into two sections. The cargo and boat sank together, and all six crew members fell into the water at the same time. Fortunately, they were rescued one by one, but one of them had been injured, with his head bleeding. After the accident, the destroyer temporarily stopped sailing to ascertain the extent of the damage before continuing its departure. As for the damaged fishing boat, the front half could still be seen protruding from the water in the center of the river yesterday, while the back half was dragged to the Pudong beach and stranded.

### Securities Prices Continue to Fall, Trading Halted for Half a Day Yesterday; This Phenomenon is Entirely Due to Nervous Sentiment; The Government Must Have a Way to Maintain Credit

The Ministry of Finance has always been consistent in maintaining credit. Although customs duties in the occupied areas have been intercepted, there are already measures in place for domestic debt secured by customs duties, in order to avoid affecting the financial market. Repayment of principal on the National Rehabilitation Bonds and Gold Construction Bonds will continue as usual through lottery drawings. However, trading in the unofficial Shanghai securities market continued to decline yesterday. Details are as follows:

Prices of Various Bonds Continue to Fall

The unofficial Shanghai securities market

has been unified since the day before yesterday. Due to the telegram announcing the suspension of principal and interest payments, prices plummeted. Yesterday morning, rumors continued to spread, and nervous sentiment led to continued declines in prices. At closing, Class A Unified Bonds closed at 56.8 yuan, down 3.25 yuan; Class B at 49.4 yuan, down 1.6 yuan; Class C at 48.5 yuan, down 1.75 yuan; Class D at 46.6 yuan, down 3.3 yuan; and Class E at 47.9 yuan, down 2.35 yuan. Trading was halted in the afternoon because today is the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, and there was insufficient time to settle the traded bonds. In addition, due to the large fluctuations in the bond market, a temporary announcement was made to halt trading for half a day.

In the Past, The Government Advanced Payments on Various Bonds

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Ministry of Finance had issued a notice on January 15th, stipulating the methods for repaying various bonds secured by customs duties thereafter. According to the regulations, now that customs revenues in the occupied areas have been intercepted, and the customs revenues in the non-occupied areas are insufficient to repay foreign debts, domestic debt secured by surplus customs revenue should not be overdrawn and payments on their principal and interest should be suspended. However, in order to maintain credit, the Ministry of Finance still advances payments on the Unified, National Rehabilitation, and Gold Construction bonds that have matured in the past, and continues to repay principal and interest as usual, without suspending payments on the principal and interest of domestic debt due to the interception of customs revenues.

There are Already Measures in Place for the Principal and Interest of Unified Bonds

The principal and interest of the Unified Bonds maturing on July 31st of this year, totaling 56,600,350 yuan, will be affected if payments of principal and interest are suspended. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China and the National Debt Fund Management Committee have not received orders from the Ministry of Finance. Although the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China has telegraphed Chongqing for clarification, it has not received a reply. Therefore, as of last night, it was still impossible to confirm. However, if payments of principal and interest are suspended, it will have a significant impact on the financial market. It is said that there are measures in place to maintain credit, which will be announced by the Ministry of Finance at that time. In short, it will be maintained to the extent possible.

National Rehabilitation Bonds and Gold Construction Bonds Will be Drawn Regularly

The National Debt Fund Management Committee will continue to draw lots for bonds secured by customs duties as usual. The seventh drawing of the National Rehabilitation Bonds will be held on July 10th, drawing five numbers, with payments made by the Central Bank on August 31st. The twelfth drawing of the Financial Gold Construction Bonds will be held on September 10th, drawing twenty-five numbers, with payments made by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications and the Agricultural Bank on September 30th. It is said that banking circles are unable to comment on the credit maintenance measures for various bonds secured by customs duties formulated by the Ministry of Finance before they are announced. It is impossible to know whether "approval certificates for foreign exchange remittances" will be issued and whether banks will be allowed to "negotiate loans" at this time.

### Coal Prices Soar, Shipping Fares Increase

Current Shipping Fares

Are Double Pre-War Rates

Amidst the tightening of foreign exchange and soaring coal prices, shipping fares and ticket prices are also increasing. In addition to the British companies Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson, which have officially announced that starting from the 22nd, shipping fares and ticket prices for their coastal liners traveling to the North and South Seas will be calculated according to new prices, which are approximately 20% higher than previous rates. The German company Far Eastern Navigation, along with Reiwa Yoko, Ludewig & Co., and the Italian company Yi Hua Yang Xing, which operate the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, held a meeting at 2 PM on the 19th. As a result of the discussions, due to rising coal prices, in order to maintain costs, starting from the 22nd, ticket prices will be increased by 2 yuan for steerage, 3 yuan for cabin class, 4 yuan for official class, and 5 yuan for first class. Shipping fares will be determined after further discussions. It is also learned that ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route will also increase shipping fares and ticket prices. The new rates are currently more than double pre-war rates.

### Lun Chang Factory Workers Eager for Resumption of Work

The labor-management dispute at the British-owned Lun Chang Textile Factory in Pudong has remained unresolved for a month as of yesterday (the 20th). It is now heard that the striking workers are eager to resume work as soon as possible due to financial difficulties. Zhu Yuzhen, the puppet "Director of the Pudong District Office," also intends to lead "activists from the Workers' League" to the factory today to feign negotiations for a solution. Therefore, the stalemate situation has eased compared to before.

### Rice Industry Representatives Request Crackdown on Speculation and Manipulation; Visit He Dequi, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council; Suggest Effective Measures to Maintain Food Supply

Rice Prices Rose Again Yesterday

Speculation in the Shanghai Bean and Rice Market has caused an unjustified surge in rice prices, affecting the livelihoods of citizens and social stability. The rice industry groups sent representatives to visit the concession authorities yesterday to suggest measures. The Market Management Committee will invite businesses tomorrow to advise them to maintain the food supply. Details are as follows:

Visiting the Authorities, Suggesting Measures

The Bean and Rice Trade Association, the Rice Dealers Association, and other groups sent four representatives, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Fu Qiangeng, and Zhang Nianxuan, to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement at 11 AM yesterday to visit Deputy Director He Dequi, report the reasons for the surge in rice prices, and request that the concession authorities take measures to crack down on speculation and manipulation, facilitate the source of domestic rice, and adopt effective measures to stabilize rice prices. Deputy Director He agreed to submit the rice industry's requests to the Grain Management Committee for research and handling.

Hoarders Continue to Buy Up Rice, Prices Rise Again

After the Bean and Rice Market opened yesterday, hoarders continued to buy up rice, causing prices to rise again. A total of more than 7,000 bags were traded. Changshu Zhenbai japonica rice even broke the 22-yuan mark, and Jiangyin Dingbai japonica rice was 21.8 yuan. Prices have reached record highs. Market transactions were extremely chaotic, and the Management Committee stated that it was unable to suppress prices. The market will be closed for two days starting today for Dragon Boat Festival settlement and will reopen for trading on the 23rd. Most of the rice traded previously was settled before the Dragon Boat Festival.

Market Meeting to Maintain the Food Supply

The Market Management Committee, recognizing that the surge in rice prices has a significant impact on citizens' livelihoods, has scheduled a meeting with various businesses for 3 PM tomorrow (the 22nd). In addition to discussing internal affairs, they will also advise businesses to find ways to stabilize rice prices and maintain the food supply. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency who interviewed a rice industry representative, the rice industry groups were unable to prevent the surge in rice prices due to limited power. Therefore, they suggested that the concession authorities adopt effective measures. They have decided to wait for the measures of the concession authorities.

There is No Fear of Food Shortages for Shanghai Citizens

Regarding rice stocks in Shanghai, there are still 523,822 bags, which is enough to maintain the food supply for two months. Moreover, although it is impossible to investigate, it is estimated that a significant number of citizens have pre-purchased rice. The rice blocked in Wuxi has reportedly been properly negotiated and has been released to Shanghai. Although Suzhou and Wuxi have banned exports, a small amount is still being transported. For example, on the 19th, 22 train cars and 2,500-2,600 bags were transported by ship. Land and water routes brought in more than 2,000 bags yesterday. Therefore, the supply has not actually been cut off.

Supervise the Market, Restrict Price Increases

According to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the rice industry groups previously had a rule that prices should not exceed a limit of 15 yuan in order to prevent rice market price increases, but it was cancelled because it could not be enforced. Currently, the rising prices are almost impossible to control. Major rice industry figures have agreed to adopt restrictive measures, stipulating that if rice prices rise due to a shortage of supply, each increase should not exceed 3 jiao. The next day's rice prices will be posted in the market, and the concession authorities will be asked to send personnel to supervise. Those who exceed the regulations will be severely punished. The implementation of this measure is to avoid unlimited price increases.

### British Warships Purchasing Food on the Yangtze River Threatened by Japanese Gunboats; Six Shells Fly Over the Bow of the British Warship; Could Lead to a Second Panay Incident

According to the Continental News, the British gunboat HMS Gnat, while patrolling the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, often purchases products from farmers on both banks of the Yangtze River tributaries that lead to Haimen. On the 9th of this month, while conducting a routine patrol in the lower reaches of the river, it anchored opposite the south bank of the Yangtze River, relative to that tributary. When

A Large Sampan

carrying 3,000 eggs and 30 chickens, which had been pre-ordered by the HMS Gnat, approached the British warship to unload the food, a Japanese gunboat, which had been secretly moored nearby on the north bank of the river, sailed to the middle of the river and

Fired Six Shells

over the bow of the British warship, clearly targeting the sampan and attempting to prevent it from transporting food onto the British warship. At times, it seemed that a tragedy similar to the Panay incident was likely to occur. However, the sampan

Was Not Hit

and safely unloaded the eggs and chickens before sailing into the tributary and hiding. After the sampan disappeared, the Japanese gunboat fired two more shells at the mouth of the tributary, clearly warning the sampan not to approach the British warship again. On both banks of the tributary, there was

A Guerrilla Unit

that the crew of the British warship was unaware of. Moreover, a certain captain of the guerrilla unit was also on the sampan, unloading the eggs and chickens onto the British warship. It is believed that the Japanese did not know that he was also on the sampan.

### More Chinese Arrested in the Hongkou District

Da Guangshe reports that the Japanese military in Hongkou has recently been conducting inspections in the district under the pretext of "searching for unstable elements." They have dispatched large numbers of military police and plainclothes personnel, subjecting Chinese people to various forms of harassment. Those who delay answering questions are often beaten and humiliated. They also intrude into residents' homes and shops, conducting arbitrary searches, causing great distress to residents. At about 8 AM yesterday, two Chinese men resembling laborers were arrested by Japanese soldiers while passing near the Zhapu Road bridge. At the same time, a Chinese man was also arrested on Xihuaide Road for unknown reasons.

### Ministry of Finance Telegram Clarifies Exchange Rate Between Legal Tender and Foreign Currencies

Any Disputes Must be Interpreted by

Judicial Organs

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Knitting Industry Association requesting clarification on the Ministry of Finance's telegram Yuqianhui No. 1548, issued last October, which stated, "In all contracts specifying payment in foreign currency converted from legal tender, the exchange rate published by the Central Bank on that day shall prevail." The association requested clarification as to whether this telegram applied to judgments made by judicial organs. The Chamber forwarded this telegram to the Ministry of Finance for clarification. The Ministry has now replied by telegram, which is being forwarded to the Knitting Industry Association. The telegram states, "We received the telegram from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on the 17th of this month, Yuqianzi. Having reviewed your telegrams from the 5th, concerning silk production and the song and dance troupes, we find that the Ministry's instructions in the aforementioned telegram issued last October were proper instructions regarding the current financial system, and not legal provisions. Any disputes must be interpreted by judicial organs. These proper instructions should be followed consistently whenever questions arise regarding the exchange rate between legal tender and foreign currencies. Courts at all levels should apply these instructions uniformly. Apart from the submission to the Executive Yuan and the consultation with the Judicial Yuan regarding the dissemination of this information to all levels of the courts, this telegram serves to inform and notify you."

### Safety Campaign Proves Effective, Traffic Accidents Greatly Reduced; Concession Authorities Are Extremely Pleased, Hoping That Citizens Will Always Be Cautious

Yesterday was the third day of the Road Safety Campaign Promotion Week. Boy Scouts responsible for the promotion went to various roads in the Northern District (north of Suzhou Creek) to carry out promotional activities. Lecturers gave speeches at public gathering places such as amusement grounds, docks, and parks. Although it drizzled in the afternoon, it did not interrupt the activities. Members of various comedy troupes also incorporated the key points of road safety into their performances and broadcasts, which was especially commendable. Safety films and statistical slideshows of traffic accident cases continued to be screened in various cinemas. Cases of traffic accidents, which were previously almost daily occurrences, have greatly decreased since the start of the Road Safety Campaign. Therefore, the two concession authorities have expressed extreme satisfaction with this and hope that citizens will always be cautious and adhere to safety rules.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Seeks to Effectively Prevent Factory Accidents: Invites Factory Owners of Various Industries to Hold Meetings to Improve Equipment Separately to Ensure Safety

Due to the surge in industrial accidents, the Factory Management Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council invited relevant industries to hold meetings to seek remedies. The following are the details reported by a reporter from Da Guang News Agency:

Accidents Increased Sharply Last Month

According to the section's report on industrial and occupational accidents reported in May, there were a total of 223 cases, including 7 fatalities. There were also 16 female workers injured, which is more than in April. The section sent personnel to investigate separately and provided guidance on prevention and improvement methods to enhance the safety of workers. Among them, 39 cases occurred in machinery and hardware industries, 37 in transportation industries, 36 in weaving industries, 18 in construction industries, 11 in printing industries, and the rest in other industries. The causes included 56 cases related to machinery power, 57 cases of falls, 29 cases of being injured by falling objects, and the rest involved electric shock, polishing belts, etc. As for fire incidents, there were a total of 31 cases, resulting in 10 injuries and 3 fatalities. The highest number of incidents occurred in machinery and hardware factories, with 8 cases, followed by 7 cases in weaving factories, 4 in chemical plants, and 3 each in celluloid and woodworking factories. The remaining cases occurred in printing and dry-cleaning factories. In addition, some straw hat businesses have been spraying celluloid on paper hat blanks in crowded residential buildings, which is extremely dangerous. In recent months, several factories have experienced fires due to spraying paint, resulting in the deaths of 18 workers. At the same time, accidents and fires have also occurred frequently in factories using voltage machines and manufacturing flashlight bulbs.

Inviting Various Industries to Seek Improvement

In order to prevent accidents and ensure the safety of workers, the Factory Management Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council has successively invited various industries to hold discussions: (1) A meeting was held with straw hat manufacturers, requesting that no paint spraying work be carried out in factories other than those with approved premises. Two larger factories were asked to build proper paint spraying rooms for the industry to use, in order to protect people's lives. (2) As a result of the meeting of factories where accidents occurred due to the use of voltage machines, each factory agreed to adopt accident prevention methods and complete them in the near future. (3) At the meeting of electric bulb factory owners, the section asked each factory to propose general methods that they could afford and easily comply with, and to collectively guarantee that they could be effectively implemented. Each factory has now reported to the section one after another.

### The Chinese YMCA's Military Service

Over the Past Year

Remarkable Achievements

Since its inception, the Chinese YMCA movement has undergone more than fifty years, with the aim of promoting the spirit of Christ, uniting young people with common aspirations, cultivating complete personalities, and building a perfect society. It has long been praised by the people of the country. Since the outbreak of war, it has been deeply concerned about the unprecedented crisis facing the nation and grieved by the tragic sacrifices of the people. Therefore, it has striven to promote the work of the extraordinary period in accordance with its service aspirations. It has made great efforts to carry out military service work, which is considered to be of paramount importance. During the Battle of the Great Wall in 1933 and the Suiyuan War in 1936, it carried out military service work in accordance with this principle, in conjunction with the national YMCA. Since the Lugouqiao Incident revealed the full-scale war, it has been conducting large-scale military service for more than twenty months. The methods of work are divided into (1) consolation and reception, (2) wound dressing and rescue, (3) training and education, and (4) recreation and entertainment. The first type (consolation and reception) includes setting up reception stations at train stations to provide tea, water, porridge, and collecting various kinds of consolation gifts to distribute to the army and wounded soldier hospitals. The second type (wound dressing and rescue) includes setting up temporary dressing stations and sending personnel to be stationed on health trains and health ships to bandage and change medicines for wounded soldiers, and to care for and support seriously wounded soldiers. The third type (training and education) includes organizing military clubs, officer clubs, setting up alarms, holding current affairs lectures, and providing spiritual lectures and physical training for recruits. The fourth type (recreation and entertainment) includes organizing touring service groups, showing movies and educational slides, performing Peking opera and dramas, holding military-civilian parties or wounded soldier parties, and equipping various clubs with various forms of recreation and entertainment for officers and soldiers to freely use during rest. Military service work began in the fall of 1937 and has been going on for more than twenty months. The organizational method is to establish a headquarters in the central location in front, responsible for planning, dispatching, and supervising. Branches are established in various places to carry out the work. In the past, due to the drastic changes in the war situation, branches were moved and dispersed from time to time. At most, there were 20 branches, and the number of staff reached more than 160 people (excluding employees). These staff members do not receive salaries (only personal living expenses are paid), do not hesitate to work hard, and their lives are often in danger under artillery fire and air raids. Their enthusiasm for service has never diminished, which is truly admirable. In terms of the amount of work done, for example, in the reception work, the Zhengzhou branch burned more than 2,000 catties of firewood every day during a certain period. In addition to tea, water, and porridge, 20 pots of porridge were cooked. In the rescue work, the Xinyang branch used more than 2,000 rolls of bandages to change medicines for wounded soldiers in 16 hours on a certain day. In the past, this kind of work was praised by people from all walks of life, who made material donations, so it was possible to achieve such widespread service with a small amount of more than 100,000 yuan. This year, encouraged by the highest authorities, it was decided to expand the scale again, planning to increase the number of service branches from 20 to 40, and increase the number of staff by 250 people. Once the funds are raised, it can be safely implemented according to the plan. Other examples include student relief work, which includes (1) establishing work-study quotas for students affected by the war, and (2) subsidizing students stranded in other places to return to their hometowns or transfer to schools in the interior. This relief work has now been implemented in 13 locations, and the amount of aid disbursed, as of the end of last year, totaled 100,000 yuan in national currency. As for refugee relief work, in Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Peiping, Tianjin, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Changsha, and other cities, great efforts are being made to help refugees, either by assuming responsibility for managing shelters, operating refugee industrial workshops, or presiding over refugee production and education, or even being entrusted by local governments to be responsible for the reception and repatriation of refugees throughout the province. The results of their work are also very remarkable. As for the youth service movement, international friendship work, the development of municipal associations in the rear, youth associations were established in Guiyang and Guilin last year, and the promotion of student affairs, such as the successful holding of student summer camps in six locations when the war was fierce last summer. There are also three newly established university associations. All the plans are commendable.

### White Russian Organizations Sequentially and Voluntarily Liquidate: Refuse to Register with the White Russian Emigrant Committee, Believing That the Committee's Policies and Motives are Ambiguous

Refuse to Register with the White Russian Emigrant Committee: Believing that the Committee's Policies and Motives are Ambiguous

The Continental Daily reports that the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" is using the White Russian Emigrant Committee to force all White Russian organizations to register. The White Russians in this city are increasingly dissatisfied. Recently, the White Russian Business Association has announced its voluntary liquidation. Any White Russian organization that refuses to register with the White Russian Emigrant Committee and report the personal details of its members has no other option but to liquidate. It is impossible to ignore the registration order and continue as usual, as its members will be discriminated against and suffer losses. Although the White Russian Emigrant Committee claims that this move is non-political, the White Russian leaders who oppose registration do not value this statement, and say that they cannot register with an organization whose policies and motives are ambiguous.

### Brothel Pimp Coerces Prostitute to Cohabit: Uses Threatening Words and Robs Her Bracelet; Prostitute Gong Caidi Reports Arrest

Sun Achang from Shaoxing, aged fifty-two, has a history of committing theft, intimidation, fraud, and acid attacks, and has been repeatedly sentenced. He has only recently become somewhat settled, working as a pimp in various brothels. He is currently working as an assistant in a brothel at No. 8 Qunyu Lane, Shantou Road. As a result, he became acquainted with Gong Caidi (25 years old, from Zhenjiang), the owner of the Yunniang Brothel at No. 22 Huile Lane, Fuzhou Road. Now, Gong is planning to close the Yunniang Brothel after the Dragon Boat Festival because of

Slow Business.

On the night of the 1st of the month, around midnight, she suddenly received a call from a regular customer surnamed Yang, instructing her to quickly go to Room 504 of the China-South Hotel on Edward Road. Gong dressed up and went there. However, after entering the room, there was no customer surnamed Yang in the room, only Sun Achang. When Sun saw Gong arrive, he immediately threatened her with dangerous words: "I know that you are going to retire from the brothel after the Dragon Boat Festival, so I called you. You should

Cohabit with Me

Otherwise, you will suffer." Gong thought that Sun's words were unreasonable. Their identities were different, and there was no past relationship. It was strange that he suddenly made such an unreasonable demand, so she sternly refused. Unexpectedly, Sun snatched a gold bracelet worth more than two hundred yuan from Gong's hand, saying that if she did not agree to his request, she should not think about getting the bracelet back. Only then did he let her go. Gong returned, and knowing that these pimps all had potential power, she dared not report to the police. However, at half past midnight the night before last, Sun suddenly

Arrived with a Threatening Presence

At Gong's place, seemingly wanting to do something. Gong was frightened and called the Old Gate Police Station. Inspector Zhang Bingchun was immediately ordered to rush to the scene and arrest Sun, confiscating a fake gold bracelet. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi charged him with robbery, and said that because the case was urgent and there was not enough time for a detailed investigation, and because the defendant may have interfered with freedom, further research was needed, so he requested permission to extend the trial. Under Questioning,

### Due to Suspicion of Extortion: Detectives and Police Arrest and Detain; Temporarily Detained for Investigation and Re-examination

The West Patrol Chief of the French Concession Police learned that two of his subordinates, Chinese Detective Lu Zhenchang (25 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 100 Du Shenfu Road) and Chinese Constable Ye Jiahong (25 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 51 Ruan An Lane, West Gate Road), had engaged in extortion from Zhang Qinghua, who ran an opium den at No. 67 Xin Yong'an Street, at 1:00 p.m. on the 18th of this month. Therefore, Lu Detective and Ye Constable were detained and taken into custody. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated that because the defendants were suspected of extortion, he requested detention and a later date for investigation and trial. Under Questioning, Lu Zhenchang confessed that he used to be a doorman at the French General Association. He had only been a Chinese detective in the police station for 42 days. On that day, he was passing by Xin Yong'an Street when he heard a police siren. He rushed to see what was happening and saw someone beating a constable. I asked them what was going on, but they did not answer and beat me too. They then went to the police station. I reported the case afterwards and did not know about the extortion. Constable Ye confessed that he went to No. 67 Xin Yong'an Street to find a friend, Wang Asan, because Wang had asked me to recommend a stevedore. I went to find Wang, but unexpectedly they said that I stole something. I said that they were breaking the law by smoking opium and called me a thief, so there was an argument but no extortion. After verification by Judge Liao, it was ordered that the defendants be detained for further investigation and re-examination at a later date.

Sun Achang confessed that he had a relationship with the prostitute Gong in April last year. Now, because she wanted to cohabit with him, he refused because Gong was addicted to opium and he could not afford it, and because her father and brothers were unusually fierce. Although he pawned the gold bracelet at Baocheng Silver Shop on French Avenue for 163 yuan, Gong took 73 yuan of it, and the rest was used to pay off her opium debts. However, Gong completely denied Sun's confession, calling it a fabrication and deliberate slander. After verification by Judge Xiao Xie Fen, Sun was ordered to be detained and re-examined at a later date.

### Woman Finds Hand Grenade: Entrusts Someone to Sell It; Intercepted by Detectives on the Way

Zhang Wangshi, a woman from Jiangbei, previously found two hand grenades in the Zhabei area and hid them on a boat. Recently, Zhang Wangshi wanted to sell the hand grenades for 25 yuan each and entrusted Dai Weicai and Dai Keyang to sell them. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, she and the two Dais went ashore with the grenades. Unexpectedly, while walking on Meibage Road, they realized that someone seemed to be following them, so they secretly hid the two grenades in a trash can at Lane 345. Then, they went to a teahouse nearby to drink tea and avoid the followers. Half an hour later, when they went to Lane 345 to retrieve the hand grenades, they found that there was only one left, so they took it out and walked along Parker Road and Qingdao Road. They were apprehended by Detective Ma Zhongrong, Chen Lianjing, and Detective Huang Yulin of the Xinza Police Station and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts of the case and requested a postponement. Judge Xiao ordered them to be detained for re-examination in seven days.

### Robbers Arrested: Both Sides Exchange Multiple Shots; Robbers Eventually Escape

At around 9:00 p.m. last night, several robbers broke into a double-fronted shop at No. 438 West Rubicon Road. One robber, holding a Mauser pistol, wantonly threatened the shop employees and apprentices. One shop assistant had a gold ring and seven yuan in legal tender stolen from his hand. Someone went outside to blow the police whistle. At this time, the Putuo Road Police Station heard the alarm and sent a police car to the scene. The robbers fired their guns to resist arrest. Chinese and foreign detectives also drew their guns and fired back. As a result, no one was injured on either side. The robbers eventually escaped into the darkness without a trace.

### Woman Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium

Xu Huangshi, a woman from Ningbo, 40 years old, resided at No. 13 Yide Lane, Old North Gate.

Xu Huangshi was addicted to gambling. Her husband often scolded her because of the difficult financial situation.

### Due to Unsuccessful Remuneration for Transporting Old Iron Chains: Pours Nitric Acid on Friend; Cao Xue Dian is Greedy and Insatiable; Yang Hong Ai Committed Theft

Yang Hongqing, a man from Jiangbei, lived with his wife, Liu, at No. 82, Lane 460, Da Tong Road. Cao Xueli, a friend of Yang's, had known Yang for many years. Because Cao repeatedly asked Yang for loans, Yang often provided assistance. On the 15th of this month, Cao suddenly went to Yang's place, saying that he had no place to live and asked to stay for a few days. Yang agreed. On the afternoon of the 17th, Cao wanted to borrow money again. Yang, considering him

Greedy and Insatiable,

Rejected him. Unexpectedly, Cao became angry out of embarrassment and had an argument with Yang, leading to a conflict. Cao left in a huff. Two hours later, he returned. Around 2:40 a.m. on the 18th, while Yang and his wife were sound asleep, Cao, harboring evil intentions, secretly took a bottle of prepared nitric acid and poured it on Yang and his wife's heads, faces, chests, and arms. Yang and others woke up in pain from their dreams and

Loudly Called for Help.

Cao abandoned the bottle and fled without a trace. Yang and his wife were taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment, and the Xinzha Police Station was informed, who sent Detective Dong Quan to investigate. Since Cao Xueli had no address and had fled, he was strictly searched for. At 10:43 a.m. on the 19th, Cao suddenly surrendered himself to the General Patrol Station and was transferred to the Xinzha Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts of the case and charged him with injury under Article 278 of the Criminal Law. Yang Hongqing and Yang Liu Min were

Helped into Court

To describe the situation at the time. Under Questioning, the defendant Cao Xueli confessed that after the January 28th Incident, Yang Hongqing held a weapon and robbed a rice store and was arrested and sentenced to seven years in prison. He was sent to prison for execution. After serving three and a half years, he was released on bail. Since the August 13th Incident, Yang had been transporting old iron in Hongkou with my help, but he did not provide the remuneration as promised, so I accumulated hatred and took this action out of anger. Judge Xiao verified the confessions and ordered the defendant to be detained for re-examination and sentencing in seven days.

### Woman Holding Her Son: Accuses Restaurant Owner of Abandonment; Defendant Firmly Denies; Arguments Concluded, Awaiting Judgment

He Ruitang from Ningbo, 41 years old this year, residing at No. 1548 Avenue Joffre and running the Futai Foreign Vegetable, Fruit, and Beef Shop at No. 1749 on the same road, was previously accused by He Lin Alai, the widow of his deceased cousin He Shangwu, residing at No. 68 Tao'erfeisishi Hill, of seduction, cohabitation, abandonment, and neglect in the Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court. As a result of the trial, because the plaintiff did not present substantial evidence, only making

Empty Claims,

He Ruitang was found not guilty. Later, the plaintiff did not file an appeal. Now, Lin Alai claims that He Ruitang seduced her into cohabitation and has conceived and given birth to a son named Xiao Tang, who is one year old this year. Because He Ruitang has always abandoned and neglected them, Lin Alai, as a legal representative, along with her son He Xiao Tang, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Special Second District Court against He Ruitang to confirm the parent-child relationship. The court, based on the lawsuit, opened the Seventh Civil Court yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Li Liang, and

Summoned Both Parties

For trial. The plaintiff, Lin Alai, holding her son, claimed in court that her husband, He Shangwu, was the defendant's cousin and had been dead for five years. Initially, the defendant seduced her when she was lonely and began cohabitation in October 1937, cohabiting in the same place with his wife. Later, because his wife was fierce, the defendant had her move out to another place. However, the defendant often took her to the Ruizhong Hotel at No. 275 Zhejiang Road and the Lianyuan Hotel next to the Grand Theatre for illicit relations, resulting in pregnancy and the birth of Xiao Tang.

When Opening the Hotel,

The defendant used the pseudonym He Asan. This can be investigated. The defendant's lawyer, Li Pengcheng, arrived on his behalf. He denied having any relationship with the plaintiff. He stated that the plaintiff had always worked as a maid outside. After her husband died, she asked the defendant to employ her at home as a maid. Later, because the plaintiff often brought men to the defendant's house, he dismissed her. After verifying the facts in court, the case was deemed clear, the debate was concluded, and the judgment was scheduled for the 24th.

### Police Authorities Strictly Prohibit Extortion of Illegal Fees

With the approach of the Dragon Boat Festival, the French Concession Police Authorities have discovered that some unemployed hooligans are gathering in crowds to extort illegal fees from various shops for their own use, which is abhorrent. Yesterday, all police stations were notified to send competent detectives to various shops and vegetable markets to inform the shop owners and vegetable vendors not to pay a single cent. If hooligans use force to extort, they are authorized to call the police and arrest them. Patrol constables were also instructed to pay attention to the actions of those who resemble hooligans. If they encounter such individuals extorting illegal fees from shops and vegetable vendors, they should be arrested for investigation to ensure business stability.

### Gambling Den Closed

The Da Guang News Agency reports that the "You Cheng Company" on Avenue Joffre and Rue du Consulat in West Shanghai was a large-scale gambling den that used a guessing game similar to "White Pigeon Tickets" called "Character Gall." In fact, it was nothing more than a disguised lottery organization. The "Company" had just opened last month and had falsely used the name "You Cheng Pharmaceutical Company" to publish a large advertisement in the newspaper, falsely claiming to recruit salespersons to lure people into the game. However, after this trick was exposed, few responded, resulting in sluggish "business" and a sparse crowd. However, due to the large number of internal employees and huge expenses, the company suffered losses of up to 250,000 yuan within a month and could not maintain operations, so it closed down a few days ago.

### Streetcar Collides Violently with Rickshaw: Rickshaw Puller Dies Tragically

### Bank Accountant Arrested for Embezzling Large Sums of Money; Converting Exchange Rate Profits into Private Funds; Discovered by Authorities and Detained for Interrogation

Fang Xile, a Cantonese man residing at No. 20 Fude Lane, Hart Road, who enjoyed gambling, was employed as an accountant at the Dong Bank, No. 52 Ningbo Road. However, Fang had a gambling addiction, frequently visiting the Jai Alai and dog racing tracks, leading to mounting debts. Recently, the bank discovered that Fang had been embezzling funds totaling 31,498.73 yuan through fraudulent practices. The embezzlement method involved clients of the Guangdong Bank who had remittances to foreign countries but did not settle accounts at the time. Later, after a considerable period, settlements were made. Due to the recent rise in gold prices, the settlement price often exceeded the remittance price significantly. This settlement profit should have been enjoyed by the Guangdong Bank, but Fang embezzled it all. The bank reported this to the General Inspectorate, and Chief Detective Jiang Shangpei of the Chinese Detective Bureau arrested Fang at his residence yesterday. Fang was brought to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court yesterday. The Detective Bureau's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, prosecuted him for embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Law, stating that the Detective Bureau had not been notified of the method of calculating the embezzled amount. Therefore, a request was made to postpone the trial for one week. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, Fang was ordered to be remanded in custody, and the trial was postponed.

Science and Life

### Neither Up Nor Down

— He Shi

The importance of elevating and promoting science has been discussed before. Now, I will discuss the weaknesses of the current state of science in the country, as a source of mutual encouragement for colleagues. Our country has been paying attention to science for decades. The government and society have often promoted it, but those engaged in science in the country, due to their lack of effort, have caused science to become neither up nor down. (It should be stated here that there are indeed experts in the country who are working hard, and their spirit and achievements are admirable, which cannot be completely dismissed. However, they are few in number and still cannot defeat the majority who are hesitant to move forward). Although the number of specialized personnel is increasing, they use their knowledge to seek special treatment, and their desire to serve the country cannot overcome their selfish thoughts of self-preservation. They believe that the knowledge and training they have received are sufficient to make them proud of the country and more than enough for themselves, and they no longer conduct in-depth research. Moreover, they have no interest in the work of promoting science education and imparting scientific knowledge to the lower levels of society, such as giving public lectures and publishing simple articles that can increase the level of knowledge of the Chinese people and improve their living habits. As a result, common scientific knowledge cannot be popularized among the people, and science in our country is inevitably becoming aristocratic. Even today, it still cannot be transformed from an imported product into a native one, which is regrettable. For this reason, science in our country has failed to flourish and compete with the world's advanced scientific countries. The country's urgent and serious problems, which require scientific and technological solutions, are helpless and have to rely on others. Because the people lack common scientific knowledge, their knowledge and skills are also particularly backward. Suddenly encountering this serious national crisis, they are slaughtered, burned, and looted by others, and suffer all kinds of torments. Alas, whose fault is it! Our country's scientific community is not lacking in patriotic and ambitious people. I hope that everyone will be determined to encourage themselves and work hard to improve and promote scientific work.

### Summer's Greatest Enemy: The Disgusting Bedbug

— Xing Qiu

Introducing several methods to eliminate them

Anyone living in the city knows that the greatest enemy in summer is the bedbug. It sucks human blood, causing the skin to swell, itch, and become painful. Of course, some people are not affected by it. Bedbugs usually lie dormant during the day and come out at night, making it difficult to sleep and even affecting work during the day. The crevices of wooden walls, bedding, and all daily-use furniture are where they live. This parasite, of course, comes from uncleanliness, but we often find traces of this nasty thing on people who wear fine clothes. Bedbugs are small animals that are truly easy to breed and spread widely.

Bedbugs belong to the order Hemiptera and the family Cimicidae. They have many names. The Japanese call them Nanjing bugs, and the English call them bed bugs or wall lice. There are two common types: one is the tropical bedbug (Cimex hemiptera Fabr), which is distributed in the tropics and subtropics, and is very common in the southern provinces of our country; the other is the temperate bedbug (Cimex lectularius L.), which is most common in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins. Adult bedbugs are flat on their backs and bellies, making them suitable for crawling in crevices. They are four to five millimeters long and three millimeters wide, with a brownish-brown color. The whole body is divided into three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. Reproduction is incomplete metamorphosis. The development from egg to nymph to adult is short. If the temperature and food are suitable, it only takes thirty days from egg to adult. Therefore, the climate is warm, and they can almost reproduce all year round, at least five or six generations, but they are relatively inactive in winter. The spread of bedbugs, of course, migrates to other places with the host. If there is no one in the room, they will also eat the blood of other animals. Even if they lack food, it does not have a significant impact. They can often maintain life for more than a year without eating. This fact has been proven by people in China and abroad. According to the report of the American Giranlt in 1905, female insects lay 75 to 200 eggs at a time. If male and female bedbugs are imprisoned in a bottle without food and allowed to mate, their lives can last from 54 to 316 days. This shows that once a family is infested with bedbugs, it is really difficult to get rid of them, and at the same time, where they live is really elusive.

The long-term survival of bedbugs is completely related to temperature, because temperature can limit their activity and make them hibernate or semi-hibernate. They have great resistance to low temperatures. They live quite vigorously above 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and gradually become dormant below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. However, when the temperature reaches 96 degrees Fahrenheit and the temperature is increased at the same time, they die completely. The source of their odor comes from the stink gland in the body, located inside the mesothorax and opening at the base of the hind legs. The secreted odorous liquid is very clear, oily, volatile, and strongly acidic. It is a natural defense method, but it is actually detrimental to it, and people can know and catch it.

I have talked a lot about the ecology and habits of bedbugs. We know that they are easy to breed and difficult to get rid of. The effective method, of course, is to prevent them in advance, pay attention to cleanliness, and do not bring adult bedbugs or eggs into the room from other places. Now that you have them, the following methods of eradication can be used as a reference.

1. Fumigation: The chemicals used are sodium cyanide (one pound), sulfuric acid (one and a half pounds), and water (three pounds) (assuming the house is 1,000 cubic feet). The procedure is to first close the doors and windows tightly, put the water in a ceramic basin, and slowly pour in sulfuric acid, stirring with a stick. Then gently put in sodium cyanide (wrapped in paper). Workers should quickly go out and then close the doors and windows tightly, letting it fumigate. After 12 hours, the bedbugs can be killed. This method is the most effective, but attention must be paid to the implementation of this toxic gas. First, all the gaps in the room must be plugged to prevent the toxic gas from entering other rooms.

Another method is to put calcium cyanide on the floor of the room, choosing a day with a higher temperature to do it. Use four ounces of medicine for every 100 cubic feet of sealed room, and seal the room for 20 hours. Sulfur can also be used, four pounds per thousand cubic feet. When fumigating, put the sulfur in an iron pan, add a little alcohol, and then put it in a large basin of water to prevent fire. The fumigation time is 18 hours to one day and night.

2. Filling: Fill the gaps in the room with various materials to prevent the bedbugs' living places from having constant air circulation. Tung oil and lime soft blocks can be used on wooden boards, and lime can be used to paint brick walls.

3. Pouring: Bedbugs often live in the gaps in bed frames, so this method is very economical, but it cannot completely eradicate them. There are several common medicines: A. Put kerosene and pyrethrum powder in a bottle, one catty of oil and three or four taels of powder, and soak it tightly for four or five days. Then use it to spray the gaps, which is very effective. B. Pouring kerosene or turpentine into the gaps in the shop table can also kill some of them. C. Killing with boiling water is also slightly effective. D. Mix mercury chloride (one ounce), alcohol (one pint), and turpentine (one pint), and use crow feathers to drip it into the bed gaps, which is very effective.

4. Cleanliness and Heat: Pay attention to cleanliness and be diligent in catching them to reduce their reproduction. When the temperature is extremely high in summer, burn charcoal in the room, close the doors and windows tightly to make the temperature very high, which can often suffocate the bedbugs. Some people have even tried mixing rhubarb, rock sugar, and lye with boiling water, pouring it into the gaps of utensils repeatedly, and the bedbugs will disappear.

The methods to eradicate bedbugs are probably no more than the above. The first fumigation method is of course the most suitable for public places such as schools and hotels. It may not be easy for ordinary families to implement it in this way, so they can only choose a convenient method to implement it. In short, "cleanliness" and "diligent catching" are the only wonderful methods, and you must not let them reproduce naturally without killing them. Although it is not certain that biting by bedbugs will cause great danger, it is said that a skin disease called oriental sore and black fever (Kala-azar) are transmitted by these disgusting bedbugs.

Now is the period of great activity of bedbugs. I wonder how many citizens suffer from them at night, directly suffering physically and indirectly affecting their mental work. We should all rise up and carry out a bedbug eradication campaign together.

### Animals and Space

— Ji Qian

Animals have a great reproductive capacity. Scholars have determined that there are more than 90,000 known species of animals in the world. It is impossible to calculate how many individuals there are in each species. It is even more unknown how many species have not been determined. Take just one class of insects, their number is so great that experts say it can be compared to the number of stars in the sky. Animals live in all places on earth where they can grow. Plains and broad swamps are easier to breed; animals can be found on high mountains of 10,000 feet, with snow and ice; there are also animals in the seabed six miles deep; there are animals in the Arctic and Antarctic oceans; there are also animals in very hot springs, in salt lakes, and in very dry deserts. The reason for this is that they reproduce very quickly. The slowest animal to reproduce is the elephant. The life span of an elephant is 100 years. Its breeding starts at 30 years old and ends at 90 years old. On average, it only gives birth to one offspring every ten years, and only six elephants in its lifetime. Other birds, such as the golden eagle, also reproduce slowly, but not as slow as elephants. There are other animals that reproduce slowly, but compared to elephants and golden eagles, they are still faster. This is a minority phenomenon. As a general rule, the speed of animal reproduction is increasing rapidly. Looking at flies, each female fly can lay more than 120 eggs at a time, and each fly lays eggs 12-13 times. The total number is known. Ordinary fish can lay thousands of eggs, and frogs also lay a large number of eggs. At the turn of spring and summer, there are clusters of frog eggs in ponds, each cluster containing hundreds of eggs. Frogs lay eggs many times during the spawning season. The number produced in one period is unknown, but it is likely to be tens of thousands. A certain species of starfish can produce at least 20 million eggs in each breeding season. The smallest trichomonads can multiply to millions in one week. A pair of midges can produce 60 million million offspring in one summer. In short, the speed of animal reproduction is beyond our dreams. As mentioned earlier, elephants reproduce extremely slowly. Darwin once said that if all the offspring of a pair of elephants could survive and develop, they could have 19 million descendants after more than 700 years. If they were passed on for thousands of years, they could fill all the gaps on the earth! The American Mr. Wu Teluff observed the asexual reproduction of paramecia. Starting with more than 3,000 paramecia, they increased threefold after 48 hours. He said that if they could all survive, the volume of the offspring produced by reproduction after five years could be 10,000 times that of the earth. The Englishman Malthus said that the increase of organisms follows a geometric progression, and the food on earth is not enough to supply them. In addition, the gaps on the ground are limited, and the environment is constantly changing. Darwin and Wallace said that this is the phenomenon of competition for survival, is it not true!

### Hair Growth and Seasons

— Gu Buwen

Hair Grows More Easily in Hot Weather

Hair growth varies from season to season. The length of growth is related to temperature. According to scholars' observations, there is now a practical measurement method. The subject of the experiment was a 59-year-old male. Throughout the year, the same location on the face was designated, and hair was shaved daily at the same time. This designated location was an area of one square inch near the front of the ear, and a Ocular Micrometer was used for measurement. The average daily temperature (based on the astronomical observatory's report) was also recorded, and the records were continuously kept without omission. The results of the experiment were as follows:

Month Average Temperature Hair Growth Length

January 58 degrees ·305 hao

February 54 degrees ·386 hao

March 61 degrees ·404 hao

April 70 degrees ·458 hao

May 74 degrees ·464 hao

June 81 degrees ·516 hao

July 83 degrees ·533 hao

August 82 degrees ·538 hao

September 79 degrees ·545 hao

October 73 degrees ·533 hao

November 64 degrees ·495 hao

December 60 degrees ·375 hao

"Hao" = one thousandth of a meter

### After Reading "The Patriot"

— Lin Ying

I don't particularly like writing book reviews, but after I finished reading "The Patriot," a compilation of translations by Shanghai translators, I couldn't help but express my feelings. Indeed, it moved me to the point of anger.

Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth" caused a sensation in the American publishing world five or six years ago, and the author made a fortune. It sparked a heated discussion in Chinese literary circles, and the final conclusion was that it sufficiently depicted the life of Chinese farmers, but lacked understanding of the Chinese countryside. Of course, that's in the past. Now, this "The Patriot" portrays Chinese intellectuals, and her understanding is not just lacking, it's simply "nonsense"! Her descriptions and structure are even more scattered and disorganized!

Now, let me first narrate the main points of the story.

I-fan, a student at a missionary school and the son of a banker, joins the 1927 revolution "inexplicably" after meeting his classmate En-lai. Because of Chiang Kai-shek's purge in Shanghai, he is sent by his father to work at Mr. Muraki's trading company in Japan, where he falls in love with and pursues Muraki's daughter, eventually marrying her. A little over a month after the "July 7th Incident" occurs, he returns to Shanghai amidst the flames of war. Upon arriving in China, he smoothly participates in the war and, like a miracle, immediately receives "important appointments" from Chairman Chiang, traveling as a special envoy to the Northwest by plane, where he meets En-lai and travels back and forth between the North and South. He is written as a low-IQ and thoughtless fellow.

The setting of this story is quite "grand," encompassing major events in China over the last ten years. From the Northern Expedition of 1927, through the "September 18th Incident," "July 7th Incident," "August 13th Incident," and to the united front against the Japanese invasion. On the Japanese side, she describes the thoughts and lives of Japanese youth, women, families, and warlords.

But since the author had such grand ambitions to narrate this great story, she should have had a sufficient understanding of the above events, and at the very least, she shouldn't have spread rumors and misunderstandings. She also should have grasped the core of her depiction. However, the author neither understood the Chinese revolution nor did she focus on key issues, lightly brushing over the major events in a few words, without mentioning the significance and circumstances of these events. Instead, she drew out the romance of I-fan pursuing Mr. Muraki's daughter—Wangzi—in Japan, windingly stretching it to occupy the majority of the entire book. Although the remaining small portion describes the Northern Expedition and other events, her descriptions are full of ignorance, rumors, and, strictly speaking, are simply an insult to China.

Here, let me extract a few passages below to see what kind of "patriot" Ms. Pearl Buck portrays. At the same time, I must state that this is not taking things out of context, because these are all the author's own words, and I am only transcribing them truthfully.

"Three hundred Japanese—men, women, and children—were killed by Chinese soldiers in a small town near Beiping... Revenge, Japanese soldiers should retaliate wildly against the peaceful city of Beiping!" The author presents the Tongzhou Incident in this way, omitting the fundamental reasons that triggered the event.

"Chinese people help the Japanese; Chinese planes bomb Shanghai!" Joke, a Chinese pilot mistook a Japanese target and mistakenly dropped his bombs on a busy street, killing hundreds of people." The author does not describe the world-shaking large-scale bloody battle, but instead picks this unfortunate event and satirizes it.

This is the author's description of the Chinese air force:

"Actually, I-fan," I-ke said to her younger brother: "Japan is attacking us in every aspect. In the air force... It's a joke that a woman leads the air force. Which country uses a woman to lead the air force?..." The author seems to be blind, as she seems to know nothing about the Chinese flying generals using their own flesh and blood and bombs to sink enemy warships. Although she cleverly uses the mouths of the Chinese themselves to say bad things about China, we must understand who is holding the pen.

This is how she writes about the Chinese army:

"I don't see that he (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) has any plans. When I left Germany, I thought that after returning to China, I would naturally join the organized national army. What did I find? A large group of untrained soldiers, each group only obeying their small leaders, with no national concept at all..."

Even more shameless is her fabrication of how the Eighth Route Army treats prisoners. Everyone knows that they treat prisoners quite well. But she writes:

"...The soldiers under En-lai's command have a habit of killing all prisoners... Their way of having fun is to lock them in cages or tie them to branches... and stab them with bundles of dry grass or burn them with fire..."

Okay, I don't want to extract any more passages, because this kind of distortion of facts, containing malice (this is what I think), can be readily extracted from the entire book.

In short, this is a book containing poison, and all righteous cultural people should expose it.

Finally, I feel deeply surprised that such a book actually has three translated versions being published on the same day, competing with each other, and mobilizing a large number of cultural figures to translate rumors and promote it. I think this is because half are superstitious about the author's name, and half are driven by the "business sense" of the publishers. After it is published, everyone feels regret.

I hope that in the future, translations should be carefully reviewed in advance, otherwise, it will be like the World event satirized by the author, where we use bombs to bomb ourselves.

### Ancient City

— Li Qiao

A Memoir of the Breakout from Xuzhou

It was said that the ancient city was only twenty *li* away, but we didn't arrive at this ancient place of lodging, enveloped in twilight, until dusk.

Dragging my aching feet, I stepped into the ancient city, which was shrouded in the twilight and surrounded by green trees, seeming so quiet and secluded. Suddenly, a wisp of leisurely thought floated into my mind: Is this the ancient city that Zhang Yide defended? I remember the picture in *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* when I was a child, when Guan Yu beheaded Cai Yang, Zhang Yide was squatting on the tower of the ancient city, beating the drums to cheer him on. Could it be that the tall General Zhang could also squat on the low, fenced gatehouse that I just crossed? —Maybe this city gate is not the original city gate, but is this city really the ancient city that Zhang Yide defended? Please, archaeologists, examine it!

This city is just a market town with two or three hundred households, under the jurisdiction of Haozhou. It seems to be quite lively on ordinary days, but now it has been visited by brutal airplanes several times, and the people have been bombed away. The city is full of frightening desolation. The houses on both sides of the street are completely closed. Even the dogs don't know where they have fled with their owners, and there isn't even a welcoming bark. In the thin darkness of the night, only a few bats spread their black wings, flying quickly back and forth, as if they were playing games in place of the children.

We found a spacious empty house and lay down without any cover.

"Order!" Someone knocked on the door outside.

The door opened, and a messenger walked in:

"The division commander's order: Comrade Yang is to quickly go to Haozhou to scout. Has our dispersed team from the road reached Haozhou? Quickly make contact with them..."

The messenger walked out, and Comrade Yang, who was sleeping on the bed, jumped out of bed, scratching his head:

"How can I go in this dark night? And I've never been to Haozhou..."

At that time, Haozhou was in the midst of fighting, but could he not go?

After hesitating for a while, Comrade Yang changed into civilian clothes and set out with a guide.

Not long after the people in the house went back to sleep, another order was delivered:

——Depart at four o'clock tonight, destination Qiuchu Settlement...

Before dawn, the mixed crowd of people and horses came out of each room, the sound of horses' hooves, the clinking of water bottles and bayonets, the heavy footsteps... mixed together, resounding in the sleeping ancient city. The stiff, dead ancient city seemed to come back to life!

### Also "Safety First"

### (6) A Life Entrusted

— Sang

Once, there was a famous violinist who wanted to auction off his valuable violin, opening the price at five hundred yuan, but no one inquired. So he lowered the price to three hundred yuan, two hundred yuan, fifty yuan, and even ten yuan, but still couldn't sell it. At that moment, the violinist ran to the stage and used that seemingly worthless violin to perform a famous piece. The audience listened quietly to the music, as if they had never heard it before. The sound of the violin was gentle and moving, as if lamenting that there were no kindred spirits in the vast crowd. At the end of the piece, the performer returned the violin to the auctioneer and returned to his seat. Soon after, in the tense atmosphere, a commotion arose in the crowd. It turned out that someone was now willing to pay a thousand yuan to buy the violin. But wasn't this violin the same one that was offered at ten yuan without anyone inquiring? Why did the value of the violin later reach a thousand yuan? Simply because the violin was in the hands of the violinist, it revealed the nobility of its quality! Recently, many people, because of being immersed in sin, have fallen into disrepair, are despised by the public, and are deemed unusable. But because they pulled back from the edge of the cliff and submitted to Jesus, entrusting their bodies to God, they have now completely changed their past errant lives! To be honest, among Christians around the world, there are countless examples like the ones mentioned above. All those who wish to sever old habits and seek the realization of new life, please pay attention! —Shanghai Christian Literature Society Mailing Box 1227.

### Travel Impressions (Continued)

— Li Jinming

The ushering monk led us through the Buddhist hall, heading west, through a door, directly to a guest hall that was still neatly furnished. Inside the hall, there were eight armchairs, a clean red-lacquered table, vases, incense burners, rattan beds, bamboo backrests, gilded couplets... Four guests had arrived before us, as if preparing to stay for a long time.

Hearing that guests who didn't ride sedan chairs also wanted a good room, a plump monk in his forties came out, seeming somewhat displeased. Without speaking, he led us to two rooms behind the guest hall. I said, "It's too dark and not well-ventilated here," so he led us to two rooms facing the front with windows facing outward. This monk had thick, erect eyebrows, greedy eyes, and his face almost carried a fierce look. When he unintentionally heard Da Peng say, "Oh, there's also a signature from He × here. He × is someone I know," (because He × is an important person in this place), his face immediately displayed a smile. He bent his back, stretched out his hands, and made a "please sit, please sit" gesture. (It turned out that He × was a devout Buddhist.)

Before long, tea and refreshments were placed in the guest hall. This fierce-faced monk, who called himself Zen Master Yuan Geng, hurriedly came to invite us to take our seats. The tea and water were undoubtedly of high quality, and the refreshments were enough to make a native of Hunan who had been traveling abroad for many years recall the flavors of his hometown. Foods such as mint cakes, pomelo peel candy, cloud roll pastries, and *Liriope spicata* roots had once made wandering people drool even in their dreams. Now, back in Hunan, these things aren't worth much, but instead of eating enough of them in the city, we have to climb this isolated mountain temple to taste one or two slices, pretending to be guests. Perhaps this is a shortcoming of being human. The monk, seeing my appearance, was somewhat contemptuous.

In this big mountain, aside from coarse red rice, sweet potatoes, green vegetables, bamboo shoots, spring water, and air, everything is valuable. It's not easy to transport goods up here. The fact that they brought something out to treat guests shows that they regard the guests as sacred, because the life of the Bodhisattva also depends on the expenses of the guests. But the old monk has a lot of fields. It is said that the land within six or seventy *li* around Mount Heng belongs to the temple. Because there are so many fields, and enough monks to raise, they show their status and make the wealthy travelers feel insignificant. As the saying goes, with sufficient food and clothing, one knows honor and shame. It's unavoidable that the monks of Shangfeng Temple have some snobbishness.

After the tea was cleared away, we went to the room. The fierce-faced monk followed us, holding a "title inscription booklet" in his hand, begging us to leave some verses on it. He proudly took out a small cloth bag from his pocket, and took out a round, clean, peach-red stone from the cloth bag, pointing and saying:

"You understand physics, take a look at whether this thing is worth a piece of real Hetian jade? Above—this is a dragon, this is a tiger, the dragon coils, and the tiger crouches, as if it were man-made. Is this worth a piece of Hetian jade?"

### Afterthoughts

— Editor

I finally finished reading Pearl S. Buck's "The Patriot," which caused quite a stir. However, the impression we got is almost the same as that of Mr. Lin Ying. We only felt that it was worthless in terms of content and technique, but just selling some Eastern people's superficial knowledge to Westerners like a headhunter! As for the places where she deliberately slandered us, no matter what her, Pearl S. Buck's, motives were, I think they are always unforgivable, because this was unnecessary and could have been avoided.

### The Sinner's Road

— Yan Qi

When this lamp goes out, there is another lamp,

If this road doesn't work, then stop.

I don't believe there's anyone in the world who doesn't drink sweet wine,

A broken cart, a broken spear, a broken bow, are also the sound of horns.

Yesterday, today, tomorrow, sunrise to sunset,

Blue arrow pointing the way, back on a new path.

The past fate is forever a confession,

Odes, blessings, holy flowers, a few points on the city tower.

Spring and Autumn

### The Life of Electric Bulb Workers

— Yan

Thanks to the introduction of a friend, I had the opportunity to visit the actual working conditions of an electric bulb factory and interview the male and female workers there in detail about their lives. Below is a description of the living conditions of the workers in various departments that I learned from my interviews there:

"S"-Pickers

The filament in the small light bulb, the shape of its setup, is like the letter "S", so picking filaments is generally referred to by electric bulb workers as "picking S". This work is done by female workers, and their ages are all around fifteen to twenty-five, because only such young women have the patience and can be meticulous and attentive to do this job well. This is an extremely long and extremely fine steel wire. After being tempered and sheared by engineers using scientific methods, this filament, which is suitable for assembling on electric bulbs, must be sorted and selected. They need to have sharp eyesight, otherwise this tiny "S" is almost impossible to see. Therefore, this work is extremely taxing on eyesight and brainpower. All day long, crouching at the desk often makes them dizzy, lightheaded, and backache! Although their wages are slightly higher than those of ordinary female workers, they can only earn five or six *jiao* to seven or eight *jiao* a day.

"S"-Makers

This involves gluing two filaments together with molten glass tubes, and it is the work of male workers. They sit next to intense gas furnaces all day long, working constantly. Whether it is winter or summer, they are always covered in sweat, and their clothes are soaked! Their suffocation and discomfort are no different from those of blacksmiths next to a large furnace. They are among the more arduous types of workers in all departments. However, their wages are extremely limited, with the higher ones only earning about the same as the "S"-picking ladies.

Bulb-Blowers

This department is staffed by male and female child laborers. Their ages are mostly around ten to fourteen years old. Their work is even more painful than that of the "S"-making workers! Because they work next to intense gas furnaces all day long, and they have to hold extremely hot glass tubes in their mouths, sucking and blowing at the flames. Blowing and sucking until the molten glass forms the shape of a bulb. Because they are still in the learning stage, their wages are even more meager, only one to three yuan per month.

Air Extractors

This is a department staffed by important workers. They must have scientific and chemical knowledge. That is, after the glass bulb is blown, its air must be extracted using chemicals and scientific methods before the copper head and filament can be assembled. Their wages are generally higher than those of ordinary male and female workers, generally from forty to seventy or eighty yuan per month.

Plaster Gluers

The copper head must be glued to the top of the bulb with plaster. This is also a department for female workers, both old and young. Their wages are calculated based on a contract system, at two to three *jiao* per thousand. Therefore, although their work is relatively easy, their income can still reach from ten to twenty yuan per month.

Solderers

To firmly connect the "S" and the copper head, in addition to the adhesion of the plaster, it is also necessary to soak the top with tin. Because this is a relatively easy part, it is only done by male child laborers who are slightly older. But their hardship is not much different from that of "S"-makers and bulb-blowers. Their wages are four to six or seven yuan per month.

Bulb-Pickers

This is the easiest part of all departments, requiring only the selection of bulbs with damage marks. This is done by the female workers and child laborers who first entered the factory, and the wages are only one to three yuan. In addition, there are also contract systems (limited to female workers), or temporary employees, who earn three *fen* per thousand bulbs picked, earning three to five *jiao* a day.

Chapter 12: The Beauty's Revenge Can't Erase Sinister Karma, Loving Words at the Green Window Renew a Fated Match

The house had an upper floor, and the old servant went upstairs to report to his master. Pan Peiying listened carefully, hearing the voices of women and children, but she couldn't make out what they were saying. In less than five minutes, she heard the sound of the staircase creaking. Zhao Letian, leaning on two crutches, walked in. When Pan Peiying saw him, she couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness, and tears welled up in her eyes, thinking: How could such a good person only have one leg? But Zhao Letian had a face full of joy, his face covered in smiles, as if he was very welcoming to her, saying: "It's rare! It's rare! Ms. Pan! How could you think of an old friend and come to see me?" Pan Peiying, with a slightly choked voice, said: "I... I... I only found out about your whereabouts yesterday, and only then did I know that you were not dead." Zhao Letian said: "Who told you I was dead? At first, I thought I was dead, but I didn't expect to only lose a leg." Pan Peiying said: "At first, the newspapers all reported that you had died in this nocturnal attack, and they all said that you had sacrificed yourself for the country. Until yesterday, I thought that I would never see you again." Zhao Letian was still very attentive, very happy, and invited Pan Peiying to sit down, and sat across from her himself, asking: "Then who told you that I was not dead?" He smiled and said, "So what if we meet again?" Pan Peiying said: "Until yesterday, I was playing in Huishan, and I met Yuan Shuwen, and only then did I know that you were still alive. The reason why I wanted to see you was because I wanted to express my heart to you once. When you wrote a letter asking me to persuade my father not to fall into their pack of foxes and dogs. Who knew that this letter would fall into my father's hands. At that time, he forced me to write this letter rejecting you, but he put forward two conditions. One was to break off contact with you, and the other was to secretly send the military police to arrest you. They knew your address, and it was easy to arrest you. At that time, I felt that you were in great danger, so I would rather agree to the first condition and break off contact with you. Because we knew each other's hearts, I changed our usual terms of address in this letter. I thought that you might know that I was being coerced. I thought that even if you couldn't guess it at the time, I could write to you and deny that the previous letter was not my original intention. Who knew that they were monitoring me very strictly, and I couldn't move at all. But I thought that we were both young, and there would always be a day when we would meet, and this situation would not last long after all. I didn't expect a bolt from the blue, and you sacrificed yourself for the country. This made it impossible for me to express my heart, which was so cruel!" (142)

### A Visit to a Soap Making Demonstration

— (Zhang Zhenshan)

It is undeniable that the efficiency of industrial production in Shanghai's Chinese industrial circles is inferior to that of foreign merchants in Shanghai. In recent years, there has been a phenomenon of rapid catching up, but there is still a distance to catch up, not to mention competition, and it is still difficult to control one's own market. The reasons for this are naturally not just one, but the main one is that production education has not been popularized, and there is a lack of general talent. Therefore, irrigating knowledge of industrial production is indeed necessary, especially in the urban areas of Shanghai, where there are plenty of unemployed people.

The Yong'an Company is now using a special location in its store to demonstrate soap making. Although the motive is to promote business and increase the sales of its products, this motive is still very good. It can invisibly benefit those who want to engage in industrial production, and at the same time, it can point out a way for the unemployed to make a living. Therefore, after visiting, I wrote this record.

A small machine is divided into five groups, which are managed by two young female employees respectively. When the horn announces the start of the demonstration, the initial action is to pour crushed soap pieces into the first group of mixers, and then add a little essence, and then start the motor. There is an axis inside this mixer, and the axis is equipped with curved leaves. The unfinished soap material is stirred inside due to the repeated rotation of the leaves. After stirring evenly, it is transferred to the second group of grinders. Start the motor to make the machine wheels rotate continuously, and the dry crushed soap flakes inside will gradually condense into a noodle shape. After multiple grinding, it is replaced with a spiral extrusion machine. After the soap material is poured in from the inlet, it is extruded from the outlet through the pressure of the machine in the form of strips. Long strips are then cut into small pieces by a cutting machine, and each one is placed on a printing machine, printed into a suitable shape and pattern, and then wrapped in paper. The entire project is completed.

However, this soap-making process is only a specific and miniature image. If it is manufactured and sold, its quality and manufacturing techniques must be appropriately expanded. Moreover, this miniature performance does not show the mixing of raw materials. Therefore, I will write down the names and dosages of the raw materials I know below:

To make ordinary soap, you only need to use 100 parts of fat (Eatty) (beef fat, lard, mutton, bird, vegetable oil can be used); Caustic soda (Sodiun Caustie); 20 parts; 150 parts of water; and a little resin (Resins); Rosin; Coconut oil (Cocoa Nat Oil); The configuration of these raw materials must be appropriately adjusted according to the required amount. If the soap needs to be easily hardened, add a few parts of sodium carbonate crystal (Sodiumnate Crystal).

In addition, there are many types and colors of soap, for example: ordinary soap, scented soap, fatty soap, resin soap, medicated soap, transparent soap, bleaching soap, red, brown, yellow, green, white, etc. The production of these types and the appropriate blending of colors must have sufficient experience to be able to handle with ease, such as: how many raw materials and silver beads should be added to red soap to show the desired color.

In Shanghai, it is really unknown how many unemployed people there are. Friends who wander around all day and are at a loss, may wish to try it out, because soap is one of the most important daily necessities, and its sales volume is difficult to describe. If you use a little capital to make and sell it yourself in your home, you may be able to make a living. However, if you are engaged in it with a small amount of capital, it is best to specialize in ordinary soap, because ordinary soap is easier to make, and there are more targets for peddling, so sales will naturally develop easily. Now that the company is publicly performing, it is a learning opportunity that does not cost a penny.

### Two Films Worthy of Attention

— Lone Star

"The Hopes of Britannia" from Britain

British Progressive Films, in collaboration with several other companies, has recently completed a film called "The Hopes of Britannia." The film depicts the Chamberlain government's cold indifference to the suffering endured by British merchant ships and sailors at the hands of Franco during the Spanish Civil War.

This film fully exposes the damage suffered by the British Empire in the Spanish Civil War. Through scenes of aerial bombardment and various charts, it illustrates that British trade routes are all within the radius of the German and Italian airfields on the Spanish coast, and that the power over their life and death has long since shifted from the hands of the British to those of the Germans and Italians.

It also explains that the Strait of Gibraltar has been surrounded by long-range Nazi artillery, and that planes flying from German and Italian airfields in Spain or Africa constantly threaten to cut off all British foreign trade routes.

The film was banned by the British film censorship authorities during its review, and has sparked protests and criticisms from the film and public opinion circles. However, despite the protests and criticisms, the ban remains in place!

The Soviet Union's "If War Comes"

The production of the new Soviet film "If War Comes" is a comprehensive response from the Soviet authorities to those who generally belittle Soviet strength. This is because rumors have been intentionally spread internationally that the Soviet Union's national power is insufficient and that the Soviet Union's position will not be important in a decisive war. Now, the public release of "If War Comes" is presenting a powerful rebuttal to those who spread and believe these rumors.

The film depicts the Soviet Union suddenly attacked by a certain powerful country in Western Europe, thus leading to war. However, the war ends very quickly. By the end of the film, the enemy's capital has been occupied by the Soviet Red Army, and countless enemy officers have been taken prisoner. The film depicts this war as being extremely easy to win. Cavalry charging with bayonets, high-speed tanks, incredibly powerful heavy bombers, and long-range Soviet artillery, with a leisurely and effortless air, shatter the enemy's dreams of invasion. Some of the war scenes are taken from training newsreels. The greatest scene is of a large number of Red Army soldiers jumping from airplanes with parachutes, appearing behind enemy lines and posing a very significant threat to the enemy.

"If War Comes" is a standard military propaganda film, but it only says two things: To the Soviet people, it says: "Rest assured!" To other countries, it says: "If you come to attack, we will respond immediately, and the battlefield will be on your territory!"

Merle Oberon is having a great time in "Wuthering Heights." Look how beautiful her expression is!

### Recent Developments in Various Peking Opera Troupes in Beiping

— Yan Yan

Beiping is the birthplace of Peking Opera, with numerous opera schools established. They are all working hard to cultivate future talent for the sake of Peking Opera's future. For example, Mao Shilai, Li Shifang, and Sha Shixin from the Dangliancheng troupe, and Song Dezhu, Wang Jinlu, and Fu Dewei from the Opera School, are all outstanding talents who have graduated recently. The recent developments in various opera schools are reported separately below:

Fu Liancheng Society

The Fu Liancheng Society is currently the oldest opera school in Beiping. Its students, who graduated from the Xi, Lian, Fu, and Sheng classes, have performed in various places and have received extremely high praise. Most of the students from the "Shi" class have also graduated. Recently, the students in the society have been named with the character "Yuan." After "Yuan," the four characters "Yun Qing Fu Lai" have been decided. The top students in the Yuan class include Liu Yuantong and Huang Yuanqing, but there are very few of them. During this period of transition, its performances in various theaters are entirely based on the new plays of the famous comic actor Ye Shengzhang to attract audiences. For example, plays such as "The Drunken Beggar" and "Juan Juan" are all personal masterpieces of Shengzhang. Recently, a new play "Ouyang De" has been staged, and the first part has already been performed and has been extremely well-received. They are now working on the second part, which is scheduled to be performed this month.

Opera School

The students of the Beiping Opera School are divided into eight classes. Currently, only the first four classes are graduating, arranged in the order of the four characters "De He Jin Yu." Female students are identified by a grass radical on the third character. The school was established in 1930 and has a short history, but it cannot be said that it has trained few talents. Those who have already graduated, such as Song Dezhu, Chuan Dewei, and Zhao Jinrong, all have very good reputations. Recently, another group of students will graduate on August 1, including Wang Jinlu, Wang Helin, and Li Hezeng. Currently, there are rising talents in the school, such as Qingyi actress Li Yuru, civil and military Laosheng actor Zhang Yuchan, long-bearded Wusheng actor Hu Jintao, and Wudan actress Li Jinhong. There is no immediate cause for concern about a shortage of talent. Performances in various theaters are also promoted using new plays, such as "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" written by Weng Ouhong, which is the most prominent example. Other plays that have already been performed include "Three Women's Jealousy," and those that are being rehearsed and are about to be performed include "Marriage Tragedy" and "Loyal and Righteous Heroes."

Rong Chun Society

The Rong Chun Society is organized by the famous Dan actress Shang Xiaoyun. The president is Zhao Yankui. Currently, there are more than 300 students, among whom Shang Changchun's Wusheng and Xu Rongkui's Xusheng have achieved more success. Although the society was established not long ago, it has a certain audience because of its hard work. However, it relies entirely on new plays to attract audiences. The number of new plays it has performed is no less than several dozen. Currently, it is rushing to rehearse the play "Romance of the Barbarian King," which is a variation of the story of Zhuge Liang Capturing Meng Huo Seven Times. The roles have been assigned, with Shang Changchun playing Meng Huo, Xu Rongkui playing Zhuge Liang, and Tian Rongfen playing Lady Zhurong. It is scheduled to be performed this month. Following that is a seasonal play called "The Eight Mixed Yuan Boxes." All the stage routines are based on Shang Xiaoyun's own blueprint, and it is prepared to be performed during the Dragon Boat Festival to add to the festive atmosphere.

The Fall of Woh Yun Chu Shih and the Rise of Li Duokui

After the death of the old master Gong Yunfu, everyone knew that Li Duokui could inherit his mantle. In fact, in terms of qualifications, singing, acting, and reciting, the most qualified successor of the Gong style should be Woh Yun Chu Shih, followed by Duokui. Woh Yun is also of Banner origin, originally named Yu Jing. After the Republic of China, he changed his surname to Zhao. He is now nearly fifty years old. He attended the Noble School during the late Qing Dynasty. From a young age, he was addicted to opera and loved to study Gong Yunfu's style. Therefore, he deeply understood Gong Yunfu's actions, expressions, singing, and reciting. Others who learn from Gong Yunfu only roughly imitate his appearance, but Woh Yun can imitate his sitting, walking, gaze, a raising of his hand, and a flick of his sleeve completely accurately. He often said: Gong Yunfu mostly sits with his body turned to the side. This is like taking a photograph. If you sit upright with your back straight, the photo will not look good; it will also look too unnatural. Gong Yunfu not only slightly turns his body, but also places one foot on the crossbar under the chair and hooks the other behind the first. Those watching from the audience can only see the tip of one foot, slightly revealing the yellow cloud-patterned shoe and snow-white cloth sock. This is much better than letting people see the old lady's two big feet. This is a very small detail, but Chu Shih can imitate it vividly, which shows that he really put in a lot of effort to study Gong Yunfu's style privately. He often performed "Hanging," "Six Halls," "Scolding Cao," and "Visiting Mother" in various private performances, which was highly praised by the audience. Therefore, he worked even harder to study Gong Yunfu's plays. As a result, he was already very famous in the early years of the Republic of China. After the revolution, most Banner people suffered from economic pressure. Since he had a skill, he became a student of Gong Yunfu and officially became an actor. —(42)—

### Celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with Stage Performances of "Legend of the White Snake"

— Haisheng

Today is the Dragon Boat Festival. As in the past, various theaters are staging "Legend of the White Snake." Although the lunar calendar has been abolished for a long time, people still cannot avoid following customs, and it is laughable to say that it is to celebrate the holiday. The arrangements for this play at various theaters in Shanghai are recorded below.

Great Stage

The play was rehearsed last night. In addition to Chen Xiaomu, Li Ruilai, and Li Junyu, who are playing Xu Xian, the Monkey King Zhang Yipeng also joined in cross-dressing. Bai Niangniang is played by Wang Yaoqin, Yu Xiuxia, and Little White Peony. Little Qing is specially played by the rising beautiful Kun Dan Fu Juying. This actress is excellent in both beauty and art, and is highly valued by the management. Therefore, she has been practicing martial arts diligently recently, so that she can show off her skills in "Legend of the White Snake." If the performance is successful, it is hoped that she will stand out.

Co-Stage

This theater is famous for this play. It is currently being staged by Zhou Fengwen, Ge Huaqing, and Lu Wenyi. The roles have been assigned early: Wang Chunbai, Jiang Xiaolou, Pan Dingxin, and Little Zhao Junyu play Xu Xian; Mao Jianqiu, Li Xuefang, Pink Peony, and Zhao Junyan play Bai Niangniang; Yu Mudan, White Peony, Shen Yanqin, and Xiao Linghong play Little Qing. Chen Yuelou, the backstage manager of the theater, who has not performed for many years, has also joined in as Chen Biao, and will perform with a real python when subduing Bai Niangniang, which is thrilling and eye-catching.

Tianchan Stage

When the second part of "Seven Swords and Thirteen Heroes" was being rehearsed the night before last, this play was also rehearsed. Today, it will be performed in two parts, day and night. The lead roles are Liu Hanchen and Sun Pengzhi as Xu Xian, Xue Youqin as Bai Niangniang, and Xie Wenqin as Little Qing.

Carlton

The Yifeng Opera Troupe is staging a play called "Leifeng Pagoda," which will be performed at the daytime performance today along with "Dong Xiaowan." "Fifteen or Sixteen Chapters of Tian Yu Hua" were rehearsed the night before last, and this play was also rehearsed at the same time. Liu Wenkui and Ge Juejiang play Xu Xian; Jin Suwen, Zhang Huicong, Ma Jinfeng, and Qian Shumin play Bai Niangniang; Wang Lanfang, Li Suqiu, and Yang Yanrong play Little Qing. Xin Fang and Xichun are not participating, and it is just for decoration.

Many Peking Opera troupes in the Amusement Park are staging "Legend of the White Snake," so details are not included.

### Charity Performance for Disaster Relief

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's local group has been publicizing its broadcasting and charity performances for a long time. In addition to holding a grand broadcast at the Continental Radio Station on the 17th and 18th, it will also hold charity performances at the Golden Grand Theater on the 26th and 27th of this month, with a total of four performances, day and night. Famous amateur actors from other places who have already joined include Zeng Xinzhai, Zhu Bonian, Ou Shounan, Zhuang Xiaogu, and Li Zaitian. Ladies Wei Xinlu, Xiao Ming, and Fu Yuntai, as well as famous amateur actors from the local Ju Society and Ping Society, are also participating. Amateur actors from other places with drama experience and famous local amateur actors who are happy to participate in the charity performances or broadcasting to jointly support the cause are all welcome. Please contact Mr. Wu Zezhou at 5 Daodeli, Luxon Road, Foch Road. Your participation is greatly appreciated.

### The Golden Dragon Boat

Outside Gengshan Gate in Hangzhou, about ten miles outside the city, there is a mountain called Banshan (Half Mountain), and on the mountain is the Niu Shan Niangniang Temple (Cow Mountain Goddess Temple). Every year from the first day of the fifth lunar month to the tenth, there is a dragon boat race. This year it is the most lively, and there are many spectators. One boat, in particular, has banners that shine and colors that are dazzling. The boats compete to be first, and people point and count them. There are eighteen boats. At noon, they go ashore to eat, and the count is only seventeen boats. Everyone saw that there were eighteen boats, so why is one missing? After eating, they go back to the water to race, and there are eighteen boats again. A local who knows how to swim goes into the water and identifies the brightly colored boat, hurrying forward to ask about its origin. Just as he gets in front of it and grabs an oar, the boat disappears. The oar is still in his hand. He lifts it up and sees that it is made of pure gold. He counts again, and there are only seventeen boats. It turns out that the missing boat is the Golden Dragon Boat.

### Rhyme About Zongzi (Rice Dumpling) Wrappers

Zongzi cannot be made without bamboo leaves, but when eating them, the wrappers are discarded. I saw this and felt moved, so I wrote three seven-character regulated verses, hoping that like-minded people will respond with their own poems. - Draft by a humble old man from western Zhejiang

(1) Through many bindings and windings, with sharp edges and corners, its nature is unique; it exerts itself without knowing that it is just a leaf, cherishing only its perceived value like a pearl. It comes together to harmonize water and fire, hoping to be soaked in grease and oil; the colorful threads and lucky charms are untied together, casually discarded before the feast. (2) Intentionally encompassing hardship, containing sustenance to nourish and fill the people; ultimately yielding soft and delicious grains on the plate, without understanding the world beyond the pot. Suddenly thinking of Guan Zhong and Kuai Kui, without the distinction to offer water chestnuts or water lilies on the pond; enjoying the pleasure of forgetting the trap once the fish is caught, its cause being to fall into the latrine or float on a mat. (3) The pot heats up, often burning beanstalks, boiling the life like a chicken a hundred and one times; why is it necessary to serve the mouth like that, when appearance and fur are insignificant? Knowing from the beginning that it is not a discarded object, perhaps fine silk is embroidered on tender hands; six zhang and five corners are familiar to me, given to the poet to carefully contemplate.
