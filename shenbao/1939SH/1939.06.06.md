Editorial

### The Lanchang Incident

The labor strike at the Lanchang Cotton Mill, owned by British merchants in Pudong, has dragged on for over twenty days, and there is still no news of a resolution. Recently, Lanchang Mill has been advertising in various newspapers, seeking worker-elected representatives for negotiations. We sincerely hope that the sensible and reasonable Lanchang workers can immediately elect representatives to discuss the matter. At the same time, we also hope that the Lanchang authorities can accommodate the workers' demands as much as possible to jointly seek a reasonable resolution to this dispute. Otherwise, the labor strike will continue to drag on, causing great losses to both labor and capital, and it will be a laughingstock to those who stir up trouble. We know that the mill had already announced that it would resume operations on the 29th of last month, and many workers had already prepared to return to the factory. Unexpectedly, a so-called "strike committee" blocked them, threatening those who returned to work, so operations could not resume. Currently, a sinister force has clearly separated labor and capital, and the capitalists cannot find worker representatives to meet and negotiate. This vicious conspiracy should be clearly recognized and deeply reflected upon by both labor and capital in Lanchang.

According to reports, the immediate cause of the strike by two thousand Lanchang workers was the abuse of female workers by a White Russian watchman in the mill. A male worker saw this and spoke out in protest, but was dismissed by the mill. This caused widespread outrage, leading to a collective strike. However, the underlying cause is said to be the mill's reduction of bonuses, which aroused opposition from the workers. Recently, prices have soared, and workers' real wages have decreased by as much as fifty percent. Workers' lives are already struggling under an unbearable burden, and the reduction of bonuses has further deepened widespread dissatisfaction. When the dispute first occurred, it is said that the workers were able to consider the overall situation and elected representatives to negotiate with the mill. However, the mill refused, at which time troublemakers mixed into the mill took the opportunity to incite unrest, creating chaos throughout the mill, and the mill had no choice but to announce the suspension of operations.

Some people with "schadenfreude" seized this opportunity to loudly stir up an anti-British movement. On one hand, they organized a so-called "strike committee" to isolate labor and capital. On the other hand, they tried to bribe and entice workers with sweet words. Fortunately, most of the workers understood the bigger picture and were unwilling to sell themselves to be used as propaganda tools. Now, most of the workers realize that they do not want to escalate the situation, and the mill also hopes to negotiate a resolution with the workers. However, because of the obstruction of this sinister force, the Lanchang Mill has not been able to resume operations to this day.

The Lanchang incident was initially just a local issue, but its subsequent evolution has taken on greater significance. Frankly speaking, the entire industry and commerce of Shanghai is linked to the common interests of all countries, and is a thorn in the side of those who seek to monopolize the Shanghai market. This is true for British merchants, and it is also true for merchants from other countries. Their strategy is to use traitorous elements to infiltrate and disrupt enterprises, and then use the guise of "protecting workers' interests" to incite strikes, leading to factory closures and unemployment. In this way, they can profit from it, seizing both the market and the labor force needed for the market. This Lanchang incident makes this clear to everyone. Therefore, from now on, labor and capital in Shanghai should work together to achieve their practical cooperation and realize that labor and capital are not opposed to each other.

Since the War of Resistance, the workers of Shanghai have indeed shown an unprecedented spirit of self-awareness. They have been able to consider the overall situation and endure everything under the difficult living conditions of high prices and declining wages. This spirit is truly worthy of our admiration. Although some of the capitalists in Shanghai have already achieved preliminary cooperation with labor, most still have a large gap with labor, refusing to accept reasonable demands from labor and refusing to improve the lives of workers. For example, the Lanchang incident may have been caused by this gap. It is said that the Lanchang Mill could earn over ten thousand yuan a day when it was operating, and it must lose over twenty thousand yuan a day after the suspension of operations. To recover the loss of over thirty thousand yuan a day, it is worthwhile for the Lanchang authorities to make some concessions to labor. Therefore, from now on, the capitalists in Shanghai should take the lives of workers into account as much as possible and maintain harmonious cooperation between labor and capital, which today is equivalent to protecting their own interests.

As for labor, from now on, it should also clearly recognize the overall situation and not mistake the current target. It is also necessary to strengthen its own organization to prevent traitorous elements from taking the opportunity to infiltrate, disrupt, and incite. It should be known that in today's pressing national crisis, class consciousness should be completely abandoned.

### Foreign Correspondents Inspect the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia Border: All is Quiet

Hailar, Reuters: After inspecting the "front lines" of the Halha River ("Qian Qian"), a special correspondent for Reuters returned here today. While at the Japanese division headquarters near the "front lines," they overheard Japanese officials say that the total number of planes shot down by the Japanese in the recent air battles near the "Manchukuo"-Outer Mongolia border has increased from 59 to 62. The Japanese side claimed their overwhelming aerial victory has been "fully confirmed." Many Outer Mongolian planes crashed within "Manchukuo," but in the numerous air battles, the Japanese only lost one plane. The 62nd Outer Mongolian plane was shot down on June 2nd by Sergeant Saito, who is a "skilled pilot" for the Japanese. In a recent operation, he single-handedly attacked 28 Outer Mongolian planes. The headquarters also stated that the vast disparity in losses between Outer Mongolia and "Japan" (62 to 1) was due to "the enemy's low morale and poor flying skills." The Reuters correspondent traveled to the "front lines" of the Nomonhan area and saw an endless plain, but everything was quiet. Even with powerful binoculars, they could not see any trace of Outer Mongolian troops. It was reported that since Sergeant Saito shot down the 62nd enemy plane on June 2nd, there have been no more air battles. The Japanese had previously claimed to have shot down 17 enemy planes on May 27th and another 42 on May 29th. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### Japanese Newspaper Declares: The Real Enemy is the Concession within China's Borders: "The Concession Issue Must be Resolved First, With Full Power to Dispose of Them at Will"

(Tokyo) The Tokyo Miyako Shinbun stated: "After fighting in China for two years, we have come to understand the true nature of the China Incident. The only way to resolve the China Incident is to deal effectively with the foreign powers that aid the Chinese government. The true intentions of these countries have been fully revealed in their attitude towards the concessions in China. The landing of British, American, and French armed forces on Gulangyu to demonstrate against Japan has undoubtedly disclosed the nature of their policy towards the China Incident. Britain, America, and France are determined to help China resist Japan, no less than the Soviet Union is active on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border. British, American, and French aid to China is based in the concessions in China. If this is not eliminated, the China Incident will never end. Japan's real enemy is not China, but the concessions within China. This is the central nervous system of the resistance against Japan, as 80% of the military supplies used by China come from the concessions. If we want to overthrow the Chinese government, we must first resolve the problem of the concessions in China. As a belligerent, we have full power to dispose of the public concessions at will." (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### Refugees to Hong Kong Arriving in a Continuous Stream

(Hong Kong) The refugee problem in Hong Kong has become increasingly serious. Therefore, future relief measures should be limited to those that are constructive. Chinese refugees are arriving in Hong Kong in a continuous stream, and relief funds are very limited. Therefore, merely providing refugees with food, clothing, and shelter is not a long-term solution. As a result, some propose finding ways for these people to support themselves and using relief funds as capital for production. Since the promotion of the cooperative movement in mainland China has yielded excellent results, Hong Kong can follow suit. Furthermore, the "South China Morning Post" today advocated for the implementation of a cooperative movement within Hong Kong. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)

The Daily Mail stated: "The Vatican's opposition has become an open secret. Pope Pius XII is deeply concerned that the conclusion of this agreement will allow the Bolsheviks to interfere in European affairs. At the same time, the Vatican is working to promote an international peace conference, hoping that France, Germany, Italy, and Poland can prioritize peace over their own real interests before a democratic country concludes an agreement with the Soviet Union." (Havas dispatch, 5th)

(London) According to messages in this morning's newspapers, the Pope is about to send another message to Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, calling for peace. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express both say that this new appeal is related to the proposed Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance, as the Pope fears its completion would facilitate the intrusion of communism into Europe. According to the News Chronicle, the Pope's appeal will be sent to countries including the United States, Belgium, and South American nations. It is said that the Pope has not abandoned his efforts to persuade all countries to allow Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to resolve disputes. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

(Rome) Regarding the news reported in the British newspapers that the Pope is planning to send another appeal for peace to various countries, sources at the Vatican said that the Pope has not taken any new actions since delivering his address to the College of Bishops on June 2nd. However, the Pope will continue to pursue diplomatic activities through normal channels. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

(London) The Daily Mail recently published a dispatch from its Rome correspondent stating that Pope Pius XII will suggest to the governments of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland that a conference be held to discuss and resolve various outstanding European issues.

Soviet Army Chief Declines Invitation to Visit Britain

(Moscow) The British Army General Staff recently invited Soviet People's Commissar for Defense Voroshilov to visit Britain in September to observe army exercises. According to reliable sources, General Voroshilov has politely declined, saying that the Soviet Army will also be holding exercises at that time and he will be unable to attend. He will send several generals as representatives to observe. Foreign observers here have commented that members of the Politburo of the Soviet Communist Party rarely travel abroad unless there are special circumstances. General Voroshilov is also a member and only traveled to Turkey in 1933 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the republic. This refusal of the British invitation is unlikely to have any connection to the Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

Rumors of Soviet Union Purchasing Huge Ships from Britain

(Moscow) Representatives from the British Vickers arms factory have recently been here to negotiate with the Soviet government. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has ordered huge ships from the factory, with engines worth between £750,000 and £1 million. However, this rumor cannot be confirmed at this time. In addition, various American arms factories have also sent representatives to station here to sell machinery for refining steel plates. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

Germany Actively Engaged in Diplomatic Activities

(Berlin) On April 28th, the German government announced the abolition of both the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. At the same time, the country's newspapers used sarcastic language to describe the negotiations being conducted by Britain with Turkey and the Soviet Union as "alliance sickness." By now, Germany itself seems to have contracted this disease. In March, the country signed an agreement with Lithuania, recovering the Memel region and agreeing not to use force against each other. Since then, it has sought to conclude non-aggression pacts with the Baltic states and the Scandinavian peninsula. Among them, negotiations with Denmark have been completed. Negotiations with Estonia and Latvia were supposed to have concluded half a month ago, but these countries are now wary of the Soviet Union's attitude. As for Yugoslavia, Prince Regent Paul is currently visiting here, and his entourage says that Yugoslavia does not intend to sign any treaties with Germany, has no intention of joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, and does not want to conclude an agreement with Hungary, so as not to hinder Yugoslavia's friendship with Romania. According to informed sources, Germany is actively engaged in diplomatic activities with Spain. Germany has stated that if Britain and the Soviet Union reach an agreement, the German-Italian axis will definitely respond. Regarding this, political figures believe that merely strengthening ties with Japan is not enough, and it is necessary to bring Spain into a military alliance treaty to be the best outcome.

### Japanese Five-Minister Conference: Passing Basic Policies for Addressing the European Situation

(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: Japan's basic policies in the face of the new European situation have been passed by the Five-Minister Conference this morning. Prime Minister Hiranuma is scheduled to enter the Imperial Palace this afternoon to report everything to the Emperor. Hiranuma was originally at his villa in Yono, taking a weekend break. He returned here today and immediately summoned the Ministers of the Army and Navy to continue the discussions from last Saturday, hold discussions on Japan's basic policies, and make a decision. After a decision was reached, the Prime Minister separately summoned Foreign Minister Arita and Finance Minister Ishiwata for discussions, resulting in a final decision. Hiranuma entered the Imperial Palace this afternoon to report everything. Also, Konoe visited Elder Statesman Saionji at his villa this morning to report on Japan's domestic and foreign situation over the past twelve months, including Japan's policies in the new European situation. The two men also freely exchanged opinions on the latter. (Dispatch, 5th)

### British Air Force: Formidable Strength

(London) The increase in the production of British aircraft is rapid, to the point that the storage of manufactured aircraft has become a problem. The Air Force already possesses a large number of the latest aircraft to handle missions with ample surplus. Experts estimate that the British Air Force's strength was quite weak last September, but this has completely changed. If an aggressor country sends aircraft to bomb major British cities, 80% of them will be shot down, and only 20% will be able to fly back to their home country. There are two reasons for this: 1. The quality of new British fighter planes is excellent, and their speed is far superior to that of fighter planes from other countries. 2. Britain has manufactured a large number of anti-aircraft guns, which are capable of defending London. It is expected that the density of their firepower will prevent enemy aircraft from observing. Similar protection can be obtained in other major cities within a short period of time. Military authorities are currently drafting plans to station a large number of new aircraft at key strategic locations in the empire, so that they can effectively occupy an advantageous position in the sky. In addition, the metal used in British aircraft manufacturing is of excellent quality, and the durability of the aircraft is five or six times greater than that of products from Germany and Italy. This is another reason why the British Air Force has an advantage. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### U.S. Secretary of the Navy Reportedly to Be Replaced

(Washington) Rumors continue to circulate here today that U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy will succeed Swanson as Secretary of the Navy. Secretary Swanson is 77 years old and currently in poor health and will retire soon. It was previously rumored that Assistant Secretary of the Navy Edison would take Secretary Swanson's position, but this did not materialize due to poor health. Secretary Swanson has not been to the office for the past few months and the duties of the department have been handled by Admiral Leahy and Edison. President Roosevelt has also participated in the recent U.S. naval expansion plan. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)

### Preparations Complete for U.S. Hospitality to British Monarch

(Washington) According to news here today, all arrangements for welcoming the British King and Queen have been completed.

U.S. Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay, as well as officials from both sides on the welcome committee, are scheduled to depart tomorrow for Buffalo to welcome the British King and Queen to the United States. The last day the British King and Queen will be here is June 11th. After this, the British King and Queen will return to Canada. During this period, the main task of the U.S. government is to wholeheartedly host the British King and Queen and strengthen the friendly relations between the United States and Britain. It is rumored that the British King and Queen will reside at Roosevelt's private residence, Hyde Park. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)

### Spain: Army Completely Reorganized; 1932 Class Reserves Demobilized; Franco Reportedly Chooses New Cabinet

(Burgos): It is claimed here that the Spanish army will soon be completely reorganized. The country will be divided into eight corps districts, each with a commander and three divisions. Special corps will be established in Morocco, the Balearic Islands, and the Canary Islands, with two divisions each. (Associated Press, 4th)

(Paris) According to reports received here last night, after the reorganization of the Spanish cabinet, Franco will appoint his brother-in-law—current Interior Minister Sunner—as the new cabinet premier. As for Franco himself, he will obtain a position equal in power to Hitler. Franco is scheduled to announce this today. It is rumored that the new cabinet will be composed of military personnel and opposed by the Carlists and Royalists. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)

### Czech Intellectual Class Suppressed: Scholar Framed to Serve as a Warning

(Paris) The Droite Hebdo reports that a prominent Czech political commentator, Dr. Sejanina, who served as a judge in the Higher Court of Brno, defended the suspect Lubbe, along with many foreign lawyers, when the trial of the burning of the German Reichstag in 1933 was opened. German authorities now intend to file a public lawsuit accusing him of conspiring to assassinate leading figures of the National Socialist Party (Nazi Party) to punish him. The background of this lawsuit may remind people of the opening of the trial for burning the German Reichstag. The National Socialist Party now wants to use one of the lawyers in that case as the main defendant. Although this is a coincidence, its purpose is because this person is a Czech patriotic activist, a progressive member of the intellectual community, and a representative of the humanitarian spirit promoted by the late Czech President Masaryk. If he can be punished, it will serve as a warning to others. German political police are employing their usual tactics to fabricate evidence to accuse Dr. Sejanina. However, the identity of the National Socialist Party official whom this person allegedly plotted to harm, whether it is Hitler or Aviation Minister General Goering, has not been clarified. The identity of the conspirators and the total number of conspirators are also unknown. In short, the goal of this case is to divert the German people's attention so that they do not pay attention to current domestic policies. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

### German Interior Minister to Visit Hungary

### U.S. Revival of Moral Values Congress: President Roosevelt Sends Letter of Support

(Washington) British figures, such as former Prime Minister Lord Baldwin and famous tennis player Austin, initiated a moral revival movement last year, calling on world public opinion to oppose war. The method they advocated was not to use pacifism, but to resist war with a strong attitude and resolute will. Various circles in the United States responded to this call yesterday and held a conference here. Letters and telegrams were sent by 206 people from the United States and abroad, all of which were read by the chairman. One of President Roosevelt's letters stated: "The moral essence of the people of all countries in the world is the source of strength for the whole world. The moral revival plan promoted by your association can reduce the danger of war, but it must be supported by the whole world to be effective." (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### U.S. Election Situation: Roosevelt's Candidacy Undecided

(New York) The U.S. election is scheduled for November of next year. The preliminary stages of the election will begin in March, when the Democratic and Republican parties will each select delegates to their national conventions. These conventions will then nominate candidates for the general election. In this upcoming election, which candidate from the Democratic and Republican parties has a chance of winning remains highly uncertain. First, regarding the Democratic Party, President Roosevelt has yet to indicate whether he will seek a third term. According to U.S. custom, a president is only allowed to serve two terms. Citing this precedent, the political opponents of President Roosevelt are opposing his running for a third term, arguing that it would lead to the development of "personal authority," which is undesirable. However, those within the government argue that President Roosevelt is the originator of the "New Deal" and that its continued implementation requires him. The core of the "New Deal" is based on labor-management cooperation, and even the Republican Party cannot disregard it. Furthermore, President Roosevelt's foreign policy takes into account historical traditions and the global situation, past and future. It is considered perfect and cannot be criticized or abandoned by the Republican Party. Therefore, it is argued that President Roosevelt must run for a third term. However, after eight years in office, it is impossible to know whether the president will consider retirement. As for the Republican Party, potential candidates either lack prestige or political experience. Dewey, the New York State prosecutor, gained fame from the Hines case (Hines, a prominent Democrat, was arrested last year for illegally issuing lottery tickets using political influence) and is considered promising, but lacks political experience. Additionally, Senators Taft of Ohio and Vandenberg of Michigan are also potential Republican candidates. However, if President Roosevelt decides to run for a third term, the Republican Party must nominate a candidate of comparable stature and, in addition to criticizing the current government's policies, "must also propose a positive and practical platform" to be competitive.

### Finland Decides to Fortify; Åland Islands; Sweden Postpones Action

Finnish Capital According to local reports, Finland has decided to proceed with its fortification plan for the Åland Islands, regardless of Soviet opposition. The Swedish government has postponed submitting the Åland Islands fortification bill to parliament, which is seen here as merely a delay. Finland will not be affected, as the Finnish-Swedish plan was accepted by all signatories of the Åland Convention, and Finland has complete autonomy in its actions. (Haitong dispatch, 5th)

Swedish Capital Swedish newspapers claim that the Swedish government has temporarily postponed submitting the Åland Islands fortification bill to parliament. The goal is to make the Soviet government understand that the Åland Islands fortification plan is not aimed at any party.

### Britain Holds Memorials for Submarine Disaster; Churches and Schools Hold Prayers

(London) Today, the nation mourns the 97 lives lost on the submarine Thetis. Special prayers are being held in cathedrals, parish churches, and on warships across the country. Admiral Forbes, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, has issued a call to 30,000 naval personnel to participate in special memorial services on ships in Portland and at naval land institutions. Those who participated in the attempted rescue of the crew members are holding a brief religious service at the site where Thetis sank. It has been announced that the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Bowater, will launch a London City Council relief fund on June 6 on behalf of the victims' families. The King has sent a telegram to the First Lord of the Admiralty, Earl Stanhope, expressing condolences for the Thetis disaster. Queen Mary has also sent a telegram to comfort the relatives of the victims. Foreign leaders have also sent condolences, including Hitler. On Monday, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, Shakespeare, will present the details of this tragedy in the House of Commons. The nation is waiting with deep concern for the results of the Admiralty's inquiry. It is said that among the 99 victims were the country's best submarine design and construction experts. It has been announced that it will take some time to bring the submarine to the surface. The current attempt is to use floating docks to bring the submarine to a level position and then tow it to a nearby shallow area, or possibly aground on Anglesey beach. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today the cause of the sinking of the new submarine Thetis, saying it was due to water flooding the forward two compartments. The submarine's signaling equipment was destroyed, preventing communication with surface ships. Although smoke signals were sent, they were not immediately detected. A detailed investigation into this tragedy will be conducted publicly. It is not possible to predict when the submarine can be raised. The Prime Minister then expressed the government and the House's condolences for the loss of many useful lives and offered comfort to the families of the deceased. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### French Government's Policies Supported by Radical Socialists

(Paris) The executive committee of the Radical Socialist Party, the ruling party, unanimously passed a resolution expressing support for the current government's domestic and foreign policies. The speech given by party leader Daladier was also warmly praised by the committee members. He stated that France is determined to resist the aggression, coercion, and arbitrary self-sufficiency, the agitation of hot-headed ideas, and the demands made under the pretext of vital space. The committee members approved of this declaration. Deputy Party Chairman Mistral also gave a speech stating, "The mutual assistance agreements signed by Britain and France with certain countries are defensive in nature, showing that we have no intention of encircling Germany. If Germany wants to conduct economic negotiations with democratic countries, it must first recognize that the era of force is over. As for the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the common goal is to establish a genuine, equal, and mutually beneficial assistance agreement. It is hoped that the Soviet Union will show a spirit of compromise so that success can be achieved soon." (Havas dispatch, date unclear)

### Germans in Yugoslavia Oppose Land Purchase Restrictions; German Foreign Minister Fetes Yugoslav Regent

Capital of Yugoslavia German residents in Yugoslavia have been extensively purchasing land in the Sava and Danube River regions near the border. The Yugoslav military authorities are concerned that this is at the instigation of the German government, with the intention of creating so-called "vital space" as a foundation for future expansion. The government has therefore determined regulations to restrict this. German leaders have risen up in opposition and petitioned the government. The government authorities have now promised to revise the restrictions or even abolish them. (Havas, 4th)

### Germany Demands Release of Czech Gold Stored in London; Majority of British MPs Oppose Delivery

(London) The House of Commons will reconvene tomorrow, and the issue of Germany's demand for the release of Czech gold stored in London will be discussed. Political figures are studying this issue. According to financial authorities, there are two batches of Czech gold. The first batch, worth £5 million, belongs to the Czech National Bank and was deposited in London through the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) at the end of March. It was then taken by the Czech National Bank to Prague, where it fell into German hands. The second batch, worth £6.5 million, was directly deposited in London by the Czech National Bank and has been seized by the British government under a law passed by Parliament. Germany is demanding this batch. Representatives from Britain and Germany have already held negotiations, but without success. The British argument is that since the Czech National Bank is the direct successor to the Czech state, the gold should be used to offset Czech claims held within the country. This is seen as a way to avoid recognizing the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The German side argues that the Czech National Bank is independent, and using its deposits to pay off the debts of the former Czech state is illegal. Since the first batch of gold was handed over to the Czech National Bank, a majority of MPs have opposed it. If the second batch of gold is released, opposition will be even stronger, potentially threatening the government's position. Therefore, it is unlikely that Britain and Germany can continue negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon repeated in the House of Commons today about the Czech gold held by the Bank of England, saying that he had consulted legal experts, who all advised the British government not to take any action to prevent the Bank of England from complying with the instructions of its client, the Bank for International Settlements, to hand over the gold to the designated party. If the Treasury does not allow the transfer, it would be violating treaty obligations, and the Treasury cannot obtain a court ruling that it has the right to prevent the Bank of England from complying with the order.

### Mexico Fire Kills 70

Mexico City A movie theater in the village of Chiatla de Tapia, Morelos province, suddenly caught fire tonight. Due to the flammable building materials, the entire theater was destroyed within seven minutes. There were 800 people in the theater at the time. Upon hearing the fire alarm, everyone tried to escape, resulting in trampling and deaths, mostly children. The situation was tragic. The fire spread rapidly, affecting 30 farmhouses in the village. The security team stationed at a nearby sugar factory claimed they had not received orders to leave the factory and stood by without helping. By the time the fire brigade arrived, it was too late. The military and police gradually arrived and worked with the fire brigade to put out the fire, saving the remaining houses. An investigation revealed that 70 people died in the fire, and 150 were injured. It was a disaster. (Havas dispatch, date unclear)

### Under Japanese Military Aggression, North China Forms Two Areas; Chinese and Japanese Armies Each Control Their Own Territory; But It Is Extremely Difficult for the Japanese Army to Eliminate Guerrillas; Vast Plains Are Held by Guerrillas

The Zi Lin Bao's May 15th Beijing dispatch states that many people in Chinese towns, whose real homes and families are in inland villages, must have lost contact with their families. North China has been clearly divided into two areas, with no communication between them. One side is the towns occupied by the Japanese military and the surrounding small rural areas, connected by narrow railways. The other side is the vast inland area, most of which has not been ravaged by aggressors and is still under Chinese control. Now, the Japanese authorities often dislike it when people want to go inland, and it is not easy to make the trip, because between the two areas, there is often a "no-man's land," continuously made up of burnt or destroyed villages, and guerrillas who are not bound by either side stay there. Therefore, it is now difficult to find out the situation in the inland areas. Only by occasionally meeting some missionaries who live inland, or a small number of Chinese intellectuals who try to sneak back into the occupied areas, can we get a glimpse of the inland situation. Now, the current situation of the areas controlled by the Chinese and Japanese in North China (northeast of the Yellow River) is outlined as follows:

(1) Inner Mongolia is somewhat under Japanese military control, but the Japanese have not tried to properly garrison it.

(2) Suiyuan The railway, and the towns along the road, and the narrow strip of land, are all in the hands of the Japanese army, but the countryside south of the railway line, and the vast area west of Baotou, the end station of the line, are still held by the Chinese army.

(3) Chahar The northern area outside the Great Wall and the narrow strip of land along the Pingzhang Railway are under Japanese military control.

(4) Shanxi After three long and strenuous efforts to expel the guerrillas, the central plateau, the west and south of Taiyuan, and the narrow strip of land along the narrow-gauge Tongpu Railway, all the way to the Yellow River, are now in the hands of the Japanese army. The rest of the province is still under the control of the Chinese army.

(5) Hebei The east (that is, what is called Jidong), between the Beining Railway and the Great Wall, is still called quiet (remember that before July 1937, this area was already in the hands of the Japanese army). In the central part, the Japanese army has proclaimed that it has "eliminated" the guerrillas as far as halfway to the Yellow River.

(6) Shandong The area connecting the two railways, and north of the Yellow River, is still called quiet, but the mountainous areas and cape areas in the central part of the province are still in the hands of the Chinese army. Even in the area along the railway, where Japanese troops are stationed, it often presents an unstable situation. Many important railway lines are still far from being tranquil, and the railway lines that go deep inland can only be used for military purposes.

Railway Lines and Mining Areas

The Pinghan Line has been repeatedly attacked and destroyed, as has the Pingsui Road between Zhangjiakou and Suiyuan. The damage to the Pingsui Road line is so severe that trains have not been running for several weeks. The Datong Coal Mine on the Pingsui Road in northern Shanxi has been damaged in recent weeks and cannot operate, as is the Tuoli Coal Mine in Xishan, not far from Peiping. There have been repeated reports of the destruction of trains, resulting in a shortage of trains, which are not even enough to meet the drastically reduced passenger and freight services in these areas. Given this situation, it is not surprising that the Japanese have occupied North China for almost two years and still cannot carry out economic development.

The Largest Independent Area

The largest independent area of the Chinese side is in the vast mountainous area west of the Pinghan Road, containing parts of the provinces of Jin, Sui, Cha, and Ji, forming a strong area with a population of 14 million. This area once included the entire central Hebei. At the beginning of the Japanese invasion in 1937, most of the local governments were destroyed. In the period after the Japanese army retreated or passed through, the administration was in complete chaos. In early 1938, representatives from areas not directly occupied by the Japanese army held a meeting in Fuping, a small town west of Baoding near the border of Jin, to organize what they called a district government to take over the administrative power of the areas that could still be independent. This is a mobile government, operating in a way that is suitable for dealing with frequent attacks by the Japanese army. For half a year, the government had time to consolidate its position and gradually restore order in various counties. Last November, a large number of Japanese reinforcements arrived in North China, and from the east and the south, that is, the Pinghan Road and the Jinpu Road, they launched a large-scale invasion to eliminate central Hebei. After repeated battles, lasting five months, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses before occupying towns as far as halfway to the south bank of the Yellow River. Later, because it was discovered that their system of invading and then retreating did not achieve satisfactory results, they decided to change their method and began to garrison larger towns in central Hebei. For this reason, 50,000 reinforcements continued to arrive in North China in March and April, and immediately poured into a vast area, but the area was vast and the troops were few, so they still felt that the distribution was insufficient. Therefore, even with reinforcements, it cannot be said that central Hebei has been effectively occupied. The guerrillas still hold the countryside and hide in thousands of villages scattered like stars across the vast plain. Because the guerrillas had demolished the walls of most towns before leaving, the Japanese army had to guard behind barbed wire obstacles and showed an unstable appearance, and had no power in the surrounding areas. Even if the Japanese army has occupied a city, it has no confidence in "pacifying" the countryside, because it is becoming increasingly difficult to find people to carry out any kind of local administration. When the Japanese army approaches a city, the people are ordered to leave the city, and only hooligans stay behind to work under the command of the Japanese army. This is a dangerous job, because if they are caught by the guerrillas, they will be executed by shooting. The farmers in the surrounding areas no longer bring agricultural products into the already barren cities, so the Japanese army has to transport all supplies by truck from the nearest railway station. The guerrillas have dug trenches six feet deep across the roads, greatly hindering truck transportation. The supply of raw cotton, one of the purposes of the Japanese invasion of North China, has also become a fantasy, because the guerrillas have advised farmers not to plant cotton anymore, so the output is said to have decreased by 80%. According to the current policy, it is difficult to understand how the Japanese army can hope to establish an effective administrative body to handle affairs in the entire North China region and restore peace and order in the interior. The actions that the Japanese army had previously taken, and are still continuing to take in other parts of the interior, to attack and destroy villages, and blame the guerrillas, can only increase the chaos, force more people to join the team, and greatly increase the difficulty of supplying and transporting the Japanese army. The recent plan to garrison all the occupied towns in the interior, if properly garrisoned, may be more effective, but it is more useless and worse to do so with insufficient military strength. In any case, the Japanese army has still not been able to occupy the vast mountainous areas. Some experts believe that the Japanese army needs to redeploy at least 500,000 people to begin to eliminate North China, but the Japanese army seems unwilling to do so, so it is difficult to predict when and how the Japanese army will be able to complete this task. After the matter is completed, they will return to Japanese warships.

### Japanese Soldiers from Daishan Go to Changtu Island to Search; After the Matter Is Completed, They Return to Japanese Warships

Dinghai Communication Changtu Island, which belongs to the county, is located east of Daishan. It was landed on by Japanese soldiers in January last year, and they did not withdraw until March. After the Japanese army landed on Daishan on the 22nd of last month, Japanese warships also came to Changtu to spy on the island from time to time. At about 9:00 a.m. on the 27th, two Japanese warships from Daishan arrived again. They launched four motorboats, carrying more than 80 Japanese soldiers, and landed on the shore in droves in the area of ​​Waijingtou Dinghai Bay. More than 40 Japanese soldiers landed at Niangjigong Shengdoushan Zhengyimiao, and successively searched villages in the area of ​​Shangxia Street. They did not withdraw and return to the warships until the evening.

### The Japanese Army Is Desperate; The Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu Has a Huge Momentum; Yu and Gu's Troops Total 200,000; A Siege of Xuzhou Has Already Been Formed; The Japanese Army's Demonstration Was Just a Paper Tiger

Xinghua Communication There are now more than 200,000 Chinese troops in northern Jiangsu, one-third of whom are the Yan Zhao warriors of Yu Xuezhong's troops, distributed in the counties of Pi, Pei, Feng, Dang, Xiao, Guanyun, Suqian, etc. on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong, forming a large encirclement of Xuzhou. One-third are the troops of Gu Zhutong, that is, the basic troops of the commander of the Jiangsu-Shandong Border Region and the Jiangsu Provincial Security Office, half of whom are from other provinces and half of whom are natives. Because Gu has too many important positions, the actual person in charge of this aspect is the acting chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Han Deqin. Their distribution area is in the counties of Funing, Huai'an, Yancheng, Xinghua, Dongtai, Gaoyou, Taixian, Taixing, etc., and the countryside of the counties of Yang, Ru, Tong, Hai, Chong, and Jing. The remaining one-third are completely local strong men's teams from various counties. Although their weapons and organization are not as good as regular troops, their enthusiasm for protecting their hometown is extremely high, but they lack political training, so this real popular force cannot fully exert its effectiveness, which is a pity.

Because these more than 200,000 troops are protecting northern Jiangsu, the Japanese cannot plunder materials at will like they do in the counties of Suzhou and Wuxi. On the contrary, in the county towns of Xuzhou, Yangzhou, Tongzhou, Jingjiang, etc., which the Japanese army can occupy, they not only dare not take a step out of the city, but are also as panicked as if they were "living from hand to mouth." They have absolutely no chance to rest from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day. Perhaps because they feel that their numbers are small, they follow the orders of their superiors hiding in the cellar and run aimlessly on the streets every day. It is said that this is to show that their strength is not weak. In fact, because of the small number of soldiers, in the past, there were many "cannons" wrapped in oilcloth and hundreds of thousands of "ammunition boxes"夹着 in each marching team, which seemed like "sufficient equipment and ammunition." But now these "paper tigers" have been pierced through. This happened in mid-April. When the Japanese army was flaunting its power, the Chinese army used lightning-fast surprise tactics to smash them to pieces and flee in all directions. In addition to some usable baggage, what was left behind was that the so-called "cannons" were actually model wooden "cannons" from the exhibition, and what was装 in the boxes were broken tiles and rubble. From this, we can see the Japanese army's desperate situation.

### Dongting Mountain Loquats; Heavy Taxes and Difficult Transactions; Traffic Blocked, Cannot Be Transported Out

Suzhou Communication The eastern and western mountains of Dongting, which belong to the county, are suitable for planting fruit trees due to the soil quality, so the annual output of fruits is very large. Most of the people in the two mountains rely on this income to make a living. Among them, loquats are the best, with white sand being the best. This year's loquats in the two mountains, thanks to the mild climate and harmonious rainfall, are full of golden trees and bear a lot of fruit. After the farmers pick them, they load them into boats to the city, trying to transport them to various places for sale, intending to use the surplus from the harvest to make up for the losses caused by the Japanese bombing the previous year. But things did not go as they wished, and the heavy taxes imposed by the puppet county government greatly raised the price, making it difficult for ordinary buyers to trade. Also, because traffic is blocked everywhere, they cannot be transported out to meet the market. Therefore, a large number of loquat boats are still搁置 at the Shuimenwai Wharf in this county, and the farmers in the two mountains are anxiously due to the heavy taxes imposed by the puppet county government.

### "Seeking Fortune" Steamer Searched by Japanese Warship Outside Zhenhai Port

Correspondent from Ningbo: The German-owned "Seeking Fortune" steamer of the "He Yang" shipping company, departed from Shanghai for Ningbo on the 27th of last month. When raising anchor, it was thoroughly inspected by a Japanese customs officer and Japanese marine patrol officer from the Jianghai Customs. This took a very long time before the vessel was allowed to proceed. On the 28th, around 4 PM, when it arrived near Qili Island outside Zhenhai Port, it was again encountered by a Japanese warship. The warship used signal lights to order the steamer to stop for inspection. Subsequently, five soldiers boarded the vessel for another search, questioning the crew in detail. Because the steamer was German-owned and carrying only a small amount of relief grain, without any passengers, the Japanese soldiers found no reason to remain and returned to their ship.

### Opening of Spring Cocoon Market in Suzhou and Wuxi, Prohibition of Resale to Foreign Merchants by the Puppet Regime

Correspondent from Wuxi: The cocoon markets in Suzhou, Wuxi, Chengwu, and other counties have mostly opened. This year, there are many sericulture farmers in the countryside. The weather has also been favorable, and the silkworms are developing very well. Unfortunately, they are affected by the high price of mulberry leaves, leading to insufficient feed or the discarding of leaves in the fields. The highest price for cocoons is eighty yuan. Suzhou cocoon merchants consider the cocoons from Guangfu in Dongting Mountain and Xishan to be the best. Wuxian cocoon merchants, considering the cocoon prices to be too high, have sent representatives, including Xu Haoran, to the puppet regime to request further price reductions. The puppet regime claims that due to soaring silk prices, cocoon merchants collecting cocoons in the interior must adhere to their regulations, limiting purchases to those who spin silk for their own use. Otherwise, all hiring or entrusting purchases at cocoon markets is prohibited. If cocoons are later sold to foreign merchants, their business will be suspended. Although there are no problems for cocoon merchants collecting goods within guerrilla areas in villages and towns, obstacles arise when transporting goods through Japanese and puppet-controlled port cities. The puppet regime's prohibition is intended to increase its revenue. Cocoon merchants are currently devising countermeasures. If calculated based on cost, silk prices will inevitably be high in the future, and the increased cost of raw materials for silk fabrics will also lead to price increases.

### Glorious Battle Record of Feng Denggao

A soldier named Feng Denggao from a certain cavalry division fought a glorious battle against the Japanese army in Suiyuan. The details of his defense in the battle of Xiachenwan in Qingshuihe are as follows: On the 27th of last month, a certain division engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in Xiangshuba, Qingshuihe. Feng Denggao, a private first class from the communication platoon of a certain regiment, was ordered to retreat. On the afternoon of the 28th, while resting in Xiachenwan village by the river, he discovered Japanese cavalry invading from the east. The villagers scattered in all directions, but Feng remained alone in the village. He aimed and shot at six Japanese cavalrymen, killing three of them. A large force of two or three hundred Japanese soldiers, stationed at Taierliang four or five li away from Xiachenwan, were obstructed by the forward patrol. They immediately occupied the mountain peaks and fired machine guns and small cannons at Xiachenwan. Feng continuously returned fire and changed direction to confuse the Japanese. Later, the Japanese army realized there was no large force in Xiachenwan and surrounded the village. Fortunately, a certain regiment of the Suiyuan Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army arrived to provide assistance, and the Japanese army retreated. In this battle, Feng killed several Japanese soldiers and caused the Japanese army to expend a large amount of ammunition. Feng himself fought hard for a day, and only his trouser legs were pierced by two bullets. Feng is from Fan County, Shandong Province, and is twenty-six years old.

### Guerrilla Activities Near Wusong, Japanese Army Bombards Wusong, Lasting Twenty Minutes, "Yihe" Steamer Reportedly Attacked by Gunfire Unconfirmed

The "Continental News" reports: It has been learned that yesterday (the 4th) from 10:00 AM to noon, the Japanese army in Wusong bombarded the area, with artillery fire directed towards Puxiyuan (transliteration), a small village nine li west of Wusong. Yesterday afternoon, the "Yihe" steamer of Jardine Matheson returned here from Qidong, confirming the sound of artillery fire. According to several crew members of the "Yihe" steamer, shortly after 10:00 AM yesterday, the steamer was anchored outside Wusong when it received a notification from the Jardine Matheson company here about which wharf to dock at. For twenty minutes, they clearly heard twelve to fifteen heavy artillery shells, clearly aimed at Puxiyuan. Observers here firmly believe that there are strong Chinese guerrilla forces in Puxiyuan and its suburbs, which have recently been actively attacking the Japanese army. Several Chinese warships previously seized by the Japanese army were piloted by Japanese crew members and docked in Qidong yesterday, for unknown reasons, causing slight panic among the people of Qidong. As a result, there were fewer passengers and goods coming to Shanghai yesterday. News received here on Saturday and Sunday nights claimed that the "Yihe" steamer was attacked by gunfire from the Japanese army or the Chinese side. This claim was denied by the crew members of the steamer. It is believed that because the "Yihe" steamer was near the bombardment site in Wusong, and it was reported that the area was once not very peaceful, it led to the rumor that the "Yihe" steamer was attacked. Another report states that since the occupation of Wusong, the Japanese army has planned to use it as a base for military rest and recuperation. Therefore, many wooden barracks have been built at Paotaiwan, Zhanghuabang, Tongji University, and other places. After the start of the war, Songzhen often had ten to twenty thousand or several thousand Japanese soldiers residing in the barracks. Since last year, the number of troops stationed in Wusong has gradually decreased, and most of the barracks are empty. Recently, there have been even fewer troops, except for a small number of the Tanaka Tomo Engineering Corps, which initially had five hundred men but now only has two hundred, and the military police. The other Japanese troops have all been transferred away. According to people in Wusong, these troops come and go frequently, but now, those who are transferred to Wusong for rest from the front line stay for at most a week before being transferred elsewhere. Therefore, there are often days when Songzhen is completely empty. Judging from the busy movement of troops, it is evident that they truly have no soldiers to spare in their country, and the Japanese troops in China have to increase aid in the east and west and are exhausted. With the garrison in Wusong being so empty, the few engineering corps and military police stationed there are constantly in a state of fear and anxiety. After the puppet squad leader Cao Jinhua was kidnapped by the Wusong guerrilla force on the night of the 28th of last month, the Japanese army became very fearful. In addition to special martial law, the Shanghai-Wusong train only runs to Gaojingmiao and no further north, causing suspicion and anxiety among the residents of Wusong.

### Frequent Artillery Battles Outside Wenzhou Port, Situation Remains Tense, Merchants from Other Provinces Exchange Both Local Goods and Payment

The positions at Shitou outside Wenzhou Port were bombarded by Japanese warships on the 29th and 30th of last month. On the 31st, the Yueqing defense area was also bombarded. The garrison returned fire, resulting in fierce battles. Although Japanese warships left the waters of Wenzhou starting from the 1st of this month, the local situation remains tense, and the garrison is particularly vigilant. The Wenzhou County Government, considering the constant harassment by Japanese aircraft and warships, has, after deliberation, thoroughly evacuated the population and goods. The measures include: 1. Regarding the population, all elderly and weak individuals, except for able-bodied men, will be evacuated. 2. All schools in Wenzhou will be temporarily relocated to rural areas. 3. Regarding goods, most merchants have already evacuated to rural areas. If merchants from other provinces come to Wenzhou to purchase goods, both local goods and payment will be exchanged.

### British Fleet Commander, Admiral Noble, Departs for Hong Kong This Morning, Sailing on HMS Birmingham, Two British Gunboats to Be Dismantled

### French Ambassador Departs Shanghai Yesterday, Sailing to Haiphong on French Cruiser and Transferring to Chongqing, Will Visit Chinese Authorities for Courtesy Call

Following several meetings between the British, American, and French ambassadors in Shanghai, American Ambassador Johnson left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the 31st of last month, en route to Washington. French Ambassador Cosme departed Shanghai yesterday morning at 11:40 AM aboard the French cruiser Lamotte-Picquet, heading directly to Haiphong and then Chongqing. Accompanying him were General Texe, commander of the French Far East Naval Forces, and the ambassador's secretary, Laureames. Those who came to the pier to see them off included French Consul General in Shanghai, Baugé, and senior embassy officials. The Bund pier in the French Concession was temporarily under special guard by the police. It is reported that all Shanghai office affairs will be handled by the secretary, Baiset Zhong, who arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the 31st of last month. It is reported that after arriving in Haiphong, the French Ambassador will take the Yunnan-Vietnam railway to Kunming, and then fly from Kunming to Chongqing to handle embassy affairs and plans to make a normal courtesy call to the Chinese authorities.

### Three American Submarines Depart in Formation

Three American submarines, numbers 36, 38, and 40, have been in Shanghai for two weeks, berthed between pontoons 30 and 31 in Yangshupu. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the three submarines raised anchor in succession and departed in formation. Their destination is unknown.

### "Lanchang" Labor Strike Seeking Resolution, Management Expresses Sympathy for Workers, Puppet Organization Actively Involved

The strike at the British-owned Lanchang Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, has lasted nearly two weeks. The management, deeply sympathetic to the experiences of the workers in Pudong, has notified all workers to elect representatives to meet with the general company office on Sichuan Road at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 5th) and stated that they would sympathetically consider reasonable demands. However, according to yesterday's investigation, the "China Worker's Allied Association" in Pudong is actively involved in the strike. The workers have received various threats and have not dared to openly gather to elect representatives to negotiate with the company. Therefore, there has been no opportunity for face-to-face discussion between labor and management. However, it is said that a solution may be possible soon.

### Japanese Obstructing Foreign Vessels from Clearing Customs, Various Countries Seeking Response, "Wantong" Steamer Changes Destination, "Niuzhuang" Steamer Also Diverted to North China

Previously, the Japanese Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs notified that starting June 1st, ships sailing in the nine Jianghai ports must obtain prior permission from the Japanese Navy and Army and be issued a permit. When clearing customs, the customs clearance application and the Japanese permit must be submitted to the extra Customs Commissioner for approval before customs can be cleared and the ship can sail. As a result, last Saturday, the "Wantong" steamer of the British Swire Company, which operates on the Haimen-Qidong route, was denied clearance because it did not have the above-mentioned procedures. Although the company reported this to the British Consulate General requesting negotiation, it was Saturday, and the consulate was closed for the afternoon. The "Wantong" steamer was scheduled to depart yesterday (the 4th) morning according to the regular schedule, but due to the denial of customs clearance, it had to temporarily suspend sailing pending a resolution. Yesterday was Monday, but there was still no news from the British Consulate. To maintain the schedule and avoid losses, the company changed the destination yesterday to Qinglong Port, Sanhe Port, and other names for customs clearance, which was then approved. The ship is scheduled to resume sailing at 6:00 AM this morning. Furthermore, the "Niuzhuang" steamer of the same company, originally scheduled to depart this afternoon for Xiamen, as well as Wanxu and Quanzhou, was also afraid of being refused clearance because Xiamen and Quanzhou are also on the prohibited list. Therefore, the route was changed to Qingdao and Tianjin, scheduled to depart on the 8th. According to shipping merchants, ships operating in Xingang (Jingjiang), Xinshengang (Tongzhou), Zhangjiagang, Nituogang, Dongjiegang, and other places are still often obstructed when loading and unloading goods, even with permits, making the future of the shipping industry very pessimistic. Beisha is slightly more lenient because the Japanese army occupies fewer ports. It is said that the Japanese army in Zhangjiagang suddenly withdrew voluntarily the day before yesterday, and the reason is unknown.

Negotiations by Various Countries

The incident caused by the unauthorized announcement by Japanese Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, Koichi Oyama, obstructing foreign vessels from clearing customs, has drawn great attention from the authorities of Britain, the United States, and France, who have decided to take joint action to maintain treaty rights and the administrative sovereignty of the customs. In addition to British Consul General in Shanghai, Philip, conferring with Customs Commissioner Robert in recent days to stop the illegal actions of the Japanese Customs Commissioner, the US Consulate in Shanghai has also sent personnel to the Customs to investigate the truth. The French Consulate will also take the same attitude towards this case. However, the German and Italian authorities are still watching and have not expressed any position. Whether they have tacit agreement for Japanese concessions will be judged by their future attitudes.

### Japanese Military Police Arrest Fifteen Chinese, Japanese Newspaper Claims They Are Anti-Japanese Elements, Including Team Leader Gao Taoyun

The Shanghai Times reports that the Japanese-language "Continental News" stated yesterday (the 4th) that on May 15th, Japanese military police searched a terrorist base near Kangnaowan Road in Western Shanghai and captured fifteen Chinese members of the "Iron Blood Assassination Squad," an anti-Japanese organization, including team leader Gao Taoyun, 28, and deputy team leader Chen Guosheng, 27. Gao is directly related to the assassination of Geng Shubo, the detective squad leader of the Caojiadu branch of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, on February 1st next to Kangnaot Road. During the search, five pistols and two hand grenades were seized. Gao was formerly a detective of the Nanshi Police Bureau. After the fall of Shanghai, he fled to Pudong. When Japanese troops appeared in Pudong, Gao pretended to be the chairman of the Yunjiabao (transliteration) Maintenance Association. He obtained contact with Xu Kangdong (transliteration), the guerrilla leader in the area. In addition to providing the Chinese irregular army with information on the movements of the Japanese army, he also used his position to raise funds for the guerrillas under the guise of taxation. When the Japanese authorities became suspicious, Gao secretly left Pudong one night and entered the French Concession. In December of last year, he was ordered by a certain guerrilla leader in Zhenru to serve as the team leader of the Iron Blood Assassination Squad. Chen was previously a rice merchant in Pudong. In September of last year, he joined the guerrilla force and operated in the Yangjia Town and Linjiafang (both transliterations) areas. In January, he was introduced by Gao to join the terrorist group, responsible for fundraising and intelligence work in the Caojiadu area.

### President Coolidge Arrives in Shanghai Today, Passengers Can Arrive at the New Customs Wharf at 5:00 PM

The President Coolidge of the American President Lines arrived in Shanghai from the United States on the 28th of last month, passing through Hong Kong to Little Luzon. It has now departed from Little Luzon and is returning to the United States. The company received a telegram from the ship yesterday stating that it is expected to arrive at 3:30 PM today.

It is reported that there are many passengers on this ship traveling from Luzon to the United States via Shanghai. There are 149 passengers arriving in Shanghai and 525 passengers traveling from Shanghai to the United States, totaling 674 passengers.

### Speculators Order Saigon Rice, Rice Industry Pays Close Attention, Order Quantity About 30,000 Bags, Most Agree to Cancel After Persuasion

Previously, due to soaring rice prices in Shanghai, affecting the livelihood of ordinary people, various rice industry associations in the city suggested that the concession authorities order foreign rice to alleviate the situation. The authorities refused, citing sufficient rice reserves in Shanghai. However, the associations' suggestion was intended as a promotional measure to stabilize prices. Unexpectedly, some grain merchants specializing in speculation secretly ordered 2,000 tons of Saigon rice from overseas. According to investigations, the actual amount reached 2,800 tons, approximately 30,000 bags. It is said that a second batch is also being negotiated. Various rice industry associations, upon learning of this news, paid close attention. To conserve national resources and balance foreign exchange, they have vigorously advised all members not to purchase excessive foreign rice for support. As a result of this advice, some merchants who were negotiating to order a second batch of foreign rice have agreed to cancel the order. According to reports from related parties, since the outbreak of the war, the value of foreign rice imports through the Tianjin and Guangzhou customs has reached as high as 40 to 50 million yuan, which, including foreign wheat flour, accounts for the second largest share of imported goods.

Shanghai Rice Reserves Increase by Over 10,000 Bags

The Soybean and Rice Industry Association announced the total number of rice reserves for the tenth time, totaling 578,959 bags, an increase of 16,769 bags compared to the previous survey report. The reserves of each warehouse are listed as follows: Bank of China 100,213 bags, Bank of Communications 5,763 bags, Zhejiang Industrial and Xizha 91,921 bags, Shanghai First Warehouse 10,133 bags, Shanghai Second Xiechangde 2,536 bags, Industrial Bank 48,452 bags, Reclamation Bank 240 bags, China First Trust 313 bags, Local Bank 10,783 bags, Jin City 5,360 bags, Zehua 22,132 bags, Jiangsu Second Warehouse 2,729 bags, Donglai 3,876 bags, Zikang 9,445 bags, Hengfeng 1,235 bags, Longmao 23,418 bags, Yuanxing 124 bags, Yuanxiang 1,231 bags, Shengji 901 bags, Yongsheng 600 bags, Taikang 450 bags, Zhenfeng (North and South warehouses) 6,500 bags, Dafengchang 383 bags, Zhengda 3,316 bags, Dayouyu 5,771 bags, Dade Xinbei 1,245 bags, Yongxing 484 bags, Xinchangda 670 bags, Gongji 1,213 bags, Hengyigong 4,008 bags, Xinyu 4,430 bags, Dade Xinzhong 6,140 bags, Chengyi 390 bags, Xianmao 410 bags, Hengda 5,872 bags, Dade Xinnan 5,145 bags, Jutaihe 105 bags, Hengxingyi 229 bags, Jiangnan 5,229 bags, Yixingfeng 4,455 bags, Jiuda 1,094 bags, Wanchang 1,803 bags, Qinyi 2,012 bags, Heji 550 bags, Yucheng 809 bags, Hengtai 494 bags, Qiada 850 bags, Zhang Xieji 850 bags, Wanshengsheng 515 bags, Yusheng 525 bags, Wanshengtai 431 bags, Yixin 2,180 bags, Zhiji 320 bags, Zaitong 859 bags, Maotai 35,572 bags, Xichangde 1,702 bags, Qingshengyi 885 bags, Tongshen 4,004 bags, Roosevelt 2,200 bags, Taigu 55,007 bags, Changyiheng 1,011 bags, Dingtaide 13,972 bags, An Shen (two warehouses) 10,842 bags, Xinfeng 628 bags, Hufeng Xinyuan 12,881 bags, Renhe 420 bags, Xieda 561 bags, Zaixing 4,900 bags, Yuanmao 270 bags, Dingyu 10,562 bags, Yuantong 2,658 bags, Dingxing 5,050 bags, Dinghe 25,897 bags, Heji 13,192 bags, Huang Changsheng 1,965 bags, Tongfa 223 bags, Deng Rentai 1,778 bags, Fengsheng 1,231 bags, Hengxinshun 250 bags, Tongshenghang 329 bags, Wankang 100 bags, Hengxingan 562 bags, Wantai Xiang 915 bags, Pinghe 393 bags, Xieji 420 bags.

Smooth Supply and Stable Market

About 40,000 to 50,000 bags of Ke Xian rice were shipped from Wuhu to Shanghai last week. Vendors and merchants, noting the abundant inventory there, traveled long distances to procure it, resulting in demand exceeding supply and driving up prices in the production area. Consequently, fewer goods arrived in the past two days. In addition, about 7,000 to 8,000 bags were transported from Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Changshu, Kunshan, and from the South, including Tongli, Beixie, Zhangyan, Songjiang, Fengjing, Jiashan, and Jiaxu, resulting in a buoyant supply. In recent days, the market has seen an increase in spot goods, and the rice reserves in all rice stores are sufficient. Transactions have resulted in supply exceeding demand, and prices have gradually declined. Except for the highest grade white japonica rice, which is still selling at 10.12 yuan, other grades of rice have generally returned to prices close to the 15 yuan limit. With the weather becoming warmer, rice prices are expected to fall further.

### French Embassy Counselor Discusses the Life of a Diplomat, Like the Wandering Life of Gypsies, Farewell Banquet Held for Noble's Return Home

The North-China Daily News reports that French Embassy Counselor Noble is about to leave Shanghai. His friends held a farewell banquet at the French Handball Association on Saturday. Noble, in his reply, first expressed his gratitude to those who attended to send him off, then compared the life of a diplomat to the wandering life of Gypsies. He said that he came to Shanghai in 1937 at the beginning of the war and has to say goodbye after a short time, but he will always have pleasant memories of the city and expresses optimism about the future of Shanghai. It is said that Noble will soon return to France with his family.

### After Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Ningbo, Attempt to Cover Up Atrocities, Claiming Military Installations, But Bombing Sites Are All Commercial Areas

After the urban area of Ningbo was bombed eight times by Japanese planes, it was unexpectedly attacked for the ninth time at 9:30 AM on the 3rd. The bombed sites were all commercial areas. The Japanese Fleet Press Department issued a statement on the afternoon of the 4th, claiming that "on the 3rd, powerful units of the Naval Air Force carried out reconnaissance attacks near Ningbo, bombing military facilities and military supply warehouses on the riverbank." According to related organizations, all of the sites hit in the nine bombings of Ningbo were shops and residences, and all the dead and wounded were innocent civilians. Ningbo has always been an undefended city with no so-called military facilities. The Japanese are using the attack on military facilities as an excuse, clearly attempting to cover up their atrocities of indiscriminate devastation.

### Over a Hundred Japanese Soldiers Landed on Changtu Island, Returned to Their Ships at Night, Seemingly Not Intending to Occupy for Long, Japanese Warships Move Erraticly in the Waters of Zhenhai and Qushan

Changtu Island, which belongs to Dinghai County in Eastern Zhejiang, was previously occupied by Japanese soldiers who landed on January 11th of last year and began to withdraw in March. On the morning of the 27th of last month, two medium-sized Japanese warships sailed from Daishan and anchored off Niangjigong and Woweitou in Changtu Port. Subsequently, many soldiers poured ashore. Later, more than forty Japanese soldiers landed at the Zhengyi Temple on Shengdou Mountain in Niangjigong and searched the villages and towns in the upper and lower streets. They returned to their ships at night. One day, a Japanese warship arrived in the waters of Lindashan near Chuanshan in Zhenhai and sailed elsewhere the day before yesterday. Although Japanese warships have been patrolling in the waters of Qushan, they have not landed and the entire mountain is peaceful.

### Over Ten Thousand Jewish Refugees, Over 400 Arrived on an Italian Ship and Have Been Placed Separately

The North-China Daily News reports that 465 German and Austrian Jewish refugees arrived here yesterday (the 4th) afternoon on the Italian mail ship Conte Verde, increasing the number of Jewish refugees residing in the city. Staff from the local committee caring for Jewish refugees were at the Kung Wo Wharf to assist those who disembarked, then sent them to various shelters. Most were placed in the shelter on Jingzhou Road, while others were sent to shelters on Huade Road, Zhaofeng Road, Huishan Road and the Riverine Apartments. It is estimated that the total number of Jewish refugees currently in Shanghai has reached 10,500. It is expected that another 9,000 will arrive in Shanghai this year.

### Comparison of Merchant Ships Coming and Going to Various Customs, Shanghai Leads All Customs, Tianjin and Jiaozhou Follow

The Customs released a comparison of merchant ships coming and going to various customs from January to April. Shanghai had 1,128 ships with 4,952,573 tons, Tianjin had 1,382 ships with 1,010,695 tons, Jiaozhou had 525 ships with 948,206 tons, Shantou had 552 ships with 826,912 tons, Qinhuangdao had 309 ships with 803,879 tons, Yantai had 482 ships with 256,171 tons, and Leizhou had 21,634 ships with 201,608 tons.

### Order from the Central Executive Committee: Prohibition of Factional Cliques, Concentration of Efforts to Jointly Relieve National Crisis, Intensified Supervision and Constant Restraint

The National Government's Central Executive Committee, in order to ensure coordinated action and eliminate factional cliques to concentrate efforts, has previously issued an order through the President to all levels to strictly comply and work together to overcome difficulties. However, reports indicate that some regions still have small cliques engaging in individual activities, which is highly inappropriate. Therefore, the Executive Committee reiterates its order, urging all to consider the current hardships, concentrate efforts, be of one mind and one heart, and jointly relieve the national crisis. Those who persist in their prejudices and outwardly comply but inwardly defy will be severely punished without leniency once discovered. Those responsible for supervision should especially exercise constant restraint. If such incidents are discovered again, they should be reported immediately without any favoritism. The aim is to eliminate all divisions and fulfill the President's earnest instructions.

### Commodity Exhibition: Closed Yesterday, Compilation of National Product Survey Statistics for Distribution to Southeast Asia to Promote Export Sales

The China National Products Manufacturers Association held a commodity exhibition at the Shanghai New World on Jing'an Temple Road, showcasing over ten thousand kinds of domestic goods. The exhibition was open to the public, providing citizens with an opportunity to identify domestic products and received high praise from all sectors. With the three-week exhibition period now over, it was officially closed yesterday. The association has sent a special letter to all participating manufacturers, instructing them to reclaim their exhibited goods within one week upon presentation of receipts. The manufacturers who have been approved by the review committee for awards will be notified separately for the distribution of certificates. The association previously received requests from various chambers of commerce in Southeast Asia, seeking information on the production of Shanghai domestic goods. In addition to dispatching personnel to conduct on-site investigations at member manufacturers, the association also took advantage of this exhibition to compile detailed survey statistics on Shanghai domestic goods, including factory names, product names, production volume, producers, trademarks, and other items, which will be sent to Southeast Asia for reference, thereby promoting the export of domestic goods.

### Ningbo-Fenghua Highway: Completely Cut Off, Ningbo Court Prisoners Safely Relocated

After the Yushan to Xikou section of the Jiangkou East section of the Ningbo-Fenghua New Highway was destroyed last month under the provincial order, it is now known that the authorities, in order to consolidate the rear defense and stabilize public morale, have also thoroughly destroyed the Jiangkou-Fengcheng section of the highway by commencing excavation work. All bridges have been separately blown up. The destruction of the said highway section has now been completed.

Prisoners Safely Relocated

The Ningbo County District Court Detention Center, which detains various prisoners, has received a joint petition from the prisoners through the warden requesting safe relocation due to the continuous bombing of the city. Considering that the detainees have not yet been convicted and bear no certain guilt, the court president has ordered the release of those with minor offenses on bail to avoid unnecessary sacrifice. The remaining prisoners have been transferred to another location for temporary detention.

Cold Storage Completely Destroyed

Ningbo was subjected to the ninth bombing by Japanese aircraft on the morning of the 3rd, with bombs landing on Dadaotou, Dongdu Road, Fangjing Road, Tangjie, and the Lingqiao vegetable market. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the Wangjiang Street Cold Storage Company, which had been bombed once before, was bombed again. This cold storage was a leading enterprise in the first district of Ningbo, and its destruction is deeply regrettable.

### Copper Coin Shortage in the Market, Japanese Collecting Scrap Iron, Over 10,000 Tons Accumulated, Soon to be Shipped to Japan, Thuggish Lackeys Still Searching Everywhere

Although the financial situation in the city has remained stable due to the National Government's sufficient preparation despite the prolonged war, a shortage of copper coins has suddenly emerged in the market. This phenomenon appeared a week ago, and now exchange locations are also affected, making it difficult to operate and hindering circulation. Even transportation vehicles, which usually have an abundance of copper coins, are experiencing panic. This indicates that someone is manipulating the supply of copper coins in the city, or even secretly hoarding them, leading to a sudden and sharp reduction. It is hoped that the city's silver and money industries will pay close attention to this and act with utmost integrity to maintain the people's livelihood. At the same time, it has been learned that the Japanese puppets have been collecting scrap copper and iron in the Jiangnan war zone in recent months and hoarding it in Shanghai. There are warehouses near a puppet-run fish market on Qiwupu Road, with a total of over 10,000 tons accumulated, ready to be shipped to Japan in batches. Furthermore, purchasing points are secretly scattered everywhere, and thuggish lackeys are enticing ignorant residents with high prices to sell their old iron tools, leading to an increasing scarcity of old copper and scrap iron.

### Dedicated to Men and Women Grieving Lost Love or Marital Discord

Love: Some say it is a mystery, some say it is strength, and even some hypocritical scholars say it is a sin. What is it really? I believe that everyone, both men and women, understands it very well in their hearts. According to Spencer's analysis, a person's life mainly consists of economic life and sexual life, with social and moral life being secondary. The saying "Only when one is well-fed and warmly clothed does one think of lustful desires" and "Knowing honor and shame only comes after the granary is full" are both based on factual assertions. To put it bluntly, love arises from the need for sexual life. Sexuality is an innate instinct, present from birth, and fully expressed in adulthood. Physiological research shows that there is a specific organ in our body responsible for reproduction, namely the gonads. This organ is responsible for the development of the body's appearance and weight in childhood and specializes in reproductive work after adulthood. Therefore, if this gland is healthy, the body will naturally be strong, and the intelligence will naturally be agile. The head will be clear, and the energy will be abundant. This is not only welcomed by women, but also allows one to be successful in love, and to choose the most satisfactory partner. Even after marriage, the love between husband and wife will be deep, and raising children will lead to a happy family. If young people do not cherish themselves, and engage in self-gratification, nocturnal emissions, or early marriage and excessive indulgence, or frequent flower shops and unrestrained debauchery, the reproductive function will be damaged. It may also be due to hereditary factors, or post-illness disorders, that the reproductive function is weakened. In that case, symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin semen, infertility, and neurasthenia are inevitable. Indeed, a man like this is often abandoned by the opposite sex because of his unattractive appearance. The pain of lost love is self-inflicted. Why should he blame the other party? Even after marriage, marital life will not be happy, leading to henpecked husbands or marital discord, and family tragedies. This is also mostly the man's own fault. Therefore, a smart man must reflect on himself, and if it is due to physical weakness, he should quickly seek effective remedies, which will undoubtedly remove the disadvantages and bring good fortune.

What is an effective remedy? It is necessary to use gonadal endocrine therapy, that is, to quickly take the gonadal preparation "Germinal Essence", which is the most effective treatment. This agent is extracted from the gonads of strong animals such as chimpanzees, deer, and sea dogs, and replicated using scientific methods. The precious nourishing substances are completely preserved and abundant. According to Dr. Millmiling, a famous German physician, who compared this agent with other similar preparations, it not only proves that its quality is always five to ten times higher than other similar preparations, but the number of cured cases is also about thirty times higher. Because this agent can produce sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, nourish the nerves, and promote developmental function within one day and night after taking it, and can invigorate metabolism. If you continue to take it, it will fundamentally cure the above symptoms in the short term, and make the body healthier and extend life. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Hemetol Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" (available in Sino-British, Sino-French, Hua-English and other pharmacies) to consolidate the sperm and stop the leakage, so that both the root and the branch can be treated, and the effect will be faster.

### The Failure and Success of Spermatorrhea Treatment

— Zhan Nianceng, VD Specialist

Many young people have ruined their future because of the failure of spermatorrhea treatment. This is indeed due to the patient's lack of determination or common sense, but the medical profession should also bear considerable responsibility. The reason why young people have spermatorrhea is mostly because of committing self-gratification and indulgence, which damages the sexual nerves. When the sexual nerves are weakened or become hypersensitive, the spermatic duct often loses its control, and spermatorrhea arises from this. Knowing this, to treat spermatorrhea, we must start by consolidating the spermatic duct and nourishing and calming the nerves. "Hemetol Sperm-Consolidating Tablets," secretly made by Dr. Hemetol of Germany, fully possess this function. Therefore, all those who can use this medicine will undoubtedly receive the effect of medicine arriving and the disease being removed. If you take other miscellaneous brands such as spermatorrhea tablets, because the function is weak, it often leads to failure in treatment. If spermatorrhea treatment fails or is delayed, the so-called "a small leak will sink a great ship." The symptoms will inevitably worsen, or even lead to exhaustion of sperm and blood, and all kinds of diseases will arise. Symptoms such as weakness, forgetfulness and insomnia, back pain, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and infertility will occur one after another. This kind of young people not only cannot study and work, and their future is bleak, but also cannot have a happy marital life, and the family will often fall into tragedy, or have no children, premature aging, and early death! Therefore, early and thorough cure of spermatorrhea is a very urgent need for patients. Dr. Lin of Germany once praised "Hemetol Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" as the only savior for young people with spermatorrhea. If spermatorrhea has already caused the above symptoms, you must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Essence" to nourish the brain and kidneys, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it, you will be able to restore perfect health soon. If patients come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by expert doctors, and then use electrotherapy and injections, we can guarantee a cure.

Beauty

### The Threat and Rescue of Breast Atrophy

— Yao Chongpei, MD, USA

Facing the mirror under the gauze window, applying rouge and powder, and putting on makeup, suddenly seeing shriveled breasts while changing clothes, breaking one's heart and sighing alone! No matter what mistake or defect, if no one points it out, or if you have not thought of it yourself, you don't feel anything. Once someone points it out, and you think about it carefully, you feel uglier and more uneasy. For example, a woman with shriveled breasts, when she gets up in the morning and faces the mirror, applying rouge and powder, she never thought she was not beautiful. She looks left and right, and is very proud. But when she takes her clothes to change, and sees the ugly state of her shriveled breasts, she will suddenly cool down from the previous proud look on her face. She even breaks her heart, sighs, and hates for no reason!

However, what is said here is just her own sigh. If someone else gives her a sarcastic remark, her inner pain will be even worse! Therefore, there cannot be defects on a person's body. If there are defects, they should be actively remedied. For example, for women with shriveled breasts, thin buttocks, and loss of beauty, the main reason is the weakness of ovarian function, which affects metabolism. The most effective and reliable method is to take the gonadal ovarian endocrine preparation "Germinal Essence" for women. This agent has high-quality ingredients and is carefully prepared. It has been proven by famous doctors in various countries around the world, and is considered to have peaceful medicinal properties and great effects. After taking it for one day and night, it can nourish ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop leucorrhea. If you continue to take it, it can not only make the shriveled breasts gradually become erect, but also make the thin buttocks gradually become plump, enhance the love between husband and wife, promote pregnancy function, strengthen the body and maintain beauty. It is truly the only holy medicine for modern women.

### What is the Secret to Curing Gonorrhea?

Recently, the promotion of gonorrhea treatment by general physicians in the market seems to be only one kind, and this kind of promotion focuses on the treatment aspect. But to fundamentally solve gonorrhea, the following three conditions must be met:

(1) The doctor's own knowledge and experience!

(2) The equipment should be meticulous and should be developed with the times!

(3) The patient should trust reputable and responsible experts!

If the above three conditions can be met, there is no need to worry about solving any gonorrhea. First of all, if the doctor has rich medical knowledge and rich clinical experience, and has a brand-new mind, he will not be confined by many years of clinical experience. Otherwise, the more experience he has, the older his mind will be, and he will refuse to absorb new knowledge and become a laggard of the times. This kind of doctor is not worth much. The second condition is the equipment aspect. Now that science is advancing rapidly, the equipment for gonorrhea treatment should be the most advanced medical equipment. In this regard, I often inspect the new equipment in major hospitals in Europe and the United States, and purchase the latest medical equipment every year. For example, microscopes, cystoscopes and other medical equipment must be replaced every year to promote the effectiveness of diagnosis. The third condition is that patients should trust and not change their minds about doctors who are responsible and reputable. If you can follow the above, gonorrhea can be absolutely cured. This is the secret to curing gonorrhea. For those suffering from acute and chronic gonorrhea, such as prostatitis, cystitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, orchitis, arthritis, etc., in addition to using the latest medical equipment for detailed examination and diagnosis, you must also have German Filt淋平流电疗法 (German Filt Lymph Smooth Flow Electrotherapy), German Xi's Serum, cold electrotherapy, various types of 菩齐 (Pu Qi), homemade vaccines, etc., which can be used according to the symptoms. In as little as two weeks and as much as five weeks, you can cure ten out of ten.

### Smuggling Fake Cigarettes, Tout Arrested Four Times, Investigation of Counterfeiting Accomplices

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, there have been many abnormally developed businesses, and cigarettes are one of them. General emerging large-scale cigarette companies take advantage of this opportunity to easily evade taxes and the urgent need in the occupied areas to produce crude and substandard products, and even arbitrarily imitate the brand names and trademarks of famous cigarettes, caring only for profit and disregarding reputation. Therefore, recently

counterfeiting and selling

cases of counterfeit cigarettes have been cracked more frequently. Now there is another tout, Fan Shaobo from Ningbo, who specializes in selling counterfeit cigarettes, who has been arrested by Chinese detective Zhao Zigan of the Hongkou Police Station. The suspect has been engaged in this business and has been arrested and punished by the court, but he still did not repent. Last month, he sold five large boxes of counterfeit cigarettes imitating a certain foreign company's product to Dongbao Foreign Firm, opened by a Korean, at 360 Tiantong Road for

法币 (legal tender) 1,000 yuan.

Later, the firm transported them to the occupied area and sold them to the Japanese army, who then realized they were of poor quality. The owner of Dongbao reported to the police station and requested an investigation. A few days ago, Fan came to the firm again to tout counterfeit goods, and the owner managed to stall him while secretly reporting to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Detective Zhao and Western detectives to rush there.

arrested on the spot

The next morning, he was sent to the First Special District District Court for trial. According to Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the police station, the counterfeit cigarettes sold by the suspect need to be identified by the original company that produced them, and the counterfeiting accomplices need to be investigated. Therefore, he requested an extension. Judge Zhong interrogated Fan Shaobo and ordered him to be detained for further questioning at a later date.

### Accused Admits to Strangling Paramour, Sentencing Next Monday

Li Jingen, a carpenter from Suzhou who worked at the Zhonghua Woodware Shop at 847 Qiwupu Road, Aoshuipu, had a relationship with Gu Xiaomei, a woman from Changzhou in her teens, before the Battle of Shanghai. Due to the outbreak of the war and the fact that their residence was in the war zone, they each went their own way and separated. In April of this year, Li and Gu suddenly met again on Qiwupu Road,

reunited after a long separation

and became especially intimate. They both agreed to rekindle their old relationship and cohabitate again. They rented a room in the kitchen in Lane 130, No. 23 Jining Road. Unexpectedly, during their cohabitation, Li suddenly discovered that Gu Xiaomei had another lover and was once caught by Li. Consumed by jealousy, the desire to kill arose in his mind. In the middle of the night on the 20th of last month, Li, taking advantage of Gu Xiaomei's deep sleep, suddenly put a rope around Gu's neck and tightened it forcefully,

instantly strangling her to death.

After the incident, he dug a hole in the floor of the bedroom and buried the body, intending to cover up the crime. This was discovered by Peng Zhenxuan, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, who arrested Li and exhumed the body. The Special Court examined the body and sent it to the Pushan Villa for burial, and sent Li to the First Special Court to be prosecuted for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. A confession has already been taken,

and the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin presided over the second hearing in the Second Criminal Court. According to the landlady, Mrs. Li Jin, who came to report, she rented the kitchen to the defendant and the deceased for only forty days at a monthly rent of three yuan. However, she was completely unaware of the defendant's act of strangling Gu Xiaomei and burying the body, and had never heard them

arguing

on weekdays. Subsequently, witnesses Wang Songda, the owner of the Zhonghua Woodware Shop, and A-Quan and Hai-Quan, etc., testified. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he killed Gu by strangling her with a rope because of her infidelity. After mutual arguments between Jiang Baolian, a lawyer from the police station, and Xuan Zhendong, an assigned lawyer, the court ended the debate and ordered the defendant to be detained pending sentencing next Monday.

### French Police Department Urges Citizens to Respect Traffic Regulations; Following the Public Concession's Safety Campaign; More Officers Added at Busy Intersections to Correct Pedestrians

Following the launch of a safety campaign by the Public Concession to reduce traffic accidents and protect citizen safety, the French Concession Police Department has also launched a similar campaign. In addition to distributing large numbers of leaflets and slogans, they have also added officers at busy intersections to dissuade pedestrians from jaywalking. The details are as follows:

Admonishment to Respect Traffic Regulations

The French Concession Police Department has issued a concise public notice to reduce traffic accidents. The original text states that the population of the French Concession has increased significantly in recent years, and the number of cars, rickshaws, small carts, and pedestrians on the roads has also increased, unfortunately leading to a continuous increase in traffic accidents. In 1938, 48 people died and 1,555 were injured in traffic accidents. The number of accidents must be reduced. The only way to do this is for pedestrians, rickshaw pullers, small cart drivers, car passengers, and car drivers to firmly respect traffic regulations and obey the orders of traffic police. It is better to drive or walk more slowly than to be the cause or victim of an accident.

Distributing Large Numbers of Slogans and Leaflets

In order to expand the safety campaign's publicity, the Police Department has printed a large number of slogans and leaflets, which are being distributed by police officers to promote public awareness and reduce accidents. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Walk on the sidewalks. (2) Cross the street near intersections, and only when traffic is blocked by traffic police. (3) Before crossing the street, look left and right for oncoming vehicles. (4) When crossing the street with children, hold their hands firmly. (5) Do not run when crossing the street. (6) Wait for streetcars on the sidewalk, and only step forward when the streetcar has stopped. (Remember) (1) Pedestrians are often victims of traffic accidents. (2) Careless pedestrians are the cause of traffic accidents, or cause harm to others.

Adding Officers to Correct Pedestrians

A Chinese officer of the Police Department stated that citizens often like to walk in the middle of the road instead of on the sidewalks, leading to congestion and increasing the risk of accidents. In view of this, the French Police Department posted white cloth banners along Avenue Joffre and Avenue Dubail in February of this year, boldly stating "Please walk on the sidewalk, do not walk in the middle of the road." However, most citizens still do not comply. In order to effectively implement this, the Police Department has added more officers to Avenue Joffre and intersections to correct pedestrians. In addition to stopping them from crossing the street when the light is red, they are also advising them to walk on the sidewalks. Those who stubbornly refuse will be forced to comply.

### Son Disobedient and Violent; Destroys Shoe Workshop; Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment

Wang Zaizhou, the evildoer, runs a shoe workshop at No. 4, Lane 309, Park Road. His wife, Yang, his 19-year-old son, Wang Wenzheng, and his daughter-in-law, Wu, all live and work in the workshop. It was originally a harmonious family living by their craft. Unexpectedly, his son Wenzheng's nature is beastly. He does not obey instructions and disregards money. Recently, he has become even more extreme. The other day, because his parents could not satisfy his desires, he became enraged and, wielding a stick, destroyed all the objects and tools in the workshop. His white-haired parents and young wife were powerless to stop his violent actions. Afterwards, an employee, Liu Fuhou, reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched Detective Wang Shidong and a Western detective to the scene. They arrested the assailant and took him, along with the weapon, to the police station. Yesterday, he was brought before Judge Zhong of the First Special District Court.

### Modern Girl Dies From Poisoning This Morning; Still Made a Date to Meet Her Lover After Taking Poison; Sent to Hospital After Discovery but Treatment Was Ineffective

Ai Lizhu, a girl from Huzhou, 20 years old, with a slender figure and fashionable clothes, lived at No. 339 Shanxi Road. Ai was fond of dancing and often frequented major dance halls in her spare time. She had a boyfriend, Zhang, who lived at a certain address on Avenue Ghisi. He was a college student, young and handsome, a fine young man. He and Ai had a close relationship and their affection was unwavering. At around 10:30 PM last night, Ai left a dance hall and went to a public telephone near Avenue Sainte Marie to call Zhang, asking him to come to meet her. Soon after, Zhang arrived and they whispered sweet nothings. However, Zhang vaguely smelled an unusual odor emanating from Ai's mouth. He questioned her, and she revealed the truth. She said that she had bought two bottles of a certain poisonous liquid and had already swallowed one bottle, leaving the other bottle in her room at home. As she spoke, tears rolled down her cheeks, and she expressed a desire to end her life. Zhang was shocked by this news and at a loss. He quickly called for a car and accompanied her to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, the poison had already taken effect and treatment was ineffective. She tragically passed away at 0:30 AM this morning. The hospital reported to the police, who dispatched detectives to the scene and detained Zhang. They also notified the girl's family to come.

The Faber Cup yesterday: The Songlian team won against the Hengchang team (Group B, Level A) with a score of 4-2; The Pharmacy team won against the Postal Service team (Group B, Level D) with a score of 2-0. (Official announcement from the association). Today, due to the inspection of the French Army Commander, the original two matches have been postponed. Bad news from Chongqing: Pole vault champion Fu Baolu has died in action, sacrificing his life for the country in an aerial battle with Japanese planes in Guilin.

本月三日中西運動會舉行時、華聯運動員張嘉夔傳出消息、謂有一友人、有函自方岩寄滬云、中國撑竿跳大王符保盧、在桂林參加空戰、業已殉國、其父耀亭君聞訊後、疑信參半、因符君於二週前、尚有函寄家屬、然已悲痛至極、昨茲得海通社重慶五日電云「據此間所接消息、中國運動名將、一九三六年代表中國、參加柏林世界運動會撑竽跳之選手符保盧、最近在桂林與日機空戰、已爲國捐軀、英勇殉難、按符係東三省人、中日戰事爆發後、即投效空軍、任駕駛員」、由此觀之、符君之殉難、巳有多方傳來消息矣、查符君自東三省被佔後、於民國二十三年即由哈爾濱來滬、歷獲全運會撑竿跳冠軍、出席柏林世運、榮獲第二名、爲國爭光、無不欽佩、厥後在滬研究修理飛機、並習駕駛、戰事發生後、先至漢口、繼赴昆明、駕駛技術巳精、並担任訓練航空員、今不幸惡耗頻傳矣、
On the 3rd of this month, during the Sino-Western Games, Hualian athlete Zhang Jiakui reported that a friend had sent a letter from Fangyan to Shanghai, stating that Fu Baolu, the "Pole Vault King" of China, had died in action in an aerial battle in Guilin. After hearing the news, his father, Mr. Yaoting, was doubtful, as Mr. Fu had sent a letter to his family only two weeks prior, but he was already extremely saddened. Yesterday, a dispatch from the Haitong News Agency in Chongqing on the 5th stated, "According to news received here, Fu Baolu, a famous Chinese athlete who represented China in the pole vault at the 1936 Berlin World Games, recently died in action in an aerial battle with Japanese planes in Guilin, sacrificing his life heroically. Fu was from the three northeastern provinces and joined the air force after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, serving as a pilot." From this, it can be seen that news of Mr. Fu's death has come from various sources. It is known that after the three northeastern provinces were occupied, Mr. Fu came to Shanghai from Harbin in 1934, winning the pole vault championship at the National Games several times. He attended the Berlin World Games, winning second place and bringing glory to the country, for which everyone admired him. Later, he studied and repaired airplanes in Shanghai and learned to fly. After the outbreak of war, he first went to Hankou, then to Kunming, where his flying skills became excellent. He also served as an aviation instructor. Now, unfortunately, bad news has come frequently.

Yesterday's black market for spot gold initially fell below 2,100 yuan, due to weak buying interest from merchant groups and a sudden selling trend from Tianjin businesses. As a result, many speculative investors rushed to sell, and banks also competed to dump their holdings, causing a glut of chips in the market. The price fell to a low of 2,094 yuan at closing, a drop of seven yuan. Market sentiment was weak, and trading was slow, with only over 500 taels changing hands throughout the day. Gold jewelry prices in jewelry stores remained unchanged, and Customs Gold and Sino-British pure gold prices remained the same.

From the morning, sellers such as cash shops initially quoted 2,102 yuan per "tiao" (10 taels), but due to low buying interest from merchant groups, the price gradually lowered. At the 9:50 AM opening, the price was already one yuan lower than the previous weekend. A cash shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange business for 2,100 yuan, and jewelry businesses traded 50 taels among themselves at the same price. At that time, due to weak buying interest, individual investors and jewelry businesses competed to sell, causing the market to weaken further. The price suddenly dropped by three yuan. A spot gold shop, acting on behalf of individual investors, sold 50 taels to a money exchange business for 97 yuan. Jewelry businesses and the De Fu securities business successively sold a total of 100 taels to a money exchange business at the same price. Soon after, jewelry businesses sold another 100 taels to a gold shop (acting on behalf of a South China business) at 96 yuan each. Later, the money exchange business came back to buy, and the market price gradually increased. The money exchange business bought 20 taels from fellow businesses and 50 taels from jewelry businesses, both at 97 yuan each. Later, they bought another 50 taels from fellow businesses at 98 yuan, which became the midday closing price. In the afternoon, due to renewed selling interest from the De Fu securities business and hesitant buyers, the market trended downwards again. However, there were no transactions for a long time. It was not until after 3:30 PM that the De Fu securities business sold 50 taels to a money exchange business, with the price falling by four yuan compared to the midday closing price, to 94 yuan. There were no further transactions until the evening closing, so the closing price remained at 2,094 yuan, a drop of seven yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The price fluctuated by only six yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash shops' own brands was 2,100 yuan, and the buying price was 2,090 yuan. The current premium was 50 yuan lower than the advertised premium, and there was a market but no trading.

As a result, spot and forward prices remained stagnant. Transactions were mostly between Chinese and foreign banks. There was little activity in the Hong Kong exchange rate, which ultimately remained flat.

In the early morning, the London long-term rate narrowed by 0.0625 for near, medium, and long terms. New York silver prices remained fixed, and London raw gold remained flat. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai currency, and French francs were all flat.

The price remained at 8 pence and 25. Subsequently, the Overseas Chinese Bank sold spot US dollars to fellow banks at 16.09375 yuan, so the situation was unchanged.

Later, the foreign bank Holland slightly sold spot Hong Kong dollars to a money exchange business, with the price still at 55.25 yuan. The situation was also flat. Until the evening closing, the spot selling prices for British pounds, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars at banks were: 8 pence and 25 for British pounds, 16.09375 yuan for US dollars, and 55.25 yuan for Hong Kong dollars. As a result, compared to the midday closing on the previous weekend, there were no gains or losses for British pounds, US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, or Japanese currency.

On the previous Saturday, British pure gold remained unchanged, and the British pound/US dollar exchange rate rose by 0.0625. Yesterday, in the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms settled accounts frequently, and foreign banks supplied smoothly, so the market price did not change. Spot gold shops and money exchange businesses supplied and sold, so the market was weak and fell by seven yuan. The demand for foreign currency British pounds and US dollars was very low, and spot gold was weak, so they all fell. The supply and demand for British pound and US dollar drafts were still strong. The demand for British pound drafts increased slightly and rose. The supply and demand for Hong Kong drafts were balanced, and the price did not change. The supply of French franc drafts was slightly higher, and the price fell back down. The demand for Annam piastres and Italian lira was high, and the price rose. Japanese gold drafts were traded at 9 jiao, 2 fen, and 7 li in the morning. The market supply was relatively smooth. Because the authorities manipulated it strictly, the decline was not severe. The result was 9 jiao, 2 fen, and 3 li. The supply and demand for Korean won was relatively low, and the market was stable. It was traded at 8 jiao, 3 fen, and 7 li in the morning, and the result was 8 jiao, 3 fen, and 5 li. There were no guild transactions. Yesterday, British pounds fell by 5 fen, British pound drafts rose by 1 fen, US dollars fell by 2 jiao, French franc drafts fell by 2.5 hao, Annam piastres and Italian lira each rose by 1 fen, and other currencies remained unchanged.

工商談助白煤加價的索隱  培本　　
Discussion on the Reasons for the Increased Price of White Coal by Peiben

在往年：白煤生意，一到了夏令，不但銷塲淸淡，就是價目因供過於求，逐步回跌，經理的行家，在這落令時期，祇求不致虧本，也很願意脫貨求現，所謂「六個月大六個月小，賺錢蝕本，是商界的常事，今歲，亂世年頭，百物昂貴，就是燃料的煤炭，也不能例外，在此落令時開，不但不見回跌，鴻某由煤却從六月一日起塊煤每噸加起三元盤子，這種反乎情理的漲價，不但外行莫明其妙，就是同業也以爲事出非常，　愣萬分。　　
In previous years, when it came to white coal business, during the summer season, not only was the market sluggish, but the prices gradually fell due to oversupply. Dealers only sought to avoid losses during this off-season and were willing to sell their goods for cash. As the saying goes, "Six months up, six months down. Making money and losing money is common in the business world." This year, in these chaotic times, everything is expensive. Even fuel coal is no exception. During this off-season, instead of seeing a decline, Hongji Coal raised the price of lump coal by three yuan per ton starting June 1st. This unreasonable price increase not only baffled outsiders, but also made fellow dealers think that something extraordinary had happened and were extremely surprised.

雖然，經理行家漲價的理由，是「水脚飛漲，成本提高」，但是：爲什慶同船來貨的鴻基屑子却又不漲呢？何況水脚的飛漲在云歲早已提高，又為什麼直待銷塲落時的夏令方纔漲價呢？這兩個謎，却是一般同業引爲令人費解的問題，可是，無風不起浪；一個果的產生，必有原因！　　
Although the reason given by dealers for the price increase was "soaring freight costs and increased costs," why didn't the price of Hongji Coal dross, which came on the same ships, also increase? Moreover, freight costs had already increased significantly this year. Why did the price increase only occur during the summer season, when the market is slow? These two mysteries are considered perplexing questions by fellow dealers. However, there is no wave without wind. The production of a result must have a cause!

（一）產地限制出口　國產白煤，本有河南，山西等礦，軍興以來，因交通阻梗，來源斷絕，本市燃料，端賴洋煤支持，白煤有法屬鴻基，海峯，馬克等貨，每年我國進口，達二十餘萬噸，足堪供應，但自去歲起，該國爲儲藏燃料，以備軍用，對於塊煤出口，巳有限制，故邇來到貨不多，求過於供，「物稀爲貴」，以致行家一再抬高價格，實基於此。　　
(1) Export Restrictions in Production Areas: Domestic white coal originally came from mines in Henan and Shanxi provinces. Since the outbreak of the war, due to transportation disruptions, the supply has been cut off. The city's fuel relies on imported coal. White coal includes goods from French-owned Hongji, Haifeng, and Mac mines. China imports more than 200,000 tons annually, which is sufficient to supply the market. However, since last year, in order to store fuel for military use, the country has restricted the export of lump coal, so there are fewer goods arriving recently. Demand exceeds supply, so "scarce goods are valuable," leading dealers to repeatedly raise prices. This is the real reason.

（二）以得償失政策　塊煤出口雖然受了限制，可是，做煤球原料的鴻基屑子，却又大批裝到，各棧堆積存貨，達兩三萬噸，以致推動不易，不得不創價傾銷，而經理行家又須填款拆息及棧租種種負担，代人作嫁，所得無幾，乃不得不取償於塊煤，以遂其「失之東隅，收之桑榆」之利益，是項傳說——亦非無因。　　
(2) "Gain from Loss" Policy: Although the export of lump coal is restricted, Hongji Coal dross, which is used as a raw material for making coal balls, is shipped in large quantities. Warehouses are piled up with 20,000 to 30,000 tons of inventory, making it difficult to promote sales. Dealers have to bear various burdens such as loan interest and warehouse rent, doing the work for others and gaining very little. Therefore, they have to recoup their losses from lump coal in order to achieve the benefit of "losing at sunrise and gaining at sunset." This rumor is not without reason.

（三）漲價不得其時　淸銷時節，突然加價，雖爲一般人引作可異，但其中實有隱情，蓋去年冬間，某行所出棧單，實超定額，倘一旦加價，不但自身難受實惠，且徒予囤戶造機會，擾亂市塲，故隱忍不發，直待最近存單出淸，方告加價，結果，囤戶不但無利可獲，抑且賠本拆息，為他人作牛馬耳，故曰，為有計劃之加價，非漲價不得其時！　　
(3) The Price Increase Was Not Timely: Suddenly raising prices during the sales season is considered strange by most people, but there are hidden reasons. Last winter, a certain dealer issued warehouse receipts that exceeded the quota. If the price had been increased then, not only would the dealer not have benefited, but it would have created opportunities for hoarders to disrupt the market. Therefore, they endured it and did not raise prices until recently when the warehouse receipts were cleared. As a result, hoarders not only did not profit, but also lost money on interest and worked for others. Therefore, it can be said that the price increase was planned and the time was not chosen arbitrarily!

結果，卻苦了一般薪水階級的平民，米珠薪桂，難乎爲生。
As a result, it is the ordinary people in the salaried class who suffer. Rice is as precious as pearls, and firewood is as expensive as cassia. It is difficult to make a living.

證券　洋商股獨具堅昂　內債由堅而回疲　　
Securities: Foreign Stocks Remain Strong, Domestic Debt Weakens

證券暗盤、咋日市况漸由盤旋趨疲、而大戶多頭因積重難返、仍在掙扎拉抬、空方待時而動、但亦並未見加碼、故市價雖疲、交易甚少、國內外均尚無明朗之象、紙以發息期近、若無鉅大事故、市價尚不致遽行有何劇變、昨日經過、初開時、因天生潤利稍有吃進、三十五號巳在出脫、市價初堅後疲、後以仁昌承康裕濟及四十九號均有賣出、二十號雖有拉抬、未能普及　戊丁堅定、餘巳略軟、午後信豐永聯和潤利申一樂茂及十一號均有賣出、雖十三及二十二號等買進、仍覺供過於求、後以二十號再行拉抬、乃得稍定、但比上午又小一二角、市價結果略小一角至三角半、成交總數共計的五十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、　　
The black market for securities gradually weakened from hovering yesterday. Large bullish investors, unable to reverse their positions, continued to struggle to push prices up. Bears waited for the right time to act, but did not increase their positions. Therefore, although market prices were weak, there were few transactions. There were no clear signs domestically or internationally. Given that the interest payment period was approaching, unless there were major incidents, market prices were not expected to change drastically. Yesterday's developments: At the opening, Tian Sheng Runli bought slightly, and No. 35 was already selling. Market prices were initially strong but then weakened. Later, Ren Chang Cheng, Kang Yuji, and No. 49 all sold. Although No. 20 tried to push prices up, it was not widespread. Wuding was firm, and the rest were slightly soft. In the afternoon, Xin Feng Yonglian, He Runli, Shen Yi Le Mao, and No. 11 all sold. Although No. 13 and No. 22 bought, the market still felt oversupplied. Later, No. 20 tried to push prices up again, which stabilized the market slightly, but it was still 1-2 jiao lower than in the morning. As a result, market prices were slightly lower, ranging from 1 jiao to 3.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was about 500,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Ye Guang Company reported that yesterday was the largest periodic settlement day in months. The market atmosphere continued to be enthusiastic and strong. Trading was most prominent in agricultural stocks and Ye Guang stocks. Agricultural stocks were widely traded. Although many large bullish investors took profits and sold, the transaction price reached 7 yuan and several jiao. The company's coal production in May reached 11,550 tons, which was satisfactory. It was also believed that interim interest would be distributed soon. Ye Guang stock prices rose sharply from 9.3 yuan to 10 yuan. The reason for this increase was not easy to understand. However, the company's current rental income has greatly increased. However, in the Hongkou area, the company holds a large portion of the property, which now seems to have developed. However, it is only a wish. The share price of International Trust was 4.9 yuan, and the share price of Yangzi Silver Company was 7.7 yuan, both stable. Sihai stock continued to rise and was traded at 8.9 yuan. There was also demand for steel stocks, which rose sharply to 6.4 yuan. Telephone stocks were slightly firm and were traded at 100 yuan (ex-dividend).

橡皮股市平靜而堅挺、見有多頭者結算其近日來之盈利、太拿馬拉股成交二元、及英楂華股價十六元七角、橡皮信託股有良好需求、堅持於四元九角五分之價、　　
The rubber stock market was calm and firm. Several bullish investors settled their recent profits. Ta Na Ma La stocks were traded at 2 yuan, and British Zha Hua stocks were priced at 16.7 yuan. There was good demand for rubber trust stocks, which held firm at a price of 4.95 yuan.

The reorganization plan of China Business Company has been approved by the US court. Despite this, the value of the company's common stock and 8% bonds continued to be contradictory. The common stock price was 2 jiao and 8 fen, with a certain amount of trading, while the 8% bonds should have been worth 74 taels, but were traded at a price of only 60 taels.

The cotton yarn market, which had been rising continuously, declined slightly yesterday. However, due to the shortage of goods, the price of 32-count single yarn continued to rise sharply. Tian Nuo reached 662 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous weekend. Samsung also followed with a 10 yuan increase. Other brands were relatively mild. However, the demand from various businesses was slightly sluggish. Due to seasonal factors, 10-count coarse yarn was being launched on the market for use by various cloth factories in manufacturing flannel fabrics. At the same time, there was also demand from Tianjin businesses in the north. Japanese factories had already phased out this type of yarn, so trading was even quieter. As for the factory's goods for August and September, they had already been pre-ordered, so the market price became easy to rise and difficult to fall. It was said that the 20-count yarn market continued to weaken in the afternoon.

現紗情形晨初開盤、市塲氣勢尚屬平靜、同業開價勿動、二十支雙馬現出價爲四百三十七元半、棧單價爲四百三十元

### This City's Graduates at All Levels; Certificate Issuance Procedures for this Year; Elementary Schools Follow Pre-War Procedures; Middle Schools Must Submit Rosters for Approval When Issuing Certificates

The procedures for issuing graduation certificates to graduates of all levels of schools in this city this year have been decided, generally following the regulations of the previous year. Elementary schools will directly issue official diplomas, temporarily suspending verification and stamping. Middle schools will issue completion certificates, and after the war is over, official graduation certificates will be exchanged, compiled, and submitted to the responsible authorities for supplementary verification and stamping. However, when issuing completion certificates, graduation rosters must first be submitted; otherwise, they will not be recognized. Universities will follow the previous procedures. The regulations for this year are detailed below: For elementary schools, each school will compile the academic records of students in school over the years. After passing a rigorous examination, they will be permitted to issue official diplomas temporarily. After the educational administrative authorities resume their duties, the schools will collect the diplomas and submit them in bulk for supplementary stamping. For middle schools, the entrance examinations will be temporarily suspended. Each school will compile the academic records of students in school over the years. After passing a rigorous examination, they will be temporarily permitted to issue completion certificates. At the same time, graduation rosters should be prepared and submitted level by level to the Ministry of Education for record-keeping. The graduation roster should include the student's name, gender, age, place of origin, past academic qualifications, grades in major subjects (i.e., entrance examination subjects), conduct grades, physical education grades, and overall average grade. After the war is over, based on the roster filed with the Ministry, official graduation certificates will be filled out, compiled, and submitted to the responsible authorities for supplementary verification and stamping before being exchanged. Colleges and universities will follow the pre-war procedures for reporting graduates, preparing rosters, and submitting them to the Ministry of Education for record-keeping. Graduation certificates must still be submitted to the Ministry. The format for the graduation certificates temporarily issued by middle schools will be standardized and printed and sold by Zhengzhong Book Company. The above procedures apply to public and private schools at all levels that have been registered. The diplomas of graduates from unregistered private schools will still not be recognized according to law.

### How to Be a Primary School Teacher in the New Era – In Commemoration of the 28th Teachers' Day – Lu Guanliu

The giant wheel of time advances unceasingly. In this decade of the 1940s in the twentieth century, not to mention the turbulent world situation, our nation and society have reached a critical juncture of survival. Since we who are engaged in education cannot transcend the real society in which we live, how exactly should we act to keep up with the times and fulfill our due mission? I believe we must have at least the following six qualities:

First, we must be able to recognize the trends of the times. Primary school teachers serve in real society and must guide children to adapt to the future society and become the backbone of that society. Therefore, in addition to guiding children to deal with daily life problems, we must also be able to teach them to understand the reality of current society and the trends of the future. To achieve this, teachers themselves must first have a clear understanding and a firm grasp of these things. Only when we have understanding ourselves will we not waver or doubt, and only then can we work actively.

Second, we must establish a noble character. Primary school teachers are role models for children and beacons of society. Even in this complex urban environment filled with evil forces that can tempt and threaten us at any time, we must be able to uphold justice and stand firm. We must have an attitude that is unyielding to force and incorruptible by wealth in order to set an example for students and lead the people.

Third, we must be enthusiastic about education. Education is the career of primary school teachers themselves. If we lack interest in teaching, we will certainly not have good results. We must recognize that these innocent children are the future pillars of the country and the beloved children of many parents. Their futures are in our hands. We must not neglect our responsibilities because of the busyness of work or the smallness of our salaries. Teaching is a spiritual undertaking, and spiritual rewards cannot be matched by any material price.

Fourth, we must pay attention to personal development. Primary school teachers must have a broad foundation of culture and rich knowledge of current affairs, so we must pay attention to development at all times and in all places. In addition to reading books and newspapers, we can also take courses to improve our skills in various specialized subjects. However, this is still knowledge from books. In addition, we must work to develop our temperament and thoughts so that we not only have rich knowledge and appropriate skills but also a kind temperament and progressive thinking to deal with things with ease and gain the trust of children.

Fifth, we must participate in group activities. Humans are social animals, and no one can live alone and survive independently. Especially in this day and age, we must pay attention to solidarity and organization. We must correct our reclusive habits and participate in group life. In a group, not only can we train our collective spirit and develop cooperative undertakings, but we can also get great help for our own development and entertainment.

Sixth, we must work hard in social work.

Primary school teachers are not only educational workers but also responsible for reforming society. There are many activities outside of school, and we can choose those that are necessary or closely related to social education to participate in and express our opinions in order to lead the general public. Furthermore, there are many real-world teaching materials in society that can also be used as references for teaching.

The above six points are the basic qualities that primary school teachers in the new era must have. If we can follow them and implement them effectively, we will not fail the mission that this great era has given us.

Dear primary school teachers, let us all cheer up and work hard to move forward on the path of light!

### Shanghai Municipal Council Scholarship for Needy Students; Registration and Examination Deadline

The Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has established a scholarship fund for needy students at the Chinese Children's Middle School and Girls' Middle School.

### Donghua Football Star Feng Yunyou Injured in Bombing in Chongqing

Feng Yunyou, a core member of the Donghua football team in this city, originally worked at the Central Mint in this city. After the outbreak of the war, he moved west with the factory and settled in Chongqing. Recently, Chongqing has suffered three extremely violent air raids, with nearly ten thousand casualties. Feng was also seriously injured during that time. Friends of Feng in this city have received airmail from Chongqing, learning the truth about Feng's injury. It is said that when the air raid occurred, Feng went to an underground air-raid shelter to hide and nothing unexpected happened. However, because the alarm was not lifted for a long time, and the air-raid shelter was crowded and the air was too turbid, Feng went to the exit in the hope of breathing fresh air.
