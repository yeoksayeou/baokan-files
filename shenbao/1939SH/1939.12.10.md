### Japanese Army Finds It Extremely Difficult to Deal with Foreign Nationals - Talk by Tada

Beiping: Lieutenant General Tada Hayao, commander of the Japanese garrison in Beiping, told reporters yesterday that "Japan is currently not worried about the redification of Northwest China; Japan's main problem is only dealing with China." Tada commented on foreigners' "suspicions that Japan intends to expel foreigners in China," and said, "We have never encountered such difficulties in dealing with foreigners in China as we do today during wartime. There is virtually no precedent in the history of the army." Tada asked foreigners to abandon their suspicions of Japan and told them to rest assured, saying that if Japan wanted to expel third-country people in China, Japan "will do it openly." Tada claimed that the British Concession in Tianjin "is no longer a base for anti-Japanese economic and political activities," but he stated that this cannot be interpreted as Japan will lift the blockade of the British and French concessions, "when the British and Japanese truly feel the need for cooperation and realize their mutual interests, the Tianjin issue can be fully resolved."

Editorial

### The Soviet-Finnish War and the League of Nations

The outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War has taken the world by surprise, and everyone is paying close attention to it. International sentiment expresses deep sympathy for Finland and does not readily forgive the Soviet Union. Although the war has only been going on for ten days and Finland's resistance is extremely heroic, Finland's future is undeniably bleak, and the assistance from various countries is very slim. According to various sources, countries have already provided assistance to Finland separately; however, the spokesperson of the Finnish government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the following lament: "The Finnish people are now asking, what will the world do for Finland? All parties have given sympathy, but what we need is not only sympathy. If no one comes to help Finland, how can this small country of three million people forever resist the Soviet Union of 180 million people? I am afraid that Finland will perish, with the same fate as Poland, or even worse. Therefore, lip service from various countries is of no help." From these few words, we can know the urgency of Finland's expectation of practical assistance. At present, the Finnish government has appealed this issue to the League of Nations, and the current League of Nations meeting will also take the Finnish issue as the theme of review; however, the League of Nations, such a ceremonial sacrificial organization, has always acted like Lao Tzu said "hesitating as if crossing a river in winter, as if fearing the neighbors"; this time regarding the Finnish issue, Finland has the right to appeal, and the League of Nations also has the obligation to accept the appeal; however, the facts show that the League of Nations' discussion of the Finnish issue, in addition to the so-called moral comfort, must still be limited.

The significance of helping Finland is not just to sanction the Soviet Union; and the reason why countries cannot actively help Finland is definitely not a lack of sympathy, but because sanctions against the Soviet Union are difficult to implement. Since the Soviet Union used troops against Finland, the opinions of various parties towards the Soviet Union are the same in condemnation, but differ in firmness. On the Soviet side, although it is publicized that it is aware of the existence of the world's anti-Soviet movement, it has no choice but to preemptively attack Finland; although this shows how the Soviet Union is worried about the international community, the international community will not accept this kind of propaganda, and will not recognize this kind of excuse, so it is not afraid of being suspected of brewing an anti-Soviet movement, and still gives Finland the greatest sympathy. Empty sympathy is not enough, small and sporadic assistance is not enough, and practical and effective assistance is currently impossible; therefore, the factual problem lies in whether the Finnish government itself can support the war situation. If it can support it for a long time, the assistance of various countries to Finland may become active; otherwise, it will inevitably encounter a tragic fate!

After the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War, the Chinese government certainly has no need to explain its position, but the Chinese people have expressed infinite concern. Because if the Soviet Union has indeed expressed itself as an unlimited raider on the Finnish issue, will it "bury the fox and then dig it up," turning around and dismantling China's war of resistance? Or if the Soviet Union has something to do in the West, will it compromise with the invaders in the East for its own interests? These two points can be said to be common questions of every Chinese person after the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War. However, the expression of the facts, the above two points, may all be overthinking. The Soviet Union's friendship with China has always shown no signs of diminishing, and the recent completion of the Sino-Soviet airline within a week is just enough to symbolize the consolidation of friendship. As for the issue of Soviet-Japanese compromise, although Tokyo has repeatedly publicized it, but observing the fundamentals of Japan's national system and national thinking, it is not suitable to emulate Germany, what great changes are there. From the Soviet Union's point of view, when the Soviet Union advanced into Poland before, it had first concluded the Nomonhan truce agreement with Japan; this time, there was something to do in Finland, but there was no such prior action, and China and Finland are not in the same category, and East Asia and Northern Europe cannot be compared, so the Soviet Union, for the sake of its own future interests, will never sell friends to raise tigers. As for the position of an ordinary bystander, one cannot help but feel an almost intolerable emotional impulse from a sense of justice towards the Soviet-Finnish issue, but "resisting the war is the most important," "I am only concerned with myself," I only wish that the Soviet Union and Finland can eventually get a satisfactory solution; as for the League of Nations meeting, it may not be helpful to the solution of this problem!

### Japanese Army Ambushed in Changzi, Jin: Fierce Battle Lasts All Day, Over 200 Killed; Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Begins Full-Scale General Offensive

Luoyang: The war situation in the Shangdang area of Eastern Shanxi, which has been silent for a long time, has also ushered in a triumphant song after the recent victories in Southern Shanxi. The Chinese and Japanese forces in Changzi have been in a stalemate for a long time. On the evening of the 4th, a certain Chinese unit ambushed several troops on the north and south highlands of Shizhe Town in order to lure and attack the Japanese troops in Changzi. At the same time, a small number of troops launched an attack on the Japanese army via Nanhancun (west of Changzi). The Japanese army saw that the Chinese forces were weak and fell into the trap. On the afternoon of the 5th, 700-800 Japanese infantry and cavalry attacked Shizhe (west of Changzi). The Chinese ambushed troops took the opportunity to attack from both sides, and the Chinese troops facing the Japanese army counterattacked. After a fierce battle that lasted all day, over 200 Japanese troops were killed. The surviving Japanese troops were unable to withstand the assault and retreated along the original route. (Telegram of the 9th)

Luoyang: Since the 3rd of this month, the Japanese army has invaded Zhongtiao Mountain again in the war in Southern Shanxi. After suffering heavy losses from the separate attacks by the Chinese army, the Japanese army has been in a slump. The Chinese army took advantage of the exhaustion of the Japanese army and launched a full-scale general offensive, successively recovering the strongholds above and below Hengyu and actively sweeping away the Majiamiao (northeast of Xiaxian). In order to save the declining situation, the Japanese army has been reinforcing 3-4,000 troops in the past few days, stubbornly resisting. On the morning of the 8th, the Chinese army launched a flank attack on the Japanese army from Qingshancun and northeast of Majiamiao, and directly launched an attack forward. After half a day of hand-to-hand combat, countless Japanese troops were killed. By noon, the line of the (1500) highland and the northeast highland of Majiamiao had been occupied. They are still in a fierce battle in the suburbs of Majiamiao. In addition, more than a thousand Japanese troops from Xiaxian disturbed the east from Shangjiaping, Yangjiayin (east of Xiaxian) and other places on the morning of the 8th, and fought with the Chinese army in the Daling area south of Hanjialing (west of Shangjiaping). The Chinese army is currently flanking the Japanese army attacking east of Xiaxian. (Telegram of the 9th)

Xingji: In the Ronghe area, 400-500 Japanese troops attempted to attack Yuwang Mountain. They were intercepted by the Chinese army, and the battle situation was quite fierce. Another unit raided the rear of the Japanese army, and the Japanese army was unable to withstand the assault and retreated in defeat. The Chinese army also moved to a certain place and encountered the reinforced Japanese army, and launched a bloody battle again. After holding on all day, the Japanese were finally defeated. (Telegram of the 8th)

Xingji: The Japanese troops who invaded Zhongtiao Mountain have suffered heavy losses in recent days. The Japanese troops in Xinjiang, Hejin and other places are extremely panicked. Train tickets south of Houma have been suspended. (Telegram of the 7th)

### North Road慰勞团 Returns to Chongqing to Report

Chongqing: The North Road Comfort Mission departed from Chongqing on June 28th, starting from 　樊 in the south, reaching Wuyuan in the north, Luoyang in the east, and Qinghai in the west, traveling 18,500 miles. They visited and comforted the military and civilians along the way with great effort. Wang Shiyu, the deputy head of the delegation, and the members Hu Xianglin, Chen Xixiang, Lao She, Zhang Xiluo, Xu 　Mo and others returned to Chongqing on the 9th to report. More than a hundred representatives of all sectors of the people welcomed them in the suburbs. When the delegation's special car arrived, music was played loudly and the welcomers rushed forward to shake hands and greet each other, and the atmosphere was very harmonious and enthusiastic. Although the representatives traveled thousands of miles, their spirits were extremely excited and they showed no signs of fatigue. (Telegram of the 9th)

### Soviet Elite Suffers Heavy Losses Attacking Mannerheim Line; Mechanical Units Ineffective in Lake and Marsh Terrain; Fierce Artillery Battles on the Northern Front Yesterday; Finnish Troops Maintain Strong Morale, Holding Original Positions

Copenhagen: The battles on the border between the Soviet Union and Finland have caused the Soviet army to suffer major losses. According to a special correspondent from Denmark, the Soviet Kotiz unit, known for its fighting prowess, was annihilated in large numbers after mistakenly entering a Finnish machine gun position. In this war zone, almost the entire 24 hours of each day are in darkness, so the Finnish army can take advantage of its familiarity with the terrain to attack the Soviet army. (Haitong telegram of the 9th)

Helsinki: It is generally expected here that the Soviet Union's decision to blockade the Finnish coast is a prelude to sending troops to land near Viipuri, with the aim of attacking from the rear to seize Finland's main defensive line, the "Mannerheim Line". People in Helsinki were not surprised by the news of the Soviet blockade, although normal shipping between Åbo and Stockholm will be suspended as a result, but Finland may still be able to control the Gulf of Bothnia. It was heard last night that Soviet troops attacking in the Karelian Isthmus have reached one of the four major defensive lines on the Mannerheim Line in several places. The Soviet offensive along the Voksi River in the northern part of the Isthmus was the most fierce last night. The Soviet army has a larger number of troops, so its advance is difficult to stop, but the Finnish staff said that the retreat of the Finnish army is slower than the Soviet Union expected. The Red Army is currently advancing in a vast area of pine forests, encountering many obstacles, because there are frozen rivers and countless small lakes crisscrossing it. There are no large land markers, and the snow is deep and the terrain is rugged, making it a natural trap for tanks everywhere. The Finnish army is now adopting guerrilla tactics, which can severely damage the enemy and reduce its own casualties. It is reported that the Finnish army is still holding the positions in Petsamo, where the Soviet army has recently increased significantly. It is rumored that Soviet aircraft bombed the Kolosjoki nickel mine yesterday. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

Helsinki: Fierce battles broke out on the northern front early this morning. According to reliable sources, Soviet troops launched a surprise attack on a three-kilometer-long front line, but were ultimately repelled by the Finnish army. The accuracy of the Finnish artillery bombardment is better than that of the Red Army, which is recognized by all military experts. (Havas telegram of the 9th)

Helsinki: Yesterday, on the western side of Kainuu, the artillery battles between the Soviet and Finnish armies were exceptionally fierce. The Red Army is currently attacking the main defensive line of the Finnish army. The Red Army's advance is not only slow, but also greatly damaged because the retreating Finnish army buried landmines in the area through which they passed, and because of the fierce Finnish artillery fire. However, there are not many major battles in other parts of the front line. Finnish military leaders all believe that the Soviet army is currently waiting for the weather to clear up so that they can use aircraft to assist in the attack on the "Mannerheim Line". The wives of Finnish fishermen have always prayed for clear weather for their husbands and brothers every day, but now they mostly hope for dark and cloudy weather when they pray. In recent days, the weather has been as they wished, and the climate is bad, making it difficult for the air force to operate. The Red Army's attempt to cross the Tihuta River has been repelled by the Finnish army. (United Press dispatch)

Helsinki: Military circles here are currently talking about the front-line battles, which have been skirmishes in recent days. In addition to the contact between patrols from both sides in the "no-man's zone" in front of the "Mannerheim Line", there has been no activity by artillery units. Several neutral military observers have recently returned here from the front line. According to them, the Finnish army clearly has the advantage in these contacts because it is familiar with the geography. Soviet patrols often get lost and are captured by the Finnish army. In addition, the Finnish army has strong morale and all its ordnance and equipment are extremely sophisticated. According to various sources, the Red Army has repeatedly resolved to advance, and civilians are in the forefront. These people are mostly political prisoners captured by the Soviet Union in the Polish occupied area. (Havas telegram of the 8th)

Helsinki: The Soviet Red Army entered the Namua area yesterday, and all circles believe that this is an attempt by the Red Army to encircle Finland's Mannerheim Line. Soviet reinforcements have now concentrated in southeastern Finland, advancing towards the southeastern front of Karelia and the eastern border of Finland. According to military observers, the Red Army is now using a strategy similar to that used by the German army to attack Poland, in an attempt to break through Finland's resistance. However, the adverse climate and the stubborn resistance of the Finnish army have thwarted the Soviet plan. (United Press dispatch)

### Soviet Air Force Bombs Hanko Port, Many Residents Killed and Injured

Helsinki: Several Soviet planes bombed the Finnish port of Hanko at will today, causing many deaths and injuries. The exact number is unknown. Residents here are very angry after hearing the news. (Havas telegram of the 9th)

### Hogland Island Occupied by Soviet Union

Helsinki: Finland officially acknowledged that the small island of Hogland in the Gulf of Finland has been occupied by the Soviet Union, saying that only a police patrol was stationed on the island and was evacuated before the attack began. The Soviet Union bombarded the island by sea and air for five days. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

### Finnish Representative Applies to League of Nations to Handle Soviet-Finnish Dispute; League of Nations Council Holds Secret Meeting Yesterday; Sino-Japanese Issue Not on Agenda

Geneva: The Finnish representative to the League of Nations, Holsti, formally submitted an application today based on Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. It is heard that the League of Nations Secretariat has stepped up the process of handling the Soviet-Finnish dispute. It is worth noting that the League of Nations must have a unanimous vote of the Administrative Council before it can expel a member. However, given the current organization, it is almost impossible to obtain unanimous agreement. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

Geneva: The League of Nations Administrative Council, which was scheduled to hold an open meeting today, has been postponed because Finnish representative Holsti has not yet prepared a detailed statement opposing the Soviet Union. It is expected to meet on Monday next week, allowing Holsti to consult with delegations from various countries at ease. The Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting at noon today to discuss the agenda, and will continue the meeting this afternoon. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

Geneva: The 100-odd regular session of the League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting this morning, chaired by Belgian representative Gaton de Vieira. The Soviet Union did not send a representative to the meeting. After the Administrative Council passed the agenda, Chinese representative Gu Weijun immediately declared that the application submitted by China regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict has been included in the agenda of previous meetings of the Administrative Council. Although this session may be an exception and not submitted for discussion, I will still issue a statement on this application when the Administrative Council holds an open meeting. The Administrative Council then decided to continue the meeting at 5 pm today to discuss the Finnish issue. (Havas telegram of the 9th)

Paris: The State Council today decided to have former Prime Minister Peng Gu serve as the chief representative, leading Foreign Ministry Chief Triport, Chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Mistral, and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Bellange to Geneva to attend the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. (Havas telegram of the 8th)

### Britain Unwilling to Offend the Soviet Union, Plans Only to Condemn Perfunctorily

The Argentine government in London had previously telegraphed the League of Nations, requesting a declaration expelling the Soviet Union from the League. However, the Soviet embassy there suddenly released a communique today, implying that if the League of Nations intends to impose sanctions on the Soviet Union or declare the country expelled from the League, many neutral countries in Europe may find it inconvenient to vote. It also stated that when the staff of the Finnish embassy in the Soviet Union departed from Moscow to return home, the envoys of Germany and Italy, as well as Romania, Greece, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, did not send personnel to see them off according to usual diplomatic etiquette, which is noteworthy. Diplomatic circles here attach great importance to this communique and unanimously praise it, believing that Argentina's attitude has become more moderate and that it no longer insists that the League of Nations Administrative Council declare the Soviet Union expelled from the League. This coincides with the views held by most important British figures. In other words, on the one hand, they are severely condemning the Soviet Union's acts of aggression, and on the other hand, they are considering the consequences that the League of Nations' actions against the Soviet Union may cause. Informed sources also say that the essence of Britain's current policy consists of no more than three points: (1) There is absolutely no justification for the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland, and it should be condemned. (2) Within possible limits, Finland should be supplied with as much military equipment and other goods as possible, but the quantity cannot be too large in reality. (3) Britain is willing to cooperate with other countries that sympathize with Finland to actively assist Finland. The above three measures are more practical than other actions that the League of Nations can take. If the League of Nations takes action, it will not only fail to strike the Soviet Union, but will also make the collusion between Germany and the Soviet Union even closer. However, if any member of the League of Nations makes various proposals, even including proposals to implement sanctions or declare the Soviet Union expelled from the League, Britain, as a member state, is willing to study them. In the future, Britain is also willing to abide by any resolutions that are approved by the majority of member states. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)

### Netherlands Has No Intention of Contending for a Council Seat

The Hague Today, the Government Information Office announced that the Dutch government has decided not to accept the candidate status for the vacancy in the League of Nations Administrative Council, believing that it is possible for both the Netherlands and Belgium to attend, but the fact that the Scandinavian countries do not occupy a seat is unhelpful. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

Geneva Excluding Italy, a Council member, (which declared its withdrawal from the League on December 11, 1937), there are a total of fourteen countries in the Administrative Council. Among them, only Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are permanent members. Among the other non-permanent and quasi-permanent members, five countries have either completed their terms, been re-elected, or been succeeded by other countries, which has yet to be determined. What is known is that the seat occupied by New Zealand will be succeeded by another dominion of the British Empire, and the seat occupied by Bolivia will be succeeded by another Latin American country, or perhaps by Argentina.

### Soviet Union Declares War on Finland Without Declaration, Blockade is Clearly Illegal, US Interests If Damaged, Declaration Should Be the Responsibility of the Soviet Union

Oslo The Soviet government has recently notified the Norwegian Navy that the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia will be blockaded by the Soviet Union from this afternoon. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

Helsinki After the Soviet government implemented a blockade of the Finnish coast, local officials here declared that since the country insists that it is not at war with our country, its blockade of our coast is naturally an illegal act. Even in terms of a "peacetime blockade," it is necessary for the blockaded party to have indeed violated the League of Nations Covenant before it can be implemented, and it must be participated in by all civilized countries. Since our country has no such situation, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's actions have absolutely no legal basis. In addition, the waters around the Åland Islands have been mined by our country, and Soviet warships cannot enter the Gulf of Bothnia, so the blockade has little practical effect. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)

Helsinki The German embassy in Finland yesterday requested that all German ships anchored in Finnish ports leave their original ports before noon today. This notice implies that the Soviet Union will soon impose a blockade on the Finnish coast, but the Finnish government declares that Finland is not afraid of the Russian blockade, because the Russian naval power is not sufficient to make the blockade effective. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 9th)

Washington US Secretary of State Hull stated today that the US government will hold the Soviet Union responsible for any damage to American or US interests caused by the Soviet blockade of Finland. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

### Sweden Has the Determination to Defend the Country, Soviet Union Denies Intent to Invade Sweden

Stockholm, Sweden Swedish Minister of Defense Sköld stated yesterday that no matter how difficult the future may be, Sweden must be determined to defend its freedom and independence. At the same time, the government has received many applications requesting the expulsion of communists. (Haitong dispatch of the 9th)

Moscow United Press International recently published a message stating that, according to the Dutch authorities, the Finnish side found "documents and maps" on the bodies of "captured Red Army soldiers," which clearly indicated "bombing targets on the east coast of Sweden and the Åland Islands." The agency added an editor's note saying, "This proves that the Soviet Union is currently preparing to expand its hostile actions to the Atlantic coast." TASS is hereby ordered to deny this absurd and ridiculous news from the American news agency, because it is purely fabricated by the agency from beginning to end. (TASS dispatch of the 9th)

### Soviet and Turkish Borders Massing Troops, Turkish Official Statement Denies

Ankara Official circles here firmly deny the German claim that heavy troops from both the Soviet Union and Turkey have been concentrated on the Soviet-Turkish border, saying that Turkey and the Soviet Union have not adopted military plans on their common border. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

### France and Spain Sympathize with Finland, Various Sectors in the US Raise Relief Funds

Paris French Prime Minister Daladier spoke in the Chamber of Deputies last night, saying that the aggression against Finland has caused aversion and surprise. He paid tribute to Finland and issued a promise of France's great sympathy, believing that the feelings of the entire French nation, regardless of class or party, are the same. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

Madrid The Spanish cabinet held a meeting last night and passed a resolution expressing indignation at the invasion of Finland and denouncing the Soviet Union's aggression as a barbaric act. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)

New York People across the United States are continuing to express sympathy to Finland. Hotel employees in New Jersey have voluntarily launched a donation drive to help Finnish refugees, and they have raised a considerable amount in a short period of time. Thirteen giants in the New York City banking industry have formed a special committee to issue donation notices to bank employees across the country, express their admiration for the Finnish people, and say that all those who love freedom should take them as a model.

### Soviet Union Establishes Special Military District on Romanian Border, This Move Has Important Significance, Soviet Air Force Commander-in-Chief Replaced

Moscow It was announced here last night that the Soviet army established a special army district in the Ottese district on the Soviet-Romanian border yesterday, listed as a second-level army district. This move is considered to have profound meaning, because the Communist Party newspaper raised the demand for Bessarabia to be returned to the Soviet Union. (United Press dispatch of the 9th)

Moscow "Red Star Daily" recently reported that after the establishment of the Ottese Military District, the government appointed General Baulting as commander of the military district. In addition, Air Force Commander General Luktiunov has been transferred to the position of Deputy People's Commissar of Defense, and his vacancy has been filled by General Smukevich.

### Soviet Union Wishes to Maintain Friendship with Romania, An Article in a Communist International Magazine is Insufficient to Represent the Official View

Moscow An article published in a Communist International magazine the other day stated that Romania should conclude a mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union, the content of which is the same as that established by the Soviet Union and the Baltic countries, otherwise the Soviet Union will conduct propaganda among the minority ethnic groups in Romania. The Information Office of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs recently issued a statement, saying, in brief, that the content of this article does not conform to the policies pursued by the Soviet Union towards Romania.

### United States Declares to Britain Maintenance of International Law Integrity, Also Sent Note to Britain Regarding the Confiscation of German Goods, US Merchant Ship Navigation Plan Under Study

London The American Chargé d'Affaires in Britain met with Foreign Office officials this afternoon and presented a note, declaring a reservation of all rights regarding Britain's blockade of German export trade. The British government will submit a reply after careful study. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)

Washington The United States has notified Britain that it is reserving its rights under international law due to the Allies' decision to confiscate German exports carried by neutral ships. The original text was published here today, stating that the tendency to disregard international law is threatening the security of peace-loving countries, and at this time, we must strive to uphold the integrity of international law. If Britain's order to confiscate German exports is implemented, American ships carrying goods produced or owned by Germany will be taken to British ports, regardless of the place of loading or unloading, and regardless of the ownership of the goods when the ship is intercepted. According to American legislation, American ships have been prohibited from operating in certain areas on the west coast of Europe, so the situation of interfering with American ships on the grounds of breaking the blockade should not occur. A belligerent country's plan for another belligerent country should not be appropriately extended to expand the belligerent country's rights over neutral ships, or to the extent that it hinders the legitimate trade of neutral countries. The United States cannot ignore the plans to be adopted by the British Order in Council, and if it is implemented, it will increase the many obstacles and damages that international trade is currently encountering. Diplomatic circles here, in view of the current political situation in the United States and the accusations of isolationists against the government's actions, believe that the wording of this American document could not be more moderate, but they also feel that the US government has failed to use harsher wording, because the United States has not protested against Germany's laying of mines or detaining ships. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)

Washington After meeting with US Ambassador to Britain Kennedy yesterday, President Roosevelt stated at a reception for reporters that the government is currently studying a plan for the navigation of US merchant ships, so that US ships can sail outside the war zone, carrying goods currently carried by ships from the warring countries. The President also said that he would meet with Kennedy yesterday afternoon to discuss world affairs. The President has discussed with Kennedy a plan to restore the southern pine trade, which has been stalled due to the European blockade. Kennedy stated at a reception for reporters yesterday, "The United States will never participate in the European war." When a reporter asked if the Allies hoped for US assistance, Kennedy replied, "No one in the world loves war. If the United States adheres to neutrality, they cannot force it." (United Press dispatch of the 9th)

London Regarding Britain's blockade of German export trade, the US government has submitted a note declaring reservation of rights. British political and public opinion circles originally believed that Germany's submarine and mine warfare posed a major threat to international trade and the lives and property of the people of various neutral countries. Britain had no choice but to take legitimate self-defense measures. In view of the situation, the United States would not, after other neutral countries, make accusations against Britain. Now it is beyond expectations, and after being surprised, I feel quite depressed. Political figures also said that this issue is a matter of life and death in Britain. If it does not want to risk defeat or allow the war to drag on for a long time, it is inconvenient to sit idly by while Germany uses all means to fight, without trying to deal with it. For the benefit of various neutral countries, the two allied countries, Britain and France, must win before they can obtain protection. In short, this matter is a comparison between Sweden's blockade policy and the blockade policies of Britain and France. All neutral countries will be able to choose which side they want to win. Now that the United States has submitted a note, the British government should naturally provide an answer in law and try to reduce inconvenience in practice. (Havas dispatch of the 9th)

New York, Regarding the blockade of German export trade by Britain and France, after the US government submitted a note to Britain yesterday, reserving its rights, the New York Times commented, "The position of the United States has been explained by this note. In other words, the United States, as the most powerful neutral country, has always regarded maintaining international law as its main interest, but it also sympathizes with the efforts of Britain and France to curb German aggression. This is why the word 'protest' was not used in this note. It is hoped that Britain will do its best to ensure that the needs of the country and the interests of the United States do not run counter to each other. (Havas dispatch of the 9th)

### Italy Adopts a Wait-and-See Policy on the European Situation, Especially Emphasizing Balkan Security; German-Italian Alliance Remains Unwavering; Ciano to Clarify Stance Next Saturday

Rome – The "Italian Daily" published an article by Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaida, stating that the Italian state of "non-belligerence" mentioned in the Fascist Grand Council's communiqué differs from neutrality. Any involvement in the Balkan countries involves Italy's interests, which is why Italy pays special attention to developments in the Balkans. The communiqué reflects Italy's reserved attitude and confirms the steadfastness and continuation of Italian policy. German-Italian relations remain unchanged as stipulated in their alliance. It is expected that Foreign Minister Ciano will speak in parliament next week to elaborate on Italy's stance. (Reuters, 9th)

Rome – Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to deliver a speech to the Fascist Corporations Council on the 16th of this month, explaining Italy's current policy. According to reports, the Foreign Minister will present a clear and comprehensive report on Italy's policy at that time. Furthermore, various newspapers have commented on the communiqué issued by the Fascist Grand Council yesterday, stating that Italy attaches the utmost importance to maintaining the status quo in the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube region. The "Messenger" newspaper also stated, "Our country's policy towards the Balkan Peninsula is based on geography, history, economics, and even the European balance of power. In short, the Balkan Peninsula should belong to the Balkan nations." (Havas, 9th)

Paris – The communiqué issued by the Italian Fascist Grand Council yesterday has been commented on by the local morning newspapers, which generally believe that Italy's primary consideration of its own interests is its right and cannot be opposed by anyone. The country's current attitude remains ambiguous, but in fact, considering the course of this war, it is expected that the country would adopt such an attitude. The right-wing "Petit Parisien" newspaper stated, "No one is currently attempting to break the German-Italian axis. If this axis were to break one day, it would be Germany that did it. In other words, it would be because Germany wanted to threaten, destroy, or encompass everything, which has nothing to do with us." The moderate "L'Ordre" newspaper stated that Germany and Italy had once signed a secret agreement stipulating that if one signatory country went to war, the other must provide assistance in the army, navy, and air force. However, if Germany went to war before 1942, the year of the opening of the Rome International Exposition, Italy could temporarily not participate in the war. Foreign Minister Ciano visited Adolf Hitler in Germany on October 8th of this year to declare the country's decision to invoke this reservation clause and avoid joining the war, thus showing that Italy is not refusing to fulfill its obligations under the political and military agreement. In short, Italy's current policy is clearly a wait-and-see policy. The fact that the Fascist Grand Council's communiqué yesterday did not mention the Finnish incident is clear evidence of this. (Havas, 9th)

### Uruguay Decides to Withdraw from the League

Uruguay’s Capital – The Uruguayan Senate, by a vote of 22 to 4, decided to withdraw from the League of Nations. Newspapers prominently featured speeches by senators criticizing the League, believing it had completely failed to guarantee peace and security. Foreign Minister Juan expressed strong opposition to the withdrawal and had attempted to prevent the Senate vote, arguing that a decision should be made after the League of Nations convenes and the attitudes of the various countries are known. Political figures therefore believe that the Senate's decision to withdraw is a failure of the government. Uruguay's note to the League of Nations aimed to expel the Soviet Union from the League, not for Uruguay itself to withdraw. (Haitong, 9th)

### Philippine Hopes to Postpone Independence Deadline; President Quezon to Visit the U.S. Next Summer

Hong Kong International News Agency, Washington, 8th – According to information obtained by this agency, Philippine President Quezon plans to visit the United States next June to urge the U.S. to extend the date for the complete independence of the Philippines beyond the scheduled year of 1946. It is understood that Quezon intends to request the government to amend the Philippine Independence Act, so that the Philippines will not be absolutely independent de jure, but can obtain the status of a self-governing dominion de facto. Official sources say that from the U.S. government's point of view, the Philippine issue is still open to discussion, as the government has always regarded the Philippines as a major key to the U.S. maintaining its position in the Far East. According to reliable sources, U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre has fully informed President Quezon of this intention, and has also told him that the issue of extending Philippine independence should be initiated by the Philippine side first. It is understood that Quezon's trip next year is due to the Philippine people's desire to maintain ties with the U.S., and because of the European and Asian situation, they hope to rely on U.S. military strength for protection. Official sources say that Japan's new policy aims to end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible and has proposed a non-aggression pact to the Soviet Union, which is causing great panic in the Philippines. Once the Japanese troops in China can be redeployed, the Philippines, located in a key position between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, which Japan covets, may be subject to the possibility of Japan using force to implement annexation. Official sources say that Philippine strategists, in order to ensure national security, seem to be prepared to implement the proposal to extend independence. According to sources in Washington, the Philippines, in view of Germany's annexation of Poland with lightning speed, is deeply concerned that if Japan launches a southward advance policy, it may also quickly annex the Philippines. It has also been learned that the Japanese Navy has conducted exercises twice this year off the east coast of New Guinea. (8th)

Manila – According to news from here today, U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre is currently conducting a broad inspection of the Philippines. His automobile has traveled through more than three provinces, meeting with local leaders everywhere and inspecting indigenous troops.

After arriving there, Sayre plans to inspect the Japanese hemp cultivation industry and the Japanese way of life. (United Press, 9th)

### Roosevelt and Landon Discuss Foreign Policy

Washington – Landon, the Republican presidential candidate in 1936, held a formal meeting with President Roosevelt at the White House yesterday to discuss U.S. foreign policy. Some people regard this meeting as having great significance, as it is generally recalled that Landon has repeatedly supported Roosevelt whenever the government has taken major actions on foreign policy. It is also generally recalled that some Republican senators regard President Roosevelt's recognition of the Soviet Union as a major political issue, and the meeting may be related to President Roosevelt's refusal to recall the U.S. ambassador to Moscow or to meet with the two. When Landon left the White House, he claimed that he and the President only discussed foreign policy and that the conversation was "informal." He did not mention the message he sent on Thursday requesting President Roosevelt to announce whether he intended to run for a third term. (United Press, 9th)

### Japan Seeks to Improve Relations with the Soviet Union

Tokyo – Although there is much discussion about Japan's intention to negotiate a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, the general opinion here is that this is not entirely impossible, but it must wait until (1) some pending issues such as the rights of Japanese people in Northern Sakhalin and Japanese fishing issues are resolved, and (2) the Japanese-Soviet trade negotiations are established before negotiations can proceed. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated in its editorial today that the date for the formal opening of the trade negotiations has been tentatively set for mid-January next year. Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo is currently having frank talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in the hope of facilitating the trade negotiations and obtaining a political solution to Japanese-Soviet relations. The Japanese government's commencement of trade negotiations with the Soviet Union before the Japanese-American trade negotiations are abolished clearly has deep meaning. Will Japan actively use the policy of controlling one country with another? (Reuters, 9th)

### Japanese Prime Minister Meets with National Representatives

Tokyo – According to today's "Yomiuri Shimbun," Prime Minister Abe will meet with sixteen leaders of the "Spiritual Mobilization" to hear their reports on the public's reaction to government policies and to learn what measures they want the authorities to take. Among these sixteen people is Hatta, the former Minister of Commerce and Industry, who went to several districts from September to November to listen to the opinions of rural leaders. He learned that the people are now unanimously demanding the elimination of social ills, the cessation of the habit of exchanging gifts, and striving for simple clothing. On the last point, the people feel that government officials and the rich should set an example. Regarding government policies, the people demand a unified approach to the continued war in China and the situation around the world. Of the nine counties he visited, the people wanted the government to clarify its foreign policy so that the public would not be confused. As for the people's emotions towards the countries concerned, they varied greatly, with some advocating friendship with the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, and others opposing it.

### Two Instances of Valor by French Air Force Personnel

Paris – A Havas correspondent who witnessed the heroic actions of French air force personnel on the Eastern Front has selected the two most admirable and decisive achievements and described them as follows: According to reports, four air force personnel, including one reconnaissance officer, one pilot, and two machine gunners, recently boarded a large reconnaissance plane and went to reconnoiter the enemy. As soon as they arrived over the enemy's position, they were confronted by six Messerschmitt fighter planes. A fierce battle immediately broke out between the two sides. The French machine gunners calmly responded and at one point repelled the enemy planes, but soon the enemy planes returned and fired intensively at the reconnaissance plane with machine guns. The fuselage and wings were riddled with bullets. Finally, the enemy used incendiary bombs and hit the plane's left engine, which immediately caught fire. The plane suddenly descended from a height of 6,000 meters to 2,000 meters. At that time, the reconnaissance officer and one of the machine gunners had already been shot and killed. The other machine gunner was ordered by the pilot to jump with a parachute, but according to various reports, this person also failed to land safely. The pilot himself was injured, but he still flew the plane back to French territory. The plane finally landed not far from the front line, and the pilot died. According to the French Air Force authorities, the photos and other documents taken by the plane did not fall into the hands of the enemy. This is all due to the pilot's loyalty and dedication. In addition, another reconnaissance plane, after taking many photos, was surrounded by a squadron of enemy planes. The reconnaissance plane ascended and hid in the clouds, and fired at the enemy planes with machine guns. It then hurriedly flew back to its base, but the enemy planes closely pursued, firing intensively at it along the way. The reconnaissance plane's two machine gunners were both seriously injured and the machine guns were also damaged, so that it had no ability to fight back. At that time, the situation was already bordering on despair, but the pilot's improvisation allowed him to safely return to the base. However, all personnel were injured when they got off the plane and were immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. The heroic situation can be seen. (Havas, 8th)

Swiss Capital – German radio recently broadcast the news that the Romanian cargo ship "Durdub" carrying a large quantity of grain from the port of Constanța to Palestine has sunk in the Black Sea for unknown reasons. The whereabouts of the twelve crew members are unknown. (Havas, 8th)

### "Sao Dang Bao" Warns the United States

Chongqing's "Sao Dang Bao" today commented on the losses suffered by Americans since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War due to Japanese bombing. The newspaper continued, saying that 50% to 60% of the losses suffered by American people and property in China at the hands of the Japanese were caused by weapons that the United States supplied to Japan. Now, Nomura is once again using sweet words with Grew, saying that Japan does not want to harm American rights and interests, but in fact, American lives and property are not guaranteed at all. Nomura's claim that Japan can guarantee that such incidents will not happen again is an empty check, because the Japanese government has never been able to keep its word, and even if the government hopes to keep its word, its soldiers in China will definitely not put the government in their eyes. In short, Nomura will definitely have no control over the military, so Grew and the American authorities should definitely not be deceived by what Nomura says. (United Press, 9th)

Chongqing today issued a statement describing the bombing of American industries in China by Japanese aircraft. It is said that since the outbreak of war between China and Japan over the Lugouqiao Incident and up to September of this year, a total of 36 American churches and schools have been bombed, resulting in 24 deaths and 25 injuries. (It is believed that this number includes both Americans and Chinese.) American properties destroyed by Japanese bombers also include the gunboat Panay and one aircraft of the China National Aviation Corporation, namely the Guilin. According to estimates by the Chinese official news agency, American properties have been bombed by Japanese aircraft a total of 150 times. (Reuters, 9th)

### National Government Orders Praise for Wu Peifu

Chongqing National Government Order of the 9th: (1) Wu Peifu is to be posthumously awarded the rank of General of the First Class of the Army. This order, (2) The late Army General Wu Peifu was upright in character and steadfast in his aspirations. In the past, he reorganized the army and achieved remarkable fame. He hated evil and expelled the wicked, maintained righteousness and was incorruptible, which was beneficial to the world and people's hearts. Since the Mukden Incident, he has been concerned about national difficulties and has always encouraged himself with utmost loyalty. After the fall of Peiping, his situation became more difficult, but he was able to maintain his position from beginning to end, adding glory to the country and nation. His heroic demeanor and noble character were admired by both Chinese and foreigners. It was hoped that he would enjoy a long life and be a model for others. However, he passed away due to a minor illness, and in memory of his loyalty and righteousness, we express our deepest sorrow. He should be publicly praised, and the Military Affairs Commission should deliberate on generous condolences. A special funeral fee of 10,000 yuan is granted. His life story should be recorded and sent to the Historical Archives to show the state's concern for virtuous and upright people and to encourage utmost loyalty and righteousness. This order.

After the death of General Wu Peifu, the Chinese newspapers under Japanese control in Peiping expressed great praise for Wu, and the Japanese military spokesman also spoke to express his admiration, calling Wu the most capable and upright figure among Chinese soldiers, and saying that Wu's death was a great loss to Japan. He also said that Wu had expressed his willingness to assist the Japanese before his death, but the spokesman could not say to whom Wu had made this statement. Currently, Qi Xieyuan, Wang Yitang, Chen Zhongfu, and others are preparing for funeral affairs. The Peiping authorities have ordered all agencies to fly flags at half-mast on the third day of Wu's death and plan to hold a meeting to discuss the funeral ceremony. Wu's family has received numerous condolence telegrams and letters. Japanese dignitaries such as Konoe have also sent telegrams of condolence. Wu's coffin is temporarily placed in his residence in Dongcheng and is scheduled to be buried on the seventh day. It will be moved to Changchun Temple, and after the arrangements are completed, it will be buried in Penglai, Shandong Province. (9th)

Although the Japanese military in Peiping has released He Yingqin's condolence telegram to Wu Peifu's family to the press, Wu's family has not received this telegram. According to Chinese reports, Jin Yunpeng, the former Premier of the Anfu Clique, arrived in Peiping from Tianjin today. The Japanese military may give Jin the position previously given to Wu Peifu.

### The Concession Authorities Set a Rice Price Limit, Strictly Enforced Starting Today, with the Highest Grade White Rice at Forty-Five Yuan Per Shi, and Xian Rice Priced at Thirty-Eight Yuan Per Shi; Violators Will Be Reported to the Public Works Department for Punishment

The concession authorities of both concessions are quite concerned about the entire rice market in Shanghai. Given the rising rice prices, which are greatly related to the security within the concessions, it is heard that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession is preparing legal sanctions. Mr. Hoteck Quy, the Deputy General Manager of the department, specifically telegraphed Mr. Fu Qian Geng, the Director of the Rice Shop Tea Association Market Management Committee, and Mr. Zhang Nian Xuan, the Chairman of the Rice Merchants Association, at 2:00 PM yesterday. After receiving the telegram, Mr. Fu and Mr. Zhang rushed to the department to meet with Mr. Hoteck. Mr. Fu and Mr. Zhang separately reported on the recent situation of the rice market, the source of rice, the chaotic situation of the market, and the strict supervision of the transactions of fellow traders in the market. Mr. Hoteck immediately discussed the selling price of rice: (1) the highest price for white rice should be forty-five yuan per shi (one market shi is 160 catties), and (2) the price for Xian rice should be thirty-eight yuan per shi, and no one should take advantage of the situation to raise prices, in order to maintain the entire rice market within the concessions. Anyone exceeding this price limit will be reported to the authorities for severe punishment.

Soybean and Rice Association Holds Emergency Meeting

In addition to instructing the Rice Shop Association Market Management Committee to take strict measures to ban illegal cross-level transactions in the market, the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Trade Association also convened the 57th joint meeting of the 3rd Executive and Supervisory Committee at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Exchange on the second floor of 15 Avenue Edward VII. Seventeen committee members attended, including Xing Zhi Gang, Chen Zi Yi, Zhu Zi Xiang, She Bing Wen, Jin Zhao Yun, Hu Wen An, Cha Sheng Ming, Fu Qian Geng, Yin Fu Xiang, Xu Ye Sun, Zhou Zhi Zhen, Gu Yi Sheng, Zhang Nian Xuan, Zhu Xiang Sheng, Jiang Hong Bin, Yan Xiao Quan, and Zhang Li Zhong. Xing Zhi Gang, the chairman, first reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by Fu Qian Geng reporting on his meeting with the authorities and the chaotic situation of the rice market. Chen Zi Yi then contributed his opinions on comprehensive solutions. The discussion then began and concluded at 8:00 PM.

Planning for Comprehensive Solutions

One motion was discussed yesterday: The recent increase in rice prices is causing hardship for the common people and affecting local security. How should we find ways to remedy this situation and achieve balance? Upon investigation, the recent increase in rice prices is a cause for concern. We should find ways to remedy this situation and achieve balance. The association, recognizing the importance of this matter, convened a meeting for serious discussion and believes that there are three short-term solutions: (1) Accept the Public Works Department's intention to temporarily set the price of high-grade white rice at no more than forty-five yuan per shi, and foreign rice and Ke Xian rice at no more than thirty-eight yuan per shi, with Du Xian and Yang Xian rice excluded from this rule. This will be announced and implemented from the 10th of this month, and the Management Committee will strictly enforce it. Violators will be reported to the concession authorities for punishment. (2) The agreement reached in the rice market yesterday to set a three-day deadline for the delivery of domestic rice is a good policy and should be ratified, but it should be supplemented to ensure that all domestic rice, Xian rice, and foreign rice are delivered within three days of the transaction. Violators should be severely punished. (3) Please report any unscrupulous merchants who are manipulating the market and hoarding goods as much as possible. The association will forward the reports to the concession authorities for severe punishment. There are also three long-term solutions: (1) From yesterday onwards, all rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains transported to the port by train should not be allowed to be transported to the concessions. We should immediately write to the concession authorities to find a way to dredge the canal to alleviate the urgent need. Also, the price of Wuhu rice is only a little over fifteen yuan at most. We should immediately write to the concession authorities to find a way to obtain 50,000 bags of Wuhu Xian rice export permits for merchants to use, thereby increasing the source. The price can be set by the concession authorities according to the cost. (2) It is suggested that the concession authorities, the Chamber of Commerce, and Yu Qia Qing convene a meeting of various public organizations to discuss group purchases of foreign rice to increase strength and add sources. Please also ask the Chamber of Commerce to inform the banking industry to provide loans as much as possible to those who purchase domestic or foreign rice. (3) Please ask the Chamber of Commerce and Yu Qia Qing to forward a request to the Ministry of Finance, following the previous example, to apply for legal foreign exchange, at least to order 50,000 bags of foreign rice to be used for price stabilization and to help the poor.

Actively Negotiating Second Price Stabilization Effort

Yu Qia Qing had previously initiated a group purchase of Saigon foreign rice, entrusted to the Accountants Association for registration, and this association, together with the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association and other organizations, organized the first price stabilization effort. Although it was a drop in the bucket and did not solve the problem, many people went to buy miscellaneous goods. This time, the source of rice has not been interrupted, but the price of rice has continued to rise, breaking the new record of forty-eight yuan. The Soybean and Rice Trade Association, recognizing this, had Zhang Nian Xuan contact Yu Qia Qing to discuss a second Saigon rice price stabilization effort. Recognizing the importance of this matter, it was determined that it could not be achieved in the short term. Currently, all parties are actively negotiating, and once everything is in order, it will be categorized and processed step by step.

Large Quantities of Saigon Rice Traded Continuously

Yesterday, it was learned from various rice industry organizations in the city that Shun Feng Rice Trading Firm in the city had successively commissioned the French Da Fu Foreign Firm, the British He Yi Foreign Firm, the Swedish Fu Jia Foreign Firm, and the Jian Yuan Hua Firm to order Saigon foreign rice to be transported to Shanghai for regulation, totaling 330,000 bags agreed by telegram. One-third of them, or 110,000 bags, have been transported to Shanghai. It is learned that the Qin Lai Ma Le, Suzhou, Chongqing, Qin Lai Bao Tuo, and other ships left Saigon for Shanghai on the 28th of last month and the 7th and 8th of this month, all loaded with large quantities of Saigon rice, and will arrive in port within a few days. The Saigon rice transported by the Nan Ning ship was unloaded by 3:00 PM yesterday. It is reported that yesterday, another telegram was sent to the Swedish Fu Jia Foreign Firm to trade 5 tons of No. 2 Saigon rice, weighing 198 catties per bag, and another 5 tons of broken rice.

Market Management Committee Issues Public Notice This Morning

The Rice Shop Tea Association Market Management Committee agreed the day before yesterday that the delivery of goods after transactions among fellow traders in the market should be limited to three days for the time being. Whether it is customer selling to shop, shop selling to firm, or firm selling to shop, all must comply and allow for actual transactions and must not engage in empty sales. The punishment methods include suspending business for minor violations and requesting the General Association to revoke membership for major violations. The notice was issued to the market and sent to more than one hundred firms yesterday morning. It is learned that the committee has scheduled its 56th committee meeting at the public sampling office in the market at 10:00 AM this morning. At that time, the price limits of forty-five yuan for the highest grade white rice and thirty-eight yuan for foreign rice and Ke Xian rice will be reported, and all rice trading firms will be strongly urged to comply, in order to stabilize the entire rice market. The Soybean and Rice Trade Association decided to issue a public notice to the market this morning to implement it.

### Memorial Service for Wu Guang Xin Held by Various Circles This Morning

### Christmas Economy Campaign

The Shanghai YMCA Industrial Department, considering the cold weather and the special circumstances in the Nanshi area, where many refugees are homeless and without adequate clothing, appealed to various circles to raise funds for winter clothing. Thanks to the enthusiastic donations from Chinese and foreign philanthropists, the results have been remarkable. However, the number of refugees in the area is large, and the amount of winter clothing raised is still insufficient to meet the needs. Many are still thinly clad and unable to withstand the cold. Efforts to raise funds for winter clothing are still being promoted in many ways. In view of the imminent arrival of Christmas, a campaign to save money and aid the needy has been launched. The purpose is to save money on Christmas celebrations to fund the purchase of winter clothing. The campaign is currently underway to benefit the refugees. The office is located at Room 308, 113 Jiujiang Road, telephone number 16082.

### Japanese Police Arrest Several People for Forging Permits

All the destroyed locomotives, etc., were overturned in the surrounding fields. Upon hearing the news, Japanese troops along the line rushed to the scene to search. They engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops in the ×× area, and heavy gunfire ensued. As a result, the Japanese troops were repelled by the Chinese forces. When Japanese reinforcements arrived, the Chinese troops had already safely returned to their original positions. The Japanese reinforcements conducted a thorough search in the ×× area, arrested innocent farmers, and forced nearby residents to repair the tracks.

Between the 7th and 8th, a large number of troops from Taiwan and Manchukuo, totaling more than nine thousand, suddenly arrived in the Nanshi area.

The troops were transferred from Wuhu, with disorganized uniforms and lacking winter clothing. At 8:00 PM on the night of the 7th, three soldiers from the puppet Manchukuo army broke into a civilian house near the puppet police station outside the Dananmen gate in Nanshi, searching for winter quilts. When the elderly occupant refused, they were enraged and stabbed him to death with a bayonet. After the arrival of these troops, the residents of Nanshi were terrified, fearing for their safety and discussing ways to protect themselves. Young men and women were particularly alarmed. It is also learned that the Shangchuan Guild Hall in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, and several newly built Western-style civilian houses at the former site of the police headquarters on Xundao Street inside Dadongmen are spacious and were not destroyed in the war. They have now been furnished with low beds and are prepared to house large numbers of Japanese troops who are being transferred to Shanghai. It is said that the total number of Japanese troops being transferred to Shanghai is in the tens of thousands and that they will all arrive by the 15th of this month.

Lieutenant Commander Fox, the director of the Purchasing Office, prepared a report

Submitted the report

Presented to Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the US Yangtze Patrol Fleet. The Rear Admiral had left for Wuhu by ship on the 7th on official business and must wait until he returns to Shanghai to take action. This was reported by a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency on the 8th. The Japanese side, realizing that they were in the wrong, sent Major Hayashi of the Marine Military Police to visit US Acting Consul General Lockhart to formally

Expressed an apology

That evening, a Japanese Navy spokesperson stated at a press briefing that the case had been reconciled because Major Hayashi had visited the US Consul General and that the case was due to a misunderstanding between the two sides. When a reporter visited the US Consulate yesterday, it was learned that the Japanese side's belief that a "reconciliation" had been reached was a unilateral hope.

Zhu Kaimin, Bishop of Haimen District and Ma's nephew, came to Shanghai from Haimen a few days ago and decided to hold a memorial mass on the day of the "57th day" anniversary. However, since the 8th was a Catholic holiday, the memorial ceremony could not be held, so it was postponed to 7:15 AM yesterday at St. Peter's Church on Lyuban Road.

### Shanghai Telephone Company Expands Switchboard

Yu Qiaqing Road West Telephone Added Numbers Starting with Six

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the population has surged, and the original lines and switchboard equipment of the Shanghai Telephone Company have become insufficient. All numbers in the Central District of the Public Concession starting with 10,000 and 90,000 and in the Central District of the French Concession starting with 8 and in the Western District starting with 7 will be full. This is especially true for numbers in the Western District of the Public Concession starting with 3. Therefore, the company has specially used the numbers starting with 6, which were previously used in the Central District of the Public Concession, as the numbers for new users in the district, including the area north of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, south of the Suzhou Creek, west of Yu Qiaqing Road, and as far as Jing'an Temple (excluding areas beyond the concession). If new users in the area request telephone installation, it will generally start with 60,000. More than 200 units have already been installed. At the same time, the company has decided to expand the manual switchboards starting with numbers 1, 9, 8, and 7 to facilitate users' installation and calls.

Chairman's Report

Chairman Pei Yunqing reported that today is the eighth redemption of principal of the 1936 Unified Public Debt Class E Bonds and the seventeenth redemption of principal of the 1935 Electrical Administration Public Debt. The lottery method for the Unified Public Debt uses the last three digits, and the lottery method for the Electrical Administration Public Debt uses the last two digits. I will briefly report on the circumstances of the above public debts to everyone. The Unified Public Debt Class E Bonds were issued in February 1936, with a fixed amount of 260 million yuan. This is the eighth redemption of principal, with eight draws, each draw worth 260,000 yuan, for a total of 2,080,000 yuan. The 1935 Electrical Administration Public Debt was issued in October 1935, with a fixed amount of 10 million yuan. This is the seventeenth redemption of principal, with three draws, each draw worth 100,000 yuan, for a total of 300,000 yuan. The payment of principal and accrued interest for the Electrical Administration Public Debt lottery winners will begin on December 31, 1939, and will be paid by the Central, China, and Communications Banks in various locations. The payment of principal and accrued interest for the Unified Public Debt lottery winners will begin on January 31, 1940, in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Ministry of Finance, and will be paid by the Central Bank and its authorized China and Communications Banks and the Central Trust Bureau in various locations. Now, I would like to ask the supervisors to check the lottery tickets and the ledger for accuracy before executing the lottery.

Winning Numbers

After the supervisors checked the lottery tickets and the ledger for accuracy, representatives from the Central, China, and Communications Banks executed the lottery. The winning numbers are listed below. (1) Unified Public Debt, eight draws: No. 033, No. 129, No. 281, No. 393, No. 676, No. 775, No. 831, No. 936. (2) Electrical Administration Public Debt, three draws: No. 20, No. 74, No. 83. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the eighth redemption of principal and payment of interest for the five types of Unified Public Debt (A, B, C, D, and E) will begin at the end of January next year, but the specific procedures will be announced by the Ministry at that time. The seventeenth redemption of principal and payment of interest for the Electrical Administration Public Debt is scheduled to begin on the 31st of this month, but due to the interception of international telegraph fees, which serve as collateral, it is feared that the payment of principal and interest due this time will continue to be delayed.

### Shame and Integrity Movement Holds Meeting, Sends Condolences to Wu Peifu's Family

The Shanghai Shame and Integrity Movement Committee believes that General Wu Ziyu was in an adverse environment, but was not tempted by profit or intimidated by power. He supported the Party and the country and was unswervingly loyal. Now that he has passed away due to tooth disease, the committee expresses its deep condolences and sends a telegram to General Wu's family to express its condolences. The telegram reads: "To the family of General Wu Ziyu in Beiping, greetings. Mr. Ziyu once held a military seal and had the demeanor of a Confucian general. He then hid in the mountains and forests, resolute in his ambition as a man. With tigers and wolves pressing in, he was not intimidated by force. With foxes and rats running rampant, he was able to maintain his purity and resist vulgarity. He was the righteousness of the country and a model for the people. Suddenly hearing the news of his death, the cause of death is quite suspicious. Looking forward to the smoke and dust, the living must be more inspired. We offer our condolences and hope you will restrain your grief. Shanghai Shame and Integrity Movement Committee seal."

All Circles Initiate the Construction of a Bronze Statue

After General Wu Ziyu, a famous Chinese Confucian general and veteran, passed away in Ping on the 4th of this month due to a tooth disease, the news spread and the whole country mourned. The Supreme National Defense Council believes that Wu has been in the enemy's atmosphere for several years, but he has remained unblemished, strictly rejected inducements and threats, and maintained his integrity in his later years, demonstrating his righteousness. Therefore, he was posthumously awarded the rank of first-class general, and the National Government issued an order to commend him in order to encourage and motivate. "This autumn, all circles in the city also believe that General Wu's loyalty is outstanding and his righteousness is awe-inspiring, which is not only enough to make the crowd ashamed, but also the national righteousness is relied upon to flourish. His great personality is enough to leave a fragrance in history and last forever. In today's atmosphere of demonism, if there is no commemoration of Wu, there will be no way to commemorate the sages and warn the unworthy. Therefore, it was decided to initiate the fundraising for a bronze statue of General Wu. However, due to the special environment in Shanghai, a committee will not be established for the time being. It was decided to first conduct fundraising separately, requesting major newspapers to temporarily collect the donations. After raising a considerable amount, the method of building the bronze statue will be discussed, or the proposal will be suggested to the central government for adoption, and the donations will be remitted to Chongqing to comfort the heroic spirit and last forever."

### Fuxing Road Traffic Restored

Barbed Wire Has Been Removed Yesterday

The intersection of the bottom of North Jiangxi Road and Bazi Road was equipped with barbed wire frames and other obstacles during the Shanghai War. When the Japanese army blockaded the eastern section of North Jiangxi Road, another barbed wire frame was added there. The passage from North Jiangxi Road to Fuxing Road was also blocked by barbed wire and other obstacles, and pedestrians had to detour. Until yesterday, several Japanese soldiers carried knives and axes and removed the barbed wire frames placed at the intersection of the bottom of North Jiangxi Road and Bazi Road and at the passage to Fuxing Road. The traffic between North Jiangxi Road and Fuxing Road has now been restored, but the western side of the blocked area of North Jiangxi Road and the eastern section of Bazi Road are still blocked by barbed wire frames.

### After the Success of Sino-Soviet Airmail, Shanghai-Europe Airmail Route

After the success of the Chongqing-Moscow air route, airmail to European countries can be sent via this route in the future. However, according to a Datsong News Agency reporter who inquired at the Shanghai Post Office, it is currently more convenient to ship airmail from the city to European countries by boat to Hong Kong, where it is transferred to aircraft for Europe. Therefore, it has not been received and sent via the Sino-Soviet airmail route. However, post offices in Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, and Hami have begun to receive and send mail.

If Sent by Airmail, It Can Arrive in France Before the Holiday

Recently, as Christmas and the New Year are approaching, foreigners in the city are enthusiastically sending greeting cards.

On the 11th of this month, another batch will be sent to Europe via the Suez Canal, and will arrive in London on January 13th.

### Bizarre Kidnapping Case Occurred on Jiaozhou Road the Night Before Last, Xiao Was Suddenly Kidnapped on the Way Home from the Theater, Watchman Reported to the Police with Suspicious Behavior and Was Detained, and the Suspect Was Arrested Together with the Domestic Servant

At 8:50 p.m. the night before last, a kidnapping case occurred in House No. 11, Lane 148, Jiaozhou Road. The situation is recorded as follows:

Xiao Shi, a Cantonese

He opened the Guangya Dyeing and Weaving Factory at the bottom of Jiaozhou Road and lived with his wife at No. 11, Lane 148, Jiaozhou Road. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Xiao went out to watch a movie in their own car No. 2477 and returned late at night. After dinner, Xiao went upstairs alone to rest in the bedroom. Unexpectedly, at 8:50 p.m., three kidnappers suddenly entered from the back door, showed guns, and threatened to make a noise. One of the kidnappers went upstairs,

Kidnapped Xiao

Dragged him into a pre-hired car, and drove away quickly. Before leaving, the bandits falsely said that they were sent by the police station, and told them not to be afraid. Unexpectedly, after the kidnappers left, not long after, Wang Jinshan, a watchman from No. 1470 in the lane, who was a native of Anhui, first broke into Xiao's house and reported to the police station by telephone that Xiao had been kidnapped. When the Jing'an Temple Police Station heard the alarm, they immediately sent Chinese detective Wu Wenke and Western detective Gulokov to investigate. Because the kidnappers had just left in this case, the people in the room had not yet reported to the police, but the doorkeeper Wang Jinshan already knew everything,

First Report

This situation was really suspicious, so he asked Wang for information. According to him, before the kidnappers kidnapped Xiao Shi, they first threatened him, took away his gun, and ordered him to face the wall. After the kidnapping, they returned the gun to him. His confession was vague and highly suspicious, so he was arrested and taken to the police station along with Lu Fusheng, a 14-year-old runaway servant from Anhui at Xiao's house. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the above situation, saying that Chen Fusheng and his brother Chen Yinsheng had been

Adopted and raised by Xiao since childhood

Later, Chen Yinsheng was introduced by someone to work at the Hollywood Casino. Recently, Chen Yinsheng asked Xiao's wife for a loan but failed. He held a grudge and once expressed in front of Wang Jinshan that he wanted to kidnap Xiao. Before the incident last night, Xiao's wife also saw Chen Yinsheng in the lane, so Wang Chen was highly suspected, and he should be allowed to be detained for investigation. After the judge Xiao checked the confession, he ordered that he be allowed to be detained for seven days for further investigation.

### The Property of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple Is in Constant Litigation

A temple of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple in Shengdeli, Rue du Pere Froc, French Concession, was mortgaged to the British business Guangdi Real Estate Company by the former abbot. Because it was not redeemed when it was due, the principal and interest totaled 18,000 yuan. Guangdi Company sued the Second Special Court, and the judgment was made to execute the auction. Abbot Qinliang of Jingci Temple in Hangzhou purchased it from Guangdi Company as a branch of Jingci Temple. When taking over, because the current

Abbot Yuanhua

The monks did not want to move out on the orders of the board of directors, Yuanhua filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Qinliang to confirm the ownership of the temple property, while Qinliang also filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Yuanhua for occupying the temple property and obstructing freedom. Yuanhua also filed a counterclaim, and it was discussed that criminal proceedings would be carried out after the civil confirmation of property rights was determined. Later, Monk Guanru, the abbot of Yuhuang Temple adjacent to Sanjiao Leshan Temple (formerly Abbot Yangxi of Jing'an Temple in the West of Shanghai), also filed a private prosecution in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Monk Qinliang for

Obstructing the Freedom of Worship

Qinliang also filed a counterclaim for false accusation. As a result, Qinliang was found not guilty, and Guanru was sentenced to two months' imprisonment with a two-year reprieve. The three parties were constantly litigating for the property of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple. The situation has been recorded in previous reports. Now, Monk Qinliang has filed a complaint with the French Police Station, accusing Monks Guanru and Ziqing of occupying the property of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple, which has made it impossible to take over for a long time since the purchase, and has obstructed freedom. He requested that the case be investigated. The police chief approved the words and summoned the two defendants to the case.

After an Investigation

Yesterday afternoon, the two parties were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Lawyer Fei Xizhen of the French Concession Administrative Authority explained the case and filed a public prosecution on the charge of obstructing freedom. After Judge Qiu Huanxing questioned the plaintiff Qinliang and the defendants Guanru and Ziqing, he instructed that the hearing be postponed to the 20th for further investigation. After leaving the court, Monk Qinliang also

Incited the Case of Rolling Away

Wan Yuan was arrested and imprisoned and is now serving his sentence, while Sun Lanzhen confessed when she was arrested that she had taken out three gold bracelets and 2,000 yuan in cash when she rolled away, and handed them over to Wan Yuan, who transferred them to Qinliang for the purchase of the property of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple. Yang Yunwu then filed a lawsuit against Qinliang, and the court repeatedly issued summonses, but Qinliang avoided appearing in court. Yesterday, the investigating detective learned that Qinliang had come to court to respond to the case of Guanru and Ziqing obstructing freedom, so he took Qinliang to the police station to await verification.

### Embezzlement of Hardware Materials, Civil and Criminal Cases Adjudicated

Fan Dazhang (also known as Fan Juemin), a native of Ningbo, was a broker in Fuxingxiang Hardware Store at No. 263 Chengdu Road. From August 15th to November 9th of this year, Fan suddenly used the names of Taikang Biscuit Company, Tianyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Xieji Timber Store, and Guangzhong Paper Mill to privately engrave seals. He used fraudulent methods to embezzle 9,038 yuan of hardware materials. Xie Shaofang, the owner of Fuxingxiang Store, found out and hired Lawyer Le Junwei to report to the police station, ordering the detectives to arrest Fan Dazhang and escort him to the First Special Court. After repeated interrogations, the case has been concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao announced the verdict in the Second Criminal Court. Fan Dazhang was sentenced to one year and two months' imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of business property. In the attached civil lawsuit, Fan Dazhang should repay the plaintiff 5,783 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen. If he is still unable to repay after compulsory execution, his guarantor Pu Meisheng shall be responsible for compensation. The forged receipts, return receipts, and seals shall be confiscated as listed.

### Impersonating and Claiming Remittances, Bailer to be Summoned for Further Interrogation

Chen Qianwen, a 17-year-old girl from Guangdong, residing at No. 32, Jiande Lane, Yuyuan Road, entrusted Ugo Cheiso, an Italian who had dealings with Citibank on Jiujiang Road, to guarantee between October 18th and last month, impersonating and claiming 1,800 US dollars (more than 20,000 legal currency) remitted from San Francisco, USA to Shanghai and delivered to Chen Sanmei. At the end of last month, Chen Sanmei, who resided at No. 4, Jing'an Villa, took a letter to the bank to question why the funds remitted from San Francisco had not been notified for collection for so long. At this point, the bank realized the mistake, so it secretly sent someone to the address to arrest Chen Qianwen and hand her over to the police station for escort to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention for investigation. The defendant claimed that she had an uncle doing business in San Francisco. When Citibank notified her to collect the funds last month, the name translated by the English translator was similar to her name. She thought it was the funds sent by her uncle and did not intend to defraud. The case was continued yesterday morning, and the police station filed a public prosecution against the defendant for fraud. Judge Zhan presided over the trial. The police station requested an extension because the Italian who guaranteed the collection of funds sent a telegram from Tokyo stating that he would return to Shanghai within three or four days to testify in court. The court checked the words and ordered the defendant to be remanded and the trial adjourned.

### Assassination Bloodbath on Foch Road, Ge Shusen Shot in the Leg, Later Admitted Himself to Fumin Hospital for Treatment

According to Japanese sources, Ge Shusen, a certain team leader from Hebei who was assassinated on Foch Road the day before yesterday, hired a car himself after the incident and went to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment because Ge was shot in the leg during the assassination. Ge once served as an inspector of the former Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. At that time, there was a saying of the Four King Kongs among the inspectors, and Ge was also their team leader.

At around 10 a.m. the day before yesterday, a shooting incident occurred at the intersection of Foch Road and Weihaiwei Road, the boundary between the British and French concessions. Ge Shusen, the person who was shot, dodged quickly when he heard the gunshot and fell to the ground, thus escaping the disaster. At that time, three pedestrians were injured and two were killed by stray bullets, and the shooter was finally arrested. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to the reporter of Huawen News Agency, the reason for this shooting is that Ge's nickname is Ah San, he is 50 years old, a native of Hebei Province, illiterate, and very burly. He used to serve as an inspector in the Municipal Police Bureau. Recently, a certain party commissioned him to organize the "Special Service Third Brigade." Ge did his best to flatter him, so he was valued by his superiors. Ge acted as an accomplice to the tiger and summoned bandits to join the team in the name of expanding the team, but they had to bring guns and equipment with them. When the guns and equipment were in hand, they were disbanded. Those who resisted were subjected to various tortures. Therefore, many people were fooled, so they were extremely resentful and came up with this strategy to avenge themselves.

### Zhang Deqing, the Owner of Huanhua Iron Factory, Was Kidnapped Yesterday and Was Taken Away by Two Female Bandits in a Car and Disappeared

Huanhua Iron Factory is located at No. 364, Lane 1125, Yuyuan Road. The owner of the factory is named Zhang Deqing. The factory has a very thick capital and a considerable scale. Zhang's residence is in the French Concession. He must go to the factory every morning to work, and occasionally return home for lunch. Yesterday around noon at 12 o'clock, when Zhang was clearing debts in the factory and preparing lunch, more than a dozen male and female bandits suddenly rushed in with weapons and broke into Zhang's office. First, they drove and imprisoned all the staff in the room, and then two female bandits took out pistols and forced Zhang Deqing to follow them. Zhang had no choice but to let them do as they pleased. At that time, the two female bandits held Zhang on the left and right, went to the front of the factory gate, and made him enter a car parked on the side of the road and left. Afterwards, the factory urgently reported to the police station for assistance.

### Theft Cases Also Recorded

At No. 118, Pingliang Road, East Shanghai, at around 6:30 last night, two bandits suddenly came, one of whom was holding a pistol. They were forbidden to make a noise and searched arbitrarily. When the bandits escaped with the loot, they were followed by the victim behind. When they arrived at the post office, they reported the information, and the police rushed to arrest one of the bandits and intercepted a bag of clothes. The other bandit managed to escape without a trace.

A certain watch shop at No. 693, Macdonnell Road, was robbed of dozens of watches by three bandits, one of whom was holding a pistol, at 7:20 last night.

Two passers-by at No. 588, Rue Massenet, were stopped by five thugs who blocked their way at around 7:25 last night. After a thorough search, there was no loss.

Also, Dazhong Paper Store at No. 320 on the same road was robbed of 120 national currency by three bandits, one of whom was holding a pistol, who shouted and left at around 6:50 last night.

### The Group of Suicides

Zhang Yuanming, a local man from Shanghai, Zhang Yuanming, 23 years old, worked at the Deli Piano Factory in No. 54, Wulin Lane, Yulin Road, East Shanghai. Due to the large number of people in his family and the high prices of everything recently, he felt economic pressure. The night before last, he went to Dales Hotel at No. 8, Lane 640, Route Voyron, and lived there in seclusion. At 7 a.m. the next morning, he committed suicide by swallowing poisonous potion. After being discovered, an ambulance was called to take him to the Hudong Hospital for treatment.

A Tourist, Zhang, a 26-year-old man from Ningbo, a guest at No. 34, Sanjiang Hotel, Beihai Road, did not know how, but he had the idea of dying. He secretly swallowed poison and committed suicide at around 12:52 p.m. yesterday. After being discovered, he was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. It is said that his life is in danger.

Xu Zhaomei, Xu Zhaomei, a 19-year-old girl at No. 526, Connaught Road, swallowed raw opium and committed suicide at 3:05 p.m. yesterday due to family quarrels and unusual depression. Afterwards, she was taken to Tongren Hospital by family members for treatment by car.

Zhang Yuhe, Zhang Yuhe, a 44-year-old man from Hangzhou, has been unemployed for a long time and cannot maintain his livelihood. His clothes are ragged and he looks like a beggar.

### Social Miscellany

Gang Fight

Yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM, a large gang suddenly started fighting at the intersection of Rue Robert and Rue Pignan in western Shanghai. At the time, the two sides had a total of thirty to forty gangsters gathered, arranged in formations, each wielding lethal weapons such as iron rods, iron rulers, knives, and axes. Pedestrians, seeing this, fled in alarm. As a result, many people on both sides were injured. It is said that the gang fight was caused by a feud between local gangs and gangs from Jiangbei.

Apprentice Injured

Kang Zhicai, an apprentice at the Xinchang Machinery Factory located at 1212 Avenue Edward VII, a sixteen-year-old native of Ningbo, was working at around 2:30 PM yesterday when, due to a moment's carelessness, his body was caught in a machine belt, lifted into the air, and his chest and arms were crushed. He was later rescued by his companions and taken to the hospital for treatment.

### Zhu Qihui's Memorial Service Today

Mr. Zhu Qihui of Baoying, a member of a distinguished scholarly family, had resided in Shanghai for many years. Since the sudden outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, Mr. Zhu suffered from asthma and suddenly passed away. His eldest son, Yinyu, who was away from home on business at the time, rushed back upon hearing the news. Upholding his father's last wishes, the funeral arrangements were kept simple. The remains were temporarily placed at the Jiangning Guild Hall. Originally, it was planned to choose a date to escort the coffin back home for burial and mourning. However, as Baoying has fallen, there is no hope of returning for burial. Moreover, the second anniversary of his death is approaching, and the mourning period will soon be over. A memorial service will be held today (the 10th) in Kuling. All relatives and friends are expected to attend, making it a grand occasion.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: We have read in your newspaper's local news column on the 6th of this month a news item titled "Opium Paraphernalia Confiscated from the National Correspondence School." The content vaguely states that someone had privately set up an opium den at the Qifeng Chinese Painting Correspondence School at No. 443 and 445 Kangti Road, and that opium paraphernalia and a pot of opium paste were confiscated from the principal's office, and that a woman named Gu Tong from Anhui and others were arrested. We are extremely shocked. According to our school, which has been established for many years and has already been approved and registered by the education authorities, our school's family members and others conduct themselves with integrity. We have neither established an opium den nor have any bad habits. However, there are many tenants living in the same building, and it is possible that some of them may possess opium paraphernalia. As for the confiscation of opium paraphernalia from the principal's office, this is completely unfounded. This matter concerns the reputation of our school, so we are writing this letter to request that your newspaper grant us a correction in the "Letters to the Editor" column, so as to avoid confusion and rumors. This is our sincere request. Sincerely, The Qifeng Chinese Painting Correspondence School, December 9th.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong and this area will be sunny and cold with strong, biting northwesterly winds. The East China Sea will be sunny with strong, biting northerly to easterly winds. The center of the hurricane moved to within 120 miles of 16 degrees north latitude and 131 degrees east longitude yesterday afternoon, stopped moving forward, or deviated to the north to northeast. The wind force is unknown. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 62.6 degrees, and the lowest was 41.0 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 6.1 degrees, and the lowest was 51.0 degrees.

### Idle Funds Gather in Shanghai: Real Estate Transactions Active

The sale of the New World site in this city has become the largest real estate transaction of this year. However, according to the reporter's investigation, there was another large real estate transaction in the past, but because both parties kept it secret at the time, it was not noticed by the public. According to reports, the original site of the former Sofa Garden at the corner of Avenue Dubail and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, covering more than 20 mu of land, was sold to Anping Company by a British real estate company this autumn. According to recent news, the owner, in order to comply with the wishes of all sectors of society, has specially allocated a portion of the land to be developed into a high-end residential area, subdividing it into plots for sale. It is said that Wuhe Foreign Firm has been commissioned to design it, and construction will begin next spring along the road, building new-style city houses and apartments (see picture). The area is quiet and secure, and it is expected that there will be many buyers at that time. It can be seen that the completion of large real estate transactions will lead to many smaller transactions.

### Offense and Defense Inferior to the Enemy's Rampage: Tung Wah Suffers a Crushing Defeat to Westfords; Two Goals Scored with Difficulty in the Second Half; Zhuang Youren Absent Yesterday, Leaving the Defense Empty

Western Union Football League Group A, Tung Wah vs. Westfords, kicked off at Recreation Ground at 2:30 PM yesterday. The referee was Pei Nan. Impressed by Tung Wah's victory over the British team last week, no fewer than 3,000 spectators gathered on the north and south stands, making it extremely lively. However, Zhuang Youren, a key defender of Tung Wah, was unable to attend due to work commitments and was replaced by Hu Hanwen. Hu was less experienced and often had loopholes, which affected the overall situation. The Soviet army performed brilliantly, and the forwards were especially sharp, regaining their vigor from last year. They controlled the entire first half and won by five goals (the fourth goal was a penalty kick. When Duncan kicked the ball, Sipes was standing in the semicircle of the penalty area, which should have been invalid, because the rules stipulate that when taking a penalty kick, all players on both sides, except the kicker and the goalkeeper, should stand outside the penalty area and must be ten yards away from the penalty spot. This goal was ruled valid, and the referee was clearly negligent.) After changing sides, Wu Luo successively scored for Tung Wah, seemingly showing signs of revival, but it was only a flash in the pan. Sipes scored another goal, resulting in a 2-6 defeat for Tung Wah to Westfords. At the same time, the Tung Wah youth team played against East Seles at Zhendan, resulting in a 0-3 defeat for Tung Wah.

### Food: Can We End the People's Woe and Sorrow, And Let Hoarders Make a Fortune? Market Sits and Profits from Each Transaction, Small People Shed Blood and Tears for Every Unit of Grain, Prices Rise Without End

According to reports, the rice market opened early yesterday with about 14 or 15 trucks of goods arriving near the Suzhou-Jiading Road area. Sellers continued to hold back, refusing to show samples. As soon as inquiries were made, prices soared. Regardless of whether it was japonica or indica rice, the price was called up by more than two yuan in an instant, and ordinary japonica rice even reached nearly 49 yuan. The higher it was raised, the higher it went. The situation rebounded again at noon. This has been the consistent style of the rice market in recent days. A large number of transactions have already been completed, and hoarders are manipulating the market from selling to profiting. Only the working class suffers, struggling to buy a liter of rice with the sweat of their labor, watching helplessly as unscrupulous merchants freely manipulate the market and make a fortune without any prevention. In fact, as long as the arrivals are investigated from various import and export sources, all the rice that arrives is concentrated in the market, and purchased by various rice shops to meet market demand. The market price is determined publicly according to the quantity of arrivals and the needs of the market, and everyone must abide by it. It is absolutely forbidden to hoard rice in warehouses. If this method is followed, the price of rice can be stabilized immediately in a few days. On the one hand, thoroughly investigate the rice stored in various public and private warehouses, and on the other hand, investigate the fixed amount of foreign rice with various foreign firms, and order the rice industry to report the orders. Then, discuss the entire food management method. Even if the food situation in Shanghai cannot be restored to its previous state, there will eventually be a day of stability. How can we remain indifferent and inactive? At the close of the market yesterday, prices rose by half a yuan to nearly one yuan, regardless of japonica or indica rice. Special japonica rice from the Changbang area was 48 yuan, middle japonica rice was 46 to 47 yuan, and Saigon rice was 39 yuan and 38.5 yuan.

Early in the morning, Ke Xian rice soared in unison with other types of rice, rising by another one or two yuan compared to the previous market. It was then sold by floating profit-takers. Moreover, there were two full shipments of foreign rice, and Ke Xian rice has recently been arriving in Shanghai from the Jiangxi, Beijing, Wuhu, and Hankou areas, and raw rice is also being transported in an endless stream. Therefore, the market turned flat later in the day. However, it still rose by seven or eight cents compared to the previous day.

New foreign rice is difficult to allocate. Several previous telegrams have not been replied to, but most of the orders have been loaded. Yesterday, there were 25,000 bags being unloaded, and another 22,000 bags arrived in Pudong waiting to be unloaded. In the early morning, the spot market was once again manipulated and inflated by hoarders and speculators, and Saigon rice was once called up to 40 yuan. The result was 39 yuan. Relocated road cargo gradually became lively. Yesterday's total turnover was 745 tons, with prices ranging from 45.5 yuan to 46.1 yuan, all calculated by the original package.

Another 3,640 bags of newly arrived foreign rice arrived yesterday morning, transported from Rangoon by the Taikoo Company's New Beijing ship. It is said that the ship also carries a lot of foreign rice bound for North China, but the exact number is unknown.

### Speculative Trading Focused on Japanese Flour; Rumors of Soybean Control Again

The trend of flour yesterday was peaceful, because after repeated increases, actual sales gradually cleared. Some miscellaneous brands of flour have already been dumped in this street, so the turnover is less than 30,000 bags. The No. 2 flour factory's offer is temporarily stable. Returned goods, artillery powder, continued to open at 8.5 yuan, but at present, speculation is focused on trading Japanese flour because the factory's flour has been restricted and the warehouse list chips have long been exhausted. Therefore, the market for Phoenix brand flour and other flours fluctuates. The market opened at 8.3 yuan yesterday, and buyers were not greedy. As a result, it hovered around two cents. Today, 24,000 bags of flour were transported to Tianjin and 500 bags to Xiamen.

The source of wheat is still scarce, and the Shanghai stocks have been held by speculators, unwilling to release them, resulting in the market price repeatedly reaching new peaks. Only one truck was sold in the market yesterday, with the price opening at 13.65 yuan.

The soybean market was stable in the morning because the soybean oil market was stable, and the soybeans did not change much. With purchases from exporters and local buyers, the market price rose by two cents. A total of more than 3,000 bags of Wuhu soybeans were traded at a price of 17.6 yuan, three trucks of Nanjing soybeans were traded at a price of 17.15 yuan and 17 yuan, 300 to 400 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans were traded at a price of 18.3 yuan, 150 bags of Jiangbei soybeans were traded at a price of 16.43 yuan, and 500 bags of Chongming sand soybeans were traded at prices ranging from 18.1 yuan to 18.45 yuan. However, the situation changed dramatically in the afternoon. Rumors spread that goods that had not yet been unloaded were suddenly detained and that the place of origin was uniformly controlled. As a result, a sudden storm arose, and the undertow was huge. Sellers disappeared from the market, and even with a price increase of half a yuan, there was still a shortage of goods.

Yesterday, 120 bags of northern sand soybeans arrived, and today, 78 bags are being transported to Xiamen and 1,370 bags are being transported to Hong Kong. There are also 425 bags of raw kernels being transported to Hong Kong.

### Finance: Currency Market Ordinary

The foreign exchange market yesterday was stable. HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall. The informal market for British and American exchange rates was ordinary in the first half of the day, with occasional rises and falls, but the range was small. The course of the day was as follows: In the morning, the British pound was slightly softer, reported at 4 shillings 4.6875 pence, while the U.S. dollar was still reported at 7.28125 yuan. Later, because importers purchased futures for this month, and some profiteers also entered the market, the situation was stable and slightly softer. The U.S. dollar once tightened to 7.25 yuan. Fortunately, Hong Kong Electric sold out, and a Chinese bank also sold some, so the situation immediately returned to normal. Trading was even scarcer at noon, so it closed in a stable state. The British pound was at 4 shillings 4.84375 pence, and the U.S. dollar was at 7.28125 yuan, the same as the previous day. The trend of futures remained the same as the spot market.

Hong Kong Still Has Sales

At the beginning of the morning, the London big bars, near and distant futures, each fell by 0.1875, the New York silver price remained flat, the London raw gold was stagnant, and the exchange rates of British, American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The U.S. dollar was slightly lower than the British, Shanghai, and French currencies by 0.125. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 4 shillings 4.84375 pence for the British pound and 7.28125 yuan for the U.S. dollar. Compared with the previous close, the British pound tightened by 0.015625, while the U.S. dollar was neither good nor bad. After the opening, foreign firms first came to pull in, and foreign firms entered into a settlement for this month's spot British pounds at 4 shillings 4.6875 pence, and the situation was stable without change. Until HSBC's listed price was announced without change, the silver balance tax was announced down by a small amount. After that, a profit came to settle the spot US dollar in a certain bank at 7.28125 yuan and 25 yuan, and the market seemed to be slightly soft. But not long after, Hong Kong Electric suddenly came to sell the spot British pound to Hua Bi at 4 shillings and 4.84375 pence, and at that time, the Zhongxing Bank of China also came to sell the spot US dollar to Datong at 7.28125 yuan, so the process returned to normal. Transactions became clearer at noon, so the state became more stagnant. Until the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was 4 shillings and 4.84375 pence for the British pound, and 7.28125 yuan for the U.S. dollar. The British pound for this month was at 4 shillings and 4.6875 pence, and the U.S. dollar was at 7.25 yuan. The British pound for January was at 4 shillings and 4.375 pence, and the U.S. dollar was at 7.15625 yuan. As a result, there was no difference between the current period of British and American exchange rates compared with the day before yesterday. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

Hong Kong Exchange Rate Unchanged

Hong Kong, 9th: The currency market opened flat this morning. Exchange rates in various regions were neither good nor bad. At 11:05, the Shanghai Exchange spot rate rose slightly by one yuan to 332 yuan. At 11:30, it was stable without rising or falling. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

Tianjin British and American Currencies Lengthened

Tianjin, 9th: The currency market opened sluggishly this morning. The spot British exchange rate loosened by 0.125 to 4 pence 0.0625. The spot American exchange rate also lengthened by 0.25 to 6.5625 yuan. The Shanghai Exchange rate dropped slightly by half a yuan to 111 yuan. The informal market for "Joint Notes" rose slightly by 2.5 cents to 92.75 yuan.

### Cash Stagnation: Fluctuations Only a Few Dozen Yuan

Yesterday, the cash market was tepid and unclear. Due to the stagnation of foreign exchange, fluctuations were minimal, only rising and falling by about ten yuan. However, the underlying trend was firm. Although some money changers continued to release cash and some gold shops sold on behalf of speculators, the Hong Kong syndicate frequently commissioned certain silver shops to handle transactions, and the volume was considerable. Ultimately, the price rose by ten yuan, opening ten yuan higher at 4,180 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market softened slightly, coupled with purchases by certain securities firms and the Hong Kong syndicate, the price briefly rose to 4,200 yuan. However, the foreign exchange market suddenly reported a return to par, and the selling intentions of some money changers and gold shops intensified. Although the Hong Kong syndicate continued to buy, many general long positions also closed, making it difficult to match the supply. As a result, the price returned to 4,180 yuan at the noon close, the same as the morning opening. In the afternoon, the off-exchange trend continued to strengthen, as gold shops absorbed supply previously, and some money changers followed suit. It was rumored that the final price was 4,188 yuan, with over 2,000 taels traded during the half-day session. Silver shop jewelry was priced five yuan higher, while customs gold remained flat.

Tepid Market Rises Ten Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened quietly and firmly. At 9:35 AM, the market opened ten yuan higher, with money changers buying 50 taels from gold shops at 4,180 yuan. Subsequently, a silver shop bought on behalf of a client, raising the price by another ten yuan, with money changers trading ten taels at 4,190 yuan. At that time, securities firms released dozens of taels, and silver shops also sold, causing a drop of ten yuan. Securities firms sold 50 taels to gold shops at 4,180 yuan. Later, due to the steady and slightly soft foreign exchange market, some securities firms and others came to the market to buy. Soon, the Hong Kong syndicate commissioned a silver shop to buy again, raising the price by another twenty yuan, with securities firms buying 30 taels from other firms at 4,200 yuan. When the Hong Kong syndicate stopped buying, the price immediately fell. Gold shops and money changers mutually helped large clients to sell, and soon the price fell another twenty yuan, with gold shops selling twenty taels to money changers at 4,180 yuan. Later, a silver shop again bought on behalf of the Hong Kong syndicate, raising the price by ten yuan, with money changers buying twenty taels from securities firms at 4,190 yuan. At noon, securities firms continued to release supply, and at the same time, some gold shops and others were still willing to sell, so the silver shop suddenly gave up, quoting the price at 4,185 yuan. The silver shop then absorbed 160 taels from a gold shop and dozens of taels from retail investors. Later, as the Hong Kong syndicate was satisfied with its purchases, the price fell back by five yuan, with money changers mutually trading twenty taels at 4,180 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, the market rose by ten yuan compared to the previous day, with only a twenty yuan fluctuation in the half-day session. The selling price of cash gold shops was a few yuan higher than the tepid market, and the buying price was reduced by about twenty yuan. Spot gold was over fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions.

Jewelry Up Five Yuan

Silver shop jewelry was sold at 420 yuan per tael at the beginning, but at 9:50 AM, it was priced five yuan higher. There were no changes after that. As a result, the large shops changed the price to 425 yuan, the same as the new shops. The buying price was reduced by about fifteen yuan.

### Foreign Currency Shortage Remains

Yesterday, the demand for British and American gold pounds increased, and market prices were firm. The supply and demand for gold tickets were balanced, and British tickets remained stable. The evening price of American tickets was 13 yuan and 67 fen, only one fen lower than the previous night, indicating that the market price was not easy to fall. The supply of Hong Kong and French tickets was not smooth, and the demand for Annam tickets increased, with market prices firm. The supply of Canadian tickets was scarce, and market prices were high. The demand for Japanese gold tickets was not strong, and the market was slightly weak, with the evening price at 1 yuan, 2 jiao, 4 fen and 4 li. Korean tickets were also sluggish, with the evening price at 1 yuan, 1 jiao and 3 fen. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds both rose by one yuan, American gold tickets fell by one fen, Hong Kong and French tickets both rose by five li, Annam tickets rose by five fen, Canadian tickets rose by two jiao, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities: Foreign Stock Trading Remarkable, Domestic Bonds Stagnant

The securities market was even more stagnant yesterday, with most people remaining on the sidelines, both sides holding their positions and waiting for a change in the environment. The simplest observation at present is whether there will be a new agreement before the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty. This kind of future change is more important and is still in the brewing stage. Yesterday, Type Wu bonds were drawn, so the market transaction has been calculated excluding the lottery, which is one yuan more than those with the lottery. According to the price excluding the lottery the day before yesterday, it is still slightly better by five fen. Only Type Bing bonds had some transactions, and the rest were extremely rare. The market price still only had a difference of five fen and one jiao, with a transaction volume of more than 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Trading: A large number of Dada Shipping Company shares were traded, with 50 shares traded at a price of 36 yuan and 5 jiao.

The public market of the General Chamber of Commerce had remarkable transactions. In industrial stocks, whether belonging to the speculative or investment category, the buying power was extremely superior. International Trust, Yangtze Silver Company, Jardine Matheson, and Steel stocks all received new support and became active. Jardine Matheson Textile once rose to a high price of 26 and a half yuan. At the close, the price of Telephone stock was 21 yuan and 75, and there were buyers. Because of the world's low rubber reserves, there was a lack of supply, so many neglected stocks, especially Ximen Bu and Xue Na Wang, rose rapidly. At the close, all stocks had buyers.

London, August 8th: Today, the listed prices of British companies in the Far East have fallen slightly. The unnameable shares of Kaiping Coal Mine fell one shilling to seventeen shillings and six pence. The Gulag Kerin Bang Rubber shares fell six pence, remaining at twenty shillings and seven pence, and the rest remained unchanged.

London, August 8th: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remain stable, and there are no changes in the bonds at the top and bottom.

### Cotton Yarn: Local Cotton Trading Becomes More Lively, Profit-Taking and Reselling Slow Down the Rise, Tens of Thousands of Bales of American Cotton Purchased in Advance

Local cotton trading is still active, and factories are also actively purchasing, so transactions are becoming more and more frequent. Anda and Xinyu factories are absorbing the most, while others have not yet taken action. As for the market price level, it was originally intended to rise sharply, because some of the profits have been considerable, and there is a doctrine of holding out for sales to make money. As a result, the price increase has been slow. However, most of the industry is optimistic about the rise, with Fire Machine Flower expected to see 160 yuan, and Tong Flower to see 170 yuan. The selling price today is 167 and a half yuan for Tong Flower, which is two and a half yuan higher than the previous day. There are 3,130 bales of Tong Flower from Subei, 515 bales of Changyinsha Flower, and 5,684 bales of Beisha. The current cotton situation is as follows:

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market has been very firm recently. The US government's second change to export subsidies is generally expected to cause the market to fall. However, the market opened surprisingly well this morning, rising more than ten points again. Subsequently, due to good spot transactions and aggressive purchases by overseas cotton merchants, the cotton price was very stable. Although there was some profit-taking in the middle, the closing price rose six to seven points to more than ten points compared to the previous day. India also rose more than ten rupees, Egypt rose more than seventy points, and Liverpool rose more than twenty pence.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: The day before yesterday, in order to try to take advantage of the second reduction in export subsidies, American cotton was purchased in advance, hoping to get an export subsidy of 75 points. The total transaction was about tens of thousands of bales from all parties. In the future, American cotton may be weak, but according to rumors from various parties, because the US government's export subsidy fund is about to be exhausted, it is possible that the Secretary of Agriculture will petition the government to stop this only 40-point subsidy. The cotton market price yesterday, converted into factory prices at the US exchange rate of 7.25, is as follows: 20-count American Mid-ling 220.20; 20-count American Mid-ling lower grade 225.65; 32-count American Mid-ling 237.30; 32-count American Mid-ling lower grade 231.10; 42-count American Mid-ling 241.15; 42-count American Mid-ling lower grade 241.95.

The US Department of Agriculture announced that the amount of the sixth cotton production report this year is 11,792,000 bales, a decrease of 52,000 bales from the previous report.

### Guangdong Syndicate's Demand for Single Yarn Recovers, 20-Count Yarn Still Has Thick Inventory, Nothing More Than Being Driven Up by Raw Materials

The yarn market has seen price increases, because not only is it difficult for the overseas cotton market to loosen, but it is also seeing a slow pace forward. As a result, people unanimously expect prices to rise. At the same time, the demand from the Guangdong syndicate has recovered, and buyers and hoarders are even more excited. The market price is firm. However, it is found that the inventory of 10-count yarn is still thick, so the fundamental problem is nothing more than being driven up by raw materials. Factories cannot make profits based on the current cotton price, so they are unanimously dragging in, and the situation is becoming more lively.

When the yarn market opened in the morning, the industry gathered together, and the mood was particularly firm. Because the off-market trading had already seen an increase the day before yesterday, speculators, seeing the improved environment, were very active in buying. The opening price rose seven yuan, and the price of 20-count Double Horse was 718 yuan. Then, Yong'an Factory opened 150 bales of 20-count Special Jincheng, with a price of only 711 yuan, and the market was restrained again, falling back by two yuan. A little later, it was heard that the Hong Kong syndicate needed single yarn, and a speculator suddenly bought more than 100 bales, and the market suddenly became noisy, and the price rose steadily to 727 yuan. It was found that the half-day trading statistics were 2,830 bales. The price of 20-count Bianma rose 15 yuan, Double Earth rose 10 yuan, and Tiannv rose 10 yuan. 330 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong on the 10th, and 200 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount of purchases by each syndicate is listed on the left: Hong Kong 830; Same Industry 1,890; Mainland 70; Xiamen 40; Total 2,830.

### Sugar Market: Diaoqing Rises Two Yuan

Yesterday, the sugar market was tightest for domestic Diaoqing, with a total of 2,000 bags opened at a price of 30 yuan, up about two yuan.

The local market has seen particularly strong transactions, totaling more than 2,000 pieces. The Hong Kong syndicate has purchased more than 100 packages of coarse and fine twill. The Yong syndicate has purchased nearly 100 pieces of fine and coarse cloth. Overseas sales continue to be smooth, and the Nanyang syndicate purchases printed cloth endlessly. On the 10th, there were 81 pieces of piece goods shipped to Xiamen and 145 pieces shipped to Hong Kong.

### The Vigorous New Capital

— Ju Chen

Sichuan—Sichuan, whose land area is larger than the mainland of Japan, with its fertile soil, rich products, and superior position... Everyone knows that it is the base of our country's war of resistance; and the key to controlling this base is Ba County (i.e., Chongqing). In the past, Sichuan, apart from Chengdu, Ba County was actually the leader among the 146 counties in the province. In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the National Government moved into Bashu, and Chongqing became the new capital.

The Area is About to Increase Threefold

Chongqing was established as a city in May of this year (28th year). Its area is about 147 square kilometers. Recently, the suburbs have been incorporated into the city. The preliminary work of surveying the boundaries has been completed, and by the end of this year, the area of the city can be increased three times. With the expansion of the area, the budget will naturally also increase. This year's budget is more than 3 million yuan, and it is expected that the income will increase by 7 million yuan next year. Planning to Build a Ring Road Around the City

Although the Japanese planes are constantly flying back and forth, the government still allocated 10 million yuan to build a ring road around the city, which is expected to be completed in three years. Everyone knows that Chongqing is located on the delta where the Jialing River and the Yangtze River meet, and there is a saying that "there is no three feet of flat land," so it can be said to be a mountainous peninsula. Building roads is naturally doubly difficult. Some places near the valley also need to build 60-foot-high embankments. Therefore, only 30% of this 10 million yuan is used to purchase land, and 70% must be used for engineering, which shows the arduousness of the work and the unremitting spirit of the government authorities. As for transportation with the outside world, it can be said that it is accessible by water, land, and air. This is unnecessary to elaborate on.

The road construction plan is planned to be implemented in the first month of next year, because tax revenue can be increased at that time, and after the road is built, the value of the land will increase. It is also worthwhile to sell the excess land purchased at a low price now, so that the cost of road construction can be recovered. There are quite a few slums along the banks of the two rivers now. In the future, when the road is completed, buses and public buses (also some trams) will be speeding by, which will surely make people feel the vicissitudes of life.

Building Tunnels and Residential Areas

Another plan is to build underground tunnels connecting the downtown area and the southern area to avoid the current labor of detouring on the road. At the same time, it can also be used as an air-raid shelter for millions of yuan. If we start in three places, it will take about six months to complete.

According to the method of dispersing the population, it is planned to build affordable housing areas in the suburbs. The addresses have been selected in several places, and a loan of 3 million yuan has been obtained from the Bank of China as construction costs. In the first phase, it is planned to build four places first, followed by eight places. Each place has a park, a sports field, surrounded by shops and residences. These shops and residences may be built by the municipal government or by the people themselves.

Financial Budget and Population

Chongqing is now the center of transportation in the northwest and southwest, and ferries are also being improved. The population of the city was 500,000 before the bombing, but now it is only 380,000 due to evacuation. If it were not wartime, it could not become a special municipality. According to regulations, a special municipality must have a population of one million to be established and directly under the Executive Yuan.

This year's Chongqing budget is 3.3 million, 32.08% is used for public safety, 25.6% is used for public construction, 11% is used for education and social undertakings, and 31.32% is used for public health. Next year, we plan to add a little more to the education budget.

The vigorous new capital is like an oil pool, the more it is bombed, the more prosperous it becomes. The original Chongqing, "a leaf floating in the country of Ba, with two rivers floating around the Futu Pass," is actually the origin of our nation's "Chongqing" regeneration.

### Anecdotes of Life in the New Capital

— Ya Wen

If you come to the new capital and take a look, you will feel infinitely surprised; because the new capital in wartime, although it has been bombed repeatedly, has not only not become a ruin,

Instead, it is becoming more prosperous every day, and the people are showing a solemn and happy appearance. Everyone believes that the time for final victory is not far away. The cars flowing money on the road are endless. The bombed place is immediately covered with bungalows made of bamboo. The land price in the Yushi Street, Wuku Street, Doyou Street, and Quanggongju Street areas has risen to more than 700 yuan per square foot, and the landlord is still unwilling to let go. The goods in the store have everything they should have, as long as you can afford the price, any cosmetics, photographic materials, woolen tweed, canned food, can be bought at will.

Clothing: The clothing of the new urban residents is very simple. The most fashionable for women is to wear cheongsams with blue cloth faces, and Ann Ann blue cloth is in short supply on the face of the new capital. Ordinary men mostly like to wear cloth Zhongshan suits. The labor cost of tailor shops is very expensive. An ordinary three-piece suit, excluding the woolen material, costs no less than 30 yuan in wages; therefore, there are not as many people wearing suits as in Shanghai. Male and female students all wear the prescribed uniforms and walk on the street, which is very neat. Noble women in the new capital do not wear high-heeled leather shoes, because the municipal government stipulates that prostitutes only wear high-heeled leather shoes, so no one is willing to imitate.

Food: In terms of food, in addition to Sichuan restaurants, all other types of restaurants are available. Cantonese cuisine such as Dasanyuan and Guanshengyuan; Suzhou cuisine such as Songhelou, Northern cuisine such as Yanshi Restaurant, Ningbo cuisine with Siming Night Snack Restaurant, Yangzhou cuisine with Slender West Lake, and several Nanjing cuisine restaurants such as Guotai. None of them are not thriving. Every night when the lights come on, there is always no space, spitting out a batch of people and swallowing another batch of people. Although there are also several Western restaurants, the taste is not as good as Shanghai because the production of fresh fish is not high and the refining of cream is not very effective. Several new Russian restaurants have recently opened. A small pot of borscht, slightly served with bread, does not cost much, and can fill the stomach, so many people tend to go there, and the business is quite good.

Transportation: Although the roads in the new capital are not as wide as those in Shanghai, pedestrians can abide by the rules of walking, so although the narrow road is full of pedestrians, there will never be any crowding or conflicts. Especially during gatherings, the masses abide by order, file in, and there is no sound of rushing or shouting. This point has aroused the admiration of foreigners.

Hygiene: The locals in the new capital have a Ni Zan-like cleanliness. There are more bathrooms in the city than in other places, and ordinary bathrooms are equipped with places to receive women, as well as so-called family bathrooms. Ordinary families take their families to bathe together. The bathing fee is calculated by time, ranging from one to two yuan per hour. Now the municipal government is afraid that some people will bring prostitutes to pretend to be family members to take a bath, and for the sake of maintaining customs, it has ordered those who run bathhouses to separate men's and women's bathrooms, not to allow them to bathe together again, and not to allow them to stay overnight.

Foreigners: There are recently more than 360 foreign nationals in the new capital (excluding the Navy), with women accounting for one-third. Most of them are embassy staff and missionaries. The rest are representatives of commercial operations. Since the outbreak of the war with Germany, British, German, and French expatriates have been talking about the news of the war in their home countries in cafes, and they are ready to return to serve their countries at any time.

Air Defense: The air defense deployment in the new capital is extremely thorough. Many new air-raid shelters have been dug, divided into three major areas: the urban area, Jiangbei, and Nan'an, with a total of more than 500 air-raid shelters, which can accommodate more than 60,000 people. In the event of an air raid, the air defense headquarters will issue an alarm with electric sirens, and the people will not panic when they hear the alarm. They will enter the shelter together, and some will carry books and read without stopping in the light of kerosene lamps or flashlights in the air-raid shelter. The calmness of their attitude can be seen.

### Chongqing's Products and Commerce

— Shao Tang

Chongqing does not produce much rice, and mostly relies on the supply of neighboring counties. The output of miscellaneous grains such as potatoes, corn, peanuts, sesame and various beans is extremely rich, especially beans, because the climate is earlier than the lower Yangtze River. Even in the winter season, fresh beans can be eaten. In addition, the output of livestock such as chickens and ducks and fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, pears, etc. is also extremely rich. The development of mineral products is very small. Coal is the main product extracted from the nearby mountains; in Shiyougou, Nan'an, there is natural outflow of petroleum that can be used.

The most famous factory is the improved silk factory run by the Sichuan Silk Industry Institute. There are more than 4,000 looms in the city. There is a cement factory in Nan'an with a very large scale, and its output is sufficient for the entire Sichuan province. The bleached bristles produced by the Chuanyu Pig Bristle Factory are sold in Europe and the United States and are especially famous. Since the War of Resistance, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a total of more than 340 factories have moved from Shanghai and Wuhan to the inland, including about 150 machinery and hardware industries, more than 20 electrical and radio industries, about 40 chemical industries, about 10 ceramic and glass industries, about 20 food and beverage industries, 60 textile industries, and more than 40 printing industries. Among them, four-tenths have been moved to Sichuan Province, and some of them have already started construction in Chongqing. There are four yarn factories, namely Qingxin, Yuhua, Yufeng, and Dacheng. According to the industry, there are currently more than 50,000 yarn factories in Chongqing. The main export commodities are tung oil, raw silk, medicinal materials, pig bristles, cow leather, and sheepskin, while the main import commodities are piece goods, cotton yarn, hardware, Soviet goods, and pigments. Among the export commodities, tung oil is the most famous, accounting for the first place in my country's export commodities. In addition to the Juxingcheng Zhongzhongjiaonong four banks, Shanghai Bank and Zhejiang Xingye Bank also have branches. Financial activities are lively, and the atmosphere is new every day.

### Transportation in Chongqing

Because Chongqing is surrounded by water on three sides, water transportation is convenient. Foreign ships navigating the Yangtze River westward have always used this as their terminal. Before the war, the two giant ships, "Minyuan" and "Minben," operated by Mr. Lu Zuofu of Sichuan, sailed directly from Chongqing to Shanghai, taking only ten days downstream and no more than two weeks upstream. Due to the current war situation, downstream navigation only reaches Yichang, while upstream navigation reaches Jiading, and northward navigation reaches Hechuan. In addition, there are small steamers traveling to various locations, such as the Yu-Fu Line from Chongqing to Fuling, the Yu-Mu Line from Chongqing to Mudong, the Yu-Song Line from Chongqing to Songgai, the Yu-Wen Line from Chongqing to Wenquan, and the Yu-Ci Line from Chongqing to Ciqikou. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is currently under construction but not yet open to traffic. The main highways are divided into westward and southward lines. The westward line runs directly from Chongqing to Chengdu, totaling 450 kilometers, and connects to the northwest highway. The southward line runs directly to Guiyang, totaling 488 kilometers. In addition, there is the Yu-Yuan Highway from Chongqing to Yuanling in Hunan, totaling 993 kilometers, but it is not yet fully open to traffic. There is also a short-distance bus service from Chongqing to Ciqikou, called the Yu-Ci Line. On the Chongqing-Guiyang section, there is also the Haitangxi-Wenquan branch line from Haitangxi in Chongqing to Wenquan. On the Chongqing-Chengdu section, there is also the Qingmuguan-Beibei branch line from Qingmuguan in Chongqing to Beibei. Public buses operated by bus companies run within the city, divided into four routes. One route runs between Zengjiayan and Guojielou, one route runs between Tongjielou and Caiyuanba, one route runs between Daxigou and Hualongqiao, and one route runs between Xiaoshizi and Shangqingsi. The stations along this route were originally part of the first route, but due to the excessive number of passengers on the first route, the fourth route was added to reduce congestion. For commercial aviation, there are two major companies, China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation, both with regular scheduled flights. China National Aviation Corporation flies to Guilin, Hong Kong, Guiyang, Hanoi, Kunming, Luzhou, Xufu, Jiading, Wanxian, Yichang, and Chengdu. Eurasia Aviation Corporation flies to Guilin, Kunming, Hanoi, Chengdu, Hanzhong, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Ningxia, Liangzhou, and Xining. Postal services are under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Sichuan Administration Bureau, with a total of twelve branches distributed throughout the city, in addition to the General Bureau. The telegraph service has now been expanded to form the Sichuan-Kang-Tibet Telegraph Administration Bureau, with an average daily volume of over 1,800 telegrams sent and received, and approximately 7,000 telegrams relayed. International telegrams are usually transmitted via radio or submarine cable, and domestic telegrams are also often transmitted via radio due to line issues. For long-distance calls, in addition to military use,

the Great Buddha by the Jialing River can directly communicate with Chengdu, Shiyang, Neijiang, Jiajiang, Leshan, Qijiang, Wanxian, Liangshan, Changshou, Badong, Dianjiang, Fengjie, Nanwenquan, Kunming, Hong Kong, and other places. This spring, trial wireless telephone calls were also made with Dihua in Xinjiang and Lanzhou in Gansu, with good results, and it is expected that they will be open to the public soon.

### Salt Wells in Chongqing

— Huanlan

There is a common saying: "The seven necessities to begin a day are firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea." Although salt ranks fourth, its importance is no less than that of firewood, rice, or oil. Because everyone needs it, salt tax is a very important item in the national revenue.

Salt includes rock salt, lake salt, and well salt. Sichuan's salt comes from wells, called well salt. A few years ago, there were twenty-three salt fields in the province engaged in production. Statistics show that there were more than 8,800 salt wells, and there are many near Chongqing. Because the brine quality of well salt is weak, on average, evaporating about 20 jin of water is required to produce 1 jin of salt. At a time when fuel is expensive, the cost is also high. According to a report at the end of November this year, a certain chemical industry society introduced the Shinoda drying method from France and Germany and built drying racks, which were tested at the Niuhuaxi salt field with excellent results. This method can save fuel and allow for natural evaporation. It is said that each drying rack costs three to four thousand yuan, but if implemented throughout the province, it could save ten million yuan in fuel costs.

The picture shows a salt well in Chongqing. The wooden frame and wheel disc are the pulleys used to extract brine, which, as physics explains, use fulcrums to reduce labor.

### A Brief Record of Chongqing

— Shaotang

Chongqing is located at 106 degrees 37 minutes 48 seconds east longitude and 29 degrees 35 minutes 10 seconds north latitude, with an elevation of 240 feet. It is situated at the confluence of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River, surrounded by water on three sides and connected to land on one side. Strategists consider it a crucial point for both water and land routes, controlling Jing and Kui to the east, pointing to Chengdu to the west, leading to Qian and Dian to the south, and looking to Hanzhong to the north, making its terrain extremely important. In the Zhou Dynasty, it was the State of Ba, with a viscount of the Ji surname. During the Qin and Han dynasties, it was the territory of Ba Commandery. In the Jin Dynasty, it was renamed Badu. At the beginning of the Sui Dynasty, it was renamed Yuzhou. During the reign of Emperor Yang, it was renamed Yu Commandery. In the Tang Dynasty, it was renamed Yuzhou again. It was not until the reign of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song Dynasty that it was renamed Chongqing Prefecture. During the Yuan Dynasty, it was established as Chongqing Circuit. In the Ming Dynasty, it was renamed Chongqing Prefecture again, and this continued in the Qing Dynasty. In the early years of the Republic of China, the prefecture was abolished and replaced by a county. In the twenty-fifth year, a city was established. In the twenty-eighth year, it was changed to a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan of the National Government. The total area of the city is 174 square kilometers. In the sixteenth year of Guangxu (Qing Dynasty), it was permitted as a treaty port due to the Sino-British Beijing Additional Treaty. In the twentieth year of Guangxu (Qing Dynasty), the Treaty of Shimonoseki with Japan designated it as a commercial port.

### Scenic Spots in Chongqing

— Shaotang

Chongqing is surrounded by mountains and rivers, with many scenic spots. The most famous are the North and South Hot Springs. The South Hot Spring is about 40 li from the city. The water source comes from Jianyu Mountain, and the temperature is constantly maintained at 44 degrees Fahrenheit. It contains a lot of sulfur, so it can treat various skin diseases. In addition to the main spring, there are two small springs, one called Ziquan, located in Juewen Garden behind the hot spring resort. The water volume is very small and is not open to the public. The other is called Xiaowenquan, located on the left bank of Huatanxi Creek, about 3 li from the hot spring resort. The North Hot Spring is located in Wentang Gorge downstream of the Jialing River, 140 li by water from Chongqing. The land route is slightly shorter than the water route, only 79.5 kilometers. Tourists can take a bus from Qingmuguan to Beibei if traveling by land, and then take a tourist boat from Beibei Hot Spring Park to directly reach the North Hot Spring. The spring water emerges from the foothills in three streams. The temperature is slightly lower than that of the South Hot Spring, warmer in winter and cooler in summer, unlike the constant temperature of the South Hot Spring throughout the year. According to the chemical analysis results of the Western China Academy of Sciences, the highest temperature of the North Spring is around 37 degrees Celsius. The mineral content, especially lime, is slightly higher, but it can also treat skin diseases. Famous scenic spots near the South Hot Spring include Jianwen Peak. Legend has it that Emperor Jianwen of the Ming Dynasty once hid on this peak. There was originally a Jianwen Temple on the mountain peak, but it has been in disrepair for many years; most of the buildings in the temple have collapsed. Near the North Hot Spring is Gaokeng Rock, where waterfalls fly across. It is over a hundred feet high and nearly two hundred feet wide. People cannot approach within three zhang, making it the most magnificent scenery near the North Hot Spring. In addition, there are also the Twelve Scenic Spots of Bayu, such as Jinbi Liushui and Hongya Dicui, as well as gardens, villas, caves, temples, and other famous scenic spots, too numerous to mention, so they are omitted here.

### Wartime Work of Women in Chongqing—A Spirit of Service Exceeding That of Men—

— Xinmeng

In the streets of Chongqing, one can often see teams of Chinese girls with sun-darkened faces and skin, singing military songs, with blankets and other items on their backs, marching in orderly steps. Under the leadership of Madame Chiang, their lives are disciplined and militarized. Among these women, 450 are from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The youngest is only fourteen years old, but she claimed to be fifteen in order to join the Women's Wartime Service Corps. They received military training in Hunan, and now, under the leadership of Madame Chiang, they are engaged in various wartime tasks. In the rear, they are responsible for teaching elementary school students how to sing military songs and how to take precautions during air raids, as well as participating in public gatherings,慰劳征人家庭, and improving relations between the people and the military.

On May 3rd and 4th, Chongqing suffered a brutal bombing by Japanese aircraft, resulting in a total of 5,000 deaths and 1,000 injuries. They participated in various rescue efforts, demonstrating a spirit of service that exceeded that of men. At the same time, near Chongqing, Madame Chiang established a New Life Textile Factory, planning to recruit 1,000 wives and daughters of servicemen, so that they would each have work. Initially, it is half-work and half-study, teaching not only textile skills but also subjects such as music, language, and arithmetic. After graduation, they implement cooperation and can purchase textile machines at half price, with installment payments. Military families can enjoy special discounts when purchasing goods from the factory.

Since the successive fall of Hankou and Guangzhou, at least 10,000 war orphans rescued from the war zones have been brought to Chongqing. The work of relief and education is entirely carried out by women's organizations. Currently, there are many women's organizations in Chongqing, but they are all unified and commanded by the highest women's movement organ. The weather is getting cold, and servicemen urgently need winter clothing, so recently, women in Chongqing have been busy sewing winter clothes. Under the leadership of Madame Chiang, considerable achievements were made in this work in Hankou, so this time it will naturally be no less impressive.

### Random Notes on Chongqing

Since the establishment of the Chongqing Municipal Price Assessment Committee, it has been stipulated that the prices in Chongqing shall be based on the market prices on November 2nd of this year, and no increase shall be allowed thereafter. The standard price for high-quality rice is 16 yuan per dan, and the standard price for vegetable oil is 6.6 jiao per jin.

According to a survey by a foreigner named Stein in August of this year, 386 factories that had relocated from Shanghai and Hankou to the vicinity of Chongqing had 65,000 tons of machinery.

On the 9th of this month, the Ministry of Education promoted social education work. In addition to establishing a wartime social education work corps to provide services everywhere, there are over 1,000 students in civilian schools and over 600 students in women's supplementary schools.

The largest air-raid shelter in the country is in Chongqing, capable of accommodating 10,000 people and equipped with air pumps and generators, etc.

The beggars in Chongqing have all been taken in and given military training.

There are twelve scenic spots and historical sites in Chongqing: Central Park, General's Tomb, Luohan Temple, Jiangbei Park, Liyuan Garden, Laojun Cave, Zhenwu Mountain, Nanshan Mountain, Huayan Temple, Laoying Rock, South Hot Spring, and North Hot Spring, etc.

### Four New Ministers

— Guanqing

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was recently held in Xindu, Chongqing. Regarding party affairs, four new ministers were appointed. One is the new Minister of Publicity, Mr. Wang Shijie, a native of Hubei, currently 48 years old. He graduated from Beiyang University at an early age and then went to the University of London in the United Kingdom to study economics, education, and political science. Later, he went to the University of Paris in France to study law and obtained a doctorate. After returning to China, he was hired as a professor of constitutional law at Peking University. In 1928, the Ministry of Education hired him as the president of National Wuhan University. He was serious in his work and was deeply appreciated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The following year, he became the Minister of Education. The academic community admired him for his integrity and hard work. He is the author of books such as "Comparative Constitutional Law" and "Chinese Slavery." In his youth, he was intelligent and diligent in his studies. During his studies abroad, various Western professors praised him for his quick thinking and studiousness. He is amiable and approachable, and he has been known for his integrity in politics and education.

The second is the new Minister of Organization, Mr. Zhu Jiahua, courtesy name Liuxian, currently 47 years old, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang, with a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Berlin, Germany. After returning to China, he served as a professor at Peking University, Sun Yat-sen University, and National Central University, as well as a member of the Guangdong Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Minister of Education, Minister of Communications, and Chairman of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board of Directors (currently still in office). Mr. Zhu was handsome, erudite, eloquent, responsible, and public-spirited in his youth, and he is a cornerstone of China's young politicians.

The third is the new Minister of Social Affairs, Mr. Wu Tiecheng, a typical soldier and scholar, currently 51 years old, a native of Zhongshan County, Guangdong, born in Jiangxi. He studied in Japan at an early age and was a successful protégé of the Prime Minister. He served as a representative of Jiangxi Province to the National Congress in Nanjing and as a consultant to the Prime Minister. He then served as the Director of the Guangdong Public Security Bureau and Commander of the Military Police. His subordinates were known for their bravery, and were later reorganized into the 17th Division of the National Revolutionary Army. Later, he served as a member of the Central Legislative Yuan and Mayor of Shanghai. When the War of Resistance broke out, he was transferred to serve as the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government. He is good at socializing and is enthusiastic about public welfare and charity. He is tall and has a bold demeanor. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek appreciates him as a versatile and artistic figure.

The fourth is the new Minister of Social Affairs, Mr. Gu Zhenggang, a native of Guizhou. He is very enthusiastic about party affairs and is courageous and responsible in his work. He has served as an alternate member of the Central Executive Committee, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department, and Counselor of the Ministry of Industry. Mr. Gu is honest and hardworking in politics. He is unwilling to let others take the lead in any undertaking that benefits the party, the country, and the people, so the central government relies heavily on him.

### The Fog in Chongqing is Worth 30 Million

Once Chongqing enters winter, it is shrouded in fog, which lasts until the early summer of the following year before clearing up. This fog has its disadvantages and advantages. The disadvantage is that when there is heavy fog, there is no sun, and the climate is very bad, making people feel extremely uncomfortable in such an environment. The advantage is that with fog, planes can easily get lost and are also afraid of hitting the surrounding high mountains, which could cause them to crash. Therefore, once winter arrives, there are not many Japanese bombers going to Chongqing. This is a natural weapon against air raids. When Senator Tao Xingzhi gave a speech in Hong Kong this spring, he said, "The fog in Chongqing is worth 30 million." His explanation was: To make Chongqing's air defense comprehensive, at least 100 anti-aircraft guns are needed, and if each gun costs 300,000, then 30 million would be needed. Once Chongqing has fog, the Japanese dare not bomb, so isn't the fog in Chongqing worth 30 million?

### Film and Drama in Chongqing

— Yingdai

Due to the war, several film companies moved from Shanghai to Nanjing, and then from Hankou to Chongqing. Famous movie stars of the past have now joined the Chinese spiritual mobilization, reducing their lifestyles to the bare minimum in terms of clothing and food. Actresses playing leading roles currently receive only 60 yuan per month for living expenses. They are extremely busy with various preparations, but they don't seem to care much about the salary. According to locals, the lighting in Chongqing is very bad, and film production sometimes comes to a standstill because of it. It is even said that dogs in Sichuan are terrified and bark wildly when they see the sun in Chongqing, so you can imagine that sometimes it is impossible to film because of the light.

However, some movie stars cherish their time very much, and even if they are not filming movies, they will use their spare time to do some work. Especially those who have performed in stage plays in the past join legitimate theater troupes and perform wartime dramas in Chongqing and neighboring towns to awaken the general public. Currently, there are many theater groups in Chongqing—professional, amateur, and organized by young students—all standing on the same front line to perform national salvation dramas and engage in theater movements, working quite hard, so there is almost always a theater group performing every day.

Since the outbreak of the European war, foreign exchange has gradually tightened, and not only has the supply of photography materials decreased, but the price has also become very expensive, which has greatly increased the cost of filmmaking. However, film companies in Chongqing, especially "China Film" and "Central Film," are actively proceeding with filmmaking. All the films they shoot contain a sense of resistance. Currently, the films shown in large and small cities in southwestern China are all of this kind. Here, it is not difficult to see that the film and drama movement in Chongqing is being vigorously promoted!

### The Problem of Children's Crime

— Qiulang

Since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai, known as an isolated island, has produced many war orphans. Although they are taken in and cared for by various charities, the number is too large to accommodate. Therefore, one can see wandering children everywhere in the streets and alleys. These poor children, some still have parents, but they became separated from their homes after the upheaval and scattered along the way. Some don't even have parents. Their lives are so miserable! Every day they wander the streets, scavenging, begging, and even committing theft. The wandering children who commit theft are certainly committing crimes, but because of their young age and lack of knowledge, and because they are under the legal age, the law usually deals with them leniently on the grounds of youth and ignorance.

However, the situation in the "History of Crime by Street Children" recently published in this newspaper is different. According to what was published the other day: "Shanghai street child Lin Meiyuan, thirteen years old, recently stole valuable items on Nanjing Road and was arrested and sent to court. The judge, considering that the child was young, transferred him to the Children's Protection Section of the Public Works Department. According to the child's own statement: his uncle Lin Changchun brought him to Shanghai from Duobo and taught him how to steal. He had to steal items, and the uncle sold them and spent the money himself. Sometimes when he didn't want to steal, his uncle would beat him until he submitted." This is truly outrageous! The child Lin knew that stealing was a criminal act and did not want to do it, but this rogue uncle insisted on instigating him, beating and coercing him for his own gain. The commission of this crime was entirely caused by the rogue uncle, who should be arrested and severely punished! And this child Lin is innocent by nature and capable of being reformed!

Stealing is an immoral and criminal act, let alone teaching ignorant children to embark on a path of crime, while oneself remains free from the law. This is an extremely heinous crime! However, there are adults in society who steal, and children learn from them. There are not many children like Lin who can awaken themselves and distinguish between good and evil. It is hoped that those responsible for society will guide children with pure natures onto the right path from an early age, so as to prevent them from becoming evildoers as adults and leading others to do the same.

### Common Sense Questions and Answers

— Chen Zhijun

Q: Why does the bitten area of peaches and pears turn yellowish-brown?

(A) Peaches, pears, and other fruits contain a lot of iron. After we bite off the skin, the iron comes into contact with the air and undergoes oxidation, thus changing color.

(Q) Why does hot water clean better than cold water when washing clothes?

(A) Particles of dirt often stick to clothes and skin with a film of oil. Hot water can soften and dissolve this film of oil in the water, making it cleaner.

(Q) Why does river water flow slower on both sides than in the center?

(A) The water on both sides is slowed down by the resistance of sand and soil on the banks. The water in the center has less resistance, so it flows faster.

(Q) Why does the sun appear larger in the morning and smaller at noon?

(A) In the morning, sunlight shines on the ground at a shallow angle, passing through a very thick layer of air before reaching the eyes. The light is no longer very strong. When our eyes receive this light, the pupils do not need to contract, so they appear larger. At noon, the sun shines directly on the horizon, and the layer of air it passes through is thinner than in the morning. The light shining on the ground is very strong. Our pupils must contract to receive this light, and after the pupils contract, things appear smaller. However, for everyday objects, because of visual perception, the pupils contract the same amount regardless of distance.

(Q) Why do flowers smell sweeter after rain?

(A) There are two reasons: (1) After it rains, the air is fresh, and the fragrance is noticeably stronger.

(2) After it rains, the pores in the flowers that release fragrance are washed clean, allowing them to release more fragrance, so flowers smell sweeter after rain.

(Q) Why do we still have to exert force when swallowing food?

(A) There is air in the stomach, and swallowing requires overcoming its pressure, so exertion is needed.

### Wildfire—Ming'er's Refugee Diary, Part 46—

— Baizheng

Watching the sun rise gradually from the mountain crevice in the east and slowly sink behind the hills in the west, another day passed like this. Sleeping and eating, eating and sleeping, wasting the days away in a daze. The climate also changed from warm to warm with the days, indicating that winter was passing and spring was coming. The organisms on the ground, brewing their new lives from the dead corpses, slightly awakened and showed a glimmer of life.

Mountain peaks, the ground, among the hills, by the streams, everywhere there were remnants of tangled and withered weeds, dead branches, barren rice stalks, and withered old leaves. How pitiful! These relics of nature were not collected. Some decayed, others were trampled, all a desolate scene.

After this long winter, spring finally came. The withered grass and fallen leaves could not rot completely, nor could they be trampled all away; they still densely covered the earth, seemingly wanting to last forever, remaining in the vast wilderness. But as winter passed and spring came, their descendants grew again, but they were squeezed by the remnants, unable to move freely, giving their descendants a blow to their lives. The people in the village seemed to understand this very well. Naturally, when this time came, no one went into the mountains to chop firewood anymore, forming an unwritten law. If these tens of thousands of withered grasses were allowed to lie crisscrossed, and new grass grew on top of them in the future, it would hinder the fields they cultivated. If all these grasses were cut away, it would be no easy task. Therefore, during this lean time, there was a grand burning of the mountains.

In recent days, one could find posters plastered on the walls of the village's ancestral hall: Banning the burning of mountains, one is to protect trees, and the other is to reveal the targets of aircraft bombing. But let the posters be posted, the mountains cannot but be burned. This kind of lip service leaves people helpless.

It was a pitch-black night. Just after Ming'er's family finished dinner, they discovered a ball of blazing light at the foot of the mountain opposite their house, like a ball of fire rolling around in the surrounding darkness, appearing particularly dazzling. The ball of fire gradually rolled towards the mountainside, and its area also expanded. Sparks flew in all directions, and the tongues of fire licked the ground, blood-red, licking at what it wanted to devour. The light flickered, eliminating the darkness without a trace, recklessly doing what it wanted within its sphere of influence. The withered grass had already been dried by the wind and sun and was extremely dry. All it took was a spark to ignite it. A wisp of white smoke and flames transformed its withered yellow original appearance into a pile of black ashes, and a gust of wind drove it away to who knows where. The flames spread more violently, and the tongues of fire had an endless ambition, desperately expanding to the places nearby. The crackling of trees, the burning of weeds, and the roaring of flames, along with the shouting of the east wind, formed a symphony of nature. The flames devoured this large area of withered grass like a wild bull. It even spread to and set fire to a small hill. A bright glow illuminated Ming'er, who was standing in the house watching, very brightly, but the wildfire was still unstoppable, but in the end, it had its dead end. Soon it was extinguished.

The foot of the mountain became a scorched earth, seemingly having been baptized by artillery fire. Ming'er remotely thought of that beautiful land! He couldn't help but feel a burst of melancholy! The flames of aggression will eventually be extinguished! And new life can still be built from the scorched earth!

### The Donkey and the Nightingale

— Krylov's Fable — Translated by Zhao Yilin

One day, a donkey saw a nightingale. He said to the nightingale, "My dear, listen to me: they say you sing very well, and I have long wanted to hear you sing, to see if what you sing is as good as they say?" The nightingale, hearing this, began to sing. It sang in various tones, melodious and harmonious, moving from one song to another. At one moment, the sound was extremely low, and the distant reeds echoed softly; at another, a delicate melody scattered through the forest, and almost everyone listened to these songs. A breeze blew, and the birds stopped; the cows lay down in the grass. The shepherd boy, listening to the song, also held his breath, smiling at the shepherdess as he listened.

Finally, the song stopped. Then the donkey bowed its head to the ground and criticized, "I found it very unpleasant to listen to! To be honest, no one who hears your singing will not feel tired. It's a pity you haven't heard our rooster crow; if you learned from the rooster, you could sing better..."

The nightingale, hearing this, ignored him and had already flown far away.

### The Blue Dwarf (11)

— Ai Li

The dwarf, seeing that Ali had nothing to say, said again, "Dinner is ready, and they are waiting?" Ali turned around and saw a house over there, much larger than the others, its height just enough for her to bend over and enter. When she looked into the house through the window, she saw a long table, covered with a light blue cloth, on which were placed many delicate plates, and next to the plates were a knife, a fork, and a small blue glass. At both ends of the table were two large plates, steaming with a wonderful aroma, which wafted out of the window. Ali smelled the aroma and thought, "I don't feel hungry, but since they have invited me to eat, I might as well accept their hospitality, but I hope they don't ask me to eat pine nuts from the pine trees." The dwarf seemed to know what she meant and said, "They will definitely prepare something good for you to eat." Then he let out a sharp whistle, breaking the silence, and in an instant, the dwarfs in the whole village appeared before her eyes as if by magic, rushing into the house, but as soon as they entered the corridor, they stood on both sides, leaving a path in the middle. The dwarf from before bowed very politely and said, "Please come in."

Ali asked happily, "Do you all gather together like this when you have dinner? How interesting!" The dwarf replied, "Not always, only for public banquets. Please come in and sit down, girl." Ali then stopped speaking, lowered her head, and carefully prepared to enter the door, but suddenly, she heard another sharp whistle, which startled her. She looked up, but bumped hard into the lintel with a bang, which hurt terribly. Immediately, she was annoyed and shouted, "What—what's going on? Why did you whistle again for no reason, startling me? I—" She had no more to say. The sound of the whistle came again, waking Ali up; she had been dreaming.

Ali was dubious, not knowing whether she was awake or dreaming. She stared around, seeing only darkness, her body stiff and cold, and her head still throbbing, because she had just bumped into the old tree trunk. She composed herself, and then heard the sound of a whistle in the distance; it was the early-rising bird starting to sing. The dwarf's whistle that she had heard in her dream was actually the bird's call.

She sobbed to herself, "Oh! Oh! What am I going to do? Where is my body? How can I find my way back in this darkness? Oh, I know, it must be those blue dwarfs playing tricks and making fun of me, making me believe I am dreaming. I knew those dwarfs were also monsters; I shouldn't have followed them to the village." Then she sat quietly for several more minutes, half-asleep, half-awake, still crouching next to the old tree, as if wanting it to protect her. After more time had passed, her consciousness gradually returned, and she thought that sitting still was not a solution; she had to find a way to return to the small inn, thinking that her uncle and aunt were worrying about her, not knowing where she had gotten lost. Thinking of this, she almost burst into tears.

Poor Ali finally struggled to stand up, then remembered the book and umbrella she had brought. She reached out and felt the ground, and they were still by the tree. She hurriedly picked them up, tucked them under her arm, and staggered a few steps forward, thinking that if she walked out of the shade of the trees, it wouldn't be so dark. This did not disappoint her; after she moved away from the old tree, she did feel a little brighter, but the night was still dark, and she could not see a glimmer of dawn. In such darkness, finding a way out of the forest was not easy; she regretted having rashly entered the forest in the first place.

### Searching for the Orphan and Saving the Orphan (Part 1)

— Su Shaoqing

"The Eight Righteousnesses" depicts the history of the rise and fall of the Zhao family of the Jin Kingdom during the Spring and Autumn period. From Zhao Xuanzi to Zhao Wuzi, the Zhao family suffered repeated hardships, but were saved by righteous people, so they were preserved. The legend says that Cheng Ying painted the Zhao family's suffering and the righteous deeds of the eight righteous people into pictures, so that the Zhao family could see them and know the whole story. At that time, Zhao Wu was fifteen years old, strong and powerful. After seeing the pictures, he was able to take revenge. Kunqu often sings scenes such as "Trouble in the Court," "Striking the Dog," "Saving the Orphan," and "Viewing the Paintings," which depict this story. The "Searching for the Orphan and Saving the Orphan" performed in the Erhuang opera is based on the Yuan Dynasty zaju. The Yuanqu Selection has "Zhao's Orphan," which tells the story of Cheng Ying and Gongsun Chujiu saving the orphan. The Erhuang opera starts from the two men's plan, without Han Jue's suicide in front and revenge in the back, so it is not a complete opera. If the whole play is not performed, it cannot be named "The Eight Righteousnesses" in general, but only "Searching for the Orphan and Saving the Orphan."

Now, the Pihuang opera only performs "Searching for the Orphan and Saving the Orphan" because the plot of saving the orphan is the best, extremely emotional, and the used wisdom is beyond human emotion. Cheng's wife can't bear to give up her swaddled child, and Chujiu implies that Cheng Ying must do it reluctantly. Compared to "Changing Children at the Execution Ground," Xu Ce kneels down, and Xu's family gives up her own child to be loyal. The tactics are like links, emerging endlessly. Cheng Ying exposes Chujiu first, one thing; and whips him personally, two things; the orphan is searched out by Tu Anjia in person (according to historical records, after Tu Anjia killed Zhao Shuo, Zhao Kuo, etc., he repeatedly searched Zhao Shuo's wife in the palace. Shuo's wife, the daughter of Duke Jin, gave birth to an orphan, and Shuo's wife prayed to heaven, ordering the child not to cry, and if there was a sound, the Zhao family would be cut off. Tu searched for a long time, and the child was silent, so he was spared. Tu continued to search urgently, and Han Jue was ordered by Tu to guard the palace gate. Cheng Ying carried the orphan out in a medicine box and was searched out by Han. Cheng cried and begged very sadly, and Han let him go and committed suicide. Now Tu's search is the third search. If the whole play is arranged, three searches for Zhao's orphan will be more interesting), making him not suspicious, three things; Chujiu dies with the fake orphan, making Tu relieved, four things; Cheng Ying and the real orphan return to Tu's mansion for upbringing, five things; the five plans are all beyond human emotion, so even if the Tu thief is ruthless, he doesn't realize he's in the drum.

In the play, Cheng Ying begs his wife to give up her child, even kneeling down and holding a knife to her throat, which is interesting, but this is the organization of the drama. According to the historical records, "Gongsun Chujiu falsely carried another infant and hid in the mountains." The fake orphan who died with Chujiu was the child of an unknown family, not Cheng Ying's own child. The play says that it is Cheng's child, which adds a lot of drama and makes it more intimate and outstanding. This is the best organization method, and it can be said that it is Cheng's own child.

The Erhuang opera also has a complete version of this play, with scenes of viewing paintings and revenge fifteen years after searching for the orphan. Tan school old student amateur actor Wang Yutian once recorded the Erhuang Yuanban lyrics of Cheng Ying in "The Eight Righteousnesses" on a Baidai Diamond phonograph record, "Hiding the orphan in the empty mountain, it has been fifteen years now, in my heart I only hate the traitor, who harmed the Zhao family like that, alas, my brother Gongsun gave his life, alas, I am half a hundred years old and have no son, if God opens his eyes three points, revenge will be avenged, and injustice will be redressed," which is the singing before revenge. (Wang Yutian's voice is sad and suitable for singing Erhuang tunes, most like the old Tan, and his skills are also good. He once went to sea to perform in operas and died in Tianjin at the age of only forty.)

### Miscellaneous Writings on the Art Scene

— Hua

The Dahua Grand Theater is scheduled to open on the evening of the second day, presenting Miguel Lona and Judy Garland's "Meet Me in St. Louis." This afternoon at 7:30, the theater will host all sectors and preview the new film.

As everyone knows, the four first-run Western film theaters in Shanghai are now completely under the jurisdiction of the Asia Cinema, so during the holidays, they no longer compete with each other as they did in the past, selecting and screening giant films that compete with each other. Now, the Dahua Grand Theater has risen up and won the premiere rights of MGM, which produces the most films every year, so the programming of the Daguangming and Nanjing theaters will have to be considered. (The Cathay is mostly attended by Western audiences, and the Da Shanghai has now implicitly lowered its level by half, so there is no problem.)

At the end of 1939, after "The Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," another major event occurred in the drama world. That was the reorganization of the "Improved Civilization Drama." Veteran dramatist Wei Ruhui, Yu Ling and Zhou Yibai, etc., joined the Green Treasure Theater as screenwriters at the introduction of Gu Menghu. Since Tan Zhiyuan, Gu Menghu, Bai Hong, etc. first proposed the slogan of "Improved Civilization Drama," although they also encountered many setbacks, under the hard work of Gu Menghu, the Green Treasure Theater, which had always been regarded by the drama world as a civilization drama, actually established a sound foundation of a large audience. Recently, many dramatists have realized that striving for civilization drama is not a fall, especially to educate the ladies and grandmothers, they should break into the corrupt circle of life, "If I don't go to hell, who will?" Veteran dramatists such as Yu Ling and Zhou Yibai personally took the stage, which could also serve as a wake-up call for general patients with "shallow thinking."
