It is reported that the Japanese army fiercely attacked Wucheng for a week, but ultimately failed to take it. Early Friday morning, the Japanese army released poison gas. The defenders of Wucheng, about a regiment of men, continued to fight bravely in the poison gas. By 4:00 PM, the Chinese army's defenses were breached, and the Japanese army stormed into the city.

(Nanchang) The Chinese defending forces east of the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway launched a large-scale counter-offensive against the Japanese troops near Anyi yesterday afternoon, gaining overwhelming momentum. Important strongholds such as Hushan and Fenghuang Mountain, five miles northwest of Anyi County, were successively recovered. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to continue advancing towards the county seat. (26th Telegram)

(Nanchang) The Japanese troops on the left flank of the Nanchang-Xunyang line, in Anyi and Jing'an, are advancing south along the highway and are currently engaged in fierce fighting in the Wannian Palace and Wushanpu area. (26th Telegram)

(Chongqing) According to news received here, the Chinese army is now engaged in a desperate battle to stop the Japanese army from advancing on Nanchang, and admits that the Japanese troops advancing along the Nanchang-Xunyang highway have reached Wangjiapu. The area has many small hills and is now the last line of defense for the Chinese army north of Nanchang. The Chinese side considers this location to be the throat of Nanchang. Although the Japanese army's offensive is fierce, the Chinese high command has ordered the Chinese army to defend Wangjiapu at all costs to protect Nanchang. As of noon yesterday, Wangjiapu was still in the hands of the Chinese army. It is reported that the Japanese army has advanced to Feng'an Station on the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway, where battles are currently underway. The Japanese troops encircling the left flank of the Chinese army have reached Anyi and Fengxin and are still advancing south along the main highway connecting Nanchang and Changsha, heading towards Gao'an. Gao'an was heavily bombed by 48 Japanese aircraft yesterday. Another team of Japanese aircraft bombed Zhangshu and Qingjiang. The former is on the highway from Nanchang to Ji'an, and the latter is on the railway from Nanchang to Hunan. The Japanese aircraft are clearly trying to cut off traffic between various places and Nanchang. It is reported that Wucheng on the west bank of Duyang Lake fell on the 24th of this month. The Xinhua Daily today published an article commenting on the Battle of Nanchang, stating that the Japanese army's invasion of Nanchang aims to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and block traffic between the provinces of Jiangxi and Zhejiang and the Chinese interior. At the same time, after the Japanese army occupies Nanchang, it can carry out a large-scale suppression of the Chinese guerrillas active in the Nanjing, Wuhu, and Shanghai areas, as they will no longer be able to communicate with the rear. After the Japanese army occupies Nanchang, it can also threaten Changsha, as occupying Changsha is part of the Japanese strategy to open the Yuehan Railway. The newspaper predicts that the Chinese army in the Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhu areas will launch a large-scale offensive in the coming days to put pressure on the Japanese army's rear and will organize the people of Jiangxi Province to carry out guerrilla warfare. (26th Reuters Telegram)

(Chongqing) According to reports from the Chinese side, the Japanese authorities are currently using three divisions to launch a fierce attack on Nanchang. These three divisions are the 6th, 101st, and 106th divisions. (26th Associated Press Telegram)

Xiushui: The 6th Division of the Japanese army, which invaded Wuning from Xijingkou (i.e., Jinkou), has suffered heavy casualties in recent days due to the brave resistance of the Chinese army in the Guancaishan area northeast of Wuning. The Japanese army's attempt to invade Wuning seems to have realized the difficulty and temporarily retreated. The majority are now invading Dongkou from Dengxi to the south, and another part is still invading Luoping from Zhelin, appearing to be coordinating with Jing'an. Fierce fighting broke out in Dongkou and Luoping on the 26th. (26th Telegram)

(Nanchang) The Japanese troops invading Wuning from Jin Kou because the mountain roads are rugged, in a dilemma of advance and retreat, and are currently entrenched in the Tong Kou Luo Ping area three or four from the south bank of the Xiu River, in fierce battles with the Chinese army.

### The Japanese Army's Use of Poison Gas to Force a Crossing of the Xiu River

(Nanchang) The Chinese army on the Xiu River front occupied several strongholds on the north bank southeast of Yongxiu and east of Qiujin, posing a threat to the Japanese army. At about 10:00 PM on the 17th, the Japanese army suddenly gathered four to five hundred men and launched four attacks on the Chinese-held north bank of Xia Shan under Tu Jiabu, all of which were bravely repelled by the Chinese defenders. The Japanese army then released a large amount of poison gas from near Guanyinge and Chencun on the north bank to cover their crossing of the river. Although some of the Chinese defenders were poisoned, they still held the river bank. From 12:00 AM on the night of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, the Japanese army made three attempts to cross the river by force, but were all repelled. The Japanese army then used artillery fire and poison gas to cover the construction of pontoon bridges near the railway line, and more than a thousand men crossed the river one after another and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese side. By the 19th, the Japanese army had invaded Dawangmiao, Weicun, and Dalu * six or seven miles north of Tu Jiabu. On the night of the 19th, the Chinese army launched a counter-offensive against Dalu *, with the area being lost and regained five or six times. The area has become scorched earth, but it is still being held by the Chinese army. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered two to three hundred casualties, and dozens of Japanese soldiers were captured alive. On the Chencun side northwest of Tu Jiabu, the battle between the Japanese and Chinese armies on the night of the 19th was even fiercer than before. Chencun is still being firmly defended by the Chinese army. Unable to succeed, the Japanese army turned from Tu Jiabu to launch a forced crossing between Yongxiu and Qiujin. On the night of the 20th, the Japanese army divided into four routes to launch a forced crossing to the south bank, one route crossing the river near Gouziling in Yongxiu, another route crossing the river in Liuzhuang, another route crossing the river in Liaojia, and another route crossing the river in Huaguowei. When crossing the river, the Japanese army used intense artillery fire and released a large amount of poison gas to cover their movements, causing more than a thousand Japanese troops to cross to the south bank of the Xiu River. The Japanese troops who forced the crossing in Liuzhuang and Liaojia continued to invade west to the Shizi Mountain and Taiziling area. Forced to do so, the Chinese army transferred the defenders of the Zhanggongdu south of the salient. By the morning of the 21st, another two hundred or more Japanese troops crossed the river from Outang City on the north bank, and then hundreds more crossed the river. The Chinese army resisted step by step in Fengqishan, Yanjielong, Zhu Zhuang, and other areas, annihilating many Japanese troops. By the afternoon of the 21st, the Japanese army continued to add a regiment of troops and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Tan Xi direction. On the morning of the 22nd, the Chinese and Japanese armies engaged in fierce fighting in the Dazhun Bridge area north of Tan Xi for half a day. By the afternoon of the 22nd, the Japanese army continued to reinforce and released a large amount of poison gas to launch a fierce attack on the Chinese army. The defenders of the Chinese position sacrificed heroically and transferred to the high ground south of Tan Xi to hold their positions. (25th Telegram)

(Hong Kong) Chongqing Telegram: There were still major battles in northern Jiangxi on the 26th. Due to heavy casualties, the Japanese army continued to transfer troops from Jiujiang to reinforce various routes. The Japanese troops near Fengxin and Anyi attempted to attack Gao'an, but were intercepted by the Chinese army and failed to advance. The Chinese and Japanese armies are still engaged in fierce fighting north of Lehua Street and Qiandian near Wanjiafu. Currently, the area north of Nanchang and Gao'an to Tai Xin and Anyi is under Chinese control. The Chinese counter-offensive troops are advancing rapidly, and some units have reached the De'an Ruichang area, where they are engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. (26th Special Dispatch)

(Nanchang) The Chinese army obtained a large number of Japanese military documents at the front line of the Xiu River. The following is an excerpt from the translated orders of the Japanese army to slaughter civilians: "(1) Local residents are not allowed to approach the Japanese military's stationed area. Violators, regardless of gender, age, or child, will be executed without exception. (2) Food and utensils will be requisitioned locally. (3) Villages near Tan Xi must be completely burned. (4) Residents with suspicious behavior must be thoroughly slaughtered." The Japanese army's brutal behavior towards Chinese civilians is infuriating to both gods and men. (26th Telegram)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops invading from the Xiu River are still being blocked by the Chinese army on the Anyi-Fengxin line. Some units of the Chinese army launched a counter-offensive from Jing'an yesterday morning. After eight hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was forced to retreat towards Wanjiafu. The Japanese troops in Fengxin, whose rear lines were cut off, also fled to the northeast. In the Wuning area, both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting in the mountainous area from the northern bank of the Xiu River to Zhanggonglin Wangnaoshan. The intensity of the fighting exceeds that of the battles of Shanghai Guangjitian and Jiaozhen. Because this line is the main position for the Chinese army to defend Wuning, the Chinese army is sparing no sacrifice to defend this line. Since the 23rd of this month, the Japanese army has repeatedly charged under the cover of intense artillery fire and large formations of aircraft, but they have all been bravely repelled by the Chinese army. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)

(Hankou) According to sources here, the Japanese troops on the Nanchang-Xunyang Road front are still trapped between Yongxiu and Tu Jiabu. Despite their fierce offensive in recent days, they have made no progress. It is reported that the Japanese authorities in Jiujiang have expressed anxiety and disappointment. According to a statement by the Japanese military spokesperson in Wuhan last night, a portion of the Japanese army had infiltrated Leizi Gang, fifteen kilometers south of Yongxiu, and Cixi, twenty kilometers south of Yongxiu, in an attempt to disrupt the Chinese army's rear defense positions. However, according to neutral sources here, these small teams of Japanese troops that had scattered were all annihilated by the Chinese army. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese military personnel, the Japanese army's ambition to cut off the transportation lines between Nanchang and Xiushui Wuning has been individually defeated by the Chinese army. On the 24th of this month, the Chinese army, led by mechanized units, launched a fierce counter-offensive against the Japanese troops that had infiltrated between Anyi and Fengxin. After a bloody battle day and night, the Japanese army was forced to retreat to the Long'an Bridge Wanjiafu Qian. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 5,000 casualties. The Chinese army is now continuing to encircle and annihilate the Japanese troops in Anyi and Wuning. Both sides are engaged in bayonet fighting in the mountainous area northwest of Chen Zhuang. Since yesterday morning, the Japanese army has repeatedly launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army's positions on the Wanshoushan Songshan line under the cover of intense artillery fire and large formations of aircraft, but has not yet succeeded. In general, although the situation in Wuning and Nanchang is very tense, it will still be quite difficult for the Japanese army to achieve its goal of occupying the above two places, and the losses it suffers will far exceed those of the Battle of Taierzhuang. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)

(Hankou) According to a statement by a spokesperson at the Japanese military press conference here, the Chinese army in the Wuning area is resisting very strongly. Although it has been bombed by Japanese heavy artillery and aircraft, it has not retreated slightly. Therefore, the Japanese army is still unable to approach Wuning. Currently, Wanshoushan, Shengzishan, and Songshan, two kilometers northwest of Wuning, are still under siege by the Japanese army. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)

Editorial

### Germany, Japan, and Qingdao

Yesterday, it was suddenly reported that Germany and Japan were touching on the issue of Jiaozhou Bay Island. In this time of ever-changing international developments, such rumors cannot be dismissed merely because they do not conform to common sense and reason. Therefore, we would like to express our views.

The source of the news is London and Berlin. The reporters are Reuters of the United Kingdom, Havas of France, and Tongxun Agency of Germany. The nature of the reports is either that Japan took the initiative in this gift, or that Germany took the initiative in making this request. It is said that the Japanese intend to befriend Germany in advocating that all countries return their colonies to Germany. It is also said that the Japanese intend that Germany will hand over Jiaozhou Bay to Japan after the United Kingdom and France return Germany's former possessions. It is said that what the Germans are concerned about is that this move is not in line with the friendship between China and Germany. Others argue that the military significance of this matter is more important than the economic significance.

Qingdao has always belonged to Chinese territory throughout China's five thousand years of history and is purely a corner of the land where the Chinese people live. However, it is true that it has had a short period of history with both Germany and Japan. In 1897, Germany occupied Qingdao on the pretext of the murder of two German missionaries in China. In 1898, the Qing government signed a treaty with Germany to cede it; this was the beginning of Germany's occupation of Jiaozhou Bay, its management of Qingdao, and its eyeing of Shandong. Ten years later, in 1914, Japan declared war on Germany and captured it after a month-long siege; as a result, Germany's efforts in Qingdao not only went to waste, but its assets were also occupied by Japan, and its only base in the Far East was wiped out. In 1921, China and Germany resumed diplomatic relations, and Germany declared that it would abandon this right. In 1922, China recovered it. At the end of 1937, that is, four months after August 13th, China destroyed Qingdao and retreated. For more than a year until this year, it has been under the control of the Japanese army. The past is like this, and the historical facts are as solid as iron, so there is no doubt that its fundamental sovereignty belongs to China. Moreover, military occupation is only a temporary aberration and is not enough to shake sovereignty, which is a general principle of international law. Therefore, yesterday's foreign telegrams either said that Japan would return Qingdao to Germany, or that Japan would gift Qingdao to Germany. The words "return" and "gift" are all linguistic errors. If such measures are taken, then their essence is theft and private transfer of other people's property. It is a legal error and an invalid act that is not enough to confront a third country.

The German government recognizes this statement as slanderous, intended to stir up anti-German sentiment. Germany has not only not discussed this matter with Japan, but has not even considered it. This expression is extremely wise, and the good impression it gives to the world far exceeds the scope of the Jiaozhou Bay Island issue. Because Germany's actions on the European continent seem to be that Germany is a country that recklessly disregards everything, only seeks profit, and penetrates everywhere, the objective reaction is so serious. But for this military and economic base that once had its origins, it can be calm and tranquil, taking into account anti-German sentiment, and declaring it so solemnly. The two comparisons are of profound significance. Furthermore, what can be conclusively proven is that, despite some unfriendly actions towards China by Germany in recent years, which have gradually diminished the friendship between the two countries, the two countries are still long-standing and friendly nations with deep friendship. China, of course, does not want to immediately become hostile to Germany because of Germany's protection of Japan, and Germany will not oppress or infringe upon China because it has protected Japan to some extent. From this analysis, as long as Germany does not increase its share of Japan any further and make it difficult for China, the Sino-German relationship in the victory of the Chinese resistance will inevitably return to harmony. This is to see the subtle and know the obvious, and the clue is revealed in Germany's denial of the rumor this time.

However, the Qingdao issue that was reported yesterday cannot be regarded as pure fiction simply because Germany denies it. Because although Germany "has not discussed this matter and has not even considered it," this issue still has the possibility of being initiated separately. If the foreign remarks believe that "the military significance of this is more important than the economic significance," this is indeed a talk that misses the point. Because in terms of "emphasizing military strategy," Germany's revival and expansion has never been used to it so far. Is there any reason to have a far-reaching military strategy in the small island of Qingdao? Is there any reason to use troops as a doorman for Japan? Is there any reason to help Japan fight China? Is there any reason to extend national defense by dividing forces? Is there any reason to take a detour through the Far East by using Japan against Russia? Germany knows this, and Japan also knows it. Therefore, it has nothing to do with military strategy, so why emphasize military strategy? It is important to know that if the rumor of this issue is indeed based on something, then its significance is 100% in diplomacy. Only in diplomacy, so Germany's denial can be initiated by Japan's one-sided infatuation.

Originally, Japan's international policy after launching military aggression was extremely distressed due to external isolation and blindly struggling due to internal disagreements. Therefore, it uses small cleverness and small skills to explore for a way out everywhere, but it turns out that it encounters dead ends everywhere. For example, the so-called new order, the new regime, the declaration of allowing friendly countries to cooperate with Japan in developing China, and even this Qingdao issue are all small cleverness and small skills. And it cannot be resolved quickly, limited by its strength, and the new order of monopoly cannot be established; the puppet is only parasitic and not enough to call for, so the new regime, which is its tool, loses its original intention; the protests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France continue, so the false cooperation cannot cover up its face, and Germany denies the rumors of the Qingdao issue, so the conspiracy is ineffective; these are all signs of dead ends. How does the Qingdao issue contain a conspiracy? To please Germany with other people's generosity and seek German assistance, such as purchasing military supplies on credit, is one. To respond to the protest about closing the door and swallowing China alone, and to show that it does not close the door and does not swallow it alone, is two. To show people the magnanimity of sharing spoils to reduce the friction caused by aggressive behavior internationally, is three. To induce aggressive partners, is four. To seek apportionment of blame for aggression, is five. To gradually expand the vortex of war, to seek survival in desperation, and to ridicule the retreat as a single defeat, is six. Only these six reasons can be the reasons for its one-sided initiation. If Germany has declared that it has never discussed this, we naturally trust this statement. This is probably because Japan is afraid that this move will not be enough to lure Germany, but it is unwilling to bury this small cleverness and small skill, so it first reveals it to the overseas press to test Germany's intentions and reserve room for advance and retreat. This kind of probing method is common in the international community.

Small cleverness and small skills in diplomacy initially fail to deceive international politicians, and only expose their mental labor and become increasingly clumsy. However, sometimes it also has its wonderful uses. Because intrigues and deceits sometimes know that it is a temporary deception, but they use its deception and pretend to be deaf and blind; or accept its deception and let the error continue. For example, Japan has already arranged the monopoly of foreign exchange and trade in North China, and is not worried about the entry of other countries, so it announced the opening of the outer port of Qingdao. So it deliberately implies that other places will be gradually opened. This kind of stealing the sky and changing the sun and returning the pearl for the casket's small skills can be seen through by even a three-foot-tall child. But who knows that there are no authorities of other countries who take it as an excuse to deceive their members of parliament and their industrial and commercial sectors to show their diplomatic success with Japan and to shirk their obligations to aid China? Therefore, all international phenomena, no matter how unreasonable or even contrary to common sense, if there is a one in ten, one in a hundred, one in a thousand, or one in ten thousand possibility, we cannot ignore them.

Advisor to Chairman Chiang Discusses

### China's War Will Extend at Least Three More Years; Japan Has Made a Major Mistake, Resulting in China's Victory; Failure and Chaos Belong to Japan

(London) American missionary Mr. Shepherd, who has served as an advisor to Chairman Chiang and his wife for the past five years, specializing in providing the Chairman with consultation on matters of people's welfare and construction, recently told a Reuters reporter that the war in China will last at least another three years, and China will ultimately win. There are two reasons for the recent lull in the fighting: first, the Japanese suffered heavy losses in terms of soldiers and equipment during the attack on Hankou; second, the Japanese harbored a hope that Chinese leaders would sue for peace after occupying Hankou. In reality, none of the important Chinese leaders lean towards the Japanese side. Since the beginning of the war, Japan has consistently made a major mistake, namely, failing to account for the new spirit of China. China is subjected to air raids everywhere, averaging five air raids per day, but residents have been given sufficient warning to evacuate the cities and take refuge elsewhere. These air raids have not only failed to discourage the Chinese, but have also increased their hatred of the enemy. Today, China's greatest need is medicine, and this need will be particularly urgent in the next three years. Chinese women are greatly assisting the nation, and Madame Chiang is to China today what Queen Victoria was to England in the past. (26th Day Reuters Dispatch)

(New York) According to yesterday's New York Times editorial, the Sino-Japanese War has evolved to the point where it is not only a victory of no benefit to Japan but also a complete failure and chaos. "Although the Japanese have been victorious militarily so far, it is really unknown what these victories are ultimately good for. On the contrary, although China has no military victories to speak of so far, its national spirit has been greatly developed and strengthened in the midst of failure, and at the same time, the stagnation and corruption in the political sphere have been greatly cleared away as a result. Although the Japanese have caused foreign trade to stagnate, with most trade being controlled by the Japanese, many of the original plans in Tokyo have been unable to be implemented. In short, this war is not only of no glory or benefit to the Japanese, but will also increasingly plunge them into poverty." (26th Day Associated Press Dispatch)

### The Chinese Government Strives to Maintain Credit; Current Measures Are Temporary; The Government Does Not Want This to Continue in the Long Term

(Chongqing) Finance Minister Kong officially issued a statement today, saying that the government has begun to contact the parties involved regarding debts secured by customs tax. Before the contact is completed, public bonds secured by tax should be handled in the same way as public bonds secured by customs duties, which have been implemented since January 15. (Note: On January 15 of this year, the Ministry of Finance announced that the Chinese government would not be able to fully repay maturing debts secured by customs duties from January 15 due to the arbitrary detention of customs duties by the Japanese army. However, for long-term loans, the government has designated special funds in the Central Bank for the repayment of principal and interest, and these special funds have already been allocated.) However, British and French loans will still be paid on time for the portion due on April 15, as the funds have already been allocated by the finance department to the paying agent. As for the Crisp Loan, the government has designated funds from the tax revenue to be used to pay the interest due to bondholders on March 30. The Chinese government is deeply concerned about maintaining its credit and safeguarding the interests of bondholders, despite encountering unprecedented difficulties due to the Japanese invasion. The current measures taken for various public bonds secured by tariffs are actually measures that had to be adopted due to environmental factors. The government absolutely does not want this to continue in the long term and will find a practical and appropriate method that is in line with the current long-term war of resistance and the principle of stabilizing China's financial and economic situation, in order to maintain China's credit.

### Central Epidemic Prevention Year Intensifies Work

(Kunming) The Central Epidemic Prevention Bureau moved from Changsha to Yunnan Province last July. The various manufacturing plants under its jurisdiction have been merged with Lanzhou in Suiyuan and Mengjiang. Personnel from Guangzhou are now working in Kunming. The bureau's main tasks are manufacturing vaccines, sera, and smallpox vaccines. The bureau is now concentrating all its talent to manufacture cholera, typhoid, and other vaccines for the army to meet the needs of the front lines. (25th Day Dispatch)

### British Residents in Guangzhou Express Gratitude to the Navy

(Guangzhou) Members of the British Association in Guangzhou expressed their gratitude to the British Navy for its efforts to rescue Shameen during the critical period last October, preventing it from being looted. Therefore, a silver shield has been presented by Mr. Smith, the manager of Jardine Matheson & Co. here, who is also the chairman of the Association, to the commander of the West River Fleet on the British gunboat Teal, expressing their gratitude. It is reported that during the great fire in Guangzhou at the end of last October, British sailors and residents of Shameen guarded the area day and night, preventing the flames from spreading to the buildings of Shameen.

### Yunnan Province's Railway Line Abounds in Coal Production

Kunming: In order to understand the geology and mineral resources along the entire line of the Kunming Railway, the Kunming Railway Bureau specially dispatched geologist Lin Wenying to conduct an investigation. It is reported that the investigation revealed 24 occurrences of coal seams along the line, all of good quality, which are rare in the country. It is reported that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has learned of this and intends to send personnel to conduct a detailed survey for the purpose of exploitation. (26th Day Dispatch)

### Anqing Resumes Transshipment Mail; Japanese-Called Positions Largely Determined

Since the Shanghai Postal Administration resumed postal service between Shanghai and Anqing, communication with various inland bureaus in Anqing has also been restored. The following is a record:

Shanghai-Anhui Postal Service

The Anqing Post Office, after withdrawing to Shanghai, has resumed operations at the beginning of the month after nearly a year. Xu Lansheng, the Director of the Anqing Postal Administration, has entered the original site of the previous Postal Administration to work. In addition to mail from Shanghai to Anqing, mail from various inland bureaus can also be transshipped through Anqing. However, the transportation of mail is handed over to Japanese ships for loading.

Japanese-Called Positions

The Shanghai Postal Administration has recently employed four Japanese postal workers. One of them is to be sent to the Anqing Bureau, and the others will be sent to Nanjing, Hankou, Guangdong, and other places. However, whether further changes will be necessary in the future is not convenient to speculate before the Bureau has issued a clear order.

Examination Questions

There has been considerable criticism regarding the examination of the four Japanese employees. The Postal Bureau has always required strict examinations for the employment of employees. The examination for senior postal workers must be entrusted by the Ministry of Communications and designated by the Postal Bureau. At the same time, the practice of holding examinations for foreign postal workers in London in the past decade has long been abolished, so no one has been added.

A Little Clarification

This reason has led to criticism. However, those who understand the Bureau's environment allow it to be appropriate. To say that the four Japanese employees took the exam in Tokyo is disrespectful to the highest postal authorities, because under the current circumstances, Chinese postal workers are definitely not allowed to take exams in belligerent countries.

### Japanese Troops Attacking Muyang Suffer Losses; Chinese Army Captures Zhaoguan Dam, Killing Over One Hundred Japanese Soldiers

Shuyang Communication: At dawn on the 23rd, the Japanese troops under Yanagida and Rokuno, along with 20 tanks, under the cover of five aircraft, attacked Shuyang and Donghai, attempting to cut off the Zhenghai Highway. Under the leadership of Shuyang County Chief Zhu Aizhou, the Chinese army bravely resisted, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. As a result, the Japanese troops in southern Shandong attacked from Huandun, Heilin, and Tuohuang in three routes in order to attack Shuhai from both sides. At the same time, fierce battles also occurred in Hanjiaji, Shijiaji, Yanghe, Yanghua, Daxing, and other places. Yangzhou Communication: Ogawa, the commander of the Japanese troops in Yangzhou, and Guiban, the commander of the Japanese troops in Xiannvmiao, transferred thousands of Japanese and puppet troops to Zhaoguan Dam from Zhenjiang and other places in the past week. The Chinese Command transferred the Zhang Regiment of the provincial security forces to the west to assist the Yu Regiment of the Wang Brigade of the Chinese Army to defend it. On the morning of the 12th, seven or eight hundred Japanese and puppet troops, carrying four mortars and more than 20 light and heavy machine guns, launched a surprise attack on Zhaoguan Dam and Zhibei Ferry by land and water. The Yu and Zhang Regiments fought back separately. The Japanese advanced step by step with the most fierce artillery fire. The Chinese army fought bravely, one falling as another charged forward. After five or six hours, both sides suffered casualties. The Chinese side moved its stronghold backward for strategic reasons. The next morning, reinforcements arrived and launched a large-scale counterattack. The Japanese, with their extended battle line and limited troops, resisted stubbornly for several hours. Finally, due to the Chinese army's hundredfold courage, they were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed toward Shaobo. Zhaoguan Dam was recaptured by the Chinese army. In this battle, more than 150 Japanese soldiers were killed, six Japanese motorboats and sixteen civilian boats were destroyed, and more than 20 horses scattered.

### Mussolini's Speech: Willing to Maintain Long-Term Peace; Changes in Central Europe Are Inevitable; Germany and Italy are Happy to Deal with the Anti-Dictatorial Front

(Rome) Today marks the 20th anniversary of the Fascist Party. Prime Minister Mussolini hosted a celebration ceremony at the stadium and delivered a speech to 60,000 veteran party members. Diplomats from various countries were invited to attend. The Prime Minister said, "Today's grand event is held at a time when the situation in Europe is tense. The principles we adhere to are very clear. In our view, professional pacifists are truly despicable. Permanent peace is enough to brew disaster, but we still believe that it is necessary to maintain a long period of peace in order to preserve European civilization and promote it. However, one thing must be stated, that is, unless the sacred rights that we should enjoy are recognized, we will not be able to achieve anything. Any attempt aimed at weakening, undermining, or destroying the Rome-Berlin axis will inevitably fail. (The audience applauded and shouted, "Long live Hitler.") It should be known that this axis is not only the foundation of friendship between Germany and Italy but also the crystallization of two revolutions. We can clearly state that the changes that have occurred in Central Europe recently are inevitable. There is a country that possesses a strong military force and many weapons and factories, but when faced with foreign invasion, it does not know how to resist. I dare to say that the time for this country to change its destiny has already matured and can only be allowed to take its course. On the other hand, if the world forms a group to oppose the dictatorial countries, the dictatorial countries will not only be happy to deal with them but will also counterattack in all aspects."

### Only Three Demands Made to France

Last year, when I gave a speech in the port of Genoa, I said that there was an obstacle between France and Italy (referring to Spain). Today, this obstacle is about to disappear. The national army of Spain will enter the city of Madrid within a few days, or even a few hours. Once seen as the tomb of Fascism, it will soon become the tomb of Bolshevism. Everything we do does not require the world to judge it, we just want to inform the world of our views. Our government sent a note to France on December 17 last year and frankly explained the outstanding issues, which involved Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal, all of which are colonial issues. The French government has agreed to discuss these issues. It has full freedom, and we cannot intervene. Up to now, it is true that the French government has always firmly opposed it. But one thing should be noted, that is, if the gap between France and Italy continues to widen, eventually becoming difficult or even impossible to bridge, the French government should not blame others. France and Italy are both Latin nations and share blood ties, but we no longer want to hear this. Between countries, everything should be based on military strength, and the policies pursued should be shifted according to the growth and decline of military strength.

### The Mediterranean and Italy's Survival are Crucially Related

The Mediterranean, whether geographically, historically, politically, or militarily, is a space that is crucial to Italy's survival. When we say the Mediterranean, we should include the Adriatic Sea. Although we do not need to exclude the interests that the Slavic peoples have in the Adriatic Sea, the interests that Italy has should be in a superior position. This is something that the world cannot but know.

Finally, there is one more point, which is also the most important, and that is that we must expand our military. Our slogan is to use all methods and spare no expense to have more cannons, more warships, and more airplanes, even if it means completely abandoning the enjoyment of civilized life. All people must be strong in order to be loved by friends and feared by enemies. "The weak have no one to turn to," has always been the case, and it is still the same today. Comrades, we have worked together in the past and engaged in fierce battles, and we should do so in the future. If the interests of Italy and the interests of Fascism are harmed, we should be prepared to shed blood and defend them.

At this point, the Prime Minister asked the audience, "Do you want honor, rewards, and a comfortable life? Is there anything you cannot get?" The audience shouted, "We want it!" The Prime Minister then said, "Our creed has three parts: (1) faith, (2) obedience, (3) struggle. The key to all victory lies in this." Since the Party took power, the achievements that have been made are innumerable, but they have not all been completed. We are only beginning to work on social issues. Various democratic countries often say that Fascist Italy is bankrupt, has lost its strength due to the war against Abyssinia, and must borrow from the UK to survive. These slanders have now been proven to be false. In short, the achievements we have made in the past are very important in nature, but the work that should be carried out in the future is even more important. I am confident that we will be able to complete it, because my ambitions are unyielding and your spirits are also very active." (26th Day Havas Dispatch)

### French Observation: Situation Unchanged

(Paris) Prime Minister Mussolini's speech this morning has been commented on by political figures here. They say that he did not express anything hopeless, and the difficulties encountered in the relationship between France and Italy have not been exacerbated as a result. The fact that he referred to his speech in Genoa last year shows that the various outstanding issues between France and Italy cannot be resolved before the end of the Spanish Civil War. Regarding this, France's original position has not changed. In other words, the management rights of the Suez Canal and matters related to the French Djibouti port in East Africa can be submitted for discussion, but as far as the status of Italian residents in French Tunisia is concerned, France has no reason to accept other methods other than those in accordance with the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement. In addition, Prime Minister Mussolini pointed out that the problems that Italy should solve in the Mediterranean are not limited to the outstanding issues between France and Italy, and said that Italy should be in a superior position in the Adriatic Sea. Although these words are euphemistic, they are ultimately a warning to Germany not to take any action on the Port of Trieste (which was ceded to Italy by the former Austria after the European War and is now a free port).

### Britain Will Completely Innovate its Fleet Within Two Years; A Total of Twenty-Four Battleships

(London) After studying the existing naval shipbuilding plan and interviewing informed sources, a Reuters naval reporter learned that Britain will have a completely new navy within two years, including nine battleships, which are the fastest battleships ever built by Britain. Among them, five are named HMS King George V, HMS Prince of Wales, HMS Duke of York, HMS Admiral Jellicoe, and HMS Admiral Beatty, each 35,000 tons, equipped with 14-inch caliber guns. Two are named HMS Lion and HMS Temeraire, each 40,000 tons, equipped with 16-inch caliber guns. The names of the remaining two are undecided, and their tonnage and gun caliber are also unknown, but it is assumed that they will be the same as the Lion. HMS King George V will be completed by the end of next year. HMS Prince of Wales will be launched on May 3 in Whitsun Bay and will also be ready for service by the end of next year. By early spring 1941, HMS Duke of York, HMS Jellicoe, and HMS Beatty (all of which began construction in the summer of 1937) will also be completed. Each of the above five larger ships can carry four aircraft and is equipped with equipment to defend against air attacks. In addition to these nine new battleships (each costing approximately 8 million pounds), the British Navy also has twelve active battleships and three battlecruisers, so Britain has a total of twenty-four battleships. Of the active battleships, five battleships and three battlecruisers belong to the Home Fleet, and a total of seven belong to the Mediterranean Fleet. Some of the active battleships have already undergone modernization and refurbishment, so they are equal to the latest type of new ships with strong combat power. (26th Day Reuters Dispatch)

### Hitler's Reassertion: Willing to Support Italy

(Berlin) Hitler, in a letter to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Fascist Party, stated: "The Italian nation has striven to resist the conspiracies of those filled with malice and a lack of understanding. The German nation, sharing the same ideals as your country, is willing to be its backing." Any attempt to obstruct the legitimate development of the just aspirations of our two countries will be jointly resisted by the German nation, (Havas, 25th).

(Rome) An official communiqué was recently released, stating that German leader Hitler sent a telegram to Prime Minister Mussolini, delivered by Prince Regent Hess, saying that a year ago, after Germany annexed Austria, leader Hitler sent a letter to the Prime Minister through Prince Hess, explaining the reasons for the annexation and guaranteeing the inviolability of Italy's northern border, the Brenner Pass (Havas, 25th).

(Rome) A certain French newspaper reported that Italy's northern border, the Brenner Pass, was under threat from Germany. Prime Minister's spokesperson Gayda recently wrote in the Italian People's Voice to correct this, stating: "Since no one is threatening the Brenner Pass, Italy has no need to fortify it. Even if threatened, Italy's existing forces are sufficient to cope with it. Instead of worrying about us, the French should shift their gaze to the Rhine, where 3.5 million true Germans reside, ruled by France, but actually belonging to the German Empire. Isn't that more worrisome?" (Havas, 26th)

(Berlin) Political figures here recently stated that, regarding the relationship between Germany and Italy, Germany's main desire is that its expansion of power towards Eastern and Southeastern Europe should not be hindered, so as to expand its "living space." Germany, having achieved success in recent events, repeatedly speaks of the interconnected relationship between Germany and Italy. Moreover, when Germany annexed the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, Italy took a reserved attitude. Grateful for this, Germany wants to promote the Rome-Berlin Axis, plainly stating that Germany still needs to rely on Italy to make Britain and France pay attention to the Mediterranean, just as it relies on Japan to make the Soviet Union devote all its energy to watching the Far East. However, Germany is no longer willing to accept greater constraints from Italy, and it has also declined suggestions to conclude a military alliance. Furthermore, after Italy's recent activities towards Yugoslavia and Poland, Germany has felt obvious displeasure. This is also why Germany is unwilling to make further overtures to Italy. In short, what Germany is concerned about is expanding its power towards Southeastern Europe, while on the one hand making colonial demands, and on the other hand promoting the interconnected relationship between Germany and Italy, thereby diverting and restraining the attention of Britain and France, so as to do as it pleases in Southeastern Europe. That is all, (Havas, 26th).

(Berlin) A speech recently delivered by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has been commented on by political figures here, saying that Prime Minister Mussolini may have had a phone call with leader Hitler beforehand, and that the speech's propositions were completely endorsed by Germany. As for the relationship between France and Italy, Prime Minister Mussolini did not burn all bridges, and Germany would be very willing to hear about future re-engagements, (Agence Havas, 26th).

### Soviet Population: Over 170 Million

(Moscow) According to the Soviet National Planning Committee, based on a nationwide survey conducted on January 17th, the total population of the Soviet Union is 170,126,000. This is a preliminary statistical figure, and the final accurate figure will be announced in mid-April, (TASS, 26th).

### Explanation of Italy's Three Demands

(London) Italian national journalist Gayda, known as the spokesperson for Prime Minister Mussolini, recently published a lengthy article in the Star Evening News here, explaining Italy's demands on France. He said, "France has neither fulfilled the 1915 London Treaty between Britain, France, and Italy, nor has it kept the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement. According to Article 13 of the 1915 amendment, Britain and France should have given Italy a certain place as an exchange condition for Italy's assistance to the Allied nations in the war. However, France has not fulfilled this condition. Former French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, in order to fulfill his promise, signed an agreement with the Italian authorities on January 7, 1935, attached with a secret letter, declaring that the French government was willing to relinquish its interests in Abyssinia. In other words, Italy should have France's tacit approval for any actions in Abyssinia. Subsequently, France imposed economic sanctions on Italy, destroying the political basis of the Franco-Italian cooperation agreement. Now, Italy has no other request, but hopes to wait for France to provide territorial compensation in the colonies based on treaty rights. Some may ask what new demands Italy will make on France. Regarding this, the Italian government has not yet made any decision. What the newspapers have reported in the past are merely speculations by the newspapers and reporters. It should be known that the Italian government has not yet made any decision on this matter. However, there are several obvious points that Italy should raise with France. Among them, there are three important items: (1) The Tunisia issue: The number of Italian residents in that place actually exceeds that of the French. It is only because hundreds of thousands of Italian residents have acquired French nationality that French official statistics do not distinguish them, so outsiders do not understand and believe that there are more French than Italians. In addition, incidents of abuse of Italian residents are also frequently seen. It should be known that the reason why Italy recognized France's exercise of protectorate in Tunisia in the past was on the condition that the French government guarantee the national rights of Italian residents. Now, there are obvious circumstances that violate this condition, and it must be stopped. (2) The Suez Canal issue: What Italy demands is that the management methods of the Suez Canal must be revised to adapt to the new era and the new needs of various countries. (3) The French Djibouti Port issue in East Africa: The hinterland of that port has common interests with the Italian Empire, and France should cooperate with Italy. However, it does not do so, allowing the last batch of Abyssinian rebels to gather in the port and protecting them, and levying huge freight fees on Italian goods passing through the port and from the port via the Addis Ababa railway line, which is very wrong. If all these issues are not resolved, there will never be a day for reconciliation between France and Italy. On the Italian side, there has long been a determination to clarify the current situation. However, the French authorities stubbornly adhere to their opinions and cannot devise a good solution. If the current situation can be quickly and safely clarified in this way, it will be extremely difficult," (Havas, 26th).

### Roman Observation: Situation Eases

(Rome) Political figures here recently stated that Prime Minister Mussolini's speech today may ease the situation in the Mediterranean. Even if this prospect is very weak, it should not be ignored. A close examination of the Prime Minister's speech reveals that the section on Franco-Italian relations is the most important, as it has clearly indicated that the Spanish issue will no longer become an obstacle to bilateral relations. The only thing that remains to be resolved is the colonial issue, but the Prime Minister only spoke of it as a "problem" and did not use the word "demand." As for the so-called colonial issue, although the Prime Minister did not specifically explain it, according to well-informed sources, Italy's minimum "desires" are no more than the following: (1) The de jure status of Italian residents in French Tunisia in North Africa should be revised. (2) France should cede the railway from Djibouti Port to Addis Ababa to Italy. (3) A portion of French Djibouti Port should be designated as a free port for Italy's use. (4) Reduce Suez Canal transit fees. (5) Allow Italy to participate in the management rights of the Suez Canal. It seems that these so-called "natural desires of Italy" are now officially targeting Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal. Diplomatic figures say that observing the speeches made successively by King Emmanuel III and Prime Minister Mussolini, it is known that Italy is now waiting for France to take the first step in order to reopen negotiations. As for the reason why the Prime Minister mentioned the Adriatic Sea in his speech, it was probably to indicate that no third country is allowed to interfere in the Adriatic coast, (Havas, 26th).

### German-Dutch Trade Agreement: Already Signed

(Berlin) Economic negotiations conducted by representatives of the German government and the Dutch government have been completed, and an economic agreement was signed today, increasing the volume of bilateral trade, (Havas, 25th).

(Berlin) The current trade agreement between Germany and the Netherlands will expire on the 31st of this month. The two sides have recently renewed the agreement, expanding the scope of the current agreement. The content has not yet been made public. It is reported that trade between Germany and the Netherlands declined significantly in 1938. German exports to the Netherlands decreased by 18%, and imports from the Netherlands also decreased by 12%. It is said that the current trade agreement lists 120 kinds of German goods and stipulates import quotas, but in reality, only ten have reached the quota over the years, (Agence Havas, 26th).

### Setback in Spanish Peace Talks: Conditions Difficult to Fulfill

Burgos: Last night, it was believed here that it would not be easy to occupy Madrid without bloodshed. Therefore, the atmosphere of peaceful resolution is not as strong as it was a few hours ago, because a certain negotiating representative of the government army said that General Miaja and Colonel Casado felt that the agreed-upon surrender conditions were difficult to implement. People on the government side stated that if the Republican army cannot fulfill the conditions of surrender, the National Army will engage in siege warfare, and it is expected that the Republican army will not be able to resist for long, (Haitong, 26th).

Lisbon: According to a radio broadcast report from Madrid last night, the government army will continue to hold peace talks with General Franco, and will never make a shameful surrender. The news circulating outside that representatives of the Madrid Defense Council have gone to Burgos for negotiations is not accurate. According to the information revealed in the report, the peace talks between Madrid and Burgos are exchanging opinions in code on the radio, (Associated Press, 26th).

Burgos: It is said that Madrid sent representatives again yesterday to consult with General Franco on the final peace conditions. It is heard that the content is about the surrender of the government army's air force. It is learned that the government army's aircraft are now being transferred, (Haitong, 26th).

(Rome) According to a telegram from Madrid yesterday afternoon, the government army's aircraft, including 30 fighter jets and 15 bombers, have been handed over to the National Army. It is heard that after this matter is completed, the National Army will enter the city of Madrid. It is estimated that the vanguard of the National Army can enter the city this morning, and its main force will continue to arrive, (Haitong, 26th).

(Rome) The Italian Daily reports that, according to news from Madrid, the Republican government authorities have now "completely succumbed" according to the conditions proposed by the National Army government. The first step is to hand over all military aircraft in the city, including 30 fighter jets and 15 bombers, to the National Army authorities. According to a certain other newspaper, representatives sent by the Republican government arrived in the city of Burgos on the 23rd of this month and proposed peace conditions, but General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the National Army, refused to consider them and only demanded that the Republican government authorities surrender within 48 hours, (Havas, 25th).

Burgos: Eleven warships belonging to the Republican government fled from the southern port of Cartagena to the French port of Bizerte in North Africa, and were detained by the French authorities. According to official news here, the French government has decided to hand them over to the National Army government. It is reported that the Republican government's destroyer "José Luis Díaz," after being detained in the British port of Gibraltar, was handed over to the National Army government by the British authorities yesterday, (Havas, 25th).

(Paris) The first ambassador to France from the Spanish National Army government, Lequerica, arrived here in the afternoon today and immediately made a statement to the press, saying, "I am very happy to be ordered to come to France and do my best for the work of pacification. I hope that the agreement signed between the French representative Pétain in the city of Burgos and our government will be implemented quickly, so that bilateral relations can become closer in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding," (Havas, 25th).

(London) According to today's London Times, representatives of the Spanish National Army government will sign a concordat in the near future. It also reports that General Franco intends to reciprocate with visits to Rome to meet with Mussolini and General Göring, (Haitong, 26th).

### Failure of European Collective Security Plan: Disappointment Among Majority of US Legislators

British Newspapers Also Express Discontent

Massive Anti-German Demonstration in New York with 100,000 Participants

The diplomatic correspondent of the London Observer claims that the anti-aggression declaration of the four powers – Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland – has now been abandoned. The Polish government has shown no interest in participating in this demonstration, believing that its only practical purpose is to create the possibility of international consultation if Poland is subjected to German aggression. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's proposal to provide substantial military assistance, agreeing to take immediate action in the event of German aggression or the threat of aggression, is also not valued by Warsaw, as the Poles still adhere to their long-standing principle of maintaining complete neutrality in the disputes between Germany and the Soviet Union. In the current situation, the Polish opinion is that they do not welcome Soviet troops entering their territory, regardless of their purpose, and they do not attempt to conceal this. The French government is not particularly regretting the failure of the four-power declaration plan, and believes that the obligations borne by the British and French governments will be limited to dealing with German aggression in Western Europe. Although the Soviet government did not include the Far East in the scope of negotiations, it insists that only complete restraint by Britain and the Soviet Union, taking military action against Germany, can curb its aggression. This restraint should be equally applied to German aggression in both East and West. The Soviet Union's intention is that Britain and the Soviet Union should have military restraint in both Eastern and Western Europe. The minimum requirement on the British side should be to immediately declare war on Germany and immediately send a fleet to blockade Germany, (Reuters, 26th).

(London) This Sunday, British newspapers discussed the events of the past week, frankly admitting the failure of Britain's planned policy of resisting aggression. At the same time, they also criticized Britain's attempt to join hands with the Soviet Union to jointly oppose it, and Britain's failure to persuade Poland to unreservedly support Britain. The Observer commented that the four-power declaration proposal has clearly become a pie in the sky. Even the London Times implies a warning, saying that Britain's plan to hope for complete support from the Soviet Union, Poland, and Romania may not be as desired, (Haitong, 26th).

(Washington) US political figures recently stated that the attempt by European countries threatened by German imperialism to form a united front has failed. As a result, US congressmen who support the government's current policy are also disappointed. The purpose of President Roosevelt's policy is to adjust all the forces of the world's anti-totalitarianists, so as to restore the principle of collective security. In his view, the only effective way to establish lasting peace is to establish a collective security organization. Although many in Congress have expressed support for this proposition, if people's efforts in this regard are frustrated, the psychology of Congressmen will inevitably be affected. Judging from the fact that the majority of non-isolationist senators clearly stated yesterday that it is inappropriate to amend the Neutrality Act at this time, it can be seen that these senators hold no more than three arguments: (1) The United States has condemned Germany's actions in the Czech Republic and imposed additional taxes on the country's imported goods to show "punishment." It has already done its part. If European countries directly threatened by Germany cannot further cooperate, then the United States has no reason to take a more serious stance. (2) President Roosevelt knows that totalitarianism is enough to threaten the principles of democracy, so he is unwilling to make any concessions to totalitarian countries. However, British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons the other day stated that ideological differences are not enough to hinder peace. This view is completely contrary to President Roosevelt's original position. (3) If the current Neutrality Act is amended at this time, general public opinion will believe that the United States is accepting new constraints to support Britain and France. On the contrary, Britain and France have failed to unite the related countries to resist Germany, and US public opinion is already somewhat disgusted. The Chicago Daily News recently stated that the recent events are the natural result of the Munich Agreement. "If the world wants to stop Germany from advancing, it should have done so before the Munich Agreement." Other newspapers said that after Germany annexed the Czech Republic and recovered the Memel region, its power has greatly increased, and the threatened countries still cannot find a constructive way to restore order and curb the advancement of the aggressor countries. In this situation, the US Congress and general public opinion believe that the attitude adopted by the government in the future should be to observe the situation quietly. If there are new actions, it is already felt that it is not very appropriate and useless, (Havas, 25th).

(New York) Republican Senator Borah recently made a speech attacking Britain, with very harsh words, saying that Germany's annexation of Austria and the split of the Czech Republic were actually encouraged by Britain. Britain can be called Hitler's ally. "In short, the democratic countries of Europe only want to pursue imperialism and destroy national socialism. The United States should not help them. When war breaks out in Europe in the future, I will neither agree to supply any participating country with cash or military supplies, nor do I want to see Americans sacrifice for the conspiracies of European imperialism," Senator Borah said. It is reported that some aspects of the US political circle are quite distressed because the democratic countries of Europe have failed to form a group to deal with national socialist Germany effectively. This can be seen from the remarks of Borah and certain members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, (Havas, 26th).

(New York) An anti-German demonstration was held here this afternoon, with no less than 100,000 participants. Among them, there were many overseas Chinese from Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Poland, all wearing their national costumes, which was quite eye-catching. The demonstrators held banners with various anti-German and anti-fascist slogans, and shouted, "European countries should resist German aggression." Although the number of participants was large, the order was well-maintained. When they arrived at Columbus Circle, Mayor LaGuardia gave a speech to them, fiercely criticizing Germany. At that time, former Czech President Beneš and former ambassador to Britain Masaryk were both silently sitting on the podium. LaGuardia's words said that Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic was an international atrocity. A certain country is acting recklessly, arbitrarily destroying the independence of other countries, infringing on the borders of other countries, and occupying the cities of other countries. The world will have no peace and happiness. I now express my deep sympathy to the Czech nation in the name of the citizens of New York, (Havas, 25th).

San Francisco: Many people recently held a demonstration near the German consulate, protesting against Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic. They also sent four representatives to the German consulate to deliver a letter of protest. Consul General Wiedemann immediately met them, but refused to accept the letter of protest and declared to the representatives, "The consulate has no right to interfere in political events. If the representatives have any opinions, they should submit them to the German Embassy in Washington." The representatives had no choice but to retreat without success, (Havas, 25th).

### US Legislative Amendment Issue

Attacks by Thomas

Proposal by Pittman

(Washington) Democratic Congressman Thomas criticized the new Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Pittman last night, regarding the "cash and carry" clause as unethical because this clause is obviously unfavorable to the invaded country. Thomas stated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Pittman's proposal would favor the aggressor countries, because when comparing the aggressor countries with the invaded countries, the aggressor countries often have larger wallets than the invaded countries. In addition, it will give the world a bad impression, regarding the United States as a purely cash-and-carry shop, believing that the United States' policy is completely based on commercialism and is no different from the gold-dollar diplomacy of the 19th century, and repeating the mistake of the neutral commercial rights that were involved in the European war. According to Thomas, the United States' hope for peace cannot be limited to the unity of the Western Hemisphere, and at the same time, its neutrality law must be "ethical, fair, selfless, and worthy of conscience," (Associated Press, 26th).

(New York) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to discuss the issue of amending the current Neutrality Act on the 29th of this month. According to the New York Times, the members of the committee have conflicting opinions and can be divided into six factions: 1. Supporters of the Pittman bill, advocating allowing belligerent countries to purchase military equipment and various raw materials from the United States, but they must purchase with cash and transport them on their own. 2. Those who advocate authorizing the president to prohibit aggressor countries from purchasing military equipment and raw materials in the United States. 3. Those who advocate directly abolishing the current Neutrality Act. 4. Those who advocate deleting the provision in the current Neutrality Act that prohibits the export of military supplies. 5. Those who oppose the Pittman bill. 6. Those who intend to consider the situation and decide their attitude when the discussion begins, (Havas, 26th).

### Armistice Reached Between Hungarian and Slovakian Armies

Joint Committee Formed

To Handle Border Disputes

Mr. Plessinger, Commander of the Slovakian National Army, recently stated in an interview with a Havas News Agency reporter that his country and the Hungarian National Army have agreed on an armistice. However, the Hungarian army is still constructing defensive fortifications in the occupied areas and expelling residents. (Havas News Agency, 25th)

Hungarian City: Regarding the border dispute between Hungary and Slovakia, the Hungarian government requested that Slovakia send representatives for negotiations. The Slovakian authorities recently responded, agreeing and expressing their willingness to demarcate the border according to the division between Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia in the former Czechoslovak Republic. It is understood that both sides will begin negotiations here on the 27th of this month. The Hungarian government will then declare that it intends to base its claims on various principles, insisting that certain areas of Slovakia inhabited by Hungarians should belong to Hungary and be temporarily occupied by the Hungarian army. (Havas News Agency, 25th)

Prague: The Hungarian-Slovakian Joint Committee is scheduled to meet on March 27th to address the armed conflict situation. (Reuters, 25th)

Berlin: News of contact between Hungarian and Slovakian troops has been banned from publication by local authorities. So far, official circles seem to support Hungary's expansion. It is argued that the border between Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia in the former Czechoslovakia was merely an administrative division and not based on ethnic principles. Therefore, Hungary's actions cannot be considered an invasion of the Slovakian border. However, as Slovakia is under German protection, Germany does not want to disappoint it. This is why Germany is maintaining silence. (Havas News Agency, 25th)

(Rome) Foreign Minister Ciano received British Chargé d'Affaires Sir Noel Charles this afternoon. According to reliable sources, Charles told Ciano that the British government is concerned about the situation in Hungary and Slovakia, as well as Romania. Ciano replied that the Italian government believes there is no need for concern. In addition, Charles explained the British government's response to Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Ciano then met with Hungarian Ambassador Mr. Rolanyi to discuss the current situation in Hungary and Slovakia, as well as Romania. (Havas News Agency, 25th)

### Provincial Government Actively Planning to Improve Fujian's Specialty Products

Mechanized Tea Production Already Showing Success

Sugar Industry Undergoing Concrete Improvements

Fuzhou Correspondence: Fujian Province's main agricultural exports include tea, tobacco, sugarcane, and fruits. Tea exports in the past amounted to tens of millions of yuan annually. At its peak, Yongding shredded tobacco alone had an annual output of three to four million yuan. Sugarcane, as the raw material for sugar production, had annual domestic sales of over two million dan (a unit of weight) before the import of foreign sugar. Fruits such as tangerines, pomelos, lychees, longans, olives, and flowers like daffodils and gladioli were regularly shipped to other regions, often reaching several million yuan annually. Later, due to competition from foreign goods and substitutions, exports declined. In recent years, the Fujian provincial authorities have been actively promoting production and making every effort to improve these agricultural exports in order to restore their former glory. The progress of each improvement is described below: Improvement of Tea: A. Tea: To revitalize the tea industry, the Fujian provincial government, in addition to establishing tea warehouses to manage transportation and sales, and conducting tea inspections, specifically established the Tea Improvement Farm in Fuan in 1935. The farm includes a tea plantation, divided into flatland and mountainous areas. The flatland area of thirty-six mu (a unit of area) serves as a various experimental zone, conducting various cultivation experiments on tea trees. The mountainous area of over two hundred mu is used for ordinary tea cultivation. In addition, there is an attached tea processing factory equipped with modern machinery, including engines, rolling machines, lump-breaking machines, screening machines, and drying machines. Tea production began in 1937, marking the first mechanized tea production in Fujian Province. In that year, eighty-one boxes were produced, with the highest price reaching seventy-five taels (a unit of weight) per hundred jin (another unit of weight), exceeding the general tea price in Fuan by twenty taels. In 1938, the original plan was to produce eighty boxes, but due to various reasons, only twenty-eight boxes were produced. However, the quality, such as the strip shape and aroma, was more advanced than before. The Provincial Tea Management Office shipped them to Hong Kong, where they fetched a price of one hundred and thirty Hong Kong dollars per hundred market catties (a unit of weight), breaking the highest price record for tea in Fuan and Shouning counties. Tea processing improvement can be said to have achieved initial success. As for the promotion of tea technology, the Tea Improvement Farm has demonstration tea gardens and specially contracted tea gardens for tea farmers to observe and learn from. Staff are also sent to tea estates near the tea farm to guide tea processing and box packaging improvement methods, with the aim of promoting improvement work.

Planning to Establish a Tobacco Factory: B. Tobacco: Regarding the improvement of tobacco, the Fujian provincial government originally planned to establish a tobacco experiment station in Yongding, but it did not materialize. In the autumn of 1938, the Agricultural Improvement Bureau specifically purchased a large batch of tobacco seeds from Sichuan, totaling more than two hundred varieties, some of which were American varieties suitable for manufacturing cigarettes. They were trial-planted in Liancheng, Yongding, and other places. In Liancheng, the Agricultural Improvement Bureau conducted the trial planting itself. In Yongding, the bureau jointly established a farm with the county government and specially contracted farmers for trial planting. In other places, the planting was handed over to the Provincial Cooperative Affairs Management Office, which distributed the seeds to rural cooperatives in fragrant areas for trial planting and experimentation. If the results are excellent, the government will establish a cigarette factory to produce its own cigarettes, then it will not be difficult to plug the leakage of several million yuan per year, and Fujian's tobacco industry can also restore its former prosperity!

Sugar Industry: C. Sugarcane: Sugarcane in Fujian Province is mostly produced in southern Fujian, where the land is fertile and the climate is mild, and is used as a raw material for sugar production. In recent years, due to China's increase in foreign sugar tariffs, the sales of Fujian sugar have recovered, and the number of people engaged in sugarcane cultivation has gradually increased. Excellent varieties and new machinery have also been imported from foreign countries, resulting in a significant increase in production. Taking Putian and Xianyou counties as examples, the sugar produced in 1936 was statistically worth more than five million yuan. Later, the Japanese broke through our customs barriers through smuggling, and after the start of the war, the port was blockaded by the Japanese, resulting in poor sales and difficulties in the lives of sugarcane farmers. The sugar industry in Fujian Province is unlikely to revive during the war. However, the promotion and encouragement of the sugarcane sugar industry by the Fujian provincial authorities in recent years are worth mentioning.

Selecting Sugarcane Varieties: The original bamboo sugarcane in Fujian Province has stems as thin as bamboo. Although its drought resistance is strong, the yield of sugarcane stems is too small, and the sugar content is not high. The Fujian provincial government believes that if sugar industry is to be developed, sugarcane varieties must be improved first. In the spring of 1935, loans were provided to sugarcane farmers in Xianyou County who were planting Taiwanese sugarcane varieties. At the same time, staff were sent to various counties in southern Fujian to investigate sugarcane varieties and cultivation conditions. It was believed that the Javanese large-stem sugarcane varieties imported by the people in recent years were of excellent quality and suitable for cultivation in Fujian Province. However, the quantity was too small to be popularized, so the Zhangpu Bangxiang Farm was entrusted to specifically cultivate five million Javanese sugarcane seedlings, which were promoted to various counties in southern Fujian at no cost or low cost in the spring of 1936. At that time, due to inconvenient transportation, only over one million three hundred thousand plants were trial-planted in nine counties including Longxi. Farmers were provided with loans of ten yuan per mu by the government for sugarcane seeds and fertilizer expenses when cultivating Javanese sugarcane seedlings. Although it could not be fully popularized for a while, farmers welcomed the Javanese sugarcane varieties. After repeated propagation, the number of excellent Javanese sugarcane varieties in southern Fujian has greatly increased compared to before. Regarding the sugarcane trial planting project, the Fujian provincial government has established the Zhangpu Farm, newly opening up over four hundred mu of land for sugarcane trial planting and improvement. After testing, it was believed that Javanese sugarcane varieties were far superior to local sugarcane varieties. The sugarcane planting season should be changed from spring planting to autumn planting. In addition, sugarcane fertilizer experiments and drought-resistant cultivation experiments were conducted, and the results were very satisfactory.

Providing Loans and Assistance: In addition to improving sugarcane, the Fujian provincial government is planning to establish large-scale factories on one hand and is making every effort to support the development of private sugarcane sugar enterprises on the other. For example, the Zhangpu Fengxiang Farm was specifically reorganized by the Construction Department from 1937, with an investment of thirty thousand yuan, and was transformed into a joint public-private venture to serve as a demonstration of small-scale mechanized sugar production in rural southern Fujian. In addition, the Zainei Farm in Longxi, the Dahe Farm in Yongchun, the Wenling Sugarcane Company in Nan'an, and the Jiaosaka Farm in Tongan have all received funds from the provincial government to provide assistance and loans for their development.

### Germany Declares No Intention to Invade Poland

(Berlin) An article authorized by the German government's foreign intelligence agency stated that Germany has absolutely no intention of invading Poland. Germany recognizes the existence of a strong Poland as a political necessity and an indispensable factor in maintaining order in Eastern Europe. Now that Poland and Hungary have established a common border, various rumors about Germany's plan to expand eastward will be dispelled without argument. (Reuters, 25th)

Warsaw: The Polish-Military Relations Newspaper today published an editorial stating that no matter how strong the enemy is, we are prepared to fight them. Poles are not weak and are not intimidated by the enemy's superior forces and equipment, nor are they intimidated by the enemy's exaggerated rhetoric. Poland's own large number of soldiers, high morale, sophisticated equipment, and the courage and unyielding spirit of the people are sufficient to win. We firmly believe that our bayonets will defeat the enemy. (Reuters, 25th)

### British-Russian Talks Approaching; Russia Does Not Request British Assistance in the Far East; Japanese Concern Over Vladivostok Fleet Strength

(Tokyo) The Japanese side is greatly concerned about the potential strength of the Soviet Navy in Vladivostok. According to recent Japanese sources, Vladivostok has seven refurbished cruisers (two of 5,000 to 6,000 tons and four of 3,000 to 4,000 tons), seven destroyers, eighty submarines, one hundred and forty high-speed motor vessels, totaling two hundred and forty-one vessels, six hundred aircraft, and two thousand pilots. (Reuters, 25th)

(London) The Observer stated that rumors that the Soviet Union would propose to Britain that Britain must support the Soviet Union in the Far East to contain Japan as an exchange condition for Soviet assistance to Britain in Europe are completely unfounded. The Soviet Union has never included this condition in its communications to Britain and France. The Soviet Union has also stated that it is capable of handling Japan on its own. (Reuters, 25th)

(London) British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson and Soviet Deputy People's Commissar Mikoyan held day-long talks in Moscow to discuss British-Soviet trade relations. They have now reached a concrete stage and will continue talks later this week. (Reuters, 25th)

(Moscow) British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson, after arriving here yesterday, continued talks with the People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, Mikoyan. At noon, Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov hosted a banquet. So far, the discussions have been limited to commercial issues, but the British delegation makes no secret of the fact that the main focus of this trip is political issues. (Havas News Agency, 25th)

### What Kind of Love Can Be Considered Understanding the True Meaning of Love?

In society, unsatisfactory marital matches often lead to endless suffering. This is truly caused by incorrect and flawed marital concepts. Therefore, you must recognize that the fundamental concept of marriage is that a man and a woman obtain a lifelong and closest relationship with each other as "themselves," not that "parents" are "choosing a son-in-law" or "taking a daughter-in-law." Therefore, marriage can never be decided by parents. So young people should choose good spouses and good husbands for themselves.

Although young people should choose their own spouses, how should they go about getting good spouses? This requires a process, and this process is "love"! Homa Hisao said: "Marriage is based on love; if there is no love, no matter what conditions are met, marriage becomes an inherited and commercial transaction." Ellen Key also said: "No matter what kind of marriage, if there is love, it is moral; even if it has gone through legal procedures, if there is no love, it is immoral." So we know that love is the first requirement, the core and element of marriage; only a marriage that is based on genuine love between both parties is reasonable.

Here, you must first understand the true meaning of love! Love is a special affection between opposite sexes that originates from health. However, you cannot think of it as a simple reproductive impulse; reproductive activity that reaches a healthy state can establish love!

Many young people do not have the true meaning of love and often disregard the health of their reproductive functions, so they will have marital discord after marriage.

Speaking of the reasons for reproductive dysfunction, premarital masturbation and debauchery, and excessive indulgence after marriage are the most common. Therefore, the development of physical and mental abilities is hindered, which promotes spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, vaginal discharge, neurasthenia, infertility after marriage, and premature aging, which is a major reason. Since reproductive power is decadent and weak, the love between husband and wife only extends to the surface. In short, it lacks sexual love.

Those who are now suffering from the above-mentioned diseases, why not seek medical treatment early, so as not to damage love for a long time? According to my years of treatment experience, the German testicular essence preparation "Bu Ti Kang" for men is the most effective remedy! Since its introduction, it has been unanimously praised by world-renowned doctors. I often try it on patients with brain weakness, kidney deficiency, and premature ejaculation, and it is always effective. The female "Bu Ti Kang" is especially a sacred medicine for regulating menstruation and promoting conception!

### Causes of Spermatorrhea and Seminal Emission Caused by Masturbation

— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Why does masturbation cause spermatorrhea and seminal emission? The reason is very clear. Masturbation can make the erection nerves and ejaculation center oversensitive, so unconscious emission of semen will occur during deep sleep and unconsciously. The number of times gradually increases, causing sperm and blood to deplete, so the opportunity for metabolism gradually slows down. As a result, the brain nerves, sexual nerves, and spinal cord are greatly damaged, leading to all kinds of weakness symptoms!

Due to the habit of masturbation, even if spermatorrhea has broken out, if one can recognize the harm and quit it as soon as possible, all harms can be avoided. However, there are many popular treatments now, such as using cold water to rub the local area before going to bed, electrical therapy, prostate massage, and internal medicine, etc. Based on my experience of more than ten years of clinical practice, I deeply understand that there is no careful health regimen, and taking "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets" before going to bed is more effective. Other methods can only be used as aids. The effect of cold water massage and electrotherapy does not go beyond the scope of massage, while the "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets" have the power to reach the sperm barrier and also have the effect of calming the brain nerves. If you have suffered from frequent spermatorrhea and do not have neurasthenia and other symptoms, taking "Bu Ti Kang" at the same time is very effective.

### What is: Gonorrhea's Deadly Enemy?

— Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

What is gonorrhea's deadly enemy? This sentence seems abrupt on the surface. But in fact, this disease of gonorrhea really makes people have a headache, but I don't know that this kind of gonorrhea, which is unrestrained and unscrupulous, has indeed reached its end. Because gonorrhea is the most difficult venereal disease to treat, it has strong resistance and cunning escape methods. Once infected with gonorrhea, if it is not completely cured, it will never be cured. Therefore, there is the slogan that there is no cure for gonorrhea.

However, science is progressing, and medicine is also advancing rapidly. This gonorrhea, which was once regarded as incurable, now has the invention of a special drug for gonorrhea, "Ke Lin Nong." This drug is made of a special protein color mixture using scientific methods, so it has absolutely no crude and impure ingredients, and has no adverse side effects. Therefore, it has special effects when used for general gonorrhea symptoms. Please read the following points, and you can understand:

First: The bactericidal effect of "Ke Lin Nong" is extremely rapid. After taking this drug in a short period of time, an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect occurs. This effect can directly reach the lesion and surround and annihilate all gonococci. Wherever gonococci are located, the bactericidal effect of "Ke Lin Nong" will track and reach them. Therefore, once "Ke Lin Nong" is taken, gonorrhea will be cured. Regardless of prostatitis, orchitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, arthritis, etc. in acute and chronic gonorrhea, and women's gonorrheal leucorrhea, vaginitis, cervicitis, ovaritis, etc., can all be cured by taking "Ke Lin Nong." However, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and women can use "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. They can all use self-treatment at home according to the diagrams and instructions, which is especially simple and practical. Having said this, "Ke Lin Nong" is the deadly enemy of conquering all stages of gonorrhea. Therefore, it can be popular all over the world, and experts unanimously praise its use. Without actual results, how could there be such achievements!

### The Future of Cough

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Coughing seems to be an experience that everyone has, but many causes of cough are not easy to cure. Coughing incessantly, or dry cough without phlegm, or coughing up phlegm unsatisfactorily, or coughing up a lot of phlegm like fluff, or coughing up blood in the phlegm, in short, if the cough is not cured, the future is very dangerous. Nineteen out of ten Chinese people have latent lung disease. Usually, because the resistance is strong, it surrounds the tuberculosis bacteria on all sides, but the resistance often disappears due to coughing. This tuberculosis bacteria breaks through and comes out, like a tiger out of its cage. It acts recklessly, so after coughing, it is followed by tuberculosis, which is especially common. In order to prevent cough from worsening and overtaking the situation, it is necessary to quickly cure the cough. "Bu Fei Na Er" is the only special medicine for relieving cough and eliminating phlegm. Regardless of the first, second, or third stage of lung disease, it is always effective and has long been praised by Chinese and foreign lung disease experts.

### Gonorrheal Cystitis Can Cause Death

It is not uncommon for us to see clinically patients die from gonorrhea. Gonorrheal cystitis, which is often overlooked by the general public, also poses a dangerous risk of causing critical conditions. Originally, gonorrheal cystitis is caused by gonococci invading the bladder. Because the bladder is the storage place for urine, its symptoms are frequent urination, often thirty or forty times a day. Often, after only a few minutes, one wants to urinate again. Especially at night, it is even more frequent, leading to insomnia and neurasthenia. In addition, after urination, pain occurs from the lower abdomen to the urethra. The urine discharged is very thin, far less thick than when healthy. Severely, this kind of pain is too much. Therefore, urination is more difficult. Also, according to our daily practical experience, because there is pus in the urine, it appears turbid milky white, and sometimes blood urine is discharged. What is even more terrifying is that once it becomes chronic and urination is not smooth, the amount of residual urine accumulated in the bladder increases day by day, causing it to be too full. If not rescued urgently, death will result from uremia.

The treatment of this disease must not be done with slow and inappropriate methods, because this kind of treatment is of no help to this kind of cystitis, which is as urgent as a shooting star. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly perform a surgical operation to remove the residual urine in order to alleviate the condition. Otherwise, complications will inevitably arise, making treatment even more hesitant. In recent years, for patients with gonorrheal cystitis who have become uremic, I have used surgical removal. For general gonorrheal cystitis, warm compress therapy is performed on the lower abdomen, as well as German electrostatic therapy. At the same time, the gonorrhea holy medicine "Ke Lin Nong" is taken internally, so that it can directly produce bactericidal, anti-gonorrheal, anti-inflammatory, and diuretic effects on the lesions. Then, the attached bacteria attached to the bladder and other parts will be eliminated and cleared in one fell swoop, and it will be difficult to leak out. However, many patients indulge in the habit of procrastination and refuse to quickly carry out effective remedies for this gonorrhea, which is like a flood and a ferocious beast. Is it not a pity that those who die from uremia! Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, twenty numbers will be given out every day, and each number will cost only five cents.

Attached notice: Bu Ti Kang for men and women is each five yuan per bottle. Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Tablets are two yuan per bottle. Bu Fei Na Er is two yuan and five cents per bottle. Ke Lin Nong is two yuan and five cents per bottle. Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets are two yuan and five cents per bottle. Anti-Gonorrhea Water is two yuan and five cents per bottle. All pharmacies are available. For out-of-town mail orders, please remit money directly to Hai Mi Deng Pharmacy, No. 9 Ningbo Road, British Concession, Shanghai, and it will be sent immediately.

### British Far East Fleet Commander, Nobel, Visits Siam and Expresses Optimism About China's Prospects in the War of Resistance

Bangkok Correspondence: The Siamese government recently promulgated a new regulation requiring Chinese immigrants to pay a residence tax of 200 baht per person (approximately equivalent to 600 yuan in national currency). It also increased import duties on Chinese goods by one-fifth compared to last year and frequently engaged in actions that suppressed the patriotic movements of overseas Chinese. Vice Admiral Nobel, commander of the British Far East Fleet, visited the Philippines and its coastal defenses this spring. On March 1st, he visited Macau and on the 4th, in Hong Kong, he consulted with Tanaka, a staff officer of the Japanese army in Guangzhou, regarding the Luohu bombing incident. On the 6th, he flew to the flagship Kent, the flagship of Flower Moff, to

Singapore for a Review

Passing through the Gulf of Siam, he arrived in Bangkok on the 10th. The British Minister to Siam arranged a welcoming ceremony. At 5:30 AM on the 10th, the Siamese Minister of Defense, Minister of the Navy, and others sent representatives, along with personnel from the British Legation, to welcome him at Paknam. The flagship Kent had too deep a draft to navigate upstream on the Chao Phraya River, so he transferred to the Siamese shallow-draft warship Pra Rong to reach Bangkok. The Flower Moff docked at the British oil company wharf. The British commander first laid a wreath at the monument to the fallen soldiers of the European War and then visited the Regency Council, the State Council, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and others. In the afternoon at 4 PM, Siamese military and political figures paid a return visit to the Flower Moff. The Minister of Defense hosted a banquet that evening, lasting for four days.

The Entertainment Was Extremely Cordial, the Significance Great, and Unprecedented. It was not until the afternoon of the 14th that the British commander boarded his ship and departed Siam for Singapore to participate in the Singapore defense exercises on the 16th to test whether Far Eastern defenses were secure. A reporter boarded the Flower Moff to interview him. The Siamese Minister of Defense happened to be present, and as both men were about to disembark to sightsee, they could not speak freely. According to the British commander, his impressions from visiting various places were that peace in the Far East had better prospects for development and was entering a better phase. Regarding

The Sino-Japanese War, he did not want to express any opinion but only said that China's prospects in the war of resistance had entered a favorable stage. His demeanor was serious and his tone was assertive and forceful when he spoke. We can anticipate that this trip by the British commander will have good results. Furthermore, two US Class A cruisers of over 10,000 tons, the "Augusta" and the "Marblehead," followed the British commander in visiting Siam. These ships came from the Philippines and stopped at Singapore to observe the exercises. Recently, within a month, the navies of France, Britain, and the United States have all visited Siam. The safety of the Nanyang region and Siam's future direction are indeed worthy of the world's attention.

### Gulangyu's Terror Deepens

Gulangyu Correspondence: After the fall of Xiamen, Gulangyu, just a short distance away, has become a dark and terrifying world under the threat of the Japanese army. Recently, the Japanese consulate in Gulangyu has been exerting its power wantonly, dispatching large numbers of combat troops, fully armed, acting as if facing a major enemy, rushing around everywhere searching for young people. As a result, Li Jiaji, a member of the Gulangyu Board of Trustees, and Reverend Ying, the head of the International Relief Food Division, were arrested one after the other. Such brutal acts are too numerous to mention. Fortunately, there are many foreigners in Gulangyu who, witnessing the Japanese army's frenzy and in order to maintain the peace and order of Gulangyu and protect their own interests, the French Consul came forward to negotiate. The Japanese side also realized that sending troops to rush around every day was meaningless, so they took the opportunity to temporarily soften their approach and instead dispatched detectives in groups to openly and secretly investigate on the streets and alleys. More than 20 people have been arrested. It is said that on January 13th, 13 patriotic compatriots were brutally murdered. At the same time, detectives were dispatched to patrol refugee shelters. Any young person who caught their attention was interrogated and detained. At night, under the pretext of arresting unstable elements, they scaled walls and sneaked in, engaging in rape, robbery, and other bandit-like activities. The innocent refugees suffered terribly and could only swallow their anger and weep silently. Gulangyu was originally known as a "Shangri-La," but now it has become a dark and terrifying world.

### Indiscriminate Bombing by Aircraft, Japanese Warships Attempt to Harass the Fujian Coast Without Success, All Warships Have Turned and Sailed to Xiamen

Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the beginning of January this year, when Japanese warships harassed Xiutu in Jinjiang County and Xia'an in Hui'an County on the Fujian coast, no aircraft or warships have been seen for two months, and the area has been very peaceful. However, the Japanese side recently had another attempt to invade the Fujian coast. On the 6th of this month, nine Japanese warships suddenly arrived from Xiamen and anchored off the coasts of Haicheng, Tong'an, Jinjiang, and Hui'an counties, dividing and stationing themselves in the waters of Haicang, Jimei, Xiutu, and Xia'an. They launched speedboats to intercept passing civilian ships (a total of three ships were seized, resulting in losses of more than 40,000 yuan) and inspected foreign merchant ships. On the 7th, Japanese warships anchored in Tong'an opened fire on Jimei three times from 3:00 AM to 9:00 AM, totaling 18 shots, destroying one civilian house and killing one water buffalo. Japanese warships anchored in Haicheng opened fire on Haicang once, totaling nine shots, all of which landed on the beach or in wasteland, causing no losses. On the afternoon of the 8th, four aircraft took off from Japanese warships anchored in Hui'an, scouting the counties of Haicheng, Longxi, Nan'an, Tong'an, Jinjiang, and Hui'an. They dropped bombs in three locations in Tong'an County (Jimei), Jinjiang County (Anbu), and Hui'an County (Xiutu). A total of 19 bombs were dropped in Jimei, damaging the Jimei Wharf and Jimei Elementary School. Six bombs were dropped in Anbu, and dozens of machine gun rounds were fired, destroying 18 civilian ships and one house, killing 12 civilians and wounding 12. Five bombs were dropped in Xiutu, sinking three civilian ships. By the 9th, the Japanese warships, having achieved their disruptive purposes, all

Sailed Back to Xiamen

And a small aircraft carrier, anchored off the mouth of the Min River in Fuzhou, the waters of Nan Gantang in Lianjiang County, the East Sha Island of Mazu, and the Meihua Port of Changle County, launched speedboats to raid and seize four fishing boats and two cargo ships, all of which were set on fire. The fate of the crew members is unknown. From 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM on the 10th, aircraft took off from the aircraft carrier four times, scouting the Min River estuary. Fuzhou issued air raid alerts four times. The aircraft also dropped bombs at Changmen twice, totaling six bombs, all of which landed in the mountains without causing any damage. On the morning of the 11th, eight aircraft again took off from the aircraft carrier and went to Lianjiang and Changchong to scout the coast, dropping four bombs in Guantou, Lianjiang County, sinking one barge, killing one person and injuring three. Two Japanese warships also arrived in Pinghai, Putian County, on the 10th from Xiamen. Each carried one aircraft, and on the afternoon of the 11th, they flew to the coastlines of Fuzhou, Putian, Xianyou, and Hui'an counties for reconnaissance. The two warships then sailed to Chongwu in Hui'an County and fired tens of thousands of shells at the shore in the evening, all of which landed on the beach. By the morning of the 12th, the three warships and aircraft carrier anchored outside the Min River estuary had all sailed to the Baiquan waters and could no longer be seen from Worry Gate. The two warships anchored in Chongwu sailed towards Xiamen. The harassment of the coastal areas for several days has now

Finally Ended Peacefully

However, according to general observations, the Japanese side's combat power in China is weakening daily. In the plains of Ningbo, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, there is no defense to hold. Guerrilla forces come and go freely, exhausting the Japanese army and making it impossible to cope. Although the southeast of Fujian Province is coastal, a few dozen or a hundred or so miles inland, there are undulating mountains and dense forests, making it a natural guerrilla area. Moreover, the people are brave and good at fighting, and there are many hidden guns, making it an excellent place for guerrilla forces. It will definitely not be easy for the Japanese side to occupy it.

### Japanese Troops Harass Jiangyin, Puppet Detective Chief Killed

Changyinsha Correspondence: The situation in southeast Jiangyin has been tense recently. Although the Japanese troops entrenched in the city are carrying out unusually tight defense measures, a Japanese soldier in plain clothes was wounded at Puxie Bridge, a small market about a mile outside the east gate, the day before yesterday. The Japanese army, claiming it was a guerrilla base, set it on fire, and more than 60 houses were burned to the ground. On the morning of the 21st, Yang Hanqing, a detective chief of the Japanese special forces, was shot and killed. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese side closed the city gates and launched a major search, only apprehending dozens of suspects, all of whom were taken to the Kempeitai headquarters at the Zhang family's mansion on West Street and subjected to torture. However, no clues have been found so far.

### Jiangsu Self-Defense Force Headquarters Ordered to Be Abolished

Qin County Correspondence: In accordance with the provisions of the wartime national military training program, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has ordered the abolition of the Provincial People's Self-Defense Force Headquarters and transferred its affairs to the National Military Training Department. Yesterday, special notices were distributed to all counties to comply and report on the handling of handover procedures. It is reported that all matters concerning the Provincial People's Self-Defense Force Headquarters will henceforth be handled by the National Military Training Department.

### Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Changzhou, Chinese Forces Score Repeated Victories

Wujin Correspondence: A Chinese guerrilla force of more than 100 men rushed to the section from Changzhou to Lihe Bridge the day before yesterday, surrounding the puppet police station and killing two puppet police on the spot, capturing six alive, and confiscating all their weapons. However, the Japanese troops in Changzhou City learned of this and sent troops out of the city to reach Lihe Bridge. The guerrilla forces immediately dispersed and broke up the Japanese troops in separate attacks. Thirteen Japanese soldiers were killed, and many more were wounded. Fourteen rifles and two small mortars were abandoned. In addition, in Daixi Bridge Town, Dongtan Village, and behind Xishan Island in the 20-kilometer southern district, Wangting Town, Qingyang Town, and Jiuxuan Huangtang Town, fierce battles have broken out between the Chinese army's Ye Detachment and the Japanese army in recent days, and all have been recovered by the Chinese army. Recently, the Dan-Chang Highway, which the Japanese army forced the Chinese to build, was also destroyed by the Chinese army's commando unit. On the 25th, several hundred New Fourth Army troops arrived in Banshang Town and annihilated the Japanese garrison stationed in the town, and Banshang Town was immediately recovered. The Japanese army in Changzhou City was very panicked and blindly fired artillery shells outside the city day and night, destroying many houses outside the city.

### Japanese Troops in Yangzhou Suffer Setbacks

Part Surrounded and Disarmed

Taixian Correspondence: As the battle in northern Jiangsu is proceeding fiercely, the Japanese troops in the Yangzhou area are also stirring uneasily. At dawn on the 21st, about 80 Japanese troops from Fairy Maiden Town encountered a special operations commando unit of the Chinese guerrilla force in Shao Gou Village, attached to the town. Commander Hu immediately divided his troops into three routes to surround the Japanese troops, killing 13 Japanese soldiers and seizing more than 10 Type 38 rifles. At about 9:00 AM the next morning, more than 100 Japanese troops, along with several light and heavy machine guns and mortars, advanced from Li Dian Town towards Touqiao. Zhong, the leader of a detachment of the guerrilla force's Fang Detachment, immediately led his troops to meet the enemy and fired machine guns, causing the Japanese troops to flee in panic. It is reported that the Japanese army, failing in their two attempts, may continue to launch large-scale attacks. The Fang Detachment has ordered its subordinates to be on strict alert.

### Detailed Record of the Third National Education Conference (Continued 5)

Various Education Reform Programs Adopted

Motions on Special Considerations for Anti-Japanese War and National Reconstruction Education

Closing Ceremony Held and Declaration Issued

Special Correspondent Yi De of Shen Bao, Sent by Air from Chongqing

President Dai Speaks on the Problem of Social Education in China

(Special Correspondence from Chongqing) On the morning of March 8th, the Third National Education Conference held a memorial week, chaired by Chairman Chen, who invited President Dai Jitao to speak on the topic of "The Problem of Social Education in China," which has been recorded in this newspaper. President Dai delivered a speech, stating that social education is related to the survival of the nation, the life and death of the country, and the order and disorder of society. He hoped that educators across the country would rise up and lead its implementation. The individual's life is inextricably linked to society; even a simple piece of clothing is often connected to the entire world. The most important aspects of social education are four: (1) Newspapers. As a journalist, I know deeply that newspapers have great and far-reaching power in education. For the past 30 years, many orders and commands in China have been issued on Wangping Street in Shanghai. Good newspapers have a good impact on the country. (2) Next is the cinema. Following science, it becomes increasingly sophisticated day by day, entering schools at every moment, and fashionable clothes can be imitated from movies. (3) Showing the face of a country, the splendor of architecture can be called theaters. China has always used drama as an educational tool to change customs. Sichuan opera is based on dialogue, so it is no different from vernacular drama. Guangdong has seven major guilds, which perform for three days each year. The City God Temple is the largest among these seven temples, and the stage is built to be magnificent, costing more than one million yuan. Singing opera in the city connects the villagers in the surrounding countryside who come to watch the play. The depth of its penetration into the hearts of the people can be seen from this. (4) The fourth is entertainment venues, such as magic shows, martial arts performances, storytelling, big drum, money board, and storytelling performers, who have greater power than even the greatest orators. From this perspective, school education must be coordinated with social education; otherwise, ten days of exposure to the sun is not as effective as one day of frost in destroying things. Dai spoke on these four matters for an hour and a half, and his outstanding eloquence was admirable.

### Morning of the Ninth Day, Tenth General Assembly

The Third National Education Conference was originally scheduled to close on March 7th, but due to the large number of cases, it was extended for two days. On the morning of the ninth day, the ninth general assembly was held, and various education improvement programs submitted by the Ministry of Education were revised and adopted by the whole body.

Special Considerations for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction

An ad hoc motion was also passed on the "special considerations that should be given to education in the great era of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction," which was divided into (A) education institutions and (B) education administrative institutions. The considerations were: (1) The principles of education should not be changed due to wartime. (2) Strive for normal educational facilities. (3) Spiritual mobilization. (4) Establish wartime lectures. (5) Wartime service. (6) Special training in knowledge and skills. (7) Increase supplemental teaching materials at noon. (8) Strictly implement military training. (9) Special education for the masses during wartime. (10) Wartime compulsory education. (11) Accelerate the cultivation of talents needed in the present era. (12) There should be specially formed organizations. (13) Increase the salaries of education workers in the war zone. (14) When providing relief to primary and secondary school teachers in the war zone, relevant work related to the War of Resistance should be assigned.

Afternoon of the Ninth Day

Held Closing Ceremony

Chairman Chen Lifu Delivered Closing Remarks. The closing ceremony was held at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the ninth day. First, the declaration was discussed and passed, followed by Chairman Chen delivering closing remarks. In addition to thanking and accepting the proposals, he earnestly emphasized: (1) Society must understand education, and then the implementation of education will have resistance removed and dynamism increased. (2) The Three Principles of the People in practice are the spirit of creation, which is production, and this is called wisdom. Nationalism is the spirit of sacrifice, which is self-improvement, and this is called courage. Democracy is the spirit of self-government, which is unity, and this is called benevolence. (3) Advocate Chinese language, history, geography, mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Chinese history and geography create patriotic nations from the root up. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry create modern nations to catch up head-on. Educators should promote the spirit of the nation. Educators not only bear the mission of the modern age but must also see the future. In this way, one can speak of "education as a century-long plan." Common standards are essential for national construction. It is permissible to use different methods to achieve the common standards decided this time.

Jiang Menglin and Kong Xiangxi Delivered Speeches One After Another

Vice Chairman Jiang Menglin delivered a speech, which was very brief. He believed that the difference between this meeting and the previous one was that the second meeting was rich in ideals, while this one focused on facts, all of which came from the hardships of experience. Chairman Chen has high aspirations, a broad vision, and a humble heart. We should work hard to advance based on the proposals and the Ministry's intentions. Now that President Kong has been sitting here for so long, like a primary school student listening to a lecture, I would like to offer a few words and wish everyone success.

President Kong delivered a speech, which lasted about an hour, mostly to encourage people, emphasizing the need to implement moral, intellectual, and physical education. He also elaborated on the various educational discussions, earning a lot of applause.

Military Committee and Others Host Banquet for Delegates

On the evening of the ninth day, the Military Committee, the Control Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Central Party Headquarters hosted a banquet for the delegates at the old site of the military headquarters. The hosts, Chen Guofu, He Yingqin, Zhu Jiahua, and Ding Weifen, were present. Chairman Yu Youren delivered a speech during the banquet. Then, Wang Longhui reported on diplomacy, and He Yingqin reported on military affairs, lasting three hours. He reported on the current military situation and various military statistics one by one. The listeners were all invigorated.

### Zhuang Zexuan Discusses Problems in Higher Education Reform (Part 2)

Cultivate Talents for Reorganizing and Building the Interior

Cultivate Specialized Talents for Immigration and Colonizing the Border Regions

Higher education institutions that previously focused on reorganizing the interior were unfortunately located in the war zone, which forced most of them to suspend operations. Only the Jiangsu Provincial College of Education was left, having been relocated to Guangxi, while the Rural Administration Training Institute, jointly run by five universities, was relocated to Guizhou Dingfan and renamed the Rural Administration College. I believe that each province should establish such an institution, or reorganize an existing higher education institution. Of course, the work of reorganizing the interior must be carried out in close cooperation with the local government. The faculty required by such institutions should consist mainly of experts in various fields of social science. After providing students with basic training in the first year, training should focus on the urgent problems of the interior, rather than grouping students by academic departments. Training should focus on how to deal with people and things, learning from practice and teaching from practice, and jointly solving problems. The discussion of problems and the experience of various places should be exchanged for reference.

Higher education institutions that previously focused on border region development were too few, and since the War of Resistance, the need for such institutions has become even more urgent. I believe that at least three or four centers should be selected in the Northwest, Southwest, and coastal areas to concentrate human and financial resources and establish three or four higher education institutions to assist the development of border region and overseas enterprises. In the Northwest and Southwest, the application of natural sciences should be the main body of the curriculum. After providing students with basic training in the first year, training should be divided into groups in the fields of colonization, water conservancy, transportation, heavy industry, light industry, metallurgy, mining, medicine, and health. In the social sciences, emphasis should be placed on the study of cultures other than the Han Chinese. In the coastal areas, the application of social sciences should be the main body of the curriculum. After providing students with basic training in the first year, the focus of training should be on the development of education, finance, industrial and commercial enterprises, factory management, and transportation in overseas regions, with the study of cultures in various overseas regions as a common compulsory subject. Immigration work is not easy and should first be carried out on a small scale, gradually expanding. Problems encountered should be jointly studied by teachers, students, and immigrants to find solutions.

Higher education institutions that have been moved out of the war zone or were originally located in non-war zones and have not suffered great losses should continue their original work and cultivate academic and specialized talents. How to divide labor and cooperate in order to save money and achieve greater results is also worth planning comprehensively. If the entire reallocation is carried out in this way or there are too many original professors, the government should subsidize them to go abroad to teach or serve. As far as I know, overseas Chinese are very willing to pay part of the travel expenses and welcome scholars who are familiar with the situation in the motherland to give systematic academic lectures. At the same time, they can help study the methods for developing overseas enterprises. The central government may wish to follow the example of the primary and secondary school teacher service corps and organize a university professor service corps to serve overseas. If all of this can be done, it will not only help the current War of Resistance but also benefit the national rejuvenation in the future. (End)

### "North China"'s Ban on Legal Tender and Its Future

(Record of the First Symposium of This Publication)

Date: March 18th of this year, starting at 12:00 noon

Location: Conference Hall on the Fifth Floor of the Newspaper Building

Starting Point of the Discussion

Zhang Yifan:

Today, I am honored that you all have taken time out of your busy schedules to participate in this publication's symposium. This publication feels extremely honored. Each of you has profound research not only in the academic aspects of currency and finance but also in the practical aspects and the economic realities of China and Japan. What this publication would like to ask you today is about the legal tender (fabi) issue, which is currently attracting unanimous attention both domestically and internationally. That is, the legal tender issue that Japan has been trying to undermine day and night, and has been undermining for a long time, but which remains stubbornly unshaken to this day. The foundation of legal tender was originally very solid. Furthermore, the loan for the Exchange Equalization Fund established by China and the United Kingdom is even stronger, like a wall of reinforced concrete. Nevertheless, we should still discuss Japan's attitude towards legal tender and study why their sabotage efforts have continuously failed. We might as well speculate on what tricks they will play in the future. Please, gentlemen, do not hesitate to give your guidance!

Tang Qingzeng:

Regarding this issue, there can be two different views. From the perspective of the overall situation, Japan's ban on legal tender in North China may not have much effect. This is because: (1) the banknotes of the United Reserve Bank cannot circulate in areas controlled by our guerrillas; (2) the center of finance has a tendency to shift from urban areas to the interior, so the areas designated by Japan for the use of United Reserve Bank banknotes cannot have a significant effect; (3) the patriotism of the people makes them harbor a kind of discrimination against counterfeit currency. With the above three points, one can imagine that it may be somewhat impossible for Japan to immediately destroy the foundation of legal tender at present. Therefore, what we often pay attention to may be local issues, such as speculation or the black market. The key to solving these problems cannot ignore the role played by foreign banks. The fundamental solution is to concentrate all import and export foreign exchange in government-designated banks, then the power of the black market will naturally diminish day by day.

Zhang Yifan:

The main reason for the occurrence of black market venues is probably psychological. Because legal tender itself is a managed currency system, in addition to economic conditions such as gold reserves, there are also the political conditions of the country. Even the gold standard currency system will waver during wartime, let alone when the other party is trying to undermine the legal tender. If everyone can understand more about the legal tender itself and Japan's intentions towards it, then the psychological conditions will naturally become more complete.

Japanese Conspiracy Yao Qingsan:

Japan's promotion of the United Reserve Bank banknotes and the ban on legal tender in North China this time, although mainly for economic purposes, may also contain political purposes. Because changes in currency can affect people's attitudes towards the government. In other words, if legal tender is circulating in a certain place, then the people of that place hope that the legal tender will not depreciate. Therefore, they also hope that the National Government supporting the legal tender can achieve victory. If the United Reserve Bank banknotes have achieved a circulating position, then the people only have the United Reserve Bank banknotes in their hands. This may change their psychology towards the government. They may hope for the permanent existence of the North China Provisional Government. This is the reason why the Japanese government desperately wants to destroy the legal tender and desperately promote counterfeit currency. In addition, Japan wants to promote counterfeit United Reserve banknotes in North China, aiming to make North China's finance join the "Japan Group", so that it can gain many advantages in trade. Even the payment of military salaries can be done with United Reserve Bank banknotes. Using United Reserve Bank banknotes, of course, means that Japan owes money to the United Reserve Bank. To put it nicely, it can be regarded as the United Reserve Bank depositing money with the Japanese. Thus, all of Japan's expenses in North China can be paid without spending its own money. But in fact, this hope of Japan has almost completely failed. The current situation of the use of United Reserve Bank banknotes can probably be divided into three types: in the guerrilla areas, it is absolutely not used; in the concessions, it still cannot compete with legal tender. The value of legal tender is generally higher than that of United Reserve Bank banknotes; as for the so-called United Reserve Bank banknote circulation areas designated by Japan, it may be barely said to be its sphere of influence. Because in the designated areas, it is illegal to use legal tender; and it is stipulated that future money contracts must specify the number of United Reserve Bank banknotes; if legal tender is stated, the debtor can repay the debt at a 60% discount. People under this kind of pressure, of course, have to use United Reserve Bank banknotes; but this is forced use, not natural circulation. Therefore, there is no monetary credit at all, and people's hearts are still on the side of legal tender.

Zhu XX:

Chinese people support the National Government, not just for legal tender. The Japanese deliberately exaggerate this relationship to be extremely close. This is deliberately obscuring the national consciousness of China's resistance war. Japan's sabotage of legal tender has political conspiracies. Of course, we cannot deny this, but we must not believe that this is their only reason.

Liu Tiesun:

Japan's ban on legal tender in North China has both economic and political purposes. In the economic aspect, because of the ban on legal tender, Japan can block North China's resources: North China exports local products, exchanges for foreign exchange, and supplies Japan to purchase raw materials from Europe and the United States. On the other hand, it prevents North China's local products from being transported into the Central Government's sphere of influence, increasing the foreign exchange reserves of legal tender. In the political aspect, after the ban on legal tender in North China, the economic relationship between North China and the Central Government is virtually cut off. Japan hopes that it can have some effect on the people's psychology. Therefore, I believe that the method to deal with this issue should be to adopt political strategies, which is more practical.

Zhang Yifan:

Japan's absolute ban on legal tender in the occupied areas will economically create two completely different phenomena in the occupied and unoccupied areas. The circulation area of counterfeit currency is small, and Japan's attempt to concentrate the export foreign exchange of the occupied areas will naturally decrease. Isn't this a suicidal policy for them to seize export foreign exchange?

Wu Chengxi:

Cutting off the occupied areas from the non-occupied areas may not be the idea of the Japanese; however, since they now have no way to get the United Reserve Bank banknotes into the guerrilla areas, they have no choice but to create this kind of isolation first. Li Quanshi:

Therefore, the Japanese side is also divided into two factions, some advocating not to destroy the value of legal tender, and some advocating absolute destruction. Therefore, the current division into United Reserve Bank banknote areas and legal tender areas may be to save face. Sun Liyu:

When Japan initially instigated the Provisional Government to establish the "United Reserve Bank," it probably had two purposes: one was to create a new currency system in North China, linked to the Japanese yen at par, making North China join the Japanese yen group and become their economic territory; the other was to use "United Reserve Bank banknotes" as military expenses, that is, to requisition materials and reduce the burden of war expenses in other domestic regions. However, in reality, these two purposes are conflicting with each other, because to make North China join the Japanese economic group, it is necessary to maintain the value of the "United Reserve Bank banknotes" first; to raise military expenses and plunder materials from North China, it is necessary to issue "United Reserve Bank banknotes" excessively. Therefore, no matter how Japan tries to raise the value of the "United Reserve Bank banknotes," it will eventually be unable to recover its credit. The current amount of "United Reserve Bank banknotes" issued has exceeded 200 million yuan. This is not because the circulation of United Reserve Bank banknotes has increased, but it is just the result of excessively issuing its national bank notes to plunder materials. The soaring prices in North China at present precisely illustrate the severity of the local currency inflation. In short, economic matters are entirely a matter of strength. Japan's economy is weak and unable to help North China establish a new currency system; North China itself cannot obtain a large amount of foreign exchange. Failure is, of course, expected. In the future, with the depletion of the Japanese economy, the plundering of North China will become even tighter, and the credit of "United Reserve Bank banknotes" will inevitably be lost further. Their plans will eventually become dreams. This is undoubtedly true. What is hateful is that they borrowed the name of the Chinese people to plunder the materials of the Chinese people in North China, causing the people of North China to suffer extremely. This will be a major problem in the future reorganization.

Shi Yiweng:

I think there is no need to worry about the current ban on legal tender by the Japanese authorities in North China. They will not be able to ban it no matter what. This ban on legal tender was already decided when the pseudo-United Reserve Bank was established on March 10th last year. Now they want to do this, undoubtedly to implement their so-called political decrees and maintain their face. At the same time, they really hope to promote the circulation of pseudo-United Reserve Bank banknotes through this. However, the circulation of a currency must have its economic foundation. Relying solely on political power cannot be forced. The Japanese and puppet authorities in North China originally wanted to copy the old tricks in pseudo-Manchukuo: first establish a central bank, and then issue banknotes to recover the old currency. However, the situation in pseudo-Manchukuo at that time was different from the current situation in North China. The Central Bank of pseudo-Manchukuo was able to completely recover the miscellaneous banknotes within its territory within two years because (1) the pseudo-Manchukuo banknotes were backed by the Japanese yen, and the Japanese yen at that time did not depreciate and could freely purchase foreign exchange; (2) pseudo-Manchukuo's foreign trade had a surplus; (3) the quality of the miscellaneous banknotes circulating in pseudo-Manchukuo at that time was not very good. Therefore, various miscellaneous banknotes were easily defeated. However, the situation in North China is the opposite. Not only (1) the credibility of the Japanese yen—the backing of the pseudo-United Reserve Bank banknotes—is very shaky, and it is not possible to freely purchase foreign exchange; but also (2) the so-called loan of 100 million from the Japanese banking group to the pseudo-United Reserve Bank publicized by the Japanese and puppet authorities is completely a lie; (3) North China's foreign trade has a deficit; (4) Legal tender has a stable value and can purchase foreign exchange, and Chinese and foreign merchants are happy to use it. In this way, the circulation of pseudo-United Reserve Bank banknotes is naturally very weak and cannot compete with legal tender. Therefore, it is impossible for the Japanese and puppet authorities to imitate pseudo-Manchukuo.

However, one thing is worth noting: the Japanese and puppet authorities in North China are trying their best to seize the 50 million yuan of silver stored in the Tianjin concessions for themselves. Last year, the Japanese and puppet authorities repeatedly demanded that the British and French concessions hand over the silver, but this was rejected by the authorities of the British and French concessions. Later, the reason why the Japanese and puppet authorities repeatedly decided to block the British and French concessions was partly for this reason. However, the Japanese and puppet authorities did not give up because of this. Later, they once instructed Wang Zhulin, the president of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, to come forward and use the so-called "civilian" power of the silver and money industry association and the chamber of commerce to demand that the British and French concessions hand over the silver. However, Wang was assassinated and killed in December last year, so this matter was delayed. However, the Japanese and puppet authorities in North China have not given up on this matter and are still secretly proceeding. Therefore, we should always be vigilant and constantly urge friendly countries to adhere to their consistent attitude.

Tianjin Concession Side

Zhang Yifan:

Chinese banks in the Tianjin concession have accepted counterfeit currency. What is the truth? And is this related to this matter?

Wu Chengxi:

The acceptance of counterfeit currency by Chinese banks in Tianjin was already a fact last year, not just recently. There is a historical reason for this. Originally, the deposits absorbed by various banks in Tianjin were very large, but due to the unstable situation in North China and the wider outlets for funds in the south, most of them were transported to Shanghai for use. After the July 7th Incident, the banknotes of the National Bank were continuously transported to the south. It was impossible to transport them back after the war, so when there was a shortage of chips in the market, they had to accept counterfeit currency to solve the urgent need. In October last year, the pseudo-government once threatened the banks in Tianjin, saying that it would abolish the restriction stipulated by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government that only 5% of deposits could be withdrawn per week. This was probably also a factor that prompted various banks to be involved with counterfeit currency. Now the deposits of various banks in North China have increased compared to before, and they have a slightly better way to deal with debts than before.

Yao Qingsan:

I remember that it was Pan Yugui, the "Mayor" of Tianjin, who threatened the banks, not the Provisional Government itself. But now the intellectual level of the people in North China is much higher, so his threat did not have much effect. Later, the Tianjin Bankers' Association and Pan Yugui negotiated and still maintained the original regulations restricting withdrawals, but appropriately increased the maximum withdrawal amount per week from 150 yuan to 300 yuan.

No Impact on Shanghai Yao Qingsan:

Since North China implemented foreign exchange control, Shanghai has been significantly affected. Sixty percent of North China's export foreign exchange is now taken by the United Reserve Bank. Only the remaining 40% can be freely sold; therefore, the foreign exchange required for North China's imports and the foreign exchange that can be supplied in North China's free market must have a large difference. This insufficient amount will inevitably come to Shanghai to purchase. In other words, legal tender, in addition to supplying the foreign exchange needs of Central and South China, also has to bear part of the foreign exchange needs of North China. Recently, the funds remitted from Tianjin to Shanghai have been very congested, and this situation is very serious. It is said that in order to remedy this situation, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China in Tianjin, in addition to increasing the Shanghai exchange rate, have also limited the amount of remittances per person per day. Currently, the Shanghai exchange rate is probably 60 yuan per thousand yuan, and this exchange rate may still increase.

Li Quanshi:

This phenomenon also illustrates the depreciation of United Reserve Bank banknotes. But the Japanese, who value practical benefits, will not mind. Furthermore, as long as United Reserve Bank banknotes are converted into foreign exchange, it is not necessary to promote them to the south.

Wu Chengxi:

Regarding the issue of counterfeit currency colluding with the Shanghai exchange rate, I would like to add one point. United Reserve Bank banknotes do not need to come to Central China, they are already here in effect. This has two disadvantages for Shanghai. First, it puts pressure on the issuance of national bank notes in Shanghai, and Shanghai's hot money is already very abundant. Now, adding more remittance funds will further increase the difficulty of using hot money and promote speculation. Second, after the remittance funds come to the south, the foreign exchange market will of course be greatly affected. Even if we allow the exchange rate to rise naturally and gradually reduce the amount of Shanghai exchange, we will have suffered a great loss by then. Therefore, I feel that the recent restriction on the amount of remittances and the increase in the exchange rate by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Tianjin is indeed a crucial move.

Wang Zongpei:

The result of foreign exchange control has intensified speculation in the Shanghai market. For the past year, speculators in Shanghai have been constantly stirring up trouble in various aspects such as foreign exchange, foreign currency, shark fin, public debt, foreign merchant stocks, cotton yarn, etc., raising prices at one moment and lowering them at another. Unlucky retail investors often run into walls everywhere. Therefore, there are indeed many people who make "national disaster money," but there are also many outsiders who suffer losses!

Zhu Erjia:

From what I have seen during my travels to the provinces of Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, the value of legal tender foreign exchange is much higher in the interior than in Shanghai, and there are various enterprises such as agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce that can be developed everywhere. Therefore, regarding the problem of abundant hot money and difficulties in using funds in various banks in Shanghai, I believe that as long as the banks can lower the exchange rate between Shanghai and the interior, and further contract the Shanghai market, then on the one hand, it can enable funds to move inward and reduce the difficulty in using them, and on the other hand, it can curb fluctuations in the foreign exchange black market and other speculative markets.

Wei Youpei:

When the loan was established, after the news spread, many people who had previously purchased foreign exchange sold their foreign exchange, even Japanese banks did so. Although it was absorbed by some banks, the market price continued to rise. Therefore, after the establishment of the foreign exchange fund, the growth of the foreign exchange black market, I believe, is not because the foreign exchange fund itself is playing a role, but because under the agitation of this kind of atmosphere, the people's hearts in the foreign exchange market have become more firm.

Sun Liyu:

When Japan declared that it would ban the use of legal tender in North China after March 10th, a small number of people were afraid that there would be problems with legal tender in North China, and they all purchased foreign exchange in the black market, so the black market was under considerable pressure. However, just at this time, the British government announced the establishment of the Sino-British Foreign Exchange Fund in parliament. Everyone knew that the foundation of legal tender was solid, and there was a large amount of foreign exchange being sold off, so the black market exchange rate rose to eight and a half pence. The people of North China knew that legal tender would definitely not be a problem, and a large amount of it was hoarded, so the foreign exchange market relaxed a lot. The Japanese authorities originally thought that banning the circulation of legal tender could threaten the people to exchange legal tender for "United Reserve Bank banknotes" and obtain more foreign exchange, but this trick has now failed again.

Dare Not Go to "Central China"

Yao Qingsan:

Not only that, but Japan does not want to destroy legal tender in Shanghai for a temporary economic reason. Because it can take the legal tender it has plundered in North China to Shanghai to purchase foreign exchange. If legal tender in Shanghai is worthless, it will suffer even greater losses.

Shi Yiweng:

The Japanese and puppet authorities in North China are now conducting door-to-door searches in areas under their control and confiscating any legal tender they find. This kind of behavior not only does not harm the circulation of legal tender, but also strengthens the people's trust in it. From the perspective of the Japanese and puppet authorities, they have gained nothing economically, and their political losses cannot be bought back at any price. Because the general public will leave a deeper impression from this, knowing which path people who have lost the protection of their own country should take.

As for Central China, even the Japanese themselves advocate that legal tender should continue to exist; at least they believe that it cannot be destroyed for the time being. For example, Yoshida Seiji, the president of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, believes that it is absolutely impossible to be hasty in his view of legal tender. Moreover, recently, general business groups in Japan, such as chambers of commerce in Tokyo and Osaka, have advocated separating Central China from the so-called "Yen Group" and still using legal tender as the currency for trade in Central China. If Central China is forcibly included in the "Yen Group," then Japan's exports to Central China must be restricted; the market in the Central China area will inevitably be completely taken over by third countries. Therefore, Japanese merchants in Japan and Japanese residents in Shanghai advocate using legal tender and do not agree with overthrowing it. This view currently occupies a dominant position in Japan; and the Japanese government has already implemented their opinions. For example, the recent relaxation of export restrictions on Central China, allowing legal tender to settle the price of goods, and the trade control of the Japanese and puppet authorities in North China, treating Central China as a third country, are all obvious examples.

Wei Youpei:

The Japanese not only have no way to deal with legal tender, but also have no way to maintain the Japanese yen. No matter how strict they control capital domestically, there is still a lot of capital escaping. It is said that a certain building in Hongkou was recently bought by a Japanese merchant for a price of more than 5 million. The Japanese authorities came out and scolded them for why they did not take so much precious money back to the country to use, but instead bought such a large amount of real estate. If this rumor is reliable, it is enough to illustrate the general public's escape of funds in Japan.

Shi Yiweng:

Recently, Tsuchiya Keishiro, a famous Japanese expert on China, has also proposed a so-called "trade currency" plan to destroy legal tender in Central China. In the summer of last year, Mr. Tsuchiya had proposed a "restoring silver standard" plan to completely overthrow legal tender, but it was shelved because it could not be implemented. But this time, he advocates temporarily retaining legal tender in Central China, only suggesting that the Nanjing puppet government organize a bank, which would issue paper money that can freely purchase foreign exchange with full cash reserves. This kind of paper money is called "trade currency" and is used as a means of trade settlement (such as taels before the abolition of taels and the reform of the yuan, and the Hong Kong dollars used in trade in Guangdong). After its credit is established, it will gradually be promoted to the entire country to replace the position of legal tender. This plan is obviously a castle in the air and will certainly not be implemented. However, due to Mr. Tsuchiya's inconsistency, it can also be seen that Japan's conspiracy is only in vain, and at the same time, it is a counter-proof of China's strong national power and the consolidation of the foundation of legal tender.

Truth About Controlling Trade

Yao Qingsan:

This time, North China's control of exports is not as strict as expected. Only twelve categories of goods are subject to control this time. According to the statistics of 1937, the export amount of these goods was 88 million, and the re-export amount was 66 million, totaling 154 million, accounting for 40% of the total export and re-export of North China. But in reality, in addition to these twelve types, cotton, wool, leather, etc. were already under control last year. The export amount of these types was 71 million, and the re-export amount was 13 million, totaling 84 million. Combining the above-mentioned twelve types, the total is about 240 million, accounting for more than 60% of the total export and re-export of various customs offices in North China. Their control method is this: if exporters want to transport and export the twelve categories of goods under control, they must first sell the foreign exchange they can receive to the exchange bank at the official price of one shilling and two pence, and then the exchange bank will resell it to the United Reserve Bank. The exchange bank can also replenish its stock from the United Reserve Bank, and the amount of import foreign exchange it sells is limited to the amount of export bills it sells to the latter. Also, the control of exports is specified in great detail in terms of items, while the control of imports only makes regulations in principle. However, in the future implementation, I think merchants will definitely not get much freedom.

Sun Liyu:

The control of imported goods is actually also very strict. Although the announcement issued by the "China United Reserve Bank" does not specify the types of goods, importers have the obligation to submit reports when requesting foreign exchange allocation. The "United Reserve Bank" authorities examine the nature of the goods and then allocate foreign exchange, so they have a lot of room for selecting goods. Recently, the "United Reserve Bank" notified various foreign exchange banks, stipulating that more than forty types of goods such as agricultural implements and machinery have priority import rights, which can also prove that the so-called "United Reserve Bank" authorities have the intention to control imported goods. Although they stated in the announcement that various foreign exchange banks can sell foreign exchange within the scope of the amount of foreign exchange they have purchased, according to their intention to control foreign exchange - that is, to increase the foreign exchange reserves of the "United Reserve Bank" - the "United Reserve Bank" will definitely not sell all the foreign exchange it receives. Therefore, we can predict that the import of goods, except for Japanese goods, will definitely be greatly reduced.

Yao Qingsan:

In the announcement of the Tianjin Customs, there are no regulations on the items of imported goods; even in the announcement of the United Reserve Bank, only random regulations are made for imported goods. But no matter what, even if the restrictions are not very strict in writing, in practice, they will still give people all kinds of obstacles in the future.

Example of Failure of Industrial Control

Zhang Yifan:

He wants to seize foreign exchange from the control of trade, which will inevitably make the local commerce and production more and more pressured. The use of political power in the economy requires the support of public opinion to obtain political power. The situation in North China is completely the opposite, so the stricter the control, the smaller the hope of success.

Wang Yutong:

I believe that the opposition between "United Reserve Bank banknotes" and legal tender has both economic and political effects in nature. However, it seems to focus on economics at first. They hope that by relying on the circulation of "United Reserve Bank banknotes," they can expel legal tender from the labor force scope of their occupied areas. Therefore, the first step in promoting the circulation of "United Reserve Bank banknotes" is to start from controlling the goods produced in North China, such as cotton, coal, iron, agricultural products, etc., which are all under control. It is said that at first, Japan's control of cotton and coal in North China was extremely strict; but the results were all failures. As far as coal mines are concerned, up to now, within its occupied areas, only the coal mines along the railway lines can produce coal. Other places are beyond its power. Like various places in Shanxi, due to the guerrilla warfare after clearing the fields and the lack of local labor, production has stopped. As for the cotton-producing areas, most of them are within the control of the guerrillas. It is heard that the cotton production in each area is limited to the amount needed to supply the local needs, and no excess cotton is allowed to be planted. Private transportation is also prohibited. Due to the above reasons, the Japanese side has issued an order to lift the control of cotton in North China and restore free trade. The Japanese side, in view of the failure of economic methods, will inevitably use more political methods in the future, which can be predicted.

Wang Zongpei:

Regarding the cotton control in North China, it was initially only restricted from export in the treaty ports. In the interior, Chinese merchants could still transport it freely. At that time, although the cotton production in the guerrilla areas of North China was strictly blocked by the guerrillas, the smuggling and transportation of merchants still existed. Later, the Japanese strengthened the control along the railway lines and prohibited Chinese people from transporting cotton. If found, they would all be confiscated. As a result, the smuggling merchants stopped doing it, and the source of cotton disappeared. The Japanese had no cotton to collect at all, and had no choice but to stop the control measures in the interior.

End of Meeting

Zhang Yifan:

The more "legal tender countermeasures" Japan plans, the more it proves that he has no way to destroy legal tender. Today, thanks to all of you, the attitude of Japan towards legal tender, the conspiracy to destroy legal tender, the environment in which legal tender is located, and its own foundation, as well as the changes in North China, and the impact on Jiangnan and the Shanghai Valley, have been deeply and clearly analyzed and prospected. This publication is very grateful. I am even more sorry that this symposium has consumed your business time and delayed your work. On behalf of this newspaper, thank you.

### Securities: A Week of Stock Market Review: Jardine Matheson Shares Trade Briskly

During the past week, trading in various stocks on the exchange was initially cautious due to tensions in Europe, resulting in a sharp decline in trading volume. However, by the weekend, the signing of a commercial agreement between Germany and Italy temporarily eased the European situation, and market sentiment revived.

Jardine Matheson was the most actively traded stock during the week, reaching around 100,000 shares. On Monday morning, the price fell to $17.80. On Wednesday, the initial price was $18.70. At 11:30 AM, news broke that the board of directors had decided to distribute a final dividend of $2.75, which was higher than expected, boosting investor confidence and causing the price to surge to $19.50. There was no trading in the afternoon, but the curb market price had already reached $20.00. On Thursday, there was potential for further gains, but Germany's reoccupation of Memel raised concerns about further disputes, causing New York securities to fluctuate by a significant four pounds sterling. Market sentiment weakened, and the price struggled to rise, hovering around $19.50. The same was true on Friday morning. However, in the afternoon, foreign news reported that Germany and Italy had concluded a commercial agreement, and that Britain and France had abandoned the collective security plan, indicating that the European situation had temporarily stabilized. As a result, investors rushed to buy Jardine Matheson shares, causing the price to jump by half a dollar to $20.00. On Saturday, the price continued to rise, reaching a peak of $20.50. However, many investors sold to realize profits, causing the price to drop by 20-30 cents, with the closing selling price at $20.20 and the buying price one dime lower.

Shanghai Silver Company also saw significant trading volume, reaching 10,000 shares on the weekend alone, with prices ranging from $5.75 to $6.15. Kiangnan Dock & Engineering Works also saw active trading, with the price rising to $7.00. Public Bus fluctuated between $23.75 and $24.25. Wheelock Marden initially fell to $33.00 but rebounded to $39.50 on the weekend, with sellers willing to sell at this price but buyers offering $35.00.

Six months ago, 100 shares of Chongsin Cotton Mill were traded at $29.75. At the end of last week, 100 shares were offered at $42.00, a significant increase.

Various bonds saw some activity, but price fluctuations were limited, and trading volumes were low. Rubber shares remained sluggish, with only Chan Shih Ying Trading actively traded. 20,000 shares of Lao Fo were traded during the week at $1.26. The total trading volume on the exchange from March 17 to March 23 is listed on the left: Ordinary shares $2,452,600, Rubber shares $89,200, Bonds $225,000, Total $2,766,800.

The Chinese stocks traded on the Chinese Merchants Securities Market last week included over 100 shares of Chinese Merchants Securities, with the price rising from $28.00 to $28.35. Shanghai Cloth Exchange shares traded at $38.00, a few cents higher than last week. Chinese Electric traded at $5.40 on Monday and $5.425 at the weekend. In addition, 30 shares of Zhejiang Industrial Bank were traded at $65.50.

### Grains: Limited Supply of Du Rice, Rumors of "County Government" Sealing Borders in Changshu and Wuxi

Yesterday, the total supply from various sources to Hexia No. 16 was only 1-2 thousand packages of steamed buns. It is rumored that the pseudo "county government" of Changshu and Wuxi posted a notice in the local rice market the day before yesterday, implementing border closures, resulting in a very limited daily supply. This situation has a real impact on the food supply in Shanghai. It is unknown whether there will be any remedies. Market sentiment was initially subdued in the early morning, but rebounded after hearing the news. As hoarders increased their purchases, the market became active, leading to a tightening of market conditions, presenting a pattern of initial weakness followed by resilience. The prices of Northern Japonica and Bo Da Hexia rice, which were slightly reduced the day before yesterday, all returned to their previous levels. Supplies from Suzhou and Tongxiang remained stable. Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian followed suit, increasing by several cents. The supply and demand were similar, with no significant differences.

### Sugar Market: Stable Sugar Market

The sugar market trend remained stable yesterday. The association's clearing price for 24 coarse white foreign wharf was $24.65, local wharf $24.45, transit goods $16.55, Dutch red $16.60, transit goods $11.00, local wharf No. 1 white $24.50, local wharf No. 1 ice $31.50, No. 2, 3, 4 local white $24.20, Tai B Dong Wharf $24.525, West Wharf $14.65, Tai H red $16.60, Tai XA $20.60, Big Golden Coin was up 30 cents from the previous market, but was not offered. Dutch coarse product was priced at $5.20. Domestic sugar was offered at a normal high-branch red of 200 units, priced at $15.20 to $14.60, down 30 to 40 cents from the previous market.

### Northern and Southern Goods Affected by Yongou, Hunan Lotus Suddenly Rises

Hunan Lotus is suddenly rising due to a certain party invading Zhenhai and Wenzhou being bombed, hindering supplies. The market price yesterday was Hunan Xiangtan Lotus $110, Local Lake Lotus $100, Jiuxi Lotus $95. Local shops and inland sources were all purchasing, and the market appeared very strong.

### Seafood: New Jiangxi Mushrooms Already on Sale

The first batch of new Jiangxi fragrant mushrooms, 20 pieces, have arrived and are already on sale. The price is $238.90 for general goods and $268 for thick mushrooms.

### Wenzhou Dried Shrimp Steadies Upward

The sales of Wenzhou dried shrimp have remained active recently, so the market price has been steadily rising. For example, yesterday's price was $62, which is 50 cents higher than before.

### Medicinal Materials: The Season for Sea Agastache is Approaching, Suddenly Rises by Ten Dollars

The previous market price for Sea Agastache was $20 per dan, with 30-40 pieces offered. Recently, with the summer season approaching and sales expanding, the price has suddenly risen. The day before yesterday, it was already selling for $30. This product is produced in Qiongya, which has been occupied, resulting in a break in supply. Furthermore, the inventory here is also scarce, so there is potential for continued price increases.

### The Production Price of Star Anise is Increasing

The arrival and sales of star anise are balanced. The current market price is $105 per dan (bank transfer). However, according to a Hong Kong telegram yesterday, the production price has already reached (HKD) $41.50, compared to over $39 in the previous market, a real increase of $2.

### Metals: Thin Tinplate, Factory Demand Gradually Moving

The long-silent thin tinplate has seen factories starting to purchase in recent days, but sales to customer shops remain sluggish, so trading is rare. It is reported that only 20-30 dan were offered in the past two days. The market price for 35-pound American goods is $125, British goods are selling for $120, 50-pound goods are selling for $75, and 60-pound goods are priced at $65 (all American goods). Other goods, such as Wild Chicken brand goods are selling for $105, and Juehao is priced at $85, both up one or two dollars from before. Furthermore, because there are no new arrivals, the market is quite active. And because the market's inventory is thin, market sentiment is optimistic.

Coastal Defenses Increasingly Enhanced

According to a gentleman who arrived in Shanghai from Jinhua yesterday morning, the coastal defenses of eastern Zhejiang are under the command of General Commander Liu of the ×th Army Group and Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province. Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou are the responsibility of their respective garrison commanders. The implementation of traffic control, ship inspections, and anti-espionage work is extremely strict. All important ports have defensive fortifications and some underwater installations. The defenses are generally considered solid. Therefore, although Japanese warships have repeatedly harassed the area in the past month, their attempts have been unsuccessful. Now, the Military Commission, due to the tense situation, is strengthening the defenses. In addition to deploying five divisions of elite Central Army troops, Deputy Director of the Political Department Zhou Enlai has been sent to eastern Zhejiang to consult with Chairman Huang, Commander Liu, and others on all matters, and the decided measures will be implemented immediately. Therefore, the defenses of eastern Zhejiang are increasingly enhanced. If the Japanese invade, they will be met with a fierce counterattack.

All Japanese Troops Attempting to Land Eliminated

Japanese troops, attempting to gain access to eastern Zhejiang, have been shelling and harassing the coastal areas of Zhenhai, Haimen, Dinghai, and Xiangshan from time to time. However, due to the strict defenses of the Chinese army, they have not succeeded. Starting on the 19th of this month, they turned to attack the Fuchun River, landing stealthily on Wenjia Weir, Dongsha Island. The garrison troops bravely engaged in a fierce battle. After the arrival of five divisions of Chinese reinforcements, they began to encircle and attack. According to a telegram received yesterday from relevant sources, the landed Japanese troops have been completely eliminated. Currently, both sides are facing each other across the Qiantang River.

Authorities Launch Major Crackdown on Traitors

According to sources in the shipping industry, after the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang, the authorities began a major crackdown on lurking bandits in Yin County, Wenzhou, Haimen, and other places on the 23rd to clear out traitors in the rear. They have uncovered three Japanese-established spy organizations in eastern Zhejiang, and over seventy people involved in conspiracies to respond to the riots have been arrested and are being interrogated by the Tenth Army Group's legal department, where they will be severely punished. Most of these rioters are Zhejiang pirates, plotting to disrupt the rear, and their leader is Korean. They have a large number of firearms supplied by the Japanese. The crackdown is continuing in various parts of eastern Zhejiang.

Wenzhou and Ningbo Peaceful, Shipping Continues as Usual

The American company China America's Tang Sai Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo at 7:00 AM yesterday. According to the ship's crew, the situation in Ningbo has been as peaceful as ever for several days, and the people are particularly calm. There are no Japanese warships anchored outside Zhenhai Port. The situation in Wenzhou and Taizhou is also normal. As for the reports in Shanghai newspapers that coastal residents were being evacuated, the Ningbo authorities have denied it. Therefore, the Oujiang and Yongjiang ports are currently unobstructed, and foreign ships are operating as usual. The German merchant ship Hanna departed directly from Shanghai to Ningbo at 4:00 PM on the 25th. The company has received a telegram from the ship, confirming that it safely entered the port around 9:00 AM on the 26th. The old Taiping Wheel, which was supposed to be blockading Zhenhai Port, is still parked in its original location and has not moved. It can be seen that the authorities do not consider it necessary to completely blockade Zhenhai Port. Vigilance at all ports has not been relaxed, and inspections of passengers and cargo are thorough. Unless there is a new development in the situation, shipping between Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Wenzhou will not be interrupted.

### Urge Rapid Closure of Breaches in the Upper Yellow River; Representatives from Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui Issue Telegram Request; Hope Charitable Organizations Will Provide Assistance as Soon as Possible

Zhang Tao and others, representatives of the Yellow River flood closure petitioners from Henan, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu and Anhui, issued a telegraph requesting funds from various charitable groups to rapidly close the breaches in the upper Yellow River: To the Shanghai Shenbao, transferring to the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, the British Famine Relief in China Committee, the International Relief Committee, and various Chinese and foreign charitable organizations, the Yellow River flood disaster last autumn affected several provinces, causing widespread devastation, and immense loss of life and property. The calamity inflicted on all living beings leaves us weeping without tears. With the war still raging, all breaches in the riverbank have not yet been closed, fertile land remains submerged, and houses are flooded. Millions of orphans and widows have no home to return to, dying of hunger and cold, with no chance of survival. Faced with the imminent threat of bullets, it is as if we are in hell. The old and weak are dying, the young and strong are displaced, and the wails of women and children sadden even heaven and the gods. We and others, surviving from the brink of death, are ashamed to still be breathing. Thinking of this, our hearts are breaking. Looking back at our homeland, we weep tears of blood. Fortunately, we have repeatedly received the benevolent kindness of Chinese and foreign people, generously extending a helping hand to those in distress, and providing a compassionate rescue. With gratitude, we are deeply moved, and although the disaster is severe and funds are scarce, the ability to extend our lives by even one day is akin to recreating and nurturing us. We have heard that benevolence knows no bounds, and this kindness and virtue will be unforgettable for generations to come. Now, we respectfully represent the millions of dying victims in Henan, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu and Anhui, kneeling and weeping to beg all the great benefactors of China and foreign countries to rapidly close the breaches in the upper Yellow River, so that the water in the lower reaches will have a route to discharge, allowing the sea to be restored to land, and emerging from fire and water to find refuge. We have heard that international and British organizations are deeply concerned about the disaster areas in China, and are eagerly donating funds. However, the closure of the Yellow River breaches is hindered by its proximity to the war zone, causing some concerns. We believe that compassion knows no boundaries, and all sentient beings share compassion. We implore the philanthropists of the international charitable organizations, taking a third-party stance, and with the benevolence and courage of God, to consult with military and diplomatic experts. If they could designate the breach closure and construction areas as outside the war zone, the displaced people would be able to return home and work diligently, without the need for supervision, quickly restoring their former livelihoods. Chinese agricultural production is the source of raw materials for the world's industrial and commercial nations. The principle of mutual assistance in life is closely related. Taking advantage of this spring famine, work can be used to replace relief, achieving twice the result with half the effort. If delayed until the arrival of the flood season, there will be no salvation, and even if the great Yu were reborn, he would be helpless. Rescuing people from life and death is critical at this moment, for a moment's delay will bring eternal regret. We implore you, benefactors, to have great compassion and provide assistance as soon as possible, turning negative relief funds into positive results, and utilizing resources to improve people's lives. The millions of survivors in our disaster areas, generation after generation, will forever be grateful for the merits and virtues of your organization. God have mercy, our distress is urgent. We, representatives of the Yellow River flood closure petitioners from Henan, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu and Anhui, Zhang Tao, Dong Baoqian, Jiang Wei, Chang Hengfang, Lü Yin Nan, Sha Yi, Sheng Zhi Ren, Dong Yunsheng, Shangguan Yongming, Zhang Zhen, Tian Xinshan, Xie Yuhua, Hu Fuhua, Hu Peiru, Xu Yangwo, Chen Yinnan, Xing Yaopu, Wang Tongchou, Mei Shaochun, kowtow and weep.

### Artificial Silk Exported to Siam to be Prohibited

The artificial silk industry in various countries has developed rapidly in recent years, with most of its sales going to China and Siam. Therefore, the Chinese silk industry has been greatly affected, with a situation that is difficult to reverse. According to sources in the silk industry, the Siamese government plans to implement a ban on the import of artificial silk from various countries in the near future. The purpose is to protect the domestic silk weaving industry, and it is also due to Article 12 of the new treaty completed with various countries, which clearly stipulates that the Siamese government has the right to promulgate new regulations prohibiting the import of all fake (artificial) products manufactured by science. After the implementation of this regulation, the sales of Japanese artificial silk in Siam will be most severely affected, as Japan accounts for the largest share of artificial silk exports to Siam.

### Japanese Side Actually Regards the North Bank of Suzhou Creek as an Area Under Military Occupation; Says It Does Not Exceed the Scope of International Law; Employing Puppet Police is a Matter Within its Authority

The North China Daily News reported that when the Japanese spokesman received reporters yesterday (25th), he said that the Japanese side considers the entire area north of Suzhou Creek to be an area under military occupation. When asked if this attitude of the Japanese side is based on international law, the spokesman replied that the Japanese military's military occupation of some parts of the public concession does not exceed the scope of international law. Regarding the recent implementation of traffic regulations on the north bank of Suzhou Creek, the spokesman said that since the area where these regulations are implemented is within the area occupied by the Japanese military, there is no need to submit them to the Municipal Council for approval. Furthermore, the implementation has greatly improved the traffic situation in some parts of Hongkou and Yangshupu. When asked how the Japanese authorities defend the use of Chinese people wearing "Great Way" uniforms to assist Japanese sentries at the Garden Bridge, the spokesman replied that the Japanese side believes that the implementation of this method is within its authority. In addition, policing rights and patrol rights are also within the authority of the invading troops.

### Japanese Command Headquarters in Hongqiao Attacked: Detailed Information - A Collaboration Between the 4th Security Regiment and the 1st Loyal and Righteous Army

Further details regarding the previously reported attack on the Japanese command headquarters in Hongqiao by the Shanghai West Guerrilla Unit have come to light. According to detailed reports, the attack on Hongqiao, which took place on March 16th of this year, was a collaborative effort between Zhao Lian, a lieutenant colonel under the command of Xu Leisheng, the regimental commander of the 4th Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command, and the 1st Battalion of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army. The operation was commanded by Commander ×. Initially, there was an encounter battle, which then escalated into a siege. Over thirty enemy troops were killed, and our forces suffered over ten casualties. The battle lasted until dawn. However, the claim that enemy aircraft were destroyed has not been confirmed. The regiment plans to reward and commend the officers and soldiers who distinguished themselves in this battle. In addition, the regiment will submit a detailed report to higher authorities, requesting compensation for the fallen officers, soldiers, and martyrs, in order to encourage future actions. As for the so-called guerrilla leader, Hou Junren, after the fall of the Shanghai suburbs, he had been entrusted with establishing the Southeast National Salvation Self-Defense Corps Headquarters, organizing district self-defense corps, and serving alongside Xu Bainian, the current head of the pseudo-Qingpu Finance Bureau, as district corps commanders. However, Hou treated the matter as child's play and disregarded human life. He abused his authority by openly establishing an opium and heroin company, engaging in rampant drug trafficking. Even more abhorrently, he colluded with the enemy, accepting appointments as the township head of the 12th township of the pseudo-Jiading organization and as the commander of the pseudo-Qingxiang (Clearance) Command. This matter was reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Third War Area Headquarters for review. Instructions were issued jointly to immediately disband the unit, execute the leader Hou Junren on the spot, and order Company Commander Zhao Jiayou to lead his troops to carry out the order. The unit was purged of undesirable elements, the best elements were selected and incorporated, and they were placed under the command of Company Commander Zhao. The traitor Hou, upon hearing the news, fled into hiding. A reward is currently being offered for his arrest and prosecution.

### Gan Rice Transported to Zhejiang for Regulation - 200,000 Dan per Month - Effective from April

The Zhejiang Provincial Government has established a Food Management Committee to make every effort to unblock sources, assess prices, and maintain food supplies. It has now reached an agreement with the Jiangxi Provincial Government on measures for transporting Gan rice to Zhejiang for regulation. The original text is as follows: (1) The Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Governments will respectively telegraph the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to allow rice arriving at stations before March 11 to be loaded and transported. The quantities stored at each station and the daily amount transported will be reported separately to the Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Governments. (2) From now on, rice at stations in Jiangxi that is not handled by the Wartime Trade Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Industrial and Commercial Management Office will be prohibited from being transported. (3) Under the current circumstances (such as when Jiangxi Province needs to purchase a large amount of military rice, both sides may negotiate a different amount), Jiangxi Province will transport 100,000 bags per month, each bag containing 200 "shi jin" (approximately 264 pounds), which is 200,000 "dan," to Zhejiang starting from April. (4) The price of rice transported to Zhejiang by the Jiangxi Wartime Trade Department should be the local market price in Zhejiang, including all transportation costs, with no additional charges. In consideration of the interests of Zhejiang rice merchants, a discount may be given. However, this does not apply when the price of Jiangxi rice, plus all expenses, is higher than the price of Zhejiang rice. In addition, the Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Governments agreed on the transportation of Gan rice to Zhejiang, initially at 80,000 bags per month, i.e., 160,000 "dan," and then changed to 100,000 bags per month, i.e., 200,000 "dan," for a period of five months. The contract was signed on the 21st of this month.

### Japanese Troops Reinforcing Hangzhou - Attacked on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Line - Over 200 Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded - Japanese Troops Conduct Large-Scale Searches in the Suburbs

At around 9:00 AM on the 24th, 2,000 Japanese soldiers boarded trains from Hongkou to the North Railway Station to reinforce Hangzhou. When the train reached the border between Shanghai County and Songjiang on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, it was ambushed by Chinese guerrilla forces. The train's locomotive was immediately destroyed, and machine-gun fire and grenades were unleashed. The Japanese soldiers on board were thrown into chaos and jumped off to resist. The guerrillas immediately retreated and disappeared without a trace. An inspection revealed that a total of over 200 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. Apart from the remaining troops continuing towards Hangzhou, the Japanese troops cleaned up the battlefield the day before yesterday (the 25th), loaded the bodies onto covered trucks, and transported them to Hongkou for cremation. The wounded were sent to hospitals in Nanshi and Hongkou for treatment. Therefore, the Japanese forces have been conducting large-scale searches in the suburbs since the day before yesterday, causing extreme panic.

Japanese Troops Driven Out of Mishidu

Over a hundred Japanese troops from the Yamano Unit stationed in Mishidu were attacked by the Gong Unit of the guerrilla forces the night before last (the 24th). The two sides engaged in fierce combat. The Japanese troops, unable to withstand the attack, were forced to retreat. Mishidu was then recaptured by the Ding Unit. The villagers who had been ravaged by the Japanese troops once again saw the light of day.

Pseudo-Police in Nanhui Stage a Mutiny

The Japanese troops began a "general offensive" against the guerrilla forces in the Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties. Due to the limited number of troops, a unit of puppet troops was mobilized as reinforcements. Some time ago, the Japanese ordered the police from the puppet "Police Bureau" in Nanhui to engage in combat. The leaders of the "puppet police" pretended to agree, and when the unit was transferred to the suburbs, they suddenly staged a mutiny last night (the 25th), killing four Japanese soldiers who were monitoring them. All sixty-odd members of the unit defected to the guerrilla forces and were placed under the command of a unit to attack the Japanese troops.

### Additional Docks to Be Constructed at the Sichuan Road Bridge - Decision Made by the Works Committee - Approved by the Board of Directors

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the docks in Nanshi and Guangfu Road have been closed, making it very inconvenient for ships traveling to and from the interior. To address this, the Public Works Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement has decided to extend the docks westwards along Suzhou Road from the Zhapu Road Bridge. Additional docks will also be built in the Chinese Park at the base of the Sichuan Road Bridge to facilitate berthing. This matter has now been approved by the board of directors and can be implemented immediately.

### Obvious Markings Should Be Used When Promoting Goods - Factory Names, Trademarks, and Brands Should Be Clear to Avoid Suspicion

The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry Association yesterday announced to its members that they must carefully identify whether goods are domestic products when promoting goods, so as to avoid being detained along the way during inspections. At this time of resistance against Japan, goods from certain countries are being boycotted. Recently, there have been reports of goods being detained in various places. Although the goods may not be from a certain country, they lack clear markings, making it difficult to identify them and leading to them being suspected and detained. To avoid similar incidents from happening to members, the association hereby requests all stores to pay attention to the following when adding goods in the future: do not send goods that do not have factory names and goods whose trademarks and brands are blurred and incomplete, making them unidentifiable, in order to avoid misunderstandings and disputes during inspections along the way.

### Bus Stop at the Nissho Building Discussed for Dispersal - Request to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association for Consultation - To Facilitate Traffic and Ensure Safety

The 15th, 18th, 27th, 31st, 32nd, 34th, 35th, 36th, and 37th district branches of the Shanghai Special District No. 1 Citizens' Federation jointly sent a letter to the General Association, requesting that the bus and tram stops in the Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road area be dispersed due to their excessive concentration, which causes pedestrian congestion, obstructs traffic, and provides opportunities for pickpockets. It has been learned that the Citizens' Federation, after learning of the situation, has forwarded a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the Public Concession, requesting them to consult with the Shanghai Municipal Council, the bus company, the tram company, and other relevant authorities to discuss dispersal.

### Concession Authorities Support Limiting Rice Prices - Soy Bean and Rice Market Area Too Small - Announcement of Temporary Suspension of New Members Joining

The Shanghai Soy Bean and Rice Market Management Committee has temporarily suspended new members joining due to the limited area of the market. The concession authorities have expressed their satisfaction with the efforts of the Rice Price Evaluation Committee to stabilize rice prices and maintain food supplies and have pledged their full cooperation. Details are as follows:

Temporary Suspension of New Members Joining

The Shanghai Soy Bean and Rice Market Management Committee has temporarily suspended new members joining due to the limited area of the market.

From today, new members wishing to join the market will be temporarily suspended. The public will be notified when a suitable venue is found to expand the market. A copy of this announcement has been sent to the Soy Bean and Rice Industry Association for their information.

Concession Authorities Express Satisfaction

The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee previously sent letters to the authorities of the two concessions to inform them of the establishment and rice price evaluation. Yesterday, the committee received replies from the French Municipal Council and the Shanghai Municipal Council. (1) The letter from the French Municipal Council stated that they had received letters dated the 8th and 17th of this month and understood that the committee had agreed on rice prices in the city for the convenience of the people. They were pleased to learn that the price limit of 14 yuan per "shi" for the best white rice was set to benefit the public in the current difficult situation. The French Municipal Council would follow the committee's agreement and fully cooperate in every possible way. (2) The letter from the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that they had received the letter dated the 17th of this month and were fully aware of everything, and they had noted the information regarding the organization and address of the Evaluation Committee for record.

Since the Central Government issued a directive to the commanders of various war zones to establish Wartime Party and Government Work Committees to promote wartime Party and government work, various war zones have begun preparations to establish these committees. Some war zones have already announced their establishment. The personnel of these committees consist of representatives from the provincial government and provincial party headquarters, as well as commanders of various war zone commands and detachments. They are responsible for promoting Party affairs and politics in the war zones and establishing Party and government foundations in guerrilla areas, organizing people's organizations, and mobilizing the people. At the same time, they will maintain close contact with Party, government, and military organs at the provincial level to facilitate the advancement of war zone work. They will also carry out various tasks such as providing relief and comfort to displaced people. Therefore, the Central Relief Commission has also sent representatives to participate. This organization is purely to meet the needs of the second phase of the War of Resistance.

### Large Fire at the Nissho Shipping Company Warehouse - Losses Reach 2 Million - Cause of Fire Under Investigation by the Japanese - Japanese Consulate Police Section Moves to the New Asia Hotel

According to the North China Daily News, the warehouse of the Japanese Nissho Shipping Company on Huangpu Road, which caught fire at 11:15 PM on Friday, presented a desolate scene yesterday afternoon (the 25th). Tongues of flame still emerged from the pile of charred rubble, accompanied by thick smoke. Only four scorched walls remained of the massive building, their upper portions tilted precariously. The interior was a chaotic jumble of rubble.

The fire's intensity was evident in the damage to the adjoining shipping office of the Nissho Shipping Company, which served as the headquarters for the Japanese Consulate Police Section. The roof and upper floors were completely destroyed. Several fire trucks continued to spray water into the ruins. Japanese Consul General Miura, Japanese Army Colonel Hirota, Shanghai Municipal Police Department Chief Akagi, along with representatives from the Japanese Navy, the Japanese Consulate, and the police department, gathered at the consulate yesterday to begin investigating the cause of the fire. Japanese sources were widely suspecting

Arson

A Japanese spokesperson told reporters last night that there had been five fires at the warehouse and other properties owned by the Nissho Shipping Company. The most recent fire occurred on December 26, when a factory belonging to the Shanghai Textile Company was destroyed. According to investigations, the fire was caused by arson using chemicals. The spokesperson said that the Japanese authorities believe that Friday night's fire was also an act of arson. The spokesperson added that

Guards

Nine Chinese and Indian guards reported that everything was normal at 6:00 PM on Friday evening, and again at 10:00 PM. However, a few minutes before 11:00 PM, a fire was discovered on the ground floor, which quickly spread and destroyed the entire building. The rooms on the third and fourth floors of the Japanese Consulate Police Section were completely destroyed, and the rooms on the first and second floors were filled with rubble. Therefore, the Police Section has temporarily moved to the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road. Also, according to the China Press,

Preliminary Estimates

The fire at the Japanese Nissho Shipping Company has caused property losses amounting to a staggering 2 million yuan. Although there is no precise calculation yet, the final figure may even exceed 2 million yuan. The property losses include a large warehouse filled with flammable materials, the Japanese Consulate Police Section building, and office buildings of the Japanese Consulate and the Nissho Shipping Company in the same row. The destroyed goods include

A Quantity of Cotton

And other merchandise detained by various merchants. The most recent shipment into the warehouse consisted of 3,000 bales of Indian cotton belonging to the Dongyang Cotton Company, an affiliate of Mitsui & Co., valued at 625,000 yuan alone. Some of the cotton belonged to the Swiss merchant Fojia Foreign Company of this port. It is also reported that the warehouse contained a quantity of cotton cloth, a large amount of timber, and beer. Considering the loss of goods and buildings, the estimate of 2 million yuan seems likely. This fire is the worst

Since the Shift of War

In 1937. Twelve fire trucks and fireboats from the Public Concession arrived at the scene around 11:20 PM on Friday evening and continued to fight the fire until nearly dawn. Japanese authorities met at 3:30 AM yesterday morning to discuss possible causes of the fire, and the meeting lasted for several hours before adjourning at dawn. They met again yesterday at noon to

Resume the Meeting

Detectives from the Hongkou Police Station and the Special Branch of the Police Department headquarters began investigating the possible causes of the fire yesterday morning and are still continuing their investigation. The results have not been disclosed. At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the French Concession Fire Department, acting on orders from French Consul General Baodizhi, also dispatched three fire trucks to the scene. However, the fire was already under control at that time, so they returned.

### Entire Shipping Industry Declining Since January This Year - Japanese Shipping Ranks First in China - Great Attention Paid by British and American Governments to the Shipping Industry in China

After the war, state-owned and private ships were forced to completely cease operations due to the Japanese army's blockade of the coast. Foreign merchants took the opportunity to seize shipping rights. Now, due to Japanese obstruction of navigation and refusal to open the Yangtze River, the shipping industries of Britain, the United States, France, Portugal, and Germany in China have declined, while Japanese ships have risen to the top spot. Details are as follows:

The Entire Shipping Industry Suddenly Declines

In August of the 27th year, imports were 9,631,130 tons, and exports were 9,420,946 tons. In September, imports were 11,026,528 tons, and exports were 10,813,654 tons. In October, imports were 12,251,224 tons, and exports were 12,001,080 tons. In November, imports were 13,516,662 tons, and exports were 13,268,765 tons. In December, imports were 14,812,920 tons, and exports were 14,616,918 tons. In January of the 28th year, imports were 1,238,182 tons, and exports were 1,148,178 tons. In February, imports were 2,405,418 tons, and exports were 2,330,195 tons.

Japan Monopolizes China's Shipping Industry

In the past, foreign shipping to China was dominated by England. Now, due to Japanese obstruction and refusal to open the Yangtze River, the tonnage of British shipping in China has decreased from 1,128,037 tons in August of last year to 713,408 tons in February of this year. Meanwhile, the tonnage of Japanese shipping has increased to 832,149 tons in February of this year, ranking first among all countries shipping to China. The coastal areas of North China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been monopolized by Japanese merchants. In addition to operating the Shanghai-Xiamen route, Japanese companies such as Nisshin Steamship Company are planning to open the Shanghai-Hong Kong route.

British and American Governments Attach Importance

The British and American governments have paid great attention to the Japanese obstruction of foreign ships carrying goods at Hangzhe, Haimen, and Funing in northern Jiangsu. In order to maintain their shipping routes in China, British companies such as Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson have decided not to suspend operations on their existing routes, such as the Shanghai-Qingdao-Yantai-Weihai-Tianjin route, despite the sharp decline in passengers and cargo. They are also making every effort to restore the shipping industry in China and plan to open new routes to avoid being monopolized by Japanese merchants. At the same time, they are building new ships in their home countries to be added to the various shipping routes in China.

Customs Statistics on Merchant Ships Traveling to and from Foreign Countries

Also, the customs released statistics on merchant ships traveling to and from foreign countries in February. Shanghai: 1,189,903 tons; Jiaozhou: 230,379 tons; Shantou: 221,681 tons; Tianjin: 192,684 tons; Xiamen: 119,923 tons; Qinhuangdao: 101,695 tons; Yantai: 64,748 tons; Hainan: 58,474 tons; Leizhou: 44,369 tons; Gongbei: 31,186 tons; Beihai: 22,295 tons; Wenzhou: 16,561 tons; Weihaiwei: 13,824 tons; Kowloon: 12,573 tons.

### Expand the Anti-Spitting Campaign - Increase Publicity - Print Pictures and Slogans to Raise Public Awareness

The Cleanliness and Hygiene Anti-Spitting Campaign, initiated by the Shanghai Women's Movement Federation and the Chinese Education Bureaus of the two concessions, was launched yesterday. In addition to advising the public to promote the prohibition of spitting in public places and on the radio, pictures and slogans have also been printed and posted everywhere to increase publicity, raise public awareness throughout the city, and ensure public health. (1) Spitting everywhere will spread tuberculosis. (2) Exercise more often, bathe regularly, be healthy, and you will spit less. (3) Where do you spit? (4) Spitting everywhere can easily spread disease. (5) Spitting everywhere is a bad habit, we must correct it.

### Songjiang Organizations Initiate a Memorial Service for Shen Lianbi

Shen Lianbi, courtesy name Mingjun, graduated from National Peking University in his early years. He devoted himself to cultural and charitable causes, making significant contributions. He served as a member of the National Economic Council Transportation Committee, secretary of the International Radio Station, director of the Charity Association of the Seven Counties of Songjiang, director of the Songjiang County Education Bureau, principal of Songjiang County Girls' Middle School, and founder of the New Songjiang Society. When Songjiang fell two years ago, Shen moved to Shanghai. Unfortunately, he developed tuberculosis and died at noon on March 16 of this year at the Chinese Red Cross Hospital. Shen's relatives and friends in Shanghai, as well as various organizations in Songjiang, plan to hold a memorial service. The first preparatory meeting was held at Songjiang Middle School, Lane 384, Fuzhou Road on the afternoon of March 25.

### Traffic Safety Campaign: Pedestrian Violations Should Be Fined; The Biggest Difficulty Is Guiding Pedestrians, and Detailed Rules Are Being Drafted

The Continental Daily reports that a major proposal related to the upcoming "Safety First" campaign has been put forward, stating that pedestrians and drivers who disregard traffic lights or cross roads outside designated areas will be fined. It is said that the biggest difficulty is guiding pedestrians, as statistics show that most traffic accidents are not the fault of drivers, but are caused by pedestrians' own carelessness. The arrival in Shanghai of millions of farmers and people from small towns, who are not accustomed to crowded traffic, has made this problem even more difficult. It is now proposed to first launch a large-scale campaign to warn pedestrians to cross crowded roads only within designated lines, to pay attention to traffic regulations even when they have to proceed against a red light, and to strictly abide by traffic regulations. In the past few years, the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council has attempted to guide pedestrians in this way. Yellow lines have been drawn on crowded streets, and notices saying "Cross Here" have been posted. However, due to a lack of publicity, the significance of this method has been reduced and it has been ineffective. It is now proposed that after a large-scale campaign, pedestrians who violate the regulations should be fined. Some also suggest imposing small fines on violators and giving the fines to the patrol officers who catch the violators at the scene. Police officers should also be required to carry receipts. The detailed rules for "Safety First" week are currently being drafted by a nine-person committee.

### Customs Wusong Sub-Station: News of Restoration; Whether Smuggling Can Be Effectively Suppressed Is Still in Doubt

The news that the Jianghai Customs is restoring police powers at Wusong was reported yesterday. According to the Modern News Agency, the Jianghai Customs Wusong sub-station has been in negotiations with the Japanese side through the British Customs Commissioner Mr. [Luo Fu De] for nearly half a year. The issue was not resolved due to repeated excuses from the Japanese side, and the Japanese side repeatedly demanded that when the Jianghai Customs restores the Wusong sub-station, it should increase the number of Japanese ordinary customs officers as a condition. The negotiations on this matter have now come to an end. Mr. [Luo] agreed to increase the number of Japanese ordinary customs officers, and the Wusong sub-station is scheduled to resume operations on the first of next month. However, the Japanese side has not yet agreed to return the original customs sub-station building at Wusong. Therefore, the customs will use ships as mobile offices, with Western customs officers as directors, accompanied by Chinese customs officers and newly added Japanese customs officers. As for whether a large number of smuggled goods entering the Yangtze River line through the Wusong port can be effectively suppressed after the Wusong sub-station is restored, foreigners are observing that it is still in doubt. It is also reported that the original customs Wusong search team will also be restored at the same time, exercising the power to inspect prohibited items and tax-evading goods on incoming and outgoing ships. Chinese, Western, and Japanese customs officers of the entire team will be stationed on the lower level of the [Yasheng] transport ship returned by the Japanese side. Therefore, the customs power in the Wusong area has ostensibly returned to its pre-war normal state.

### Public Concession Police Authorities: Strict Search Operations; No Slackening in the Past Two Weeks, From Temples to Curtains, Uninterrupted Rotation; Armed Patrols by Military Squads

The Public Concession police authorities are strictly carrying out search operations to prevent terrorist incidents. The campaign has been vigorous and has continued for two weeks without any slackening. Armed Chinese and foreign police officers from various police stations are dispatched daily and are quite serious. Vehicle inspections have become busier recently. Armed detectives are stationed at important border areas to search private, taxi, public buses, and trams. During curfew hours, there are many cars traveling back and forth. Cars that are usually not inspected are often stopped for searches of passengers inside. A large number of police officers are dispatched after 5:00 AM, and the patrols continue until late at night. The strictness of the precautions is unprecedented recently. Search operations in the Shanghai West area are even more intense, paying more attention to areas along the Suzhou River, such as the Fujian Road Bridge, Old Garbage Bridge, North Mud City Bridge, the Tenth Road bus stop at the Xinzha Road intersection, the Wuzhen Road, the two bridges of Xinzha, the intersection of Meibai Ge Road and Xinzha Road, the areas in Shanghai West and the areas where roads are built beyond the boundary such as the intersection of Labor Sheng Road, Pinlang Road, Singapore Road, Kangnao Tuo Road, Xinzha Road, Aiwen Yi Road, Yu Garden Road, Jing'an Temple Road on Jiaozhou Road. Western and Indian police officers in groups of three, leading four or five Chinese police officers, take turns guarding these areas all day, checking trams, public buses, taxis, rickshaws, and pedestrians. Inspection teams on the roads and sidewalks are also constantly moving. Red security vehicles are dispatched from time to time to carry out inspections anytime and anywhere. Small squads of soldiers from the garrisons of various countries also carry out armed patrols. During inspections, thirty or forty Chinese, Western, and Indian police officers work in shifts. Western officers and Chinese police officers search vehicles and pedestrians, while Indian police officers carry long guns and stand guard, creating a very strict atmosphere.

### The Case of the Dazhong Funeral Home: Manager Found Not Guilty

The British-owned Dazhong Funeral Home on Changping Road in Shanghai West is a joint-stock company. [Hu Zhenhua], an employee of the Chinese Weixin Office, serves as the Chinese manager. [Zheng Bosheng], a major shareholder of the funeral home, introduced [Qian Weichen] and [Qian Yuansheng] to serve as general affairs staff members for the business. On September 11 of last year, [Wang Hongxiang], a bill collector at the funeral home, embezzled 14.6 yuan when collecting payment from customer [Chen Honglai]. [Hu] discovered this and, believing the opportunity had arrived, colluded with [Wang], instructing [Wang] to say that the embezzled money was split with the two [Qians]. [Hu] then reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, and [Wang] and the two [Qians] were detained and brought to the First Special Court. During the court hearing, [Wang] suddenly had a change of heart and confessed that the false accusations against [Qian Weichen] and [Qian Yuansheng] were instigated by [Hu Zhenhua]. As a result, [Wang] was sentenced to eight months in prison, and the two [Qians] were declared not guilty. However, [Hu] was still unwilling to give up and hired former Municipal Council lawyer [Mei Shuo Lan] to appeal to the Municipal Council Legal Department against the not-guilty verdict for the [Qians]. However, after review by the Second Branch of the High Court, it was also determined that [Wang Hongxiang]'s testimony in the first trial, pointing to [Hu] instigating the false accusations, was true. Therefore, the Municipal Council's appeal was rejected. Before the case was finalized, [Hu] suddenly published advertisements in newspapers, still claiming that the two [Qians] had colluded with [Wang Hongxiang] to embezzle funds and fired them. [Qian Weichen] and [Qian Yuansheng], after reading the newspaper, felt that [Hu] had first falsely accused them of a crime and then published false advertisements defaming their reputations, making it difficult for them to live in society. The depth of his malice was truly unforgivable. Therefore, based on [Wang Hongxiang]'s confession, the Second Branch of the High Court's determination, and the advertisements published by [Hu Zhenhua], they hired lawyers [Fan Gang] and [Yu Enliang] to file a lawsuit against [Hu Zhenhua] and [Wang Hongxiang] in the criminal division of the First Special Court, accusing them of false accusation and defamation, requesting that they be punished according to Articles 169, 309, and 310 of the Criminal Law, and also filed a civil suit, requesting that [Hu Zhenhua] be ordered to publish the verdict in various newspapers for three days each, as well as restore their reputations. Yesterday, Judge [Fu Lin] opened the Second Criminal Court to hear the case. [Hu Zhenhua] hired lawyer [Gu Hanli], and [Wang Hongxiang] hired lawyer [Chen Chengyin] for their defense. First, lawyer [Yu] stated the process and presented evidence, stating that the plaintiffs would not have filed this lawsuit if the defendant had not published advertisements destroying the plaintiffs' reputations and making it difficult for them to gain a foothold in society. It was only because [Hu] repeatedly acted with malicious intent that they had to file this lawsuit. When questioned, both defendants denied having colluded to falsely accuse the plaintiffs, claiming that the plaintiffs' actions were retaliatory. After arguments by both lawyers, the judge ruled in court that both [Hu Zhenhua] and [Wang Hongxiang] were not guilty. It is said that [Qian Weichen] and others were dissatisfied with the verdict and decided to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court.

### Owner of Huahua Milk Factory Kidnapped by Bandits; Japanese Puppets Ignore It

Bandits in the [Yanpu] area of Pudong are rampant, robbing and kidnapping without restraint. [Chen Yinyin], a 50+ year old man from Nanhui, opened the Huahua Milk Factory next to the Changchang [Zhanzhen] on the west side of Pudong Avenue, possessing modest assets. He was coveted by bandits. Around 9:00 PM the night before, more than a dozen men, each wielding weapons, broke into the factory and kidnapped [Chen]. As of last night, he was still in danger. The Japanese puppet authorities are ignoring the kidnappers.

### Illegal Gambling Spreads in the Concession; Public Police Break Up Two Locations, Punish Separately; 41 Gamblers Arrested for Gambling on Pai Gow

Various gambling dens in Shanghai West have sprung up one after another, and the current period is the most prosperous. There are all kinds of gambling activities. After the [Hua Jun Biedong Dui] repeatedly cracked down on major gambling dens and issued warnings, the gamblers were all alarmed. Recently, there has been talk of moving the dens to Hongkou. It is said that this plan is still under consideration by their protectors, and its implementation is pending. However, the protectors will control the gambling dens, and soon all existing large and small gambling dens, as well as flower club headquarters and branches, will be ordered to stop, re-register, and the number of gambling dens will be limited to five. Gamblers, in order to prolong their lives, are competing to curry favor with their "masters." According to speculation, Hollywood, [Rongsheng], [Guangsheng], [Dasheng], and [Daxin] have been pre-selected as the controlled gambling dens after the reorganization. The relocation of the dens will be subject to the approval of the protectors at that time. As for the flower clubs, their situation is very different from other types of gambling and cannot be touched by outsiders. Therefore, those advocating control believe that the flower clubs should still be operated by experienced hands such as [Mao A Xiang], [Yu Ru Seng] (i.e., [Yu Shi Sheng]), and [Li Xiao Bao] under the names of [Yi Ji] Headquarters and [Ji Ji] Branch, without major changes. [Mao], [Yu], and [Li] were especially motivated by this exceptional arrangement, and vigorously recruited the unemployed, luring them with benefits to serve as lookouts. A local youth, who claimed not to be a traitor, was lured by profit to close the secret room inside his bungalow behind No. 1254 Jing'an Temple Road to accommodate men and women who came to gamble on flower clubs. The house, including the shop in front, belonged to the Teng family and was managed by Teng's grandmother, who rented the shop to [Liu Changyu]. [Teng Ying], who used to work in the Finance Bureau of the Municipal Government, has been unemployed since the National Army withdrew westward. Recently, he was lured by [Mao]'s henchmen, allowing him to work for a gold salary per day, and sold himself as a lookout. Detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station investigated and learned of this, and went to arrest him the other day. [Liu] was also present and was arrested as well. 150-160 flower club slips and more than 60 yuan in gambling money were confiscated. On the 25th, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer [Qian Xunjiu] prosecuted them according to law, requesting punishment. Judge Meng questioned [Teng]'s confession that after becoming unemployed, the "Dadao" Municipal Government had summoned him, but he had not gone because he did not want to be a traitor, and that he was now working as a lookout and was not a traitor. [Liu], on the other hand, firmly denied that he had induced people to gamble on flower clubs, saying that he was mistakenly arrested. As a result, [Teng Ying] was sentenced to six months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day of the sentence, and the gambling money and gambling tools were confiscated. [Liu Changyu] was acquitted and released. There was also [Liu Yulin], a native of Tianjin who used to be a smoker and became a lookout because of his addiction to opium, unemployment, and poverty, joined the flower club organization, and served as a lookout. He rented a room from [Mao Afu], a resident of No. 1, Lane 332, Seymour Road, as a place to sell opium and induce gambling. The other day, detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station rushed there and arrested [Liu], his landlord [Mao Afu], his accomplice [Shen Jinquan], and [Wang Alin] and other men and women who had been gambling on flower clubs, a total of seven people. Together with the confiscated evidence, they were sent to the court the other day. After questioning by Judge Meng, [Liu] was sentenced to one year in prison for gambling and eight months in prison for opium offenses, to be served concurrently for a total of one year and two months, with public rights deprived for three years. [Shen] was sentenced to five months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day. [Mao] was sentenced to two months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of one yuan per day. The other several people, including [Wang], were fined 15 yuan each, and the gambling money and gambling tools for opium and gambling were confiscated. In addition, the gambling den at the Mainland Hotel at No. 69 Yuchaqing Road was also verified by detective [Zhou Yushan] of the Chengdu Road Police Station. The other day, he rushed to arrest them with Chinese and Western detectives. As soon as they reached the fourth floor, the hotel waiter [Su Jinyuan] dared to alert them. He was arrested, together with [Gu Liangyu], who was the ringleader of the Pai Gow gambling in Room 〇四, and nineteen other male and female gamblers. Someone else opened a gambling den for Pai Gow at No. 9, Lane 139, Dagu Road. The other day, detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station secretly went there and arrested twenty male and female gamblers, including [Yang Li Shi]. Because the boss had not yet been arrested, the twenty people were each allowed to deposit 30 yuan in the police station as bail. Yesterday morning, the eleven people involved in the above two cases were brought to the First Special Court for separate trials by Judge Meng. The police lawyer stated that the gambling den at the Mainland Hotel had been separately sued in the police court. After questioning each defendant one by one in court, Judge Gu was sentenced to five months in prison and [Su] was sentenced to two months in prison, both of which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. The nineteen people caught in the Mainland Hotel were each fined 50 yuan, and the twenty people, including [Yang Li Shi], were each fined 40 yuan. The gambling tools were confiscated.

### Husband is a Drifter by Nature; Young Woman Sues for Divorce

[Zhang Chai Miaodi], a young woman from Ningbo, 23 years old this year, was married to [Zhang Jintang] on March 26th of the 25th year of the Republic with a matchmaker. Now, [Zhang Rong Miaodi] has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special Court against her husband, [Zhang Jintang], seeking a divorce. It is said that since the marriage, the two parties have not had any children, but the defendant is a drifter by nature and has repeatedly refused to change despite repeated persuasion. Last year, the defendant took advantage of the plaintiff's absence to move all the clothes and furniture in the house. When the plaintiff returned home and discovered this, she could not find them. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to post a notice in the newspaper, but there was no news. The defendant has indeed abandoned the plaintiff maliciously for more than a year. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1052, Paragraph 5 of the Civil Code, she is suing for a divorce. After receiving the complaint, the court summoned the plaintiff's lawyer to the Civil Court 7 on the other day by Judge [Wu Xiaoke]. The defendant did not appear. The court stated that according to what was written on the complaint, the defendant lived at No. 11 [Deshengli], [Baier] Road, and the bailiff was sent to deliver the summons, but no one accepted it. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant actually lived there and requested another summons. The court agreed to reschedule the hearing to the 28th to summon the defendant for questioning.

### Vegetable Vendor Crushed to Death

[Gan Zhenqing], a native of [Yinxianggang], 63 years old this year, moved to No. 27 [Shuziwan], [Xuhong] Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai West, to avoid the war. He made a living by selling vegetables. On the morning of the 13th of this month, [Gan] went out to sell vegetables. When he was walking through the intersection of [Haige] Road, Xujiahui, a garbage truck No. 28 of the French Public Works Department, driven by driver [Zhou Fengyu] (11 years old, from Jiangbei), was coming from east to west and was turning north. [Gan] did not have time to dodge and was knocked to the ground. His left foot was crushed by the rear wheels of the truck. A patrol officer saw this and sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital for treatment. He also reported to the police station. [Gan] died from his injuries on the other day due to his age and the severity of the injuries. The hospital notified the police station, who took the body to the autopsy station. Yesterday, Prosecutor [Wang Ren] of the Second Special Court arrived at the station and confirmed that the deceased died from being crushed by the truck. The deceased's son, [Gan Jinzhou], signed a statement to claim the body. The family requested that the police station negotiate with the defendant to compensate for the losses.

### Rental Disputes in [Wenlan Fang], [Julai Da] Road

The houses in [Wenlan Fang] on [Julai Da] Road in the French Concession are owned by [Wu Wenjing], [Jiang Lansun], etc., and are named "[Wenlan Fang]". There are more than twenty tenants in total. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War two years ago, the population living in these houses suddenly increased, and the cost of tap water also increased significantly. From January 1st of this year, the landlord suddenly stopped supplying tap water to the tenants, asking the tenants to install their own water meters. The tenants discussed how to deal with this, all saying that this measure was equivalent to a disguised rent increase. They repeatedly decided to negotiate with the landlord, but there was no satisfactory resolution. Recently, the landlord has refused to accept the rent paid by the tenants, causing panic among the tenants. Yesterday afternoon, they invited all the tenants to discuss and decided to hire a lawyer to negotiate with the landlord. If the landlord continues to refuse to accept the rent, they will deposit it with the court and seek relief.

Judge Feng ordered that he be detained for investigation. It is said that the defendant still refuses to reveal the source of the counterfeit money.

### Ticket Checker at [Fahua Dongzhen] Theater Killed; [Xu Xiao Er Zi] Dies from Three Gunshots

[Xu Xiao Er Zi] (33 years old), a native of Jiangbei residing at No. 16 [Huixi] Street, [Xujiahui] Town, was a gambler. He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for robbery. Recently, he was released after serving his term and is now working as a ticket checker at the [Tongxing Yangzhou] Theater at the entrance of [Fahua Dongzhen] (i.e., along [Haige] Road). He is also one of the shareholders of the theater, so his life is still not difficult. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, seven or eight men in different outfits were loitering and peeping near the theater. At that time, [Xu] went out of the theater. After walking a few steps, he was caught up by a man wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, who pulled out a pistol and fired at [Xu]. He was shot three times, once in the head and twice in the body, and fell to the ground and died instantly. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, calmly escaped. After the incident, the [Zhengshi] Middle School Japanese Constable Team learned of it and immediately went to inspect the scene and searched the town. The deceased was wearing a suit and black leather shoes, and died at the entrance of the theater. Later, his family was notified to come and claim the body. The deceased left behind a wife and three children, and his wife is still pregnant. According to those familiar with the matter, the cause of the case seems to be a vendetta.

### Internal Conflict Between Fake "Army" and Fake "Police": Japanese Side Protects Fake "Army," Chuan Xiao'an Uses Two-Faced Tactics

After the establishment of the fake "army" in the Shangnan Railway area of Pudong, a recent internal conflict has erupted with the local fake "police bureau" over matters of interest. The Japanese army is protecting the fake "army," causing the turmoil to escalate and spread to the fake "city government." The incident began a week ago when Wang Jia'san, the fake "police chief" of Yangsi Bridge, harbored resentment against the fake "army." At that time, three members of the fake "army" were extorting civilians, and he arrested them. The fake "leader" requested the Japanese army to intercede for their release, but was unsuccessful. He slapped Wang in the face several times. Wang, feeling humiliated, complained to Lu Ying. Lu reported the situation to the fake "city government" and sought help from the Japanese special service agency to punish the offending Japanese officer. However, not only was this goal not achieved, but the local Japanese army instead forced the dismissal of Wang Jia'san, the insulted fake "police chief." Lu and Chuan found themselves in a difficult situation, so they devised a hasty plan to release the three arrested members of the fake "army" as a gesture of appeasement. They also promoted Wang, the fake "chief," to become the fake "branch bureau chief" of Beiqiao, both to show respect for the Japanese army's face and to avoid Wang's suffering. The conflict between the Japanese and the puppets was thus resolved. Wang's vacancy was filled by Cheng Yunkun, a fake police officer from Minhang. Yin Zhongli, the former fake "branch bureau chief" of Beiqiao, was taken by surprise, unfairly replaced, and forced to ask the "bureau" to reassign him, effectively losing his job. It is said that Yin was originally protected by Zhao Guangdi, the former head of the fake "police bureau's inspection department" and head of the fake "public utilities bureau." Zhao has fallen from power, so Yin had no support and was forced to leave his position.

### Anti-Spitting Campaign

— Qin

Tuberculosis germs are tiny things invisible to the naked eye, but tuberculosis is fiercer than a tiger. In our country, more than 300 out of every 100,000 residents die of tuberculosis each year! Taking 450 million people as a calculation, about 1.6 million people die of tuberculosis every year. This is such a terrifying number!

Tuberculosis germs are called tubercle bacilli, and they are often mixed with sputum. Therefore, people with tuberculosis can spread tuberculosis anywhere if they spit indiscriminately.

If we want to prevent the spread of tuberculosis, we must first practice not spitting indiscriminately. Spitting indiscriminately is not only easy to spread diseases, but also unclean and unsightly. This is a very bad habit that must be eradicated!

Now the Shanghai Women's Federation, with the support and cooperation of the two concessions and the Chinese Education Bureau, has launched an anti-spitting campaign and has scheduled an anti-spitting campaign promotion week from March 26 to April 1. During this week, they will go to various schools and public places to give speeches to promote the harm of spitting and the appropriate methods for disposing of sputum. People who like to spit indiscriminately will no longer spit randomly.

The Federation has compiled and printed an anti-spitting teaching material for primary school students to read. I hope that every primary school student in the city will have a copy, so that they can develop the habit of not spitting from an early age, and the public will no longer have the bad habit of spitting indiscriminately.

The Federation has also specially made a "Health is Treasure" badge for people participating in the campaign to wear. This badge has two meanings: first, everyone who wears the badge must swear not to spit indiscriminately in the future; if they have to spit, they must spit in a spittoon or handkerchief. Second, everyone who wears the badge must always advise others not to spit indiscriminately.

### Anti-Spitting Campaign and Tuberculosis Prevention Methods

— Lai Douyan

Foreigners often ridicule our country as the "Sick Man of East Asia," because our physique is far inferior to theirs, especially because there are more people in our country with tuberculosis than in any other country. According to recent statistics, more than 300 out of every 100,000 residents die of tuberculosis each year in our country, while Japan has only 186, France 164, Italy 154, Germany 98, Britain 97, and the United States has the least, only 80.

Calculating based on the national population of 450 million, approximately 1.6 million people die of tuberculosis in our country each year, and there are 30 times more patients than this (i.e., 48 million people). This number is truly alarming. Assuming that the social loss from the death of one person is about 2,000 national currency units, then the loss from tuberculosis deaths in our country each year is at least 320 million national currency units! If this huge sum were used to build primary schools (each primary school costs about 10,000 national currency units), then 320,000 schools could be built each year, benefiting many children.

The economic loss of tuberculosis is as mentioned above, and its pathogen is a bacterium called the tubercle bacillus. This bacterium likes to be mixed with sputum the most. Therefore, if people with tuberculosis have no public morality and spit indiscriminately, the tubercle bacillus can take this opportunity to infect others. A doctor recently checked the sputum on the streets and other public places in Shanghai and found that a quarter of it contained tubercle bacilli. After this bacteria dries, it can fly everywhere and enter the human body, causing illness. What a dangerous thing to think about spitting is.

The most effective way to avoid the dangers of tuberculosis is to promote the "anti-spitting campaign." From a negative point of view, it is best for each of us not to spit, and if we absolutely cannot control ourselves, we should spit the sputum into a spittoon or handkerchief to avoid harming others. From a positive point of view, we must pay attention to daily hygiene, such as exercising more, breathing more fresh air, and taking more baths, so that our bodies can become stronger and sputum will naturally decrease.

Finally, we must think about our responsibility to others. We should not only take care of ourselves, but also persuade others, such as family members, neighbors, and classmates, to make them aware of the harm of spitting and understand the way to maintain health. If all the children do this, what should the country worry about being strong?

Common Sense of Life

### Please Don't Spit!

— Jifeng

Spitting, this thing, in the eyes of us Chinese, is a very small thing. It doesn't require an "anti-spitting campaign." If there is phlegm, just spit it out, and that's it. There is no need to ask where to spit. Fortunately, when you cough, my throat also itches, so I spit it out as well. You spit, I spit, we all spit a few times, and things are considered free and equal, and don't contain unfair effects. So whether you spit on the tram, spit on the road, or even if you don't like spitting, it's completely free. What's the big deal?

However, generally speaking, the gentlemen who talk about hygiene talk about the harm of spitting, and it's so logical that I don't know whether to believe it or not. Now I have excerpted the documents of the anti-spitting campaign below for everyone to study.

Sputum is a low-level mucus in the human lungs, secreted from the mucous membranes of the throat and trachea. When we catch a cold and cough, the sputum follows and is spat out from the mouth. It is something excreted from the body. According to people who understand medicine, people with weak bodies and insufficient resistance often catch colds due to cold and warm imbalances, which causes inflammation in the throat and trachea, and the secretions increase particularly. Therefore, people with colds and coughs have particularly increased sputum. In addition, people who smoke, or people who live in unclean and unventilated houses, also have particularly increased sputum. In short, no matter what kind of sputum, before it is spit out, it can absorb dust and impurities in the air, and make it stick to the cilia and mucus on the nostrils (sputum). And human health, is very good. But after the sputum is spit out, it becomes an excretion, which not only contains dust and impurities, but also contains tubercle bacilli or bacilli due to the weakness of each person's body. This kind of bacteria is easy to adhere with the help of mucus. If the mucus is dried by sunlight, it can float in the wind again and invade people's trachea, thus spreading the disease, which is very dangerous. Many people think that spitting consumes energy, so they do not advocate spitting, but swallow the sputum into their stomachs. Alas! Now that we know that the contents of the sputum are just some dust and mucus, and some are even mixed with bacteria, it is a very unclean and harmful thing, so how can the sputum be swallowed, but since the sputum cannot be swallowed, it should be spat out. Most Chinese people do not pay attention to hygiene and spit indiscriminately, which has become a habit. There is no spittoon in the room, so they spit on the ground. Even if there is a spittoon, they are sometimes too lazy to walk a few steps and spit casually. As for the roads outside, they are even spittoons for everyone, so that there are thick and thin sputum everywhere, which makes people disgusted when they see it. It must be known that spitting indiscriminately is not only unclean and unsightly, but also extremely unhygienic. According to microscopic examination, the bacteria contained in a mouthful of sputum can sometimes be as many as tens of millions, which is really terrible, so spitting is a small matter, but the relationship is very important. In order to deal with spitting, it is best to make people not spit. If there is sputum, it is necessary to spit, then there must be a place to spit. Generally, in the room, if there is a spittoon, it should be spat into the spittoon (it is better to put some disinfectant chemicals such as carbolic acid in the spittoon to kill the bacteria in the sputum). If there is no spittoon, then it must be spat into paper or a towel for burning or washing. If you are walking on the road, of course, it is not suitable to have a spittoon, so you can only spit it into paper, a towel, or a ditch, and never spit it on the road.

However, one thing must be noted, that is, now there are many educated people who know that spitting indiscriminately is unhygienic, so they carry a handkerchief with them. When they have to spit, they take out the handkerchief and spit into it. After spitting, they still put it in their pocket. After a while, when they have to spit again, they take it out again and spit into it. They do not wash it all day or two, so that the sputum that was spat out earlier evaporates through the temperature of the body and dries early. When they take it out again for the next spit, with a shake, the bacteria in the original sputum will detach from the handkerchief and fly into the air, which has the danger of spreading the disease. Therefore, the handkerchief of a spitting person is still unsanitary if it is not washed quickly. Compared to this, it is more reasonable to spit the sputum into paper and burn it in the fire after a while. Otherwise, prepare two handkerchiefs, so that after one spit, you will not take it out again, and if you want to spit again, you can use the second handkerchief. Exchange each other, and then wash them clean, which is also not impossible.

The above said, or the method of dealing with when there is sputum and it is necessary to spit. As for the method of preventing not spitting, it must be considered from the root. We study the causes of sputum, which are generally caused by air and coal smoke, and physical weakness. According to this, we can open more windows in our residences to circulate air, and often sweep to pay attention to cleanliness, then sputum can also be relatively reduced.

In addition, we must also take more baths, smoke less, remove the accumulation of dirt on the body, and make the skin excrete smoothly. On the one hand, we must exercise, and then the causes of sputum can also be relatively reduced. May everyone pay attention to it at all times.

Public Lyrics

### Wen Tianxiang

— Zhang Mengfei

(Wen Tianxiang's aria) The winds and clouds bring illusions, regret is boundless. The Song Dynasty's mountains and rivers are destined to end, but a speck of loyal heart shines like the sun and moon, a lifetime of heroic spirit pierces through the long rainbow.

(Spoken) I, Wen Tianxiang, courtesy name Songrui, am from Jishui, Jiangxi. This time, defending Chaozhou, just because the rebel general Zhang Hongfan's forces are fierce and mighty, I was trapped and captured alive by him. Alas! Having come to this point, I can only sacrifice this life to the fullest to be loyal.

(Singing) I think of my lifelong integrity and impartiality, a speck of loyal heart to repay the Song Dynasty. It's all because the Mongol barbarians invaded, and the mountains and rivers were lost, a regret that is hard to dispel. This time, I mistakenly fell into a trap, and they captured me alive. I can only throw away my head, which is not a pity. Wait for the future historians to record my name. While he was deep in thought, how could he know that Hongfan was inviting him from inside with great respect?

(Narration) Zhang Hongfan was sitting in his camp at this time, inviting Tianxiang inside, wanting to persuade him. Therefore, seeing Tianxiang being brought up bound, he hurriedly greeted him with a smiling face, saying—

(Zhang's spoken words) Prime Minister Wen, I, Hongfan, have greatly offended your esteemed presence. I hope the old Prime Minister will forgive my offense.

(Narration) As Zhang Hongfan spoke, he intended to respectfully salute Prime Minister Wen, untie the ropes, and make a very sincere gesture, but Wen Tianxiang simply closed his eyes and said nothing. Hongfan forced a laugh and said—

(Zhang's spoken words) Prime Minister Wen, I am being polite. Hahaha, I must ask for your forgiveness.

(Wen's spoken words) You are so respectful to me, what do you want me to do?

(Zhang's spoken words) Haha, Hongfan has nothing else in mind, only that your good friend Zhang Shijie of Mount Wuyi is very powerful. I intend to ask the Prime Minister to write a letter, inviting him to surrender to our Yuan Dynasty, to avoid my general having to fight him.

(Wen sneers) Hahaha, are you mistaken?

(Wen's singing) I am a loyal minister of the Song Dynasty. I must repay the emperor's favor. I only know the Song Dynasty as my parents. If my parents are there, I will live. Today, I am ashamed that the Song Dynasty is hard to protect. How can I steal another life? You still want me to write a friendly letter, what kind of heart is it to trap people in injustice? I think, since ancient times, who can avoid death? Leave a loyal heart shining in history. This is my old poem, a lifelong ambition. Everyone has their own ambitions, do not encroach on each other.

(Wen's spoken words) Everyone has their own ambitions, you don't need to say more, quickly get out of my sight.

(Narration) Seeing that he was dignified and unyielding, Zhang Hongfan had no choice but to imprison him. After a few days, the Yuan Dynasty conquered Mount Wuyi, and the Yuan soldiers held a grand celebration feast in the camp. Hongfan then invited Tianxiang out again and said to him,

(Zhang's spoken words) Mr. Wen, you are a hero. Now listen to my candid advice.

(Zhang's singing) Now the Southern Song has fallen, and the mighty Yuan Dynasty has been established. It is often said that going against heaven is difficult, but following heaven's will is naturally prosperous. You are a dignified Prime Minister of the Song Dynasty, a generation of hero with a famous name. Why not create a new career, surrender to my lord without worry, and you can still be granted official rank and establish a court. Those who understand the times are heroes, advise you to consider it carefully.

(Wen says) Bah! You are talking nonsense. Do you think that I, Wen, am a fickle person?

(Wen's singing) Loyal ministers do not serve two masters, their determination is as firm as copper and iron. I am already a prime minister of the Song Dynasty, how can I be an official of the Yuan Dynasty again? As the saying goes, no eggs are left unbroken under an overturned nest, how can one survive when the country is destroyed? Moreover, since ancient times, China has been called a great nation, and the barbarians have been subservient for thousands of years. Now that barbarians are emperors, what face do I have to live in this world? I might as well die a clean death, to avoid being scolded by others. Therefore, we each have our own lord, do not talk nonsense like a madman. You can cut me down if you want, a loyal minister is not afraid of death in the Yellow Springs.

(Wen's spoken words) You don't need to say more, kill me if you want, slice me if you want. I, Wen Tianxiang, am not a greedy or profit-seeking person. If the country is gone, it is useless to live.

(Narration) Seeing that he was unyielding, Zhang Hongfan had no choice but to send him to Yanjing. The Yuan Prime Minister Boluo also wanted to persuade Tianxiang to surrender, but Tianxiang was determined and refused to comply. Therefore, he was finally killed in Yanjing, but his reputation will never fade away.

(Wen's singing) Boluo also wanted to persuade him to surrender, but Tianxiang was full of pride, unyielding and unbowed, willing to die quickly and exhaust his loyalty. Boluo knew it was difficult to persuade him, so he had to imprison him in a jail for three long years. Later, on the day of his execution at the Caishi execution ground in the capital, he calmly met his death, and his name became fragrant.

General Knowledge

### Newspaper Reading Threshold (Continued 1)

— Tan Tian

How can one teach people? However, solving the newspaper reading threshold for people like the little old man does not depend on how refined one is. As long as one can roughly tell him how to identify news, utilize news, and choose news, that is enough. Why must one have deep and broad knowledge? Right, that's how I plan to talk to the little old man about the newspaper reading threshold.

Newspapers and News Little old man, listen to me. You should read the newspaper every day, right? Reading the newspaper can let you know about national affairs, can let you know about future fortunes and misfortunes, and can serve as a reference for your own actions. As the saying goes, "Scholars don't go out, but can know about the world." Don't you want to be a scholar? If you don't understand, it doesn't matter. We will take some time every day, meet a few people, in your attic, and we will all study it together. It's not me bragging, there is a white louse on the newspaper, I know it has a leg. No matter what news agency, no matter how much they brag, I can find out its fox tail. Listen to me, every night, we will study. Now I will first tell you some Shanhaijing [Classic of Mountains and Seas] for you to listen to.

What is News

The two characters "news," in the eyes of the average person, are very familiar characters, but if you ask what the meaning of news actually is, I am afraid that few people know. It is said that ten years ago, the United States Congress offered a reward to solicit a definition of news. The first place winner's definition of news was quite detailed. He said, "News is a commodity, distributed by newspapers, for people who can read to consume." This statement is naturally the statement of a capitalist society, but in a socialist society, the statement is different. Take the current Soviet Union, for example. Their definition is, "News is a weapon of agitation, propaganda, and organization. Newspapers like Pravda and Trud newspaper uphold their own class, and expose the improprieties of society, not a commodity." From this, we can clearly understand the "meaning of news." It changes with the transformation of the times, environment, and social system. To be honest, under certain conditions, news is the only weapon of a country's government to lead the people, inspire the people, educate the people, and unite the people to attack the other side.

The Function of Newspapers The most fashionable saying now is, "Newspapers are the mouthpiece of the people, the public opinion of society." We believe that this statement can only be said in certain eras. Now we can only say in general, "Newspapers are a tool for transmitting news. Newspapers and news both change with the changes of the times and social and political systems. There is nothing fixed and unchanging in the world." We must be clearly aware of this point at all times. Here, we might as well mention the function of newspapers in passing. For example, changes in the weather, movements of personnel, newspapers record these things every day. If people who don't read the newspaper go to transport goods and do business, they will not know the weather, nor the market. If there is banditry in a certain place, it will be published in the newspaper early. If you don't read the newspaper and go there rashly, wouldn't it be extremely dangerous? Also, there are many refugees in Shanghai now. Some of them are caused by the war in Shanghai, and some are caused by the war in the interior. If newspapers had not first advocated for disaster relief, wouldn't the refugees have starved to death? In addition, international events also often affect our lives. People who know the world situation have methods to prepare and cope. A person who doesn't read the newspaper, no matter what, will suffer. People who don't read the newspaper live a muddled life, and everything goes wrong.

Newspaper Policy

It is said that in the past, the Roman Emperor Alexander IV, in order to prevent religions different from the Roman Church from invading, issued a decree banning illegal printed matter. At that time, he regarded the speech of different religions as illegal. Later, this method spread to various countries, and was increasingly expanded to suppress all other anti-state, diplomatic, military, political, and economic speeches and publications. Now it has become a general law for governments to block speech and publication. It limits the news of newspapers, allowing only news that is beneficial to the government. All opposing news, or news containing illegal elements, are restricted. This is called newspaper policy. Its method of restriction is to censor news. Usually, when we see a large section suddenly empty in the newspaper (commonly known as "opening a window"), that is an example of it. But speaking to this point, some people may ask, "Since this is the case, what is the point of newspapers?" It is not said that way. Within a certain range, newspapers still have the value of transmitting news, but they cannot record everything that is heard. However, people who have the ability to distinguish news can still see the words beyond the news.

Newspaper Extras

The two characters "extra," at a glance, you can know that it is not a normal newspaper. It is a small newspaper, issued when the situation is tense, and there is a special change, and the newspaper office does not have time to wait until the next morning to publish it. For example, when the Chinese army recaptured Guangzhou, as soon as the telegram arrived in Shanghai, an extra was immediately printed and published. But this is only limited to the surrounding area where the newspaper is located. More distant towns and cities still have to wait until the next day's first news to see it, but it is a little later. Newspaper Supplements A newspaper supplement occupies half a page or a full page of the newspaper. The content published on it is not news at all, but some texts related to history, geography, literature, common sense, etc. This is to adjust the readers' appetite, and satisfy the location of knowledge. Therefore, some people say that newspapers are a treasure trove of human knowledge. That's what it means. In addition, there are more special supplements. But the content is similar to the supplement, but with some temporary nature.

Special Articles and Commentaries

Newspapers often have a single article, either by a famous person or by an expert, which is marked with the words "special article" to show the difference. This kind of text is for readers to study and refer to. Its position is mostly in a corner of the news, and it is not published on a regular basis. As for commentaries, they are published every day. Its remarks must represent the newspaper's position, and its subject matter must be related to the important news of the time. Therefore, commentaries are more noticed by readers. Because it can not only point out the changes and causes of facts, but also point out the ways to solve the facts. It can create the foundation of public opinion.

### Jenner, the Inventor of Vaccination

— Yi of Jenner

Whenever smallpox (commonly known as Tianhua) is mentioned, everyone knows that it is a very terrible infectious disease. Before the invention of vaccination, how many people died of this disease or became pockmarked every year is unknown. Naturally, after the invention of vaccination, mankind had a way to prevent and avoid contracting smallpox.

The earliest invention of vaccination should be attributed to our China. Our country invented vaccination in the Song Dynasty to prevent smallpox. However, because the method was too troublesome and the reaction was too severe, after the Western cowpox technique was introduced into China, our country's inherent method was no longer adopted by the medical community.

I think our readers have probably all been vaccinated with cowpox. After being vaccinated with cowpox, we are immune to smallpox. If we get vaccinated once every three years, then we will not be infected. Today we are going to talk about this savior who invented vaccination!

Before the invention of vaccination, smallpox was also common in various parts of England. At that time, an Englishman, Mr. Jenner, saw that the cows in the Glancestershire area also often suffered from cowpox, but their cowpox was different from that of us humans, limited only to a part of the body and not spreading to the whole body. Cowpox in cows mostly occurs in their udders, so many women who milk cows often get a few cowpoxes because the skin on their hands is injured, and the wounds are infected with the pus from the cow's pox, but the symptoms are very mild and do not spread to the whole body, and it is said that those women who have contracted cowpox will not get smallpox much in the future.

While hating the harm of smallpox to humans, Jenner personally saw and heard these strange facts. He thought: This is a truly amazing discovery. Why don't I study a method to prevent smallpox from this strange phenomenon?

Jenner finally decided to use his own beloved son as a test product, taking the concentrated juice from the cow's milk (nipple) that had smallpox and transplanting it into his beloved son's body. When he pierced his son's skin with a needle tip, his heart was cut like a knife, and his eyes were full of tears. He thought: If my son gets immunity from smallpox after vaccination, then people all over the world can be saved. This is such a great thing. If unfortunately it fails, then we should sacrifice for the sake of the world's people without regret. Finally, he decided to transplant the concentrated juice into the newly broken wound of his son. His son went through a day of pain, and as a result, only the transplanted part produced pus, forming a smallpox, which did not spread to the whole body. You can imagine how happy Jenner was.

After the results of this experiment, Jenner continued to study for many years before proving that humans who are vaccinated with cowpox can indeed gain immunity and will not be infected with human smallpox again. He published this painstaking research, but at first, the world did not deeply believe in cowpox vaccination. Later, because of the remarkable effect, it was valued by the world.

Now cowpox vaccination has spread all over the world, and almost all countries have laws that force people to be vaccinated. We can prevent the spread of smallpox by being vaccinated with cowpox.

Now is really the time to plant cowpox. If you have friends who have not been vaccinated, I hope you will go to get vaccinated quickly!

### Ballad of the Road

— Lu Rongshou

War ravages, people can't make a living.

Homeless, become refugees.

Wandering the streets, losing one's footing.

Ate breakfast, no supper.

Cold wind blows, only death.

Crying faintly, how can I bear it.

All my compatriots, generously give money.

Save a life, express my inch of heart.

### Weekly War Report

In the past week, there have been no large-scale battles on the northern and southern fronts. It is unknown whether the Japanese army is reorganizing and dispatching troops, but the Chinese army is taking advantage of the situation and making attrition contacts everywhere. Although no great achievements have been established, it also has considerable value, for example

North Jiangxi Front

The Japanese army operating in the Lushan area has been there for many days. After several contacts with the Chinese army, it seems to have lost its momentum. A unit of the Japanese army, under the cover of aircraft, advanced towards the Good Man Slope area again, attempting to seize Guling. The Chinese army fiercely countered, and the two sides launched a fierce battle. The accuracy of the Chinese artillery this time was beyond the Japanese army's expectations. As a result, the Japanese army had to retreat. The war in Duchang has not subsided. The Chinese army continued to make efforts to recover Jianghuo Mountain and encountered the Japanese troops on the lake surface south of the city. Both sides suffered damage. Another unit of the Japanese army fired artillery at the Chinese army on the north bank of the Xiushui River. The artillery was mostly tear gas, forcing the Chinese army to retreat. At night, more than four or five hundred Japanese infantrymen searched and advanced separately towards the vicinity of the Guanyin Pavilion in Shansha Duma Village, and were about to move towards Tujiapu. The Chinese army gave a head-on blow, and is now in a stalemate.

Shanxi Front

The Japanese army stationed in Fushan, Jinxi, has more than a thousand people. In the past few days, after continuous attacks by the Chinese army, they have suffered considerable losses, and most of them have moved westward. There are still more than 500 Japanese troops remaining in the city. The Chinese army divided its forces and besieged the city again the day before yesterday. After several hours of fighting, the Japanese army was unable to hold on and went to Linfen. Seeing that the Japanese army had left, the Chinese army recovered the county seat. In Anyi, Huoxian, Linjin and other places in southern Jin, there are frequent battles between the Chinese and Japanese sides, and in the battle of Linjin, a unit of the puppet army led by Su Chao, with a thousand men and complete weapons, suddenly took the opportunity to respond and rebel when the Chinese army was approaching, causing the Japanese army to be attacked from both sides and suffering extremely heavy losses. As for Huoxian, since it was recovered by the Chinese army, the Japanese army has launched a large-scale attack again. This time, the Japanese artillery fire was so fierce that it formed a fire net. The Chinese army fought back fiercely with a determination to die. The two sides' positions were in and out several times, and a stalemate was reached. Another unit of the Chinese army took the opportunity to counterattack Jingle, and the Japanese army felt it difficult to cope.

Guangdong Front

The Japanese army in Guangdong has been frequently deploying troops recently. On the one hand, it is stepping up the construction of defensive works, and on the other hand, it is rushing to build gun emplacements in various places on Hainan Island and Haikou. Now Wenchang, Ding'an, and Lishan have successively built airfields and warehouses, planning to use them as air force bases, which seems to have a long-term plan. As for sporadic battles, the Chinese and Japanese armies have fought fiercely in Shunde, Shengang, Ding'an, Wenchang, Huanshan and other places. The Japanese planes have carried out indiscriminate bombing, which has long aroused the resentment of the local people. Therefore, a large number of people have joined the army to fight bravely, which has been quite successful. Now the entire Japanese army is under the surveillance of the Chinese army, and any activity will be attacked.

Central Hubei Front

Since the fall of Zhongxiang in the war in central Hubei, the Japanese army has been actively repairing the Hanyi and Jingzhong highways, and rushing to build fortifications in Yangqing (ten kilometers east of Zhongxiang) and Pumenchong (twelve kilometers northwest of Yangzi) to consolidate its defense. Therefore, the war situation in that area has been quiet for the past week. The Japanese army in Duoerwan has been constantly shelling the opposite shore of Shayang, trying to test the Chinese army. However, the Chinese army also fired back, and the artillery hit the Japanese army's powder magazine, and the fire soared into the sky for a while, which could not be contained. In addition, the enemy at the Hongdongnan Port Ferry has been active on the west bank of the Xiang River, and has been surrounded by the Chinese army several times without success. The two sides are still fighting each other with artillery across the river. It is feared that it will be difficult for the Japanese army to cross the Xiang River.

### I am a Refugee

— Refugee Reporter

I am a refugee!

Before I was a refugee, I was a good citizen, a "law-abiding" good citizen.

However, now I am a refugee! Now I am very aware: to be a citizen, it is not enough to just be law-abiding.

Being law-abiding is like powerless grass, and like sand scattered on the ground.

When the wind blows, the grass cannot but fall, and the sand cannot but be blown away.

So I have become a refugee, and I am very fortunate. Fortunately, I have gone through an ordeal. In the future, I will not only be a "law-abiding" good citizen.

I hope: in the future, I will plant myself into a tree with roots that cannot be blown down by the wind; I will condense myself into cohesive soil that cannot be blown away by the wind. Only in this way will I not have wasted the efforts of my compatriots who came to save me!

### Defend Nanchang

— Maolie

The intermittent war of the past five months has now entered a fierce stage due to the enemy's attack on Nanchang. Of course, the enemy's intention is to interrupt the Zhejiang-Guangxi Railway, and to separate our Third War Zone and Ninth War Zone. In addition, it is to give its allies and its own people a kind of stimulation, indicating that they are still working hard to maintain their prestige, which is rapidly declining.

We will not discuss for the time being whether their Golden Plan can achieve its goal, but even if they really interrupt the Zhejiang-Guangxi Railway, and really excite their allies and their own people, what will they ultimately gain? Isn't it the same as before, with more consumption, which is exactly what we want! Our arrangements have long reached the point where we can fight each other and contact each other under any circumstances. They want to strike us militarily, which is completely wishful thinking. As for their allies, they have long seen their incompetence, and this kind of expression will not be effective at all, otherwise why would they use Qingdao and the Caroline Islands as bait to win them over with sweet words and generous gifts!

However, we must not reduce our defense of Nanchang for these reasons. On the contrary, we should take advantage of their exhausted strength and give them a severe blow to make them unable to recover. They have almost no troops left to be transferred domestically for this decisive attack, and they are pieced together from various places. After this final offensive is over, I can say that it is like a flash in the pan, shining for a moment, and then falling into darkness. We should seize this opportunity.

Their attack is still the old method: aiming at one place, transferring troops from various places to go there; aiming at one point, and rushing forward regardless of everything. Now the place they are aiming at is Nanchang, and the point they are aiming at is the key points between the Xiu River, Feng River, and Liao River. Then we can take this opportunity to counterattack the places where their troops are empty, and at the same time, like in Taierzhuang, give them individual encirclement and annihilation.

According to today's news, our "counterattack is in separate ways, and the situation has stabilized." Our goal of defending Nanchang can be achieved soon. I hope that our Nanchang, among the major cities, will always stand side by side with Changsha, as a mainstay on the Guangdong-Han and Zhejiang-Guangxi railways.

### Reply to a Japanese Poet

— Written by Rabindranath Tagore, Translated by Zhefei

(Translator's Note: Although the title of this article is "Reply to a Japanese Poet," its content is essentially a general critique of the entire Japanese intellectual class.)

Your letter truly astonished me. Its content is so different from the Japanese spirit I understand, and my high regard for your work, as well as my personal relationship with you, were originally based on that spirit.

It is heartbreaking to think that the arrogance of Fascist militarism has even encroached upon the realm of creative artists, and that true intellectual power is willing to sacrifice its dignity and truth before the dark god of war.

Regarding Italy's Fascist massacre of Abyssinia, you seem to agree with me; but regarding the massacre of millions of Chinese people, you judge it from a different perspective. You protest that Japan is in a special position, but you forget that the same excuse is used in every war. Ardent warmongers always believe that their brutal acts are justified for a special reason.

You say that this method, "though terrible, is inevitable" and necessary for building a new world in Asia (in other words, indiscriminately bombing Chinese women and children, destroying their temples and universities—these are the only ways to preserve Asia's Chinese people).

The principle of "Asia for Asians," which you repeatedly praised in your letter, is filled with the worst characteristics of Europe, yet completely lacks the best virtues of human nature—the virtue of uniting people regardless of political divides.

When I read the recent speeches of Tokyo politicians, I couldn't help but laugh when they said, "The military alliance between Japan and Germany is built on spiritual and moral foundations and does not conceal external materialistic conditions." It is absurd that artists and thinkers also adopt this kind of sentimentalism that disguises military violence as spiritual might.

Even at the height of wartime frenzy, many great Western thinkers have shouted above the voices of the masses, challenging war profiteers in the name of humanity. Although persecuted, they would never sell the conscience of the people they represent. I believe there are also figures of this great spirit in Japan, but Japanese newspapers dare not mention them, because if they do not follow the will of the military leaders, their fate is destined to be diminished.

The betrayal of the intellectual class is one of the greatest dangerous symbols of our time.

You speak of the frugality of the poor people of Japan, their suffering and silent sacrifice, which makes you proud, but this kind of sad sacrifice is only for the sake of invading neighboring countries and bombing the homes of enemy people. I know that propaganda has now become an art, and non-democratic countries can hardly resist the temptation of this poison that increasingly corrodes them; however, I hope that the "intellectual class" can still maintain their independence. Unfortunately, the actual situation is far from it: behind many false arguments lies a stubborn nationalism, forcing today's "intellectual class" to exaggerate their "ideology" and use violent methods to force the masses toward death.

I know your people very well, so I don't believe they would deliberately participate in this kind of organized poisoning, dragging Chinese men and women into the sea of opium and heroin. Your people don't know about this, but Japanese colonists in China are engaged in this destructive undertaking on a large scale. There is already a lot of irrefutable evidence proving this fact, and no protest has been heard in Japan, not even from poets.

After assessing the thinking patterns of your intellectual class, I am no longer surprised by your government's permission for them to express their opinions "freely." I hope they can cherish their freedom!

Another symbol of the intellectual class's betrayal is their endorsement of the government's destruction of the foundations of the lives of neighboring peoples while enjoying preferential treatment from the government.

I know that one day the disillusionment of your people will come. At that time, they will understand that this reckless aggression against China is the destruction of the spirit of Japanese samurai, a destruction that is now proceeding with cruel brutality.

China is invincible! Her culture, under the protection of the brave General Chiang Kai-shek, is demonstrating its astonishing richness. Thanks to the loyalty of her people, an unprecedented unity is now seen, and a new era is beginning in China. Temporary defeats will never destroy her awakened soul.

Due to various disputes, China was often unprepared to cope with the huge trap of forced war, but now she has secured her position. Compared with Japan's military science—which is barbaric in nature and Western in style—China's attitude shows moral superiority.

You have not recognized that you are raising the status of your neighbor yourselves. But there are other considerations here. Madame Chiang Kai-shek said in "The Observer" that Japan is creating many "ghosts," destroying China's memorable works of art, destroying many irreplaceable Chinese academic institutions, and abusing peaceful societies.

Madame Chiang Kai-shek asked, "Who will eliminate those ghosts?"

We hope that in the near future, the people of China and Japan can join hands again and forget all the painful memories of the past. Only then can the true Asia be revived.

Japanese poets should raise their voices and unflinchingly affirm their faith in the future of mankind, in which the products of mutually destructive science will no longer have a place. (Translated from Europa Magazine)

### Repairing the Sheepfold After the Loss

### Reading and Newspaper Insights (Part 1)

— Tu Lao

The Austrian philosopher Otto Weininger spent his life desperately attacking women. In his great work "Geschlecht und Charakter," he used various methods to prove that women cannot be equal to men, which was truly formidable. However, strangely, it is said that after writing this book, he became extremely depressed and soon committed suicide with a pistol.

Chinese Professor Liang XX once said: "The modern so-called movement for equality between men and women originated from the denial of the differences between men and women." This seems to be copied from the words of that Austrian philosopher. The professor also advocated: "Proper female education should be to make women complete women." This is even more thoroughly consistent with the philosopher's point of view.

Who says that what exists in foreign countries does not exist in China?

But the development of the two is different, but they are equally strange: that Austrian scholar looked down on women and only looked up to men, but in the end, he looked down on himself, who was indeed a man. This Chinese professor shouted that there should be differences between men and women, but during the national crisis, when he participated in the deliberation of national affairs, he advocated quickly "peace," obviously wanting all the men in the country, including himself (not to mention women), to become the women he idealized "without difference." ——It's really mysterious and inexplicable, making people dizzy!

During the Qing Dynasty, high-ranking officials who could meet the emperor, Manchus always called themselves "slaves," while Han Chinese could only call themselves "subjects." On the surface, "subject" seems to be more noble than "slave," but in fact, the opposite is true. "Slaves" were the emperor's confidants, while "subjects" still had to look at the "slaves." That is to say, "slaves" were one level higher than "subjects."

But did high-ranking officials who were Han Chinese at the time feel a little uncomfortable? I think there would be. Finally, I found materials that revealed this information.

In the eleventh month of the thirty-eighth year of Qianlong, the emperor commented: "...In the past, memorials were written by Manchu officials who always called themselves 'slaves,' while Han officials always called themselves 'subjects.' This is just an old example passed down,... It is not the case that calling oneself a 'slave' means being close and respectful, and calling oneself a 'subject' means being estranged and rude... In the future, all Manchu and Han officials, whether internal or external, should all call themselves 'subjects' to show uniformity. This is hereby ordered."

This is clearly an explanation to the Han officials, telling you not to be jealous. However, being a "slave" is still not possible, and you can only be a subject.

But this imperial edict is still just deceiving people. We only need to check the memorials of Manchu and Han ministers later to understand. For a period of time in the middle, perhaps everyone was really a "subject," but later, until the end of the Qing Dynasty, Manchu ministers were still "slaves," while Han ministers were always subjects.

Myself, son, grandson, great-grandson, great-great-grandson...kneeling down to my great Qing Dynasty for more than two hundred years, but in the end, I am still "wanting to be a slave but unable to be." Alas!

### From Defeat to Revival

— Qian Changnian

The wind blowing towards us is no longer as strong as before, and it will no longer make the bodies of people tremble with cold.

Under the withered branches and fallen leaves, a tender green sprout emerges.

Spring has finally arrived.

Spring is the season for returning from defeat to revival; it is the time when evil forces are destroyed!

On the fields that have been nourished by the dismembered flesh and blood of our people and irrigated with hot tears, countless sprouts have grown!

These countless sprouts will turn into a bright and beautiful flower, although they still have to go through a difficult journey.

Endure it with gritted teeth! The dangerous road is coming to an end!

Spring, I want to sing your praises! Because: you have buried all violence! At the same time, you have led justice from defeat to the road of revival!

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

The agreed day arrived, and Chen, the town chief, felt as if seventeen or eighteen little deer were jumping around in his heart. The wedding time was set for 2 p.m., but the carnival began at noon. In the township office, the banquet stretched from the auditorium to the innermost courtyard. All the puppet soldiers of the X army were invited to the banquet, and everyone was allowed to drink without limit. The table in the center of the auditorium was particularly sumptuous, and it was set up by Town Chief Chen specifically to entertain the X army officers, the leader of the pacification team, and One-Eyed Li. He did not invite other guests to accompany them, because this table of wine was no different from death-summoning wine, and he could not bear to harm innocent people.

Before the banquet even began, Town Chief Chen had already entrusted the arsenic he had to Old Wang, a trusted handyman, instructing him to dissolve it in the wine jugs. He told him to make a secret mark on the wine jugs to indicate which one contained poison and which one did not. This was because he still harbored the idea of "preserving the whole," wanting to use the poisoned wine to poison those heinous villains while preserving himself with the non-poisoned wine.

At noon, the township office was already filled with people, and the sounds of laughter and chatter swelled until the room could no longer contain them. The pacification team leader was particularly happy because today was his wedding day, almost to the point of losing himself in delight. He kept stroking the little mustache above his philtrum with his hand. Only Town Chief Chen was an exception at the banquet. There was no joy in his heart, only bitterness and confusion. However, in order to avoid being seen through, he had to force a smile. After all, when something is on one's mind, even a forced smile will always seem unnatural from the outside.

After everyone was seated, Old Wang, the handyman, brought two jugs of wine to Town Chief Chen. Having received instructions from Town Chief Chen, he had already made secret marks on the wine jugs. The lid of the non-poisonous jug had a small piece of red paper glued to it. No one but Town Chief Chen noticed it. Town Chief Chen was meticulous in his haste. He knew that pure silver cups and chopsticks would turn black if they came into contact with poison, so he had already put them away and replaced them with glass cups and ebony chopsticks. He stood up, ready to pour wine for everyone, when One-Eyed Li suddenly reached out to snatch his wine jug and said:

"Today you are the father-in-law, you should sit comfortably. Let me do the job of toasting."

"What are you talking about? Today you are the guests, and I am the host. How can there be a reason to reverse the roles of guest and host?" Town Chief Chen said stubbornly, refusing.

In fact, if Town Chief Chen had let One-Eyed Li do the toasting, he might have been able to protect himself, because One-Eyed Li did not know that there was poison in the wine. Even if he toasted the guests with the non-poisonous wine first, Town Chief Chen could have made an excuse not to drink when it was time to toast with the poisonous wine. However, he feared that One-Eyed Li would see through the plot, so he insisted on toasting the wine himself. He was also eager to succeed. He started by toasting the guests with the poisonous wine. At the same time, because he had never done this kind of thing before, he was inevitably a little timid. When toasting, he held the wine jug and shook uncontrollably, which aroused One-Eyed Li's suspicion. One-Eyed Li saw that Town Chief Chen had toasted everyone's wine, and there was still a lot of wine left in the jug, so he switched the wine jug to pour wine for himself. This made his suspicion even greater. Therefore, just as Town Chief Chen raised his glass to encourage everyone to drink, he suddenly shouted: "Wait!" and took a glass of wine from in front of him and gave it to Town Chief Chen, saying: (43)

Special Shanghai Issue

### Shanghai's Telecommunications Industry

— Fang Ziwei

Overview

Shanghai, being China's largest city, also boasts the most developed telecommunications industry. The scope of what is considered "telecommunications" is quite broad. Generally, it can be divided into wired and wireless telecommunications. Any use of radio waves to transmit text, signals, speech, sounds, images, and projections is collectively termed "wireless telecommunications." In China, the establishment of wireless telecommunications began in the 31st year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign when the Navy Ministry installed Marconi-type wireless telegraphs on the warships Hai Rong, Hai Chen, Hai Qi, and Hai Chou. The Army also set up military radio stations in Tianjin, Baoding, and Nanyuan. According to the Telecommunications Regulations promulgated in August of the 18th year of the Republic, China's wireless communications, except for those used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force, are managed by the Ministry of Communications. Due to space limitations, this article will only discuss wireless telecommunications. Shanghai established its first radio station in the 34th year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign, and it has made significant progress over the past thirty-odd years. Before August 13th, domestic communications could reach the border provinces and cities, and international communications extended to Europe, America, Africa, and other countries. Direct wireless telephone connections existed with Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, and other countries, with a very developed business. Various other radio stations served specific purposes for sea, land, and air communications. The following aspects will be discussed separately.

(1) Telegraph Bureau Radio Stations: China has been establishing wireless communications for thirty-three years. In the era of long waves, there were few radio stations, and the results were not significant. After the 15th year of the Republic, short waves flourished, and the results were greatly improved. However, there were times when there were two sides in wireless communications, which, due to business relationships and the negotiations between the Ministry of Communications and the Construction Commission, caused various disputes. This was a phenomenon that should not have existed in a country's telecommunications administration; however, the competition between them led them to seek improvements. On April 1st of the 23rd year of the Republic, the Ministry of Communications ordered the merger of all wireless communications in the country. Shanghai established the Wireless Communications Headquarters on Min Guo Road at the Lao Bei Men (Old North Gate). The transmitters had power levels of 15, 100, 100, 250, and 500 watts, using wavelengths from 25 meters to 105 meters. There were a total of seventeen lines communicating with important cities across the country, reaching as far as Dihua in Xinjiang and Lhasa in Tibet. Wireless telephone connections were also established with Hankou and Guangzhou. The telegraph types included ordinary and urgent telegrams, as well as newly opened services, meteorological information, and congratulatory messages, all with categorized pricing methods for the convenience of the public.

(2) International Radio Stations: Among the radio stations established in Shanghai, the earliest with international characteristics were the XSG radio station of the Wusong Wireless Telegraph Bureau and the XSH radio station of the Shanghai Wireless Line Station, as these two stations were the first to communicate with ships from various countries at sea. In October of the 17th year of the Republic, the National Government's Construction Commission purchased international main station equipment from the German Telefunken Wireless Company, ordered Sino-American radio station equipment from the American RCA, and purchased Sino-French radio station equipment from the French Long Distance Telephone Company. The transmitting station was located in Zhenru, Shanghai, the receiving station in Liuhang Town in Baoshan County, and the central receiving and transmitting office in the Sassoon House on Renji Road. An international branch station was built at Fenglin Bridge, initially communicating with the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Java. After the Ministry of Communications took over in August of the 18th year, it actively proceeded. Over the years, it successively (see separate table) communicated telegrams and telephones with countries on all continents, with a total of thirteen lines (see separate table). The types of communications included (1) ordinary, (2) urgent, (3) news, (4) official, (5) congratulatory, (6) letters, and (7) meteorological information. After the 19th year, business flourished. The average monthly income was 150,000 in the 21st year, 330,000 in the 23rd year, and the annual income was 6.49 million in the 24th year, reaching 7.96 million in the 25th year. International wireless communication has a close relationship with increasing mutual understanding and developing commerce between countries. This can be seen from the aforementioned figures.

(3) Coastal Radio Stations: Coastal radio stations are dedicated to communicating with ships at sea. The existence of coastal radio stations in Shanghai originated from the XSG radio station of the Wusong Wireless Telegraph Bureau and the XH radio station of Shanghai. The Wusong radio station was established in the 34th year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign, initially located at the Lion Ridge of Fengxian County, simultaneously with the radio station on Chongming Island. The reason for its establishment was that the sea line between Shanghai and Chongming was broken, and it was used to transmit official and commercial telegrams. In the first year of the Xuantong Emperor's reign, a British businessman set up a radio station in the Astor House hotel to communicate with ships at sea. Jiang Zunqi, the Director of the Postal Department at the time, negotiated with the British Minister Aitken and recovered it for the Chinese government to operate independently, attached to the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau on Simalu (now Central China Road). In the early years of the Republic, during the early stages of the European War in the third year of the Republic, the French built a radio station FZ in the French military camp in Gujiazhai and registered it with the Benoist Society, openly receiving and sending commercial telegrams and ship telegrams, with a monthly income of about 5,000 yuan. In the fourth year of the Republic, the Ministry of Communications purchased a 5-kilowatt spark gap transmitter from the German Siemens Company and began communicating with Chinese and foreign ships. In the 18th year, due to the development of business, a new 5-kilowatt vacuum tube transmitter and new receiver from Telefunken were added. Except for the Shanghai radio station XSH, which was dismantled, the station was destroyed in the battle on January 28th. Later, the Ministry of Communications contracted with the American Dahlberg Corporation to build a new station in Hongqiao. From then on, it became a purely coastal radio station, dedicated to ship communications. After August 13th, it moved to Guangdong Road. The station is related to the safety of life and property at sea, and the convenience of merchants. After the world wireless inventor Marconi came to China in the 22nd year, he sent a telegram to fourteen scientific organizations in Shanghai via the Italian Conte Rosso on his way back to his country, which was transmitted by this station.

(4) Ship Radio Stations: The earliest Chinese ships to install wireless telegraphs were the Hua Jia and Hua Yi. After the Ministry of Communications ordered that ships exceeding 500 tons should be equipped with wireless telegraphs, Chinese merchant ships have successively complied with the order. Shanghai's commerce is developed, and the number of ships entering and leaving the port is large. Ship radio stations are mobile in nature and are managed by the Telegraph Bureau under the Ministry of Communications.

(5) Dedicated Radio Stations: Dedicated radio stations are those set up by various special agencies and large enterprises with government approval, solely for their own business communications. Among the dedicated radio stations in Shanghai, apart from the Army and Navy, the earliest were the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Central Bank in the 17th year of the Republic. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's main station was located within the company's address on the Bund on Simalu, communicating with the Nanjing branch station and the radio stations on various ships of the company. The Central Bank's main station was located in its office on Jiujiang Road, communicating with Central Banks in various locations. After the 18th year, the Ministry of Finance's station in Shanghai, located within the Central Bank, was established, followed by the China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation radio stations, which were established at Hongqiao Airport and Longhua Airport, communicating with Nanjing, Beiping, Xi'an, Hankou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other airport stations, as well as with all thirty-plus aircraft of the two companies. The Jianghai Customs set up a radio station in Hongkou, communicating with customs offices along the coast and their patrol ships. The Dredging Bureau set up a radio station in Dinghaizhou, communicating with dredging ships at the mouth of the Yangtze River. The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Bureau also set up its own radio station to communicate with major stations along the line.

(6) Broadcasting Stations: Shanghai had broadcasting stations as early as the 13th year of the Republic. At that time, the Wing On Company set up a station on the rooftop garden of its company on Nanjing Road, but it was ordered to stop by the Ministry of Communications. Subsequently, the American Carlow Company set up a 250-watt window station on Fuxing Road. After the 19th year of the Republic, many private individuals and groups in China and abroad established stations, reaching more than fifty. Unfortunately, the local authorities lacked adequate management, resulting in simple equipment and poor quality, and interference was the most serious problem. In November of the 20th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Communications reviewed and cracked down, allocated frequencies, and imposed restrictions, leaving only about twenty stations. In the 23rd year, the Ministry of Communications built the Shanghai Broadcasting Station to lead the way. In the 25th year, the municipal government also set up a broadcasting station in the city center. From then on, Shanghai had thirty-three public and private broadcasting stations, with power ranging from 15 watts to 30, 50, 100, 200, 250, and 500 watts, using frequencies from 570 to 1480 kilocycles, making it the city with the most broadcasting stations in the country.

(7) Meteorological Radio Stations: Father Froc, of the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory, had receiving equipment as early as the first year of the Republic, specifically for receiving time signals reported by major European and American radio stations. In the third year of the Republic, the French station FFZ was established, and the daily weather reports from the observatory's meteorological station were broadcast by the station. The times were 11:55 am and 4:55 pm, day after day, benefiting sailing ships. In the 13th year, the Wusong coastal radio station XSG also began broadcasting weather information. After the 17th year, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company radio station and the Navy's Coastal Patrol Department radio station also successively broadcast weather information at set times. In April of the 22nd year, for the convenience of ships, the Jianghai Customs set up radio beacon stations at the Liujiaoshan, Huaniaodao, and Sheshan lighthouses, broadcasting weather conditions and issuing storm and fog warnings at set times to allow ships to prepare, with a wavelength of 1000 meters.

(8) Amateur Radio Stations: Amateur radio stations are established by those who study wireless communications as a hobby. The earliest amateur researcher in Shanghai was a student from Nanyang University in the early years of the Republic. Later, more and more Chinese people studied it. In the 18th year of the Republic, there was an organization called the China Amateur Wireless Radio Society, with more than 300 members and more than 30 amateur radio stations. At the same time, foreigners in Shanghai also had an organization called the International Amateur Wireless Radio Association, with dozens of members and more than 20 amateur radio stations. These amateur radio stations communicated with amateur enthusiasts around the world from time to time. During the January 28th and August 13th battles, they provided Shanghai news to the world and were well-known.

(9) Telecommunications Education: Telecommunications education is the driving force behind the telecommunications industry. The earliest public telecommunications education institution in China was the Telegraph Training Institute of the Ministry of Posts and Communications. After the Republic, it was renamed the Telecommunications School, located at Wangjia Wharf in Nanshi. Unfortunately, it was closed in the 23rd year, with a history of more than fifty years. Most of the past telecommunications talents came from the school. Other notable institutions included the Wireless Radio Training Institute of the Construction Committee in the 18th year of the Republic, which also produced many talents. Among the private institutions, the earliest was the China Wireless Radio Engineering School, which was established in the 13th year of the Republic and registered with the Ministry of Communications. Over the past ten years, it has graduated thousands of students, who are now serving in public and private organizations in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and government. After the 18th year, there were private institutions such as Zhonghua, Jiaotong, Nanyang, Sanguo, and Jianhua, but they were all interrupted or closed down. Many people also came from these institutions, and their achievements were remarkable.

(10) Telecommunications Machinery: The machinery required for the telecommunications industry was initially purchased from foreign countries, which was very expensive. Later, the Ministry of Communications established a telegraph machine repair shop in Shanghai, and later the Postal and Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Plant. In the 17th year, the Construction Committee established a wireless radio mold manufacturing plant within Jiaotong University, which was later renamed the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant and located in Nanshi. Unfortunately, they were closed down one after another. In addition, there were private companies such as Dahua Scientific Instrument Company, Dahua Wireless Radio Company, Lida Company, and Asia Company. Over the past ten years, they have also produced a lot of products. Judging from the past situation of Shanghai's telecommunications machinery manufacturing industry, it is a very promising industry in the future.

The situation in Shanghai is special, and the telecommunications industry is therefore complex and difficult. In the past twenty years, it has gradually moved towards the right track. Unfortunately, after August 13th, it became chaotic and changed abnormally. This article only describes the situation before the war; and it does not mention the radio stations set up by foreigners and the navies and armies of various countries. Readers should pay attention to this.

### Overview of the Taxi Industry in Shanghai

— Pei Tang

Shanghai is the leading port in East Asia, with a dense population and thriving commerce, comparable to major cities worldwide. Not only do Chinese people gather here, but also Europeans and Americans come to reside for business. Because of the frequent interaction with Europeans and Americans, and living in close proximity, customs and habits have gradually become Westernized. The Western mode of transportation – the automobile – appeared at this time, and Shanghai began to establish a taxi industry. By the time the Republic of China was established, Shanghai's commerce had become even more prosperous, and the demand for transportation increased. Taxis emerged in response to the times, becoming one of the four essential elements supplying society. I, therefore, based on what I can recall, draft this article, "Overview of the Taxi Industry in Shanghai," to provide the public with some light reading after tea and wine.

The Founding Period: The existence of taxis in Shanghai actually began in the first year of the Republic (1911). The vehicles used at that time were all "covered carriages" (later called "carriages with hoods"). They had oil lamps in the front and rear and no bumpers. The water tank was covered with copper, in a rectangular shape. The handbrake was installed on the running board outside the car body. If it rained, there was no windshield wiper; only a little soap was applied to the windshield glass (insurance glass had not yet been invented) to prevent rain from sticking. Even the tires were very different from today's. The wheels were generally made of wood, and the rubber tires were smooth and without treads. The engine had to be started by hand. The car body was not as spacious and comfortable as it is today. As for small seats, handles, and other equipment inside the car, they were not worth mentioning. Everything felt simple and crude. From this, we can see the general situation of the vehicles at that time. The earliest operators were the Pingqia Men Automobile Company near Nanjing Road and Lloyd Road, and the Shimao Automobile Company near Nicheng Bridge, which can be said to be the pioneers of taxis in Shanghai. The fixed fare was five yuan for one hour and two yuan for half an hour. However, at the beginning of operations, there was little profit. Because the public did not recognize it as a convenient means of transportation, many people criticized it, considering it a gaudy luxury. Most people did not dare to ask about it. Only during holidays, some wealthy children and people in the entertainment industry would use it. However, most members of society still did not dare to try it. Around the second and third years of the Republic, the Feilong and Yitai Taxi Companies appeared. Afterwards, several companies such as Dongfang, Zhongyang, Feixing, and Yichang all operated taxis while selling cars. At that time, the price of gasoline was about eight or nine cents per gallon, and the most popular cars were Overland, Dodge, Ford, Studebaker, and other brands. However, the car rental was not uniform at the time. Some were calculated based on time (such as five yuan per hour, two yuan per half hour), while others were calculated based on the number of trips. For example, to Beixinjing, Longhua, Jiangwan, and other places, the car rental was no less than five silver dollars. Therefore, the failure of taxis to serve all sectors of society was mainly due to its high cost.

The Golden Age: In the eighth year of the Republic, the taxi industry suddenly boomed. Major car companies such as Yunfei, Huanqiu, Tanle, and Lili rose one after another, renewing the situation. Small car companies with only a few cars sprang up like bamboo shoots after rain. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of various sectors of society, major car companies added branch stations in residential and commercial areas and set up calling points in major companies, shops, and entertainment venues to expand business. The car rental also became unified, changing to three yuan per hour and one yuan per twenty minutes. The successful construction of roads around Shanghai and the expansion of the car companies' scope helped the development of the taxi industry. By this time, members of society had changed their past views and began to recognize taxis as the only convenient means of transportation.

Around the 16th year of the Republic, the municipal authorities, in view of the frequent traffic of taxis in the city and their close relationship with society, paid attention to it and specially formulated new regulations for management. For example, vehicles operating in the old city area were required to donate an additional vehicle license fee, and the vehicle licenses of all taxis were uniformly changed to white plates with black characters for identification. In order to eliminate the abuse of arbitrary substitution of vehicle licenses donated each time, a small photo was installed on the car door for prevention. The weight of the vehicle was also measured when each vehicle license was donated, to determine the amount of the vehicle donation. It was also ordered that each car be equipped with two horns with different sounds, to warn pedestrians for safety, and a rear-view mirror was added in front of the driver's seat to check for obstacles behind the car when reversing. All these measures were taken by the municipal authorities at the time to improve the vehicle operations of various car companies. At that time, due to social demand and the drop in gasoline prices to fifty-seven cents per gallon, the business of all car companies was booming. New car companies such as Yuegong, Nanfang, Xiangsheng, Huangqiche, and Huabei took the opportunity to establish themselves. This can be said to be the golden age of the taxi industry in Shanghai since its inception.

The Period of Decline: After the "January 28th" incident, the taxi industry fell sharply. Gasoline prices rose to about one yuan. Many of the smaller car companies could not maintain their operations due to heavy losses and closed down. Even the larger car companies showed signs of shaking. This can be said to be the period of decline of the taxi industry in Shanghai.

The Recent Period: In recent years, due to the consolidation of the legal tender system, all industries have gradually prospered, and the taxi industry has seen a revival. Yunfei, Xiangsheng, and Tailai are the largest and most well-organized car companies. In the 24th year of the Republic, the largest post-war car company, Silver Car Company, was established, making it the four major taxi companies in Shanghai. In recent years, the equipment and management of various car companies have been more thorough than in the past. To ensure customer safety, in addition to inspecting all vehicles every week, they also have car insurance to prevent accidents.

In the summer of the 26th year, a small taxi run by French businessmen appeared in the Second Special District of Shanghai, which initially charged car rentals based on the distance traveled. However, due to the failure to meet customer needs, it was voluntarily closed down soon after.

After "August 13th," traffic around Shanghai was cut off, and the routes were shortened considerably. Due to the high exchange rate, the price of gasoline soared to one yuan and four cents per gallon. The prices of tires and car parts also rose several times. The price of new cars also doubled, from about two or three thousand yuan each in the 14th and 15th years of the Republic to no less than six or seven thousand yuan now. For this reason, in order to maintain costs, various taxi companies unanimously agreed to raise prices by 20% on August 1st of the 27th year. Therefore, the current car rental has been set at one yuan and one cent per twenty minutes, and three yuan and six cents per hour.

### Chamberlain Dance

— Ge Er

Chamberlain is the Prime Minister of England, and the "Chamberlain Dance" is a kind of "dance art" that has recently become popular in the French dance scene. It is said that this "Chamberlain Dance" is as sensational as the "Lambeth Walk" currently popular in Shanghai's dance halls, and people are vying to imitate it.

The reason why the French dance scene has the "invention" of the "Chamberlain Dance" is because this Mr. Chamberlain, who is the Prime Minister of England, likes to carry an umbrella when he goes out, and he is also very fond of "world peace," so he is supported by the general public who "oppose war."

The "people" who "oppose war" mentioned above are completely different from the "opposition to war" of the people who hold parades and demonstrations in anti-fascist China, the United States, France, and other countries. The former's "opposition to war" is because it can maintain their life of "enjoyment and indulgence." "Dance halls" are of course one of the best places for them to "enjoy and indulge." Mr. Chamberlain's "love of peace" and maintaining "world peace" allow "war" not to "break out." The rich young men in the dance halls invented the "Chamberlain Dance" as a reward. This is truly the so-called "matter of course" and "unavoidable duty."

These are all "iron facts": Some time ago, after Head of State Hitler "reclaimed" Austria under a "referendum," he then used a set of "old formulas" to "reclaim" the Sudetenland. Miss France's eyes did emit a charmingly angry glow, as if she wanted to take off a dancing silk stocking and talk about a confrontation with Head of State Hitler. If it were not for the peace-loving Mr. Chamberlain "running around" and fulfilling the "great mission" of the "peace dove," then Miss France's "dancing silk stockings" would have already been taken off. However, wouldn't that make it impossible to "dance"?

Now, Head of State Hitler has even put Czech, which is not a Germanic race, under his "protection." Although the old Chamberlain loves "peace," "which is tolerable, and which is not tolerable?" Therefore, even the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a six-nation conference was considered "too slow to help" and "premature," and he did not agree with it. However, he thought that a widespread issuance of a "declaration" would be very "helpful." And today, even the "helpful" "declaration" does not need to be issued. Of course, according to the current situation, Head of State Hitler has already signed a "fair" "commercial agreement" with Romania. The "clouds of war" in Europe have "disappeared" again because Head of State Hitler has "known when to stop." Isn't the publication of the "declaration" "premature"?

"World peace" can be "maintained" again, and the "Chamberlain Dance" in the French dance scene should be danced even more "madly." This is enough to show a "peaceful atmosphere."

Now, I am introducing the "method" of the "Chamberlain Dance" below, providing a Macao for "dance friends" who "love peace": "After men and women start dancing in pairs, a male guest hangs an umbrella on his right arm. This male guest can choose any female guest he likes most from any pair dancing together, step forward to invite her to dance, and casually hook the umbrella on the right arm of the female guest's male partner. He can then dance wildly, regardless of whether the male partner is willing or not. However, the male guest who gets the umbrella can also act according to the law, so the cycle is endless, which is quite fortunate and interesting."

The "considerable interest" of the "Chamberlain Dance" is certain. Let us watch the popularity of this "Chamberlain Dance"! Of course, this requires closing your eyes and not looking at Head of State Hitler.

### New Trends at the Shanghai Drama Society

— Zong Yi

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Drama Society has only held three public performances, each separated by three or four months. There are many reasons for this. However, among these reasons, external factors are the most significant. For example, the difficulty in renting theaters is a major obstacle to the future of the spoken drama movement. Last year, we rushed to perform "Tears on Flowers" during the closing of the Carlton Theatre. There simply isn't a suitable venue in the Public Concession for us to perform. Although the French Municipal Council Hall can be borrowed, preferential rental rates are only given for French plays. For Chinese or Anglo-American plays, the full rent must be paid, and the limited seating makes performing there uneconomical. But should we stop performing altogether due to the lack of a venue? Of course not! We must strive to continue securing performance venues, and we will continue rehearsing major plays. Currently in preparation are "The Way to Make a Fortune" and "Motherland," both of which are French plays. If we can't find a suitable major theater, we can still perform at the French Municipal Council Hall. However, we cannot allow the Drama Society's work to be delayed by three or four months again. We must continue performing swiftly, so we have decided to do Sunday morning public performances. We have also decided on more than a dozen short plays to be rehearsed consecutively. We have signed a four-month contract with the Xinguang Grand Theatre, where we will meet with Shanghai's spoken drama enthusiasts every Sunday. This is the first significance of our Sunday short play performances.

Sunday short play performances have had a history of over a year in Shanghai. Audiences find it very economical and appropriate to use the short time on this holiday. However, the general criticism of previous short play performances has been that they were hastily done and the results were not very good. We want to promote and improve the standard of performance. We are very strict in selecting plays, and we are as careful in selecting actors and directors as we are for major plays. After you have seen the programs, directors, and actor allocations for our first two performances, you will understand the second significance of our short play performances.

Many new people are constantly joining the Drama Society. We would like to give them some training, but we cannot do so due to time and economic constraints. We have decided to use the Sunday short play performances as a training model for new people. For our first few performances, the roles of director and actors will be filled by the senior talents of our society, who will demonstrate on stage as teaching materials for the newcomers. Later, we will gradually select from the new people to enrich our cast of actors. This is the third significance of our Sunday short play performances.

### After Watching "Trade Winds"

— Ru Hua

"Trade Winds"

Produced by United Artists

"Trade Winds" is a comedy that combines romance and detective work, similar to Marlene Dietrich's "Desire." It depicts how a detective tracks a young, beautiful blonde woman who is a murderer. Because it is a comedy, of course, they "live happily ever after," and before the end, another murderer is found to make it "kill two birds with one stone." But after watching "Trade Winds," even with the lowest expectations, it falls short of "Desire." Indeed, "Desire" doesn't offer us much either. Here, the playwright reveals two shortcomings:

First, he tries his best to make the story lively. So, after the case occurs, he takes the blonde woman Kay (Joan Bennett), who is considered the murderer, from San Francisco to Honolulu, Osaka, Shanghai, Saigon, Singapore... and lets the detective Sam (Fredric March), who is ordered to catch her, follow her around in circles. This way of writing is lively, and it introduces the scenery of various places, giving the audience a novel feeling. However, the problem that arises at the same time is that many scenes become mere transitions, preventing the actors' emotions from developing uniformly.

Second, when introducing Sam, he is not a detective who uses love as bait for his professional duties, but rather a "master of flirting." So, it is possible for him to develop feelings for Kay. However, in the process between his request for a reward and his smugness after receiving it, he lacks a sense of being confident. This not only makes Sam's character somewhat erratic, but also makes the final solving of the case very abrupt. This may be the "deliberate mystification" of general detective films, but this "deliberate mystification" is "overreaching."

In terms of performance, Sam and Kay secretly get married in Bombay, and another detective comes to track them down. Kay is arrested. Here, the development of the play has reached its climax, and the final solving of the case is equally forced.

Director Tay Garnett is quite diligent. For example, when Sam is tracking Kay, the various scenes that represent local characteristics are connected very clearly. The arrangement of two comedic characters—Sam's female secretary Jean (Ann Sothern) and assistant Boloug (Ralph Bellamy)—is also very natural. Joan Bennett's acting has improved, and she is able to perform very movingly in many scenes. Fredric March has changed his previous style somewhat in "Smilin' Through," "There Goes My Heart," and this "Trade Winds." However, this change in style is not successful but rather a failure.

### China National Child Welfare Association

— Simon

Rescuing Countless Refugee Children During the War of Resistance

Not Only Sheltering Them But Also Educating Them

Children are the future masters of the country, especially China, which needs the talents of new people to shoulder the mission of post-war reconstruction work. Therefore, we should always pay attention to their health and not let their small lives be lost. Parents should be more careful in disciplining them. In our memory, regarding child welfare issues, there used to be a China National Child Welfare Association in Shanghai, which made considerable efforts in this regard, and many children received the benefits of the China National Child Welfare Association.

The China National Child Welfare Association's office, located at 131 Museum Road, was organized by Chinese and foreign individuals enthusiastic about child welfare issues. Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Executive Yuan, was the president of the association, and the vice presidents were Luo Yunyan and Mrs. Herman Krekeler. In addition, Mrs. Niu Huisheng, Ms. Wang Xiaoying, Li Ting'an, Li Denghui, Mrs. Franklin, Chen Heqin, Mrs. Yu Yongjian, Zhao Jinqing, Liu Wang Liming, and others were members of the China National Child Welfare Association. Such a charitable organization, with so many renowned figures supporting it, its development and benefiting children, can be imagined.

Before "August 13th," the China National Child Welfare Association had a wide range of activities: The Shanghai Child Welfare Training Institute on McCandless Road housed orphaned children without support and provided them with adequate education so that they could become independent and healthy citizens when they grew up. A children's hospital for the poor was established in Zhabei, where poor children could receive free medical treatment and medicine when they fell ill. To promote children's health, it organized children's health competitions every year in conjunction with various groups and health organizations. In terms of publications, there was a regular publication, the "Modern Parents" monthly magazine, which specialized in articles on parenting issues, instilling parental education so that general parents could pay attention to the importance of parenting and have sufficient new knowledge of parenting. There were many other tasks, but the author cannot remember them all at the moment and has to omit them.

After the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, due to the bombing by Japanese aircraft everywhere, countless innocent children in the war zone lost their homes and were separated from their parents. Even more refugee children were scattered among the refugees and fled to the concessions. Therefore, the work of the China National Child Welfare Association became even more urgent. A refugee children's shelter was set up in the St. John's YMCA Middle School on Jessfield Road, not only sheltering refugee children but also educating them. Many refugee children's schools were established, and doctors from the Zhabei Poor Children's Hospital took turns to treat sick children in various shelters. A refugee children's hospital was also established on Rue Molière. The established Poor Children's Training Institute was also evacuated from Zhabei to the concessions and continued to work in the Wangjia Sha Garden on Carter Road. With such a wide range of work and such intensive work during the war, considerable funding was naturally required. All the association's funding was donated by enthusiastic members. After the war left Shanghai, most of the work of the China National Child Welfare Association in the concessions continued. Not long ago, they even made a large number of winter clothes and distributed them to refugee children. Even though the environment is like this, they are still so enthusiastic about child welfare, which is worthy of our admiration. However, the China National Child Welfare Association's office has recently moved to Chongqing. Only a branch office is set up in Shanghai.

The work of the China National Child Welfare Association in this war is not limited to Shanghai. Wherever there is a war zone or an important rear area, the association sends personnel to work on the ground, rescuing general homeless refugee children. Branches have been established as far as Lanzhou, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and other places, actively engaging in child welfare work. The number of children in the war zone who were rescued by the association and thus avoided death is countless!

Chapter Six: Praising an Old Man with Three Outstanding Offspring, Narrating Friendship with Two Heroes Meeting Elites

Because most of the children in this nursery are fostered by others, it is rare to have some who have no parents and are not claimed. Some have mothers who have died, and fathers who have other occupations and cannot raise children, so they entrust them to this nursery. Some have fathers who have died, and mothers who need to seek employment and cannot raise children, so they also entrust them here. There are also parents who are still alive, but there are too many children in the family to raise, like Officer Fang's triplets, who have to be sent here. There are also those who have lost both parents, or whose parents have "disappeared," and another third party sends them here. There are all kinds of children in various forms. However, those fostered in the nursery should usually be paid, otherwise, with these more than 300 infants, the expenses last year were really considerable. Who would pay these expenses? Moreover, parents who give birth to children should be responsible for their upbringing, which is the same in any system of country. However, there is another kind of children who have no parents, or whose parents have, but cannot raise them, and the country or local area establishes a kind of public children's home. After the war, we China also established a lot of them, with various names: some are called orphanages, some are called refugee children's training homes. These institutions are probably established by a group of philanthropists who see that the children are pitiful and make public donations. Later, they were all changed to public children's homes, which are assigned by the state to be established locally. Regardless of who their parents are, or where they are from, if they are Chinese, they are a part of the Chinese nation. These public children's homes are not related to the nursery run by Dr. Zhang Wenqi in Anle Town and others. Because the nursery run by Dr. Zhang and others, although it cannot be said to be aristocratic, has better equipment and better treatment. It is not a charitable nature, it is not a public institution. Zhu Airen led the two of them to say, "Our first step is to go and see the kindergarten." Then they came to the kindergarten. There were about 60 people who were eligible to enter the kindergarten. They were divided into four groups, each group with sixteen or seventeen people, the oldest being six years old and the youngest being four years old. Like Dr. Ye Chuqing's two children, they are all in it, the little brother is six years old, and the little sister is four years old. However, by next year, the little brother will be of primary school age, and another way has to be found. The kindergarten is named as a country, but it is a garden, and there are some trees. These trees are all hung with a wooden sign, on which is written what tree was planted on what day of what month of what year, and it is clearly stated who planted it. It is said that a kindergarten student, when they are about to leave the kindergarten to enter primary school, must plant a tree as a souvenir.
