### German Attacks Repelled by Polish Forces; Intense Fighting 6 Miles Outside Warsaw; 70 German Planes Bomb Warsaw 15 Times in One Day; Large Polish Reinforcements Sent to Front Lines to Defend Both Rivers

London: The Polish Embassy here has just announced that Warsaw is still held by our troops (Havas dispatch, 11th).

Paris: The mayor of Warsaw telegraphed from the city today that fighting is taking place 6 miles outside Warsaw, that German attacks have been repelled, and that Polish morale is very high (Reuters dispatch, 11th).

Paris: According to reliable sources, the resistance of Polish troops on the Vistula and San River front lines has been strengthened, and a large number of reserves are available for reinforcement (Havas dispatch, 11th).

London: A communiqué issued last night from the Warsaw radio station by the Polish General Staff stated that the German forces approaching Warsaw have been repelled. According to various sources, Polish troops are desperately defending Warsaw, indicating that Warsaw is still completely under Polish control. German reports are not credible (Reuters dispatch, 11th).

Warsaw: Colonel Lipiński, Chief of Staff of the Warsaw Defense Command, broadcast a message at 10:30 PM tonight, stating that Warsaw was bombed by German planes no less than 15 times today, but a total of 16 German planes were shot down (Havas dispatch, 10th).

Paris: A reporter for a French newspaper claimed that Warsaw Garrison Commander Lipiński announced that Warsaw was bombed 14 times by 70 German planes on Sunday, and 15 of them were shot down by the Polish side (Reuters dispatch, 11th).

Hungarian Capital: According to Warsaw radio broadcasts, German troops shelled Warsaw all day yesterday and conducted 14 air raids. However, as of last night, Warsaw had not fallen. During the air raids, Polish anti-aircraft artillery shot down 15 German planes, five of which crashed within the city. Many houses in Warsaw were hit by incendiary bombs and caught fire. Polish troops 50 kilometers from Warsaw at Merymont are making every effort to resist the fierce German attacks. Two German tanks were destroyed by Polish forces. According to the latest reliable information from the Polish front, Polish defense forces have completed their planned defense lines on the Narew, Bug, and Vistula rivers, allowing Polish forces to form a long line of resistance in northeastern Poland (Associated Press dispatch, 11th).

Paris: According to news from here today, Polish troops are now concentrated along the Vistula River in the northern suburbs of Warsaw. Germans attempting to cross the river have been wiped out by Polish forces. It is also reported that there was terrible fighting all night last night in the northern suburbs of Warsaw, with Polish resistance being very successful. According to the Polish side, the German mechanized units' momentum has decreased compared to the past due to the lengthening of their rear transportation lines (Associated Press dispatch, 11th).

Beijing: This morning, Berlin radio broadcast a German war report stating that the great battle in Poland has reached a decisive point. Polish forces in the south are resisting German advances but have been forced by German forces to retreat across the San River. Recent news has confirmed that the two armies are now fighting 5 miles from Warsaw. According to Polish news received here, the German forces advancing northeast from Krakow have now stopped. The German forces in that area seem to be exhausted, and the morale of the Polish forces has not declined (Reuters dispatch, 11th).

Berlin: According to news from here today, the battle for Warsaw is now raging fiercely in the northeast and southwest of Warsaw. This battle could determine the overall situation of the war. The Bug River has become the last line of defense northeast of Warsaw, and German forces are currently building bridges over the river in preparation for crossing. The fighting between the Narew and Bug rivers is still extremely fierce, indicating that German forces have not yet gained a foothold there. To the southwest of Warsaw, a larger-scale battle is taking place in the area from the Łódź-Warsaw railway north to Sandomierz on the Vistula River. A German army advancing northwest has been out of contact for several days and is now reported to have reached 55 miles west of Warsaw, on the north bank of the Vistula River. It is reported that many Polish troops remain in the area it passed through, preventing it from advancing rapidly. The current German plan to attack Warsaw is to encircle it on three sides: one route advancing south from the Bug River, a second route advancing towards Warsaw from the northeast across the Vistula River, and a third route advancing towards Warsaw from the south. The German side views the war situation optimistically (Associated Press dispatch, 11th).

Paris: According to Polish sources here today, although Warsaw is now within range of German long-range artillery, German forces are still being held back in the suburbs. Although street fighting has begun there, German forces have repeatedly been repelled. In short, Warsaw has now become a fortress, similar to Madrid during the Spanish Civil War (Associated Press dispatch, 11th).

### Polish Troops Still Holding Gdynia Port; German Planes Continuously Bombing Transportation Lines; But Denies Dropping Incendiary Bombs on Warsaw

Berlin: The German military announced that the important Polish naval base of Gdynia is still under siege. The German navy is assisting the German army, shelling Polish artillery positions and bombing Gdynia port. The German air force continues to bomb the railways and highways east and northeast of Warsaw, as well as the railways and highways near Kulm and Lublin, with the aim of dispersing Polish troops moving along the routes. The western railway station in Kulm has been destroyed (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 11th).

Berlin: A communiqué was issued here last night stating that the "Swedish Evening News" published a report that the German air force dropped 200 incendiary bombs on Warsaw, but an investigation has proven this report to be completely false (Haitong dispatch, 11th).

### German-Polish Front Line 250 Miles Long

London: The German-Polish front line is 250 miles long, starting from Pozik on the Bug River, 30 miles north of Warsaw, reaching the outskirts of Warsaw, then from the outskirts of Warsaw to Łódź, then from Łódź to Sandomierz, and from there to Krakow. So far, Poland has lost one-third of its land. The greatest blow to Poland is the loss of the industrial area. The fall of Krakow gives the German army a base on the east bank of the Vistula River, while simultaneously thwarting the Polish army's plan to gain a foothold in this area, which is even more unfavorable. At the same time, the German army can advance northeast from here and attack the flanks of the Polish army. The fall of the industrial center of Łódź is another blow to Poland. According to reliable sources, Germany has mobilized 50 divisions, totaling 850,000 troops, for this campaign. Another 20 divisions have recently been added, so the number of German troops currently on the battlefield has reached 1.2 million (Associated Press dispatch, 11th).

### Germans Are Suffering; Still Unaware of the Opening of the Western Front

Danzig: A reporter for a certain newspaper stationed in Berlin cabled that the first German communiqué on the Western Front was broadcast nationwide yesterday, causing a great impression on the general public. Most Germans are completely unaware that war has broken out on the Western Front and still hope that conflict can be avoided on that front (Reuters dispatch, 11th).

### British and French Reporters Talk About the Situation in Poland

Cernăuți, Romanian Border: A Reuters special correspondent, after withdrawing from Warsaw, arrived at the Romanian border at night in a British Embassy car full of embassy staff. He gave a detailed account of the wartime situation in Poland. Most of the British evacuees were women. The journey from Warsaw to here took three and a half days, and air raid alerts were frequent along the way. The correspondent said that the speed of the German advance was unexpected. Although the Polish people are suffering, their morale has not been shattered, and they are proud that the Polish army is fighting against overwhelming odds. They are confident that the British and French armies will be victorious on the Western Front. The most disturbing aspect of the situation is the German advance from Slovakia, which threatens the Bug and Vistula River lines. However, the Polish command is confident that it can put up a long-term resistance there. The British and French ambassadors arrived at the temporary capital of Lublin, southeast of Warsaw, on Tuesday, but upon learning that the area was difficult to defend, they immediately packed up and headed to an area in the Pinsk region (Reuters dispatch, 11th).

Romanian Capital: A Havas correspondent stationed in Warsaw has arrived in Romania from Poland. He reported that one-third of the entire journey, namely the section from Warsaw to Lublin, had only one railway line, which had been heavily bombed by German planes. Major military locations were also frequently subjected to air raids. Consequently, traffic between Poland and Romania and Hungary has been affected and is extremely slow. In addition, numerous German planes bombed various Polish highways with small bombs continuously from 7:00 PM on the 5th of this month to noon on the 7th. As a result, the transport of wounded soldiers from the western front to Lviv in the east and the transport of troops and military equipment to Warsaw were greatly delayed. Polish authorities have sent a large number of workers to repair the damage in shifts, and they have been able to restore it quickly. In short, the German army's vehicles and equipment are superior, which is detrimental to Poland. Fortunately, the morale of the country is high, and it can continue to resist as before. As for the Western Front, residents of the German border area have been evacuated to Stuttgart and Frankfurt after the French army began its offensive. Polish citizens are extremely excited upon hearing this news. Although the country's communiqués admit to military setbacks, the public is not discouraged (Havas dispatch, 11th).

### Report of Warsaw's Fall Last Night Was a German Fabrication; Although It Is Difficult to Predict What Will Happen to the City, the Polish Army's Determination to Resist Has Been Clearly Demonstrated

Lviv, Southeastern Poland: The General Headquarters has just released a war report stating that German troops have retreated from the outskirts of Warsaw. The radio station there is still broadcasting as usual, but various German radio stations are impersonating the station's call sign and broadcasting false war reports. The so-called German occupation of Warsaw is one such fabrication. Listeners everywhere should pay attention (Havas dispatch, 11th).

London: The Ministry of Information released a message stating that anyone listening to foreign broadcasts may have heard an announcement in Polish on Friday night that Warsaw had been captured by German forces. This message was retransmitted yesterday by a radio station 15 miles outside Warsaw. Last night, the Polish Ambassador to the UK stated that although the German side claimed that German troops had entered Warsaw, they had not yet done so. This information was confirmed by a broadcast from the Polish government radio station in Warsaw itself. Fighting is currently intense, making it difficult to obtain accurate information about the German attack on Poland. However, several things are very clear: the Polish army is bravely resisting a superior enemy, the morale of the Polish soldiers is extremely high, and the retreat is orderly. Göring admitted in a broadcast yesterday that Germany had to mobilize 70 divisions of troops to invade Poland. Although the German army's manpower and weapons are far superior to those of the Polish army, the Polish army is still able to retreat in an orderly manner without panic. All observers should admire this. In this initial stage of the war, it is difficult to predict the fate of Warsaw, but the Polish army has displayed its courage and determination to resist, which is already a clear fact (Reuters dispatch, 11th).

### Britain Implements Restrictions on Trade with the Soviet Union; Soviet Union Considers It an Unfriendly Act

Moscow: Soviet newspapers have been repeatedly publishing news of unfriendly acts by Britain towards the Soviet Union. It is claimed that as of the end of August, Soviet commercial organizations in the UK have encountered many incidents detrimental to Anglo-Soviet commercial relations. For example, the British firm Henry Bley stopped manufacturing four pressing beds ordered by the Soviet Machine Import Bureau. The Azitier firm refused to ship ten machines that had already been manufactured to the Soviet Union, notifying the Soviet consignee that the British government had requisitioned the batch of machines. The Parkinson firm also refused to ship ordered machines to the Soviet Union, claiming that it was under orders from the British government. The Herbert firm not only refused to ship 27 machines that had already been inspected by the Soviet receiving representative but also refused to explain the reasons for breaching the contract. Churchill and Oakhad, two firms, unilaterally canceled contracts for three and fourteen machines, respectively, that had been ordered by Soviet import agencies. The Soviet Commercial Representation in the UK has collected a lot of evidence regarding this type of contract breach and bad faith by British firms and has repeatedly appealed to British government agencies, but to no avail. The British Board of Trade has also refused to issue export permits for 855 tons of rubber that has been paid for by the Soviet side and is waiting to be shipped at the docks, despite repeated requests. Furthermore, the Soviet commercial representative's request to transfer 1,000 tons of coffee beans purchased to the Soviet ship "Gransea" from a British ship has been fruitless for many days. The actions of the aforementioned British firms and British government agencies have fundamentally undermined Anglo-Soviet commercial relations (TASS dispatch, 10th).

### Britain and France Are Also Engaging in a War of Attrition Against Germany; Once the War Starts, It Cannot Be Stopped; German Illusions Are Gradually Disappearing

London: The British government announced last night that it has taken various measures to prepare for three years of war. Commentators here said that even if Poland is defeated, Germany should not expect a peaceful settlement. The British government's statement last night was intended to warn Germany of this and at the same time to ensure that world opinion does not expect German politics to collapse in the short term. In short, after the war against Germany begins, a long-term plan must be made to succeed. The British people are well aware that this war must be fought to the end, and therefore they can remain calm about the evolution of the situation. People in diplomatic circles say that the British government's statement yesterday was not intended to speculate about the future of the war. Its purpose was to prove Britain's determination to engage in a war of attrition and that it has taken all necessary measures to achieve final victory (Havas dispatch, 10th).

Paris: Diplomatic figures here have recently stated that the German side originally hoped that the current war could be localized. This illusion seems to be gradually disappearing. This can be seen from the fact that German radio stations only briefly mentioned the contact on the Western Front in their broadcasts today. General Göring, the country's Minister of Aviation, also delivered a speech to workers at a munitions factory in Berlin yesterday. His intention was to inform domestic workers that the scope of the war may expand and that its duration will be longer than expected. In fact, this situation has already been understood in various neutral countries. However, the so-called neutral countries are worth studying. The general public regards all countries that have not participated in the war as neutral countries. In fact, these countries can be divided into three categories. The neutral status of Switzerland and Belgium has been recognized by various countries in accordance with international law, which is the first category. Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Romania are bound by current treaties and are closer to certain countries than others. They are also avoiding involvement in the vortex, which is the second category. In addition, there are other countries that believe that their interests are not affected by the positions taken by the belligerent countries and therefore maintain neutrality, which is the third category. However, the attitude of this type of country is not based on fixed principles but on circumstances. Germany's claim that the war against Poland can be localized is probably alluding to this type of country (Havas dispatch, 10th).

### Soviet Union Feels Threatened; Makes Every Effort to Strengthen National Defense; Formally Announces Mobilization of Reserves

Moscow: Several grades of Soviet reserves have been ordered to mobilize in the military districts of the Ukrainian Republic, the Belarusian Republic, Leningrad, Moscow, Kalinin, and Orel. This has been formally announced by government authorities. In addition, all recruits of the 1919 grade, half of the recruits of the 1918 grade, young people of the 1920 and 1921 grades who have graduated from secondary school, and reserves of grades before 1918 who have obtained permission to defer service have all been ordered to enlist in the military immediately. Government authorities have also explained this military measure, stating that the scope of the war between Germany and Poland is expanding daily and the threat it contains is becoming increasingly critical. Therefore, the government has to take various measures to strengthen national defense. In various places, people have gathered in front of various shops, scrambling to buy white sugar, flour, kerosene, tobacco, and other items as a precaution. Some people also said, "Although we have made peace with the German leader Hitler, it is also possible that we may be forced to fight him one day." In short, according to foreign observers here, it is difficult to know what the true intentions of the Soviet authorities are. However, for the time being, it should be noted that the Soviet Union has not yet declared neutrality regarding the war between Germany and Poland. In addition, after Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany, the country's ambassador to the Soviet Union has not left and still enjoys diplomatic privileges. Although the authorities have denied recent rumors that the Soviet government no longer recognizes the ambassador, the ambassador's car no longer flew the Czech flag when he went out today, so the saying that the Czech state is no longer recognized is rife again (Havas dispatch, 1st).

Moscow: Moscow, which is generally regarded by observers as the safest capital in Europe, no longer presents a peaceful appearance. The number of spectators in theaters and cinemas is quite sparse, and there are fewer vehicles on the road than usual, as most vehicles have been requisitioned by the military commission. There are many people queuing quietly in front of various food stores and savings banks waiting to enter (Reuters dispatch, 11th).

### Former French Chief of Staff General Weygand to Go to Poland

Romanian Capital: Former French Chief of Staff General Weygand will arrive here from the Turkish capital in a few days. It is claimed that General Weygand is traveling through the Romanian capital to Poland (Haitong dispatch, 11th).

Editorial

### An Overview of the Sino-Japanese War Situation

As the European situation escalated from extreme tension to outright war, the world's attention has become focused on the European theater. As a result, the recent developments in the Sino-Japanese conflict have been overshadowed by the dramatic changes occurring internationally. However, they still cannot be ignored. Because China is an integral part of world politics, and China's resistance war can be regarded as the precursor to the worldwide "anti-aggression" war, we must not lose sight of this fundamental significance by focusing solely on the European situation. We can see that the British Foreign Secretary has solemnly declared that their Far East policy will not change, that both Japan and the Soviet Union deny having concluded a non-aggression pact, and that the United States is strengthening its defenses in the Far East. Furthermore, the Chongqing National Government has solemnly declared that its two-year-long, relentless policy of resistance will be maintained to the end. On the Japanese side, their new Prime Minister Abe has also stated, "Some people believe that the European war will provide Japan with an opportunity to easily resolve the China issue, but this is a great misconception." All of these developments indicate that the Sino-Japanese conflict has not diminished in importance due to the European war. Therefore, the development of the Sino-Japanese war situation should still be closely monitored.

Looking at the overall situation of the Sino-Japanese war, since mid-July, all fronts have been in a state of stalemate. The more significant engagements occurred in Shanxi Province, and the focus of the fighting in Shanxi is divided between western Shanxi and southeastern Shanxi. The fighting in western Shanxi has intensified since the beginning of this month, with Japanese troops retreating from the Fenyang-Xiaoyi line back towards the Lishi-Zhongyang line, and attacking Liulin, attempting to cross the Yellow River and advance into the Eighth Route Army's base area in Yan'an. According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 7th, Zhu De has personally gone to the front to command the battle. At the same time, tens of thousands of Chinese troops from Shaanxi Province have been crossing the river in successive days, indicating that another bloody battle is about to unfold. In southeastern Shanxi, the fighting remains stalled in the Changzhi, Changzi, Huguan, and Lucheng areas. Chinese troops are employing mobile warfare tactics, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese army. They are also taking advantage of heavy rains to operate with great agility, while the Japanese army is unable to deploy effectively. Cheng Qian, the director of the Northwest Headquarters, has flown to southern Shanxi to command 100,000 Chinese troops crossing the Yellow River from the southern bank, creating a formidable force. Overall, the current situation in Shanxi Province shows that the Japanese army is under triple pressure from weather, terrain, and manpower. While the pressure from terrain and manpower was within the Japanese army's calculations, the prevalence of natural disasters was unexpected. Recent heavy flooding in North China has turned the entire Hebei Province, as well as northern Henan and western Shandong, into a vast swamp. Heavy rains in southern Shanxi have also completely destroyed major transportation lines, causing difficulties for the Japanese army in terms of supplies, and substantial losses in terms of equipment and military stores. Since the Hongdong-Guluo highway was completely destroyed by the Chinese army, the only transportation line running through southeastern Shanxi is now entirely under Chinese control. Prolonged delays in this area could lead to the Japanese army being defeated piecemeal by the Chinese. According to a Reuters dispatch from northern Tianjin on the 10th, most of the Japanese troops in southern Shanxi have retreated and are heading towards the three northeastern provinces. This suggests that the Japanese army has abandoned southern Shanxi and is only seeking to maintain control of northern Shanxi and the railway between Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan. Having abandoned southern Shanxi, even if the Japanese army in western Shanxi were able to cross the Yellow River, they would not dare to venture deep inland alone. This shows that the war situation in Shanxi can be stabilized for the time being, and the Japanese attempt to overturn the Eighth Route Army's base area, as well as to cut off Sino-Soviet communications, has been proven to be a pipe dream by the facts.

In addition, in Guangdong, Chinese troops in the northeast of the two rivers have launched a counterattack, besieging Zengcheng and pressing on Conghua. Chao'an has been recaptured, and Jiangmen and Xinhui are under control. The activity of Chinese guerrillas in various areas such as southern Hebei, Jiaodong, northern Jiangsu, and southern Jiangsu proves the failure of the Japanese army's so-called mopping-up operations. The situation in northern Hubei is quiet. There are only localized skirmishes in southern Hubei, northern Henan, eastern Henan, eastern Fujian, and the South China Sea.

From a military point of view, each regional battle has its own mission, and no area can be neglected. However, from the perspective of a certain period and a certain stage, there is a distinction between the important and the less important. Currently, the most noteworthy center of attention is no longer western Shanxi, but central Hubei. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 8th, "According to military experts here, the Japanese seem to be planning a final decisive offensive in Hubei in September and October, in an attempt to end the war quickly. Their offensive route can be divided into two: first, along the Han River, through Xiangyang and Fancheng, to Lahekou, then westward to spy on Hanzhong, and then northward to reach Xi'an, while also threatening the highway communications to Chengdu. Second, to cross the Han River and spy on Jiangling and Yichang, controlling the navigation of the Yangtze River, while also subjecting Chongqing to continuous air raids by Japanese aircraft."

"According to reliable sources, the Japanese are currently preparing 50 gunboats for an attack on Shashi and Yichang... The army is also launching simultaneous offensives on land. The Japanese army in western Hubei has now increased by one division... and is also planning to transfer troops from Japan to China for reinforcement."

According to reports from colleagues, the Chinese army in central China has also been busy preparing for war for several days, with more than 300,000 fresh troops arriving on both banks of the Yangtze River. A major battle is brewing. It is worth remembering that in April of this year, the Japanese army also launched an offensive into central Hubei to spy on Sichuan and Shaanxi, but the result was a disastrous failure due to a light force advancing westward and its lines of communication being cut off by the Chinese army. This was the famous battle of the Dabie Mountains. Now, the target of Japan's so-called new offensive remains in this area, and the Chinese army is also recuperating and sharpening its swords, preparing for a fierce battle that is not far off. We will not make any judgments about the gains and losses at that time for now. We will try to speculate on the military strategy. If the Chinese army wants to defend western Henan and southern Shaanxi to the north, it must hold Xiangyang and Fancheng. If it wants to protect Hunan to the south and Sichuan to the west, it must also hold Jiangling and Yichang. Of the two, the gain or loss of Xiangyang and Fancheng is undoubtedly the most important. Because the Yangtze River has the danger of the Three Gorges, the Japanese army will certainly not dare to advance by water. It must first gain a foothold on the east bank of the Han River, so the area between Xiangyang and Fancheng is an important battlefield. As for Jiangling and Yichang, the Japanese army must have a strong force in Hunan to echo each other before attacking. However, the Japanese army in eastern Hunan has repeatedly suffered defeats, and is confined to a corner, only protecting Yueyang, and is really unable to do anything. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese army's strategy is still to attack Xiangyang and Fancheng as the main objective, and Jiangling and Yichang as the auxiliary. On the Chinese side, defenses have long been established step by step along the west bank of the Han River. If the Japanese army goes upstream, it will be extremely difficult to succeed. If it goes by road, although there are Xianghua to the east of Xiangyang, and Zhongxiang to the west, the Xianghua road passes through the central mountains, and the Chinese army can intercept and attack by relying on the terrain. The Zhongxiang road has the Han River separating it, and the Japanese army cannot easily fly across it. Furthermore, if you enter southern Shaanxi from Xiangyang to the west, the area west of Lahekou is all mountainous. Although there are several roads leading from Hanzhong to Sichuan, they are all steep mountain roads. The success or failure of a risky advance is really unknown. We will not say for the time being that China's opportunity to win a great victory is at hand, but China's possibility of winning a victory is indeed greater than that of Japan. To take a step back, if Japan attempts to end the Sino-Japanese war with this decisive new offensive, then Japan will inevitably be disappointed unless the Japanese army is defeated and returns in defeat. Japan must launch a hundred decisive new offensives, a hundred complete victories, before there is hope of ending the war. China only needs to prepare for one complete victory out of a hundred decisive battles to have a chance to clean up the situation!

### French Troops Pressing Closer to the Siegfried Line; Artillery Battles Becoming Fiercer; German Counterattacks Recapture One Position; French Still Have the Upper Hand in the Struggle for Strongholds

Paris - The Petit Parisien reports that over the past 24 hours, German troops have been fiercely resisting along the entire line to prevent the French advance. The Germans have recaptured one position previously taken by the French. There have been no changes to the French front lines. Enemy counterattacks have repeatedly failed to affect the French line. It is reported that German artillery has been retaliating heavily, indicating that French troops have penetrated the Siegfried Line. (Reuters, 11th)

Zurich, Switzerland - German radio announced in a broadcast at 5 PM today that French troops on the Western Front have made contact with German forces in front of the Siegfried Line. (Note: This is the first time the German side has admitted to contact.) (Havas, 10th)

Paris - The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 14 tonight, stating, "As a result of our army's steady and cautious advance, we have made progress in the Saar region and the Vosges Mountains. The enemy launched an offensive east of the Moselle River, northeast of the town of Sielck. Our aircraft continued reconnaissance flights today. The British and French navies laid mines in the English Channel and certain areas of the North Sea." (Havas, 10th)

Paris - The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 15, stating, "Last night was calm; our troops made local gains." Semi-official sources elaborated, stating, "Our army is gradually advancing on the western front in Germany. After reinforcing the forward troops, the enemy began a counterattack. The front line spans 50 kilometers, so the fighting there has become more intense than before. However, in two-thirds of the area, our army is still able to advance smoothly. In certain locations, progress is slower because the enemy is stubbornly defending. The struggle for positions that can be used as artillery emplacements is particularly fierce. Looking back on the achievements of the past few days of combat, our army has successively captured many hills, towns, and strategic strongholds. Therefore, our position is quite advantageous. The slogan adopted by our General Staff seems to be 'Safety First.' Therefore, every time a position is captured, it is first reinforced to ensure that the enemy cannot recapture it, thereby implementing a steady and cautious strategy." (Havas, 11th)

Berlin - French heavy artillery bombed the airfield in Saarbrücken. In reality, the German army had already withdrawn from the airfield. Three French aircraft that flew into German territory were shot down. (Haitong, 11th)

### Another British Ship Sunk by German Submarine; Merchant Ship Escort Measures to Be Implemented

London - The Ministry of Information announced that it has received wireless messages from various parts of the world reporting on actions against German submarines. Some of these actions have been successful. The Ministry of Information also announced that the British ship Magda Po, carrying 1,800 tons of military supplies, has been sunk. There were minor casualties. Other British ships that have been lost include the Rio Claro of the Thom Shipping Company, weighing 4,086 tons, sunk on September 6th, and the Hudu of the Whistle Company, weighing 5,000 tons, sunk on September 8th. (Reuters, 11th)

London - The Ministry of Information issued a statement saying that since the British Navy has taken various measures to deal with enemy submarines and mine-laying ships, the Navy has not yet announced what results have been achieved. However, it is well known that our warships are actively searching for enemy ships in all seas around the world, especially in the seas near Britain, to protect imperial shipping routes. The naval authorities will also implement merchant ship escort measures in the short term, at which time the sinking of our ships by the enemy can be eliminated. The reason why these measures could not be implemented immediately after the outbreak of the war is that our warships were originally scattered in various seas and could not be properly deployed in a short period of time. In short, in the past week, apart from the active operations of our destroyers and mine-laying ships, no large-scale naval battles have occurred. (Havas, 10th)

London - The Ministry of Information announced that the German ships Baldu (5,805 tons) and Vicissac (4,061 tons) have both run aground off the coast of Norway. (Reuters, 11th)

London - The British ship "Magdanburg" was sunk by a torpedo yesterday about five miles from the coast. At the time, thousands of bathers witnessed the scene. There were 90 sailors on board, all of whom were rescued by other ships and taken ashore in lifeboats. Many were injured. When the torpedo exploded, the houses on the shore were also shaken. (Havas, 11th)

### Germany Lacks Workers; Seeking Ways to Remedy the Situation

The Hague, Netherlands - According to German sources, Germany lacks workers. Remedial measures are being taken in Westphalia and the Ruhr region, namely: (1) canceling Sunday holidays without compensation, (2) canceling the bonus system and not providing additional compensation for overtime work, and (3) absolutely prohibiting wage increases. This is considered to be of great significance here. It can be seen that Germany's economy has already encountered difficulties. (Havas, 11th)

### French Finance Minister Announces Strengthening of the Economic Front; All Resources Must Be Mobilized; Economic Superiority Can Achieve Victory

Paris - Finance Minister Reynaud delivered a speech to the nation by radio tonight, saying, "The military front is of utmost importance, needless to say, but the economic, financial, and monetary fronts in the rear are also related to the survival of the nation, and are as important as the military. As for Germany, it has exhausted all its efforts to prepare for war for a long time, so it is exhausted. Its position in the economic and financial aspects is extremely fragile, and there are no 'fresh troops' to be transferred and replenished. Looking back at our country, the situation is far better than theirs. Since last year, our country's production has increased dramatically, and our gold reserves have increased by nearly 30% in recent months. The weight of gold stored in the Bank of France, measured in tons, is double that of 1914, and this does not include the gold held by the Exchange Equalization Fund or the foreign currency held by the people. To shorten the period of killing the enemy and achieving results, and to reduce the sacrifice of national lives, it all depends on this gold." Also, in 1914, the amount of payment from each bank and savings bank was limited to 50 francs per person every half a month, but now there is no limit, regardless of the amount. For this reason, there was no rush to withdraw deposits in the first week of the outbreak of the war, and the people's subscription to national defense bonds reached as much as 16 billion francs in an instant. In short, during this war, economic and financial warfare plans are extremely important. All resources must be mobilized to ensure that the domestic economy maintains at least the minimum level of functional activity. If it is necessary to adopt a strategy of attrition in the future, then the more production is sought, the less consumption is sought, the more likely we are to last. We need to manufacture airplanes, cannons, and ammunition now, but we should also produce food, manufacture clothing, and maximize exports to preserve gold reserves. As for all consumption, it should be cut to the minimum amount. The goods purchased from abroad should be reduced, and various items that are not essential should not be imported. Anything that facilitates the enemy should not be allowed to be exported. In the European War, there will be those who make shocking profits from the war, and this will never be allowed to happen. People who have not set out to fight in the war have greatly increased their donations and taxes, and exchange management measures have also begun to be implemented. In short, in 1918, the Allied countries won because of their greater war potential, and this advantage still exists, and may even be greater than before. Therefore, our victory is as sure as capturing something with our left hand." (Havas, 10th)

### Roosevelt to Call Congress This Week to Discuss Amending the Neutrality Act; Strongly Advocates Repealing the Arms Embargo Clause

Declares Strict Neutrality Towards Canada

Hyde Park - Authoritative sources stated today that President Roosevelt will call a special session of Congress at the end of this week to amend the Neutrality Act. It is predicted that the regular session of Congress will be held on October 2nd. It is widely believed that this delay is due to fear that stubborn isolationists in Congress will oppose amending the Neutrality Act. The administration will do its best to ensure that things proceed smoothly. If necessary, it may use the cloture rule, which has only been used two or three times in American history. (Associated Press, 11th)

Washington - President Roosevelt, who is vacationing at his estate in Hyde Park, issued a declaration immediately after learning that the Canadian Confederation had declared war on Germany. The declaration is divided into three parts: (1) The United States maintains strict neutrality towards Canada, (2) the Neutrality Act should be immediately extended to Canada, and (3) arms shipments to Canada are prohibited. (Havas, 10th)

New York - President Roosevelt has boarded a special train from his estate in Hyde Park and is returning to Washington. (Havas, 10th)

Hyde Park, USA - According to reliable sources, President Roosevelt will call Congress into a special session within this week to amend the current Neutrality Act, but the date of the meeting has not yet been decided, and may be in early October. The government hopes that the discussion will be limited to amending the Neutrality Act, and pay special attention to the repeal of the arms embargo treaty. Although President Roosevelt has not expressed his opinion on this point, he is concerned that the discussions will be complex after Congress reconvenes, because those members who advocate repealing the arms embargo clause will make the people of Britain, France, and Poland think that the United States is sympathetic to them, while those who oppose the repeal will make Germany think that it is beneficial, which is contrary to the purpose of neutrality. The President is therefore hesitant, but because the situation is such that Congress cannot be delayed any longer, he resolutely called it as soon as possible. (Havas, 10th)

### Britain Declares War on Germany to the League of Nations

London - The Ministry of Information issued a statement saying that Foreign Secretary Halifax has ordered Judge Jebb Kugg to send a letter to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, stating: "Our Foreign Secretary, on behalf of the British government, made a speech at the Executive Council of the League of Nations on May 23 of this year, explaining the various obligations that our country has accepted to maintain peace, and said that these obligations are based on a common principle, that is, the method of using force to force others to accept certain demands must be resisted, because if this method is used continuously, human civilization will inevitably tend to destruction and constitute a state of anarchy. In Britain, all actions are based on conforming to the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant. However, the German government suddenly took aggressive actions against one of the member states of the League of Nations, namely Poland, on the 1st of this month. This not only violates the various obligations contained in the 1928 Paris Peace Pact, but also violates the obligations that Germany had previously accepted towards Poland, that is, the obligation not to use force to resolve disputes between Germany and Poland, and even disregards the peace appeals made by all parties. The British government, together with the French government, made a final effort to ensure that peaceful negotiations could be conducted between Germany and Poland. After the German army invaded Polish territory, it made every effort to urge Germany to withdraw its troops from Poland through diplomatic channels. However, all these efforts failed. Therefore, the British government had no choice but to implement the obligations it had accepted towards Poland. These obligations first appeared in the declaration issued by the British government on March 31 of this year, and were later detailed in the mutual assistance agreement signed between Britain and Poland on August 25 of this year. Since Germany has continued to take aggressive actions against Poland, the British government, in accordance with the above-mentioned obligations, declared war on Germany on the 3rd of this month. We hereby report this to you, hoping that you will take note of it and forward it to the governments of all member states. (Havas, 10th)

Basel, Switzerland - The Basler Nachrichten recently published a message from Berlin stating that several German aircraft had flown over Warsaw during the day and dropped leaflets, advising the Polish people not to participate in defense work, because Warsaw had become a fortified position and, once the German army occupied it, the city would be subject to martial law for residents participating in defense.

### Canada Formally Declares War on Germany; Canada's First Declaration of War

Ottawa - Canada has now declared war on Germany. According to the announcement in the gazette, Canada has been in a state of war with Germany since September 10th. The declaration of war has been telegraphed to London, requesting that the King of England sign it in the name of the King of Canada. This is Canada's first declaration of war, because in 1914 Canada only announced in the gazette that Britain had declared war on Germany. (Reuters, 11th)

Ottawa, Canadian Confederation - The Federal Government held a cabinet meeting this morning, and immediately drafted a declaration of war on Germany, which was signed by Justice Minister Lapointe, Prime Minister Mackenzie King, and Governor General Lord Tweedsmuir. The content stated, "The Federal Government of Canada hereby declares that a state of war has existed with Germany since September 10." This declaration has been telegraphed to London, requesting approval from King George VI to complete the procedure.

Prime Minister Mackenzie King will explain the impact of this matter to Congress. (Havas, 10th)

### Japan Attempts to Ease Conflict with Soviet Union; Umezu Appointed Ambassador to "Manchukuo"; Abe Denies Negotiations with Soviet Union

Tokyo - Japan is now trying to end the large-scale border disputes with the Soviet Union and plans to demarcate some border areas as demilitarized zones. It is said that there may be even broader adjustment measures. However, insiders say that there are too many pending cases between Japan and the Soviet Union, and it is too early to say that there is a possibility of concluding a non-aggression treaty. However, there are already clues to be found. In the past, the Japanese Ambassador to "Manchukuo" was concurrently held by Ueda, Commander of the Kwantung Army. Recently, Lieutenant General Umezu has been appointed to the ambassadorial post. Umezu believes that Japan, at the current stage of the war against China, must not waste its military power and engage in conflict with the Soviet Union, so he advocates resolving the border conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union as soon as possible. According to reliable sources, the appointment of Umezu as the Japanese Ambassador to "Manchukuo" was personally decided by the Japanese Emperor to ease the serious situation on the border of "Manchukuo." At the same time, the Japanese Foreign Ministry also instructed the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, to seek diplomatic means with the Soviet side to resolve the Nomonhan incident. If the Nomonhan case is resolved, other pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, such as fishing rights, oil and coal rights in Sakhalin, Soviet aid to China, and border disputes, will all be discussed one by one. Note that Umezu is the person who concluded the He-Umezu Agreement with He Yingqin in 1934. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

Tokyo - According to Japanese officials today, German news claimed that Japanese Prime Minister Abe had complied with the request of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to adjust relations with the Soviet Union and negotiate a non-aggression treaty. This statement is completely inaccurate. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

Tokyo - Political circles here firmly deny the rumors that Japan has changed its attitude toward the Soviet Union. This news came from Berlin, stating that when Prime Minister Abe outlined the essentials of Japanese foreign policy last Saturday, he stated that the Japanese government is now revising the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union based on the advice of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In addition, the news from the German side that the Japanese Prime Minister advocated the conclusion of a Japanese-Soviet non-aggression treaty was also denied by political circles here, and it was firmly stated that the Prime Minister believed that Japan had joined the Anti-Comintern Pact and at the same time concluded a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. This is actually self-contradictory. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

### Japan Hopes to Renegotiate Commercial Treaty with the United States; The Only Condition for the United States is Still the Open Door Policy

Washington - According to observations from diplomatic circles here, Japan's neutrality in the European war is aimed at obtaining great commercial benefits. It is expected that it will soon negotiate a new commercial treaty with the United States, because the goods that Japan previously imported from Germany, Britain, and France will now all rely on the United States. At the same time, Japan's imports from South American countries have increased compared to before, and Japan's exports to South American countries have also slightly improved. It is expected that Japan will soon discuss the conclusion of a new commercial treaty with the United States. However, the US position is the open door policy and equal opportunity in China. If Japan still attempts to monopolize and exclusively occupy China, then a new commercial treaty will not be possible. Therefore, the key to negotiations must be to stop the war against China and to remove the various restrictions set up by Japan that squeeze out foreign trade. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

### Hitler Rejects Flower Offerings from the Public

### Indian Viceroy Reads the Royal Decree of the British King

Shimla, India - The decree to the Indian people from King George VI of England was recently presented and read in Parliament by the Indian Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow. The content is to commend India, from the princes to the people, for their voluntary expression of loyalty, stating: "At this time when our nation is engaged in war, I firmly believe that all Indian subjects will be able to give the British government sympathy and assistance to overcome the common crisis, because Britain is fighting not for its own purposes, but for the vital principles of mankind's future. According to these principles, civilized countries should relate to each other on the basis of reason and law, and not rely on force, so that human life will not always be threatened by the horrors of war, and can enjoy the benefits of life." After reading the decree, Viceroy Linlithgow gave a speech stating that he firmly believed that the Indian army would maintain its glorious traditional spirit and that all subjects of the country would be able to fulfill their responsibilities and live up to their duties. According to the report submitted by Lord Chatfield, the British Minister for Defense Coordination, the Indian army has been modernized and is no different from the armies of the major industrial countries in the world. This progress is a gift from the British government and should not be forgotten. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Turkish Foreign Minister to Return Visit to Soviet Union

Istanbul - The news that the Turkish Foreign Minister plans to return visit Moscow has aroused great interest among the general public. It is predicted that the Turkish government will sign a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. It is rumored that the Turkish Foreign Minister's visit to the Soviet Union is in response to the Soviet Foreign Minister Potemkin's invitation to Turkey in April this year. It is still remembered that when Potemkin was in the Turkish capital, he notified the Turkish government that the Soviet Union did not approve of extending British rights to the Dardanelles Strait and the Black Sea. Diplomatic circles say that the Soviet government has recently hinted to Turkey that the Soviet Union still maintains the same attitude towards the Straits and Britain as it did this spring, and hopes that Turkey will be the protector of the Straits and will not allow other countries to covet it. (Haitong dispatch, 11th)

Bucharest, Romania - 200,000 Romanian reserve soldiers were conscripted last Saturday, so the country's active military personnel total 750,000. This decision by Romania to conscript soldiers came just as General Goering of Germany warned Romania and Yugoslavia in a broadcast speech that if either Hungary or Bulgaria attempts to recover lost territory after the war, Romania will inevitably be drawn into the whirlpool of the European war. The Balkan countries are currently holding talks in the capital of Yugoslavia. If the outcome can implement neutrality, then Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will definitely support it. In addition, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky recently traveled to Germany, and people here are quite suspicious of this, because the German government authorities may support Hungary's claim to recover lost territory. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

### Japanese Army Unable to Advance; Chen Cheng's Remarks

He also said that "the Sino-Japanese War is part of the world's anti-aggression war, and I believe that the United States' policy is not to help aggressors," "so in the future, for aggressor countries such as Japan, it will definitely cut off their supply of military raw materials." He also said that "the current anti-aggression war in Europe is completely the same as China, so this war in Europe is enough to enhance the morale of the Chinese army and the spirit of the people, but we only have one enemy, which is Japan. The British and French will definitely know this." (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

As for his crimes, they are embezzlement of anti-British propaganda expenses and theft of rural revitalization funds. Currently, the Japanese authorities here are starting to investigate in order to determine the total amount of embezzled public funds. (According to the Shinmin-kai, 500,000 Japanese yen are allocated monthly, specifically for rural revitalization and public welfare undertakings). First, the Japanese military officers in North China deeply felt that the association's achievements were not good and seemed to be suspected of engaging in private fraud, so they began to investigate. After reviewing the account books, they arrested the Japanese Kusaizumi and other department ministers. It is heard that, as of now, only Kusaizumi is the only Japanese person who has been arrested. The Japanese side will investigate the branch offices in various places separately, so there may be more members imprisoned in the future. After Kusaizumi was arrested, his Chinese colleagues were imprisoned one after another, and the leaders in various places in North China also applied to resign at the same time. In addition, the Japanese authorities here have also conducted a strict investigation on the major Chinese newspapers, because some people pointed out that the newspapers purchased large quantities of grain with the flood relief funds raised and then resold them to the refugees and collected huge profits (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

### United States Stops Supplying Airplanes to Britain and France

New York - After the news of the Canadian government's declaration of war against Germany reached here, the U.S. government has decided to apply the Neutrality Act to that country, prohibiting the transportation of military supplies to Canada. Airplane orders placed with the United States by Britain, France, and Australia will no longer be shipped through Canada. It is estimated that the United States currently has more than 700 foreign military aircraft orders under construction, and all exports will be completely prohibited. According to the "Christian Science Monitor," the Martin Aircraft Factory has 215 French orders, but the factory has only delivered one order before the implementation of the arms embargo.

### German Newspaper Comments on British Policy

Berlin - Regarding the British Cabinet's declaration that it will implement a three-year war plan, people here generally regard it as representing Britain's true intentions. It is said that Germany knew before the outbreak of the German-Polish war that Britain intended to defeat the new Germany. Judging from Britain's recent appointment of a Minister of Economic Warfare, it can be seen that Britain has been planning to economically suppress Germany for two years. From this perspective, the original intention of Britain's peace policy is self-evident. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" commented on the British Cabinet's declaration to prepare for a three-year war, saying that the British Cabinet's declaration has been answered by General Goering. General Goering's speech the other day stated, "Germany has already considered the possibility that this decisive battle may become a long-term war, so Germany has long been prepared in terms of materials. Even if three years cannot resolve it, it will not stop until final victory is achieved." (Eleventh Hai Tong dispatch)

In doing so, they will promote the bond of unity between France and Poland. We have unwavering faith in the strength of the French nation and its heroic and faithful spirit. From now on, our country's soldiers participating in combat in France must serve the motherland based on this trust. It must be known that the war threatening the civilized world has just begun.

### Sino-Japanese War Enters Third Year: American Opinions; Survey by American Institute of Public Opinion; Majority Supports Taking Active Measures to Protect American Interests in China

Dr. Gallup, Director of the American Institute of Public Opinion, recently published the Institute's survey on American opinions as the Sino-Japanese War enters its third year. The majority supports taking active measures to protect American interests in China. In the survey, only one-quarter of voters believed that the U.S. government should "take no action" toward China. The remaining three-quarters supported three specific courses of action. The first, a small number, believed that the United States should go to war with Japan. The second, a larger number, would be satisfied as long as the State Department protested to the Japanese government when American interests in China seemed to be hindered. The third, the largest group, believed that the appropriate course of action was to stop all shipments of American military equipment and war materials to the Japanese army.

This survey was conducted among a cross-section of voters in various U.S. states. The question was, to what extent should the U.S. government protect American interests in China? Voters chose from four policies that the U.S. government could follow: (1) Go to war with Japan, (2) Protest to Japan through the State Department, (3) Stop all U.S. shipments of war materials to Japan, (4) Take no action. The results were as follows: 6% supported war, 18% supported protests, 51% supported stopping shipments, and 25% supported taking no action.

The British Institute of Public Opinion, affiliated with the American Institute of Public Opinion, conducted a similar survey in Britain and found that British voters were more eager to take decisive action in China than American voters. More than one-fifth of British voters believed that Britain should go to war with Japan if necessary. The remainder supported ending all trade between Britain and Japan, or providing credit loans and military supplies to China, or recalling the British ambassador to Japan as a protest. Only a small group (15%) believed that Britain should "take no action."

The survey conducted in Britain differed slightly in wording. The results were: 22% supported war, 37% supported stopping all trade with Japan, 17% supported supplying China with military equipment, 9% supported recalling the British ambassador as a protest, and 15% supported taking no action. The survey results have significant implications in two respects. According to news from China, the Japanese army has launched an anti-British movement to incite anti-British sentiment among the Japanese, but has never organized an anti-American movement. However, the Institute of Public Opinion's survey shows that Americans' feelings toward Japan are no more friendly than the British. The U.S. survey is also significant when compared to the sentiment in the United States two years ago when the Sino-Japanese War began. At that time, the Institute of Public Opinion's survey found that many Americans supported a hands-off, "no action" policy, as well as withdrawing American citizens and interests from China. Most people also opposed implementing an embargo against Japan. However, today's opinions have shifted toward hoping for action.

The U.S. survey reveals some interesting regional differences in opinion. The Far West, including the Rocky Mountains or the Pacific coast, is most in favor of taking action to protect American interests in China. The Far West had fewer voters supporting "no action" than any other part of the United States, perhaps because the region is geographically closest to Japan and most affected by events in the Pacific. The survey results for each region are as follows:

Voters in the American survey explained their attitudes toward Japan, citing a wide variety of reasons for supporting action. Those who supported the most extreme course of action, war with Japan, stated that the United States would eventually fight Japan anyway, and that we should help "contain the rogue nation." Those who supported an embargo on war materials to Japan could be represented by the opinion of a housewife from Troy, New York, who said, "If we don't want war, then why supply war materials?"

### Key Japanese Figures in Xiamen: Mito Haruzo and Sawa Shigenobu; Naval Faction Overpowers Xiamen Faction; Xiamen Communications Ultimately Fail

Xiamen Communication: The key Japanese figures in Xiamen were originally Consul Yamada, Naval Commander Miyata Yoshiichi, and Special Agency Chief Lieutenant Colonel Sawa River. This spring, the "Asia Development Board" was established, with liaison offices in four locations: Peiping, Zhangjiakou, Shanghai, and Xiamen. Rear Admiral Mito Haruzo of the Japanese Navy was ordered by the Board to come to Xiamen with the responsibility of being in charge of the political offensive in South China. As a result, the Japanese naval faction in Xiamen gained the support of Mito, and their arrogance greatly increased. For example, the Japanese military had already handed over the authority for the invasion of Fujian to the army. After Mito's arrival in Xiamen, it was changed to naval control. Currently, although the army faction constantly thinks of revenge, Mito is a very popular figure among the key Japanese figures in Xiamen. His background is as follows, according to Japanese publications:

"Mito Haruzo, from Hiroshima Prefecture, graduated from the Naval Academy in 1908. He has served as Chief of Staff of the Mako Naval Base, Captain of the Kako and Haruna cruisers, Chief of Staff of the Second Fleet, Commander of the Kure Guard District, Commander of the Mako Naval Base, and has been serving in the Military Command Headquarters since the autumn of the year before last." Why is the "Asia Development Board Liaison Office" not located in Guangzhou but in Xiamen? Why must Mito Haruzo be appointed as the director? There is a great deal of significance in this. According to Sho Ogata's "Asia Development Board Liaison Office and Japanese Officials," "Because Xiamen is across from Taiwan, this newly established liaison office is different from the other three liaison offices. Rather than saying that it is dealing with the Chinese, it is better to say that it is an extension of Taiwan (note). Therefore, the director of the Xiamen Liaison Office is Rear Admiral Mito Haruzo, who has held important positions in the military command system. It should be noted that the person helping him is Colonel Hara Chūichi, Director of the Naval Special Agency." The purpose of establishing the Xiamen Liaison Office of the "Asia Development Board" is to serve as an extension of Taiwan. To put it bluntly, it is to use Xiamen as a starting point to turn all the provinces of South China into Taiwan, into a colony in its pocket. Can Mito take on this responsibility for the Japanese side's intentions? This is a big question. What achievements have the Japanese made in the two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, the target of the South China invasion, over the past two years? Has the establishment of the Liaison Office brought any new achievements or gains? The facts speak for themselves. In Guangdong, the Japanese army can only be confined to the Zhou area of Guangzhou. After capturing Chaozhou and Shantou, they have not been able to cross the Lei Pool one step. What about Fujian? After the fall of Kinmen and Xiamen, the Japanese have made no progress in the past year. Recently, the mad blockade of the seaports can only harass undefended islands. As for the political offensive, the scope of activity of Japanese spies and traitors has gradually shrunk. The Xiamen Liaison Office, presided over by Mito, has indeed worked hard in this regard, training a group of young people, women, children, and monks. Facts have proven that this is just a waste of time, money, and effort. The spies he trained have not achieved even one percent of the effect he hoped for. Although Mito is experienced and ruthless, and the Japanese side has placed unlimited hopes on him, he is also powerless and cannot achieve anything. The only achievement is to overwhelm the army faction in the internal strife and give the naval faction entrenched in Xiamen a chance to raise its head (to be continued).

### Anti-Japanese War Effects in Northern Jiangsu: Xuzhou Counties Are Best; 50 Battles Large and Small in Three Months; Total Japanese Casualties Estimated at Over 1,000

Taixian Communication: According to a recent investigation, the anti-Japanese war results in the occupied areas of Jiangsu Province are best in the counties of Xuzhou. It is estimated that they have long held down the strength of a Japanese division, occupying 62 key transportation points. In the past three months, the guerrillas in various counties have engaged the Japanese army in more than 50 battles, including more than ten positional battles, and five or six attacks on large-scale Japanese mopping-up operations. In total, the Japanese side has suffered more than 1,000 casualties. The guerrillas have destroyed more than 20 sections of the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways and highways, destroyed five Japanese trains, and removed more than 70 li of telegraph poles and wires. Now that the autumn crops are gradually losing their cover, the counties are transforming the transportation ditches dug along the highways to change the terrain and obstruct Japanese military action.

### Specialized Schools Above the Secondary Level in the Interior Restrict Construction of School Buildings: Regulations Suitable for the Period of the War of Resistance

(Chongqing News) The Ministry of Education believes that in the past, the construction of school buildings for specialized schools above the secondary level cost a great deal, and the principles of solidity, practicality, safety, economy, simplicity, and beauty were not fully met. Now, during the period of the War of Resistance, schools along the coast have successively relocated to the interior. These newly relocated schools, and the schools originally established in the interior, have insufficient school buildings and often economize on funds or apply for appropriations to request additional school buildings. The Ministry of Education has specially formulated temporary regulations for the construction of school buildings for specialized schools above the secondary level. From the 27th academic year onwards, all specialized schools above the secondary level in the country must follow the regulations if they need to build or add school buildings. The general procedures are that during the War of Resistance, public and private specialized schools above the secondary level shall not construct or add school buildings unless there is a special need and one of the following four conditions is met: (1) Schools in war zones relocate and start classes, and there are no public or private places available for rent, or the rented houses are insufficient; (2) Schools relocating and starting classes have plans to establish themselves permanently in the relocated location; (3) Schools located in non-war zones have admitted a large number of students from war zones, causing the original school buildings to exceed their maximum capacity and are indeed unable to accommodate them; (4) Newly established schools have no suitable school buildings available for rent. School building construction is divided into three categories: teaching buildings, administrative buildings, and staff and student dormitories. The area of each type of building and the distribution of construction costs are as follows: (Category) Teaching Buildings, (Buildings) Classrooms, laboratories, libraries, science halls, gymnasiums, auditoriums, etc., (Percentage of Building Area) 30-40, (Percentage of Construction Costs) 40-60, Administrative Buildings, Offices, medical rooms, etc., (Percentage of Building Area) 5-10, (Percentage of Construction Costs) 5-10, Staff and Student Dormitories, Staff Dormitories, Student Dormitories, dining halls, washrooms, toilets, etc., (Percentage of Building Area) 40-60, (Percentage of Construction Costs) 30-40. Among all staff and student dormitories, the building area and construction costs of staff dormitories shall not exceed one-sixth of the total number of student dormitories.

### School News

Sanwu University: Sanwu University on Renji Road held an opening ceremony and the first graduation ceremony of the Special Law Department on the 10th. More than 200 people attended. First, Director-General Wang Fengnian reported on the events of the past year, followed by exhortations from Provost Xu Chongqin, Dean of the Law School Shan Yuhua, and various professors. The main idea was to encourage the graduating students to continue their research and work hard. The words were very cautionary and earnest. Then, Dean Shan of the Law School issued graduation certificates, and Xu Weigong gave a speech in English. After the meeting, Professor Fang Junjie hosted a public banquet for the staff and graduating students.

Junyi Middle School: Junyi Middle School in this city, the first section of the senior and junior high school departments on the fifth floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, and the second section of the junior high school department on the fifth floor of the Pudong Tongxiang Association on Foch Road, will recruit two to five free students per class within one week from now, limited to poor students, to relieve poor and out-of-school youth. The referrer for the free person must be a faculty member of the school, a graduate of the senior or junior high school, or someone who is directly acquainted with the director of the school. The registration procedures are the same as for ordinary students. The number of places is limited and will not be advertised separately.

National Studies Training Class: The Dacheng Society and the Datong Music Society in this city both have considerable history. In view of the lack of popularity of national studies and national music, a National Studies Training Class has been established at 36 Songshan Road, with the aim of promoting national essence and cultivating basic talent. The courses include basic Chinese, applied writing, poetry, Kunqu Opera, and music. Anyone with a junior high school education or above, with pure thoughts, and excellent character and learning, can register for the entrance exam. At the initial opening of the class, only 30 students will be admitted. Tuition is low, and poor children can apply for free admission. Classes will begin on the 18th.

### Male and Female Volleyball League Championship Finals: Fang Gang Defeats Fudan Again; Women's Ever-Victorious Youxing Suffers a Crushing Defeat; Fudan's Lu Duoyun Single-Handedly Contributes

The four major male and female volleyball teams in Shanghai met last night at the Zhongqing Fitness Center. In the women's match, Fudan played Youxing, and in the men's match, Fang Gang played Fudan. The Fudan women's team was the champion of the Zhongqing League's Ordinary Group, while Youxing was the champion team of the Hongyi Cup women's group. Fang Gang and Fudan each won one final in the Zhongqing and Hongyi Cups. Last night was nothing less than another overall final, so the battle was extremely tense. A large audience filled Zhongqing, and the performance was extremely exciting. As a result, the Fudan women's team defeated Youxing 2-0, winning two consecutive games, while the Fang Gang men's team fought fiercely for four games, and in a difficult and indistinguishable situation, finally won against Fu Dan. The scores are as follows:

Fudan Women: Lu Duoyun, Tan Taiwei, Wang Qian, Chen Liuzhen, Zhang Ningzhu, Chen Wanruo, Chen Jieshu, Xiao Huilan, Wang Guangmei,

Youxing Women: Zhu Peiqing, Zhang Jiapei, Zhu Shiqin, Zhang Xiangping, Huang Xingfen, Shi Ruijuan, Xu Yuqi, Shao Tao, Cheng Hongsheng,

Fudan Men: Li Weifan, Zhou Shuyun, Tan Yongzhan, Liang Yunming, Yu Buzi, Yuan Zejian, Jin Yuanji, Zhu Keming, Li Wenjian,

Youxing Defeated

The women's teams of Fudan and Youxing took the stage first. After each scoring three points, Fudan scored six consecutive points. Youxing relied on Cheng Hongsheng's serve to tie it at 8-8, 10-10, and 16-15. Lu Duoyun's serve was powerful, scoring five consecutive points. Fudan won the first game 21-15. Having suffered this setback, Youxing tried to rally. At the beginning of the second game, they led 5-0, and changed courts with a score of 11-0, smoothly creating an absolute advantage of 20-9. They only needed one more point to tie the game. Unexpectedly, the right to serve was taken away, and Fudan's Lu Duoyun repeated the same trick, taking over 12 points and winning again 22-20. Fudan cheered as if they were in a daze, while Youxing was disheartened. Youxing, who had never been defeated, was actually subjected to this humiliation, and will definitely continue to work hard to seek revenge.

Fang Gang Wins Again

Fudan and Fang Gang then fought, adopting a best-of-five format. The competition was fierce, and the audience applauded and cheered. After five ties in the first game, Fang Gang took the lead 11-9. After 18-11, Fudan suddenly increased their score by five points, and actually took the lead 20-19. Unfortunately, they still lost the first game 20-22. After Fang Gang won the second game 21-14, Fudan tried to cheer up. The third game was indeed very successful, and Fang Gang became the follower. Fudan won back the thirteenth game 21-17, but in the last game, Fang Gang's attack was even more dramatic, and Fudan was defeated 21-15.

However, the results, although rumors over the weekend afternoon were untrue, and today's foreign exchange tightened slightly, the gold price rose sharply by 145 yuan.

The morning opening was as high as 3,950 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm and others aggressively stuffed the market, briefly pushing the price down to 3,880 yuan. Then, cash firms and securities gangs strongly supported the price, pulling it back up to 3,955 yuan. Then, because foreign exchange loosened, sellers came in droves. Money exchange firms threw and stuffed the market first, followed by gold firms selling. In addition, securities gangs advanced and then suddenly aggressively suppressed the price, which collapsed, falling to a low of 3,800 yuan. At noon, pawnshops saw low prices and absorbed, raising the price to 3,840 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, at the opening, securities gangs suddenly turned bullish again, causing the price to rise sharply to 3,870 yuan. Soon, because money exchange firms and others stuffed the market, the price fell again to 3,825 yuan. Afterwards, because foreign exchange slightly weakened, coupled with the sudden release of Hong Kong funds, people were agitated. Securities gangs and a certain gold firm took advantage of the situation, and the price rose by more than 100 yuan, reaching a peak of 3,960 yuan. At closing, because retail investors took profits and came out, the price fell back to 3,930 yuan at closing. Trading was brisk, with more than 2,000 taels traded. The price of pawnshop gold jewelry ultimately increased by 5 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Spot Trading Still Lively

Money exchange firms mutually traded 10 taels, the price being 3,950 yuan.

Before long, it had risen by 75 yuan. A certain cash firm bought 20 taels from a money exchange firm for 3,955 yuan. At that time, because foreign exchange hardened, it immediately triggered a selling frenzy. Money exchange firms were the first to throw and stuff the market, and a certain gold firm and cash firms also followed suit. Although securities gangs initially still had an appetite, when the price retreated to the 3,900 yuan mark, they suddenly also vigorously stuffed the market, causing a collapse of 155 yuan. The gold firm sold ten taels to a money exchange firm for 3,800 yuan. Near noon, because news of foreign exchange trending flat came out, the selling frenzy immediately subsided.

Although securities gangs continued to have an appetite, because money exchange firms and a certain gold firm stuffed the market, it soon fell back 45 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 10 taels to a money exchange firm, the price being 3,825 yuan. At that time, because cash firms suddenly came to boost the price, it rose again, once hovering between 3,850 and 3,860 yuan. Afterwards, because foreign exchange was reported to be weak, the buying frenzy was strong. Securities gangs and a certain firm and Hong Kong funds competed to vigorously buy, coupled with very few sellers, resulting in a straight upward leap, increasing by 100 yuan.

### Exchange Rate Fluctuates, English Gold Once at Four, Later Gradually Tightened

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the HSBC listed price unchanged. Although the black market for English and American exchanges did not change much that day, the situation was sometimes tight and sometimes loose, hovering around the weekend noon closing price. Initially, due to concerns about the situation in the Hongqiao area of ​​Shanghai, most bulls adopted a conservative approach. In addition, the Bank of England favorably absorbed spot goods, and the Hong Kong Electric and China Bank aggressively grabbed futures, causing the market to soften. English gold once tightened to three points nine thousand and sixty-two five. American exchange also shrank to six yuan bull. Later, Hong Kong Electric suddenly came back out, and Li and China Bank also changed from grabbing to stuffing, and Sassoon also followed suit, causing the market to loosen. English gold once grew to four points zero six two five, and American exchange also hardened to six yuan eight one two five. At noon, because HSBC's appetite was quite healthy, the situation gradually flattened. The noon closing of English gold was four points, and the American exchange was six yuan seventy-five. In the early afternoon, the situation was extremely flat. After entering, the situation was slightly softer because foreign banks such as HSBC mutually absorbed. As a result, English gold closed at three points nine three seven five, and American exchange closed at six yuan six two five. The trend of this month is similar to the spot price. Ultimately, both English and American exchanges tightened slightly at zero three two two five. Trading was still strong throughout the day.

Selling Frenzy Turned Strong at Noon

At the beginning of the morning, the large London bars and the American bank prices were not telegraphed. London raw gold was still flat, and the exchange rates between English and American, and between English and French were strong. The rate against Shanghai rose by three and five. The rate of American to the Central Government was small by one point two five, not changed against French, and large by one corner against Shanghai. The Central Government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were English gold three points nineteen thousand six hundred and eighty-seven five, and American exchange six yuan sixty-five six two five, compared with the weekend, neither honor nor disgrace. After the opening, operators mostly looked shrunk due to the situation in the Hongqiao area of ​​Shanghai, so there were very few sellers. In addition, the Bank of England favorably absorbed spot goods, and the Hong Kong Electric and China Bank aggressively grabbed futures, so the potential was gradually soft. Li bought spot American exchange from colleagues for six yuan sixty-two five and five six two five. Then Hong Kong Electric pulled in foreign banks for September English gold three points eight hundred and seventy-five, and the same month American exchange six yuan bull. When HSBC's listing revealed that there was no movement, and the silver balance tax revealed that there was also no increase or decrease. Later, China Bank and others concluded with Datong for September American exchange six yuan forty-three seven five. At that time, Chinese businessmen also bought the same price from a certain bank for September American exchange. At that time, the foreign bank's spot selling price of English gold had softened to two points nine thousand and sixty-two five, and the American exchange had tightened to six yuan half. Later, Hong Kong Electric suddenly came back out, and Li and China Bank also stopped buying and started selling. In addition, Western businessman Sassoon also joined the selling frenzy, so the market situation suddenly turned hard. Hong Kong Electric, Sassoon, and Li, China Bank, etc., successively sold spot English gold to HSBC Huabi Maccaghini from three points nine thousand and sixty-two five, to long gold four points zero three one two five. Then China Bank sold spot American exchange six yuan sixty-eight seven five and seventy-five to a certain bank. Later, the foreign bank's spot buying price was the hardest, even passing English gold four points zero six two five and American exchange six yuan eight one two five. Near noon, because the Bank of England's and HSBC's digestive capacity was still healthy, the situation was gradually stabilized. Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was English gold four points, and American exchange six yuan seventy-five, slightly looser at zero three one two five compared to the morning opening English, and slightly harder at zero nine three seven five American.

Li Still Absorbs

In the after-market opening, foreign banks still had supply for the closing price, so the situation was quite flat. After entering, HSBC first absorbed spot English gold four points from colleagues. Then Li and a certain bank also absorbed spot English gold four points and spot American exchange six yuan sixty-eight seven five from Chinese merchants. Therefore, the situation was slightly softer. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were English gold three points nine three seven five, and English exchange six yuan six two five. This month's English gold was three points nine thousand and sixty-two five, and American exchange six yuan five six two five. As a result, compared to the spot and future period of last weekend, both English and American exchanges tightened slightly at zero three one two five.

Hong Kong Maintains Gold Pounds

The current spot rate against Japanese rose by two five, to one hundred and six yuan bull. At 10:30 AM, there was no honor or disgrace.

The so-called three major banks are HSBC, Li, and Maccaghini. The selling price of each bank to the outside world should be limited to one shilling two pence and twenty-five over thirty-two, and the buying price should not exceed one shilling three pence and one over thirty-two. According to the "Balance Sheet" published by the committee in December last year, its liabilities totaled 19,113,487 Hong Kong dollars, which, converted at the exchange rate of one shilling two pence and thirteen over sixteen, is equivalent to 11,196,606 English pounds.

The initial price of American dollars was around fifteen yuan three corners. Later, because the exchange market once trended hard, the English exchange once grew beyond the four point mark, and colleagues aggressively threw and stuffed the market, so it retreated to around fourteen yuan eight corners. Near noon, it recovered slightly to fourteen yuan nine corners. In the afternoon, because the gold price suddenly rose to 3,930 yuan, the guild's listed price also rose to fifteen yuan one corner, but it was still one corner smaller than last weekend.

The Shanghai Public Industry Institute reported that the market was active yesterday. The momentum of the rubber stock market was indeed strong. Due to the increase in the quota, the high value of raw rubber is sufficient to view this trend as no different. Rubber stocks in Shanghai are almost the cheapest among rubber stock markets around the world today. Recently, I read a printed matter from Singapore, which made every effort to draw people's attention to investing in the Shanghai market, saying that it is too attractive. If the current rubber stock price of this Institute is converted into the Singapore currency value, and the number of acres or output of each rubber company is used as the calculation standard, then it will be discovered that its value is low and truly shocking.

### Overseas Cotton Market Falls, Local Selling Prices Do Not Loosen, Trading of White Package Flowers is Lively

The transaction of current cotton is still not weak, but it is slightly clearer than the previous day, because the European and American cotton markets have returned again, and foreign exchange has loosened, but the calculated price is still high. When the local cotton is in the process of concluding new cotton, the trading of white package flowers is progressing daily. As for the daily factory's digestion of the stomach is slightly stagnant, not as smooth as in the past, because the amount absorbed recently is very huge. However, although the Shenxin and Wing On factories have no shortage of reserves, they are currently opening a large number of cotton yarns. The purchase of raw materials is in a batch, and the mutual buying and selling among colleagues is still endless. Changxinghao entered 1,000 pieces of Indian cotton, which is the amount to be sent to the Shenxin Factory. The price of Xintongzhou flower rose by five corners to one yuan, the price of foreign cotton slightly rose, and the source of northern Jiangsu was slightly scarce. More than 500 packages of Tongzhou flowers arrived, and 650 pieces came from Beisha. The current cotton situation is listed on the left.

Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have been very active in recent days. A few days ago, due to the soaring cotton market overseas and the contraction of foreign exchange, the spot prices of the same industry have also soared. Yesterday, the overseas cotton market rebounded slightly, but local selling prices have not been able to loosen, because the various foreign expenses for shipping cotton from overseas to Shanghai are very large. At present, no one from the foreign company is ordering, and all the transactions in March and April are now spot goods among the same industry. This is because the price of this spot commodity is still 30 to 40 yuan cheaper than the foreign company's quoted price.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices, the New York cotton market was quite weak yesterday, because the government's estimated output was more than 900,000 packages more than the report last month, so there were no buyers in the market. At the same time, spot merchants and overseas cotton merchants were doing their best to sell in the market. In addition, the Indian cotton market plummeted, so the New York cotton market fell even more. Until the close, cotton prices fell by three or four called pounds, etc., compared to the previous day. The Egyptian Liverpool market closed, and India, including forecasts, fell by seven Robbie.

### Foodstuffs: Wheat Flour Plant Prices Have Reached Seven Yuan; Speculation in Wheat

The flour market is bustling with activity, and the resale market is even more lively, mainly because of the outbreak of the European war. Foreign flour and wheat are rising in price, and local wheat is also frequently increasing in price, causing considerable confusion in the market. Due to high costs, various mills have added another ten cents to the plant price, reaching seven yuan. Moreover, they only supply the local area and restrict large-scale sales to other places, so resale goods are more popular with customers. It is said that the selling price has exceeded the plant price by thirty to forty cents, and the price of foreign flour is even higher by twenty to thirty cents. Both northern and southern merchants are continuing to purchase, but the quantity is not large. The total volume of transactions for local customers is fifty to sixty thousand bags.

Various sources of wheat are continuously arriving, and factory sales and hoarders' sales channels are also uninterrupted. Amidst the news of rising foreign telegram prices and the increasing price of local flour, those holding goods are solely engaging in speculation, and buyers are also raising prices to absorb the goods. Therefore, the market is becoming more and more active. The Fu and Fu factories in the city have purchased 14,000 bags of wheat to be shipped to Suzhou, Wuxi, Liuhe, Jiangbei, Wuyi, Pudong, etc., and the price has also increased by ten to twenty cents across the board. Hoarders have transported more than ten carts of wheat to Suzhou, Changzhou, Danyang, etc., and the price has also increased by twenty to thirty cents.

General non-industry hoarders who hold stock lists are even taking the opportunity to inflate prices and sell them through door-to-door stores. The standard price of large factory goods is 74 yuan per ton, or 3.7 yuan per hundred catties. The price of small factory goods is one or two yuan cheaper. However, according to a certain factory, Hongji coal fines are arriving continuously, and yesterday there was also a telegram from the mine land to Shanghai, stating that one ship has been loaded. Because white coal fines have no other use except for making coal briquettes, there are no obstacles to navigation, so there is no need to worry about a shortage of raw materials, it is said.

### Oil Market: Mainland and Hong Kong Merchants Slightly Purchase; Soybean Oil Falls in the Morning and Rises in the Afternoon - Raw Oil Prices Are High and Sales Are Stagnant -

Yesterday's soybean oil market situation first followed the weak trend of the weekend, with the opening price falling by twenty cents. Sales in the market were still sluggish. In the afternoon, mainland and Hong Kong merchants slightly inquired, and the market atmosphere slightly improved. The price rebounded, and the results were similar to the previous six prices. A total of 100 barrels of Kobe oil, 70 barrels of Dalian oil, 10 barrels of white oil, 80 barrels of Qingdao oil, 400 pieces of Qingqi oil, and 150 barrels of Jiaozhou oil were transacted. Peanut oil sales were both silent, and the market atmosphere completely depended on the Hong Kong sales for change. This is because the price is too high, and other merchants have no hope of getting involved.

Yesterday, 150 pieces of soybean oil and 1,000 cans of raw oil were shipped to Haiphong. Yesterday, another 520 bags of soybeans were transported from Beisha.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Recovers Slightly; Shanghai Silk Remains Firm

There was no market in New York yesterday. Yokohama silk prices fell. Spot goods were not sold. The near-term September price was 1,581 yuan, down 49 yuan; the October price was 1,571 yuan, down 29 yuan; the far-term February price was 1,500 yuan, down 39 yuan. This was due to the recovery of the Japanese yen exchange rate. There were sporadic transactions in the local silk market by American merchants. The Shanghai factory reported a price of 4,300 yuan for 20-22 silk and 4,250 yuan for tin silk. Nearly 50 dan were transacted. The Baitou Foreign Firm imported 70 dan of Qili native silk, Qianjin, and Hai Zi reeling yesterday. The price of Qianjin silk rose by 30 yuan, and the rest also showed a strong trend. The Qili silk passed through six trading houses. Recently, foreign firms have purchased a lot, so market sales have been stagnant. At the same time, there are few Qili silk stocks in the interior, so Shanghai silk merchants are temporarily watching and waiting and will not easily dump their goods.

### Seafood: Pepper Prices Soar - Since the Outbreak of War Between Germany, Britain, and France

All foreign goods are attracting the attention of hoarders. It has been found that pepper can be stored for a long time without deteriorating, so some people have recently purchased and hoarded it, and the price is very good. Yesterday, Wen Dao white pepper rose to 160 yuan, and Dutch white pepper rose to 145 yuan, a sharp increase of twenty to thirty yuan compared to before. Number one black large pepper rose by fifteen yuan to 120 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Top-Quality Vegetables Rise by Three Yuan

The medium-quality vegetables in the recent market are still weak, but high-quality vegetables are firm due to their scarcity. Yesterday, the Zhenjiang district offered 70 bags of Dou Zi and San Qing Zi top-quality vegetables at a price of 43 yuan, which was three yuan better than before.

### The Situation in Western Shanghai Has Eased; The Municipal Council Is Conducting Negotiations; The Proposed Solutions of the Two Sides Are Far Apart; The Purpose of the Puppet Government Is to Force the Payment of Taxes

The Japanese have long coveted the police authority on the extraterritorial roads in western Shanghai. However, because of the strong attitude of the British and American governments, they have always supported the Shanghai Municipal Council and adopted a resolute stance to deal with the incidents. Therefore, cases such as the Kellogg case and the Kinloch case, which were enough to cause serious problems, have been safely resolved, so the Japanese have not been able to achieve their goals. After the outbreak of the European War and the declarations of war by Britain and France against Germany, the Japanese actions became more active. On the 5th and 6th, they simultaneously asked Britain and France to withdraw their troops in Tokyo and Shanghai. Foreign diplomats in Shanghai knew that the Japanese were taking action on the concession issue. As expected, on September 10th, they sent puppet police to occupy the key points on the extraterritorial roads, and the Japanese military police cooperated with the puppet police to patrol the area. Yesterday, Japanese newspapers openly announced that the police authority on the extraterritorial roads had been "owned by the municipal government." This proves that the so-called "Japanese navy will take necessary steps according to the decision" made by the Japanese embassy and the army and navy spokespersons at the press conference on the 6th has gradually become a reality. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council, in consideration of the difficult times, is unwilling to take any direct action immediately, and is calmly watching its development on the one hand, and is preparing to negotiate with the Japanese through diplomatic means to reduce the severity of the situation on the other hand. However, as of last night, there were reports that this serious problem had been resolved through negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side yesterday morning. The following are the various news reports:

The Infringement of Rights by the Japanese Puppets Will Never Be Recognized

Regarding the issue of police authority on the extraterritorial roads, what actions will the Shanghai Municipal Council take in the future? A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency specially interviewed a senior British official in Shanghai yesterday to inquire about the truth. According to the official, the Shanghai Municipal Council will absolutely not recognize the Japanese puppets' extraterritorial infringement of rights. Because although Japanese soldiers and puppet police have invaded the extraterritorial roads in recent days, the occupied areas are the houses in the Japanese military occupation zone along the road, and they have never interfered with the Shanghai Municipal Council's exercise of police authority in the western Shanghai area. Therefore, it is not planned to take immediate action to increase the severity of the situation, but it is prepared to negotiate with the Japanese through diplomatic means. In order to prevent the occurrence of the same incident as the Kinloch case, the Shanghai Municipal Council seems to have no choice but to take this step.

The Fu Bureau Has Begun Negotiations

Yesterday's Western newspapers reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting at 11:00 a.m. the day before to discuss this issue, but the Shanghai Municipal Council denied it yesterday, saying only that it is currently contacting the consular corps regarding this case and intends to negotiate with the Japanese. However, a reliable source told a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency at 6:00 p.m. yesterday that the Shanghai Municipal Council had resolved the issue of police authority on the extraterritorial roads with the Japanese side at a meeting yesterday morning, returning the old police authority on the extraterritorial roads to the Shanghai Municipal Council and giving the police authority on the newly opened extraterritorial roads to the puppet "municipal government." However, it has not been confirmed. It is only certain that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side officially began negotiations yesterday. However, it is heard that the Japanese demands are far from the rumored solutions. It is rumored that the authorities are following the following paths to resolve the issue: (1) Re-divide the police authority on the extraterritorial roads, and determine which areas belong to the Shanghai Municipal Council and which areas belong to the puppet municipal government. (2) The police authority belongs to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the taxes belong to the puppet "municipal government." If this is the case, it will inevitably be opposed by the Chinese side.

The Puppet Government Attempts to Force the Payment of Taxes

Since the Japanese puppets have been stationed in the area of the extraterritorial roads in western Shanghai and have investigated the residents, there have been rumors that the puppet "municipal government" will force the residents in the area to pay house donations and land rent to the puppet government. A reporter recently inquired about the opinion of a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council. According to the official, the responsibility for the residents of the extraterritorial roads to pay donations is entirely determined by the residents themselves. The residents and the Shanghai Municipal Council only have a contractual relationship based on the payment of donations. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council is only concerned with the issue of paying donations and taxes to the bureau. As for whether a third party can collect residents' taxes in the area, it is not something the bureau wants to interfere with. All residents of the extraterritorial roads who pay donations and taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council will also be provided with various municipal conveniences such as water, electricity, gas, telephone, and roads as an equivalent exchange. Conversely, if the residents in the area refuse to pay taxes, the Shanghai Municipal Council will cut off the supply of these various municipal conveniences. The bureau has taken this kind of measure in many cases before and after the Shanghai War to deal with residents who do not pay taxes to the bureau. The official also said that the donations and taxes collected by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the area in the first half of this year were only 520,000 yuan, while the expenditure for maintaining the municipal services in the area was huge, far exceeding the income. Moreover, since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, it has been slightly difficult for the Shanghai Municipal Council to collect donations in the area of the extraterritorial roads.

The Situation in Western Shanghai Has Eased Yesterday

Since the Japanese puppets have been stationed in the area of Extra-Territorial Road Jessfield Road and Yu Garden Road since the 9th, the military police have been coming and going frequently, causing rumors and panic among the residents. However, yesterday, the atmosphere has eased slightly, but the Japanese puppets are still heavily guarded in the area bordering the concession and western Shanghai. The following is a detailed record of the actual inspection of the atmosphere by a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency:

Japanese Soldiers and Puppet Police Have Been Reduced

After the Ci Lian Society at 11 Jessfield Road was occupied by the Japanese puppets on the 9th, there were 30 to 40 Japanese military police and puppet police stationed there. However, yesterday it has been reduced to puppet police, the remaining people, and three or four Japanese military police. There were originally more than ten Japanese puppets stationed beside the sandbags placed in front of the gate, but yesterday only puppet police were left to guard the gate. As for the two rooms downstairs in the house, they have been occupied for office use. Refugees still live upstairs as usual. A temporary wooden house was built in the inner room to open a middle school for refugee children. Now, due to the uneasy environment, classes cannot be held as usual. As for the armed puppet police stationed outside Qiuyuan at 15 Jessfield Road, they have all stayed inside the room yesterday and no longer set up posts outside. As for the Kangjia Bridge, Jinjia Lane, and Malu Bridge areas, the situation is still the same as the day before. Japanese soldiers and puppet police are still densely stationed on the road as usual.

Residents Are Prohibited from Moving Furniture

There are several puppet police stationed at the entrances of the Yu Garden Road Calling Ming Villa and the Zhongshi New Village, but yesterday they have been reduced to two people per alley. They still do not interfere with people entering and leaving, but they do not allow residents to move furniture and sundries out. Those who try to move items out will be confiscated. The number of puppet police stationed at the Kena Road intersection has also been reduced to three.

Police Cars from the Police Department Patrol as Usual

After the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank staff dormitory at 1760 Jing'an Temple Road was occupied by the Japanese puppets on the 10th, sandbags were piled up in front of the gate, and Japanese soldiers and puppet police were stationed there. Yesterday, the number of sandbags in that place has been doubled, but there are only four puppet police stationed there. The residents in the dormitory have been forced to move out since yesterday, but they are still free to carry out their personal belongings. Three large trucks that the dormitory equipped for transporting staff were detained by the Japanese puppets when they returned to the dormitory and driven to western Shanghai. As for the red police cars of the police department, they were still patrolling in the Jessfield Road Caojiadu area yesterday. The traffic of Japanese puppet troops is not as frequent as the day before. The British army has not taken any action, and the residents have not moved out yet.

### The United States Has a Certain Limit to Concessions on the Concession Issue

Japan Avoids Conflict with the United States

According to a foreign person familiar with the situation in the concession, although the Japanese puppets have recently increased the number of police and military police on the Extra-Territorial Road and repeatedly occupied civilian houses on Jessfield Road to set up posts, the situation is quite serious, but in terms of the overall status of the concession, no changes will occur for the time being. Shanghai is an international city, and among the great powers related to Shanghai, in addition to Britain and France, the United States is in a decisive position. When Britain and France are busy with affairs in Europe, Japan can indeed exert pressure on Britain and France to exchange for certain concessions, and the same is true for the concession. However, because the United States is firmly in the middle, Japan must consider the United States and stop at the right time when it is not determined to conflict with the United States. This can be seen from Japan's consistent attitude of avoiding conflict with the United States.

Deeply Fears Being Blockaded by the United States

There are three reasons why Japan is so concerned about the United States: (1) In the past, Japan's trade with the United States reached 1.3 billion yen annually. Most of Japan's military kerosene and cotton rely on the United States for supply, while Japan's industrial products such as raw silk and rayon rely on the United States as their largest sales market. Once the United States imposes an economic blockade on Japan, Japan will suffer a fatal blow. (2) The economic power of the United States is several times higher than that of Japan in peacetime. Now that Japan is exhausted after a long-term war, it cannot be compared with the United States. If Japan offends the United States and goes to war with the United States, it will be difficult to win a decisive battle with the strength of the United States Navy, and it will inevitably expand for a long time. In this case, the economic power of the United States and Japan is so far apart, and there is no reason for Japan not to lose. (3) Since the September 18th Incident, the United States has held a negative attitude towards Japan, and the United States has the determination to resist aggression. The voice of justice has spread far and wide. The United States in the Far East will never be willing to retreat and lose its rights, just like Britain did in Europe in the past. Japan knows all this very well, so when the United States suddenly abolished the US-Japan Commercial Treaty and broke up the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, Japan did not dare to do anything, but instead expressed goodwill to the United States.

Has Concerns About the Shanghai Issue

Today, the United States has expressed its determination not to allow the status of Shanghai to be changed. The US State Department stated that the United States' actions in the Far East are more important than words. The United States has once again expressed its determination to adhere to its determination with action. Therefore, the future of Shanghai can be inferred based on the United States as a fulcrum. Of course, the United States will not intervene in the attack on the Shanghai Concession by Japanese local soldiers within a certain range, and will leave it to Britain and France to handle it properly. However, if Japan's actions exceed a certain limit and hinder the status of the concession, the United States must abide by its promise and take action. In the Gulangyu incident, because the United States was involved (Gulangyu is also a joint concession of Britain, France, and the United States), it adopted a military policy under the promotion of the United States, so that Japan had to give up its attempt to occupy Gulangyu by force. Lessons from the past can be learned. Japan must have concerns about the United States on the Shanghai issue.

### British Ambassador Tells British Nationals in China to Work Hard in Their Respective Positions; Loyalty to the Country Does Not Necessarily Mean Joining the Army; Be Patient and Wait for Instructions from London

Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, broadcast a speech to British nationals in China at 1:15 p.m. yesterday (the 10th) on the XMHD China-America Radio, hoping that British nationals in China would work hard in their respective positions and settle down in their jobs before receiving instructions from the government. The Ambassador also described his own experiences in the World War in 1914 in great detail. The following is a transcript of his speech:

Respectfully Offer Further Advice to British Nationals

I am the British Ambassador to China, and I am fortunate to have this opportunity to say a few words to my fellow British nationals in China. I am only speaking to men today, with absolutely no spirit of discrimination. My goal is to offer a little advice to those who need it. The reason why I am using radio broadcasting instead of newspapers is because there is no other way to reach those of you who live in remote parts of China.

How to Best Serve the Country

We have been at war for a week. You all know what caused this war, so I don't need to repeat it. At this time, we are all thinking about how we can best serve the country.

Prevented from Enlisting in the Last European War

When we decided to go to war twenty-five years ago, I still remember my own feelings. At that time, I was a junior diplomat. My first thought was to join the army. During the four years of the war, I was prevented from enlisting by senior authorities for three whole years. I still remember how passionate my determination to oppose the authorities was, and how frustrated I was when I obeyed their orders.

Deeply Admire Patriotic Enthusiasm

But those who controlled my fate were better able to measure my usefulness than I was. Although I was often in pain, I later realized that their actions were appropriate. Today, the feelings of most of you must be the same as my feelings in the past, that is, asking yourself how you can best serve the country, and believing that you should occupy a position in the army. I can assure you that no one sympathizes with this kind of feeling more than I do.

Remaining in Your Original Position is Serving the Country

Listeners, your position does not necessarily have to be in the army. You live in China, tens of thousands of miles away from the battlefield. It takes many weeks to return to your country, and it takes even longer for your service to be put into practice. Most of you must be willing to do your best to return home as soon as possible. This kind of wish is both natural and admirable. But I don't believe this is the only right way. I hope those who listen to me will remember that your eagerness to return home may not be very helpful to the country. I think it is better for many of you to stay in China and remain in your original position. This is the best way to fulfill your duty to the country, and to wait for the opportunity to consider and determine the special suitability of your service.

Be Patient and Wait for Instructions

Although the final choice is up to you, the necessary organization for what I call "determining the special suitability of your service" is being established. I can do nothing but advise at the moment, but I feel there is no need for me to say more. My advice is given in a spirit of complete sympathy and based on a rational judgment. So please be patient.

The Entire Matter is Awaiting Instructions

And I can assure you that your loyalty and eagerness to serve will definitely be noticed by the government. The government expects you to have this kind of loyalty, but the government will not reduce its gratitude because you should have this kind of loyalty. I am asking London for instructions on the entire matter. I think it is better for us to wait and see what our government needs and how it can best use us.

### Implementation of Revenue Stamps as Currency; Cash Redemption Upon Accumulation of Revenue Stamps to One Corner; It is Still a Better Transitional Solution

Since the Citizens' Federation proposed to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, the Money Industry Association, the Taxpayers' Associations of the Two Concessions, and the Tobacco Exchange Association to implement revenue stamps as currency to solve the difficulty of the lack of small change and to prevent the aftermath of value vouchers, the plan is accurate and redeemable, and all parties have expressed sympathy and hope that it can be implemented as soon as possible. It is now known that after the Municipal Federation published the revenue stamp currency plan, in order to avoid the usual value voucher mistakes and to effectively protect the interests of voucher holders, the Tongchun Drug Store, Fukang Soy Sauce Garden, and other businesses have printed and issued revenue stamp currency vouchers, mostly made of cardboard. In addition to attaching revenue stamps, they are also sealed with transparent paper and stamped with a seal. The vouchers can be used to exchange goods, and when ten points have been accumulated, they can be exchanged for one corner of French currency. Before the government's small change vouchers arrive in Shanghai, this is still a better transitional solution.

### Jewish People Arriving in Port Today Will Be Allowed to Land; The Special Immigration Committee Will Not Take Any Action for the Time Being

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council stated this morning (the 11th) that 400 German Jewish people will arrive in Shanghai on the Conte Rosso tomorrow (the 12th), and the authorities will allow them to land as usual. The Special Immigration Committee will not take any action for the time being, because it has not yet received the Japanese recommendations for immigration, and the date of the decision-making meeting has not been announced.

### Closing of Shanghai German Trading Firm Branch Offices; Employees from Other Locations Flock to Shanghai; Headquarters in Shanghai Attempting to Place Them

According to the English "China Press," several large German trading firms, whose China headquarters are located in Shanghai, have begun to liquidate their branch offices in various coastal ports in China in recent days. Due to the suspension of German shipping and the sharp decline in exports, many German trading firms have been forced to at least temporarily suspend business at their branch offices. As a result of these closures, a large number of German employees from various branch offices are flocking to Shanghai. Some have already departed, while others will be leaving soon. The headquarters in Shanghai will attempt to place them. Local German trading firms have recently felt a shortage of German employees. The arrival of employees from the branch offices will not only alleviate this shortage but will also lead to a surplus of German (Aryan) employees. German trading firms have now established a special committee to provide advice.

### Corpse of Japanese National Nakajo Transported to Shanghai; Yoyang Maru Attacked by Guerrillas; Nakajo Killed, His Companions Injured

The Shanghai Mantetsu Office of the Japanese Trading Company dispatched staff member Nakajo Toraki (27 years old) and others to the Jiujiang area at the beginning of this month to investigate mining. Unexpectedly, the Japanese ship Yoyang Maru, on which Nakajo was traveling, was attacked by Chinese guerrillas on the 5th while sailing 40 miles downstream from Jiujiang. At that time, bullets rained down. In the chaos, Nakajo was shot in the abdomen. Two other Japanese nationals, Fukude Ushimatsu (27 years old) and Matsuno no Hito (29 years old), were also wounded by bullets. Nakajo died soon after due to his serious injuries. The Yoyang Maru arrived in Shanghai at 2 PM yesterday, and Nakajo's body was also transported to Shanghai at the same time.

### Market Vendors Oppose Collection of Foreign Labor Fees on Local Goods

Market vendors in this city, due to the collection of foreign labor fees on local goods in the area around Old Zha Gate Bridge, believe that this is illegal extortion and additional exploitation. They have collectively opposed it. Therefore, vendor Hu Lu Qingquan and others initiated the organization of a Vendor Friendship Association and sent personnel to investigate the origins of the foreign labor fees at various local goods markets. They learned that the local goods markets in Caojiadu, Shiliupu, and other places do not collect foreign labor fees or extort customary fees. Therefore, all the vendors felt even more indignant. The entire community is anxious, and they have unanimously raised their opposition, sending letters to the Local Goods Trade Association and the Municipal Council, requesting them to investigate and ban these illegal foreign labor fees in order to comply with regulations and benefit the poor.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Continues to Specify Items for Embargo

The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently continued to designate the following items for embargo: (1) Garlic: A telegram from the Ministry of Military Affairs stated that garlic is also one of the raw materials for Western medicine. If exported in large quantities, it should be included in the embargo list. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has designated and announced this. (2) Rapeseed, Rapeseed Oil: A telegram from the Ministry of Military Affairs stated that rapeseed and rapeseed oil can be used as substitutes for military oil. They should be embargoed. It is necessary to investigate the production volume and current prices to find ways to purchase them. However, horse mane and hair are used very little in the military and there is no need to embargo them.

### Hardware Parts Association Standard Pricing

Since the outbreak of the European war, various industries in this city have been raising prices due to the inability to ship foreign goods that have already been transacted. The Shanghai Hardware Parts Trade Association has noticed that the prices of various kinds of linked door locks sold by businesses are inconsistent. In order to standardize the prices, it convened a price evaluation committee meeting at its clubhouse on Tianjin Road at 3 PM yesterday. Chairman Wang Yuanzhang first reported the purpose of the meeting and the difficult situation of the industry. Then, he solicited the opinions of the committee members and officially set standard prices. Later, it was decided that the selling price of various hardware parts should be appropriately increased by 30% based on the price of the goods upon arrival. The selling prices are all detailed in regulations.

### Date for Sale of Tribute Rice at Official Prices; Locations for Rice Distribution Have Been Fully Selected; Price of Broken Rice Set at Fourteen Yuan Per Stone

A total of five rice distribution points have been set up in the International Settlement and the French Concession. The directors of each location have been decided and the locations have been fully selected. Preparation began yesterday. The official sales will begin simultaneously on either this Saturday or next Monday. The locations are: (1) Vacant lot at the intersection of North Henan Road and Old Boundary Road. Tent construction started yesterday. (2) Vacant lot at the intersection of Avenue Road and Carter Road. Tent construction is scheduled to begin today. (3) Jade Buddha Temple on Pinlang Road. These locations are in the International Settlement. (4) Shandong Guild Hall at 249 Ximen Road. (5) Danjing Temple on Avenue Petain. These locations are in the French Concession. The total amount of rice for official sale is 8,000 bags, each bag containing one stone and two dou and a half. Among them, there are 1,000 bags of broken rice. The price of foreign rice is ten yuan per stone, and the price of broken rice is fourteen yuan per stone. Each person can purchase up to two yuan worth of rice. It has been decided that each location will initially issue 100 bags, and the distribution will continue until all 8,000 bags have been sold. The three-part tickets for the rice distribution have been printed and rice will be collected with tickets in the future. The distribution of broken rice will be carried out after the foreign rice has been sold out. The quality of the broken rice is the same as that of the foreign rice. At the time of the distribution, the settlement authorities will dispatch police officers to protect it. It is also reported that the Accountant Association's registration for ordering foreign rice has reached 10,000 bags. The initiators informed the association to inform all trade associations and manufacturers who have requested forms to register by Tuesday and Wednesday (i.e., today and tomorrow). Because the initiators believe that the amount ordered is sufficient, this batch of orders will be prioritized. Therefore, a meeting of subscribers will be convened this week. Registration after this time will have to be extended to the next batch before an order can be placed.

### Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Wenzhou Shipping Lines Experience Difficulties; Shanghai-Oujiang Line Has Resumed Navigation; This Could Greatly Facilitate Cargo Transport to the Interior; Yingzhou Wheel to Sail Directly from Zhenhai to Hong Kong

The Shanghai-Oujiang line, which had been blockaded by the Japanese Navy and suspended for more than two months, has now resumed navigation. Taichangxiang's Xinxiangtai Wheel left Shanghai at noon on (day of the week) and is expected to arrive at the mouth of the Oujiang River this morning.

Following this, Yilong Company's Shenfu Wheel and Huatai Company's Xin'antong Wheel, managed by Huatai Company, are scheduled to depart for Wenzhou tomorrow (the 13th). If cargo handling procedures are not completed in time, it may be delayed by one day. The local authorities have been asked for approval. However, the movement of Japanese warships on the sea is uncertain, which is very important for the population problem. It is reported that Yijiang's Shen'ai Wheel is sailing directly from Keelung to Wenzhou and has now arrived there. Therefore, after the success of the trial voyage, it should greatly facilitate cargo transport to the interior. There should also be no concern about the supply of firewood and charcoal in this city. Although the cargo transport on the Ningbo line has improved compared to before, the loading and unloading of goods in Zhenhai Port is very inconvenient. Therefore, the ship's schedule has been delayed for a long time. Zhongyi Company's Ende Wheel returned to Shanghai the night before last (Sunday), after a round trip of three weeks. It is now scheduled to continue to Zhenhai Port on the morning of the 14th. It is reported that whether Moufu Wheel will return to Shanghai tomorrow (the upper third day) and continue sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route will be decided after the ship arrives in Shanghai. Far East Company's Hana Wheel will also return to Shanghai. Taikoo Company's Yingzhou Wheel is still in Zhenhai Port, waiting to unload cargo. It is reported that after the cargo from Ningbo is unloaded, the ship may not come to Shanghai and will sail directly to Hong Kong. Also, Xin'anna Wheel will sail directly from Shanghai to Zhenhai on the morning of the 14th.

### Japanese Officials Visit French Police Station; All Circles, Do Not Lightly Listen to Rumors

Yesterday afternoon, there was a sudden, absurd, and laughable rumor in this city, claiming that an incident occurred at the Second Special District Court of the French Concession. This rumor is not worth mentioning, but for the sake of the deep concern of all circles, this reporter will publish the information obtained by the Xinhua News Agency to dispel the misunderstandings of all circles. It turns out that yesterday afternoon, at around 2 PM, four Japanese officials in plain clothes went to the French General Patrol Room in Lujiazui in car number 4758. It is reported that it was an ordinary courtesy visit. They left after a short time. The big rumor started from this.

### Pseudo-Market Compresses the Meat Industry; Negotiations Continue

The fresh meat industry in this city previously suspended operations due to unbearable pressure from the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. After several negotiations, it finally received a reply from the council of the "Market," agreeing to stop brokers from arbitrarily raising market prices and from mixing second and third-class goods with first-class goods. Although the fresh meat industry felt that the reply was unsatisfactory, in order to take care of the needs of the citizens and reduce the losses of pig traders, it temporarily resumed full operations on the 7th of this month and continued negotiations at the same time. It is now learned that the industry will send personnel to Hongkou again tomorrow or the day after tomorrow with a letter, stating their position and not stopping until their goal is achieved. On the 7th and 8th of this month, the French Concession Slaughtering Industry Friendship Association published a notice, requesting the fresh meat industry to restore the "lottery" method agreed upon by the meat industry association before the 20th year of the Republic of China and the 18th year of the Republic of China, starting from the 14th of this month. The French Concession fresh meat industry has not yet received written notice from the association and does not know where the association is located or who is in charge. They believe that the lottery method has many abuses and is difficult to accept immediately. Therefore, they also published a notice today, stating their attitude.

### Case of Four Chinese in Tianjin; Sir Mooson Hears the Case; Listens to Reports from Lawyer Jones and Others; Discusses Trial Method After Extradition

According to the English "China Press," Sir Mooson, a judge of the British Supreme Court for China, held a hearing in his office this morning (the 11th) on the writ of habeas corpus issued regarding the case of the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin. The details are unknown, but it is reported that there was a discussion on how to decide the trial method after the British authorities handed over the four criminals, and the hearing was adjourned until the end of this week. It is also reported that Judge Mooson opened a court session at the British Supreme Court this morning to hear reports from Lawyer Jones and others. It is heard that there is no concrete plan yet. The deliberation on the decision-making direction of the case is still under discussion and will not be stopped because the four Chinese suspects have been extradited to the "Chinese Court" under the jurisdiction of the Japanese. The case opened from morning to noon yesterday before adjourning the court.

### Trends in Eurasian Postal Transportation; American and Italian Ships Will Arrive as Usual Today; Yangzi Ship Bound for Europe Refuses to Load Transshipment Cargo

Since the outbreak of the European war, commercial ships from various countries have been affected, resulting in delays in schedules. However, American ships are sailing as usual. Here are the recent trends of various postal ships:

President Lines, President Coolidge, departed from Los Angeles on the 21st of last month, passed through Japan, and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at noon today, berthed at buoy 11.12. The passenger tender, Mary Muller, will depart from the Xinguanyima Terminal at 12:00 noon today, and return to the Xinguanyima Terminal at 1:30 PM after picking up passengers. The ship is scheduled to leave on the morning of the 13th (tomorrow) at 7:30 AM for Hong Kong. The passenger tender is undecided. Tonight at midnight (i.e., morning of the 13th) at 1:00 AM, it will depart from the Xinguanyima Terminal. The ship will return to Shanghai from the United States on the 25th of this month.

Italian Lines, Conte Biancamano, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Genoa as per the original schedule, at noon today, berthed at the Gonghexiong Dock in Hongkou. The passenger tender will pick up Chinese passengers and take them to the Xinguanyima Terminal to disembark. It is heard that the ship also carries more than 500 Jewish people, who will disembark in Hongkou with the Western passengers. The ship was originally scheduled to return to Europe from Shanghai on the 14th. Since the company's Conte Rosso was delayed until the 14th, the sailing schedule of Conte Biancamano was slightly delayed. From a procedural point of view, it will be possible to return to Europe on the 11th. The company's Conte Rosso, which was originally berthed at the Gonghexiong Dock, has been there for many days. The morning before last (Saturday), because another ship was scheduled to berth at the dock, it sailed to Wusongkou for temporary anchorage. However, the export cargo has not been fully loaded. It is scheduled to return to the Huangpu River this morning, change berths to the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong to load cargo, and is scheduled to set sail on the morning of the 14th and return to Venice.

It has now been completed and is scheduled to export this morning and sail to Japan. It will return to Shanghai from Japan around the 25th of this month and return to Europe. According to the company yesterday, the cargo for return to Europe has already been booked in advance by various Hakka merchants. The tonnage of cargo to Haiphong and Saigon has also been filled. It is heard that the company will not load any transshipment cargo this time. The company's ships to Saigon are mostly handled by the China-France Express Company in this city.

Recently, due to the uncertainty of Taikoo's shipping schedule, most of the cargo to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia is reported to be loaded on the company's ships. Therefore, the business is exceptionally prosperous. It is heard that Tjillegonah has already been fully loaded, with Hong Kong cargo being the most numerous. In addition, the ships managed by Qiacheng Shenxing on Avenue Edward VII and Tongyi Shipping Company on the Bund are very crowded with passengers and cargo to Hong Kong.

### Unseen Rise in Rickshaw Prices

In this city's two concessions, the daily rental of each rickshaw was 55 cents in national currency before the war.

Unexpectedly, the prices of rubber, hardware parts, and other materials have soared by three to five times recently. In order to remedy this, various companies have agreed to increase the rental to 42 cents. At the same time, due to the rising rice prices, the lives of rickshaw pullers have been greatly affected. They have now invisibly increased the prices for passengers by an average of about 20% compared to before.

### European Sales Stagnate, Japanese Silk Competes; Silk Factories Will Stop Production; Raw Materials Also in Short Supply, Future Prospects Difficult to Be Optimistic; Value Plunged Due to the Influence of Easing Foreign Exchange

Due to the lack of raw materials, only about 20 silk factories in Shanghai are勉强operating as of now. It is expected that all of them will stop production after the end of September. As for the foreign sales of Chinese silk, they have been affected by the European war. Sales to the United Kingdom and France have almost completely stopped. However, sales to the United States and the Philippines have not been affected. Prices have been affected by the easing of foreign exchange, resulting in a decline. Fortunately, they are now gradually rising again, but future prospects are difficult to be optimistic about, because the dumping of Japanese silk abroad is becoming more and more intense.

Jiangsu and Zhejiang Autumn Cocoons Begin to Enter the Market

The listing of fresh cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is divided into three periods each year: spring, summer, and autumn. However, spring cocoons are the most important. Autumn cocoons are second. The production of summer cocoons is not much and is not important. This year's autumn cocoons have already begun to enter the market in Zhejiang Province, and they can also enter the market in Jiangsu Province in a week. However, due to weather conditions, the harvest is less than that of spring cocoons. In cities where these autumn cocoons are controlled by the Japanese army, they are統制collected and purchased by the "China Silk Company." In townships, manufacturers are allowed to purchase freely, but it is stipulated that the cocoons collected by manufacturers must be given to the China Silk Company in half."

Shanghai Manufacturers Unwilling to Purchase

In view of the obstruction of the "China Silk Company" when purchasing spring cocoons this year, the silk reeling factories in the Shanghai concession were only allowed to transport half of them to Shanghai after repeated negotiations. Therefore, the manufacturers suffered significant losses. Therefore, they regard the purchase of autumn cocoons with fear and are unwilling to set up an office to purchase them. Although autumn cocoons have already entered the market, manufacturers have no preparations to collect cocoons. At the same time, the number of household silk factories in the interior has surged, and they are all collecting cocoons and reeling silk locally for the use of the interior silk factories.

Hygiene for Both Sexes

### Husband and Wife Become Close Through Cohabitation; If Excessively Indulgent, There Will Be Endless Harm

— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

From the perspective of the country, marriage is mainly for giving birth to children and providing them with a good education. From an individual perspective, it is for maintaining a stable sex life. However, the meaning of marriage is not only that. It is important to form a social, economic, and spiritual unity. This unity, outwardly, manifests as a common, material life of mutual benefit. Inwardly, it shows the closeness of the spiritual relationship between husband and wife. Before marriage, it is necessary to have a lot of sympathy for each other; however, it is also common for the spiritual relationship to become closer after marriage due to sex life. Therefore, it is clear that marriage can affect men and women both spiritually and physically. According to statistics, the average human lifespan can be extended by marriage. This is because after marriage, life becomes regular, maintenance can be thorough, and there are also other good factors. At all ages, the number of deaths among unmarried people is always higher than that of married people.

Marriage is beneficial to the human body, which is undeniable. However, if the two sides have incompatible personalities or have problems with not being able to reproduce, they should change their partner. Otherwise, the harm is truly unimaginable, and parents must also deeply consider it. It is truly a sad and unfair thing for a purely white and healthy woman to marry an unworthy husband and someone who cannot be a father. It has a great impact on the health of the nation.

At the beginning of married life, because it is completely different from the solitary life before marriage, sometimes they will be excessively affectionate, indulging in excessive sex, which causes their health to decline. Over time, kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, brain weakness, insomnia, and other symptoms are unavoidable. Those who suffer from this have a decline in their ability for sex, the married life cannot be coordinated, and love gradually becomes indifferent. The way to remedy this is to exercise restraint and start with increasing essence and nourishing blood. Those who have suffered from nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, kidney deficiency, and impotence before marriage can also use the same method, taking the German testicular essence preparation "Body-Comp" for men to achieve the functions of nourishing the kidneys, nourishing blood, nourishing essence, and nourishing the brain. This agent was invented by German physiologist Dr. Mering and has been used by more than 3,900 physicians around the world for experiments. All believe that it is a symptomatic medicine for treating sexual weakness and loss of health. The one for women also has the function of regulating menstruation and planting seeds. It is an effective medicine in gynecology.

Spring and Autumn of Gonorrhea

### Obtaining Practical Treatment for Gonorrhea

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine in the United States

For the treatment of diseases, its efficacy should be obvious. It is not necessary to use publicity methods to deceive patients. Instead, it should be shown with the truth of efficacy. The so-called fact is better than eloquence. For example, the medicine for treating gonorrhea must be in accordance with science in order to have true efficacy. Originally, gonorrhea has been a source of anxiety for general physicians, who have wanted to invent a special medicine, but have finally failed. However, the general public does not know about their own research failures, and sings about what trans-membrane sterilization, local therapy, etc., are all effects that have no practical effect. However, because there are many ignorant people, they are fortunate enough to gain popularity for a while, but soon they are broken by facts and disappear silently. The reason is that gonococcus is not only guarding the front and rear urethra, nor is it only固守the old position between the mucous membranes. It is a low-level bacteria that is good at escaping. It flows everywhere, so it also causes inflammation and pain everywhere, giving rise to various gonorrhea symptoms. For example, those who窜入the blood and滞于the joints will become arthritis. Those who窜入the urinary organs will develop cystitis. Those who窜入the internal reproductive organs will develop orchitis, etc. Most of the gonorrhea that has become such symptoms has been mistaken by gonorrhea medicine that has no practical effect.

Only Dr. Peter, a German master of gonorrhea, devoted his life's efforts to invent and use a mixture of protein and yellow pigment to make the "Klinon" medicine, which is famous all over the world today. After taking this agent, it can cause the whole body's cells to produce anti-gonorrheal phagocytic effects. Its bactericidal power directly reaches the lesion. Wherever there is gonococcus, the bactericidal effect of "Klinon" will occur. Therefore, regardless of whether it is early gonorrhea or long-term gonorrhea, and regardless of whether it is male or female, they can all take "Klinon" and be cured without any adverse side effects. For external use in men, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used to wash the urethra. For women, "Karell Shedi's Vaginal Tablets" can be used as suppositories to achieve great success.

### A Secret Formula for Relieving Coughs and Curing Lung Ailments

— By Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang

Whether in traditional Chinese or Western medicine, coughs are considered a difficult ailment to treat. Consequently, lung diseases are far more prevalent than any other infectious disease, and their mortality rate is truly alarming. Therefore, the general public should not regard a cold and cough as a minor ailment and neglect treatment. Even if one unfortunately progresses from an incurable cough to lung disease, one should not be pessimistic. In reality, lung diseases are not as fearsome as most doctors claim. As long as one takes care of their health and receives proper treatment, there is nothing mysterious about it. Based on my experience, the medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" is highly effective in relieving coughs and treating lung ailments. Even cases of hemoptysis (coughing up blood) in the second or third stage can be completely cured with this medicine. However, during the recovery period, it is important to rest and avoid strenuous activities, and to consume plenty of nutritious food. In this way, the ailment can be easily cured. These are the essential conditions for healing from pulmonary tuberculosis.

### Worsening Condition Due to Mistakenly Taking Inferior Medicine for Spermatorrhea

— By Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

A patient named Lu Rujing, from Jiashan, 21 years old, stated: "My body is generally healthy, but I had enuresis (bedwetting) as a child, which only stopped at the age of fourteen. When I was sixteen, I entered a private middle school and, influenced by older classmates in the same dormitory, I developed the bad habit of masturbation—performing it several times every night. This greatly depleted my essence and blood. After about half a year, I started involuntarily masturbating in my sleep, leading to spermatorrhea (involuntary ejaculation). Because my family was not wealthy, I did not seek treatment, and I could not completely quit the habit of masturbation. After a year, I developed neurasthenia (nervous weakness), insomnia, and memory loss. I was extremely worried and, influenced by advertisements, I purchased and took some kind of sperm-strengthening pills. While they were temporarily effective, spermatorrhea and seminal emission recurred as soon as I stopped taking them. Realizing I had been deceived, I didn't know what to do. Now, on the recommendation of a friend, I have come for treatment." (Treatment process) - I instructed him to completely abstain from masturbation, strictly adhere to health preservation, maintain a pure mind and few desires, and prescribed "Nairisi Spermatorrhea Pills" to fundamentally cure his spermatorrhea. Additionally, I prescribed "Bu Ti Kang" for men to replenish his deficiencies. After twelve weeks of treatment, the spermatorrhea has ceased, his spirit has greatly improved, he sleeps soundly, and his weight and appetite have significantly increased.

Lecture on Gonorrhea

### Risky Entertainment

— Written by Doctor Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road

Everyone knows that gonorrhea is a highly dreaded venereal disease. However, many people, due to their physiological urges or psychological needs, often engage in this risky game. As a result, they often contract white discharge (a symptom of gonorrhea). Once infected with this disease, distressing symptoms appear. If they encounter incompetent doctors and inferior medicine at this early stage, the bacteria will be pushed inward, leading to various prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, and other conditions, which are the consequences of untreated gonorrhea patients. Because the infectivity of these gonorrhea toxins is extremely high, if one has contact with their spouse before being cured, the innocent spouse will also suffer from this promiscuous disease. Is this not a tragedy? Therefore, I always advise people to pay special attention to this disease. Otherwise, they will create a catastrophe, not only harming their spouses but also destroying their life's happiness, which is truly regrettable. However, in many situations, one should be aware that since this disease is very difficult to treat, one should seek treatment from the most experienced doctor at the onset to avoid the aggravation of gonorrhea.

Regarding the treatment of general gonorrhea, most people are short-sighted, only seeking superficial effects and proclaiming them as good medicine. They do not know that such over-the-counter medicines often delay treatment, leading to more complications and making it more difficult to manage. Over the past twenty years, I have encountered many cases where patients could not be cured by taking over-the-counter antibacterial and chemical therapy drugs. I instructed them to take the gonorrhea-specific drug "Kelinong," and also used German static electricity therapy and anti-gonorrhea serum, which can quickly achieve remarkable results for gonorrhea patients. It has been tested hundreds of times with no failures. Therefore, while patronizing prostitutes is risky entertainment, seeking medical treatment and taking medicine carelessly is even riskier. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, twenty appointment numbers will be given out daily, with each number costing only five jiao.

### Driving a Car and Killing a Person, Refusing to Accept the Sentence, Appealing for Acquittal

Zhuo Cichong, a native of Ningbo, 34 years old, who lives at No. 253 Zhao Zhujiao Road, French Concession, and runs a securities business in a company building, was driving his own car, No. 11918, along Avenue Edward VII, heading east to west, at 5:20 p.m. on August 1st of this year. Due to the driver's negligence, he hit Madam Chen Li, the wife of Cantonese man Chen Qin, who was walking in the same direction in front of the car, injuring her vital parts.

She died instantly. The police took the body to the coroner's office and reported it to the Second Special Court to send someone to examine it. The family collected the body, and Zhuo asked someone to mediate with the deceased's family and compensate them for the considerable damage. He also asked someone to request leniency from the authorities. However, the French police believed that Zhuo had not paid attention while driving, resulting in a major disaster, so they sent Zhuo to the Second Special Court. The French Concession authorities filed a public prosecution for negligent homicide.

The initial trial found the defendant Zhuo Cihui responsible for the crime and sentenced him to two years in prison. During the appeal period, he was allowed to post a substantial bail and be available on call. Zhuo refused to accept the verdict and hired a lawyer to file an appeal with the Third High Court.

### The Case of Murdering Father An, The French Police Released Details of the Case Yesterday

On the 30th of this month, Father An of the Tushanwan Catholic Church was suddenly strangled to death by bandits using ropes.

It is expected that the remaining members of the gang will be arrested soon.

The first defendant, Wu Zengfang, arrived with his defense lawyer and confessed that the plaintiff gave the money to Wang Shiying to purchase goods in Jiangbei. He was only a manager and issued a receipt. Everything was handled by the two of them. The plaintiff was very satisfied with the first batch of goods that arrived in Shanghai and asked them to purchase more. The latter batch of goods could not be transported to Shanghai, so someone was sent to manage them, costing more than 2,000 yuan in food and accommodation expenses, which led to disputes. Wang Shiying has gone to Kunming and has not returned. Please investigate. After reviewing the statements, the court decided to postpone the hearing to the 20th.

### Using a Hammer to Break Down the Door and Rob a Morphine Den, Owner Jumps from Building in Panic and is Injured

Korean Sun Wenze (31 years old) recently set up a morphine den in a pavilion room on the second floor of No. 81, Dakang Lane, Kang Ti Road, French Concession. It was unexpectedly raided by eight bandits at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. Three bandits guarded the door, and five went straight to the pavilion room. At that time, only Sun and his wife, Ms. Wang (Chinese), were in the room. Because the business was prohibited, the door was always closed. Seeing that the door would not open, the bandits used a hammer to break down the door and swarmed in. Seeing this, Sun jumped out of the window in panic and fell to the ground, suffering serious injuries. The bandits forced Sun's wife to open the iron box and robbed her of 2,000 yuan in cash. Afterwards, Sun, injured, reported the incident to the French police, who sent detectives to the scene. However, the bandits had already fled without a trace. They took Sun's wife to the police station for investigation and sent the injured man to the hospital for treatment.

### Letter

To the Editor: Regarding the news item in your newspaper's news column on the 10th of this month, "Daughter-in-law Hiding in Lawyer Yang's House," which is inconsistent with the facts, I hereby briefly state the following. According to Zhu Wangshi, around 2 p.m. on the 7th of this month, she first led a woman from Jiangbei to my house, and then went to the Xujiahui French Police Station to falsely accuse me of assault. After the police station investigated clearly, it was found that the incident stemmed from a previous grudge, and Song Wangshi was not present. The police station had no witnesses or injuries. I requested that she be charged with false accusation. The police chief advised me to settle the matter and drop the case. Unexpectedly, Song Wangshi, Song Wen, and his mother led thirty or forty hooligans, male and female, to break into my house around 7 p.m. on the same day. At that time, I was out and had not returned home. While Song Wangshi and the hooligans were causing a disturbance, Zhang Zhiqing and his daughter Shunbao were summoned by Mao Bentang of Xujiahui Catholic Church to call me. Song Wangshi and others immediately clashed with them and deliberately damaged my reputation. Subsequently, both parties were taken to the police station. After being released, they led hooligans, male and female, to Zhang Zhiqing's house around 10 p.m. on the same day, broke down the door and made trouble. Gang police then brought Song Wangshi, Zhang Zhiqing, and others to the police station and ordered them to be detained. At this time, Song Wangshi feigned injury and falsely accused me of assault, which is the truth. I hereby request your newspaper to publish it in the letter column to clarify the truth and avoid inaccuracies. Sincerely, Lawyer Yang Yiming, 28.9.10. To the Editor: After reading the section in your newspaper about the university professor accusing the lawyer of defamation, I found that the parties involved in this case, Zhang Guanghe, etc., found that the common ancestral grave site in Tushanwan was privately leased to Renyu Dyeing and Weaving Factory by Da Fang Yucang without authorization. After unsuccessful negotiations, the issue was resolved through legal means, and the lessee is still actively carrying out the work. The declaration published by the appointed representative is legally justified, and Zhang Yucang suddenly filed a criminal lawsuit, claiming that it was a false accusation, and even found that the lease was not disputed. Claiming that it was a false accusation, it cannot be specified as a slander. There is an intention to deliberately falsely accuse. It is hoped that your newspaper will clarify this issue. Sincerely, Lawyer Tang Yingsong, September 10.

### A Brief Discussion on Intellectuals

— Lin Chang

Intellectuals mostly come from the petty bourgeoisie or small landlord class. They lack a solid economic foundation but possess class characteristics. In terms of status, they are like ordinary petty bourgeois: easily able to climb up or fall down.

Because they possess knowledge, they are particularly sensitive in special times and societies, appearing with the most active stance. They can merge with the masses, yet in general situations, they unintentionally or intentionally reveal their inherent nature. In the long process, sometimes a burst of courage is difficult to sustain, so they will fall behind, decline, or even withdraw or rebel: Bukharin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Radek, weren't they the most respectable comrades at first? In the end, they all formed a different page in revolutionary history.

Petty-bourgeois intellectuals are also mostly prone to melancholy: looking at the upper class, they see extravagance and shamelessness, which are truly appalling, so they take the world as their responsibility and resolutely take on their sacred mission. Once they penetrate the ranks, they feel that others are too ordinary and crude, and they cannot perform their work satisfactorily, almost like Demosthenes on the battlefield. So they hesitate, waver, shed tears, lament, get angry, and become loners. However, they also value themselves too much – they have knowledge, are superior to ordinary people, and are uniquely blessed by heaven. Therefore, they often become psychological individualist heroes. Naturally, these heroes mostly lack the masses, so their power is weak. They are indeed too isolated, and a part of them, subjectively, act as the mainstay, possessing arrogance, disdaining to become "vassals" of the ruling class; their evaluation is "keeping themselves clean."

Putting oneself first is certainly seen as a good quality of intellectuals in general; intellectuals without ambition will even engage in vassal-like activities, like Jia Yucun in *Dream of the Red Chamber* reciting loudly: "Jade in the cabinet seeks a good price, Qin in the casket waits for the time to fly." Isn't this just the ideology of the feudal literati? Even now, some still hold such thoughts of fame and gain.

In this situation, lonely intellectuals must at least hold on to "keeping themselves clean," right? But intellectuals should have courage and faith and should not merely focus on "keeping themselves clean." Then they must also take a step further from "loneliness": Zhang Taiyan once used a large Dong Zhang as a fan pendant, went to the gate of the Presidential Palace, and loudly scolded Yuan Shikai for harboring evil intentions. This was truly an expression of blood and courage, enough to delight people's hearts! There was an objective effect. However, Zhang's power at that time was lonely; a thunderclap did not allow for a louder sound. Why? It may not have been because he was far from the masses.

Intellectuals should realize that their power must be invested in the ranks of the masses: breathing the breath of the masses, acting the actions of the masses. In this way, they will rationally overcome bad habits and lonely habits and create themselves as warriors of the times. It is good that they have Byron's sense of justice in fighting for freedom, and it is even smarter to have Barbusse's understanding of the wrongness of fighting for aggression. This is precisely the excellent and outstanding aspect of intellectuals.

Occasionally, one might think: "White herons fly before Mount Xisai, peach blossoms flow with plump mandarin fish," this is certainly also sensitivity; but the main thing is how to eliminate Feng Xuan's utilitarian view of a "no fish to eat, strumming the sword and chanting" bankrupt intellectual. If this kind of poison is fostered, one will eventually follow in the footsteps of "immortal Liaoyang."

In fact, it is undesirable for intellectuals to be too self-important and become individualists, and it is even more likely to bury themselves if they are too self-deprecating and become defeatists. Excellent, awakened intellectuals are often upright leaders of the masses. There are historical precedents for this: Sun Yat-sen and Ulyanov are two models. They are not "vassals" – helping and abetting evil – nor are they lonely, nor do they lack courage and faith, and these are indeed the most important conditions for intellectuals. It is because intellectuals have the latter two in a positive way that their ideals, feelings, and actions will coordinate and be common with everyone, so that they will not fall into a deep pit, be broken, or get into a dead end and be stifled.

### A Heroic Cook

— Sheng Dan

—War Zone Reminiscence—

On the way back, Dushan fell. This bad news reached Guanyindong, and everyone looked at each other blankly and felt a bit inexplicable. "How could it be lost so quickly?" It seemed to be an unanswerable mystery; because the fortifications on the front line were quite solid, and we had seen with our own eyes the courage of the defending soldiers to coexist with the position. Moreover, the terrain in the vicinity was very steep, with a commanding view. So, what was the reason for the fall? It is truly heartbreaking to say. When the enemy's plainclothes team had already appeared in Youfangdian, the self-defense corps guarding the northern hilltop was unprepared. When they woke up from their dreams, it was too late to "defend" themselves and they were completely wiped out. At the same time, the enemy also got the lead of the local ghosts, detoured in from the side, and the defending soldiers were caught off guard. Although they resisted desperately, they ran out of ammunition and were cut off from reinforcements, so they fulfilled their oath and completely sacrificed heroically. Only one cook survived. He took the gun from the hand of a dead comrade, fired the last bullet, and then crawled into the deep valley after his leg had been "colored." He was rescued by the people.

Therefore, the failure to defend the eastern front for a long time was first due to the inaction of the security team, and second due to the self-defense corps abandoning their responsibility. As for the ghosts willingly becoming accomplices, it was certainly also a fatal wound to the fall of Dushan. But we must not hide the reason why the ghosts were brought to the door, which was created by the self-defense corps. Their members were local ruffians, without training or discipline. As for the officers, most of them were "good fellows in the green forest." The so-called "sharing gold and silver in large scales" was the only central idea. The author dares not slander them. Such a counterfeit team not only cannot increase the strength of the war of resistance but also sometimes blurs the people's understanding of the enemy and ourselves, and weakens the driving force of military-civilian cooperation. General Liao Lei said: "The people's self-defense army in western Anhui must be thoroughly reorganized. In addition to military training, it is necessary to pay attention to political training, so that it can become a true people's armed force, and it will be able to shoulder the heavy burden of defending the hometown happily." General Liao's words were indeed realized later.

The day we met the cook, he was sleeping quietly in the hospital in the eastern suburbs of the mountain city. The wound had already healed, but his face was still pale, which was due to too much blood loss. After talking, we learned that his name was Zhang Caisheng, from Zhuoxian, Hebei. "Home? Please don't ask me about this! Before the devils withdraw from the country, I don't want anything, home, this tiring thing!" He replied indignantly, his eyes wide open. Then, he said that when the doctor allowed him to leave the hospital, he would go back to the team immediately to avenge his dead comrades.

"Okay, brave friend, I wish you eternal victory, goodbye!"

He smiled and stretched out a hard hand, shaking ours tightly.

Flower

In the early morning, I found a brilliant flower on my desk.

Who sent this flower?

Listening to the shouts of the flower girls passing through the deep alleys, I understood: the flower was sent by her.

In the past, I loved flowers, and I liked to smell the fragrance of flowers. Now, I have changed. A beautiful rose or a delicate jasmine cannot stimulate my heart.

The desk is messy: there are books, poems, and pens on display there. All of this seems too monotonous, and it is necessary to add a bunch of flowers to form a beautiful and harmonious pattern.

However, the flowers picked from the branches have lost their preciousness and rarity. They may have color, but they are not as bright red and lively as a drop of blood!

I am sure: fresh blood will definitely form beautiful wonders. It is the most precious thing in the world. If there is this on a monotonous case, then there will be vitality. So I hope someone can bring back a few flowers from the front line. I really want to be greatly inspired. I need to be filled with life.

I know I'm just dreaming: there's no such thing readily available in the world; the wonders of fresh blood must be created by brave warriors. Will it be sent to a lonely person as a desk decoration?

But I finally left a note outside the door; writing:

"Don't send flowers tomorrow."

Since then, the flower girl has come, only to return silently and without words.

Family Letter

Like a swallow skimming across the waves, a long-distance family letter cuts off a piece of longing.

Home, one word, one meaning, endless local accents from both places, separated by clouds, mountains, rivers, and seas, I have extreme joy.

Unable to see the face of my hometown, the letter says: the homeland has been ravaged, beacon fires are everywhere, and the fields have been turned into scorched earth under the railway. However, the mountains, the layers of peaks, flutter our great flag, the guerrilla队伍 is marching, everyone is struggling hard.

After reading the family letter, reluctantly, I read it until it was hot, not letting every word be easily forgotten. Perhaps, it seems that a poet once said: "A family letter is worth a thousand gold," now, I love reading this sentence very much, even if it is the price of ten thousand gold.

Remembering friends holding guns in the distance: Jin, Neng, Qi - they put on military uniforms, braved the wind and rain of eastern Guangdong, galloping in the fields of their hometowns, one head care, one gun! I wish them well, their health, the coming day of the hometown will certainly belong to us.

I will use infinite heat to repay the hard struggle of my friends, I want to work

Waiting again for the second family letter, looking up to the endless sky and sea...

### Farewell

— Iron Steel

Winter is gone and it's spring,

There is a vast wilderness there;

The torch of the liberation of the oppressed has spread all over,

The loud roar is shaking,

Tens of millions of people have gone to the front line.

Girl, only struggle can survive,

Love can only be eternal in struggle;

For the sake of hundreds of millions of people,

Also for the sake of our own love.

Goodbye, girl, tomorrow I will go to that desolate wilderness,

A short gun stuck in my waist,

Night raid as my speech,

The field replaces my classroom.

Goodbye, girl, don't forget me:

Remember how passionate I am to you,

Remember how calm I am to you,

I have no tears, I only have a fiery heart.

Tomorrow I will embark on the journey,

Girl, let me come again:

Our love is as firm as iron and stone forever.

### Two Anecdotes About Cui Lingzhi and Shisan Dan

— Yi An

—Both Actors Arrived in Shanghai at the End of the Qing Dynasty

Cui Lingzhi and Shisan Dan (Hou Junshan) were both famous Bangzi Dan actors thirty years ago. They have passed away for a long time, and it seems that there is no value in recalling them. However, when Cui and Hou were famous in the opera world, their sharpness was very strong, no different from today's Mei Lanfang. Li Chunke's "Yue Mantang Diary" records that the Minister of Internal Affairs of the capital, Wen Xi, hosted a banquet for Prince Gong until midnight and refused to stop. He insisted on summoning the Western actor Shisan Dan to perform two operas. He ordered the magistrate of Wanping to come quickly. Before he finished speaking, Shisan Dan arrived. Minister Wan immediately left his seat and sat on his knees in a flattering manner to greet him, saying, "Why are you so late? You almost offended your followers. Please don't be offended. Quickly put on your makeup to comfort the hungry and thirsty." The situation was like this. How could the court survive? We have nowhere to die. Li Chunke's feelings were like this, which can also prove that Shisan Dan was valued by the Qing court ministers. Another notebook records the story of Cui Lingzhi, saying that a certain Beijing official, a romantic seed, mistakenly thought Cui was a male actor disguised as a female, and invited many literati to a banquet in a restaurant. At the end of the banquet, the guests dispersed, but Lingzhi did not leave. The Beijing official wanted to flirt with her during the seat, but Cui slapped him in the face and left with a flick of his sleeve. The above two anecdotes will definitely be considered very interesting by opera fans.

Cui Lingzhi and Shisan Dan both came to Shanghai to perform before the Republic of China, and the only supporting roles I can remember are Ma Quanlu and Liu Zengyi. I don't dare to guess who else was a supporting role. Zuo Wansheng's "Pink Ink Gossip" records Shisan Dan: "Shisan Dan was famous for his beauty in Yantai. The people of the capital followed the trend and competed to fall in love with him. Officials and scholars often filled the seats. After returning to Shanghai by boat, he performed at the Dangui Teahouse. His Xin'an Station was really amazing. In a few months, he returned to the capital. Recently, there was a flying flower, and I don't know where it flowed to the end of the world. Alas, can I see him again?" According to the book "Pink Ink Gossip," its preface records that the year of Guangxu was the year of the strong prison Dayuan dedicated Zou month hope day. Because there was no Erya available on the case in the hotel, but Hou Junshan's arrival in Shanghai during the Guangxu period has indeed been seen in the writings of predecessors. Also, in the year of Xinhai, my friend Wang Jun Hanshen, who was old enough to be my father, fled from Hankou to my hometown, rented a house next to mine, and often talked to me about the affairs of the opera troupe after dinner. He was a member of the Banner, who had lived in Shanghai and Hankou for a long time, and told me that Cui Lingzhi performed his proud masterpiece Loyalty and Righteousness in Shanghai in a certain year (referring to before the Republic of China). Wang Jun said that he had never shed tears when listening to songs in his life, but he cried when he watched Cui perform. Shisan Dan seemed to have come to Shanghai again after the Republic of China. The place seemed to be Dangui First Stage. There are many senior opera fans in Shanghai. After seeing this article, they will definitely be able to indicate the year when the two actors came to Shanghai, which is also a proof of the stories of the opera garden.

### Zhang Yipeng and Jin Suqin Cooperate?

— Taibai

—Xindu Hotel Will Form a Ping Opera Theater

In the past two days, a strange news has been rumored outside - the news of Zhang Yipeng and Jin Suqin's cooperation.

Since Jin Suqin returned to Shanghai last month, she has lived in seclusion and rarely interacted with the outside world. One is that her jade body is unwell and she needs to rest, and the other is that Jin Suqin is reluctant to give up her original intention of improving Ping opera, and she does not have a satisfactory base in Shanghai to form a troupe temporarily. If Lin Shusen's Lin Opera Troupe is being re-staged, there was originally news of cooperation with Jin Suqin, but it ultimately failed to become a reality. So, where did the rumors of cooperation with Zhang Yipeng that have been circulating in the past two days come from?

It turned out that at the beginning of the opening of the Xindu Hotel, in addition to the Glass Radio Station and the Xiao Wenbin Shen Opera Theater, it was planned to organize a Ping opera theater with more appeal. Many opera troupe members had opened a "list" to the authorities, but it was either too ideal or the prestige was not enough. Recently, Monkey King Zhang Yipeng resigned from the stage at the Grand Theater. Zhang Yipeng has sung more than 30 "Journey to the West", leaving a deep impression on the audience's meninges in Shanghai, so perhaps someone moved his mind and also turned to Jin Suqin. If the two of them can cooperate, it is indeed very confident in the "business eye". But this is also an overly ideal plan, and the chances of it being realized are very small. However, it seems very urgent for the Xindu Hotel to organize a Ping opera theater now.

### Celebrities Acting in Spoken Drama? Who Says It Shouldn't Be Done?

— Xiao Yu

Many of the people who acted in the "Sunrise" stage play this time were friends from the screen, such as Lu Luming, Lan Lan, Zhou Manhua, Bai Yan, Shushi, Gong Jianong, Zhou Qi, Bai Yun and others. It is said that many comrades who specialize in spoken drama are a bit shaking their heads, thinking that [screen actors] are too free and too close to vulgarity, and that it is not advisable to use the title of "movie star" as a gimmick for spoken drama.

This is the reason, but it is only half of it. I think: spoken drama does not necessarily have to use movie stars as a gimmick, but once they become screen actors, they (she) must not lose their right to be on stage because of this. In short, for those who have acting talent, we do not have to discriminate against them regardless of whether they have been on the screen or not.

After watching "Sunrise", I feel that Lu Luming, Shushi, Gong Jianong, Zhou Youhua and others all have commendable stage acting skills, and the "screen newcomer" Lan Lan cannot be rejected because she has been on stage. This is my humble opinion.

Norma Shearer's new costume in the movie *The Women*, was designed by Adrian. The style is elegant, and the belt is inlaid with gorgeous lace, making her look lively and exquisite. This dress can very well highlight her beauty.

### Record of the Opening Ceremony of the New Chunqiu Opera School

— Chou Cheng

The New Chunqiu Drama School founded by Pan Wangji's daughter Qichuang held its opening ceremony on the ninth of this month. Because this kind of school is similar to the Beijing class and is rare in the South, I went to visit it, and I will record the trivial things I saw in this journal. The auditorium of the school is very well布置. On the wall hangs a silk plaque with red background and gold flowers given by Yu Tingsun, the director of the school, with the words "Promote Fine Arts" written on it. More than 30 students, such as Zhang Shunhua and Chen Liyun, are all energetic and happy. The three principals of Pan Wangji, He Zhiyang, and Chen Dabei (one formal and two deputy) and teachers Yan Gongshang and Li Junqing are sitting on the stage. Pan Wangji injured her throat due to a cold. In addition to distributing the school badges to the students, she did not speak. The words she wanted to say were all conveyed by the two vice principals. He said that the singing and acting skills of Ping opera are too old-fashioned and do not know how to improve. Everything about spoken drama has its drawbacks. The purpose of founding this school is to integrate the new and old dramas, take their essence, and discard their dross, so as to become a new type of opera that can be considered satisfactory by the top, middle and lower classes of the audience. I hope that the guests and students will all understand the good intentions of the organizers who love opera art. Chen's speech was quite long, so I will omit it. Yan Gongshang and Li Junqing also gave speeches one after another. A Mandarin teacher explained in detail the relationship between Ping opera and Mandarin. A screenwriter expert explained the psychology of screenwriting and actors, which was very moving. Finally, Wang Shensheng, a famous amateur actor, gave a speech, listing his own experience in Ping opera, spoken drama, and movies. He danced and gesticulated,突梯滑稽, vivid and colorful, no less than performing a one-man show. Everyone applauded, and then they went to the playground to take a photo and the meeting ended.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Afterwards, I researched with Xin Fang. I said that this person is too strange. He himself is famous in Tianjin as an amateur Qingyi singer of Erhuang. He is neither famous for the flute nor have I heard that he is proficient in Kunqu Opera. However, he is willing to take out money to train many flute masters and also support a Mr. Shen at home. This is really inexplicable! At that time, Xin Fang replied: "I once heard Zhou Wushi say that one of our colleagues (Kun troupe) once went to Guanwai. At first, he made a little money by getting some antiques, and supported his son to graduate from university. Now I heard that he has become a very big official and is very rich." After listening to Xin Fang's words, and carefully studying the high remarks made by a certain mayor at the table that day, we couldn't help but say in unison: "The so-called 某笛师 的 son, or else it is him."

Wang Keqin's Separation and Reunion with Zhang Xun

In the early years of the Republic of China, the military was domineering and formed a situation of carving out a territory. Zhang Xun was the most vocal and influential. He occupied Xuzhou for several years. The soldiers under his command were undisciplined and unruly, like a king of one side. Although the government issued orders, Zhang treated everything as a mere formality. Because he always remembered the Qing Dynasty, he staged the conference of military governors. Zhang moved to restore the Qing Dynasty. Wen Shengren (Kang Youwei) covered his face with a芭芜扇 to escape, and Wu Shengren hid in the Netherlands to avoid disaster. Zhang Xun himself was a rough person, but his only advantage was that he did not forget his roots. I have already told the story of him and the old Thirteen Dan. Just from this point, it can be seen that this person is very mindful of old friendships.

Lin Yutang Writes the Screenplay

### Shirley Temple's New Work "The Little Craftsman" Will Soon Be Completed

— Fu

—Released in China in October

Hollywood child star Shirley Temple looks very lively and cute. She has golden hair and blue eyes. She is ten years old this year. At the age of three, she appeared on the screen and starred in short films. Because of her excellent performance, she was reused and filmed feature films.

She is a powerful mainstay of Fox, and has acted in as many as nineteen films in five or six years. Each film is very profitable, so the company attaches special importance to her. The titles of her films mostly begin with the word "Little". Like "Little Miss Marker", "Little Miss Broadway", "Little Lord Fauntleroy", "Little Colonel", "Little Rebel", "Little Heidi" and the recently released "The Little Princess" and the colored film "The Little Princess" that has just been completed.

Following "The Little Princess", is "The Little Craftsman", which was specially written for her by Lin Yutang, a master of Chinese humor. The film started shooting in Hollywood last month and is scheduled to be completed within forty days. Probably in October of this year, the film will be released in China.
