### Southwestern Shanxi: A Frontline Inspection of Chinese Troops – Japanese Troops Only Occupy a Narrow Corner on Both Sides of the Tongpu Railway; Chinese Troops Strictly Defend the Plains, Farmers Continue to Cultivate as Usual

(Somewhere in Shanxi Province) The land occupied by the Japanese troops in southwestern Shanxi Province is limited to a narrow corner of less than five miles on both sides of the Tongpu Railway. They have never captured the entire plain. Even along the railway line, their control is only partially effective. After sunset, the Japanese troops rarely venture out, disturbing the Chinese troops outside the city and in the blockhouses.

I spent a day touring the towns and cities defended by the Chinese on the plains here. I met county magistrates and other officials, who were still working as usual, even though they were within range of Japanese artillery fire. The first line of defense of the Chinese regular army is set up at the foot of the mountains, and the Japanese troops have never extended their power to the edge of that area. I once climbed up to a Chinese military observation post on the mountain and saw the Fen River winding below. The Tongpu Railway is built in the river valley. A battalion commander led me to the top of the mountain, where we crawled into a small cave. Chinese soldiers were stationed here, using high-powered telescopes to observe the valley day and night to monitor the enemy's movements. Below the mountain was the plain, and a white line was faintly visible in the distance. The battalion commander said, "That is the Fen River." Looking east, the mountains were shrouded in morning mist, and the mountain scenery was hazy. The walled cities and winding roads, set against the green fields, were clearly visible. I pointed to the nearest city and asked, "Who occupies that city?" The guide replied, "Of course, our troops occupy it." I continued to point to several cities in succession and asked, and the answers were all the same. So I asked in surprise, "Then where are the Japanese troops?" The guide handed me the telescope and said, "Please look at that city (a city four miles away behind your hand)." About three hundred Japanese troops are stationed in that city. Our troops plan to attack it when there is a good opportunity." I then looked through the telescope in the direction he pointed and saw a slight flash of color above the city gate, which was the flag hung by the Japanese troops. The plain below the mountain was quiet, and the farmers were working diligently in the fields in the warm sunlight. Mules and donkeys were carrying goods, walking slowly on the road. This kind of peaceful atmosphere seemed incompatible with the rows of soldiers on the mountain. Moreover, the two sides were holding their positions, unyielding to each other, and it was difficult to discern the state of their arduous struggle. We decided to descend the mountain and enter the plain. We were very cautious along the way, because the mountain path we were passing through was within the range of Japanese observation, and they would occasionally fire artillery shells.

The first city we entered had no Japanese troops, but the atmosphere was very tense. The residents all seemed prepared to leave the city immediately if necessary. We rested for a few minutes in the city headquarters and saw that there were no bedding on the earthen beds (in northern China, every farmer's house has this kind of earthen bed, and they all sleep on it at night). The guide told me, "The soldiers here all wear leather jackets and sleep in their clothes. They carry nothing but their weapons, so they can respond to battle at any time." I was quite surprised that there were so few soldiers and relatively many strong men, and I asked the guide. He replied, "Everyone you see is a soldier. A large part of the soldiers in our army on the plains do not wear uniforms, so the Japanese troops cannot distinguish who is a soldier and who is a farmer. It is said that the Japanese troops have also tried to send plainclothes soldiers to sneak into the Chinese army's defense area, but without success, because the residents can tell at a glance who is a stranger."

When we were traveling on the plain, a local farmer served as our guide. He was also a soldier, and he had a short gun hidden under his clothes. We soon passed through a longer city three miles away. The city used to be quite prosperous, but now only eight hundred residents remain. As soon as we entered the city, the news of a foreigner's arrival spread throughout the city, and people came to see. Before long, I was surrounded by a crowd. They seemed very friendly. Some told me that I was the first foreigner to come here, but I didn't really believe it, because I had seen a small Catholic church here, and in the past, foreign missionaries must have come to that church.

### Japanese Troops in Zhaoguan Dam Have All Routes Cut Off; Traitor Liang Rongshun Executed

However, three artillery pieces were recently transported to Zhaoguan Dam, and two motorboats are parked in front of Hetang. The Japanese troops land during the day and return to the boats at night, totaling only about forty people. Their commander is Saito, and the headquarters is located in the Zhaoguan Dam Elementary School. There are five steel cannons and ten machine guns, but all the routes leading to Zhaoguan Dam have now been cut off by the Chinese troops, so the Japanese troops have lost contact.

Editorial

### The Need to Transfer Funds from the Concessions to the Interior Is Urgent

Since China implemented its war of resistance, the slogan "Funds should go to the interior" has long been proposed. Recently, the government has again expressed its request for the financial and industrial circles in the guerrilla areas, especially Shanghai, to invest in the southwest. The southwest is now the base for China's war of resistance and national reconstruction, and the development of various resources and the construction of transportation urgently require a large amount of funds. In addition, all economic activities in the areas currently occupied by the Japanese army are mostly under Japanese control. In order to avoid aiding the enemy, it is the bounden duty of the Chinese people to transfer funds to the interior.

In recent months, some of the industries in the guerrilla areas that had been destroyed by the war have resumed work under the name of "Sino-Japanese cooperation." The development of industry and commerce in the Shanghai concessions, which are in a so-called special environment, has surpassed the prosperity before the war. In the Japanese invasion plan, it was originally intended to use the occupied areas as a base for economic warfare against China. It can be asserted that the recovery of economic activity in the guerrilla areas was initiated and promoted by the Japanese side. As for the special prosperity of industry and commerce in the concessions, although it is said to be the free action of investors, this free action has indeed cast a very serious mistake. In addition to seeking direct control over the areas occupied by its armed forces, Japan also wants to indirectly control the concessions. It is using the prosperity of the concessions to reduce part of the burden of its invasion of China. This can be proved from the following facts.

At present, the most important economic activity in the concessions is commerce; and the focus of commercial activity is foreign trade. In the first two months of this year, China's foreign trade in and out of Shanghai accounted for about 50% of the total, and in and out of Tianjin accounted for about 22%. In form, most of this trade is no different from the past; however, the tariff revenue generated by this huge foreign trade has completely changed. It is estimated that from July of last year to the end of the year, the customs duties intercepted by Japan in North China and Shanghai reached 150 million yuan. Although the customs duties intercepted by Japan are nominally said to be used to repay China's foreign debt, in fact, they have neither been repaid nor become a special revenue in Japan's finances.

Moreover, most of the foreign trade in the concessions can be said to be trade with Japan. In the first two months of this year, China's trade with Japan accounted for 20% of the total foreign trade, ranking first in national trade. This is still tangible. The remaining intangible smuggling of Japanese goods is certainly greater than before the war, given the inability of customs in the occupied areas of China to strictly enforce anti-smuggling work. Moreover, under China's strict prohibition of trade with Japan, most of this trade with Japan can only be carried out in Shanghai, Tianjin and other ports. Not long ago, Viscountess Gladstone, chairman of the "No Silk, No Japanese Goods" Conference in London, said: "When we think of the price paid for the silk goods, which is the life of human beings, how can we bear to wear silk stockings, silk clothes, and silk ties!" People from friendly countries sympathize with China and are unwilling to buy Japanese goods. Why are the Chinese people engaged in commerce in the concessions instead disregarding everything and insisting on promoting Japanese goods, only seeking profit? Now, the buying and selling of Japanese goods in the concessions has open and normal market prices in the commercial columns of various newspapers. What a special and ridiculous phenomenon this is!

The industry in the concessions has also been relatively developed recently. However, the support of the enemy by industry is no different from commerce! Originally, if the raw materials needed by the industry were taken from the Japanese-occupied areas, extremely harsh taxes would have to be paid to the Japanese puppets; some simply used Japanese raw materials. For example, many small-scale weaving industries in Shanghai now mostly use Japanese yarn raw materials for the sake of low cost. However, the goods they produce are shipped to the interior, and they are beautifully called domestic goods! As for raw materials taken from foreign countries, tariffs must be paid. After the goods are made, pseudo-taxes must first be paid; and tariffs and other pseudo-taxes of various kinds must also be levied on exported raw materials. Although the total amount of these overlapping taxes is unknown, it must be considerable! It is estimated that the pseudo-unified tax alone in the concessions now collects about 7 million yuan per month. In addition to a portion being allocated to pseudo-organizations, most of it must be sent to the Japanese military's special service agencies. It can be seen that all industrial activities in the concessions have the suspicion of supporting the enemy.

Funds in various guerrilla areas have recently been gradually concentrated in the concessions. If this concentrated funds are used to take advantage of the consumption of millions of people in the concessions to make a little profit, it is indeed not a difficult task. However, from the perspective of national interests, this kind of economic activity inevitably and directly or indirectly supports the enemy. From the perspective of its own interests, given the impermanence of international affairs and the endless ambition of Japan, no one can guarantee that Shanghai will always be a safe place for funds. On the contrary, the interior is now the safest place to invest, and all economic construction has made rapid progress. Taking the industrial construction in the southwest alone, according to Chongqing news yesterday, from October of last year to March of this year, the government has newly established 12 large factories. The new factories established by overseas Chinese returning to China, as well as the factories moved from various provinces in Central China, should be at least more than 300. As for the development of commercial transportation, it has made most of China's foreign trade recently concentrated in Kunming and exported through the Southwest International Route. The government has also formulated incentive measures such as reducing and exempting taxes, transportation fees, and guaranteeing interest and granting loans for various industrial and commercial investments. Various European and American manufacturers and overseas Chinese have already gone to invest and operate. Then, the general fund owners in the concessions should also take this opportunity to transfer funds to the interior to help the government complete the economic construction work during the war.

### Chongqing Dagongbao Announces Conclusive Proof of Wang Jingwei's Treachery: Secret Agreement with Hiranuma to Promote Japanese Attacks on Changsha and Other Places, Requesting a Military Loan of 200 Million, Agreeing to Engage in Sabotage of National Resistance Policies

(Chongqing) Today's Dagongbao published in a prominent position the details of the secret agreement that Wang Jingwei had reached with Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma. It is said that this agreement contained the following points: (1) In order to facilitate the early realization of the peace policy of Wang Jingwei and former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, Japan should launch fierce attacks before the reorganization of the Central Government's army is completed, with the aim of achieving the following objectives: (a) The Japanese army in North China should occupy Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, surround Sichuan, and cut off Sino-Soviet transportation; (b) The Japanese army in South China should occupy Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Province, in order to suppress the anti-Japanese sentiment in that province, and should cut off transportation between Guangxi and Vietnam; (c) The Japanese army in Central China should occupy Changsha, cut off the Xiang-Gan Railway, and occupy Xiangyang and Fancheng to control the Xiang and Sichuan provinces; (2) When Japan completes the above procedures, Wang will personally lead the "Anti-Chiang and Anti-Communist War," and Wang guarantees that he can control at least 20 divisions of military force; (3) Wang will be responsible for organizing the Anti-Communist National Salvation League, serving as its president, with full administrative power to eliminate all anti-Japanese and communist elements; (4) Discuss the agreement on restoring peaceful and friendly relations between China and Japan. This agreement should be based on the anti-communist principle and the Konoe-Wang Declaration, and should adopt the views of all anti-communist groups; (5) In order to realize the second and third points, Japan should give Wang 3 million yuan per month. Former Director of the Asian Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gao Zongwu, took these proposals and arrived in Tokyo on February 20, meeting with Hiranuma several times and agreeing on the following specific agreements: (1) When the Japanese army occupies Nanning, Changsha, Yichang, Shashi, Xiangyang, Fancheng, and Xi'an, Wang will issue another declaration, changing his previous policy of appealing to Chiang Kai-shek to start peace talks, and come forward to handle the overall situation himself. However, Japan must complete its part of this process in May or June. In order to overthrow the National Government, Wang ordered Japan to send troops from Xiangfan to Hanzhong, and another route from Nanchang, via Changde and Guiyang, to Sichuan, and should launch a main attack in this area. Japan has already allocated 2 million yuan to Wang twice. Wang also suggested that if Japan sends troops to land and occupies Fuzhou and Chaozhou, he will establish a southwest government. When Japan's military operations expand, he can gradually disintegrate the Chinese resistance army. Wang's "basic demands" are as follows: (1) Abolish the Nanjing "Reformed Government" and the Beiping "Provisional Government"; (2) Establish a new National Government in Nanjing; (3) Establish the Anti-Communist National Salvation League; (4) Allocate 3 million yuan per month for expenses; (5) Maintain 12 divisions of troops as the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army; (6) Military budget loan of 200 million yuan; (7) Conclude an agreement with Japan based on the Konoe Declaration; (8) In international relations, China should maintain friendly relations with Germany, Italy, Britain, and the United States; (9) China should join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Dagongbao claimed that the detailed report of this "secret agreement" was obtained by the Chinese authorities from a Xie, a Japanese translator. The report also confirmed that Wang issued another declaration in Hanoi on March 31, again urging peace and claiming that the central government wanted to end the war but did not dare to say it. Dagongbao also published an editorial on the "secret agreement," believing that the Chinese government has been too lenient with Wang and his clique and should severely punish this kind of traitor. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)

(Chongqing) The detailed report of the "secret agreement" signed between Wang Jingwei and Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma reported in the newspaper has shocked all circles of Chinese people here. Just the publication of this news alone is worthy of great attention, because previously, the Chinese government authorities hoped that Wang could eventually be persuaded to abandon his peace policy and return to the embrace of the Kuomintang, so it strictly prohibited the publication of any news and criticism of Wang. Now that the ban has been lifted and the matter is allowed to be published, it clearly indicates that the central government has truly abandoned Wang and changed all hope for his attitude. It also indicates that there is no longer any possibility of cooperation between the central government and Wang. A Reuters reporter learned that many recent developments have caused the government to change its attitude towards Wang. Now, it is learned that these developments are as follows: (1) Wang and his clique continue to negotiate with the Japanese side, and they have been carried out publicly several times, which has caused the Chinese government authorities to abandon hope for Wang; (2) Wang published a declaration on April 1, disclosing secret documents, and threatened to continue to publish them in the future. This move infuriated the central government authorities, believing that unless Wang is willing to be a complete traitor, he has no right to disclose state secrets. The general public here believes that the central government will soon discuss and announce strict methods of punishing Wang and his clique, or will order their arrest and punish them according to law.

### The Zhe-Gan Railway Has Already Been Demolished

(Chongqing) Jiangxi Provincial Chairman Xiong Shihui said that the Chinese army had demolished the railway between Zhejiang and Jiangxi before withdrawing from Nanchang, so the Japanese army still could not rely on the railway to control the area. The destruction of the railway line "prevents the large-scale inflow of foreign goods." The so-called foreign goods should refer to the inflow of Japanese goods from Zhejiang ports. The inability of foreign goods to flow in can increase the output of domestic goods. The government has been promoting domestic goods through cooperatives and industrial public bonds in the past few months. (Associated Press dispatch on the 5th)

### Britain and Poland Agree on Mutual Assistance Treaty: May Sign Today; France Also Strengthening Relations with Russia

(London) Well-informed sources in Poland here recently declared that when the country's Foreign Minister Colonel Beck held talks with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax last night, a compromise was reached in principle, or a mutual assistance treaty will be signed tomorrow morning. The content should include a public declaration and a secret protocol, with all implementation measures contained in this protocol. Prime Minister Chamberlain is said to have promised to assist Poland in expanding its military equipment in order to cope with all unexpected events. Foreign Minister Beck also consulted with experts from the British Treasury last night on the issue of British loans. Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression alliance, Poland is still unwilling to participate at the same time as the Soviet Union, and it does not want to form an agreement with the Soviet Union alone, as this may be regarded by Germany as an intentional provocation. However, Poland welcomes it if Britain and the Soviet Union form an agreement. In addition, regarding the relationship between Poland and Romania, Foreign Minister Beck still insisted on his own opinion, saying that if several countries are attacked by Hungary, Poland, because of its friendly relations with Hungary, is unwilling to intervene. Although British cabinet members have tried to persuade him, they have been unsuccessful. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)

(London) According to official sources, since Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck arrived in London, Anglo-Polish talks have made satisfactory progress. The consultations were quite long today and will continue tomorrow. Colonel Beck, accompanied by Ambassador Lechenski to the UK, went to the British Foreign Office this morning to meet with Foreign Secretary Hallifax and others. The British Foreign Secretary then hosted a luncheon, attended by Churchill, Eden, and others. Colonel Beck later met with the British Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister for about two hours at the British House of Commons. The content of the talks is currently kept secret by officials. According to responsible sources, the safety curtain has now been lowered, and the curtain will be raised when the performance begins. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

(Paris) Responsible sources here recently declared that regarding the organization of an anti-aggression alliance, the French and Soviet governments are conducting talks through diplomatic channels in order to prepare for Soviet cooperation. Before discussing cooperation with the Soviet Union, Britain should strive to reach agreements with Romania and Poland. Regarding this matter, although Moscow issued a semi-official communique yesterday, saying that the Soviet Union had not promised to supply military materials and raw materials to Poland and Romania, people here still say that the Soviet Union is doing this to increase its own value, so that the countries know the importance of Soviet cooperation. In fact, it is almost certain that the country will participate in the collective security system. Judging from the fact that Foreign Minister Bonnet has been talking with Soviet Ambassador Suritz for several days, it is known that the two sides are actively negotiating. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)

(London) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck went to the House of Commons at 5 pm today to talk with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax for two hours. He then visited former Foreign Minister Eden at his private residence. Responsible sources declared that today's talks had a "commercial" flavor, and the progress was very satisfactory. Foreign Minister Beck has already agreed to accept mutual restrictions, but the restrictions accepted by the Polish side must be appropriately limited due to geographical conditions. For example, Poland will not go to war to defend the Suez Canal, which is one example. In addition, Foreign Minister Beck also made some explanations regarding the mutual relations between Poland and Romania. Generally speaking, although Poland has an obligation to help Romania, if Romania is attacked by Hungary, Poland, because of its friendly relations with Hungary, does not want to intervene. In this situation, Britain and France may directly give guarantees to Romania, which is also certain. However, no concrete decision has been made at this time. Foreign Minister Beck will continue to discuss the Romanian issue when he continues talks with the British authorities tomorrow. Other issues, such as the Polish Jewish issue and the British loan to Poland, will also be discussed. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)

(London) The talks conducted by the diplomatic authorities of Britain and Poland have recently been commented on by various newspapers here. The Daily Mail reported that Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck told the British authorities that Hungary is not necessarily in cahoots with Germany and can still be won over, and that the Soviet Union occupies an important position in the future collective security system, so the British and Soviet authorities must thoroughly exchange opinions. The News Chronicle reported a Berlin message saying that German leader Hitler met with experts yesterday to draft a plan to deal with the British encirclement. The Manchester Guardian reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on March 31 failed to make Hitler understand, which is well known to the British side. Therefore, what kind of actions Hitler will take is attracting attention from all sides. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)

(London) When the House of Commons was in session yesterday afternoon, opposition Liberal Party member Mandel asked the government, "The staff headquarters of our country and the new allied countries have not yet held talks and established close contact. Is this appropriate? Does the government consider this?" Army Minister Belisha immediately replied, "Yes, everything is under consideration." Mandel also asked whether the government intends to send Lieutenant General Gort, the Chief of the General Staff of the Army, to visit Poland and the Soviet Union. Belisha replied no. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)

(London) Well-informed sources in political circles recently declared that the Cabinet discussed this morning the possibility of Italy and Spain jointly attacking British Gibraltar and French Morocco. The reason is that Italian troops landed in Spanish ports again a few days ago, and news also came from Burgos, Spain, that Germany is pressuring General Franco, commander-in-chief of the National Army, to sign a military alliance treaty with the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact, which shows that Germany and Italy are trying to encircle France in response to Britain's attempt to encircle Germany. Therefore, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's recent statement that "Italy is unwilling to be confined to the Mediterranean" can be answered here. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)

### British Ambassador to Germany to Return to Post

The Vatican authorities are also considering various preventative measures, which is unprecedented for the Holy See. It is understood that the Pope and his staff, if necessary, plan to take refuge in the basement built by Nicholas V (the name of a deceased Pope). The walls there are approximately three to five meters thick, and the Papal Palace is built above it. In addition, a domed hall was fitted with steel armor several months ago, and a portion of the Vatican's treasures has already been stored there. According to experts, this hall is very sturdy and cannot be destroyed even by the most powerful bombs. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

He is scheduled to return to Paris tomorrow to continue discussions with experts from the British and French air ministries.

Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied, "I cannot be certain if this is indeed the case and therefore cannot confirm any dates, which I regret. The only information we have received is that there was a rotation of Italian troops during the ongoing Spanish Civil War." Opposition Labour MP Fletcher asked, "Has the British government instructed its ambassador to Spain, Sir Maurice Peterson, to mention to Franco the promise he previously made that once the civil war ended, he would withdraw all German and Italian troops and their armaments?" Under-Secretary Butler replied, "Ambassador Peterson and the government are currently closely monitoring the situation, taking into consideration General Franco's previous declarations.

### British First Lord of the Admiralty's Remark Causes Stir in Poland British Fleet Always Prepared for War Admits Oversight and Apologizes

(London) The remarks made yesterday by First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Stanhope, except for the Daily Telegraph and Morning Post, were published by all other newspapers in a sensational manner. Because the naval authorities requested the newspapers not to publish them in the interest of national security, the public paid even more attention to them. The impact of this incident may even lead to a political storm. Opposition Labour leader Greenwood has indicated that he intends to raise this matter in the House of Commons. The Liberal News Chronicle reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain was deeply regretful of these remarks, and Earl Stanhope's continued service has become a question. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

(London) First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Stanhope made astonishing remarks yesterday evening while attending a banquet on the battleship "Oak," stating, "Certain gentlemen should have been at the banquet, but were unable to do so due to official duties. Just before I left the Admiralty to come here, I had to issue orders to send gunners to the anti-aircraft gun positions on various warships to prepare for any eventuality. Taking this ship as an example, before you guests arrived, all sixteen anti-aircraft guns were ready and prepared to give a warm welcome to anyone who dared to invade." When asked what he meant, he replied, "The navy fleet should always be on strict alert, so as to be prepared for any eventuality." Afterwards, Reuters notified all newspapers not to publish the story. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

(London) Acting Labour leader Greenwood spoke in the House of Commons this afternoon, requesting Prime Minister Chamberlain to explain why the government had formally requested the press not to publish the First Lord of the Admiralty Stanhope's instructions regarding the use of anti-aircraft guns on the fleet. The Prime Minister replied that Stanhope's remarks were not pre-considered and denied that he had requested a special publication. Stanhope had drawn attention to the fact that when he gave the speech on the HMS Ark Royal, there were not many listeners, because some personnel had remained on their respective ships to man the gun positions. This is common practice during times of great tension. The Prime Minister had personally requested newspapers not to publish Stanhope's remarks, or if they did, not to give them special emphasis, because the Prime Minister anticipated that readers might view them with alarm. The Prime Minister also admitted that Stanhope had made a slip of the tongue and stated that the navy had not issued any new orders. He concluded by saying that Stanhope had expressed his apologies for causing unnecessary panic with his remarks. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

It is said that Earl Stanhope's speech on the battleship "Oak" last night may cause a political storm. Regarding this matter, Earl Stanhope met with Prime Minister Chamberlain for a long time before this morning's cabinet meeting, and it is said that he stated that the so-called British fleet should always be prepared for war was not aimed at any particular event.

The Social Republican Union (i.e., the party led by former Prime Minister Flandin) has decided to allow its members to vote freely. The right-wing Republican Federation (i.e., the party led by Marin) supports President Lebrun's re-election. The Socialist and Communist parties have decided to nominate "symbolic" candidates to compete with President Lebrun and the other candidate, former Minister of Justice Godart. The Socialist candidate is leading party figure Bedos, and the Communist candidate is party Senator Cachin.

### U.S. House Forms Committee to Review Neutrality Act Amendments Fourteen Proposals in Total Discussions to Begin on the 11th

(Washington) The House Foreign Affairs Committee today appointed seven members to form a committee to review the Neutrality Act amendments. It is scheduled to begin reviewing opinions from all sides on April 11. It is estimated that Assistant Secretary of State Welles will be the first to present his views. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

(Washington) Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, the House Foreign Affairs Committee has received fourteen amendment proposals. The House has decided to conduct an investigation starting on the 11th of this month to gauge public opinion. In addition, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to hold a public meeting tomorrow to study the amendment issue. At that time, prominent figures from all walks of life, especially representatives from pacifist groups and foreign policy research groups, will attend and express their opinions. Former Secretary of State Stimson is among them. He recently stated that all civilized countries should unite to eliminate the scourge of war and prevent Germany from dominating the world. Observers here have stated that President Roosevelt's basic proposition is that all countries threatened by Nazi imperialism should unite. British Prime Minister Chamberlain endorsed this proposition in his speech in the House of Commons yesterday. In view of this, the majority of members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are expected to change their original position on the issue of amending the Neutrality Act and support the government. They also believe that Congress should make a decision as soon as possible, as the current Neutrality Act will expire on May 1st and the European situation is extremely serious. If the United States amends the Neutrality Act after the outbreak of war, it could be seen by one of the belligerent parties as an unfriendly act, which is not appropriate. As for the views of the committee members, they can be divided into three factions. The first faction believes that the United States government should pursue an absolutely affirmative policy, distinguishing between aggressor and victim, and abolish the current Neutrality Act entirely or attach amendments to it, allowing the United States government to immediately state its position within a new collective security system. This faction has been endorsed by the White House and the State Department, but may not publicly support it. The second faction, the isolationist and pacifist faction, believes that the current Neutrality Act should be maintained or even strengthened, saying that the United States should not interfere in European affairs and that even if war breaks out in Europe, it will not threaten U.S. security. The third faction takes a moderate stance between the above two factions, meaning that if war breaks out in Europe, all countries in the world will be threatened, but the United States should not accept definite restrictions at this time, but can only expand the scope of the current Neutrality Act. This proposition is in line with the views of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman. Pittman's proposed amendment advocates extending the "cash and carry" clause from various raw materials to armaments. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### Albania Negotiating with Italy

(Rome) According to a broadcast message from the Italian radio station in Bari, the rumors about relations between Italy and Albania are completely unfounded. In fact, at the clear request of Albanian King Zog I, Italy and Albania are conducting talks to strengthen their mutual defense alliance. The Italian government has no intention of undermining Albania's independence and integrity. According to observations here, Britain intends to inquire with Greece and Yugoslavia about their opinions on the anti-aggression front. Italy is courting Albania as a countermeasure. If Italy occupies Albania, it can make Greece and Yugoslavia realize the necessity of maintaining good relations with the Berlin-Rome Axis, and Italy can have no worries in the Adriatic Sea. However, Italy's occupation of Albania will inevitably create a bad impression on Yugoslavia, because after Germany annexed the provinces of Czechoslovakia, the tide of Pan-Slavism has already risen, and many people have turned their attention to Britain's anti-aggression plan. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

### Truth about the Murder of British Consul in Iraq Consulate also Burned Down

(London) According to official sources here, the British Consul in Mosul, Iraq, Mason, was shot and killed by a mob after the announcement of the news of the death of Iraqi King Ghazi I.

As a result, the crowd became angry and killed the British Consul Mason and set the consulate on fire to vent their anger. The four perpetrators have been arrested and will be tried by a special court. Upon hearing the news, Iraqi Prime Minister Said went to the British consulate to apologize to the British Chargé d'Affaires, saying that he was shocked by the incident. It is said that Mosul has declared martial law, and order was restored within a few hours. According to a Reuters dispatch, British Consul Mason, upon hearing the shouting of the crowd outside the consulate, intended to come out and stop them, but as soon as he reached the steps of the consulate, the crowd threw stones at him, causing his death. The previous report that he died from a gunshot wound was inaccurate. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

The Under-Secretary also responded to a question from National Conservative MP Maughan, stating that new regulations issued in North China at the behest of the Japanese government stipulate that, starting from March 11, most exports from North China will not be allowed to proceed unless the foreign exchange earnings are sold to the Federal Reserve Bank at a price of 14 pence to exchange for banknotes issued by that bank. According to what Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax knows, the impact of these regulations has brought foreign trade in Tianjin and other parts of North China to a complete standstill.

### After the Nazi Annexation of Czechoslovakia

1.

Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper: The Republic of Czechoslovakia has been sold by the two democratic criminals of England and France to the Pharisees, and now it has been nailed to the cross, bleeding to death. Czechoslovakia is sacrificed, Chamberlain's so-called "peace" is maintained, and Nazi Germany's desires are temporarily satisfied. However, the remaining question is still not whether the democratic countries and fascists can coexist peacefully, but rather whether the endless desires of the fascist countries will be satisfied once again, launching another attack on weak nations, and threatening democratic countries again, to achieve their goal of "winning without fighting." Since the Austrian incident in March last year, and the Czech incident in September last year, Hitler has known how to use the Fascist traitors in Austria and Czechoslovakia to incite political turmoil, which has yielded greater results than using military force at great cost. Since the Munich Agreement, Hitler has become even more adept at using this expedient method.

Although Czechoslovakia was nominally still an independent country after the Munich Agreement, in reality, it had already become a vassal of Germany. Not only was its diplomacy controlled by Berlin (as the Czech Foreign Minister Chvalkovský once said, "The Czech diplomatic policy should be like a mouse, and there should be no inconsistencies with Germany"), but also all its internal affairs were subject to German interference. Under German instructions, Czechoslovakia had long implemented anti-Semitic policies. In terms of cultural policy, the Czech national pioneer, Jan Hus, the founder of the Hussite sect, has been regarded by the Nazis as the leader of the opposition to the German Reformation, and his activities have been banned, while Wenceslaus IV, the Germanic (but not actually Germanic) King of Bohemia, has been used to replace him. The Fascist's vicious policy of destroying national cultures after destroying national states is fully manifested here.

The Nazi advance into Czechoslovakia was not only to make the Czech people slaves of Germany forever in terms of culture, but also to use Czechoslovakia as a hub for invading Eastern European countries in terms of military affairs. The highway through Moravia, a province of Czechoslovakia, must be used for German military purposes. The specific purpose of this road is to allow German troops and their supplies to quickly reach Vienna from Breslau in Germany in the event of a German war of aggression. In terms of waterways, Czechoslovakia was forced to contribute 200 million crowns for the development of the Danube-Oder Canal, for the convenience of German military use. In terms of railway transportation, Germany acquired 20,000 freight and passenger cars and 800 locomotives from Czechoslovakia in one fell swoop after the Munich Agreement. Germany also demanded that the Czech government transfer the navigation rights of the Elbe River. As for heavy industry, Germany exerted pressure on the famous Czech arms factories Škoda and Zbrojovka Brno, forcing them to transfer ownership. As a result of this German annexation of Czechoslovakia, there is no doubt that Germany confiscated the Czech arms factories for its own use. Recent news has already told us that Germany has gained great benefits from annexing Czechoslovakia, not only obtaining a large number of the best armaments, sufficient for the use of forty divisions of the most modernized army, and obtaining a large amount of raw materials for German industrial development, but also obtaining 25 million pounds of cash from the Czech treasury, and potentially obtaining another 10 million to 20 million pounds of cash from other sources. In addition, 700,000 textile machines and all other means of production in Czechoslovakia fell into German hands. Even Tomáš Baťa, the most famous Czech shoe magnate, could not stand his ground in the country and fled to Romania. It is unknown how many other people who were oppressed by the Nazis and could not live peacefully in Czechoslovakia. To date, as many as 5,000 innocent Czech people have been sent to concentration camps by Hitler. The speed of Czechoslovakia's demise and the severity of the suffering are truly unprecedented in history. From this, we can prove that those who advocate compromise and surrender in order to maintain "a portion of their strength" are the most foolish people in the world. Chvalkovský, the Czech Foreign Minister who could not make a mouse-like move against Germany, and Hácha, the Czech President who personally went to Berlin to kowtow, still could not prevent Czechoslovakia from suffering the pain of national subjugation. After such a cruel satire has reached those traitors theorists of ours who advocate "complete peace," I wonder if their stubborn brains have been moved at all?

2.

Czechoslovakia has become a historical term. What will be the Nazi's next target of attack? Romania? Lithuania? Or the Western European democracies?

We know that the Nazi philosophy of Czechoslovakia is fundamentally incompatible with democracy. On March 14, 1936, Hitler said in Munich: "Until all nations achieve the same laws and legal systems, we do not believe that there can be peace between nations. That is why I hope that National Socialism will one day spread throughout the world. This is not a ridiculous dream, but an achievable goal." This means that Hitler wants to extend his tyranny, aggression, and bloody rule to the whole world, and use the Nazi slave doctrine to bind the free nations of the world. Although this is an exaggerated and shameless rant, it cannot be ignored. He has repeatedly challenged the Western European democracies and repeatedly pursued his policy of aggression. At the same time, due to the weakness of the Western European democracies, he has seized many benefits. His basic policy towards Europe is outlined in his book "Mein Kampf," which is the so-called "territorial policy," that is, the policy of expansion in Europe. The annexation of Austria and the destruction of Czechoslovakia are all starting points for this policy. Now, the Nazi target is naturally focused on the small countries in East-Central Europe, because this is the weakest link that is most connected to Germany. At the same time, Hitler has deeply understood the psychology of the Western European democracies, knowing that if he attacks these countries, England and France will not exert any pressure that can stop his aggression. What was the reaction of the Western European democracies after Hitler took Czechoslovakia without firing a shot? Chamberlain only issued some weak calls that could not even scare away mosquitoes, saying that "Britain has no separate responsibility to guarantee the new borders of Czechoslovakia," which is good proof. France, on the other hand, blindly follows Britain. It would be an illusion to think that the European situation could be changed under Chamberlain's leadership.

Of course, after Germany swallows Czechoslovakia, it needs a considerable amount of time to pacify, organize, and digest this new territory. This will naturally give the Western European countries a very short respite. But this opportunity will not last long. At most three months, Hitler's sword will point directly to Western Ukraine. The so-called Western Ukraine is located in the Carpathian Mountains, in the area between Czechoslovakia and Poland. It has an area of 48,000 square miles, almost equal to one-third of the territory of Poland, with a total population of 9 million, of which 7 million are Ukrainians. In this area, there are two oil-producing centers, one is Drohobycz and the other is Boryslav. These two places are of great importance to future German military aggression, both strategically and in terms of raw material supply. Because it is these two places that can produce 600,000 tons of oil annually, and there is potential for increase if further developed. In addition, this place can also serve as a base for threatening Poland and attacking the Soviet Union.

Like other parts of Central and Eastern Europe, this area already has deeply organized Nazi Party members, absorbing all local reactionaries, receiving instructions from Berlin, and serving Germany as henchmen. German Nazis have absorbed some members of the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance into their ranks, and want to exploit the dissatisfaction of Western Ukrainian peasants with Polish landlords to achieve their goal of inciting unrest. This vicious tactic of the German Nazis is the same as the one used in the Sudetenland. They first incite the dissatisfaction of a few farmers with the Polish ruling class, and then use it as an excuse for Nazi aggression, to strike Poland and reap the benefits.

In the case of Czechoslovakia, they incited Hungary to seize Subcarpathian Rus', which also belongs to the Ukrainian nation, so that Hungary's borders could connect with Poland. Now Hungary's plan has been realized, and Subcarpathian Rus' has fallen into the hands of Hungary. The division of Czechoslovakia has come to an end. Germany's instigation of Hungary to do this is not out of love for Hungary, but in reality Hungary is already a vassal of Germany, used by Germany, so it is using such a piece of candy to sweeten its mouth. Moreover, if Germany attacks Poland, Romania, or the Soviet Union in the future, it can pass through Hungary, or even take it over and redistribute it, to facilitate its military operations, which is not impossible.

3.

Therefore, since the fall of Czechoslovakia, Hitler's various activities tell us that the Nazi's second target of attack may be Western Ukraine. In other words, the second victim behind Czechoslovakia may not be Romania, but Poland. Although German Göring once said, "After we solve Czechoslovakia, it will be your (Romanians') turn." However, Hitler's usual trick of using internal spies to cause internal strife in order to profit from it has failed in Romania. The assassination of the leader of the Romanian Iron Guard, King Carol II's iron-fisted suppression of domestic rebels instructed by Berlin, and Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's statement that Romania cannot tolerate foreign interference, all prove that the Nazis cannot manipulate Romanian politics except by force. An early use of force against Romania is not yet the time, as Czechoslovakia has just been acquired and needs to be organized and rested, and it is not as cost-effective as using National Socialist Party members to incite internal strife. In addition, as a result of the Romanian king's visit to Britain last year, he received a large sum of money from Britain. The Anglo-Romanian relations are extremely close, and the Anglo-Romanian economic relations are also extremely important. After Germany occupied Czechoslovakia, the British believed that Romania was a major pillar in the East to prevent Germany from reaching the Caspian Sea and defend against Nazi aggression. The British want to use economic power to buy Romania, just as the Germans want to use credit loans to buy Romania as their assistant. Over the years, Germany has been Romania's largest customer for agricultural products. The German IG Chemicals company has signed a treaty with Romania to obtain the exclusive right to export Romanian soybeans. For this reason, Romania has to purchase a large number of German industrial products in exchange. The credit loans that Germany has lent to Romania in the past five years have reached 100 million lei (approximately 1.5 million pounds, Lei being the currency). Such loans naturally give Germany great power over the Romanian economy. And what Germany intends to achieve in the Romanian economy is this bloodless success of aggression. Last year, the visit of German Nazi figure Dr. Funk to Bucharest, the capital of Romania, was aimed at making Romania an economic vassal of Germany. But this plan ultimately failed. Last year, Germany offered a high price to buy a large amount of Romanian wheat, which was not accepted by Romania, and Romania was willing to sell it to the British market at a lower price. After Germany annexed Czechoslovakia in March of this year, it once again made an economic ultimatum to Romania in Sino-German trade negotiations, demanding that Romania (1) abandon industrialization and remain in the agricultural stage forever, and (2) give Germany the exclusive right to all Romanian exports, such as oil, grain, timber, livestock, and food. This has been rejected by the Romanian authorities, but in order to appease Germany, commercial negotiations are still underway. All this can prove that Germany's bloodless policy of aggression cannot succeed as it wishes. Germany will naturally not relax its plans in this regard, and will inevitably become more active.

4.

Looking at the situation in Eastern Europe as a whole, we can say that after annexing Czechoslovakia, what Germany Nazi's bloody hands want to seize, and what is most convenient from the point of view of the situation, is Western Ukraine—a part of Poland's territory—which can be directly extended from Czechoslovakia. In this place, there are activities of Nazi Party members, conspiracies of Ukrainians inclined to the Nazis, the instigation of the Hungarians, the organization of the German Stormtroopers' armed forces, and the supply of Hitler's large amount of money and arms. It is a good opportunity for Hitler to fish in troubled waters and pick chestnuts out of the fire. Fortunately, the lesson of the Nazi destruction of Czechoslovakia has given all the people of Southeast Europe a factual lesson. According to recent news, small countries in Southern Europe, such as Romania, Greece, and Turkey, are planning to form a group to jointly deal with the Nazi advance into the East. (King Carol of Romania and Prime Minister Călinescu have both expressed to Britain that if Romania is subjected to aggression in the future, if England, France, and the Soviet Union can come out to help, then Romania can guarantee to invite a united front of Poland, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia to cooperate in dealing with the aggressor. This new situation in Eastern Europe is worthy of our attention. In the future, the key to the Eastern European issue lies in whether the Western European democratic powers can harden their stance to lead these countries and give the Nazi Party's offensive a major blow, so as to maintain peace in Europe and the entire world.

### Reader Submission: Discussion of Methods for Preventing Floods in Northern Jiangsu in Relation to the Breaching of the Yellow River at Huayuankou and Zhaokou

—(Fei Zhujun, Dongtai)

The blessings and misfortunes of the unpredictable cannot be discerned by the wise, but the obvious advantages and disadvantages can be known by the foolish. It is difficult to avoid all disasters even when the Huai River flows into the sea alone, but if the Yellow River seizes the Huai River, the embankments will surely breach, causing the nine counties downstream to be flooded like cauldrons, with towns becoming swampy countries and villages turning into vast oceans. If people and livestock drown, and fields and houses are swept away, then the people of the nine counties, according to a survey by the Ministry of Industry of the Republic of China in 1932 on international trade, totaling nearly ten million, will either become food for fish and turtles or turn into miserable wailing. The products of the nine counties, according to Zhang Nantong's words of gratitude for soliciting donations in 1922, based on the calculation of 11,735,569 mu of farmland in each county, average a total harvest of 24,637,958 dan (Zhang's calculation excludes the very small parts of Funing and Huaiyin). If the wind and waves rage, it will be difficult to harvest a single grain of rice. Today, in provinces such as Yunnan, Hunan, Sichuan, and Jiangxi, there are only more than one million refugees from military disasters. The central government's relief methods involve activities such as reclamation and gold panning. Regulations are frequently issued, and the distribution is very busy. Furthermore, taking Shanghai, our country's only commercial port with a population of four million, as an example, it has always been a bustling urban area where Chinese and foreigners live together. There are a total of 100,000 refugees, and the supply of expenses requires more than 300,000 per month, which is also difficult to raise. If the counties downstream unfortunately experience overwhelming floods, where will the millions of refugees who escape from death be placed? There is no way to accommodate them, no land to reclaim, and no funds to provide for them. Even if charitable organizations work hard to solicit donations, and benevolence and righteousness provide a steady stream of relief, it will ultimately be a drop in the ocean, and distribution will be impossible. Then the cries of hunger and the sight of starving people will be heartbreaking and everywhere. With even a little compassion, there are unimaginable scenarios. Putting oneself in their place, what should one do if faced with such a situation? This is the fourth point that "weighs the pros and cons" and necessitates blocking the breach.

3.  Methods for Blocking the Breach During the Period of Obstruction

If the breach is not blocked, the future disasters are too horrible to contemplate. If the breach is to be blocked, there are obstructing enemy troops. What plan should be adopted? When there is no other way, seek effective methods of adaptation. In my humble opinion, the central or local government should contact international charitable organizations for assistance, while various levels of government in our country assist with construction funds and other items. In the spring of 1932, the construction of the stone revetment and slope protection on the canal embankment at Gaoyou, the blockhouse at Loumiao Lane, and the Qigong Temple were all managed by the China International Famine Relief Commission, totaling more than 132,600 yuan in construction funds. Our country usually receives construction assistance from this organization. Moreover, now, in this time of turmoil, when 100,000 square miles are about to be submerged and millions of lives are about to perish, if our government requests and appeals to these charitable organizations, which have always embraced universal love and will not shirk their responsibility, how can they turn a deaf ear and not provide remedies? The China International Famine Relief Commission should be in charge of purchasing the materials for blocking the breach. The labor for blocking the breach should be carried out by relocating refugees from certain areas, using work as a form of relief. This matter concerns disaster relief and is being handled by international charitable organizations. It is expected that the enemy will not have any reason to obstruct it.

4.  A Plan for Struggling to Block the Breach

If blocking the existing breach is impossible, or within the range of our troops, measure the terrain within a distance of dozens of miles and build a new embankment elsewhere. Since the river is west of Mengjin, the mountains flank both banks, and it has never changed its course. East of Rongze and Guangwu Mountains, it is all plain, and the soil is loose and the land is wide, so the river course is complicated and frequently migrates. In the past, Mei Qizhao ordered officials to survey and map the river, stating that the width of the river varied, "The widest is said to be twenty or thirty li, or ten or twenty li, and the narrowest is said to be four or five li, or six or seven li, etc." Also, according to the豫乘識小錄, Jia Lu River flowed to Junyi during the Han Dynasty and divided, "One branch flowed south as the Sha River, and the other branch flowed east as the Bian River, but during the Yuan Dynasty, the Yellow River breached in the 27th year of Zhiyuan, and the eastward flowing branch was silted up." It also states, "When the Song Dynasty was in Bianjing, four canals were opened for water transport, called Bian River, Cai River, Wuzhang River, and Jinshui River. Because the Yellow River has shifted its course several times, they are all now submerged, and only the southeastern branch of the Bian River remains." Furthermore, according to the 光緒八年 李鶴年挑挖買河, from Li Mugang in Zhongmu to Xu Zhai in Xiangfu for more than thirty li, it was difficult to excavate the old river course, so a new river was dug along the old sand dunes at Wangtang, eight li west of Xu Zhai, which was even more beneficial.

### Finance: Tense Situation in Central Europe; Cash Gold Price Tried to Rise but Halted; Cash and Foreign Exchange Markets Closed for Holidays Starting Tomorrow

Yesterday, the unofficial market of cash gold futures trended weak again. It was reported that Italy was planning to occupy Albania, which caused sudden tensions in the international situation. Therefore, operators felt somewhat uneasy. Moreover, the potential for the Hong Kong dollar to weaken increased, and gold firms and money changers successively sold off. At the same time, a certain bank, acting on behalf of foreign merchants, cashed in on profits from long positions, which caused the market to turn weak. Initially, the situation was relatively stable due to absorption by cash gold firms and jewelry stores, but later, due to a lack of buyers, the price decreased, breaking through the 2,070 yuan level. As a result, it fell by four yuan, and trading was dull, less than 500 taels. Jewelry gold prices remained unchanged. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold, etc., all rose slightly. Starting tomorrow, for the Tomb Sweeping Festival (foreign 清明), all Chinese and foreign banks in this city, except for the Central Bank, will be closed for four days, including Sunday. The cash and foreign exchange markets will also be closed accordingly and will resume normal operations on the 11th (next Tuesday).

Unofficial Market of Gold Futures Falls by Four Yuan

The morning Mother bar (ten taels) had no open transactions at first. It was not until 9:45 that a certain cash gold firm, gold firm, and jewelry stores each entered 50 taels, with an opening price of 2,074.5 yuan, 1.5 yuan higher than the previous close. After opening, gold firms traded 50 taels with each other, at 75.5 yuan. Then, a certain jewelry store entered 50 taels from a money changer, at 75 yuan. Later, another jewelry store entered 100 taels from a certain bank, at 74.5 yuan. Before long, a certain jewelry store entered 50 taels from a gold firm, at 74 yuan. Soon, the same money changer also sold 50 taels to a jewelry store at the same price. After this, buyers stopped entering and waited to see. However, many parties were eager to sell due to fear in Europe. Although the price was shouted down to 70 yuan for sale, it was still difficult to find a counterparty. Therefore, the midday close was still 74 yuan. In the afternoon, money changers first traded 50 taels with each other, at 69 yuan. Later, money changers traded another 40 taels with each other, at the same price. After this, sellers still wanted to sell off, but there were even fewer entrants. Therefore, after 3:30, most members dispersed early due to a lack of supply and demand positions. The evening closing price was still 2,069 yuan, a decrease of four yuan compared to the previous close, with a difference of 6.5 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold firm's own brand of gold was 2,075 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,065 yuan. The current bid gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were no open transactions.

Jewelry Gold Prices Remain Unchanged

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael has not changed because the status of gold futures is still relatively stable. The 大同行 is still listed at 210 yuan, the 新同行 is at 208 yuan, and the purchase price is 202 yuan.

British Pound Weakens, Pure Gold Recovers

London, April 4th: Due to the resurgence of international tensions and widespread war rumors, and the weakening of the British pound, British pure gold regained its buying momentum, causing the price to rise by half a pence per ounce, reaching £7 8s 5.5d. The Central Bank of China's cash purchase price also rose to 1,211.9 yuan. The listed price of customs gold also rose by 0.2%, reaching 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 0.3 yuan, reaching 1,207.2 yuan.

### Hong Kong Dollar Falls Again

Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate fell by 0.1875. In this city's foreign exchange market, foreign firms needed to settle payments for silk and cotton, and the coal industry had substantial needs. Fortunately, foreign banks and telecommunications companies provided ample supply, stabilizing the market price. The U.S. dollar was slightly tight due to the weakening of the pound. The gold futures market opened firm, and gold firms and jewelry stores were actively absorbing. The market price hovered tightly. In the afternoon, money changers continued to sell off, but retail absorption was not smooth, forcing the market price down. As a result, it weakened slightly. Foreign currency, British gold pounds, were still actively being sold off. British and American gold notes were in high demand by foreign banks. Hong Kong notes were being heavily sold off by money changers, and the market price was weak. Public association transactions were still active. 承泰 sold and 同豐 bought U.S. gold notes for 500 yuan. 惠通 sold and 長泰 bought Hong Kong notes for 1,000 yuan. 承泰 sold and 長泰 bought U.S. gold notes for 100 yuan. 勤泰 sold and 同豐 bought Italian notes for 1,000. 惠通 sold and 同豐 bought Hong Kong notes for 1,000 yuan.

### Silver Forward Prices Slightly Weaker; Indian Silver Stable

London, April 4th: The silver market saw some short covering and Indian buying, and speculative selling, so the market was flat. After closing, the market was flat. Silver bar prices were unchanged for near-term delivery, and contracted by 0.0625 for forward delivery. New York silver: The spot price of U.S. silver remained fixed. Bombay silver: The Indian silver market was stable. The spot price and the April price both rose by one anna, but the May price remained unchanged.

### European Instability Causes Exchange Rate Decline; Tight US Dollar in Shanghai; Large Settlements for Imported Cotton and Coal, Renewed Selling Pressure on Hong Kong Dollar

Yesterday, due to tense relations between Italy and Albania, the British and American exchange rates suddenly weakened. Consequently, the market opened with a stable British dollar and a tight US dollar. However, heavy settlements for imported cotton and coal occurred midway through the day. Major foreign firms and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company made efforts to acquire British currency. However, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) and Mercantile Bank continued to supply currency as much as possible to maintain stability. Consequently, the situation remained largely unchanged. Although foreign firms also settled accounts in US dollars, supply from outside firms was ample, leading to a relatively stable situation. Ultimately, the US dollar was slightly tightened by the weakening exchange rate. Trading was quite brisk in the morning. The Hong Kong dollar experienced renewed selling pressure due to renewed fears about the European situation. Money changers and Chinese speculators tended to sell, causing the upward trend to reverse into a softer and more rigid state.

Early morning, the London cable showed little movement in near-term rates but a reduction of 0.0625 in forward rates. New York silver prices remained unchanged. London gold increased by half a pence. The exchange rate was slightly lower for British pounds against US dollars, unchanged against French francs and Shanghai currency. The US dollar fell by 0.1875 against the British pound, decreased by 0.0625 against the French franc, and increased by 0.03 against Shanghai currency. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The banks' opening selling prices in the morning were 8 pence 25 for the British pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar, which was unchanged for the British pound and tighter by 0.03125 for the US dollar compared to the closing prices of the previous evening. This was due to the pullback of 0.013 and 0.1875 in the British and American exchange rates, respectively. After opening, settlements for imported cotton and coal were frequent, but external firms such as HSBC continued to supply currency, so the situation remained stable. Foreign firms bought British currency at 8 pence 25 from HSBC and Mercantile Bank. The HSBC listed rates and the silver equalization tax rates were unchanged, remaining at a slight 4.50%. Later, major foreign firms also bought US dollars at 16.0625 yuan from banks such as Hua Yi and Hua Bi. The situation remained largely unchanged. As noon approached, foreign firms' settlements decreased, and the situation became more stable. However, Chinese merchants and money changers competed to sell Hong Kong dollars. As Chinese banks' absorption capacity was not strong, the underlying trend of the Hong Kong dollar was stiffening. Chinese merchants and money changers sold Hong Kong dollars to Chinese banks at 55.50 yuan, stiffening to 55.75 yuan. By the time of the noon closing, the banks' selling prices were 8 pence 25 for the British pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar, unchanged from the morning opening, resulting in a change of stable British pound and tighter by 0.03125 for the US dollar, and looser by 0.25 for the Hong Kong dollar compared to the previous closing. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Yesterday's discount rate for Shanghai's clearing house bills remained unchanged, consistently standing at the original price of 50 yuan per thousand. The usual additional or reduced fee of 0.25 yuan still applied, the same as the previous day.

### Securities: Bond Market Shaken Again; Public Utility Stocks Perform Best During Four-Day Spring Holiday Starting Today

The securities grey market yesterday experienced another setback after initial positive sentiment due to the blockade of Ningbo Port was dampened. The incessant turmoil in Europe caused wavering sentiment, creating conflicting sentiments among investors. Consequently, unstable stocks experienced unnecessary fluctuations. In addition, the market will be closed starting this afternoon for a four-day Spring Festival holiday, causing uncertainty among many investors and leading to increased selling pressure, resulting in a downward trend. It is unlikely there will be significant turbulence in the near future. Yesterday's activity: The market initially showed an upward trend due to buying by retail investors. Dafeng and Hongda firms were buying. However, the surge in selling by No. 52 caused Renchang, Songmao, Fengda, and Lianhe to sell, shifting the market sentiment to fatigue and reversing the upward trend to a decline. The high and low prices differed by nearly half a yuan in many cases. The afternoon saw even weaker sentiment and light trading. Renchang and No. 42 were selling, and many retail investors also exited. The only buyers were Dafeng and Zhenkang, resulting in an oversupply and continued stagnation of market prices. The market prices generally fell by 0.03 to 0.055 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately over 400,000 yuan. A brief summary table is provided below: Category, Highest, Lowest, Closing, Compared to Previous Day Unified A, 5785, 5730, 5730, Down 0.55 Unified B, 5200, 5140, 5140, Down 0.45 Unified C, 5160, 5100, 5110, Down 0.45 Unified D, 5050, 5005, 5005, Down 0.30 Unified E, 5070, 5005, 5010, Down 0.40 96, 6.60, 6.55, 6.60, Up 0.05.

London British Far East Companies Stock Market Prices on April 4th (Tuesday): There were continued fluctuations in HSBC and Kaiping shares. HSBC Bank shares increased by half a pound. Shares registered in London rose to 84.5 pounds, and shares registered in Hong Kong rose to 85.5 pounds. Kaiping Coal Mine bearer shares fell by 3 pence to 17 shillings and 6 pence. There were no other changes.

London Chinese Bonds Market Prices on April 4th (Tuesday): Prices were stable and unchanged. Today's supply of British bonds included British Boxer Indemnity Bonds worth 2,000 pounds, sold at 52 pounds and 5 shillings, 15 shillings above the market price. Additionally, there were Hukuang Railway Bonds German-issued marked bonds and German-issued marked drawn bonds, each worth 2,000 yuan or 100 pounds, totaling 5,000 pounds, all sold at 20.5 pounds, at market price.

Shanghai Public Concession Stock Market: The market was open for half a day, with public bus and tram shares in demand, while Jardine shares were slightly weaker. It is reported that although public bus and tram companies have not been able to extend their services throughout the Suzhou Creek area, the number of passengers is unprecedented in recent years, leading to buying interest in public bus shares at a recent high price of 25 yuan. Jardine shares were sold by many who profited, and new investors absorbed the supply, resulting in a stable closing price of 20.01 yuan for the buying price and 20.02 yuan for the selling price. Rubber shares continued to show sluggishness and stagnation.

### Yarn and Cloth: Blockade of Ningbo River Hinders the Surge in Cotton Yarn Prices – No Shortage of Bullish Sentiment in Daily Yarn

The yarn market continued to advance. Due to robust real demand, especially from the Chaoshan (Guangdong) and Hong Kong regions for 20-count Double Horse and Tiannu brands, sentiment was positive. The market felt slightly drained of available stock, leading to increasingly assertive intentions among traders, who were eager to secure inventory. Consequently, brokers were actively bidding in the market, creating a tight situation. According to some, certain individuals, seeing the improved environment, returned to buy up available quotas, purchasing several hundred bales, effectively depleting the general public's inventory. This further elevated market prices, with the peak price for 20-count Double Horse exceeding the 390-yuan mark, reaching 391 yuan. However, some bullish investors who had made significant profits, while acknowledging strong real demand in the south, felt that the price surge was too rapid and liquidated half of their holdings. In the afternoon opening, a sudden drop occurred. Market rumors claimed that there was a possibility of a self-imposed blockade of the Ningbo River in eastern Zhejiang, causing confusion and encouraging selling. The price of 20-count Double Horse quickly fell to 385 yuan.

Regarding the current yarn situation, the market opened cautiously in the morning with little movement. Market prices were also slow to emerge, increasing by 2.25 yuan, setting the price for 20-count Double Horse at 387.5 yuan. Shortly after, there was still demand from Hong Kong, instantly boosting sentiment and intensifying buying interest. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse reached 391 yuan. Before long, bullish investors began selling, immediately causing prices to retreat by one yuan, falling back within the 390-yuan range. The market then stabilized until closing. In the afternoon opening, market conditions changed abruptly. Rumors spread throughout the market, claiming that Ningbo River was being blockaded, and another rumor suggested that a certain factory was planning to sell 10-count Double Horse yarn. These two factors negatively impacted sentiment. Merchants rushed to sell their warehouse receipts, causing prices to decline steadily. It is estimated that a total of 2,142 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day. The market prices for 20-count Double Horse and Tiannu were similar to the previous day. Other brands experienced slightly uneven price fluctuations. Chongxin Factory offered 100 bales of 20-count Dafa at a price of 373 yuan. Today, 20 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 310 bales to Shantou, 790 bales to Tianjin, and 455 bales to Yantai. The purchase amounts by various groups are listed below: Tianjin: 60, Yunnan: 13, Traders: 1,250, Xiamen: 12, Shantou: 45, Hong Kong: 320, Sichuan: 35, Inland: 45. Total: 2,141

The daily yarn market remained consistently firm, mainly due to strong demand for Japanese cloth in the Yangtze River region recently. Some investors are leveraging this demand for bullish speculation, holding onto their positions. The current price for 20-count Shuiyue yarn is 350 yuan, and the current price for 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 344.5 yuan, with no significant changes compared to the previous day.

### Peng Kehai's Proposal Rejected by Congress; Complications Still Arise in American Cotton; Severe Shortage of Spot Foreign Cotton in Shanghai, Particularly Difficult to Export North China Cotton

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: New York cotton prices initially fell due to the unstable European situation and the sharp decline in securities prices, dragging down cotton prices. Overseas cotton merchants and domestic traders unanimously sold off, resulting in a severe drop of 12 to 13 points. Peng Kehai's proposal was rejected by Congress because it was deemed inconsistent with the Agricultural Adjustment Act to reduce cotton fields, and it was too late to reduce acreage since the fields had already been sown. Currently, Roosevelt's proposed export subsidies have not been completely abandoned and may still be discussed and implemented. There are still many complications with American cotton, making it easier for cotton prices to fall than rise. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 1.5 rupees. Egyptian cotton markets were closed. Exchange rates did not fluctuate significantly yesterday. Translated to legal tender, American cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 0.90 yuan per dan (unit), Indian cotton fell by 0.50 yuan, and Egyptian cotton fell by 0.30 yuan.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Trading in Shanghai has been particularly quiet this week. Factories are only engaging in sporadic transactions. Most of the previously ordered Indian cotton is awaiting shipment in India and has not been shipped on schedule, so factories are actively searching for spot goods in the market. However, spot goods are severely scarce in the market, leading to exceptionally high prices. Based on the current shipping situation, there is no expectation for Indian cotton to arrive in large quantities even by the beginning of May. Therefore, factories are closely monitoring the American market, hoping for the early release of loan cotton. The futures prices for foreign cotton and the combined delivery prices to factories for yesterday are as follows: Raw Material, Category, Brush plus tax: 60-count Egyptian Cotton, Superior Grade: 105.05, Medium Grade: 102.15, 80-count: Superior Grade: 39.70, Medium Grade: 29.50, 20-count American Middling: 82.90, 69.75, 32-count: Inferior Grade: 91.60, 80.70, 42-count: Inferior Grade: 93.40, 81.65, South American Brazilian Cotton: Superior Grade: 87.20, Medium Grade: 83.90, Inferior Grade: 74.75, 50-count Indian Pingguoer: 61.75, 16-count Indian Aomula: 64.35, 20-count Indian Bailuoqu: 72.10, 24-count Indian Pengjiapu: 79.55, 32-count American Xint: 84.75, 31/41-count American Pengjiapu: 89.20.

The local cotton business is becoming increasingly quiet. Both Chinese and foreign factories have no intention of taking action, but even those who want to buy have no goods available for smooth trading. This is due to the closure of various supply sources. As for cotton from the North China production area, there is still 30-40% available, but the "Japanese puppet" regime only allows these cotton transactions to occur locally and does not permit exports. Therefore, the only source of supply is through northern Jiangsu Province. Under these circumstances, the cotton market is in a state of neither death nor life. The price of local cotton is similar to the previous day, but Tongzhou cotton has increased by 0.20 to 0.40 yuan. The current local cotton situation is recorded below: Local 70.30, Traders bought 130 bales, cash price, Tongzhou 77.20, Bought 100 bales, transfer payment, 77.40, Bought 110 bales, transfer payment.

### Piece Goods: The Price of Cloth Continues to Rise; Large Stockpiles of Autumn Goods in this Street; Real Sales of Eastern Piece Goods See Major Expansion

The price of domestic cloth continues to rise sharply for Eastern piece goods. Chinese factories are uniformly raising prices, causing excited sentiment. The price of bleached and dyed cloth is also increasing. The Lunchang Factory has increased the price of New American Yuan silk by 0.30 yuan per bolt, and the price of Qiankun printed bleached cloth has increased by 0.25 yuan per bolt. The price of colored cloth and colored twill has also increased by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan per bolt. Wholesale shops on this street are widely searching for goods at favorable prices, and large quantities of autumn and winter goods such as flannel, broadcloth, and velvet are being stocked and transferred to warehouses. Sales are brisk. Dye factories on White Cloth Street are heavily absorbing fine twill, with over 300 pieces sold at a price increase of 0.10 to 0.15 yuan per bolt. The Guangdong group has purchased nearly 50 pieces of fine cloth. Traders have absorbed a considerable amount of low-priced goods, causing the market to rebound. Dapeng has increased by 0.15 yuan per bolt, and other goods have increased by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan. The price of coarse cloth has also stabilized. This street purchased over 100 bales of Jardine cloth, and the Wenzhou group purchased 30 to 40 bales. Groups from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong have purchased the most colored cloth and colored twill, with over 10,000 bolts sold yesterday. The Fujian group purchased over 2,000 bolts of bleached cloth, striped clean cloth, poplin, and colored cloth, all packed for mailing. The buying from Gan Guangfeng, Hengfeng, and other places has increased again, purchasing over 1,000 bolts of various mixed goods.

Due to the expansion of real sales, Eastern piece goods are continuously rising in price without end. Yesterday, the selling price of fine cloth and fine twill increased again by about 0.10 yuan per bolt. Throughout the day, traders continued to transact approximately 2,000 pieces. Jiang merchants and foreign firms purchased over 200 bales of Longtou fine cloth at a peak price of 12.70 yuan. The demand for Four Gentlemen broadcloth has been strong, with over 1,000 boxes already ordered, but the supply still cannot meet the demand, so the market price has increased by another point. Yesterday, it was sold at 0.425 yuan per yard.

Regarding export piece goods, 180 pieces were shipped to Yantai today, 210 pieces to Tianjin, 180 pieces to Shantou, and 10 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Grains: Scattered Sales of Local Flour Still Active; Reduced Interest from Northern Traders

Factory Flour: Yesterday, the market conditions for existing flour from factories continued to be firm. Since the factories uniformly set prices, scattered retail sales have been very active. This is because the market price of foreign flour has been firm and high in recent days, exceeding that of factory flour. Traders in this street are also willing to buy due to the need for regular sales in their usual channels. However, the interest of northern traders has gradually declined. It is reported that Tianjin is being flooded with foreign flour, causing the market to decline. Therefore, there are fewer new transactions. The demand for lower-grade flour is still good, but the factories have limited inventory and production capacity, making it difficult to achieve brisk sales. Consequently, traders in this street, inland, and the Yangtze River region have purchased a total of over 20,000 bags of various brands of flour in small quantities. The northern and southern traders have jointly purchased over 20,000 bags. The northern traders have also purchased several thousand bags each of No. 3 and No. 4 flour. The price of No. 2 flour remains at the original price of 4.40 yuan, and the prices of No. 3 and No. 4 flour have also stabilized. Regarding flour exports, 15,000 bags were shipped to Tianjin today, 7,000 bags to Shantou, and 1,000 bags of bran were also shipped to Shantou.

Foreign Flour: The market conditions for foreign flour are also firm. According to investigations, the 200,000 bags newly arrived at Shunquanlong Foreign Firm have not yet been offered to the market. This is because large customers are planning to hold firm on their orders, so the arrival of the goods has no significant impact. Yesterday, northern traders sold only 2,000 to 3,000 bags at a price of 4.10 to 4.15 yuan for cash. The asking prices for retail sales of brands like Bat Brand in this street are 4.50 yuan for transfer payment and 4.30 yuan for cash, including fees. Even so, only a few thousand bags have been sold. Currently, the market is still consolidating. However, with the arrival of large quantities of existing goods, the market supply will increase, which will inevitably affect sentiment.

It has been verified that 250 bags of beans were transported to Xiaozhou, and another 500 bags were transported to Hong Kong.

### Australian Wheat Arrives in Shanghai; Wheat Intended for Ningbo Temporarily Unloaded

Foreign wheat continues to arrive. It has been learned that the Riley, managed by Jardine Matheson, is carrying approximately 8,000 tons of wheat from Australia and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 8th. It is scheduled to dock at floating pontoon No. 11.11 for unloading. As for the Endeavor of the Chinese-Italian Company, which had loaded 16,800 bags of wheat in Shanghai for transportation to Ningbo, it suddenly received a telegram from Ningbo yesterday morning, notifying that the local defense commander had prohibited ships from entering or leaving the port starting this afternoon (yesterday afternoon). As a result, the Endeavor cancelled its trip to Ningbo and unloaded the wheat it had loaded.

### Glutinous Rice Fluctuates then Stabilizes; Rice Shops Close for Two Days

Yesterday, sources from various groups, including the river downstream area, arrived in over ten batches. The car wheel, bun, Suzhou-Tong Group and Kunshan Group arrived in over one thousand bags. The market was still lively at the opening, and sellers were calling out high prices. However, the market saw a public announcement late in the evening that rice shops would be closed for two days on the 8th and 9th for the Qingming Festival. As a result, traders became less interested. Although speculators were active, they all chose mid-range low-priced goods. Therefore, the market can be described as tight at first and then stable. High-quality glutinous rice still commanded high prices, and only mid-range downstream river goods performed slightly better, increasing by a few points to a few corners. Du Yang, Jianbu, and Yinbianyuan rice remained unchanged. Today, 4,900 bags of rice arrived from Hong Kong and were transferred to Tianjin.

### Customer Xian Rice Sales Slightly Increase

The arrival of customer xian rice was not significant yesterday, but sales were active due to the upcoming holiday, and total market transactions increased to over 3,000 bags. Moreover, Shanghai's glutinous rice and japonica rice both reported price increases. Sellers had upward intentions and uniformly called out higher prices. However, speculative investors and customer groups had limited dealings, and a small number of floating traders also planned to sell later in the market, so the market price could not be fully raised, only slightly better than the opening selling price of the previous day by 4-5 points.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Reverses from Decline to Increase; Continuous Arrival of Raw Oil Leads to Decline

Yesterday, the soybean oil market did not experience significant fluctuations. A large-scale continuous decline has been reported, and government control is still under discussion, so the future is still expected to rise. Yesterday morning, even though the continuous oil market fell by 0.60 yuan (to 35.40 yuan) upon opening due to excessive selling pressure (previous day's closing price was 36.00 yuan), domestic sales activity increased later on, and other Qishuyan soybean oils were uniformly offered at the original price, causing the market to reverse from decline to increase. In the afternoon, the price jumped above the 36 yuan mark, and because the market will be closed for two days starting today (the 6th and 7th), investor sentiment had this effect. By closing, the price was 36.75 yuan, an increase of 0.75 yuan compared to the previous day. An estimated 300 barrels of Dalian oil, 300 pieces of large and small baskets of Lianqi oil, 300 pieces of Yanqi oil, and 300 dan of factory soybean oil were transacted. Peanut oil, due to flat sales and continuous supply, saw dissipating market conditions, leading to a continued decline in prices. Only 100 cans of Tsingtao canned oil were transacted at a price of 40.05 yuan, and 20 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were transacted at a price of 42.50 yuan.

A total of 2,900 pieces of raw oil were imported yesterday, coming from Tsingtao. Additionally, 1,945 pieces of asphalt oil arrived from Wenzhou.

### Sugar Market: Opening Price for Sliced Green Sugar Drops by 0.20-0.30 Yuan; Foreign Sugar Continues to Rise; Significant Amounts of Sugar Arrive from Shantou and Hong Kong

Yesterday, the trend for foreign sugar was positive, continuing to rise. The association's price setting rose again by 0.10 to 0.05 yuan. The price for 24 Dutch coarse white outside warehouse goods was 25.20 yuan, inside warehouse goods was 25.35 yuan, Great Golden Coin brand was 25.65 yuan, Taikoo XA brand was 25.10 yuan, and transit goods was 17.10 yuan. The price for Taikoo Sugar B brand, Western goods was 25.30 yuan, CW brand was 25.20 yuan, CX brand was 25.00 yuan, DY brand was 24.80 yuan, and HX brand was 24.70 yuan. The price for Dutch red inside warehouse goods was 16.75 yuan. The price for Zhenji No. 2 inside refined white was 25.10 yuan, No. 2 was 24.80 yuan, No. 3 was 24.50 yuan, and No. 4 was 24.20 yuan. Over 300 bags of sliced green stone gate were offered at a price of 11.00 yuan to 10.80 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.30 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading of other Chaozhou sugar was sporadic, with no price changes. Arrivals included 600 bags of Xiamen military white, 305 cases of boxed sugar, 1,432 bags of Diao Qing, and 250 bags transferred from Yantai, 500 bags of Hong Kong car white, 279 bags of red sand, and 144 bags from Guangzhou Bay, and 2,460 bags from Youtou.

### Dried and Fresh Goods: Lake Lotus Seeds Open at 42 Yuan

Since the beginning of spring, few lake lotus seeds have arrived. It has been found that 19 pieces arrived a few days ago, which was likely raised by a certain firm to do business, opening at 42 yuan. The previous increase has reached more than 10 yuan. It is said that the Shantou group has considerable sales and should be wary of further tightening in the later market.

### Silk and Tea: Market Conditions Return to Normal; White Filature Silk Transactions are Very Brisk

Recently, domestic and international silk markets have become increasingly stable. The sales of silk by foreign firms in Shanghai have also recovered. Yesterday, New York spot silk prices increased by 0.03 yuan, and Shanghai silk prices increased by 0.02 yuan. The exchange's spot and forward prices were slightly sluggish. For example, Yokohama standard goods increased by 5 yuan, and the forward opening price remained unchanged, which did not affect market sentiment and further proved the normality of market expansion and contraction. Therefore, the silk trading of foreign firms in Shanghai was very brisk yesterday. Firms such as Jiahe, Dachang, Lianna, and Renchang all had transactions of over 50 bales. Observing the market conditions, the demand from foreign markets is uniformly for Grade 7/8 silk from white filatures, and the transactions are all for April forward or spot goods, showing that the American market's demand for Grade 7/8 spot silk is very urgent. However, since foreign sales have been sluggish for as long as two months, the recovery of silk sales, with silk prices now stable after the price decline, further highlights the impact of speculative enthusiasm and the inseparability of real sales and silk prices. Yesterday, the city's total turnover was 280 dan, with an opening price of 1,700 yuan. Market sentiment is normal, and investor sentiment is gradually improving. It is expected that sales of Qili spun silk can also be developed accordingly, and silk prices are expected to rise.

### Metals: Replacements for Company Iron Flood the Market; Price Reductions for 200-Pound Standard Iron

200-pound standard company iron, due to previous shortages, standard prices once reached as high as 55-56 yuan. However, ultimately it was difficult to sell due to the high prices, so there were few actual transactions in the market, except for more inquiries. Recently, replacement company iron in bundles has flooded in, and narrow tinplate has also been shipped frequently, causing the market to be flooded with goods. Moreover, buyers all prefer inexpensive goods, so they have switched to buying replacement company iron and narrow goods, making it even more difficult to sell standard company iron. In order to make sales, traders have been cutting prices, so market opening prices have fallen by several yuan. For example, old steel factory goods sell for 54.50 yuan per box, and new steel factory goods sell for 53.75 yuan. However, there were still not many transactions in the market yesterday, with only 200-300 boxes offered for sale. Factory families made nothing from sales to other groups.

### Coal: Surplus of Wenzhou Coal; Traders Set Minimum Prices; American Coal Also Arrives in Shanghai

Since Wenzhou coal was allowed to be exported, large quantities have been arriving repeatedly, reaching 50,000 to 60,000 dan, causing various industries to be fully stocked, leading to a sharp decrease in imports, and even selling off with commissions. Seeing this situation, the Wooden Charcoal Company, considering that it was not a long-term solution, gathered traders in the city and established a "Marketing Office" to set limit prices in order to avoid losses. The opening price for Grade A bamboo charcoal is 3 yuan per dan, and the price for green charcoal is 4 yuan. Traders uniformly charge each other, and customers add their commission.

American coal has also arrived in Shanghai. The Rabycastle, managed by Jardine Matheson, is carrying a total of 7,500 tons from New York and is scheduled to enter the port this afternoon and dock at Yangshupu floating pontoon Nos. 31 and 32 for transfer.

### Chiang Kai-shek's Order to Block Zhenhai Port: Foreign Ships Remaining in Ningbo All Sailed to Shanghai Yesterday; Lao Taiping is Not Yet Sunk; Traffic Completely Severed; Ningbo and Wenzhou Areas Peaceful, Public Morale Extremely Calm

Following the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang, the coastal and river garrisons are on standby, ready for action. The authorities, acting on Chiang Kai-shek's telegraphic order, began complete blockade of Ningbo's Zhenhai Port last night. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has promulgated measures for evacuating the population from various cities and towns, and foreign ships remaining in Ningbo have left for Shanghai. Details are as follows:

Measures for Evacuating the Population from Cities and Towns

The evacuation measures for cities and towns in Zhejiang Province are as follows: (1) Cities and towns where military situation forecasts indicate a risk of Japanese air raids should evacuate their populations according to these measures. (2) The following categories of people in cities and towns should be evacuated: 1. All organs and groups stationed in the city or town that are not essential for administrative or military purposes; 2. Refugee shelters; 3. Elderly, weak, women, children, and unemployed residents without property; 4. Factories employing a large number of workers. (3) All organs and groups stationed in cities and towns that are not specifically related to administrative or military affairs should be ordered by the county government to relocate to rural areas. (4) External refugees in cities and towns should be relocated to the suburbs or rural areas by the county government in conjunction with the refugee support association in the city, or by the district office or police in conjunction with local legal entities in the town. (5) For elderly, weak, women, and children residents in cities and towns, the county police, anti-Japanese self-defense corps, and protective corps should conduct a house-by-house investigation in the city, and the district office or police station, town office, and self-defense forces should do the same in the town, persuading all unemployed and propertyless individuals to relocate. (6) Residents of cities and towns who deliberately violate evacuation warnings may be forcibly evacuated by the responsible police agency, depending on the circumstances. (7) After evacuating the population, the responsible police agency in each city or town should conduct a thorough census of the remaining population. Subsequently, any newly arriving people should be limited to relocating to rural areas within the shortest possible time, except for the following reasons for residency: 1. Those who have come to the city or town to take up employment and have proof; 2. Those who are engaged in industry or commerce in the city or town and are returning after being away for business; 3. Those who have come to the city or town for medical treatment for a serious illness; 4. Those who have come to the city or town for a long-term stay for business and have proof; 5. Those who have relatives in the city or town who are employed and have come to visit. (8) The county police, self-defense forces, and protective corps are responsible for handling the evacuation of residents in the city, and the district office, police station, town office, and self-defense forces are responsible for handling it in the town. (9) The areas and times for the implementation of these measures will be determined by the provincial government in a separate order.

Evacuation of Goods from Wenzhou and Ningbo

After receiving orders to devise methods to evacuate accumulated goods from the Ningbo and Wenzhou ports in eastern Zhejiang, the chambers of commerce of both ports immediately convened meetings of various industries and decided on two measures: to find ways to load and transport domestic goods blocked in both places to ports in Shanghai, and to find ways to transport imported goods to the rear. It has been verified that the Zhenhai Port of Ningbo and the Ou River Estuary of Wenzhou have long been subject to blockade, but previously a gap was left in the blockade line to maintain navigation. The Zhenhai blockade line of the Yong River is fully prepared for complete blockade, and the Lao Taiping ship has been docked at the Zhenhai wharf in advance, to be used as a plug for the blockade gap when necessary. Water mines and other dangerous materials have been placed inside the Ou River in Wenzhou for defense.

Ordered to Announce the Blockade of the Yong River

At around 10:00 AM yesterday, the shipping industry in this city suddenly received a telegram from Ningbo stating, "The defense command has received an order from the Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] that the Yong River will be blockaded with immediate effect. The defense department has ordered all ships remaining in Ningbo to leave Ningbo by 3:00 PM on the 5th." After the telegram arrived in Shanghai, the shipping departments of German merchant Reith & Co., Italian merchant Sino-Italian Shipping Company, American merchant China-America Navigation Company, and Portuguese merchant Chengte Company all telegraphed to inquire about the truth. According to subsequent telegrams, the Yong River is now ordered to be blockaded because the evacuation of cargo has been completed. The German ship Hana, the Portuguese ship Sante, and the Italian ship Deping, all remaining in Ningbo, telegraphed that they had left Ningbo for Shanghai yesterday afternoon, one after another between 1:00 and 2:00 PM. It is reported that the ships were extremely crowded with passengers and cargo and that they will all arrive in port this morning.

Seeking Fortune, the Folded-Back Shanghai Ship Stops Sailing

The German merchant Reith & Co.'s Moufu ship, after announcing its return to service upon completion of its annual repairs, had sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo once on the 31st of last month. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, it sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo for the second time, arriving at Zhenhai Port at 8:00 AM yesterday. At that time, it was notified by the maritime inspection team that the Yong River had been declared to be blockaded at 3:00 PM that afternoon, and the ship was instructed not to enter the port. The ship then anchored outside the port, but the company argued that the ship was carrying a large amount of Shanghai cargo and requested that the command allow it to enter the port to unload the cargo and then sail out. After approval by the command, it entered the port at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. However, because the deadline of 3:00 PM had arrived, it did not have time to unload the cargo and sailed back to Shanghai on the same ship at around 2:00 PM. Most of the passengers on board also returned to Shanghai on the same ship. As for the American merchant Tangsai ship and the Portuguese merchant Meida ship, which were originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo one after the other yesterday and today, they have now stopped sailing due to the blockade of Zhenhai.

Taiping Not Sunk, Traffic Completely Severed

After the outbreak of war, the Yong River was blocked at Zhenhai Port with several Xinjiangtian ships and small barge boats to strengthen defenses. Plum blossom piles were also driven into the riverbed, leaving only a gap for navigating ships to enter and exit. Last year, to further strengthen the blockade, the Lao Taiping ship was sailed to the blockade gap and prepared to be scuttled if deemed necessary, completely blocking the gap. Yesterday, after the news of the blockade of the river reached Shanghai, there was general concern that the Lao Taiping ship would be scuttled. After the shipping companies telegraphed to inquire, they were informed that ships were only being prohibited from entering and exiting, and there was no mention of scuttling the Taiping ship. Therefore, it seems to be the same situation as the blockade last year. As of 7:00 PM yesterday, there was no news of the sinking of the Taiping ship. Traffic on the Shanghai-Ningbo line was completely severed from 3:00 PM yesterday.

Ou River Not Blockaded, Shipping Still Open

After the Yong River was announced to be blockaded yesterday, the shipping industry was quite concerned about whether the Ou River in Wenzhou would also be blockaded. The Portuguese merchant Meili Company in this city telegraphed to inquire, but there was no news of preparations for a blockade. Other shipping companies also did not receive any telegrams related to the blockade of the Ou River. The Italian merchant Shili ship and the American merchant Tangqiao ship both sailed to Wenzhou as usual at 4:00 PM yesterday. The German merchant Feikang ship, the Portuguese merchant Meifa ship, and the German merchant Haifu ship are scheduled to sail to Wenzhou today and tomorrow. However, according to general observations, if the situation becomes tense, the Ou River may be blockaded at any time, as the military authorities of Zhejiang Province have already taken preparations at that port.

Ningbo and Wenzhou Peaceful, Public Morale Calm

According to inquiries by the Modern News Agency reporter, after the announcement of the blockade of Zhenhai Port in Ningbo, the business situation was slightly tense, because the interruption of traffic and the lack of commodity sources caused prices to rise significantly, but the authorities are trying to curb this trend. The local order is absolutely peaceful, and the general public morale is also extremely calm, without any panic. Wenzhou is also as peaceful as ever, and all businesses are operating as usual.

### Mr. Fessenden Reelected as Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council; Decision Made by the Chinese, British, and American Board of Directors; Annual Meeting of Western Ratepayers Scheduled

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession held its final meeting of this year in the council chamber of the bureau at 4:00 PM yesterday. All directors attended and discussed several routine cases before adjourning. The list of directors for the next term has already been submitted, so there is no need for voting during the election. After discussion among the Chinese, British, and American board of directors, it was considered that in this extraordinary period, handling all military conflicts is not something that inexperienced people can do. Therefore, it was decided to ask Mr. Fessenden to continue to serve as chairman and shoulder the difficult task. Mr. Fessenden has made outstanding achievements in the past year, mediating between various parties, and is widely supported by the Chinese and foreign people in the concession, all of whom express their sympathy. The annual meeting of Western ratepayers for 1939 has also been scheduled for the 18th and 19th of this month at the Da Guang Ming Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road.

### British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, Arrives in Shanghai; Said to Have No Political Significance or Unofficial Meetings with the Japanese Side; Staying in Shanghai for About a Week, Return Date Not Yet Determined

British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, arrived in Shanghai on the Canadian Empress ship yesterday at 12:30 PM, accompanied by his wife, taking advantage of his vacation. The ship docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Various parties in Europe and Japan have paid close attention to Mr. Craigie's trip. However, Mr. Craigie himself said that his visit was purely for vacation. The details are as follows:

Arrival Situation

When the ship arrived, those who went to welcome him included senior officials from the British Embassy in China and the British Consul-General in Shanghai, Philip. After disembarking, Mr. Craigie and his wife took an embassy car to the British Embassy in China on the Bund for a short rest, and then went to Ambassador Coeur's residence on Dunxin Road.

Nature of Vacation

According to Mr. Craigie's conversation with visitors yesterday, his visit was purely for rest and had no political significance. He will be staying in Shanghai for about a week. During his stay, he may have some contact with Japanese officials in Shanghai, but he can say that even if there are such meetings, their nature will not be diplomatic contacts, that is, they will all be unofficial. The nature of Mr. Craigie's visit, as reported by Tokyo and other parties, has been noted with significant records. According to the attendants accompanying Mr. Craigie to China, the ambassador's visit has no political nature and is purely for vacation.

General Observation

According to the observation of people with status and access to information, all parties in the world concerned about the Far East issue have paid close attention to Mr. Craigie's visit to China. All parties believe that Mr. Craigie's visit has political significance. Therefore, it is speculated that his meeting with Ambassador Coeur will have an important relationship with Britain's future policy towards the Far East. It is also noteworthy that Mr. Craigie will meet with ambassadors from other countries to China during his stay in Shanghai.

Mr. Craigie's Reputation

Mr. Craigie was appointed as the ambassador to Japan after the completion of the London Naval Treaty. He is very knowledgeable about naval affairs and has a high reputation in the country. After serving as the ambassador to Japan, he has made efforts to mediate various issues between Britain and Japan, and most of them have yielded results. The British government relies on him very much. However, Japanese newspapers in Shanghai believe that Mr. Craigie's meeting with Ambassador Coeur will affect British-Japanese diplomacy. For example, the Shanghai Daily News said that this meeting will definitely lead to changes in Britain's attitude towards Japan.

Coeur's Travel Schedule

According to another source, after detailed discussions with Sir Robert Craigie in the coming days, British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr is scheduled to go to Chongqing on the 12th to visit the Chinese government authorities. The duration of Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's stay in Chongqing has not yet been heard, but it is known that he will return to Shanghai after completing his official duties in Chongqing.

### Japanese Monopoly of the Pig Industry; Strong Collection of Heavy Taxes; Pigs Shipped to Shanghai by Moller Yesterday Refuse to Pay Taxes and Refuse to Pick Up Goods

After Japanese merchants attempted to monopolize the pig industry, the Japanese merchant Da Lu Wuchan Company's Chiyomaru ship forcibly loaded fresh pigs from Xingang to Shanghai. Because of the extra charge of two yuan per pig, all pig merchants unanimously opposed it, resulting in the inability to pick up the goods. It is learned that Watanabe Kichizo, the person in charge of the Da Lu Company, agreed to reduce it to one yuan per pig. Under the forced environment, the pig merchants reluctantly accepted it yesterday. Starting yesterday, pig merchants have sent vehicles to Hongkou to pick up and unload the pigs. Due to the excessive time the pigs spent on the ship, more than 300 pigs died or were injured. The pig merchants are now preparing to file a claim for compensation with the Jiangbei unloading company. Unexpectedly, one wave has just subsided, and another wave has risen. Yesterday, more than 2,000 fresh pigs loaded on the British merchant Taikoo Company's Huangpu ship and the Laixiang Yanghang's Christien Moller ship also had to pay an additional two yuan per pig in cargo tax to the Da Lu Company. It is heard that the pig merchants are now firmly opposed and refuse to pick up the goods. It is not yet known how this dispute will be resolved.

### Outgoing Postal Workers Departed Yesterday; Four Japanese Postal Workers are in Training

The Shanghai Postal Administration recently hired four Japanese postal workers who are currently undergoing training in Shanghai. After the training is completed, they will be assigned to serve in post offices in various occupied areas. As for the 65 Chinese postal clerks who were transferred to Xiang, Qian, and Gui, except for three who had already departed last month via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the remaining 63 took a ship to Shantou yesterday, transferring to Qujiang to report to the post offices in their respective transferred locations.

### Negotiations on Opening the Yangtze River; British and American Attitudes are Firm; If the Japanese Side Firmly Refuses to Open, the Navies of Both Countries will Take Appropriate Action

Regarding the issue of opening the Yangtze River, the British and American military authorities in Shanghai recently resumed negotiations with the Japanese side. The commanders of the British and American naval fleets in Shanghai had each sent a strong note to the Japanese side in advance. If the Japanese side firmly refuses to open the Yangtze River, the British and American naval fleets will take the most appropriate measures to promote its automatic realization and will lead the merchant ships of their respective countries to resume sailing without hindering the actions of the Japanese army. However, the Japanese side still refused to accept the notes from the British and American military authorities. Therefore, although the negotiations have restarted, there has been no progress to date. There are many hidden reefs, and it is not easy to break through this difficult situation for a while.

### Finance and Economics Ministries Discussed the Issue of Exchange Recovery; The Pseudo Regime's Attempt to Take Over Has Not Been Abandoned; The Attitudes of Each Exchange are Firm and They Will Not Cooperate

Regarding the issue of the resumption of trading in the Shanghai exchanges, after each exchange followed the orders of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, they conducted separate studies. They all believed that the methods set by the two ministries had many obstacles with the reality of the Shanghai market. Even if they resumed, not only would there be no guarantee of the future of their business, but they would also invite certain parties to take advantage of the opportunity, which would affect the country's finances. Therefore, after several discussions, they specially signed various opinions and jointly submitted them to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. A telegram has been received in response, stating that the joint methods submitted by each exchange are quite appropriate. The two ministries are currently discussing the matter together, and the exchanges are asked to wait quietly for approval. According to inquiries by the Modern News Agency reporter from relevant parties yesterday, the "Reformed Government" has not abandoned its attempt to take over the exchanges and is still in progress. However, the attitudes of each exchange are firm and they will not be tempted. They will wait quietly for the central government to handle the matter properly.

### Dr. Green's Efforts in Relief Work; Will Make a Thousand-Mile Trek by Car; Came to Shanghai in a Hurry to Get Medicines and Left

The Mainland News reported that Dr. Green of Xiangya Hospital in Changsha hurriedly returned to Shanghai yesterday morning (the 4th) at 10:00 AM to obtain some supplies to make a thousand-mile circuit by car through three provinces and urgently notified various relief agencies that an estimated twenty tons of medical supplies are currently safe. Less than seven hours later, Green took a ship back to Ningbo. According to the reporter's visit to Green during his short stay in Shanghai, his "Modern Medical Motorcade," in addition to two truckloads of medicines, had all arrived in Jinhua, the seat of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The last batch of medicines was blocked from transport due to the rapid rise of the river water, but it is expected that the river water will recede when he returns. Green originally planned to take a train from Jinhua to Changsha, but this route was cut off due to the fall of Nanchang. Therefore, Green had to take his truck around the south of the railway, estimating that the rugged road would reach about a thousand miles. A month ago, the team only had two trucks, one owned by the Red Cross and the other transported by Green when he left Shanghai on March 19. Green also said that the military authorities of Zhejiang Province have allowed the supply of trucks to transport medicines to the border of Jiangxi Province and are trying to arrange for the Jiangxi provincial authorities to transport the gasoline needed to transport the medicines across Jiangxi Province. It is scheduled to depart on Friday. All other members of Green's party have arrived in Changsha, as they took the last train departing from Jinhua. Now only a hundred miles of the railway are open. Accompanying Green are the Reverend Talbot of the American Church in Changsha, two doctors who volunteered to go, one American and one German Jewish refugee, as well as a pastor, a nun, and several Chinese nurses. The motorcade has a new American truck, which contains 525 boxes of medical equipment and medicines, donated by the American Red Cross, the China Medical Association, and the Lord Mayor of London's Fund. On March 19, they left Shanghai for , and then the medicines were transported by boat to Huangchang (translated chapter), thirty miles away. After arriving at that place, they had to be transported to Jinhua by truck. Because there were only two trucks, they had to be transported in rotation. When only two truckloads of medicines were left, the river water suddenly rose overnight, making it impossible to pass. Knowing that the river water would not recede for at least three days, Green took the Tang Qiaosi ship to hurriedly arrive here yesterday morning to get supplies needed for the truck and to have a last-minute consultation with the relief agencies that helped him.

### Anti-British Parade to Be Held in Hankou

The Shanghai Times reported that reliable news was received in Shanghai yesterday (the 4th) that an anti-British parade will be held in Hankou on April 15, which is Saturday. Yesterday afternoon, when the Japanese side entertained reporters, a reporter asked the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy whether Japanese officials would participate in the parade. The spokesman replied that he had not received such news at all. According to a report from Nanjing, 52 anti-British associations have been formally established in the Japanese-occupied area, and the number of people participating in the anti-British association in Nanjing has reached 150,000. Female members have now begun to boycott British goods. The Anti-British Association of Nanjing also issued a declaration, denouncing Britain for invading China and hindering the "construction work of China." It is heard that the construction work of the Anti-British Association is to instill anti-British education in children.

### Sichuan to Establish a Large Sugar Factory; Capital Tentatively Set at Three Million

The Chinese government is currently planning to establish a large-scale sugar factory in Sichuan. The location is currently being selected, with a capital of three million yuan. Two million yuan will be allocated by the Bank of China, and the remaining one million yuan will be borne equally by the Sichuan Provincial Government and local sugar merchants. This new sugar factory will be established soon.

### Rumor that the Japanese Side Sent Amano as a Special Envoy to China

The Mainland News reported that according to the Tokyo Daily News, Amano, the former spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Tokyo, a person well-known to foreigners in Tokyo, Shanghai, and Geneva, may replace Tani Masazane, who was recalled to China last fall, as a special Japanese envoy to China to adjust the relationship between Japan and third countries regarding the liquidation of the China Incident. Amano is currently the ambassador to Switzerland. The newspaper also said that Amano's appointment to this position is almost certain.

### Japanese Army on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Retreats East of Qingyigang; Fierce Battle for a Day and Night, the Japanese Army Collapses Miserably; Guerrillas Prepare to Cross the Port and Attack

The Japanese army at Qingyigang on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway was suddenly attacked by guerrillas the night before last (the 3rd). After a fierce battle for a day and night, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and collapsed, retreating to the east of the river, unable to fight back. Now the guerrillas have joined forces with nearby friendly forces to prepare to cross the port and attack the remaining enemies.

### Ministry of Finance Stipulates Measures for the Disposal of Captured Salt; All Should Be Handed Over to the Salt Affairs Authority for Disposal; The Net Proceeds from the Sale to Merchants Should Be Used as a Bonus

In order to dispose of the salt captured by the troops, the Ministry of Finance has specially stipulated measures for the disposal of captured salt, which have been submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for approval and implementation. The measures are as follows: Article 1. All salt owned by the enemy's army and organs that is directly captured and becomes the property of our side is called captured salt. Those originally owned by the salt households or field merchants in the salt field, or originally owned by our salt affairs authority or salt merchants in the sales area, are not included. All salt captured from the enemy should be handed over in full to the local or nearby salt affairs authority (or the authority that also handles salt affairs, such as the finance bureaus in Shandong and Hebei provinces) for disposal. Article 2. After receiving the captured salt, the salt affairs authority should immediately verify the net weight and issue a receipt, which should be handed over to the troops or people who originally captured the salt. Article 3. If all or part of the salt captured by the troops needs to be used for military purposes, the troops that originally captured the salt may issue a receipt with the quantity noted and obtain it from the salt affairs authority that received the salt. In addition to the salt itself, which does not need to be calculated, the salt affairs authority should calculate the tax payable according to the local current tax rate for the salt allocated for military use, and submit it to the Salt Affairs Administration together with the troops' salt receipt. The Salt Affairs Administration will then submit it to the Ministry of Finance, which will be reconciled with the Ministry of Military Administration. Article 4. If the salt is not allocated for military use, the salt affairs authority should issue it to merchants for sale after receiving it. The net proceeds from the sale, except for the portion of the tax payable, which should be reported and paid to the public, should be handed over to the troops or people who originally captured the salt to be used as a bonus. Article 5. If it is found that the captured salt is mixed with impurities and does not meet the standard composition of edible salt, the salt affairs authority should report it to the Salt Affairs Administration for submission to the Ministry of Finance for verification. Article 6. If the troops capture salt under one of the following circumstances, the army that captured the salt may dispose of it as appropriate, but the reasons should be stated, and the weight and disposal of the salt should be reported to the Ministry of Finance for verification. (1) The location where the salt is captured is far from the residence of the salt affairs authority, or although it is not far away, the salt cannot be transferred to the salt affairs authority for disposal due to traffic difficulties. (2) Due to military changes, the salt must be disposed of urgently to avoid benefiting the enemy. Article 7. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

The celebration ceremony will include: (1) Offering birthday greetings; (2) Report; (3) Speech; (4) Birthday banquet; (5) Entertainment; (6) Gift-giving.

People from all walks of life cared for the disaster victims, admired Ma Xiangbo's spirit of treating people as if they were his own family, and generously donated. The event continues today at the Commercial Radio Station and is scheduled to close tomorrow night.

Wu Yunzhai's Speech

Wu Yunzhai said in his opening speech at the Continental Radio Station yesterday: Listeners from all walks of life, this time, for Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday, we are holding celebrations all over the country. Today, I want to represent the Preparatory Committee for Publicly Celebrating Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th Birthday to say a few words of blessing. I think Mr. Ma is not only a figure of one county or one province, but a great figure in the country and the world. Mr. Ma is truly a writer, a religious figure, a philanthropist, and a philosopher. He can be said to be a treasure of the country and a blessing among people. We are holding this grand ceremony to celebrate this human treasure of the country, so naturally we must celebrate enthusiastically. However, Mr. Ma himself is concerned about the difficulties of the times and treats the people as if they were his own family. He has repeatedly sent letters, attaching us and sincerely encouraging us to do more good deeds. Therefore, we admire his old man's morality and, starting today, unite the Refugee Relief Association, the Native Place Association Group, the Amateur Group, the Citizens Group, the Broadcasting Committee, the Opera Circle United Association, and colleagues from the film industry to broadcast special programs on Continental Radio and other radio stations for three days to raise funds to help refugees. All those who donate 4 yuan will receive a pair of 100-year birthday bowls, and those who donate 2 yuan will receive a 100-year commemorative badge. More donations will receive more gifts. The birthday bowls and commemorative badges are engraved with Mr. Ma's own calligraphy of the character for longevity, which can be kept as souvenirs. Mr. Ma is a human treasure of the country, and we should pay our respects to him, so I advise everyone to buy a pair of birthday bowls, which can both pay respects and help refugees, which is truly a win-win situation, a favor that does not cost much. Furthermore, the ancients said that the benevolent live long. The reason why Mr. Ma can enjoy such a long life is all due to his lifelong compassionate heart and his eagerness to help those in need. If everyone wants to live a long life, they must follow the example of Mr. Ma. I sincerely wish him good fortune, longevity, and good health from afar, and at the same time, I respectfully wish all listeners the same long life, and hope that you will generously donate to help the refugees, which will be a great merit. Ma Xiangbo's Telegram: Yesterday, the Preparatory Committee for Publicly Celebrating Ma's Birthday received a telegram from Ma Xiangbo in Liangshan, expressing his gratitude. The original telegram reads: To all gentlemen of the Native Place Association, No. 604, Guohua Building, Beijing Road, Han Jingqi, I am ashamed that my age has only increased and I have no way to help the world or benefit the victims. I am deeply honored by your praise and accept your kindness. I hereby send a telegram to express my thanks. Xiangbo bows.

### Flexible Regulations for Organizing Trade Unions: Those Not Meeting the Legal Number of People May Jointly Form a Trade Union

The Executive Yuan of the National Government, in order to strengthen workers' organizations during the Anti-Japanese War, specially instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Communications, stating that the National Government's Instruction No. 84 of February 15, 1939, stipulates that according to the Trade Union Law, vocational trade unions must have 50 or more members, and industrial trade unions must have 100 or more members, in order to organize a trade union. It is now found that except in developed metropolitan areas where there are more workers, most places do not meet the legal number of people. Currently, during the Anti-Japanese War, most workers are unorganized, which is not appropriate and needs to be made flexible in order to meet the needs of organizing the public during this extraordinary time while maintaining the law. It has now been resolved by the 24th meeting of the Central Standing Committee that, regarding the organization of trade unions, vocational and industrial workers in areas that do not meet the legal number of people are specially allowed to jointly organize a trade union, and those that comply with the provisions of Article 1 of the Trade Union Law shall still comply with the regulations. In addition to the meeting distributing the information, it should be recorded and sent to the relevant authorities for reference. Accordingly, it should be done immediately. In addition to instructing the department to reply, the order is hereby issued to the said court to inform and take note of it.

### Postal and Remittance Bureau Employees Request Subsidies

The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has recently been dispatching personnel to Kunming, Guiyang, Chongqing, and other places to open branches due to the development of its business. The employees in Shanghai are experiencing increasingly high living costs due to the high prices in the isolated island, and their salaries are low (some are at the 12 yuan or 18 yuan level), which is not enough to cover expenses. It is heard that all the employees have submitted a report to the authorities, earnestly requesting subsidies according to the methods of postal bureaus and banks, in order to alleviate their difficulties. If this is not achieved, they plan to send a telegram to the bureau director to petition.

### Xiong Guisong Repays Kindness with Enmity; Incites Thugs to Assassinate; Yang Zaisan is Shot at but Survives; Thugs are Arrested on the Spot and Confess the Inside Story

Yang Zaisan, a gentleman from Changshu, is in his sixties and has lived in the western countryside of Changshu for generations. He is known in his hometown for his generosity and willingness to help others. Yang has a son named Xingfang, who is over thirty years old and has his father's spirit and patriotic enthusiasm. When the "August 13th" incident occurred, Changshu fell, and Xingfang was ordered to organize a guerrilla team, serving as the commander. Many enthusiastic people from the four villages in the area came to join him. Since then, they have created problems for the Japanese army. At that time, the commander of the third detachment under Xingfang was Xiong Guisong from Hubei. According to records, Xiong lost his parents when he was eight years old and wandered to Changshu. At that time, Xingfang and Zaisan took him in and raised him until he grew up, married, and had children, all of which were done by Zaisan alone. Zaisan even treated Xiong as his own son, so this time, Xingfang entrusted him with important tasks, placing his confidence in him, hoping that Xiong would be grateful and repay his kindness, and even serve the country. Unexpectedly, Xiong's human nature was unpredictable and his ambition was wolfish. Not only did he not know how to repay kindness with virtue, but he even repaid virtue with enmity. He even colluded with the Japanese side by taking advantage of his position and, like Zhang Song offering a map, led the enemy to attack Xingfang's base. Xingfang was caught off guard and suffered a terrible defeat. The headquarters was defeated, and his home was destroyed by the enemy. Xingfang escaped bravely with his life. Before long, Xingfang gathered his old troops again and expanded them even further, and his power doubled. So he led the crowd to counterattack, and as a result, drove the enemy away and recovered his homeland. The ungrateful Xiong Guisong also disintegrated as a result. Xiong fled to Shanghai and settled in Hongkou, becoming a pawn of the tiger. Until recently, Yang Zaisan came to Shanghai to discuss important matters and heard that he was staying in room 608 of the Da Hu Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. Yesterday, around noon, Yang and two friends went to the Juxing Restaurant in Baoyu Lane for lunch. At 12:30, just as he was slowly walking out of the restaurant, a thug suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, pulled out a pistol, and shot at Yang. There was a loud bang, but the result was unknown. The gun fired by the thug only made a sound but had no bullets, so Yang was not injured at all. The nearby police officers had heard the sound and rushed to the scene, chasing and capturing the thug, and taking him to the police station. According to his confession, his surname is Zhou, he is 41 years old, from Siyang, and he is now working as a puppet police officer in Hongkou. He also directly admitted that his coming to kill Yang was entirely instigated by Xiong Guisong. The thug also claimed that after receiving Xiong's order, he had been waiting at the Rongfa Inn in Baoyu Lane for several days.

### The Worry of Impotence in Spring

— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Everything is renewed in spring, and which girl does not yearn for spring; who says that the love between husband and wife is like lacquer? Once impotence occurs, they go their separate ways!

What is called impotence? It is a kind of disease in the physiology of men. It is also one of the reproductive disorders for middle-aged men. Patients naturally feel very painful in their minds, and marital life may also be broken. This article first describes the various theories about impotence, and then talks about the corresponding treatment strategies. All men with impotence, or aggrieved women who are married to impotent husbands, can take it as a reference.

The center of the reproductive reflex function is in the lumbar part of the spinal cord. What connects this center to arouse the excitement of the reflex is the peripheral nerve, which is called the afferent nerve. The sensory nerves distributed in and around the genitals, and the nerves sent out from this center, are called efferent nerves, which originate from the first, second, and third sacral nerves, mix with the sympathetic nerves, and are distributed in the cavernous body of the penis filled with blood vessels. Once it expands, it fills the cavernous body with blood. Any irritation of the peripheral genital sensory nerves will immediately cause a reflex.

The most patients with impotence are, of course, the elderly. This is due to physiological reasons, which are caused by the decrease of the excitability of the center. If it is a young person, in addition to excessive sex or masturbation causing kidney deficiency, those who usually smoke and drink can also develop impotence because the sexual center is poisoned by tobacco and alcohol. However, drinking a little can invigorate the performance, but this is no different from drinking poison to quench thirst, so it is not allowed for health.

The results of research by venereal disease experts in various countries now prove that this disease is caused by masturbation and indulgence more than other reasons, because the puberty gland in the testicles is injured and ages prematurely. However, at this time of bright spring, birds are singing and flowers are fragrant, and people are the spirits of all things. Once this is considered, the fun of the boudoir is completely lost, which is really worrying!

However, from the results of years of research, the most effective drug in clinical practice is the German "Betecamp," a genuine chimpanzee testicular sperm preparation for men. In 1934, the famous French doctor Dr. Flange had made dozens of chemical tests on the ingredients of "Betecamp", proving that the testicular sperm system it contains is ten times more than various similar products on the market, and it also contains brain phosphorus, which is most suitable for those with neurasthenia, premature ejaculation and impotence, insomnia and forgetfulness, infertility after marriage, and incomplete development. Its female "Butecamp" is a gynecological panacea, which is most effective in regulating menstruation.

### Various Treatments for Spermatorrhea

— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany

In the letters from readers asking about diseases! It has been found that those who suffer from spermatorrhea due to masturbation, and those who lose their health due to spermatorrhea, or those who suffer from asthenia due to excessive spermatorrhea, account for more than 75%. It can be seen that so many young people are troubled by spermatorrhea. In addition to answering in detail in separate letters, the treatment of this disease will be further elaborated in this article.

To stop spermatorrhea, the first thing to do is to quit masturbation. Those with mild symptoms can rub the area with cold water before going to bed, avoid smoking and alcohol, strictly observe health preservation, and take "Names Spermatol Stop Tablets" to completely cure it. Those with worsening symptoms, such as seminal emission or seminal emission upon seeing color, in addition to the above-mentioned treatments, have also suffered from neurasthenia, insomnia and forgetfulness, headache and dizziness, and also have kidney deficiency and premature ejaculation, back pain, and incomplete development. No matter how severe the symptoms are, after taking the German Testicular Sperm Preparation "Butecamp" for men, they can be completely cured. It can also cultivate and replenish losses. "Names Spermatol Stop Tablets" are the most advanced and effective treatment for spermatorrhea. The drug's function of consolidating the essence gate and reducing its hypersensitivity has long been praised by doctors in various countries.

Modern Medicine

### Modern Treatment of Gonorrhea

— Described by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine from the United States

Science is changing with each passing day, and the truths that have been discovered are timeless. This can be proved by the invention of the gonorrhea specific drug "Klingnon".

The drug "Klingnon" was invented by Dr. Peter, a master of gonorrhea in Germany. Dr. Peter devoted his life's energy and countless money to finally base it on non-specific therapy, using a protein body yellow mixture. After countless animal experiments, such as first inoculating apes with gonorrhea, and then administering the original element of "Klingnon", it was cured within five days. Later, it was tested on various animals and gradually improved, and finally became a gonorrhea specific drug popular all over the world today.

Now let's briefly talk about the condition of gonorrhea, so that patients can also understand the truth. The root of gonorrhea is the diplococcus (originally named for its appearance like two balls stacked on top of each other), which is extremely stubborn and highly reproductive, one turns into two, two turns into four, and in the blink of an eye, it has turned into thousands of followers. Therefore, if we unfortunately come into contact with unclean women, gonorrhea often occurs within three or four days. At this time, the gonococci are still densely concentrated in the anterior urethra, so it is very easy to treat at this time. The results of my clinical experiments show that those who take "Klingnon" during acute gonorrhea are effective on the same day and completely cured within a week. As for chronic gonorrhea, if the patient has already developed prostatitis, cystitis, seminal duct inflammation, orchitis, etc., it is more difficult to treat than acute gonorrhea because the gonococci have invaded the posterior urethra and its internal divergence. If the gonococci break into the blood from the cavernous body, it will become gonococcal arthritis. This kind of patient cannot be treated with general over-the-counter drugs. You must take "Klingnon" to make every cell in your body have an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect and be completely cured. Only "Klingnon" has this effect. In addition, if men use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally according to the diagrams and instructions, and women use "Carldy Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories, inserting one tablet into the cavity every night to remove gonococcal leukorrhea, it is especially suitable for self-treatment at home. This is the most modern method of treating gonorrhea.

### Examples of Tuberculosis Treatment

— Diagnosis by Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Patient Qian Xueliang, a native of Songjiang, is 41 years old (self-reported). He has a weak physique and likes alcohol. In the winter of the year before last, he attended a friend's wedding banquet, got drunk and returned, and felt cold at night. Since then, he has been coughing non-stop. By last spring, he had a lot of thick phlegm and felt a stabbing pain in his chest. Although he had been treated, it was ineffective. Last autumn, blood spots suddenly appeared in the phlegm, and he had night sweats, so he came to me for treatment. (Treatment Experience) I observed that Mr. Qian's complexion was pale, he was skinny, and he had a high fever. X-rays revealed that there was a cavity the size of a silver coin in the right lung lobe. I told him to avoid alcohol and eat nutritious food, and to rest at home. I gave him "Pulmonal" to fill the cavity and kill the tuberculosis bacteria. Two months later, the cough was cured, and the chest pain and night sweats were gone. After taking it until now, all the symptoms have disappeared, no blood sputum has been found, and his health has been restored.

### Incomparable Pain

The phrase "incomparable pain" can be used to describe the pain of gonorrhea most appropriately. Because most people think that the pain of gonorrhea is the most severe during acute gonorrhea, they neglect the treatment of chronic gonorrhea. The reason is that chronic gonorrhea is not as painful as acute gonorrhea, so they just let it go. However, this is not the case. Although the pain during acute gonorrhea is unbearable, it is not a terrible consequence, because this is a physiological battle against gonococci, and the pain is a physiological reaction, which is not to be feared. The question is how to eradicate these gonococci that cause painful reactions. If the pathogens have been eradicated, then the pain can be fundamentally solved, and the gonorrhea that makes people suffer can be eliminated.

Unfortunately, most patients lack medical knowledge and only know how to treat the symptoms, begging for temporary pain relief. As a result, many difficult-to-treat stubborn gonorrhea arise. Although the pain has subsided, the hidden dangers are deepening, and there is often a situation where it breaks out and cannot be saved. The most obvious example is gonococcal prostatitis. During acute gonorrhea, it is very painful, but after this period, it enters the chronic period, and the patient feels almost no symptoms. This kind of painless gonorrhea is much more dangerous than painful gonorrhea. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment lies in eradicating the gonococci in the deep parts. The drug "Klingnon" can resist and kill the gonococci in the deep parts of the antibacterial tissue, so it is very suitable for all kinds of gonorrhea. In addition, turning to German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy are used alternately, so that the leucorrhea that general doctors find difficult to deal with can be fundamentally solved in a short period of time. This is the most reasonable and ideal treatment for gonorrhea that I have found in the past 20 years, and it is also the most satisfactory one in the world. From today onwards, I will see 20 patients a day, and each number will only cost five corners.

### Husband Has an Affair with His Wife's Younger Sister; Wife Reports Him to the Police; Instead, She Confesses that It Was with Her Consent; Shameless Men and Women Sentenced to Four Months of Imprisonment

Xia Changyu, a native of Wuxi, is 30 years old this year. He used to run a bank in Suzhou. Recently, he has been idle. In 1928, he married Xue Huaishan (31 years old this year), a woman from the same township, through a matchmaker. The relationship between the husband and wife was very close, and they had five children. Since the outbreak of the war, the family has had a lot of assets. Because their hometown fell, they came to Shanghai to take refuge and rented a house at No. 25 Qingshun Lane, Beijing Road. Xue's younger sister, Xue Qi, 24 years old this year, is beautiful and petite. Her parents are now deceased. She often visits her sister, and over time, she meets her brother-in-law Xia Changyu. Friendship develops into love. Recently, they rented a house at No. 12 Gujia Lane, No. 51 Hualong Road, in the French Concession, and started living together. Since Xia lived with his younger sister-in-law Xue Qi, he abandoned his wife and children, unwilling to care for them. Recently, Xia's wife, Xia Xue Huaishan, found out their address. Unable to contain her jealousy, she hired lawyer Fang Jiazhen to represent her and reported to the French police at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. Detective Wu Wengang accompanied her to the address to catch the adulterers. They found Xia Changyu and Xue Qi sleeping in the same bed, not yet up. So they both got up, got dressed, and were taken to the police station. After interrogation, they were escorted to the Criminal Division 8 of the Special Court at 3:00 p.m. on the same day. Judge Wu Kechou brought them to trial. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the French Concession Administration, prosecuted them for adultery and harming the family. The plaintiff, Xia Xue Huaishan, arrived in court with her lawyer, presented her marriage certificate, and claimed that her husband had committed adultery with her sister. She did not know about it before and only found out about it in December of last year. She found out their whereabouts in January of this year, but her attempts to stop them were ineffective. She requested a strict investigation. When asked, Xia Changyu admitted to having an affair with his younger sister-in-law and that the relationship started in 1936. At that time, his wife, because he was fooling around outside, used her sister to get to know him in order to stop him from wandering outside. Moreover, his parents-in-law were alive at the time and knew about it and acquiesced to it. Now she is suddenly accusing him, and there is another purpose. Xue Qi confessed that she had her sister's consent to live with her brother-in-law and that they had interacted with each other. After verifying the confession in court, the judge ordered the defense to be opened, then announced the end of the trial, and sentenced Xia Changyu for having an affair with a person while having a spouse, and Xue Qi for having an affair with a person, to four months of imprisonment each as a warning. During the appeal period, they were detained in the detention center. The two defendants' request for bail was denied.

### Russian Police Officer Accidentally Discharges a Handgun; Chinese Police Officer Dies from the Bullet; Whether It Was a Vendetta Remains to Be Investigated

Yan Rushan, a Chinese police officer No. 726 of the Xiaodongmen Police Station in the French Concession, 31 years old this year, from Shandong, lived at No. 325 Xinxin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road. At 10:40 a.m. yesterday, Officer Yan was dispatched to stand guard with a Russian patrol officer No. 197 (name unknown) next to the iron gate at the intersection of Zhoushan Road and Minguo Road, from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. At this time, the Russian officer suddenly took out his handgun to wipe it, forgetting that there was a bullet left in the barrel that had not been removed. As a result, he accidentally touched the trigger while wiping it, and the bullet in the gun was fired. Because he was standing very close to Officer Yan No. 726, and the muzzle was still pointing at Officer Yan, the bullet hit Officer Yan's chest, and he fell to the ground immediately, bleeding profusely. The Xiaodongmen Police Station was notified and immediately called an ambulance to rush the injured Officer Yan to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, because the injury was fatal, he died on the way. After arriving at the hospital, the doctor examined him and transferred the body to the autopsy room attached to the Labor Bureau Hospital on Turas Road (commonly known as the Small Hospital) to await autopsy. At the same time, the General Police Station sent Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to investigate and took the Russian officer No. 197 who caused the accident into custody for interrogation. According to the Russian officer, when he was on duty, he saw Officer Yan No. 726 wiping his handgun, so he also took out his handgun to wipe it, forgetting that there was a bullet in the gun, which caused the accidental firing. The police station is investigating whether the two men had a vendetta. The cause of the accident needs to be investigated. The Russian officer who caused the accident has been ordered to be detained pending a detailed investigation. It is heard that the deceased has an elderly mother, wife, and children. The police station has submitted a report to the police department to report to the superiors to discuss giving them a pension for their future livelihood problems.

### The Recent Trend of Embezzlement is Rampant: Mostly to Support Gambling Dens; Silk Shop Employee Arrested for Stealing a Large Quantity of Silk, Sentenced to One Year and Six Months

The He Fa Silk Shop at No. 59, Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, has recently experienced repeated incidents of stored silk fabrics being stolen. After a thorough investigation, it was discovered that the thief was Zhang Gen, a Cantonese employee of the shop. The stolen silk fabrics were worth 3,000 yuan in legal tender, totaling as many as 98 bolts. The shop's management, based on information received, had the Lao Zha Gate Police Station arrest Zhang. The First Special District Local Court ordered his detention pending further investigation and retrieval of the stolen goods. The Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case have spent several days investigating various pawnshops and second-hand shops. As a result, 97 bolts of the stolen silk have been recovered, with only one bolt still missing. The Ai'erjin Road Tongkang Sheng Foreign Cloth Shop received the most of these stolen goods, amounting to 64 bolts. The Hengmao Pawnshop on Rue Wagner in the French Concession had 11 bolts recovered. The rest were recovered in small quantities from other places. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Zhang Gen to the court, where Judge Zhong Qing continued the interrogation. First, the police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, explained the process of investigating and recovering the stolen goods. Then, the representative of the victim filed a case requesting the return of the stolen goods. According to the court's records, the defendant Zhang Gen confessed that he had stolen the silk in eight or nine separate instances. He initially pawned them, obtaining a total of 1,375 yuan, and later sold the pawn tickets for an additional 303 yuan. However, he stated that all the money had been spent. It is reported that most of the money was spent at gambling dens such as Hollywood and Rongsheng in western Shanghai. Recently, cases of salary-earning classes embezzling company funds and stealing assets, almost all of which are caused by addiction to gambling dens in the Western District. Zhang Gen has also followed this path. After the interrogation, Judge Zhong sentenced him to one year and six months of imprisonment. The stolen goods were ordered to be returned to their respective possessors.

### Public Restroom Becomes a Gambling Den: Dance Hall Manager Sentenced to Three Months for Installing "Slot Machines" as a Warning

The International Dance Hall, which has long been prohibited by the police from operating "slot machine" gambling, has recently resumed doing so secretly. However, the gambling equipment, the slot machines, has been moved from a conspicuous location to a secluded toilet. This allows patrons who enter the restroom to relieve themselves to indulge in gambling during their moments of bodily release. Originally, the restroom was a place that no one wished to enter unless in dire need. However, since the installation of this equipment, the number of people entering and exiting has suddenly increased, with shoulders rubbing against shoulders and heels treading on heels, resembling the bustling scene on Shanyin Road. The originator of this scheme had unconventional ideas and made huge profits daily. However, the number of those who emptied their pockets while squatting is difficult to count. Soon, this secret gradually came to light. Li Ruikang, the deputy chief of the Lao Zha Gate Police Station in charge of the area, went to the dance hall incognito on the night of the 20th of last month. Taking advantage of the opportunity to relieve himself, he inspected the premises and confirmed the gambling operation. In addition to taking the gambling equipment back to the police station, the police department filed a lawsuit against Chen Juyi, the Cantonese manager of the International Dance Hall, for operating a gambling den. Yesterday, the First Special District Local Court summoned the defendant, who was immediately interrogated by the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu, who presented the facts of the defendant's crime and requested punishment. Judge Zhong Qing interrogated the defendant and sentenced Chen Juyi to three months of imprisonment. If a fine is substituted, it will be at a rate of two yuan per day. The automatic gambling machine was confiscated.

### Customs Broker Emits Bad Checks

Zhuang Jinbiao, the owner of Jin He Company, age 44, hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District against Zhan Tailai, the owner of Taiguchang Customs Broker at No. 18, Yong'an Lane, Yong'an Street, for issuing bad checks, requesting a legal investigation and pursuing payment of the check amount in a civil suit. It is alleged that in March of last year, the Sanbei Company paid a check issued by the defendant dated April 30, 1938, drawn on the Yongyushen Ji Qianzhuang [Money Exchange] for 2,000 yuan in national currency, and another check dated March 31 of the same year, drawn on the Tongyuyong Ji Qianzhuang for 2,000 yuan in national currency, totaling 4,000 yuan. Upon maturity, the checks were presented to the Qianzhuang for payment but were refused due to insufficient funds and returned. Despite repeated negotiations and demands for payment from the drawer, the defendant, for a year now, he has ignored them. Therefore, he has been forced to file a lawsuit requesting an investigation according to the Negotiable Instruments Law, and a civil suit to recover the 4,000 yuan in check amount plus interest. According to the court records, Judge Jiang Liquan opened the hearing yesterday morning. Both parties were represented by lawyers. After questioning by the court, the case was adjourned for further investigation.

### Chinese Police Officer Swallows Gold Bars While Inspecting Passengers: Sentenced to One Year and Six Months

Ma Zhongzhen (from Henan), Chinese police officer No. 412 of the French Concession Police Station, on the afternoon of the 23rd of last month at approximately 5 p.m., inspected passengers disembarking from the Wuxue steamer on the Bund. He found 38 taels and 7 qian of gold bars (about three bars) on Chen Jinshan, a resident of Taiyu. Suspecting that the gold bars were stolen goods, he took Chen to the police station. The Chinese police officer only turned in one gold bar, having swallowed the other two gold bars and depositing them at a relative's house in Tongan Lane, Metheus Road. The police station discovered this, and Ma Zhongzhen was summoned to the police station for detention and investigation. As a result of the investigation, Ma Zhongzhen was publicly prosecuted for embezzlement. Yesterday, Judge Miao Qingbang presided over a special court session to hear the case. The defendant admitted to attempting to swallow the gold bars. After the court deliberations, Ma Zhongzhen was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment.

### Apprentice Dies from Poisoning

Yu Quangen, a 20-year-old apprentice from Suzhou at the Gu Yinji Tailor Shop at No. 42, Qingchang Lane, Avenue Edward VII, for unknown reasons, took his own life by consuming poison the other night.

### Famous American Adventurer Halliburton is Missing: Attempting to Cross the Pacific in a Sailboat

American adventurer Halliburton set out from Hong Kong in early February aboard the Chinese sailing junk "Sea Dragon" (transliteration), attempting a daring crossing of the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco, USA. After sending out a distress message on February 25th, there has been no news. The US authorities chartered a Clipper aircraft to search the area of the Pacific Ocean by air, using radio to locate him. According to crew members of the President Coolidge, which arrived in Shanghai on the 4th, the ship passed through the area where the Sea Dragon encountered danger but did not see the distressed Chinese sailboat. It is generally believed that Halliburton's chances of survival are slim.

### No "Iron Blood Assassination Corps" in This City

In recent days, this city has seen instances of people extorting money under the false name of the "Iron Blood Assassination Corps." The incident occurred at a sack store on Xin Zha Road. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Resistance War, the store has been continuously collecting sacks and selling them to a certain party for military use, making a profit of 150,000 yuan. Recently, it opened two new branches near Xin Zha Bridge Road to expand its business. The store owner, having become wealthy, began to indulge in pleasure, taking two prostitutes as concubines in addition to his legal wife, and frequently visiting brothels in Huile Lane, Sanyuanfang, and other places. Recently, the corps sent a letter to the store warning him and extorting 60,000 yuan in national currency. The store then hired someone to mediate, settling the matter for 600 yuan. It was later discovered that there is no such organization in Shanghai. According to sources in Chongqing, this type of incident has repeatedly occurred in the occupied territories. In fact, those who supply goods to the enemy and those who extort money under the guise of patriotism are traitors to the nation and the race. It is hoped that compatriots in all regions will conduct their own inspections and pay attention, etc.

### The First Special District Court Continues Strict Security Measures: Vigilant Day and Night Without the Slightest Relaxation

Due to rumors that the puppet organization will take action against the First Special District Court, the Public Concession authorities, adhering to their policy of safeguarding the court's complete legal authority, dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives on the first of this month to collaborate with the Scottish Defense Force in maintaining strict security inside and outside the court. This has been going on for many days, but the Concession authorities have not relaxed in the slightest.

### A Miniature City God Temple

In the old days, the City God Temple was filled with hundreds of plays and all kinds of goods, which was a popular destination for people in Shanghai. Now, the City God Temple market on Luzon Road is a miniature version of the original. Doctors, fortune tellers, food stalls, and toys are interspersed throughout. Therefore, those who enjoy it are constantly coming and going. Inferior goods are unavoidable, but not as bad as rumored. Among them, the national product toys made by Kangyuan Canning Factory are bright and beautiful. Other domestically made daily necessities and local products from various regions can also be found. It is heard that since the market authorities issued a notice to encourage the sale of national products in the position of the management office, merchants have promised to pay attention when purchasing goods in the future. A certain department store mistakenly purchased inferior combs, but after being pointed out by customers, they were put aside and not sold. If enthusiastic people provide timely advice, they will be able to gradually clean up the market. The candies made by the newly established Caizhi Xiang are purely Suzhou-style and are especially loved by those who are fond of them. Sitting in the tea room of the Baihua Hall and tasting Pulo food is also a pleasure.

### Central Geng款 [Boxer Indemnity] Committee: Overview of Assistance to Education and Culture (Part 1) - Subsidies for Higher Education and Education in Southwest and Northwest China

(Chongqing Correspondence) Since its establishment in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], the Board of Trustees for the Administration of the British Boxer Indemnity Refund has spared no effort in assisting educational and cultural undertakings at home and abroad. It has also established standards for the distribution of interest, dividing educational and cultural undertakings into five categories: Category A includes the Central Library and Museum and the preservation of domestic cultural relics and historical sites; Category B includes institutions of higher education and research; Category C includes the British Examinations and cultural undertakings related to China and Britain; Category D includes textbooks and specialized works; and Category E includes primary and secondary education, vocational education, special education, frontier education, and midwifery education. The allocation of interest income over the years has been based on these categories. In recent years, with the outbreak of the War of Resistance, domestic educational and cultural undertakings have been either destroyed or forced to halt, and educational research talents have been displaced and their work interrupted. In view of this, the Board has strived to provide relief. The following is an overview of the educational and cultural undertakings subsidized by the Board over the years, as well as the relief efforts it has recently undertaken itself, highlighting the most important aspects: (1) Subsidies for Higher Education and Education in the Southwest; (2) Subsidies for Education in the Northwest; (3) Sending Students to Study in Britain at Public Expense; (4) Subsidies for University Professors in Border Provinces and the Interior; (5) Assistance to Scientific Workers; (6) Scientific Research Assistants; (7) Organizing Scientific Expeditions. These are described as follows:

(1) Subsidies for Higher Education and Education in the Southwest

Over the years, the Board has allocated special funds to domestic higher education and research institutions to subsidize construction and equipment costs, and to establish professorships, focusing on the four disciplines of agriculture, engineering, medicine, and science. The total amount has reached more than ten million yuan. Since the July 7th Incident [Marco Polo Bridge Incident] and the fall of Beiping [Beijing] and Tianjin to the war zone, universities have successively suspended classes. In order to provide relief, the Ministry of Education established two temporary universities, which are now the Southwest Associated University and the Northwest United University. The Board subsidized the opening expenses of 500,000 yuan. Furthermore, many medical schools in the war zone have been destroyed or forced to shut down, while medical education is particularly urgent during the War of Resistance. The Ministry of Education has specially established the National Guiyang Medical College, which was also subsidized by the Board with 90,000 yuan for opening expenses. In addition to allocating funds to promote education in the Northwest, the Board also plans to assist in the construction of a library in Kunming and to subsidize the establishment of a science museum in Guiyang in the Southwest. Furthermore, it plans to select sites in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces to establish one middle school and one normal school in each province in order to promote education in the Southwest.

(2) Subsidies for Education in the Northwest

The Board has always paid close attention to education in the Northwest. In the 25th year of the Republic [1936], it resolved to subsidize 200,000 yuan for educational expenses in the four provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Suiyuan. In August of that year, it hired experts to conduct on-site inspections. In the 26th year [1937], it hired experts again to conduct another inspection. They traveled extensively in Gansu, Qinghai, and other provinces for several months. Regarding the subsidy for education in the Northwest, a concrete plan was formulated, which has now been implemented in the following areas: (1) Subsidies for education in Gansu, mainly in the establishment of the Gansu Science Education Museum in Lanzhou. For the sake of convenience, the museum is run directly by the Board. The internal organization is divided into two groups: natural sciences and social sciences. The purpose of the museum is to promote and improve science teaching in secondary schools in Gansu Province and to arouse public interest in science. Preparations began last summer, and it was officially established on New Year's Day this year. Mei Yishi, Dean of the College of Arts at Yenching University, was appointed as the director. The annual budget is approximately 90,000 yuan. (2) Subsidies for education in Qinghai, mainly in the establishment of a complete middle school with an attached primary school in Xining, which is also run directly by the Board, named the Huangchuan Middle School of the British Boxer Indemnity Refund Board. Last summer, it enrolled one class each of senior high school, junior high school, and senior primary school, and two classes of junior primary school, totaling 230 students. Wang Wenjun was appointed as the principal. The estimated annual budget is approximately 50,000 yuan. (3) In addition, subsidies are provided to Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Suiyuan, and other provinces for books, instruments, vocational education, health education, and Mongolian and Tibetan education expenses in primary and secondary schools, totaling 50,000 yuan this year. (4) In order to emphasize ethnic minority education in the border provinces, the Board recently allocated another 50,000 yuan to establish a middle school in Suzhou, Gansu. Wu Liangfu has been appointed as the director of preparations and is preparing to enroll students and open the school in the summer of this year. For the design and supervision of the above projects, the Board has formed a Design Committee for Subsidizing Education in the Northwest, appointing nine members to be responsible for the work. The committee's office is located in Lanzhou. In total, the Board has been subsidizing and operating educational undertakings in the Northwest for three years, and the scale is roughly in place. The total expenditure has reached more than 400,000 yuan. (To be continued)

### Education Section of the Refugee Association Changes to Education Office and Moves to the Association's Office

The Education Section of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association recently moved to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association at 93 Guangdong Road because the original address on Yuanmingyuan Road was insufficient. The section has been renamed the Education Office with the approval of the Association, as the education of refugees is becoming increasingly important and the current scope seems too small, necessitating expansion. It is said that this will contribute more to the education of refugees in the future.

### Canadian Basketball Team Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday - First Game: Defeats American Children - Wins by 4 Points, 21 to 17 - Tonight at 8:30 PM: Battle with Giants

The Kobe Canadian School basketball team, a group of eleven people led by coach Austin, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM on the Canadian Empress. After disembarking, they drove to the American School, rested briefly, and then practiced on the court. At 4:45 PM, the team played their first game in Shanghai against the American School in the American School gymnasium, resulting in a 21 to 17 victory. The second game is scheduled for 8:30 PM tonight at the West YMCA against the West YMCA Giants. According to coach Austin, "This time, I led the team to Shanghai during spring break to exchange skills with various middle school teams, and I especially want to compete with Chinese schools. However, we arrived one day late due to fog along the way, so we were unable to compete with Jinan last night (i.e., the night before last). The team will leave Shanghai on Saturday or next Monday, which is still undecided, so we may be able to make up the game with Jinan on Saturday night."

Strength of the Canadian Team: The Canadian team members are young and strong, but their basketball skills are not particularly outstanding, roughly similar to those of Jizhong Middle School. Compared with Guoguang Middle School, they are not as good. In yesterday's game against the American School, both sides appeared flustered after contact, and it took a long time to score. In the first quarter, the American School led 4 to 3. In the first quarter, the American School suffered a setback. The Canadian team's Shiffley and the Clark brothers scored successively, suddenly increasing by ten points. The American School gained nothing. In the first half, they led remotely with a score of 13 to 4. After switching sides, the American School worked hard to counterattack. In the second and third quarters, Canada had 15, and the American School had 10. In the fourth quarter, the Canadian team transferred the Japanese Yamada to the court, and the position changed and shook. The American School took the opportunity to attack, forcing it to 17 to 19. The American School was only two points behind. Only one minute was left before the end of the game. The American School struggled desperately, intending to turn defeat into victory. Unexpectedly, things went against their wishes, and the Canadian J. Clark scored another goal. The silver whistle blew for a long time, and the Canadian team defeated the American School by a score of 21 to 17. The results of yesterday's game are as follows:

### Reminiscence of Loyal Martyrs: Zhengyi Green Dumplings

— Xue Yihe

Green dumplings are a very common snack, of course not as noble as the Western pastries in coffee shops, nor as pleasing to the young masters and ladies as toast, pudding, and cream cake, but in the eyes of people in our hometown, they are simply the best snacks. Although this kind of cheap snack can always be seen in various pastry shops in spring or during the Qingming Festival, it is far less delicious and beautiful than those made in Zhengyi. As for why Zhengyi green dumplings are so popular, it is not only because their color is as emerald green and lovely as jade, and the powder is pure, fine, smooth, and glutinous, with thin shells and many fillings, but also because there is a meaning of remembrance of loyal martyrs in the circulation of the dumplings.

According to the elders of my hometown, "During the Ming Dynasty, there was a Zhou Daoxing, who lived in Yangzhuang Township, Naxiang Town. His father's name was Shi Pei, and he was a martial artist. He was recommended to Fujian, and Prince Yongming appointed him as the garrison commander of Zhangzhou. Daoxing was then granted the position of Qianzong. Daoxing was extraordinary in courage and strategy, and was good at using a long spear. At the age of twenty-five, he suddenly heard that the situation in Fujian was urgent, so he set off for his post. Before he left, he bid farewell to his wife, saying, "I am willing to die for my country, do not expect me to return." He entered Zhangzhou through a secret passage, and every battle was victorious. At that time, the army was short of rations, and Daoxing was ordered to deliver three thousand carts to Nanning, leading fifty soldiers, and passing through Caoping North forty miles in the middle of the night. Suddenly, they encountered mountain bandits robbing them. Daoxing fought and killed the bandit leader, and the crowd fled. More than a thousand bandits绕道狞至, Daoxing复大败诸贼, Then, Daoxing defeated the bandits, but looking back, the grain carts were long gone. Daoxing looked up to the sky and shouted, then committed suicide and died, buried in the green grass. Later generations remembered his loyalty and martyrdom, and every year during the Qingming Festival, they took wheatgrass juice to make dumplings to commemorate him."

Before the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, Zhengyi green dumplings were the only good gift to be presented to those who came to Zhengyi for sightseeing or to those from the same hometown who were working away from home. I remember when I was a child, there was an old woman surnamed Chen in the town, who inherited her mother's Zhao family method, and the ones she made were even more famous. The elders of my hometown once said, "Liu's tofu dry, Zhao's dumplings, Mo's Yangcheng crabs, Chen's washing brushes," all referring to the famous local products of my hometown. This also shows the fame of the green dumplings.

### How to Choose and Make Clothes

— Jingzhen

When making a new garment, it is best to have a predetermined standard in mind. Once you have a clear plan, then go out to purchase the materials and tailor the garment. This can save time and money, and you will surely be more satisfied with the finished product. Therefore, I am providing the following points for housewives to consider.

(1) It should be appropriate for your age—The style and color of clothing are related to an individual's age. If a young girl's clothes are dull in color and old-fashioned in style, they will definitely look prematurely aged and unattractive. However, if a sixty or seventy-year-old woman wears bright pink or light green, overly fashionable clothes, it will also be a thankless effort.

(2) It should complement your figure—Everyone has different heights, weights, and body shapes. When choosing and making clothes, you should conduct individual research. Strive to discover the secret of "lengthening what is short" and "enhancing beauty while concealing flaws." Loose clothes do not look good on thin people, and tight clothes are uncomfortable for overweight people. In addition, horizontal or vertical stripes on clothing can give people a tall or wide, unfavorable impression. Short, plump women and long-legged women should pay attention to this.

(3) Colors should be harmonious—When choosing clothing materials, you must pay attention to your skin tone. People with fair complexions should not wear yellow clothes. Tan, blue, green, and other dark colors are all suitable. However, people with overly pale complexions should not wear black clothes. People with rosy complexions should avoid red and yellow clothes; light or other plain colors are more appropriate, and very deep brown-chestnut colors can also be worn. People with slightly dark complexions should not wear brown clothes. Any other color is suitable, with light white being the best. If the complexion is very dark, you should choose very strong colors when making clothes.

(4) Styles should be appealing—Clothing should not only pay attention to color but also to style. Often, very good materials are ruined due to improper tailoring, which is a pity. Clothing affects appearance, so styles should not be too strange, but rather exquisite, generous, elegant, and appealing, suitable for aesthetic concepts. When studying or working outside, you want classmates or colleagues to not find it annoying, and when working at home, you still want classmates or colleagues to be pleased when they see it.

(5) It should be comfortable and well-fitting—Comfort and fit are principles in clothing. Clothes are originally meant to protect the body, so naturally, you want them to be comfortable. Therefore, if you find the collar too high or uncomfortable, you can lower it a bit. If the sleeves and edges are too long and get in the way, making you feel uncomfortable when working or walking, you can shorten them. If you only care about making the style attractive, ending up with restricted arm and leg movements and a constricted body, then you have lost the original purpose of wearing clothes.

### Random Travel Memories

Ai Li

In late Qing Dynasty, when I lived in Hangzhou, I once accompanied my husband to Feilai Peak in Liu San. The clear streams and rapid currents were secluded and lovely. Lingyin Temple was on the side of the Jiong Long Bridge. The rock ledge was sparse and open, with a sky cave above, now called "A Thread of Sky." At the cave entrance, Sun Xueju’s inscription in official script, titled with twenty-two characters, each character more than three inches in diameter, dating back to the Wanli Dingyou year. My husband stared at it for a long time before moving on. Sometimes, he would ride alone into the mountains, visiting cranes and searching for plum blossoms, enjoying the beauty of the lake and mountains to the fullest. The monks at the temple were very hospitable. When they asked how many people were there, he said: Only I. The monks were greatly alarmed, saying that mountain bandits were unpredictable here, and that he should not travel alone in the future. My husband simply smiled. Upon returning home, he described the scenery as beautiful and clear, the stream paths secluded and deep, with clear springs flowing on the ground, their sound gurgling, leading one's thoughts afar. The lake and mountain scenery complemented each other, the best being the dense bamboo forest standing on both sides, making one almost forget to return. As dusk fell and the sound of scattered bells was heard, he would awaken and return on horseback. At that time, I also loved to travel, but due to my weak health, I dared not follow him. Thinking about it now, I regret not doing so.

In the autumn of the third year of the Republic, I accompanied my husband to Tianping. It was more than thirty miles from the city. We hired a small boat before dawn, with boatmen as guides. Before reaching the mountain by three or four miles, there were bamboo sedan chairs waiting on the road. I was prone to seasickness, so I quickly left the boat and went ashore. We each hired a bamboo sedan chair. The chairs were small but moved very quickly. As we went deeper into the mountains, the road became rugged. My husband would get out of the chair and walk. I dared not get out, gripping the sides tightly, trembling with fear. And the day was overcast with the intention of rain. First, we arrived at the foot of the mountain, where what was said to be "Ten Thousand Tablets Saluting the Sky" was the tomb path of Fan Wenzheng Gong. Strange peaks stood tall, with high wisps of clouds. I did not dare to look directly. A long bridge lay across the water, winding for about a mile, the autumn lotus still green. Crossing the bridge and going up, we reached Lower Baiyun, next to Yunquan Monastery. I took a short rest and drank tea. Afterwards, we went to Lotus Cave. The cave was not very deep and also had a "Thread of Sky," with two cliffs standing face to face, barely allowing one person to pass through. We went up steeply, with faint light revealing in the dark. After climbing several dozen steps, we saw a stone house, which was Middle Baiyun. The sound of pine trees was like the roar of waves, and the surroundings were lonely. We then went to Upper Baiyun, almost losing our way. My legs were exhausted. My husband quickly took me to find a monastery for a brief rest. Together we climbed Jianshan Pavilion. Opposite us was Heyue Terrace, faintly inscribed with the words "Shadow of a Celestial Being." There were strange stones in the monastery; looking down, the clear stream was secluded and lovely, which was Baiyun Spring. We then slowly walked down the mountain from a secluded path behind the house. The sound of the spring whispered in the fallen leaves, and the moss made it difficult to move forward. We visited Hanshan Villa, but it was said to have been in ruins for a long time. Upper Baiyun was outside several layers of clouds. The cold wind was biting, and I deeply felt the lack of warm clothing. We sought out the old site together, boarded the sedan chair, and returned to the boat. On the way home, ten thousand lights were already lit. Although this trip did not exhaust its possibilities, it was still a rewarding trip. My husband said: The sound of Baiyun Spring and the color of Zhongfeng Bamboo are the most beautiful. When the boat reached the city, it was already early evening. We returned to the inn to rest, and the next morning, my husband asked me to write it down.

### Designing for Second Landlords

### Weekly Economical Menu

— Ms. Huaying

The peach blossoms are red, the willows are green, and spring has long arrived in the world. The so-called seasonal spring vegetables have been successively put on the market. This week, let me introduce two dishes for everyone to try. Among the meat dishes, braised bamboo shoots with cured meat is a great choice. Stewing cured meat and fresh meat together is a staple dish for family meals. Adding bamboo shoots and bean curd knots makes it an even more substantial dish, perfect with rice. Among spring fish, knife fish is the most fresh and tender. Whether steamed or braised, it is very delicious. Although it has many fine bones, as long as you are careful, you won't choke. If you don't eat it because of the bones, that would be a pity. The famous knife fish noodles in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou restaurants are also made with knife fish. If you have ever eaten them, you will definitely praise them as incredibly fresh. They have already removed all the large and small bones, and the fish meat is in the soup, so you can't even see it. This also shows how fine and tender it is.

### The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of the Miao People

— Xiafei

The Miao are an uncivilized ethnic group. Their lives and culture are not connected to ours, the Han people. There is no political legislation, and everything is governed by the Tusi system. However, there are more than 70 million Miao people living along the borders of China. In the four provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi alone, there are more than 20 million. Most of them still live a primitive life of eating raw meat and drinking blood, living in caves and in the wild. However, some have already become Sinicized. Although the lives of the Miao people are very poor, there is one good thing, which is that everyone can be self-reliant. There, there is no beggar. In terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, they all supply themselves. From the planting of raw materials to the making of an item or a food, it is all made by themselves.

I remember in April of the year before last (1937), Ms. Gao Yuzhu, a Miao Tusi, and Mr. Yu Jie, a Miao representative, came to Shanghai. At that time, I went to the New Asia Hotel with Mr. Zhang, a reporter from the Central News Agency, to interview them. She was very talkative. When Mr. Zhang asked her about the living conditions of the Miao people, she happily told us about the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the general Miao people there.

In terms of clothing, it is said that the raw materials for the clothes worn by the Miao people are, firstly, grass cotton, which is very rough in quality. They grow it themselves and make their own clothes. The second is hemp cloth. They extract hemp from wild hemp on the mountains or from hemp they grow themselves, and then weave it into hemp cloth. The third is woolen fabric. Because the soil and water in the area are very good and the land is vast and sparsely populated, the standard for distinguishing between rich and poor is the number of cattle and sheep they raise. The wool from the cattle and sheep is sheared off, and they can also weave it into cloth. However, some also make clothes from animal skins. As for the style of clothing, men wear loose-fitting clothes with large sleeves and wide borders. Women wear pleated skirts and do not wear pants. Both men and women are barefoot. They all have a shawl that serves as clothing during the day and as bedding at night.

In terms of food, wheat is the only grain. There is a raw material in the wheat called Qingguo. Its surface is very soft and never rots. It can be used to make dry noodles, which can be eaten all year round to fill the stomach. There are also many yams and radishes in the area, which they use as supplementary grains. As for the main foods, they are still beef and mutton, as well as cow's milk and sheep's milk, etc. They can always make these into delicious foods. Everyone has a food can, plus some noodles. Eating one meal in the morning can last the whole day, and they won't feel hungry until night. In addition, there are many horse meat and eggs, but no seafood.

In terms of housing, the houses of the Miao people are all built with wooden boards, and the structure is very simple. However, some live in caves, and some live in the forest. Because the Miao people rest according to the movement of cattle and sheep, their houses can be moved at any time, and they can be built anytime and anywhere.

In terms of transportation, because the land is vast and sparsely populated, and the people do not live in houses or towns, there is no need for waterways or highways to facilitate transportation. Whether near or far, they all walk. Even when Tusi send messages to each other, they use the post station method. Therefore, transportation is inconvenient, and it is difficult to accept Han and foreign culture. However, the local products are very abundant, and the general people rely on animal husbandry, planting, and hunting for a living.

The Miao people have a matrilineal system, so women's rights are higher than men's rights. However, they are very discriminatory against the Han people, just as the Han people discriminate against the Miao people. Therefore, they have a rule against intermarriage. However, in recent years, the barriers between the two sides have gradually been broken down. Therefore, many Miao people have learned Han Chinese and Han etiquette. They also hope that the Chinese government will enlighten them. At the same time, our country's authorities have also attached great importance to this issue.

### "Celebrating Longevity" and Other Matters

— Maolie

During this time of national crisis, unless one is harboring ulterior motives, there is naturally nothing to celebrate, regardless of whether what is being celebrated is longevity or not. However, while this statement is true for most people, it cannot be said that we should not celebrate Mr. Ma Xiangbo's centennial birthday.

Mr. Ma's centennial birthday is, of course, already very rare, worthy of being called a "human treasure" and should be celebrated. However, I believe that what is especially rare is his morality, knowledge, love of country, and love of the nation, always standing at the forefront of the times, never letting his younger generations bear the responsibility alone. Therefore, when we reach his one-hundredth birthday, we should celebrate it greatly. Moreover, our celebration is not merely trying to find joy in hardship. It also has a positive significance: to inspire us younger generations with his spirit of growing stronger with age, and to transfer the birthday gift money to refugee donations. I believe that anyone who respects Mr. Ma will certainly be willing to join this celebration!

Because of celebrating longevity, I thought of congratulating on joyful events and offering condolences at funerals. I still hold this view: during this time of national crisis, any joy does not need to be congratulated, and any funeral does not need to be condoled—unless this joy or funeral has a positive meaning for the country and the nation, like Mr. Ma's longevity. However, what we have recently seen and heard are quite a few extravagant and ostentatious joyful events and funerals, flaunted in newspapers and making a great uproar in society, which truly makes me feel somewhat bewildered! Of course, they have money, and they are using their own money to have such a lively time, which is none of anyone else's business, let alone mine. We can completely ignore it and leave it unaddressed. However, at this juncture when the entire country is united in resisting the war, who can say for sure that certain private actions, such as such large-scale congratulations or condolences, will not affect public sentiment, international opinion, and prevent it from having adverse consequences? Of course, I believe that they do not have ulterior motives; however, isn't this ultimately not an unavoidable thing, and couldn't it be saved? Why bother to go to such lengths?

Everyone knows that at present, we must exhaust our energy, resources, and any strength, and use it for the purpose of resisting the war and building the country. Other needs that can be saved should be saved, and if they cannot be completely saved, they should be saved to the smallest and most insignificant extent. Only when the final victory is realized can we settle down and celebrate, congratulate, and condole personally!

Therefore, I advise everyone: we should smile, and wait until the final victory; we should cry, and also wait until the final victory! During this war of resistance, we can only grit our teeth, calm our minds, not move our emotions, and strive forward!

### Moonlit Night to Xuzhou

— Li Qiao

——Memoirs of the Xuzhou Breakout

Tong Village is a fairly large village of about forty to fifty households. The spacious tile houses are more numerous than the sorghum stalk thatched houses, which is a rare phenomenon in the north. It is about thirty miles away from Xuzhou, but for some reason, all the people have fled, and every room is so empty, with furniture thrown around randomly. Thin dogs that have lost their masters and have been hungry for who knows how many days cower timidly in the corners, daring not to jump up and bark when they see strangers.

In Lunan, the female comrades of several wartime service groups who had been sent back returned to the team because the Longhai Railway was cut off. It was said that Xuzhou was very dangerous and there were no civilians left. But everyone still hoped to get to Xuzhou soon, to defend that important military town and prevent the enemy from opening the Tianjin-Pukou Railway!

Enemy planes circled in the sky all day long, so the men and horses stayed inside the houses, letting them waste more gasoline, ignoring them.

At 7:00 in the evening, holding a mortar shell, we set off again in the darkness along the highway. Yellow dust flew everywhere, covering people in yellow dust, clogging their nostrils with clumps of dirt, causing them to cough incessantly. ...

A small village divided in half by the highway was completely destroyed by enemy planes. The thatched houses were burned down by incendiary bombs, leaving only two baked red earth walls standing amidst the rubble, and people were buried under the rubble, emitting a foul odor.

As if seeing ghosts, smelling that unpleasant stench, people couldn't help but run forward.

The moon slowly climbed up from the dim wilderness. Trees and villages were revealed from the darkness. The clear moonlight poured down palely on the sleeping wheat, which lay still, enjoying the warmth of the moonlight.

Because they were waiting for the distribution of gray flour, the brothers stopped in a long line on the highway, preparing to receive the flour at Xidian, before the team slowly continued forward.

Because we couldn't wait for the flour, we carried the mortar shells and left without the flour. In the bright moonlight, on the thick, dusty highway, we walked for more than two hours, passing several protruding small mountains, and arrived in Xuzhou.

This was no longer the Xuzhou we had passed through a month ago. At that time, Xuzhou was hot, bustling, but now Xuzhou was dead. The houses on both sides of the street seemed to have caught some infectious disease, everything was flattened, tiles pressed on charred beams, walls without roofs stood upright, as if complaining about the enemy's brutality. There was not a single person on the street, and the harsh footsteps did not elicit howls from the dogs of the bereaved. The whole scene was desolate and terrifying, like walking into a dead city.

Suddenly, a truck full of gray flour came from the front. We hurriedly stopped it and asked for ten bags of cement flour. But everyone saw that there was no way to carry it away, so we piled the flour and mortar shells on a broken horse-drawn cart beside the road, and seven or eight people pulled and pushed it. After a lot of effort, we pushed it to the outside of the South Gate, but could no longer move it. We had no choice but to hide the ten bags of flour in a small thatched house beside the road, and carrying the mortar shells, we hurried to catch up with the team in the midst of a burst of gunfire.

Da da da ... the clear sound of the machine gun rang out, and the sound of cannons rumbled and chewed, the air was so tense that it was about to explode, and the men and horses were only moving forward quickly. ...

Sweating, laboriously carrying the heavy mortar shell, I followed behind the team. Although I was a little surprised that the enemy had already reached the outskirts of Xuzhou, I did not expect that this was the last night of Xuzhou, and that the next day (May 19) the enemy would enter Xuzhou.

We walked silently. When the hazy dawn broke, an enemy plane flew in from behind, and the team quickly scattered into the wheat field and disappeared. The enemy plane flew away, and the men and horses reassembled into an iron stream, surging forward.

### A Brief Account of the Restoration

— Qianshan

Standing alone on a peak hundreds of feet above sea level, I leaned silently against the vermilion pillar of the martyrs' shrine. Across the river, a verdant islet drifted. In the blue haze, under the azure sky, not a sail, not a bird, as if in withered meditation, like an empty pool, like a water moon, like a world forgotten. Having trudged from the other side of the river, prepared with the mindset of entering a tiger's den, I now stood again by this shrine, on this river, on this peak hundreds of feet above sea level, at the foot of the mountain, on the riverbank, in the wilderness of desolate villages, I gazed intently as the light returned to the human world, I watched, I waved my hand.

That azure blue, that pure white, that bright red, passion made my heart boil, brilliance made my eyes dazzled.

The sound of trumpets rang out. The victory anthem, the loud song of righteousness.

As if throwing a stone into an ancient well, silence and death transformed into ripples. The air stirred, the river quaked. The peaceful heart, a ship sailing on calm waters, suddenly disappeared into haze, buried in black waves towering to the sky, approaching death, gathered and kneaded by the hands of a terrifying demon, only to have the clouds part, the rain stop, the water recede, and see anew the bright shore. Thank you for giving me a good opportunity to cross the river to C City. Just as I arrived, the flags had changed color. In the vast night, I saw a glimmer of dawn again.

On this riverside fortress once occupied by jackals and wolves, the enemy army left some traces. These were the shameful traces of the defeated! I joyfully gathered them up!

Beside the leaning pagoda, I picked up a small bronze Buddha statue, an exquisite and finely carved little ornament. Beside a ruined cannon, I picked up a bundle of scarlet letters, a love letter from a lover to her beloved. And in the grass pile on the back hill, on the edge of the cliff, I saw many scattered corpses of enemy soldiers.

As I descended the mountain, there was a large square at the foot of the mountain, crowded with a vast throng of people. Among them were soldiers in grass-green uniforms, as well as farmers with passionate emotions. Everyone stood in a large circle, heads raised, with solemn but also joyful expressions. After a while, the sound of a bugle rang out, the signal for lowering the flag.

"You haven't heard our voices in a long time, have you?"

Hearing the officer's words, the people nodded, and some even shed tears. They were so excited that they could not utter a word. They only used their clumsy lips to lick the salty tears hanging from the corners of their mouths.

After the flag lowering ceremony was over, I followed the crowd to listen to the officer's speech, which lasted a full hour, and no one felt tired.

"From today on, we will be stationed here. As long as the last of our brothers remains, we vow to defend this land!"

Who could forget these words? They were so weighty and profound, making people grateful and making them weep.

But I could not forget the people's response even more:

"You are too bitter! Your pay is so little! You are defending our land for us. We think we should give you some help."

### The City is Green with Grass

### Wearing a Façade

— Chen Zuoer

The biggest patrons of Western-bound books are young students, and what young students carry in and out are Western-bound books. Carrying many thick books seems to show broad and deep knowledge, and that one is high and noble.

Those who can carry such books are indeed extraordinary. To be able to carry them in and out with an upright posture is especially good. However, those who can thoroughly understand the meaning of the books are even more precious.

I once saw a group of three or five young people carrying Western-bound books on a public bus. They spoke with a foreign accent and were unusually lively, but they couldn't answer an English question from a foreigner, leaving them speechless and at a loss. Later, they finally got off quietly amidst the laughter of others.

This kind of "quietness" makes me sigh for those who carry Western-bound books. Of course, I cannot deny that there are some who carry Western-bound books who are calm and collected, and carry them without being strange. What I think is a pity are those "upright" ones who are just showing off an empty façade. In this extraordinary period, it is good to have time to devote oneself to learning. The foundation of a new China can only be built by people who have knowledge and skills. But wearing a facade by carrying books is not as good as really flipping through them, so you can be ashamed and the state will at least save some trouble in arranging jobs in the future.

### Laughter

— Liu You

I remember a person in distress who, when sorrowful, smiled at me. This was a "bitter smile," which made me sympathize with him, and a thick sorrow floated into my heart.

I remember a treacherous person who, when being cunning, smiled at me. This was a "cold smile," which made me resent him, revealing an unhappy grimace.

I remember a cruel person who, when acting tyrannically, smiled at me. This was a "sinister smile," which made me abhor him, and ignited my anger!

Bitter smiles, cold smiles, sinister smiles, constantly circulate on people's faces, imprinted on the bottom of my heart.

Also, I have seen a type of smile that is not genuine. It is like a drop of water on the face, leaving no trace after it dries.

I know that the purest, most precious smile flies out from the bottom of the heart, possessing a brilliant radiance and carrying a beautiful rose color that will never fade.

This smile, I have never seen!

Is it the charming smile of a beautiful woman? No, there are too many of this kind of smile. It seems one is unwilling to see it anymore. That forced smile and alluring gaze have become tiresome!

This is a hard-to-find smile, but anyone can smile like this.

On the battlefield, for justice, for humanity, the heroic warriors fight against the devils who kill and suck blood. After they fulfill their great aspirations and great tasks, shedding their last drop of blood and falling on the battlefield, in the last moment before their death, that smile that leaps out from the heart, its brilliant radiance containing a rose color, representing the hardship of his life's struggle, becomes this beautiful and magnificent smile.

This is the most precious smile in the world! This is the most triumphant smile!

### Reading "The Pale Face of a Scholar"

— Yun Zhan

"A scholar is useless in all respects," was originally a scholar's self-deprecation. Although they "have no power to bind a chicken," they would never forget the exaggerated function of "a brush sweeping through thousands of troops." Therefore, even knowing they are useless, they are still unwilling to abandon the so-called "scholar's true colors," because beyond "a life of writing," there is also a social existence; for example, the four characters "knowledgeable literary person," generally speaking, should be so glorious and impressive! Thus, "before knowing how to write an article, first pretend to have a pale face." What Mr. Yanqi considers a great shame, many people are hating that they cannot learn to imitate!

Investigating further, one cannot help but blame society. I remember a literary writer who went to a venue to negotiate something. Because he was wearing short clothes and because he inquired about things in detail, he not only suffered the other party's contemptuous looks but was also rebuffed to his face: "Hmph! Negotiating with someone who hasn't drunk ink is always muddled." This literary writer later told me with emotion: "I never thought that after spending half my life mixing in three kinds of ink—red, blue, and black—it's not as good as a long robe."

Here we can understand that "scholars" may as well "have only an empty reputation," but their faces cannot be pale. Besides a suit and leather shoes, don't forget to hang a fountain pen.

Thank you to General Bai Chongxi for proving that the pen and the gun have the same power. The title of "cultural person" on the street seems more transparent and fresh than "scholar." Thus, in the future, when the War of Resistance is won and lost territories are recovered, pens and guns will shine together under the clear sky and white sun. Who says scholars are useless? They should be killed without exception!

Scholars were like that before the war, and scholars during and after the war are like this. It is truly unbearable yet bearable to be a scholar; sitting in a pavilion, shaking a pen in the belly of the question, his achievements can be equated with the martyrs who fought bloody battles against Japan. There is nothing more advantageous in the world than this, so why wouldn't a scholar be happy to do it? No wonder people rush to imitate, fearing only that their faces will not be pale enough.

Mr. Yanqi teaches "scholars" to abandon their "pale faces," of course, with good reason. Unfortunately, in reality, those who are willing to abandon their "pale faces" have already abandoned their pens to join the army, throwing themselves forward regardless of their own safety. Those who remain rely on their "pale faces" to earn a living in society, avoiding the contemptuous looks of others and having the knowledge of not having drunk ink. The sales of vanishing cream are booming, mostly applied to the faces of playboys in foreign concessions!

Moreover, since pens and guns have the same power, when it comes to awarding merits in the future, perhaps the paler the face, the greater the功劳?

Therefore, I think Mr. Yanqi's theory is in vain.

### Common Mistakes in Peking Opera

— Faisheng

Mistakes in Peking Opera are often unnoticed, and even the performers are unaware of them. Because these are professional employees, and artists at low pay levels, although they may have the intention to correct the script, their words are insignificant, and they may even get a cold shoulder from the main actors!

Common mistakes in Peking Opera are not impossible to correct, but the reason why they cannot be corrected, in addition to the one mentioned above, is also because some actors who enjoy great fame are unwilling to improve them. Here, I must explain further that it is not that the main actors are unwilling to improve, but some actors, although they enjoy great fame, lack knowledge and only know how to imitate their master or school (i.e., conservatives), so they dare not change even the mistakes of their school or master. In addition, some artists who claim to be responsible for improving Peking Opera, as long as they can improve a few plays by slightly improving the unreasonable parts, and receive good reviews from many audiences, become complacent and are no longer willing to continue their artistic efforts. This is because they have already received a considerable reward. If things continue like this, how can the common mistakes in Peking Opera be fully corrected?

But then again, are the mistakes in Peking Opera due to misinterpretation or were they wrong from the beginning by the inventors? This needs to be discussed separately. Because the mistakes invented by the predecessors were not there from the beginning, and misinterpretations are even more common. For example, the name of the play *Black Dragon Residence* can be said to have been wrong from the very beginning. Because what the play portrays is not "Song Jiang visiting a brothel" but Song Jiang's small house where he lived with Yan Xijiao. The word "residence/院" is already inappropriate, so some people changed it to *Song Jiang Returns*. Furthermore, when Song Jiang enters the stage, the lyrics he sings begin with "The old master has finished beating the drums and retreated." Imagine, as the old master, why would he need to beat the drums himself to retreat? This is one point. Also, in the following dialogue of "sweeping the floor and hanging the painting," the floor must be swept every day, but does the painting also need to be hung every day? Therefore, although these mistakes have been passed down from the inventors to the present, it is also conceivable that conservative artists dare not change them.

Secondly, there are countless instances of misinterpretations. For example, in *Black Dragon Residence*, when Yan Xijiao sees Song Jiang enter and look around, she is supposed to close the door immediately. Because the two are arguing at home, it is reasonable to think that they should close the door. As the saying goes, "family scandals should not be made public." Even if she doesn't close the door immediately after entering, she must take the time to close it during the argument. Moreover, when Yan Xijiao later pushes Song Jiang out the door, I have seen actresses playing this role, and it can be said that ten out of ten pretend to unlock and open the door. Then, is this door a "spring lock"? If it wasn't closed before, why does it need to be opened now? This, I believe, is a misinterpretation. Presumably, the inventor had a closing-the-door action when entering, but later forgot about it, resulting in this mistake. However, the audience often doesn't pay attention to this point, because it's just a small action!

Another example is when Miheng scolds Cao, in the second scene, when he enters the stage and sings the *liushui* aria "In front of the Prime Minister's mansion, the spirit is high, densely layered spears and knives are arrayed, painted pavilions and carved beams surround twin phoenixes, appearing like the Emperor's nine dragons in court." Generally, performers sing all four lines in one breath and then pretend to raise their feet and enter the door, which is a big mistake. Because the first two lines refer to the front of the Prime Minister's mansion, and the last two lines refer to inside the Prime Minister's mansion. If he hasn't entered the mansion, how can he know the scenery inside the Prime Minister's mansion in advance? If Kong Rong was used to coming here, that would be another story, but this Mr. Miheng is ascending the Dragon Gate for the first time. Without entering the mansion gate, he certainly wouldn't know the inside situation of the Prime Minister's mansion. Therefore, this mistake must be a misinterpretation, due to later artists' unwillingness to empathize with the plot and falling into error. In addition to these two reasons, there are also those made to respond to the scene. For example, in the play *Pinggui Returns to the Kiln*, when Xue Pinggui finishes singing "One horse leaves the Western Liang border" and enters the stage, the scene usually plays the *changshe* (a name for the gong and drum rhythm). But when Xue walks to a certain position, in order to call up the *dutou* (another name for the gong and drum rhythm), he makes a whipping motion with the whip in his right hand, while using his left hand to pretend to hold the reins. When the qin music plays to the point where he should open his mouth, he opens his mouth and sings "The unfeeling man's tears fall on his chest..." Think about it, after whipping the horse, the horse's walking speed will definitely be faster. How can he still act like he is stopping the horse and controlling the saddle? Although this action error is an error left behind by the predecessors to respond to the scene, it is also possible to correct it. The late famous martial artist Wang Huchen was a member who worked hard to improve it. Now, only Zhou Xinfang can improve it. However, this action should not only be improved in the play *Wujia Slope*. All plays that use *changshe* to enter the stage, regardless of *sheng*, *dan*, *jing*, *chou*, *mo*, as well as civil and military plays, must be improved like Zhou Xinfang.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (138)

— Xu Muyun

Thirteenth Sister Honors Her Parents, Nian Gengyao Respects His Teacher

Mr. Li was also an upright person who disliked catering to powerful dignitaries. When he was the chief examiner, a prince gave him two names, asking him to considerately admit them. Who knew that the old gentleman didn't take this to heart, and when the list was released, he didn't include the names of those two people. The prince was furious and impeached him, saying he had accepted bribes, and sentenced him to exile. Fortunately, General Nian was in power at that time and, seeing his teacher in trouble, requested that he be exiled to "Huangmao Ridge." Unexpectedly, upon careful investigation, "Huangmao Ridge" was next to Yunlong Mountain in the south of Xuzhou City. Li Pan's exile would actually be to his hometown. This is also a rare wonder in history. At first hearing, everyone thought "Huangmao Ridge" must be an extremely remote place, but in fact, the scenery is very beautiful, leaning against the mountain (Yunlong Mountain) and overlooking the lake (Shigou Lake), less than a mile from the city. To this day, the stone wall at the foot of Yunlong Mountain still has the three large characters of Huangmao Ridge, which are five or six zhang long, and the people of Xuzhou praise it as a good story.

One year, on the anniversary of the top scholar Li's success, local civil and military officials all went to congratulate him. However, Xuzhou is not like the provincial capital, so the official position of the garrison commander is considered top-notch, but it is still much smaller compared to the top scholar who had been the chief examiner. Therefore, the middle gate of the scholar's mansion does not need to be opened. Unexpectedly, around noon, a person suddenly arrived, dressed in green with a small hat, only accompanied by one attendant. After the two dismounted, the attendant rushed inside and kowtowed to the scholar, presenting the visiting card. The scholar was greatly surprised and quickly ordered the middle gate to be opened to welcome him. The man in green came to the hall, respectfully performed the three kneelings and nine kowtows ceremony, and left after only sitting for a moment. All the guests in Li's mansion were puzzled. Later, Li's servants spread the news, revealing that the guest in green, whom they opened the middle gate to welcome, was General Nian, who commanded hundreds of thousands of troops. Although Nian was cruel and killed He Yufeng's father, causing a deep feud between them, one was able to honor her parents, and the other was able to respect his teacher. When we, later generations, see this, we must call them heroines and heroes.

Zhou Manhua was initially a member of the dance world, and later joined the Star Film Company as a contract actress for a long time. After the war broke out, she joined the "Shanghai Filmmakers Troupe" and went on a long expedition to Sichuan, wandering for over a year. Recently, she returned to Shanghai from Yunnan with Wang Xianzai and his wife. The Star Film Company now has a strong need for talent and has signed a long-term contract with her.

Chen Yunshang, accompanied by her loving mother, left Shanghai on the Russian Empress ship this morning to return to Hong Kong. Many senior officials of Xinhua gathered at the dock to "see her off respectfully." It is said that she will not be able to return to the sea for three months.

The "American-Chinese Film Joint Corporation," which governs the three major companies, Xinhua, Huacheng, and Huaxin, recently established its head office at Room 42, 4th Floor, 9 The Bund, French Concession. The internal arrangement is all set. Zhang Shankun, the general manager of the "Joint Corporation" in China, as well as Li Dashen, Bian Yuying, Wu Bangfan, and other business directors of the three companies, have started working at the new location since yesterday.

Wang Hanlun, who has been out of the limelight for many years, once established the Hanlun Beauty Salon on Xiafei Road, operating a beauty business similar to a barbershop. Later, she married and retired, and the business ceased. Subsequently, she and her husband Wang Jihuan (a famous scholar from eastern Zhejiang) had a falling out in Hangzhou, which led to litigation and eventually separation. Not long after, Wang Jihuan suffered a disaster when his house collapsed and died tragically. Since returning to Shanghai, Wang Hanlun has also had little development. Recently, she has made plans and is ready to move after a long period of dormancy, preparing to raise 5,000 gold coins to restore the old business of the beauty salon. It is said that under active implementation, she has already found some clues and will soon start running it.

Zhang Shankun's father's birthday celebration is scheduled to be held at the New Asia Hotel on the 13th of this month. At that time, all the famous actors in Shanghai, such as Zhang Eyun, Gai Jiaotian, Qilin Tong, Huang Guiqiu, etc., as well as all the senior officials of the Gongwu Stage, and all the male and female stars under the "Joint Corporation" will participate in the salon performance. It is said to be a gathering of famous actors with many programs, which will be divided into several groups and performed simultaneously. This move in the film and theater circles is tantamount to a group performance, and it is expected that the wonderful presentations will be extraordinary.

### After Watching the Public Performance of "This is Just Spring"

— Li Ren

This is an old script, but it is being performed for the first time in the country. Its background is Peiping in the warlord era. It depicts the corruption of bureaucrats and the contradictions and conflicts between revolution and love.

The whole play is divided into three acts, with only one set. First, Feng Yunping, the lover of the hall director's wife ten years ago, arrives. He is now a revolutionary youth, and since he has come to the north to be active, he makes a detour to visit his lover. The hall director's wife gains the vitality of this new life in the depressing reality and is about to rekindle their love and enjoy the happiness of youth, but the great wave of revolution comes to break their love threads. She is like a flower in a greenhouse, yearning for new air and hoping for the warmth of nature, but before the season matures, she has already withered. — This is how the play develops.

The playwright and director both play actors, which adds a lot of color to the whole play. Although it is a faint description, it gives the audience a more intimate feeling. Li Jianwu's play deserves the audience's warm applause. He thoroughly and profoundly exposed a greedy, stingy, and corrupt old bureaucrat. Every action has no waste or excess. The loudness of the voice and the accuracy of the pronunciation are secondary. As for Xia Xia's role as the hall director's wife, she has the most scenes and always holds the audience's attention. Her dialogue is smooth, and her attitude is natural. In front of different roles, she particularly shows the different psychological reactions. For example, when she introduced Director Bai to Feng Yunping, she said, "This is the famous Director Bai, and I don't know how many people have died in his hands every year!" Then there is a sweet smile, which truly shows her strength and her coquettishness in front of her lover. She laughs, she cries, she complains, and she is angry, all just right. In this play, she is successful!

Bai Zhenshan's performance is brisk, appropriate, and humorous, but his pronunciation is not very clear. Feng Yunping's movements are a little too reserved and mechanical. He seems to lack wit and liveliness. He should bow a little deeper when bowing to the hall director to show the guest's position. Although the movements of the female principal played by Bai Li are very natural, she speaks her lines too fast, too softly, and not often facing the audience, which are her shortcomings.

Regarding the effects, it is even more worthwhile to mention the tiny bird sounds, which make the audience seem to feel the bright spring light flashing before their eyes, but it does not reduce the audience's attention to the stage, which is a great achievement. The color arrangement is also quite successful.

Finally, the bowing of all the actors to thank the audience makes the audience and the actors' emotions get a sincere exchange.

The result of the second experimental performance of the Shanghai Drama and Art Society is successful! Although "This is Just Spring," the shadow of spring has crossed into the theater circle of the "isolated island" and into people's hearts.

### Rare News in the Entertainment World

Gu Wuwei secretly came to Shanghai from Hong Kong and is staying at Shangxianfang on Xiafei Road. Rumors that he is staying at the New Oriental Hotel are incorrect. According to Gu, his mission is to wish Zhang Shankun's father a happy birthday. However, reporters have learned that it is actually because it is not easy to gain a foothold in Hong Kong, and he wants to find a base in Shanghai, and he is interested in the New Asia Stage. After arriving here, Gu's whereabouts are mysterious, and he does not easily meet with outsiders.

After the New Asia Stage stopped performing, the Dayun, Yixin, and Wufu companies had negotiations. According to a big shot from the Dayun company yesterday, this matter is not difficult to turn hostility into friendship because most of the parties involved are old friends. Later, the Dayun company disbanded, and Xu Peigen took over the New Asia Stage, performing Cantonese opera. The Cantonese opera troupe will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong today.

Kun Dan Jiang Yunxia returned to Shanghai from Ningbo. She met with reporters on the balcony of the Carlton Grand Theatre the night before last. According to her, she will go to other places to perform with Yang Baotong and others and does not plan to join a troupe in Shanghai.
