However, the Chinese army did not continue to attack into the city due to lack of reinforcements. The Japanese side in Guangzhou admitted that the Chinese guerrilla attack was completely unexpected, resulting in significant losses for the Japanese, because the rainy season had begun in Guangdong Province, and the Japanese did not expect the Chinese army to take advantage of the heavy rain to launch an attack.

### Soviet Press Praises Chinese Army's Spirit

(Hong Kong) Moscow Dispatch: Soviet newspapers have been paying close attention to the Sino-Japanese war situation recently. Authoritative sources in Moscow have stated that the retreat from Nanchang has no significant impact on China's military. The heroic fighting of Chinese soldiers near Nanchang reaffirms the Chinese nation's will and its government's determination to resist foreign aggression. Since the occupation of Guangzhou and the retreat from Hankou, the Japanese have been at a standstill. If the Japanese army advances further, it will encounter even stronger resistance from the Chinese army. The Japanese warlords' objective in attacking Nanchang was to boost domestic morale, attempting to use a new military "victory" to quell domestic dissatisfaction with the warlords. The price the Japanese paid for this "victory" was the 30,000 soldiers killed and wounded near Nanchang. (5th Dispatch)

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation: March 30 to April 5

(Chongqing) The spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission stated that the war situation this week (March 30 to April 5) was more active than last week. In the battle in northern Jiangxi last week, although our army in Nanchang made a strategic shift, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, and their elite forces were completely wiped out. Their conspiracy to make a last desperate gamble was completely shattered by us. Although the enemy troops on various fronts deliberately appeared rampant, they were met with a head-on blow by our loyal and brave soldiers, launching a large-scale attack, causing them to flee in panic and sink further into the quagmire. The general summary of the process is detailed as follows:

Guangdong Front: There were no changes on the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangzhou-Sanshui lines. Over 2,000 enemy troops and over 20 tanks advancing from Jiujiang, supported by aircraft and poison gas, were personally commanded by the enemy commander Zhizhisong Di, launching a fierce offensive. This week, they repeatedly engaged our army in fierce battles in Huangmaikeng, Zhuangyuan Mountain, and other places. At the same time, enemy troops landed from Beijie, converging on Jiangmen in a two-pronged attack, attempting to realize their delusion of breaking through Zhongshan. On March 31, Shaping, Beijie, and Jiangmen were once lost. Subsequently, our army displayed its spirit, launching a large-scale counter-offensive, completely defeating the enemy, killing over 1,500. Enemy commander Zhizhisong and commander Zhimu were also killed. The remnants retreated to Jiujiang. There are still several hundred remaining enemy troops, and they are being swept away continuously, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them all. On the southern route, enemy warships on the Fangcheng sea, under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, landed in Qisha on March 31. After being bombarded by our teams, the enemy abandoned over two hundred bodies and fled back to the ships. The sea is currently calm. On the same day, several hundred enemy troops from Ding'an on Hainan Island, accompanied by several tanks, advanced towards Chidi via Leimingshi, encountering strong resistance from our army. After five hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was unable to withstand the pressure and retreated to Ding'an.

Northern Jiangxi Front: Our army abandoned Nanchang and Wuning this week to engage in an encirclement of the enemy. After suffering losses, the enemy's fierce offensive was thwarted. From the 1st, our army launched a full-scale counter-offensive. The enemy in the Nanchang area was consistently blocked by us north of Liantang and made no progress. In the Gao'an area, our enemy armies engaged in fierce battles at Zhanggunao, Xiangfuguan Mountain, and other places. Under our fierce artillery fire, the enemy abandoned over a thousand bodies. After achieving our goal of attrition, we have moved to advantageous areas, and the enemy will never succeed. As for our army's counter-attack on Wuning, at noon on the 2nd, it launched a brave attack on the enemy on Hushan Changlun Shang with the force of a bamboo splitting, but the enemy resisted stubbornly, resulting in a long and fierce battle. The enemy's line collapsed and retreated towards Wuning, and our army took advantage of the victory to attack, killing countless enemies. On the morning of the 3rd, the main part of the enemy army came to aid, and after we defeated them one by one, we continued to track and advance all day on the 4th, forcing an attack on the southern outskirts of Wuning. The enemy inside the city was in a state of panic (to be continued).

### Military Service Administration Announces Awards and Punishments for Personnel

### Editorial: The Wang Jingwei Secret Treaty Theory

Wang Jingwei's flight from his post to seek peace occurred at the end of last year, nearly ten months ago, and this newspaper has repeatedly discussed it. We believe that abandoning one's post and leaving the country is one mistake, in action. Advocating a policy that clearly contradicts the national policy and rashly proclaiming it both domestically and abroad is a second mistake, in failing to recognize the importance of the overall situation. Ignoring Japan's long-term plans to destroy China and falling into their trap, naively believing in equal and mutually beneficial peace, is a third mistake, in lacking sufficient understanding. Thinking too lightly of oneself, believing that everyone can speak their own mind; thinking too highly of oneself, believing that one can rally all parties; taking preconceived notions and biased views as true and insightful knowledge, and treating national and global affairs as one's own family affairs to be manipulated at will; a fourth mistake, in forgetting one's roots. In summary, the main points are as follows. Some denounce him as a traitor collaborating with the enemy, willingly serving as a puppet, deeply hating and abhorring him, and severely condemning him. We, however, believe that Wang Jingwei was blinded by greed, leading to his absurdity. Regardless of how his intentions and actions may seem, the possible objective result will be no different from betraying the country and collaborating with the enemy, and condemnation is certainly appropriate. However, judging his true intentions, it is probably not the case. Calmly and rationally, weighing the situation and discussing the matter, we should not exaggerate too much. Who knew that his errors would not stop there.

Yesterday, a dispatch from Chongqing stated that Wang Jingwei had actually signed a secret treaty with Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, listing specific details that were beyond imagination, with the loss of his conscience beyond the pale, defying all ordinary emotions and reasons. It went far beyond human nature, which is why it was beyond our expectations. He not only acquiesced to the current situation and surrendered, but also offered further advice on military matters: Taking advantage of the fact that the reorganization of the Chinese central government's army had not yet been completed, he urged Japan to launch a fierce offensive, targeting Xi'an, Nanning, Changsha, Xiangyang, and Fancheng. His intention was that only in this way could he protect his envisioned small court, and only in this way could he place the National Government in a desperate situation. In his self-serving plans, he aimed to raise twenty divisions of henchmen, to fulfill his dream of being a capable scholar, accomplished in both literary and martial arts; to claim the title of "Director-General," to fulfill his long-cherished dream of becoming a leader; to demand three million yuan per month, taking two hundred million yuan outright, to fulfill his dream of wealth and security; to abolish the puppet organizations in Beiping and Nanjing, to carry out his dream of monopolizing the betrayal of the country; to curry favor with Germany and Italy, and yet not dare to offend Britain and the United States, there must be another dream of relying on foreign aid to permanently secure his position. Alas, what Wang Jingwei once repeatedly proclaimed to the world, taking mutual destruction and mutual prosperity as the basis of his argument; taking the future of China and the future of East Asia as the subject of his theory, his arguments were shallow, but perhaps could deceive the naive, and his subject was ambiguous, but perhaps could be considered grand. Now, if we examine the contents of the secret treaty, we can see that the prosperity he spoke of was the prosperity of Wang Jingwei and Japan, and the future he spoke of was the future of Wang Jingwei and Japan. Is there anything else? Is there anything else?

The so-called "China experts" in Japan possess an unsurpassed dedication and industriousness, yet they are like carving a mark on a moving boat to find a lost sword, unaware that times have changed. Therefore, they completely fail to understand the Republic of China under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. This time, they rashly launched a military invasion, resulting in being burned and exhausted, running out of strength and unable to continue. This is a fundamental error that is regrettable but inexcusable. As for colluding with the foolish Wang Jingwei and signing a useless secret treaty, if this is not a continuation of their traditional error as "China experts," then it is a clear recognition that it is akin to drawing a cake to satisfy hunger, using it only to soothe their longing when they are extremely hungry and thirsty. And while millions or even two hundred million yuan is a huge sum, under China's long-term war of resistance, Japan is facing indefinite victory and endless consumption, with military expenses calculated in the millions. Compared to these two, the amount bribed in the secret treaty to feed Wang Jingwei is not even worth considering as an extremely large sum. Moreover, given China's vastness and wealth, investing millions or even two hundred million yuan, even though the effectiveness is uncertain, compared to the two, it is still a "low-risk, high-return" gamble. Is this not what Hiranuma thought?

But is the secret treaty truly authentic? This newspaper based its information on Reuters, which based its information on Chongqing newspapers. As of the time of writing, there has been no denial from the relevant authorities, so there is little room for doubt. Today, China is facing a great crisis unprecedented in the world, and those who govern the country must base their responses on the political principles that China has historically used to deal with chaotic times. The way to deal with someone like Wang Jingwei should be based on the future of the nation and people, and without hesitation or favoritism, the strictest sanctions should be imposed. He roams freely abroad, truly beyond the reach of national law, but for three months, rumors have been circulating frequently, and the authorities have still been lenient towards Wang Jingwei. Whether it's the way to govern in times of chaos, at most it is debatable, and will not be discussed here. Even from the perspective of deterring others through punishment, he is already on the list of those who cannot be treated with leniency. If we talk about preventing problems before they arise, then the problem has arisen gradually, and seeing the small, we know the big. Considering Wang Jingwei's character, his position, and his history, and yet he has gone so far as to flee and advocate for peace, then his character inherently has the potential to do anything. This can be foreseen. If we continue to be lenient, then he will act wantonly and even sign a treaty to betray the country.

### Over the Past Year, Heavy Japanese Casualties in the Jin-Cha-Sui Border Region, Nineteen Officers of the Rank of Major or Above Killed in Action, Casualty Rate Increasing Daily, Difficult to Sustain

Xingji: A responsible agency in the 口(mouth - presumably referring to a person/organization) war zone recently released statistics on various aspects since the beginning of the war. There have been eight positional battles in northern Chahar and northern Shanxi around Datong, Tianzhen, Pingxingguan, Tiejiaoling, Xinkou (including the plains), Niangziguan, Taiyuan, and Hanhouling, with a Chinese-Japanese casualty ratio of 23.5 to 1. There have been thirty-nine sieges, with twenty-four successful and fifteen unsuccessful, and five counter-attacks (in the triangle area of Hanhouling and Shanxi). There have been thirty-two sieges, with a Chinese-Japanese casualty ratio of 1.4 to 1. The larger battles fought against Japanese troops on the move from March 1938 to February of this year numbered twelve, and the smaller battles numbered over 2,900, with a Chinese-Japanese casualty ratio of 3 to 5. There have been 971 mobile battles involving units of regimental size or larger from March 1938 to March 18 of this year, and 2,302 involving smaller units. There have been 132 larger night attacks, with ninety-four successful and thirty-eight unsuccessful, with a Chinese-Japanese casualty ratio of 1 to 4. Nineteen Japanese officers of the rank of major or above have been killed in action, including Major General Miura Toshiji, commander of the 21st Brigade of the 5th Division; Major General Shimo Yoshihisa, commander of the 40th Brigade of the 20th Division at "Xinkou"; Brigadier General Choei, name and title unknown; Colonel Sato, commander of the Engineer Regiment at "Zhongtiaoshan"; Colonel Shinjyo Jun, commander of the 3rd Transport Regiment of the 2nd Division at "Guoxian"; Colonel Ebina Hiroshi, commander of the 123rd Regiment of the 108th Division at "Xinri"; Colonel Ishida Kanetoshi, commander of the 119th Regiment of the 109th Division at "Lingshi"; a colonel in the Field Artillery, regiment commander, name unknown; Lieutenant Colonel Takeshima Kyoichi, battalion commander of the 20th Division at Jiwang Mountain; Lieutenant Colonel Oka Takafuminosuke, battalion commander of the 105th Regiment of the 108th Division at "Pingding"; Lieutenant Colonel Naritomi Eiju, battalion commander of the 119th Regiment of the 109th Division at "Gaoping"; Lieutenant Colonel Nomura Mamoru, battalion commander of the 10th Field Artillery Regiment; Lieutenant Colonel Konbayashi Kichiro, battalion commander of the 108th Field Artillery Regiment at "Xinkou"; Major Morimoto Hiroshi, battalion commander of the 18th Cavalry Regiment at "Niangziguan"; Major Fujii Kunitaro, battalion commander of the 119th Regiment of the 109th Division at "Lucheng"; Major Harada Ai, battalion commander of the 78th Regiment of the 20th Division; Major Yamada Tatsutsune, battalion commander of the 14th Division at "Nankou"; Major Nakao Sakuro, commander of the Independent Machine Gun Battalion of the 14th Division at "Lucheng"; and Major Takahashi Kenyemon, battalion commander of the 77th Regiment of the 20th Division at "Nankou." The above statistics include three major generals, five colonels, five lieutenant colonels, and six majors. The most noteworthy thing about the statistics is the dramatic change in the Chinese-Japanese casualty figures. Before March 1938, it took 23.5 Chinese casualties to kill one Japanese soldier in positional warfare. After March, with the change to mobile warfare, it took 1.4 Chinese casualties to kill one Japanese soldier in sieges, 3 Chinese casualties to kill 5 Japanese soldiers in mobile engagements, and the Japanese suffered 4 casualties for every Chinese casualty in night attacks. With China's continuous influx of new forces and the Japanese steadily weakening, the disparity in these ratios will continue to increase. It can be asserted that if they continue to support the long-term war in this way and greatly deplete their strength, the Japanese warlords are bound to fail. (5th Dispatch)

However, the purchase of the same type of materials within the same region should be handled by one agency in principle; (2) For the convenience of liaison, the entrusting agency may send special commissioners to reside permanently in the head offices of provincial banks or local banks in each province, or in the branch offices of important distribution markets; (3) There are three types of purchase methods: First, the entrusting agency and the provincial bank or local bank agree on a contract, and the provincial bank or local bank is responsible for delivering the goods, with the provincial bank or local bank bearing all profits and losses; Second, the entrusting agency entrusts the provincial bank to handle the matter on its behalf, and the price fluctuations are negotiated by both parties at any time, and the entrusting agency gives a commission as appropriate; Third, the provincial bank or local bank collects the goods itself and sells them to the Trade Commission and the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau, with the price negotiated at any time; (4) After accepting the entrustment, the provincial bank or local bank should engage in purchasing in the fastest possible way, and the required funds will be advanced by the bank. After the goods are handed over to the entrusting agency, the entrusting agency will pay the value of the goods in cash. If a provincial bank or local bank issues small denomination banknotes and needs to pay issuance reserves, it may negotiate with the entrusting agency to deposit the value of the goods with the central government as the bank's cash reserve for issuance, so as to avoid mutual transfers; (5) The delivery location for the goods entrusted for purchase should be the largest distribution market and the most convenient transportation area in the province, which should be negotiated by both parties at any time; (6) The responsibility for transportation, storage, and safekeeping of the goods entrusted for purchase shall be borne by the entrusted agency before delivery, and by the entrusting agency after delivery, but both parties should assist each other; (7) In order to facilitate the purchase of products, provincial banks or local banks should report the production status, price fluctuations, changes in transportation tools, storage facilities, etc. of various products to the entrusting agency at any time, so that both parties can handle them quickly. In war zones or near war zones, the military movements should be reported to the entrusting agency at any time in the fastest possible way. The entrusting agency should notify the entrusted agency of the situation in the international market and the price fluctuations of export products at any time; (8) Provincial banks or local banks should actively promote frugality, reduce domestic sales, and transport as much as possible abroad to earn foreign exchange for exportable goods; (9) Provincial banks or local banks should investigate the production costs and past market prices of products. If there is any intentional raising of prices or hoarding for speculation, measures should be taken to crack down on them; (10) If provincial banks or local banks lack transportation and storage tools, they may negotiate with the entrusting agency to jointly equip them, or apply to the local government and war zone commander for paid rental from the people, and the entrusting agency should submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to forward it to the Military Affairs Commission for the exemption of requisitioning transportation tools for the purchase of these products; (11) Regarding the insurance problem of storing purchased products, the Ministry of Finance should be requested to negotiate with the Central Trust Bureau to plan and handle it; (12) Inter-provincial trade should be closely coordinated by provincial banks and local banks in each province, and the supply and demand of goods should be reported to each other to address shortages and surpluses. The methods should be negotiated according to the situation in each province; (13) In order to facilitate the transportation of local products, provincial banks or local banks should establish transportation stations at various key locations, and intermodal transport stations should be established between Province A and Province B to facilitate convenience; (14) Civilian laborers used for transportation tools should be exempted from military service by the military authorities; (E) Regarding how to balance price fluctuations: (1) In a positive aspect, 1. For products that are the main local goods and are necessary for people's daily life, provincial banks and local banks should purchase or store as much as possible and accommodate funds when the price of such products falls too much (if funds are insufficient, they may also request re-discounting or re-mortgaging from the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank), or reduce their taxes, or facilitate their transportation, always maintaining their original price index as a measure, but if the price rises due to purchasing, the work of price stabilization and balancing should also be carried out; 2. Although the product is the main local product, it is not necessary for daily life. When the price of this product falls too much, provincial banks and local banks should provide low-interest loans as much as possible, and should investigate the sales stagnation or transportation difficulties. If necessary, they may contact neighboring provincial banks to negotiate sales or re-mortgage and re-transport various items. When the price rises too much, the reasons should be investigated. If it is a raw material needed by agriculture, industry, and handicrafts in other provinces, the local government should be requested to use political power to stabilize it; 3. Products that are daily necessities but not the main products of the area, the price of such products rises greatly during the production season, provincial banks and local banks should find ways to widely purchase and transport from places with abundant production, or use local existing institutions to accommodate their funds and facilitate their transportation, so that they can fully purchase and transport more from places with abundant production, but at the same time, they should sell them at fair prices in accordance with these regulations; (2) In a negative aspect, provincial banks and local banks should be responsible for compiling and investigating the price index of local products and daily necessities. If the price fluctuates too much, they should request the local government to find ways to stabilize it. At the same time, they should contact local chambers of commerce and trade association representatives to establish a price balancing association, with representatives from provincial and county-level administrative agencies, provincial banks, and local bank branch representatives participating and presiding over it. Those who hoard and speculate or refuse to sell for no reason should be reported by the balancing association to the local military police and administrative agencies for an order to sell at the price or search them; (F) Regarding how to help meet the needs of food: (1) Provincial banks or local banks in each province should report the production, consumption, transportation, and distribution of major food in their province to the central government and the competent authorities of neighboring provinces (such as the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau, etc.) at any time for reference in planning and adjustment; (2) For a certain kind of food that the province cannot supply itself or is in surplus but is needed by other provinces, provincial banks or local banks should cooperate with the competent production agencies to lend funds, and pay special attention to the lending of seed, agricultural tools, plowing cattle and other production factors to help them improve and produce; (3) When the supply and demand of a certain kind of food cannot correspond and the price fluctuates too much, provincial banks or local banks should assist the food management agency in purchasing, transporting, and selling, or use their own transportation to regulate the people's food; (4) Provincial banks or local banks should build warehouses and handle storage business in food distribution markets and convenient transportation locations to regulate supply and demand; (5) For food transportation, we should make the most of low-cost tools such as wooden boats, hand trucks, and livestock, so as not to make the cost too high. When necessary, provincial banks or local banks may organize their own transport teams, and local military police agencies should give them effective protection; (6) Storing food should pay attention to whether its quality can be durable, and it should be inspected and turned over frequently to prevent mildew. Try to convert new and old food every year; (7) The location of food storage should be connected with the local military and political authorities. The production is particularly small and will be important military areas in the future, and places where the people are gathered, such as western Hunan, western Hubei, southern Jiangxi, eastern Guangdong, western Guangxi, southern Shaanxi, and eastern Gansu, etc., should be specially maintained and stored in greater quantities to assist; (8) The Salt Affairs Agency has overall methods for increasing the production and sales of salt in various regions. Provincial banks or local banks should provide loans to salt production and transportation merchants. When necessary, they may contact the local Salt Affairs Agency to undertake transportation themselves and promote sales in the interior to help the people's food. Places where remittance is inconvenient should also find ways to facilitate communication or transport funds on their behalf to facilitate transportation and sales. Overall, the contents of the above cases are extremely detailed and thorough. In the future, the Ministry of Finance will supervise the financial industry to implement them effectively, which will surely contribute to the future of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction.

### Chamberlain Explains to Parliament the Contents of the Anglo-Polish Agreement, Mutual Assistance Nature Similar to Franco-Polish Alliance, Agreement Applies When Independence is Threatened

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain recently made a statement in the House of Commons today, explaining the circumstances of the government's talks with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, stating, "Our country and Poland have reached a complete compromise on certain principles. Previously, our government gave Poland a temporary and unilateral guarantee (according to the Prime Minister's announcement on the 31st of last month). Now, after consultation between the two parties, a permanent mutual agreement will be concluded to replace it. Before the official establishment of this agreement, Foreign Minister Beck provided our country with a guarantee, stating that Poland decided to accept the constraint to assist Britain, the nature of which should be the same as that accepted by Britain for Poland. One thing must be stated is that this permanent agreement is not directed at any country. The goal is that if the independence and sovereignty of Britain and Poland are directly or indirectly threatened, both parties should implement mutual assistance," etc. (6th Havas Dispatch)

Zhang Min's conclusion states that before the formal signing of this agreement, there are still prerequisite issues that need to be studied, such as when the mutual assistance guarantee will take effect. He also stated that during this negotiation, neither party was prohibited from establishing an agreement on peace with a third country. In short, the Anglo-Polish agreement currently under negotiation is generally similar in nature to the Franco-Polish agreement. (6th Haitong)

(London) Responsible persons here recently stated that the Anglo-Polish mutual assistance agreement should be signed and established within days. People in diplomatic circles say that the British authorities should go a step further and include all countries belonging to the "status quo maintenance faction." However, in the current situation, it is particularly difficult to establish a general agreement among Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union. The reason is that Poland is unwilling to associate with the Soviet Union, and because of its friendly relations with Hungary, it is unwilling to give Romania a solid guarantee. Certain aspects of the British side, in view of this, advocated that Britain should establish mutual assistance agreements with the Soviet Union and Romania separately on the basis of the Anglo-Polish mutual assistance agreement, and then establish similar agreements with the other three countries of the Balkan Entente, namely Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. (5th Havas Dispatch)

(London) This morning, all diplomatic and political correspondents of the London newspapers unanimously declared that Britain and Poland have now signed a "Joint Defense Alliance." British Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to announce the contents of the agreement in the House of Commons this afternoon. The newspapers believe that Britain and Romania may also conclude the same agreement. It is also heard that Poland is preparing to add supplementary clauses to the Baltic Military Alliance to adapt to the current situation. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Union will also join the "Joint Defense Alliance" after obtaining guarantees for its borders from the relevant countries. (6th Haitong Dispatch)

(London) According to Polish sources here, the diplomatic authorities of Britain and Poland have agreed that the mutual assistance agreement to be concluded should apply to all acts of aggression without any caveats. It is heard that the British side has promised to provide financial assistance to Poland to expand its military equipment so as to be able to cope with all incidents. As for Polish Jews, they may also be accommodated by the British colonies as appropriate. (5th Havas Dispatch)

(London) According to Polish sources, the Anglo-Polish talks have had the effect of making the Anglo-Polish alliance a reality. It is heard that the general principles of political and economic cooperation between the two countries have been agreed upon. It is heard that Colonel Beck advocated during the talks that Poland's position on Hungary should be included in the Eastern European Defense Alliance, and stated that Poland did not want the Soviet Union to join this alliance. According to Reuters diplomatic correspondent, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's talks will continue tonight and have reached a stage where a statement can be issued. It is expected that Chamberlain will report this matter in the House of Commons tomorrow. Perhaps a short meeting will be held tomorrow night to consider certain details. The results of the talks are expected to satisfy both parties. No detailed information was released by the British authorities tonight. (5th Reuters Dispatch)

"The Soviet Union is the only country in Europe that pursues a strong, consistent, and confident policy. We are not afraid of any threats. Once we encounter difficulties, we do not need to mobilize temporarily, nor do we need to seek allies, as other countries do. Our actions must be rapid and preemptive and not allow the enemy to have any breathing room," etc. (6th Havas Dispatch)

### Anti-Aggression Collective Action Should Not Ignore the Far East, Chongqing Newspaper Publishes Editorial

(Chongqing) Today's Ta Kung Pao editorial urges Europe to include the Far East when concluding any anti-aggression convention, and advocates that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs should propose to Britain, the Soviet Union, and France that any anti-aggression plan in Europe must also include the Far East. Europe is only trying to avoid war now, but in the Far East, war is already in progress. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should also consult with the US government and urge the United States to clearly distinguish between aggressors and victims of aggression when considering revising the Neutrality Act. This step is not only in line with the traditional Sino-US friendship, but also in line with the traditional US anti-aggression policy. (6th Reuters Dispatch)

### German and Italian Military Leaders Hold Important Talks to Discuss Unified Command in Wartime to Counter Britain and France's Encirclement Policy

(Rome) As far as people here know, Italian Army Undersecretary General Pariani is in Innsbruck, Austria, Germany, holding talks with German Defense Forces Commander-in-Chief General Keitel, discussing the issue of unified command in wartime. This move is used to cope with the military talks being conducted by the British and French authorities. (6th Havas Dispatch)

(Berlin) According to political figures, at a time when British and French military authorities are conducting talks, the German-Italian Axis is taking this opportunity to demonstrate its close relationship. According to the news of the meeting between German and Italian military leaders, it was originally scheduled to be announced simultaneously in Rome and Berlin tomorrow. The German side announced it one day earlier, apparently to respond to the "British encirclement conspiracy." (5th Havas Dispatch)

(Rome) According to reliable sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Leader Hitler had a long telephone conversation this morning and fully agreed with the military precautions that Italy has implemented. It is said that they discussed and agreed on actions. At the same time, Fascist officials refused to criticize the movements of the Italian army. (5th AP Dispatch)

(Berlin) According to news from the National Socialist Party, Germany is now putting pressure on Spain to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, as a counterattack against Britain's encirclement policy. It is heard that Italy, in order to obtain a new position to attack France and disrupt the sea and air bases of the British Channel, will soon also exert pressure on Spain. According to German observations, the Italian troops currently stationed in Spain will not only not withdraw, but will also be increased in order to suppress France. Furthermore, German newspapers strongly attacked Britain for Prime Minister Chamberlain's attempt to encircle Germany, and pointed out that the remarks made by British Minister Lord Stanhope on Tuesday were not only akin to delirious talk,... "It is the most serious attack on the policy of peace,... and the sensational rumors about the major events in Albania are of the same nature. (6th AP Dispatch)

### British and French Aviation Maintain Cooperation, French Air Minister Returns Home Satisfied with London Visit

The issue of unified command of the British and French air forces in wartime has now been resolved. France has indicated that if war breaks out, it is willing to allocate part of its air force to be under British command. (6th Haitong Dispatch)

### Internal Conflicts Between Two Dictatorial Nations: German Influence Extends into the Mediterranean, Deeply Resented by Italy

(Paris) Italian sources here stated yesterday, before the signing of the Anglo-Polish alliance treaty, that if Germany were to invade Poland, and if the scope of the war were limited to Germany and Poland, Italy might maintain neutrality. However, French political figures stated that this claim is not necessarily reliable. Given that France has already signed an alliance treaty with Poland, and Britain has accepted similar obligations towards Poland, Italy, even if it desires to maintain neutrality, may find it impossible. In the event of war, Italy's responsibilities will likely be limited to the Mediterranean region. This can be observed from the recent measures taken by the Italian authorities on Rhodes and the Spanish-owned Balearic Islands. Furthermore, these Italian sources also stated that because the Italian government has lost influence in the Danube region and fears Germany's expansion of influence along the Mediterranean coast, it is willing to overcome all difficulties to extend its influence into the Balkans through Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Greece. However, German influence has already extended to the Mediterranean coast. The German troops and military supplies in Spain are being replenished. The position of German advisors in the Spanish Nationalist government is at least equal to that of Italian advisors. Moreover, Germany's expansion of influence into Italian Libya in North Africa is increasing daily. In the past two months, German instructors have been assisting in equipping Italian military equipment being shipped to Libya, and German aviation is also very active there. (Havas, 6th)

### Stimson Speaks Out Righteously: Condemns the Actions of Aggressor Nations; the U.S. Should Unite with Other Nations to Curb Aggression; the Current Neutrality Law Needs Revision

(Washington) During a public meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today to discuss revisions to the Neutrality Act, former Secretary of State Stimson delivered a moving speech denouncing the aggressor nations and expressing support for China and other nations that have been subjected to aggression. He stated that the current international situation is abnormal and that this situation may last for years or even decades. Three of the world's seven great powers have abandoned the principle of "mutual respect between nations." These countries have also invented a very clever tactic that has been successful for several years. They frequently take unilateral actions to destroy previous commitments, treaties, and laws that hinder their outward expansion. Threats, aggression, and violations of existing treaties have become indispensable elements of these countries' policies. Since 1931, the invasions of Manchuria, North China, South China, Abyssinia, Spain, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Lithuania have all contradicted existing treaties and international law. The events we must address are revolutionary in nature. These three great powers are militarily in advantageous positions and have a superior offensive capability against their peace-loving neighbors. These countries often act in concert and threaten the transportation, finances, and national defense organizations of other countries. Therefore, it is imperative that all nations of the world take collective action in defense. Regarding the current Neutrality Act of our country, a major flaw has been discovered. That is, certain countries, especially those that may be enemies of our country in the future, are using this law to deprive the United States of its freedom of choice in foreign trade. We are still forced to treat the peace-loving and suffering Chinese people and their militaristic enemies in the same way, which is just one example. We know that if militarists can conquer China, they will further use China as a base to carry out aggression against other parts of the world, but because of the current Neutrality Act, we cannot distinguish between them. Regarding the recent events in Spain, the Republican government was the only legitimate government recognized by the United States. We deprived them of their right to purchase foreign military supplies because we implemented the Neutrality Act. On the other hand, the rebels in Spain were fully supported by Mussolini of Italy and Hitler of Germany. As a result, the legitimate government recognized by the United States was overthrown. This is not fair." (Havas, 5th)

(Washington) Former Secretary of State Stimson appeared as a witness before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to express his views on the revision of the Neutrality Act. He said that peace-loving countries should take collective action. If war breaks out in Europe this spring, and if our country's current Neutrality Act is not revised, the United States will likely be the next to be attacked after the invaded countries. The United States accounts for one-third of the world's production of various raw materials. Is it wise to use a large portion of these resources to "encourage countries that may be our enemies to step up their activities and step up their aggression over the past two years? Economic weapons can cause crises if they are not used properly, but when it is necessary to use these weapons, we are in a better position than any other country in the world." Today, certain governments are pursuing policies of aggression, and all international laws based on mutual respect between nations have been despised by them. Therefore, isolationism and neutrality laws based on past international law are no longer applicable. "The great crisis currently facing world culture is unparalleled since the end of the fourth century." Our Congress should give the President greater power to adapt to changing circumstances. The fear that the President will abuse his power in diplomacy is unfounded. Stimson then raised the question: "Is the security we enjoy now temporary? Are we going to be passive and seek temporary peace, or are we going to use our economic advantages in a moderate, resolute, and wise manner to prevent crises in the world (of which our country is a part)?" He speculated that if our country can do something for the world, the actions of the Axis (referring to the German-Italian Axis) can be reduced, and the threatened countries will be encouraged to reject all humiliating demands. Otherwise, countries will yield to power, and the United States will also face a crisis." (Havas, 5th)

(Paris) The re-election of incumbent President Lebrun has been commented on by various newspapers. The right-wing newspapers generally expressed their delight, saying that the stability of the French political situation and the common sense of the French people are clear evidence of this. The Socialist People's Daily published an article by party leader Blum, stating that although President Lebrun was not elected unanimously by the National Assembly, "he has been re-elected and has become the head of state whom we should respect. As for all the gains and losses of the French Republic, they should be settled with the Prime Minister, the head of the government who is legally and factually responsible." The Communist L'Humanité said that "this election failed to symbolize the unity of France in the face of foreign threats, which the people must regret." (Havas, 6th)

### Protecting Interests in China: British Government Considers Countermeasures; Parliamentarians Concerned About Security in Shanghai Concessions

(London) Conservative MP Morgan stated in the House of Commons today that since the Japanese government restricts export trade in North China and does not allow exports unless banknotes are purchased from Japanese-run banks, Britain should require that exports from North China not be allowed to enter British or British colonial ports unless they hold consular certificates proving that they have been remitted through British, American, or French banks. Undersecretary of State Butler replied in writing that Morgan's proposal, along with the general issue of protecting British interests in China, is under consideration by the government. He was unable to announce any decision at this time. The Undersecretary also answered a question from Conservative MP Stourton, saying that Foreign Secretary Halifax is awaiting a detailed report from Ambassador to China Kerr on the current status of the Japanese occupation of British cotton mills in Shanghai. The Undersecretary also answered a question from Conservative MP Graham, saying that the cooperation agreement reached between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities should result in an improvement in the situation in the so-called "bad areas" of Shanghai.

The Continental Edition of the New York Herald Tribune published a dispatch from its Rome correspondent, claiming that 'Italian naval and land forces have concentrated in the southern ports of Brindisi or in the city of Bari. At the same time, residents of the Albanian capital held anti-Italian demonstrations yesterday, and the situation is very serious. According to a radio broadcast from Bari on March 3rd, Italy and Albania are negotiating to strengthen the defense alliance treaty signed between the two countries on November 22, 1927. The Albanian people are deeply dissatisfied after hearing the news and have launched demonstrations to protest." (Havas, 6th)

Tirana - The people of Tirana are quite panicked today, as if awaiting the outbreak of an incident. Although there is a two-day holiday due to the birth of the Crown Prince, it is still very tense everywhere. After Albanians demanded independence over the weekend, small squads of Albanian soldiers continued to patrol the streets. Yesterday, Italian merchants sent their families back to Italy. Foreign consulates, including the U.S. consulate, have not yet planned to evacuate the people of their respective countries. Except for Italian trainers of the Albanian army, there are no Italian planes or Italian troops in Albanian territory. Italians began to evacuate last night, including Italian trainers. Italian charter tricycles transported Italians last night, and the remaining Italians will return to Italy this morning. It is reported that a large number of Albanians are heading to Vlora, which is within the Italian sphere of influence and has oil fields. The area is also the closest point on land to Italy. It is also reported that arms are being transported into the area. (Associated Press, 6th)

Tirana - According to today's news, because the Albanian King insisted on firmly refusing Italy's request to open airfields and occupy seaports in Albania, Italian expatriates have been ordered to withdraw. The only Italians now remaining in Albania are diplomats who are still negotiating with the Albanian government. The Albanian cabinet held a special emergency meeting last night to discuss the Italian-Albanian negotiations underway in the Yugoslav capital and whether to request Britain to guarantee Albania's territorial integrity. As for the ongoing negotiations with Italy, they are purely economic and financial in nature and do not involve seeking Italian assistance. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "According to the 1927 agreement, there is no provision for seeking Italian military assistance, and in fact, no one is threatening us."

### British Concern

(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this morning, opposition Labour MP Henderson asked whether the government was aware that Italian troops and transport ships were reportedly concentrated in the ports of Bari and Durazzo in Albania, and that Italy and Albania were in negotiations. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that the British Ambassador to Italy, Lord Perth, visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano on the 4th of this month to draw attention to reports that Italy had sent warships to Albania. Foreign Minister Ciano replied that the Albanian government had proposed on the 8th of last month to strengthen the current alliance treaty between Italy and Albania, and that the various external reports were not true. As far as I know, the negotiations between the Italian and Albanian governments have encountered some difficulties, but the nature of the talks is unknown to the outside world. Foreign Minister Ciano also stated that Italian interests in Albania have been threatened. It has been learned that an Italian cruiser and two smaller warships arrived in the Albanian port of Durazzo this morning. What the Albanian government thinks is something I have not yet received detailed reports on. According to newspaper reports, the Albanian government finds it difficult to accept any measures that conflict with its independent sovereignty and territorial integrity. The British Ambassador to Albania reported this morning that everything was calm as of 8:25 AM and that no incidents had occurred. But the British government will continue to monitor the situation in Albania closely. Henderson then asked whether the situation in the Mediterranean had changed, which would conflict with the Anglo-Italian Agreement of April 16th last year, and whether Ambassador Perth had urged the Italian government to pay attention to this point. The Prime Minister did not answer this question directly, but only declared in response to another MP that although Britain does not have direct interests in Albania, it is very concerned about general peace. (Havas, 6th)

### Yugoslav Emergency Cabinet Meeting

Yugoslav Capital - According to reliable sources, the cabinet convened a meeting at 11:20 PM tonight to discuss how Yugoslavia should protect its national interests in the event that Italy occupies Albania. It is highly unusual for the cabinet to convene a special meeting late at night, which shows that the government attaches great importance to this matter. Italian sources continue to predict that the Albanian situation will reach a boiling point. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Italy Continues to Send Troops to Spain: France Asks Spain for the Truth

(Paris) Following reports that Italian troops were recently sent to Spain again, the French government instructed General Petain, the ambassador to Spain, today to ask the Nationalist government for clarification. (Havas, 6th)

(London) According to sources revealed today, the Italian government has assured Britain that the Spanish Civil War has ended and that Italy will no longer send troops to Spain. (Associated Press, 5th)

(London) The "News Chronicle" today published an editorial with angry language, declaring that if Spain joins the Anti-Comintern Pact, there is no doubt that Spain will provide Germany and Italy with naval bases in the event of war. It was generally hoped that Franco would express gratitude for Britain's policy of non-interference after the end of the civil war, but his response has been such that Britain has missed the opportunity to use Spain as a bulwark against dictatorial countries. The communication lines of the British Empire and even the security of Britain and France are now threatened. (Haitong, 6th)

### Estonian Army Commander-in-Chief Scheduled to Visit Warsaw

Warsaw - Estonian Army Commander-in-Chief General Laidoner is scheduled to visit Warsaw on the 16th of this month. It is said that Polish Army Commander-in-Chief General Rydz-Śmigły visited the Baltic countries last summer, so General Laidoner's visit is reciprocal. (Haitong, 6th)

### France Focuses on Three Major Current Events The Tatar Strait to be Reopened Negotiations on the Sanjak Agreement are Underway

(Paris) Following Lebrun's re-election as president, Parisian political figures have once again focused on foreign political events, such as (1) the Montreux Convention and the Tatar Strait issue, (2) the Franco-Turkish Sanjak Agreement, and (3) the Mediterranean Security Pact. Regarding the first item, the 日報 (Daily News) declared that the original purpose of the UK in concluding the Montreux Convention was to restrict the passage of the Soviet Russian Black Sea Fleet through the Tatar Strait. Now, in order to obtain Soviet assistance to guarantee the integrity of Romania, the UK has once again agreed to reopen the Tatar Strait. (Sixth day, Huitong Telegram)

(Paris) From well-informed sources, it is learned that negotiations between France and Turkey regarding the Sanjak of Alexandretta are proceeding normally. (Sixth day, Reuters Telegram)

### British Naval Minister's Remarks Enrage Germany and Italy Newspapers Launch Fierce Attacks

(London) The Berlin newspapers and some Roman newspapers have criticized British Naval Minister Stanhope's speech in Portsmouth on Tuesday with their usual acrimony, accusing the British of warmongering and saying that Britain is now dominated by a psychology of chaos. (Sixth day, Reuters Telegram)

(London) British Naval Minister Earl Stanhope spoke to about a thousand guests on the British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" last night, saying, "The Duke of Kent was unable to attend due to a sore throat, and there are others who are also unable to come tonight, because when I was about to leave the Admiralty, it was necessary to issue orders to prepare the fleet's anti-aircraft guns. Before the guests boarded this ship, sixteen anti-aircraft guns were ready to give those who came a warm welcome." So far, the Naval Minister's remarks. Today, Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned this matter in the House of Commons, saying that Earl Stanhope's words were casual and not premeditated, and Earl Stanhope did not ask the newspapers to pay special attention to these words. Earl Stanhope merely said that some naval personnel remained on the ship to prepare the anti-aircraft guns, so they could not all attend last night's meeting. In a tense situation, preparing anti-aircraft guns is a common practice. The Admiralty issued an instruction that vigilance should not be relaxed even during special gatherings, and no other orders were issued. He was afraid that the Naval Minister's words might cause alarm, so he asked the newspapers not to disclose his words. Unfortunately, his efforts to prevent unwarranted public unrest were not entirely successful. However, this matter, no matter what, is enough to show that the British Navy is always on guard against unforeseen circumstances. (The audience laughed and cheered) Earl Stanhope later went to the Prime Minister's residence to explain everything. After the Naval Minister's remarks were first broadcast by radio, some criticisms were raised, viewing it as an alarming event. In fact, there was no reason to be alarmed. Therefore, he asked the newspapers not to disclose it, or to regard it as a special and important event. Earl Stanhope also explained the situation in the House of Lords, which was roughly the same as what Chamberlain said in the House of Commons, and said, "My remarks were originally to explain that the British Navy, even during the Easter holidays, is prepared for unexpected events. I did not expect that this would increase the Prime Minister's workload or cause others to be alarmed. This is what I am sorry for." (Fifth day, Reuters Telegram)

### Romanian Reservists Begin Demobilization The Situation Appears Calm on the Surface Hungary Does Not Forget Lost Territories from the European War

(Romanian Capital) The Romanian government yesterday disbanded the reservists who had been conscripted since March 15, and demobilization is scheduled to be completed by the 10th. Political figures here have welcomed this move, believing that it indicates that the political situation has eased. Although the border demarcation negotiations between Romania and Hungary are still in progress, Romania seems to no longer fear any hostile actions from Hungary. (Sixth day, Huitong Telegram)

(Hungarian Capital) The newspapers in the Hungarian capital are now focusing on the development of the Anglo-Polish talks in London, hoping that when the UK proposes a convention guaranteeing the territory of Romania and Poland, it will not forget that after the Great War, some Hungarian territories were incorporated into Romania regardless of ethnic principles. If the UK guarantees these territories, the UK's position will inevitably cause unnecessary burdens. (Sixth day, Huitong Telegram)

### Japanese Troops Invading Guangdong Province Harass Shunde and Xinhui Counties Japanese Troops Burn and Loot in Various Towns Japanese Aircraft Bomb, Killing and Injuring Over a Thousand Civilians

Hong Kong Dispatch: Since the Japanese troops in Hainan occupied various coastal areas, the Qiongya (Hainan) militia retreated to the mountains, guarding strategic passes to prevent the enemy from penetrating deeper. Therefore, the Japanese troops along the coast of the island have not succeeded in their attempts for the past month. Taking Qiongshan, Wenchang, Ding'an, Chengmai, and a corner of Ya County as examples, the total number of Japanese troops deployed is estimated to be 40,000 to 50,000. Part of them were transferred from Guangzhou and, after failing to achieve any success, were transferred back to Guangzhou to re-establish defenses in the northwest and two rivers. At the end of this month, the Japanese troops in Guangzhou increased to more than 10,000, most of whom were assigned to Huaxian and Conghua in the North River, and Zengcheng Shitan and other places in the East River. Later, it was discovered that the Chinese troops in the West River, comprising the elite forces of Guangdong and Guangxi, numbered no less than 50,000. Fearing that they would move east, the guerrillas in Shunde in the lower reaches of the West River would attack their rear. Therefore, a portion of the naval and air forces, together with the marines, were mobilized to put pressure on the Shunde guerrillas. Since the fall of Daliang (the county seat of Shunde), the Chinese guerrillas under Li, Pan, Zhu, and Huang, numbering about 4,000 to 5,000, have withdrawn to Rongqi and Guizhou and concentrated there.

Rongqi and Guizhou Fall One After Another

The Japanese troops attempted to dislodge these local forces and transferred more than 1,000 troops from Foshan to advance on Shatou at 5:00 AM on the 27th, and used motorboats to carry marines from Xiaohuangpu in Zhongshan County to attack Beilang in Shunde, cutting off the rear of Rongqi market. At the same time, the right wing and central route of the Japanese troops surrounded the entire city of Rongqi. The local militia, outnumbered and outgunned, withdrew to Xiaohuangpu villages in the ninth district of Zhongshan County, and Guizhou was also lost. After entering Rongqi and Guizhou, the Japanese troops engaged in large-scale looting. The local grain reserves and livestock were first plundered, and then they set fire to the markets and looted cash from wealthy households. Refugees fled to Zhongshan and Xinhui for temporary shelter. After entering the city, the Japanese troops set up camp on Dafeng Mountain in Rongqi. A large fire raged throughout Rongqi market all day long. The Japanese troops used aircraft to bomb the Chinese army's positions and fortifications. Incendiary bombs set fire to civilian houses, and the bustling market was turned into scorched earth.

Zhutou Mountain Falls, Jiangmen in Peril

After the Japanese troops captured Ronggui in Shunde, their ambition was unabated. They continued to transfer more than 1,000 troops from Daliang and Longjiang to Rongqi and Guizhou to guard the land and water transportation hubs, and dispatched a motorboat to Ganzhutang in Shunde, and three shallow-draft warships ventured into the Rongqi River, attempting to advance into Jiangmen in Xinhui. The county's guerrillas were ordered to stand guard. At that time, the waterway was controlled by Japanese warships, and ferries from Jiangmen to Rongqi were suspended. Rumors abounded, and the people of Jiangmen were in turmoil. Some prepared to flee to the Siyi region, while others risked going to Shiqi to escape to Hong Kong and Macau. On the evening of the 27th, dozens of Japanese shallow-draft warships and motorboats advanced to the Yinggezui River. On the morning of the 28th, under the cover of Japanese aircraft bombing, the Japanese marines attempted to land on the west bank of Yinggezui, but were blocked by the Chinese army militia until the afternoon. Around 3:00 PM, the Japanese shallow-draft warships sailed into the Zhutou Mountain River, which borders Xinhui and Shunde counties, and docked, opening fire on the troops defending the mountain. Around 4:00 PM, they covered the motorboats and landed the Japanese troops. The artillery fire was extremely fierce, the fortifications of the troops defending the mountain were destroyed, and they moved to new positions. The Japanese troops occupied Zhutou Mountain that night. With the loss of this place, the county seat of Xinhui and the port of Jiangmen were threatened by the Japanese troops. The Xinhui armed militia still tightly guarded Henggang near the fifth district. After occupying Zhutou Mountain, the Japanese troops temporarily set up camp under the cover of naval gunfire. On that day, more than a dozen Japanese aircraft flew to Xinhui County and Jiangmen in batches to bomb them, once in the morning, once at noon, and twice in the afternoon. Eighteen bombs fell on North Street in Jiangmen, destroying a British church. Seven or eight bombs also hit villages near North Street, killing and injuring more than 40 civilians.

Refugees from Xinhui Flee to Hong Kong and Macau

After the fall of Guangzhou, Jiangmen became the only channel from Hong Kong and Macau to the interior. After the Japanese bombing on the 28th, the residents fled, and water and land transportation was completely cut off. The Japanese troops had long coveted the area but were unable to allocate sufficient troops to go there. Recently, reinforcements arrived, and after encompassing Shunde, they planned to further invade Xinhui and Jiangmen, cutting off transportation to the non-military areas. On the evening of the 29th, they divided their troops into three routes to attack Jiangmen and Xinhui City. One route took more than 20 motorboats and set off from Huangjiao towards North Street, one route bypassed Zhoujun from Zhutou Mountain and invaded Waihai and Jiangmen, and one route spied on Shuinan Village from Henggang, rushing towards various places on the morning of the 30th. The Xinhui militia repelled the enemy at Tangxia, capturing more than 100 Japanese troops. The remnants of the Japanese troops retreated to Zhutou Mountain that morning. Therefore, the Japanese troops attacking North Street did not dare to land, and Jiangmen was saved. However, North Street, Jiangmen, and Xinhui were devastated by low-flying bombing by Japanese aircraft, and the number of innocent civilians killed and injured reached thousands. The Japanese troops on the route attacking Shuinan once rushed to the intersection of Xinzhao Highway and Jiangfo Highway outside Zhongshan Park, but were repelled by the Chinese army. In Jiangmen City, Japanese plainclothes troops were once discovered raising the Japanese flag in an attempt to disrupt the morale of the Chinese army, but they were soon annihilated by the Chinese army. After this chaos in Jiangmen, all agencies and bank offices were relocated to Xinhui City. As of the 30th, many refugees were still fleeing to Hong Kong and Macau. According to those who fled to Hong Kong, a mixed battle broke out in the suburbs of Jiangmen on the evening of the 29th. After the Chinese army arrived, they defeated the Japanese troops. Countless civilians were killed and injured in North Street by Japanese aircraft bombing. The majority of the Japanese troops have retreated to Zhutou Mountain. The Chinese army's fresh troops are now guarding strategic passes in Zhoujun and Waihai. In addition, Chinese aircraft are attacking Japanese boats on the river. With this containment, the Japanese troops will not be able to be so rampant. As for the mail sent from Hong Kong to Jiangmen, it has not been able to be delivered since the 29th. Most of the grain boats and civilian boats from Jiangmen to Hong Kong and Macau have also been suspended. On the 30th, 900 refugees from Xinhui fled to Hong Kong via Macau, and the situation was extremely dire. (March 31st)

### The Currency Situation in Fujian Province The Circulation Volume of National and Provincial Banknotes

Yong'an Dispatch: Fujian Province has long had contact with overseas countries, but its commerce has not yet been modernized. Most of the currency is hoarded, and the speed of cash flow is far less than that of Western countries, and even less than that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Therefore, it is difficult to make an accurate investigation of the amount of currency in circulation. However, since the central government issued a general order to implement the new currency system in November of the 24th year of the Republic, the amount of banknotes in circulation has greatly increased due to the efforts of the provincial authorities. After January of the 25th year of the Republic, the amount of banknotes issued by various banks in Fujian Province also saw a sharp increase. Taking only the Central Bank as an example, the monthly amount often reached around 12 million yuan, breaking the record for banknote issuance in Fujian Province.

In August of the 26th year of the Republic, the Shanghai Battle broke out, and the whole country fell into a state of war. The demand for currency in the Fujian market was unusually urgent. The monthly issuance of the Central Bank once exceeded 13 million yuan. Although it soon stabilized, it was enough to indicate the wartime commercial situation in Fujian Province and the consolidation of legal tender credit among the people. In addition to the Central Bank, there are also the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, which are designated by the government as national banks. Their issuance has been increasing since July of the 24th year of the Republic. As of August of last year, the Bank of China had increased from 741,000 yuan to 5,308,300 yuan, the Bank of Communications had increased from 309,000 yuan to 2,487,000 yuan, and the Agricultural Bank of China had increased from 213,000 yuan to 2,743,000 yuan. Among these four national banks, the Central Bank issued the largest amount of banknotes, followed by the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. After the implementation of the new currency system, the China Industrial Bank, because it was not designated by the government as a national bank, gradually withdrew the banknotes circulating in the market. By March of the 26th year of the Republic, there were only 33,000 yuan in the entire province. However, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the market lacked currency. As a temporary expedient, it was still allowed to issue banknotes, and the bank's issuance increased to 63,000 yuan, but compared with before, it was less than one-third. The face value of the banknotes of these five banks, except for the subsidiary currency notes issued by the Central Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China, the lowest denomination is one yuan, which is convenient for the settlement of large-scale trade, but small-scale transactions feel deeply inconvenient. This shortcoming needs to be remedied by local banks.

The Fujian Provincial Bank was established in October of the 24th year of the Republic. In the past three years, because of sufficient funds and good credit among the people, people are more willing to use its subsidiary currency. The subsidiary currency currently circulating in the market includes five denominations: five jiao, two jiao, one jiao, five fen, and one fen. By the end of the 27th year of the Republic, the amount issued was more than 12 million yuan, of which the five-jiao note was the most, reaching 10,364,741 yuan. The one-jiao note was slightly less circulated, with a total value of 1,267,490 yuan. The two-jiao note was less, only 393,292.600 yuan. Last year, due to the lack of copper coins in the market, a five-fen note was added from November. Since the beginning of the issuance, it reached 52,500 yuan by the end of the year. This year, a one-fen note was added, and the printing cost was far higher than the face value. It can be seen that the bank is purely for facilitating the flexible turnover of the people, not for profit. The bank's responsibility is to develop the financial industry in the interior and assist national banks. Therefore, in the interior of Fujian Province, the banknotes of the provincial bank circulate very widely. People in large cities are more willing to use the bank's banknotes for purchasing foreign exchange, and the bank also fully supplies foreign exchange transactions. At the end of the 27th year of the Republic, out of the total issuance of 12 million yuan, the amount returned to the treasury for purchase of foreign exchange included 3,169,734.600 yuan in Fuzhou, 280,000 yuan in Jian'ou, 2,288,000 yuan in Hanjiang, 70,000 yuan in Sandu, 689,400 yuan in Saiqi, 73,000 yuan in Xiapu, and 116,000 yuan in Zhangzhou. Therefore, the actual amount of banknotes circulating in the market has not reached 8 million yuan. When the reporter traveled to southern Jiangxi in February of this year, he learned that the subsidiary currency of the Fujian Provincial Bank circulates in 67 counties in that area. In Ruijin alone, it accounts for three-quarters of the total currency in circulation in the market. Therefore, among these 8 million yuan, a part has actually flowed into other provinces. Some may doubt that the bank's capital is 5 million yuan, and the paid-up capital is only 2.5 million yuan. Even if all the capital is used as issuance reserves, it is less than 60%. This is a misunderstanding of the bank's business operations. The amount of capital is only to indicate the extent of the shareholders' responsibility. As for the bank's banknote issuance reserves, it does not rely entirely on capital. There are many sources of bank funds, such as deposits, etc., which can be used as issuance reserves. Therefore, although the bank's capital is only 2.5 million yuan, its available funds are far more than this amount. It is found that the bank's issuance reserves are based on the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, with 60% in cash and 40% in guarantees. Before June of the 25th year of the Republic, the bank maintained the 60/40 ratio. After July, the cash reserves became more adequate, averaging more than 70%. For example, at the end of the 27th year of the Republic, the amount issued was 12,078,003.60 yuan, and the cash reserves were 9,251,251.50 yuan, accounting for 76.38%. The guarantee reserves totaled 2,826,752.10 yuan, accounting for 23.4%, and the contents were various unified government bonds, provincial construction bonds, short-term treasury bills, etc., and all have been converted according to market prices. In fact, the number of people who cash in subsidiary currency notes does not exceed 70%. Therefore, in the current situation, it is more than sufficient to cope with it. If the cash redemption exceeds the cash reserve ratio, all kinds of guarantee reserves have market prices and are sufficient to cope with it. With these sufficient reserves, its subsidiary currency notes have won good credit in the market and are circulating smoothly. Since the provincial bank is a bank related to the provincial government, it is often suspected that it is maintaining its finances and that it may inevitably print and issue banknotes as much as possible, and promote it with political power, which will inevitably lead to inflation. In fact, the promotion and maintenance of provincial bank notes do not rely on the power of the provincial government. The reason why it can circulate in the society is because it has sufficient reserves and can maintain its good credit. As for the amount of loans made by government agencies to the bank, the amount is very small, and the government has always maintained good credit. According to the bank's business report for the 26th year of the Republic, loans to government agencies were no more than 1 million yuan, accounting for only about 20% of the total loans. The province's finances, after the efforts of the authorities to plan, have shown significant effects in terms of increasing revenue. In terms of reducing expenditure, there has been a major tightening in recent years. Therefore, there is no problem with revenue and expenditure. Except for short-term transfers, there is no borrowing from the provincial bank. The provincial bank's loans are mostly used for agricultural, industrial, and commercial construction projects, etc., which are not only harmless but also beneficial to society.

### Yesterday, Various Circles Publicly Celebrated Ma Xiangbo's 100th Birthday; Chairman Wu Yunqi Delivered a Congratulatory Speech; the Assembly Telegraphed Congratulations to Hanoi; the Broadcast Birthday Celebration Will Conclude Tonight

Yesterday was Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday. Various circles in this city held a public celebration at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association. Over a thousand people participated, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The assembly also sent a telegram to congratulate Mr. Ma. The broadcast birthday celebration, held at the Aviation Radio Station, is scheduled to conclude tonight. Details of each event are recorded as follows:

Celebration Grandeur

The public celebration was held yesterday at 4:00 PM. The birthday hall was set up in the two-story hall of the Ningbo Tongxiang Association, with solemn and simple decorations. The presidium consisted of Wu Yunzhai, Chu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Yang Caoxian, Yuan Ludeng, Wu Zhaoyuan, Xu Qiufan, and Jiang Zhengchan. The general directors were Chen Peide and Han Jingqi, and the secretary was Yin Rangneng. First, the Guangci Hospital orchestra played music, followed by the entire assembly bowing three times in a birthday salutation. Chairman Wu Yunzhai delivered a congratulatory speech and read Mr. Ma's thank-you telegram. Mr. Yang Caoxian, a 101-year-old, as well as Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Jin Tongyin, gave speeches. Jiang Kesheng reported on Mr. Ma's virtues and career. Mr. Ma's great-grandson, Zhang Chongren, delivered a thank-you speech. Afterwards, a group photo was taken, and birthday bowls, birthday badges, and gifts were distributed, accompanied by performances such as New Asia national martial arts, amateur Peking opera, and Chinese music magic by the Hualian Association. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.

Chairman's Congratulatory Speech

Chairman Wu Yunqi delivered the opening address, stating briefly that today, the fellow villagers from Dan, Jin, Liyang, and five other counties initiated this birthday celebration, and all sectors of society participated in unison, demonstrating respect for both his age and virtue, and the admiration of all. Only those with great virtue can enjoy a long life. Mr. Ma's morals and career are known to all and need not be elaborated. He continued his congratulatory speech, saying, "I once heard of Lin Lei, whose lifespan reached the expected end. My Mr. Ma's virtue and prestige surpass him. With a yellow beard and white hair, he is a great elder of the nation. He is both respected and stern, a truly outstanding teacher. Mr. Ma's scholarship encompasses everything. Interpreters translate and transmit with diligence. Mr. Ma's conduct is upright and exceptional. He follows principles like spring and autumn, harmonizing with the spirit of purity and integrity. When summoned to the imperial court, he was granted a comfortable carriage and soft cushions, demonstrating exceptional courtesy to set an example for the people. In these extraordinary times, he maintains calmness. Unyielding to power, his achievements are remarkable. Moving from Hubei to Guangxi, he has relocated several times. Recently, he has retired in Hanoi, nurturing his nature and embracing truth, speaking and laughing freely, relying on his staff and shoes in the spring breeze, appearing even more robust. I humbly hear that a blessed day has arrived. I respectfully offer a cup of wine, wishing him health and longevity from afar. I am privately fortunate that we share the bond of being fellow villagers. Heavenly honors are equally respected, namely virtue and age. May he enjoy the blessings of the ninth and fifth, and the longevity of the sacred tree of eight thousand years. Mr. Ma embodies both longevity of life and longevity of impact on the world."

Speeches by Guests

Yang Caoxian then delivered a speech, saying, "I am not good at speaking, please forgive me. Mr. Ma's personality is exemplary, and we must emulate him, so as not to fail this grand gathering today. I am useless to society, specializing in odd jobs. Please everyone work hard and use the old man as a model." Yu Qiaqing followed, saying, "Mr. Ma's morality involves doing things for society and is admired by all. Today, the whole country celebrates his birthday. It is fitting that we have Mr. Yang Caoxian here. The two Mr. Ma and Yang mutually illuminate each other. It shows that longevity cannot be obtained only by taking medicine, but by doing many good deeds. I hope everyone pays attention to morality and jointly reaches the realm of longevity." Then, Jiang Kesheng from Danyang reported, stating briefly, "Of the five blessings, longevity comes first and is most difficult to obtain. Mr. Ma's longevity has three internal conditions, namely, love for the country, love for his hometown, and love for people. It also has three outward manifestations, namely, establishing virtue, establishing words, and establishing merit. To summarize, it is learning and righteousness. Mr. Ma's knowledge spans Chinese and Western cultures, and he is skilled in preserving his health. Therefore, he can enjoy a long life and make great contributions to society and the nation." Next, Yuan Ludeng delivered a speech, stating briefly, "Today's gathering is the first I have seen in my life. The weather is often bad during Qingming Festival. An ancient poem says, 'During the Qingming season, rain falls in torrents.' Today, the weather is also helping. Mr. Ma is selfless and most admirable. Although Mr. Ma is not in Shanghai, it is especially rare that the 100-year-old Mr. Yang Caoxian is present. If you all take Mr. Ma as a model, you will surely enjoy a long life." Then, Lin Kanghou delivered a speech, saying, "Mr. Ma is now in Lang Son. Today, we send our congratulations from afar. We not only wish him longevity but also wish him progress in thought for millions of years." Next, Jin Tongyin, a representative from Fudan University, delivered a speech, stating briefly, "Mr. Ma successively founded Aurora and Fudan Universities. At that time, there was a thirty-year age difference between students. Mr. Ma was able to make students of all ages get along harmoniously, which is most admirable. At present, we must unify our national thinking. Although Mr. Ma is old, his thinking is extremely new. Recently, someone came from Lang Son and said that Mr. Ma even has the appearance of returning to youth." Then, Wu Zhaoyuan delivered a speech, saying, "It is rare to live to be a hundred years old, but ordinary people often speak of a hundred years for birthday celebrations, which is inevitably too limiting. I wish Mr. Ma boundless longevity and also wish you all boundless longevity." Then, Yang Gonghe from the same village delivered a speech, stating briefly, "Mr. Ma, during the late Qing Dynasty, returned to Zhenjiang to advocate for the establishment of new policies, but his aspirations could not be realized. The relocation of the provincial government to Zhenjiang in the Republic, the construction of roads, and the development of transportation were all the same as Mr. Ma's plans from thirty years ago. An ancient saying says, 'The benevolent are long-lived.' The fundraising for birthday celebrations now is the meaning of 'the benevolent are long-lived.'" Then, Shen Kuibo from the same mountain delivered a speech, stating briefly, "Mr. Ma's way of preserving his health can be divided into two aspects, body and mind, namely, staying away from sensuality, wealth, and profit, and having a heart to eliminate evil completely." Then, Zhang Chongren, the representative of Mr. Ma's family, delivered a thank-you speech, stating briefly, "When I came to Shanghai from Lang Son, Mr. Ma had already heard that fellow villagers in Shanghai were preparing a public celebration and raising funds to help refugees. He asked me to convey his gratitude on his behalf."

### Relief Committee: Concern for Shanghai's Refugee Compatriots; Sends Personnel to Shanghai for Inspection and Condolences; Decides to Allocate 100,000 Monthly for Relief

Mr. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, concerned about the situation of refugees remaining in Shanghai, specially dispatched Secretary Lin Xiaogu from Hong Kong to Shanghai, to visit various shelters and convey the government's condolences on its behalf. In the future, the Central government will allocate 100,000 yuan monthly to supplement relief funds. The details of each are recorded as follows:

Inspecting Each Place, Comforting Refugees

Since the domestic migration following the Shanghai War, refugees from various places have flocked here, numbering as many as tens of thousands. Uprooted and impoverished, they face extreme hardship. Although various charitable organizations have tried to accommodate them, supplies are insufficient, and starvation is a concern. Mr. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, deeply concerned, allocated 100,000 yuan to be remitted to Shanghai for relief. Meanwhile, Mr. Yu Qiaqing led various sectors to organize the Refugee Relief Association to oversee relief matters. With the enthusiastic donations from various sectors, the results have been quite good. It is now known that Mr. Xu Shiying, concerned about the refugees in Shanghai, specially dispatched Secretary Lin Xiaogu to arrive in Shanghai via the inner harbor a few days ago. He immediately visited Mr. Chu Qiaqing and Mr. Huang Hanzhi, expressing his condolences for Yu and others' leadership in relief efforts. In recent days, he visited various refugee shelters on Dunxin Road and other places in the city to inspect the content of each shelter's operation and the living conditions of the refugees. He also conveyed the government's and Mr. Xu's condolences to the refugees on his behalf. The general refugees expressed their deep gratitude for the Central government's earnest concern.

Monthly Plan to Remit 100,000 to Shanghai for Relief

After inspecting various shelters in the city, Mr. Lin, in addition to expressing satisfaction with the operation of each shelter, also provided guidance on points that should be improved. According to a report by a reporter from the Modern News Agency, the Central Relief Committee has now decided, starting this month, to allocate 100,000 yuan monthly to be remitted to Shanghai to serve as relief expenses, to show the government's deep concern for the refugees. The method of distribution has already been agreed upon as follows: 35,000 yuan for the Refugee Relief Association, 30,000 yuan for the Charitable Organizations Joint Relief Association, 10,000 yuan for the Nanshi Refugee Area, and 15,000 yuan for the Cilian Relief Branch. It is reported that Mr. Lin, having completed his official duties, boarded a ship yesterday to return to Hong Kong to report.

### Japanese Police Examination Recruited by the Public Works Department

The Dalu Daily reports that, according to the Japanese Dalu Shinpo yesterday (5th), the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department posted a recruitment notice in Tokyo two months ago for thirty Japanese police officers and Japanese police departments. Initially, there were many applicants. However, when the employment examination was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last Tuesday and Wednesday, only seventy Japanese youth took the exam. A certain Japanese, the Deputy Police Chief of the Police Department, is now the chief examiner in Tokyo. Physical examinations will be held for two days during the examination period, and written examinations will be held on Wednesday.

### Cost of Living Allowance from the Public Works Department; Extended for Three Months; Reconsidered in June; Passed by the Board of Directors

On the 24th of last month, the Public Works Department's Selection Committee unanimously decided to request the Bureau to extend the temporary measures for issuing cost of living allowances to employees from April for three months and to reconsider it in June. The above proposal has been passed by the Bureau's Board of Directors on the 5th of this month.

### Bandits Enlisted by the Japanese Abduct and Extort; Nanshi Cloth Shop Owner Kidnapped; Japanese Sentries Remain Indifferent

Liu Tiecheng and Du Tianpeng, bandits from Pubei Beicai, have been committing all kinds of evil since being enlisted by the Japanese. A few days ago, they even crossed the Pu to the old cloth shop of Jiuji Wharf in Nanshi, extorting 1,000 yuan from the shop owner, throwing a threatening letter and instructing him to contact them in Beicai. The shop owner ignored them. On the third day, three bandits came and kidnapped the shop owner across the Pu. In the end, he was redeemed for 500 yuan. The armed kidnapping of the merchant passed through the Japanese sentry area, but they remained indifferent.

### Anti-British Propaganda Actually Invades the Concession; Distributed by Pro-Japanese Groups

The English-language Great American Evening Post reports that several leaflets have been pasted on the walls between Penang Road and Jessfield Road opposite Rue Robert in western Shanghai. These leaflets fiercely attack the National Government and discredit Britain's policy in China. There are also leaflets slandering Chinese leader Chairman Chiang on Yinghua Street near Jiujiang Road. It is widely believed that these leaflets were distributed by pro-Japanese groups at their expense. Some of those related to the distribution of anti-British leaflets are pro-Japanese Chinese "governments" that have recently launched a movement to incite anti-British sentiment among the Chinese masses. Anti-British demonstrations have also been held near Kaifeng. These propagandists are still engaged in propaganda in the Shanghai area, even invading the Public Concession.

### After the Lockdown of Zhenhai Port, the Waterway is Still Not Blocked; Various Parties Still Plan to Request the Authorities to Maintain Transportation; Vessels on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line are Temporarily Rerouted to Wenzhou

After Ningbo Zhenhai Port was ordered to be locked down at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line has been completely cut off. However, the gap in the blockade line has not been blocked. The old Taiping is still berthed at the Xinjiangtian Wharf in Ningbo, and has not moved. Various parties still plan to request accommodation to maintain transportation and to selectively dispatch ships. The original ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line have been temporarily rerouted to Wenzhou. The details of the investigation are as follows:

Shipping Industry Talks About the Truth of the Blockade

Since the Ningbo Defense Command received the telegram order from Chairman Chiang and announced the blockade of Zhenhai Port at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Zhejiang people in Shanghai have been extremely concerned. Those who are generally nervous have recklessly speculated and have groundless fears about the safety of Ningbo. However, according to a shipping industry magnate, the situation in Ningbo is currently very peaceful. There are no traces of Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port. As for the sudden announcement of the blockade this time, the Japanese warships have repeatedly shelled the Zhenhai Fortress in the past month, and the people in the urban area were quite uneasy. Therefore, they suggested that the authorities request the blockade of Zhenhai Port to prevent Japanese harassment. At the same time, the Defense Command also believed that the situation at that time was indeed very tense and believed that blocking the river was necessary. They reported the situation to the Military Commission for verification. The approval telegram was received on the 4th. However, according to the recent situation, there is actually no need for the blockade. It is only because of the order that they cannot resist it. Therefore, they announced the blockade starting on the 5th.

The Waterway Has Not Been Blocked

After the Defense Command announced the blockade of the Ningbo River traffic from the day before yesterday, all foreign ships remaining in Ningbo, including De Ping, Shan Tai, Hana, New Beijing, and Mou Fu, left Ningbo before 3:00 PM. They arrived at the port one after another yesterday morning. According to the crew of the Mou Fu, the ship left Ningbo at 2:20 PM, which was the last one. At that time, the old Taiping, which was preparing to be sunk for the blockade, was still berthed at the Xinjiangtian Wharf on the north bank of the river and had not moved. The Ningbo authorities had not heard of any intention to actually sink the ship. As for today's (i.e., yesterday's) report that "the Taiping will be sunk immediately after each ship leaves, etc.," it seems to be speculative. Also, Mr. Ren Shuntong, the ship owner of the Taiping, is currently in Shanghai. After hearing the news of the river blockade, he was quite concerned about the sinking of the Taiping. He immediately sent a telegram to inquire. According to the reply, he also said that he had heard nothing. Therefore, the gap in the blockade line of Zhenhai Port (i.e., the waterway) has not been completely blocked so far. According to the observation of the shipping industry, unless necessary, the ship will not be sunk.

Various Parties Still Request to Maintain Transportation

After Zhenhai Port announced the blockade and prohibited ships from entering and exiting, Shanghai-Ningbo shipping was completely cut off from 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. People from Shanghai and Ningbo believe that the transportation obstruction will greatly affect the commerce of the two ports and is closely related to the people's livelihood. Moreover, Ningbo is in severe food shortage and relies on supplies from other provinces. Now that it is blocked, the source has been cut off, and the people's food is especially feared. Recently, Ningbo has purchased a large amount of wheat flour, which has been loaded onto the Endeavor to be transported to Ningbo. However, due to the blockade, it cannot be transported. Therefore, all parties concerned still plan to request the authorities to allow the selective dispatch of ships during the blockade period to maintain transportation and transport necessary goods to regulate the situation. It is reported that the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and the Shipping Association are also discussing it.

Shanghai-Ningbo Line Ships Rerouted to Wenzhou

The ships originally sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line have now been temporarily rerouted to Wenzhou due to the Zhenhai blockade. Italian De Ping and Portuguese Meda are scheduled to sail directly to Wenzhou this morning. Others, such as German Mou Fu, American Hana, and Tang Sai, are also scheduled to sail to Wenzhou tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. As for the Portuguese Shan Tai, it plans to take the opportunity to enter the dock for repairs. The British New Beijing may be rerouted to Tianjin. At present, the number of ships on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, including the original Mei Fa, Tang Lu, Tang Qiao, Hai Fu, Bao Li, Hai Long, and Fei Kang, totals more than ten.

### Under Special Circumstances, the Shanghai Customs Administration is Damaged; Difficulties in Implementation Reported Based on Facts; Export Tax Rates are Handled According to Government Regulations

Luo Fude, the Commissioner of Customs of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs after the fall, forced by the environment, changed the import tax rate under these special circumstances. As for the export duty exemption exceeding the slight tax, it is because the government encourages the tax-free export of domestic goods. The details are as follows:

Customs Duty Exemption Exceeds Taxation

Jianghai Customs' export tax collection in August 1938 was 6,300,620 yuan, duty exemption was 14,894,263 yuan, slight tax in September was 9,474,771 yuan, duty exemption was 18,145,985 yuan, tax collection in October was 8,241,598 yuan, duty exemption was 14,660,309 yuan, tax collection in November was 10,026,600 yuan, duty exemption was 20,193,813 yuan, tax collection in December was 10,435,25 yuan, duty exemption was 17,514,399 yuan, tax collection in January 1939 was 11,384,241 yuan, duty exemption was 19,422,184 yuan, and slight tax in February was 10,531,048 yuan, duty exemption was 18,641,536 yuan.

Measures Under Special Circumstances

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Customs yesterday that the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, after the withdrawal of the National Army from Shanghai, the tax revenue was intercepted and deposited in the Japanese-owned Zhengjin Bank, and Japanese customs officers were added. The flag was forced to be changed, and the import tax rate was reduced. Although it is nominally the Chinese Customs and is under the jurisdiction of the Inspector General of Customs, in reality, the Shanghai Customs administration has been damaged. Regarding the export of domestic goods, foreign exchange should be settled, and the prohibition of goods used to support Japan, Inspector General of Customs Meier and Feng Zhibu issued orders to Jianghai Customs to comply. Commissioner Luo believed that there were difficulties in implementation and reported that he could not comply. It is said that he has obtained the understanding of the Inspector General of Customs.

Encourage Tax-Free Export of Domestic Goods

The value of export goods taxed in various customs offices in China is more than duty-free, but the Shanghai Jianghai Customs is the only one that is the opposite. The outside world is very unclear about the truth, but in fact, the export tax of Jianghai Customs has not been changed after the war, and is handled according to the tax rate stipulated by the government. Because Shanghai has always been the center of industry and commerce in the country, with numerous factories of domestic goods and a place where native goods are concentrated for export, the government has ordered that the export of machine-made domestic goods and major native goods should be exempted from tax to encourage the export of machine-made domestic goods and major native goods. Therefore, the export goods of Jianghai Customs, duty-free goods exceed the slight tax, of which 70-80% of duty-free goods are machine-made domestic goods.

### Shanghai Landlords Association Advocates for Eliminating Subletting Abuses; Hopes the Authorities will Solve the Transportation Problem; So that Landlords in the Northeast District can Return to their Former Residences

The Zilin Daily reports that the Shanghai Landlords Association held its annual meeting at the British Commercial Broadcasting Company yesterday (the 5th). Chairman Mei Lu appealed to all landlords to eliminate the subletting abuses prevalent in densely populated Shanghai. He also criticized the current situation in the western district of the city, the delay in opening the eastern and northern districts, and the lack of transportation convenience in these two districts. Mr. Mei said in his speech that the membership has increased since the last annual meeting, but there is still room for improvement. He hopes that individuals and stores related to real estate who are not currently members of the association will understand the benefits that can be gained from this organization and join. The founders of this association intended to make it an international organization. Last year, my conclusion was that we would make strong representations to the Public Works Department regarding the problem of refugees occupying members' properties. This has been done, and the Public Works Department has subsequently added shelters, and many members have been able to use their properties. Members are aware that the tenants of their properties,

Overcrowded , subletting and transfer of tenancies, must pay huge sums of money. Landlords generally do not know or approve in advance. Landlords should do their best to eliminate this abuse. Due to the situation outside the western district and the western district of the Public Concession, this association was established last year. If the eastern and northern districts of the Public Concession are opened, the population congestion in the two concessions south of the Suzhou River and the shocking situation outside the western district will undoubtedly be improved. This matter and lack

Convenience of transportation The authorities and relevant public convenience companies have repeatedly paid attention, but when these two problems have not been satisfactorily resolved, the former residents and small industrial landlords will not return to their original residences in the northern and eastern districts. I know that the Public Works Department police officers in these two districts have increased in order to restore residents' confidence, but unfortunately the transportation problem has not been solved.

### Guerrillas Block the Shanghai-Xichang Highway; Regular Chinese Troops Arrive in Changzhou-Xichang; Puppet Troops in Western Shanghai Executed on the Spot

The guerrillas controlling the Shanghai-Xichang Highway have now further blocked the highway to cut off Japanese military transportation. In the past, the Japanese side relied on this road for supplies. Now it has lost its effectiveness. Regular Chinese troops have arrived in Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan, and other areas one after another and are uniting with guerrillas and local forces to prepare to severely attack the Japanese army and wipe out the remaining enemies in Beijing and Shanghai.

Puppet Troops Trample on the Local Area

Xu Pu'cheng's unit of the puppet "Pacification Army" opened from the Jiaxing area to Hongqiao in western Shanghai, and rape and looting occurred every day. The villagers, unable to bear the puppet troops' trampling, relocated one after another. Unexpectedly, the puppet "army" became more intensified. Suddenly, on the evening before yesterday (the 4th), they colluded with a large group of bandits and carried out large-scale looting. The villagers who were unable to escape were spared. The next day (the 5th), the guerrillas learned of Xu's unit and went to attack. The puppet "army" did not dare to resist and abandoned their weapons and fled. Three puppet "army" leaders were captured on the spot and executed that evening. The people applauded and cheered when they heard the news.

Japanese Troops Fleeing from Sijing

Sijing Town in western Shanghai is an important route from Songjiang to Shanghai and has a highway that runs through Shanghai. The town is garrisoned by more than 40 soldiers from the Japanese garrison team, Heida's team. Yesterday evening (the 5th), it was suddenly attacked by guerrillas. The fierce fighting lasted for several hours. The Japanese army was defeated and collapsed. The remaining enemies fled toward Songjiang. In this battle, seven Japanese soldiers were killed and more than a dozen drowned in the river. The town is now controlled by the guerrillas.

### British Business Leaders in this Port Visit Ambassador Craigie; Report on British Interests in China; Japanese Newspaper Reports that Ambassador Craigie is Scheduled to Leave Shanghai Today

Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, arrived in Shanghai with his wife on the Canadian Empress from Japan. He arrived at the port at 12:30 PM on the 5th. He was greeted by Philip, the British Consul General in Shanghai, and others. They then took an embassy car to Ambassador Cole's residence on Dunxin Road. At the invitation of Ambassador Cole, they had dinner at the Ambassador's residence, accompanied by Consul General Philip. According to Ambassador Craigie, this trip is a leisure trip using a vacation. However, the general view is that Craigie's arrival has political implications. Craigie's entourage is quite simple, with only two embassy staff members. According to Japanese newspapers, Ambassador Craigie will leave Shanghai on the Japanese ship Yasukuni Maru on Friday (today) to return to Japan after meeting with Sir Cole. However, according to Ambassador Craigie, he will have a week's stay in Shanghai. He will determine the date of his trip after Sir Cole goes to Chongqing. Generally speaking, the date of Ambassador Craigie's return to Japan must be after Ambassador Cole's meeting to obtain the results. The annual meeting of British business leaders in this port is scheduled to be held on the 15th. Yesterday, British business leaders in this port visited Ambassador Craigie on Dunxin Road one after another to report on British interests in China and the general situation.

### The Ministry of Finance Establishes a Foreign Exchange Administration Office in Haikou to Handle the Settlement and Sale of Foreign Exchange for Native Goods

The Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission handles the settlement and sale of foreign exchange for native goods. After purchasing the main native goods across the country and concentrating them in Hong Kong for export, and for the export of tung oil and other two or three types of native goods, foreign exchange must be sold and settled with China and Traffic Banks. Since its implementation, it has been quite successful. Now, because it is from the port to Hong Kong, a Foreign Exchange Administration Office has been specially established in Haikou, which has been implemented since the 20th of last month. All native goods exported from Haikou should also be settled in foreign exchange.

### Quick Sketch of Ma Shou

— Nanshan

Remembering the celebration of the birthday of the national elder statesman Ma Xiang, I went to the Ningbo Native Association on Rue Ratard yesterday afternoon at four o'clock to remotely offer my congratulations. When I arrived at the venue, there was already no empty seat. The 101-year-old Yang Caoxian and Elder Yu Qiaqing had all arrived. During this national crisis, Elder Xiang's long journey to the southwest has made those who went to celebrate admire the greatness of Elder Xiang's morality and literary talent; at the same time, they also feel who is making it impossible for us to share a hall with Elder Xiang in today's celebration!

In the middle of the venue, a silk banner of "A Ray of Light in a Dilapidated Temple" from the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association and congratulatory couplets from the Zhenjiang Native Association were hung. The calligraphy of the 101-year-old Yang Caoxian is admired at home and abroad; and his works have been seen three times, one is the large-character "Longevity" congratulatory banner for the Refugee Cooperative, one is Elder Yang's congratulatory couplet "National Elder of China, Global Mentor," and one is the commemorative couplet "One Meeting, One Year Older; Centenarian Host, Centenarian Guest." The calligraphy is vigorous and can be called a masterpiece.

After Chairman Wu Yunqi gave a congratulatory speech, Elder Yang followed with a congratulatory speech. He can truly be called a white-haired youth. He delivered a fifteen-minute speech without showing any fatigue. He finally solemnly said: If everyone contributes to society with Elder Xiang's spirit for the nation and the country, then "who dares to deceive us?" Elder Yang repeated this sentence "who dares to deceive us" three times, and also encouraged Chinese compatriots to repeat it three times, which shows that Elder Yang's words were sincere and can serve as a model for young people.

The reporter visited Elder Yang in the venue. Although he is over a hundred years old, he walks as usual, and his hearing has not diminished. According to Yang, he is only half a year older than Elder Xiang, because Elder Xiang's birthday is in February, while his is in July. Elder Yang remarried and has three sons, the second of whom is already fifty-two years old this year. He said that he does not have a fixed time for waking up in the morning and going to bed at night, and his diet is also casual, with both meat and vegetables. As for the art of health preservation, he does not have any other exercises besides freehand exercises. After returning from overseas, he has been living in Xinmin Village on Malong Road in Shanghai. He feels that the air in Shanghai is still acceptable. Recently, he only feels that his hearing is slightly inconvenient, but when talking with the reporter, Yang was in high spirits. More than a dozen elderly people aged seventy or eighty were present in the venue, but their gait was healthy, and it seemed that none of them were as good as Yang. Although Yang's beard and hair are white, they appear healthier than the mottled beard and hair of ordinary eighty-year-olds. He wears a loose-fitting Chinese-style outer coat, which is fastened with a belt instead of buttons. His complexion is slightly ruddy. When he meets people, he bows at a ninety-degree angle, with a humble and amiable demeanor, making him the most admired person in yesterday's venue.

Those who participated in the celebration ceremony yesterday used their birthday gifts for refugee relief, and received souvenir badges and longevity bowls and chopsticks with Elder Xiang's calligraphy upon presentation of receipts. The gathering of young people in Western suits and leather shoes, elderly people with white hair, and young girls with rosy cheeks was truly an unprecedented grand occasion in Shanghai.

### Firefight Between Puppet "Military Police" in Pudong; Puppet Self-Defense Corps Disbanded; Internal Conflict Due to Mutual Blame in the Case of Kidnapping the Owner of the Hua Hua Farm

A firefight occurred between the puppet "Military Police Team" and the puppet "Yangjing District Self-Defense Corps" in Pudong the day before yesterday afternoon. Several puppet "leaders" and others were imprisoned, and the puppet "Self-Defense Corps Headquarters" was taken over by the Japanese army. The puppet members fled. Detailed information obtained is recorded below:

Conflict Arises from Kidnapping Case

Bandits and puppets are active in the area along the coast of Pudong. Since the kidnapping of Chen Yinying, the owner of the Qichangzhan Hua Hua Farm, last month, a huge ransom of 100,000 gold has been demanded, and he has not yet been released. The Japanese and puppet sides attach great importance to this case. The "Puppet Military Police Team" and the puppet "Self-Defense Corps" each have real responsibilities and blame each other, thus arousing suspicion. Both suspect the other party of being the kidnapper of Chen, and in front of the Japanese army, they attack each other, forming a major feud, with little chance of reconciliation.

Both Sides Open Fire

At one o'clock the day before yesterday afternoon, the puppet "Military Police Team" suddenly sent three puppet "detectives" to the Hua Hua Farm to inquire about whether the farm owner had been released. The puppet "Self-Defense Corps" learned of this and believed that the three were related to the kidnappers. More than ten puppet "members," including Yang Dabaozi and Xu Songlin, carried pistols and went to surround and arrest them. Two of the puppet "detectives" also had pistols and exchanged fire with each other. The puppet "detectives" were outnumbered. Two of them with guns fled west, and one puppet "detective" without a gun was captured by the puppet "members" and taken to the puppet "Corps Headquarters" for detention.

Puppet Corps Searches for Weapons

Unexpectedly, the two puppet "detectives" who escaped reported to the puppet "Military Police Team." The puppet "Captain" then reported to the Japanese Zengtian Military Police Branch, accusing the puppet "Self-Defense Corps" of obstructing puppet "official duties" and detaining puppet "detectives." The military police team then sent more than twenty armed military police to search the puppet "Corps," obtaining an unlicensed six-inch pistol. They then tied up the puppet "Squad Leader" Chen Guotai and Cao Jinxiang with ropes and detained them along with the gun. The puppet "detective" who had been detained was released. They then went to search the puppet "Leader's" house and also found an unlicensed six-inch pistol in the residence of the puppet "Deputy Leader" Yao Jinxiang. They then believed that the puppet "Corps" was privately hoarding weapons and harboring evil intentions, and launched a large-scale investigation.

Two Puppet Leaders Arrested

At this time, the puppet "Head" Fan Futang and the puppet "Deputy Head" Yao Jinxiang separately reported to the Japanese Navy and the Xinhui Mountain Japanese Army because they did not understand the situation. Each sent more than two hundred soldiers to surround the Qichangzhan Town, cutting off traffic on Pudong Avenue. Seeing the Japanese military police present, the Japanese Navy and Army knew it was difficult to retreat. At the same time, the Japanese military police captain notified the Navy and Army departments to detain the puppet "Leaders" Fan and Yao. They were taken back to the military police team that night for detention.

Japanese Army Takes Over Puppet Corps

After the incident, more than one hundred puppet "members" fled. No one was in the puppet "Corps Headquarters" on the south street of Qichangzhan in a moment. The Fourth Squadron of the Japanese Navy sent a squad of soldiers to occupy the puppet "Corps" yesterday morning. All the puppet "documents and books" were copied by the Japanese military police. Therefore, the puppet "Police Corps," which was established in August, came to an end.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Bids Farewell to Deputy Chairman

According to the North-China Daily News, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession held a banquet at the Cathay Hotel on Tuesday evening to entertain the outgoing Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. MacKinnon. Dozens of people including Chairman Fessenden and council staff attended the banquet. Mr. Fessenden delivered a speech first, praising Mr. MacKinnon's character and hailing him as an example of the British. Mr. MacKinnon also gave a speech in reply, and encouraged everyone to work together to solve some current difficult problems and get to the day where they would be happy again. Mr. Fessenden took the opportunity to bid farewell to Deputy Treasurer Bourne, who is scheduled to leave his post at the end of this month, and thanked Mr. Bourne on behalf of the Bureau for his diligent service during his tenure.

### Beiguang Special Bright Light Bulbs Granted Patent for Five Years; More Electricity Saving, Higher Brightness

The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Technology Encouragement Review Committee issued the 28th Year Hezi No. 18 Review Decision. According to the application submitted by electrical inventor Shu Minghai, the invention of Beiguang Special Bright Light Bulbs is requested to be patented for ten years.

### Scout 50th Troop Headquarters Moved to Chongqing

After the 50th Troop Scout Headquarters of this city withdrew from Shanghai and engaged in transportation service work, it initially set up its headquarters in Hankou, then moved to Changsha, and then moved to Qiyang. Recently, to facilitate command, it has found a new site in Chongqing and moved into the new site for office last month. It is reported that its telegraph registration number is 0050.

### Japanese Merchants Levy Heavy Taxes on Fresh Pork; Pork Merchants Firmly Oppose; Willing to Sacrifice Business If Necessary; British Ships Unload Pork in Shanghai Yesterday

Japanese merchants attempted to monopolize the fresh pork industry, obstructing British ships from loading fresh pork in Jiangbei and other places, and forcing them to load it on Japanese ships and extorting fees. After the pork merchants firmly opposed, the pork transported by the British-owned Kristine Maersk wheel of Lai Ci Foreign Company and the Wuxue wheel of the British-owned Taikoo Company, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, initially stopped unloading pork due to the Japanese-owned Dalu Wuchan Company charging an extra fee of two yuan per head, causing a dispute. Although the fresh pork from the two ships has been unloaded, the dispute has not yet been resolved. The pork merchants have already held a meeting and resolved to unanimously oppose the extra fees, willing to sacrifice business if necessary, but hope that the Japanese merchants will voluntarily give up the attempt to monopolize and stop collecting extra fees.

### The Crisis of Husband's Kidney Deficiency in Spring

[

(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road

(Time) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Closed on Sundays

Although it is a beautiful spring, with boundless spring scenery and colorful flowers. Although it is a happy spring, with affection and endless happiness! But for men with kidney deficiency, not only do they not have a share in these, but they also increase their spring sorrow and hatred, and instead complain about spring! This cannot be blamed either: a healthy couple, in the face of this beautiful scenery, will inevitably have deep affection and fly with joy, organizing a happy family and giving birth to clever children, living harmoniously, how beautiful and pleasant life is! On the other hand, a man with kidney deficiency, even if he has a beautiful wife, during this moonlit and breezy spring night, the couple's life will also be different dreams in the same bed, or even cause quarrels, love to break down, and the family falls into a tragic situation of discord, is this not a greater offense to spring?

What is even more serious is that if kidney deficiency is prolonged and not treated, the symptoms will worsen after warming in spring. All symptoms such as brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, nocturnal emission, incomplete development, thin sperm, and infertility will occur successively, then dying out, causing a yellow and thin face, premature aging, or even a disease and death, an early death, how similar is the crisis!

According to medical experts, the reason why men have kidney deficiency is mostly due to early self-abuse and nocturnal emission, or post-marital licentiousness and overwork, resulting in the exhaustion of the fluid from the reproductive glands. Therefore, the most effective treatment is to use the reproductive gland supplement method. This method was invented by Austrian physiology master Dr. Steinach. In clinical experiments, it has been effective in curing diseases, prolonging life, and rejuvenating, so it has shocked the modern medical community. However, the surgery is relatively difficult and cannot be popularized to the public. Later, continued experiments by great doctors such as (Jamst) James De extracted the reproductive gland hormone from strong animals such as orangutans and sea dogs, and replicated it into a preparation using scientific methods. In order to commemorate Mr. Steinach's invention, it is named "Steinach's Reproductive Hormone." The drug is for both men and women, and can be taken internally. The method of administration is simple. After taking it, it can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood, and nourish the nerves within one day and night, exerting great power. If you can continue to take it, the above symptoms can be completely cured in a short period of time. It can also increase body weight, increase appetite, and double your health. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hemet's Semen-Solidifying Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that both the root and the branch can be treated, and the effect will be faster. If the patient is in this city, he can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by an expert doctor, and then use various latest scientific therapies such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery to ensure a cure.

### Nocturnal Emission is a Termite of Health

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Being disease-free is a blessing, and health is really the most valuable thing for us. But many young people do not know the stakes and take health as a child's play. This is because young people are in the period of spring love, because of sexual curiosity, they first commit self-abuse, and then nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission is treated early, it can be harmless to health. The worst thing is that young people do not take nocturnal emission seriously. Excessive nocturnal emission causes accumulated blood to dry up.

The semen in our body is the most important endocrine gland, which functions to regulate metabolism, prosper development, and nourish various nerves. If the sperm is dry and the blood is exhausted, the metabolic function will inevitably decline, resulting in a yellow and thin face, and premature aging. If the development function is blocked, it will show incomplete development, short stature, and small genitalia such as fingers. The three major nerves of the brain, spinal cord, and sex are weakened. All symptoms such as brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, dizziness, back pain, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, impotence, and scattered energy will occur successively. Not only will this kind of youth lose all health and accomplish nothing; Even in the marital life of passing on the family line, which is indispensable in life, it will not be complete and be hated by the wife! Therefore, it will fall into the most tragic situation in life! Therefore, young people with nocturnal emission should immediately realize this and seek early and thorough treatment. The most effective treatment is to take "Hemet's Semen-Solidifying Tablets." Because this medicine has the function of consolidating the sperm gate, calming the nerves, reducing dreams, and allowing you to sleep peacefully, the nocturnal emission will heal itself. If the above symptoms have been caused by nocturnal emission, you must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it, you will be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and you can also prolong life. However, if the patient can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by an expert doctor, and then use various scientific therapies, he can be guaranteed to be cured.

Fitness and Beauty

### The Breast Peak is the Vanguard of Female Fitness and Beauty

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Modern women with newer minds have abandoned their slender and weak qualities and value healthy beauty. Healthy beauty contains many conditions. Such as the plumpness and firmness of muscles, the proper proportion of body length, the plumpness and flexibility of the buttocks, etc. But the most important point is the breast peak.

The breast peak is valuable for its tall and elastic, slightly rising and falling when walking, which makes it appear more elastic and rich. Heterosexuals are unconsciously attracted to it, and there is a general idea of feasting on beautiful scenery and being absent-minded! However, this kind of beautiful breast peak will only be possessed by healthy women. Those women who are physically weak, congenitally insufficient, have irregular menstruation, and have lingering leukorrhea, because the endocrine of the ovary is insufficient, making it difficult to develop, how can the breast peak be tall and towering:

What is even more ridiculous is that there are many ugly women with shriveled breasts who wear bras to deceive themselves, but when the clothes are thin or the silk skirt is just untied, this ugliness will always be revealed immediately. Therefore, the smartest way is to rely on scientific medicine to seek remedy. According to the test of famous world gynecologist Kang Delin and others and myself, it is unanimously recognized that taking the ovarian preparation female "Reproductive Hormone" is the most effective and effective for the symptoms. Because this preparation is well prepared, after taking it, it can nourish the ovarian function within one day and night, prosper the metabolism, adjust menstruation, warm the uterus and stop the belt, and if you continue to take it, it is guaranteed to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and make the breast peak tall and red cheeks, turning ugliness into coquettishness.

### The Key to Curing Gonorrhea

No one does not know that gonorrhea is easy to spread and difficult to cure. But I do not know that the matter of curing gonorrhea is not as difficult as imagined by ordinary people, because the reason why gonorrhea becomes difficult to cure is due to the private abuse of ready-made music on the market and the general outdated mechanical surgery, I do not know that the gonorrhea poison is good at changing, and the condition is tortuous and subtle. It is necessary to have honest knowledge, rich experience, and the latest scientific methods to make a careful diagnosis. After diagnosing the root cause of the disease, and then adopting the most scientific method to make a thorough cure, then even the general doctor thinks it is difficult to cure white turbidity. I can definitely cure it completely.

Now, to speak frankly about the core of the problem of radical cure lies in whether the doctor is willing to be responsible for the treatment, and the patient is willing to be determined to receive treatment. The doctor's greatest task for general gonorrhea is to eradicate the pathogen... diplococcus, and the toxins produced by gonorrhea. The method of treating gonorrhea by general short-sighted doctors is nothing more than anesthetizing the nerves to stop the pain of acute gonorrhea and local surgery in order to clear the gonorrhea on the surface of the urethra. They do not know that the pain of acute gonorrhea is a physiological resistance function. If anesthetic needles and medicines are used, the body's own resistance will be reduced instead. As for local therapy, at most, it only eliminates some gonorrhea on the urethral mucosa, and it can never eradicate the gonorrhea in the deep parts and blood. As for general ready-made medicines on the market, it is even more unworthy of mention. Now, if the German-based gonorrhea flattening electrotherapy is adopted, the bactericidal power can penetrate into the lesion tissue, and the gonorrhea poison can be filtered. If it only kills bacteria and does not filter the poison, the patient will not be able to be cured quickly due to chemical changes. Others, such as Xi's serum, cooling method, massage method, and injection of self-bacterial vaccine, are also conditions for curing gonorrhea when used appropriately.

### Encroaching on Silk Involves Family Affairs; Sister-in-Law Faints in Court; Sister-in-Law Objects to Younger Uncle's Marriage, Older Brother Even Removes Yun Di's Position

The Meihua Printing Factory at No. 2, Lane 412, North Zhejiang Road was established by Haimen native Fang Qixian, who raised funds, and Fang served as manager. His two younger brothers, Qichang and Qishou, also worked in the factory. Qichang, who was already a young man, relied on his brother and sister-in-law because both his parents had passed away. Last year, his sister-in-law tried to marry him a wife, but Qichang found it difficult to be satisfied with the object chosen by his sister-in-law and firmly refused. After that, he sought a partner on his own. Last month, he found a young woman from Ningbo named Zhang Cailing, who was 28 years old. They got along with each other and thought they could become life partners. They made an agreement to live together, but his sister-in-law did not agree and came out to obstruct it. Qichang did not want to succumb, so he proceeded with the marriage on his own. During the Chinese New Year, he completed the wedding ceremony and rented another house in Old Ning'an Lane, Haining Road, and did not live and cook with his brother and sister-in-law, hoping to avoid conflicts between sisters-in-law and brothers. However, Qixian's wife, seeing that her younger uncle did not respect her opinion, became angry and often slandered her uncle in front of Ye Zhan. Qixian also had a fear of his wife and, in order to comfort his wife's mood, dismissed his brother's job as a runner the month before last on the pretext of making his brother unemployed. Qichang suffered this blow and knew that it was difficult to maintain his life on an isolated island. The debt of 500 or 600 yuan for marrying a wife, since he lost his job, the creditors urged him to pay it back as urgently as fire. People were eager to make a living, and suddenly, at 9:00 pm on the 4th, he called Meihua Printing Factory, claiming that he had learned that someone outside said that the silk in the factory was all Japanese goods and would come to the factory for inspection, so he immediately hired a car to transport the goods to another place for storage. At that time, all the factory staff had gone out, and the person who answered the phone was his youngest brother, Qishou, an apprentice, so he could not cope. The two Xiang Sheng cars hired by Qichang had already arrived in front of the factory, and Qichang directed the car to take 67 pieces of silk from the factory and loaded them into two cars. Qichang called his wife, Zhang Cailing, to escort the goods to the clothing store opened by Wu Shiquan at No. 6, Lane 132, Park Road, and sold 12 pieces. The rest of the goods were transported to a rented house in a lane on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. That night, Qixian returned to the factory and was informed of everything by Qishou, so he reported to the Huishi Police Station and sent detectives Feng Qishan and Hu Guangrong to investigate. They learned that Qichang would go to Wu Shiquan's place the next day to sell, so they waited at Wu's house. When Qichang arrived, he was arrested and questioned. He learned that his wife was hiding in Room 325 of the Far Eastern Hotel and was also detained, and all the stolen goods were seized. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Because the goods of Meihua Factory were not missing, Fang Qixian was unwilling to confront his brother in court and did not personally file a case, but the factory director Zhang represented him in court to await instructions. However, when Judge Fang Qinghuan ordered Fang Qichang and his wife to stand in the defendant's position to be interrogated, Zhang Cailing suddenly fainted and fell to the ground, calling out and not knowing. The Chinese and Western detectives quickly helped her to sit in the hearing seat and gave her artificial treatment. As a result, she gradually recovered. The court then ordered her to sit next to her husband's defendant column. Then the trial began. First, Zhang Shizhu, the proxy lawyer of the police station, stated the fact that the defendant summoned Xiang Sheng cars to transport the factory's goods and prosecuted him for fraud, requesting a trial. Then, the factory's Zhang clarified that the silk goods were all delivered by Yong'an and Xinxin companies for dyeing. Then, Fang Qichang was questioned, admitting that he intended to sell the goods and get money to pay off debts, so he did this. His wife, Zhang Cailing, said that her husband did not tell her in advance, so she really did not know the truth. Judge Fang believed that it was necessary for the accuser Fang Qixian to be present in court, so he adjourned the case for another trial, and the defendant was sent back to custody and a warrant was issued for his arrest.

### A Western Feat: Sailing to America in a Sailboat, Aiming to Reach the San Francisco Exposition in About 70 Days

The *North-China Daily News* reports: The first sailboat scheduled to sail from Shanghai to America this year is scheduled to set sail from the floating dock at the Garden Bridge at twelve noon today (the 6th), following the old trade route, making a non-stop voyage to the San Francisco Exposition. The captain, Anderson, has been a navigator for the Yangtze River Navigation Company for many years. Accompanying him are Anderson's wife, Zolek Kvitnik, and three Chinese crew members. The sailboat belongs to Mr. Mortimer of the Sino-American Book Company and is equipped with a 14-horsepower motor. Mr. Anderson believes that if all goes well, the entire journey can be completed in about 70 days. However, to prevent unforeseen circumstances, the ship has been equipped with two large water tanks, which can store enough water for several months of drinking, and will be stocked with food for five months, as well as a shortwave radio to receive weather signals. Mr. Mortimer of the Sino-American Book Company also intends to make the trip, if circumstances permit. Last year, he purchased three Ningbo fishing sailboats in Haimen and sailed them to Shanghai, where they were completely refurbished. Originally, he intended to leave Shanghai last year, but the construction of new decks, installation of engines, etc., took longer than expected, so the departure had to be postponed to the spring. Now Mr. Anderson has chartered the ship, and if the trip is completed successfully, the ship will be placed on display at the San Francisco Exposition. Afterwards, Mr. Anderson plans to travel to New York via the Panama Canal. If possible, he will sail the ship from New York to Finland when the World Games are held.

### Rumored Puppet "Secretary-General" Su Xiwun Targeted in Assassination Attempt, One Shot Fired but Missed, Leading to Major Uproar in the Fake "Government"

In the puppet "city government" in Jiangwan, another shocking incident occurred yesterday morning at 11 o'clock. The puppet "Secretary-General" Su Xiwun was almost killed by a bullet. At that time, a gunshot was suddenly heard, and a bullet passed through the window next to the puppet "Secretary's Office" into the room, grazing the top of Su's head, only two or three inches away, and lodged in the wall. Su was extremely frightened and fell to the ground, but was not injured. The puppet officials in the room rushed out to investigate and saw three puppet "guards" with guns in their hands, seemingly cleaning them. After a while, Japanese puppet "police" gathered after hearing the alarm. The puppet "Guard Captain" Chen Jintao disarmed the three puppet "guards" and detained them together, investigating whether they had conspired to assassinate Su. The entire puppet "government" was thrown into a major uproar. Since the assassination of Fu Xiaoan last winter, this is the second terrorist incident. According to another report, the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" "Secretary-General" Su Xiwun was almost assassinated at his residence a few days ago. Afterwards, the puppet authorities were extremely secretive, unwilling to reveal such matters to the outside world. It is said that on the morning of the 5th, at about 10 o'clock, Su was about to leave his residence on Avenue Foch in Hongkou to go to the puppet "government" to work. Unexpectedly, when Su stepped out of the gate, one of Su's drivers drew a gun and fired a shot at him, but missed. The second shot failed to fire because the bullet jammed. Su, hearing the gunshot, was shocked and fell to the ground. The many bodyguards behind him immediately surrounded the driver and captured him. Afterwards, Su had the driver detained in the puppet "government" and is now undergoing severe interrogation.

### Gangsters Extort, Shoot Shop Owner, Rampant Robberies in Zikawei

In Zikawei, west of Shanghai, the Shengyongxing Rice Shop was broken into by armed robbers at 12 o'clock last night, and clothing and other items worth about 300 yuan were looted. Also, the Huahua Store in the West Market was invaded by more than a dozen bandits at midnight last night. They emptied the store of all its tinfoil, cigarettes, clothes, and bedding. The robbers, still unsatisfied, repeatedly beat the owner three times, eventually extorting jewelry and valuables worth several hundred yuan. The owner suffered serious injuries to his back and waist. Next to the Deji gambling den in East Town, a rice shop opened for business yesterday. At 2 p.m., a large group of gangsters demanded money for "opening expenses." The shop owner slightly offended them in his words, and they fired a shot, wounding him in the leg. Because the town currently has no administrative organization, these villains are allowed to run rampant. After negotiations, they were forced to extort more than 80 yuan in legal tender before the matter was settled. It is said that there are seven or eight gangs of bandits gathered in the town, especially the followers of the Jiangbei gang leaders Little Nanjing, Stone Lao, etc., whose power is even more rampant.

### Girl Kidnapped and Tortured, Woman Arrested and Interrogated, Further Investigation Required, Rescheduled for Further Hearing

Li Zuoheng, a 48-year-old vegetable vendor residing at 339 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, has a daughter named Li Aihua, 13 years old, who studies at the Dongxin Elementary School in the Yuli neighborhood. On January 5th, she was abducted from school and went missing. She was found on the 23rd of last month at No. 1 Annakin Court, Annakin Road. A report was made to the French Police, who found that the case was related to Li Wu, a fellow villager (27 years old) also known as Wu Ajin, residing at 29 Taihua Lane, North Jiangxi Road, and her lover Xie Runhui (25 years old, from Guangdong). Detectives were dispatched to arrest Wu and Xie and bring them to the Special Second Court for interrogation and investigation. On January 5th, at the school, a friend of the girl's father, whose name she did not know, went to the school and tricked her, saying that her father was buying vegetables on Vegetable Market Street and could not carry them back, and asked her to go help him carry them back. The girl believed him and followed him. She was taken to No. 29 Taihua Lane, North Jiangxi Road. After giving the girl a cup of tea, she became disoriented. She was then sent onto a ship to Songjiang, where she was sold to the Hong family for 100 yuan. Later, because a guerrilla force and the Japanese army fought in the area, the Hong family fled, abandoning the girl at home. The girl, terrified, climbed onto the drying platform and was spotted by a neighbor, who asked her and learned that she had been abducted and sold there. The neighbor took pity on her and took her in. Later, the neighbor came to Shanghai and brought the girl with her. At the dock, she told the girl to go home on her own. The girl, not knowing the way home and suffering from hunger and cold, wandered and got lost, reaching the entrance of the Southeast Lane on Dagu Road, with nowhere to stay. She cried at the entrance of the lane and was found by a police officer surnamed Li, who took her back to his home to be cared for. On March 23rd, Li's wife, Zhou, had the girl accompany her to the home of a relative at No. 1 Annakin Court, Annakin Road to stay there. The girl was playing in the alleyway of Annakin Court with a child in her arms when a rice seller, who knew the girl's father, passed by and spotted her. He told the girl's father, Li Zuoheng, who reported to the French Police. Detective Jiang Zhongjia was dispatched to bring Li and Zhou and the girl Li Aihua to the police station. After questioning, it was learned that Li Wu and Xie Runhui, the lovers residing in Taihua Lane, North Jiangxi Road, were involved in the abduction case. Li and Zhou had good intentions in taking care of the girl and were not involved in the case, so they were released. Li Wu and Xie were detained for investigation. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Liao in the First Criminal Court. Lawyer Yuan Shouxi, representing the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated that there was no evidence of involvement by the second defendant, Xie Runhui, and he would not be prosecuted. The first defendant, Li Wu, was charged with disrupting the family and luring a minor girl away from her family. When questioned, Li Wu absolutely denied knowing anything about the abduction and sale of the plaintiff's daughter. The court stated that the case required further investigation and ordered a rescheduled hearing on the 15th. Li Wu was remanded in custody, and Xie Runhui was released.

### Military Vehicle Overturns on Qinghu Road

When passing the No. 6 Bridge on Qinghu Road, west of Caohejing, one of the trucks overturned and fell into the river because the bridge had been sawed off by guerrillas, drowning three Japanese soldiers. The bullets and military supplies were lost and damages were extensive. The truck behind it, unable to brake in time, also overturned into the ditch. Many Japanese soldiers on the truck were injured. The Jiangnan Second Prison Garrison stationed in Caohejing learned of the incident and transported the injured soldiers to the Fenglinqiao hospital for treatment.

Xu Tingyu, the Nantong native factory manager of Shanghai Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, retained lawyers E Sen and Zhang Fayao in early summer of last year to file a suit with the Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, accusing Zhu Gengtao, the factory's manager, and Zhang Zixin of Xinchang Cotton Cloth Company of colluding to embezzle and misappropriate funds, requesting investigation and punishment according to the law, and attaching a civil suit to recover the misappropriated funds. Xie Keming, the former factory manager of Renfeng Factory, also retained lawyers E and Zhang to sue Zhu Gengtao for embezzlement and misappropriation. The defendants retained lawyers Xue Dubi, Ma Shouhua, and Zhang Deqin for their defense. The two cases were originally handled by Judge Wu Kechou and Criminal Court President Liao respectively. Later, to facilitate the trial, the court transferred the two cases to Judge Qiu Huanjing for consolidated hearing. After repeated court sessions, witnesses were summoned and questioned, and accountants were jointly appointed by the three parties to investigate the accounts. From the filing of the suit to the present, nearly a year has passed. The details of the trial have been reported in this newspaper many times.

### Someone Steals the Name of Patriotic Organizations, Extorting Money from Four Companies

The Social News Agency reports: Recently, in Shanghai, there have been unscrupulous individuals falsely using the names of patriotic organizations to forcibly extort money from people. These degenerates of the nation and the race are a hindrance to the reputation of our genuine patriotic organizations. For example, in the middle of last week, four major companies on Nanjing Road in this city suddenly received an official letter under the name of the "Second Division of the Chinese Youth Anti-Japanese Iron-Blooded Army," requesting subsidies from the four major companies. Although the companies were unwilling to reveal the wording of the letter, it is known that the content was clearly extortion under a false name. The letter also stated that they should contact a certain tycoon in this city. After investigation, the tycoon did not recognize the persons named in the letter, nor was there any contact. According to general speculation, this may be someone using this name to undermine the credibility of the national army, which is also within expectations.

Her life is in critical condition.

Shen Chuanyu, 46 years old, from Yangzhou, was a leatherworker. Recently, due to suffering from a chronic illness and being unable to afford treatment, he developed thoughts of death. Yesterday morning at 8 a.m., he went to the Suzhou Creek alone and jumped into the river in an attempt to commit suicide. A nearby Chinese police officer spotted him and quickly rescued him. He was taken to the hospital for treatment due to swallowing too much water and suffering serious injuries.

### Fire in Civilian Slum in Extra-Settlement Road Area on Rue Cardinal Mercier, Over Twenty Buildings Destroyed

The area near Shihailang Lane in the extra-settlement road area on Rue Cardinal Mercier in western Shanghai is mostly poor people's thatched houses.

### Full Text of the Resolutions of the Third National Education Conference (I): Proposals for Improving Educational Administration (Part 1)

— (Dispatch from Chongqing by Shen Bao Special Correspondent via Airmail)

(Shen Bao Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The Third National Education Conference, convened by the Ministry of Education from March 1st to 9th, had more than 300 proposals, printed into four large volumes, as thick as one and a half feet, which shows the richness of its content. Now, after half a month, the conference has sorted out all the resolutions passed at the meeting by category and formed various educational improvement programs. The reporter obtained them and reported them to the readers of this newspaper, so that colleagues in the education field can get a glimpse of the full picture of the resolutions of this conference and refer to them at any time, but those that cannot be published for the time being will be omitted.

Proposals for Improving Educational Administration:

(I) Regarding Revising the School System: After the school system was promulgated by the former Ministry of Education in November of the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), it was amended by the First National Education Conference in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), but it was not promulgated. Now, in reference to the current school laws and regulations and actual needs, the following points are proposed for revision: (1) Within the secondary education stage, in addition to the original 3-3 system middle school, a six-year middle school will be established, without distinguishing between junior and senior high school. (2) In addition to the affiliated simple normal department, the original 3-3 system junior high school may also have an affiliated simple vocational department, enrolling junior high school graduates. (3) Within the higher education stage, in addition to the original two-year and three-year vocational schools, a five-year vocational school will be established, enrolling junior high school graduates and students with equivalent academic ability to junior high school graduates.

(II) Regarding the Division of School Districts for Secondary and Higher Education:

(1) Each province should consider local transportation, population, economy, culture, and the distribution of existing secondary schools to divide the province into several middle school districts, several normal school districts, and several vocational school districts. (2) The number of secondary schools in each district of the province should be appropriately allocated. As a principle, each middle school district should have at least one middle school. Each normal school district should have one normal school or rural normal school and several simple normal schools or simple rural normal schools or simple normal departments, and should also establish a women's normal school or simple women's normal school, or establish a women's department in the normal school or simple normal school. Each vocational school district should have at least one vocational school or junior practical vocational school and several simple vocational departments. (3) The number of classes to be established in each type of secondary school, normal school, and vocational school in each district of the province, and the number of new students to be enrolled each year, should be planned and managed according to needs. (4) The central government should consider local transportation, population, economy, culture, and the distribution of existing vocational schools and above to divide the country into several normal college districts and several university districts. (5) The number of vocational schools and above in each district of the country should be appropriately allocated (not limited to one province as one district). Vocational schools should be affiliated with universities as much as possible, and various specialized departments should be increased. Each normal college district should have at least one independent normal college or a normal college within a university as a principle, and each university district should have one university as a principle. (6) The departments to be established in vocational schools and above in each district of the country, and the number of new students to be enrolled each year, should be planned and managed according to needs.

(III) Regarding the Qualifications for Educational Administrative Personnel:

The qualifications for educational administrative personnel at all levels should be based on educational knowledge and experience. The central government should separately formulate and promulgate regulations on the appointment of educational administrative personnel.

(IV) Regarding Educational Administrative Agencies Below the Provincial and Municipal Levels:

(1) The departments and offices and the number of staff members established by the educational administrative organs of each province and city shall be uniformly stipulated by the Ministry of Education. In provinces and cities with more abundant educational funds, special departments should be set up by the education departments and bureaus to handle social education and physical education. (2) Each county education bureau or the education section of the county government should establish at least one staff member in charge of compulsory education and one staff member in charge of social education and physical education. (3) Each county district head, township head, and Lianbao (joint security) chief should be responsible for promoting educational administration. (This proposal is not finished.)

### Second Shanghai Battle Between Canada and China: Overwhelmed the Giants Last Night; Ordinary Skills Result in 33 to 17; Canadian Team Will Compete with the American Children Again at 7 PM Tonight

The Kobe Canadian-Chinese team, after arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, had a contest with the American Children team. At 8:30 last night, they competed again with the Western Youth Giant team at the Western Youth Gym. There were only about two hundred spectators. In the game against the American Children team the night before last, the Canadian-Chinese team's performance was unusually poor, presumably due to the fatigue of the journey. Last night's performance seemed to have returned to normal, but the mediocrity of their skills cannot be denied. The Giant team's fatal weakness lies in their inability to shoot accurately. Individually speaking, Haiggett of the Canadian-Chinese team is quite nimble, and J. Crockett is steady, but too dull, and the rest are mediocre. Ai Liqu of the Giant team is better, and the rest are also mediocre. The battle was uneventful and ended lightly. In conclusion, the Canadian-Chinese team defeated the Giant team 33 to 17. At 7 PM tonight, the Canadian team will compete with the American Children team for the second time at the school. The results of yesterday are as follows:

### Western Youth Volleyball Group A: Sea Youth vs. Today's Door Russian Overseas Chinese

Sea Youth has an extremely high record in Group A, and the call for the championship is particularly high. Even the defending champion Russian Army team was defeated. Their strength is indeed strong. In particular, Zheng Yiquan's smashing is almost always a sure point. Although Russian Overseas Chinese A is not weak, it may be difficult to win against them. The last game is also Group A: Paramount vs. Western Youth. Western Youth has the famous player Borokhokov, and has not lost since the start of the competition, and is at the top of the group with Sea Youth. Paramount's strength is mediocre, and it is difficult to expect victory. The order is as follows:

Western Youth vs. Key Team (Women) 7:15 PM

Russian Overseas Chinese vs. Sea Youth (Group A) 8:00 PM

### This Year's Davis Cup Tennis Tournament: China is Extremely Optimistic; Xu, Cai, and He Will Divide and Resist the Great Powers

External News: In this year's Davis Cup International Tennis Championship, Dongying (Japan) deliberately showed leisure and sent a team to join. China was unwilling to lag behind and also rose up to participate. The most gratifying thing is that the representatives are well-selected, and the team is composed of Xu Chengji, Cai Huiquan, and He Renxuan, who are currently studying in Europe and participated in Wimbledon last year. It is planned that Xu Chengji will take on the first singles, Cai Huiquan will be the second singles player, and He Renxuan will cooperate with Xu Chengji to form a doubles team. The strength is strong, and it can be said to be unprecedented for the Chinese tennis team. China has a bye in the first week, but in the second week, they will face France, which has new masters and the veteran Bouro Tola. If they can pass this difficult hurdle, they will play the third week and then enter the fourth week. Because they can last two weeks, they will inevitably meet England. Since Pan Lai switched to the professional world, England has lacked successors and its strength has declined. It is found that Xu Chengji of China defeated the British master Austin by a score of 2 to 1 in the final of the British Open Hard Court Tennis Championship. From this, it can be known that Xu can be expected to win if he meets Austin again. Also, Cai Huiquan has won various championships in England. If the two of them strive to win three games in the singles, then England will have to bow down to us, and the prestige of Chinese tennis will shake the world. The orders for the first and second weeks are translated as follows:

First Week's Order

Yugoslavia vs. Ireland

Romania vs. Hungary

Poland vs. Netherlands

Germany vs. Switzerland

Second Week's Order

Czechoslovakia vs. Norway

Belgium vs. India

Italy vs. Man Ergao

Yugoslavia or Ireland vs. Romania

Hungary

Poland or Netherlands vs. Germany or Switzerland

Sweden vs. Denmark

England vs. China or Germany

### In Memoriam

— Maolie

Except for longevity like that of Mr. Ma Xiangbo, which we should celebrate, others are unnecessary. As for general congratulations and condolences, I also think it's perfectly fine to wait until after the victory of the war of resistance to express these feelings of sorrow and joy. That's what I said yesterday. Today, I'll add one more sentence: Around this Qingming Festival, general memorials or sacrifices can also be omitted, for the same reason that there's no need to celebrate, congratulate, or offer condolences now.

However, today, thinking of this day, April 7th, we cannot but mourn. We cannot but mourn Dr. Liu Zhanen, who was assassinated by the enemy's dogs a year ago today, thus sacrificing his life! His death was entirely for the sake of the country and the nation, so even though we had no personal friendship with him, we have always commemorated him, and especially today, we want to mourn him. His admirable words and deeds, his warm heart and ancient ways, will forever be our model, and his unyielding spirit will shine forever in the history of the war of resistance.

Our mourning for him is certainly not for his personal benefit, nor is it a pity that his life was not long and he did not enjoy himself. He sought benevolence and obtained it, so why should he complain? What we consider regrettable is that he had not yet reached the age of eighty or ninety when he met with disaster, causing great loss to the nation. Regarding this point, we who are still alive should also think about it. How should we carry on in the future to complete his unfinished aspirations?

I say: If we will tread in Dr. Liu's footsteps and carry on, then we are truly mourning him, actively mourning him; otherwise, it is just the same as usual, a routine matter, and it would be better to omit it!

However, in order to mourn Dr. Liu, we cannot but pay attention to the behavior of the other side, as well as the security of Shanghai. We often hear that the other side is putting pressure on the concession authorities, using the excuse that patriotic elements are disturbing the concession, and making various demands on the concession authorities. But what about themselves? Secret nailing frames and tying up are unnecessary to mention, and in the areas they occupy by violence, it is even more chaotic, forming anarchy. The attack on Dr. Liu was one example of these facts, and the unsuccesful attack on Yang Zaisan yesterday can be regarded as the most recent example. These actions of theirs truly make people feel that this world is hopeless!

Now that Dr. Liu has been dead for a year, their dark methods in the concessions have only become more and more intense. I think the wise concession authorities will certainly not allow them to be so unbridled in the end without decisive sanctions!

### The Smile on a Rainy Day

— Kuangsha

The road was beaten into a mud dragon by the water, lying prostrate, crawling past the low eaves, extending to the end. The shadow of this reptile disappeared, revealing a wasteland—no, now it should be said to be a puddle. Some towering places have become small islands, and on the islands are built houses mixed with broken bricks and broken pieces of wood; a moldy and humid smell, mixed with the stench from the gutters, makes it hard to believe that life can reside here.

A shadowy and distressed face pressed into the sound of the rain, a pair of hopeful eyes slipped out of the broken eaves. He looked at the blurry footprints on the muddy road, believing that his older brother would run back from the muddy road.

If the weather was clear, he would also be a little hero, he could also roll around in the Suzhou River,捞些淌来的菜梗之类的东西；climb on the rafts to strip the bark off the tree bottoms, pick up foreign iron cans in the trash cans, and sneak through the barbed wire to pick up coal cinders. The rain trapped his little heart. His father was a rickshaw puller, and his mother? Where did she go? He heard that she went to work, but she had never come back. Anyway, he was done with his mother as soon as he was born, she never comforted him or held him. He and his older brother were a team, he couldn't do without his older brother.

He didn't know how much water was in the sky, the rain falling incessantly, as if to break the ground; the mud dragon was already immersed in the water, and the puddle was slowly rising to the edge of the hole.

Rain, rain, rain, mixed with the heavy sound of loaded trucks, rumbling past outside the barbed wire; the cargo loaded high seemed like a pair of majestic beasts, splashing the mud high.

He remembered these things very clearly: his older brother had the ability to run after the trucks, quickly poke a hole in the large bales loaded on the trucks, and quickly pull out a pile of cotton. The workers on the truck gave him a thumbs up and praised him:

"Good boy."

A pile of cotton was sold to the small shop for one cent, and if he had the chance, he could also earn a few cents.

When the patrolmen came, his older brother got whipped, and the cotton that he had earned with his life was confiscated.

"Brother, let's be patrolmen when we grow up."

"No!" His older brother was a little angry, "Who cares! We're going to do something else."

"We'll pull rickshaws, like Dad."

"I don't want to—I want to be a road builder, and build all the muddy roads well."

"Brother, I'll go too, we'll build all the roads well, and build this muddy dragon road especially well, as strong as iron, so we can walk on it easily."

A bare foot stepped on the mud dragon, leaving a mark, the mark was deep, powerful, and quickly advancing forward.

"Brother! Brother, you're back!"

Raindrops fell on his sparse hair.

### My Song

— Jinxi

From a sea to an island,

My worn-out clothes

And bare chest!

The breath of a wanderer

Is deeply dyed on my body.

I am not afraid of wind, not afraid of rain,

Not afraid of winter and cold frost and snow.

A burst of fire, a burst of thunder,

A burst of frenzy, a burst of yelling,

Burning in my heart;

Like burning,

I insist on loving those

Wandering, homeless,

Worried, poor,

Those given damage and humiliation by the enemy

The vast compatriots.

In the moonlit night, in the daytime,

I swear, I shout,

I am a friend of truth.

I am an enemy of robbers.

I am a wanderer, I am

A person who loves justice, loves the weak.

### Breaking the Prison

"Time" is like a stream, from which I tell of treacherous rapids, where chaotic rocks cut off the water flow. Thus, old dreams are separated from me. I forget the calm water waves, the peaceful shores, the green mountains on the river, and the tranquility of the docks. The roar of the rapids fills my ears. The cliffs rise thousands of feet, forming sheer walls that block the sunlight. All around is bleak. I am imprisoned in a dark, deep pool. From "yesterday," I still cling to the fading wave marks. I reach out with questioning hands: the dark, rapid stream firmly locks this small boat, gloomy, dark, and forever?

"There are no continuous rapids, no eternal dangers, no unending imprisonment." As if from the vastness of the towering mountains, someone's voice reminds me.

Wandering in an isolated realm, on a solitary island, six months of life in a watery region, like the setting sun fading into the sails at dusk. Riding in a small boat, stalled at the head of the rapids, rugged reefs, scattered like stars, cut off the old flowing water, causing me to lose warm memories. Even in these treacherous rapids, leisurely enjoyment is impossible. I feel the threat of dual locks—the imprisonment of time and space.

Silently and patiently, I watch the fallen leaves hiding in the soil, seeking warmth in the blankets. The distinct seasons tell me of changes. On withered branches, one or two new green shoots sprout. "It should be the spring of growth!" Bursting through the light cold lock, expanding the vitality of life. Spring, the season of growth, we can no longer silently hide, confined in prison, cramped under the yoke, enduring under tyranny, submitting to shackles, surrounded by traps, obeying the whip.

"Spring, the season of growth," every sinew coils like a silkworm crawling on a mulberry leaf. Gradually, I feel the necessity for the inner energy to erupt. Black wind, black mountains, black sky, surround me, circling with heat impossible. So, I will steer my small boat, break through these treacherous rapids, from the reefs, from the waterfalls, from the sobbing waves, from the monkey-crying shores.

Who can endure this! This cruel imprisonment? No freedom, no wandering, no crying or laughing, no sun, no warmth, no growth.

The wails of thousands of homes, the songs of barbarians in several places, the footprints of life, turning within a few square feet of earthen walls, so close and convenient to the edge of death. Ocher-robed, shaved-headed prisoners, locked by darkness and cold, their eyes dimmed by shame, their bodies abnormally numb. "Time" locks the old days, "time" also cuts off the distance.

Awakened dreams often cannot be trusted on the pillow. A sliver of spring light leaks through the line of sky between the stone walls. And so I remember: the light mist on the lake, the willow catkins in the riverside city, the deep flowers and trees of the Zen monastery, the "Grain Rain" in the mountains when picking tea...

As I yearn for the beauty of wandering, someone reminds me in my ear: "There are no continuous rapids, no eternal dangers, no unending imprisonment."

And so I—

Cross the treacherous rapids, cross the rushing water, cross the deep pools. Black wind, black mountains, black sky, brush past my ears, receding behind me. I try to move a step to change shape, and I suddenly see green shadows and rosy clouds, morning breeze and rising sun.

### Afterthoughts

— Editor

Today is the first anniversary of Dr. Liu Zhan'en's death. I think all of Shanghai, no, all of China, is mourning him. We have two commemorative pieces here, one written by his student, which shows even more of Dr. Liu's greatness.

This publication does not publish works that envision or speak for the enemy, even if they are anti-war or depict their suffering. Please note this when submitting articles.

### Remembering Principal Liu Zhan'en

— Lin Dezhao

Today is the first anniversary of Principal Liu's death.

Although his physical body suffered the most despicable and brutal attack, his lifelong virtues and great spirit remain forever in our world. We often remember his words and deeds, taking them as a guiding light to examine and encourage ourselves.

Although our 'big family's' elder was murdered by the enemy, we, the tens of thousands of descendants and students, have not forgotten his profound teachings. He once said: 'Shanghai University is different from other schools. We are a "big family." I am the head of the family, and you are the children. I hope my children will have revolutionary ideas, disciplined behavior, and when facing the most difficult times, will not be afraid of difficulties, will not be懈怠, and will use a positive spirit to achieve all victories.'

He also said: 'One's outlook on life should be joyful; people should not be pessimistic. A pessimistic person is not only useless to himself but also an obstacle to the evolution of society. We must adhere to a revolutionary and disciplined life, unite as one, actively struggle, sacrifice the "small self" to achieve the "big self," serve society and the country, strive for the independence of the Chinese nation, international peace, and the happiness of mankind. Think big and start small in everything, breaking through this harsh and oppressive environment. We must do our best to exercise our bodies, pay attention to mental hygiene, and cultivate a physique and spirit that can withstand hardship.'

Regarding frugality and thrift, he believed that on occasions such as the 'September 18th' and 'January 28th' incidents, we must eat vegetarian food for one day and donate the money saved to the national salvation fund to relieve refugees and other charitable causes.

He advocated that we should go to the 'grassroots' and 'border areas' to serve, starting from nearby and extending to distant places, popularizing education so that out-of-school children, women, and adults can receive the minimum compulsory education.

We have not forgotten any of his teachings. Not only have we not forgotten, but we are also diligently carrying them out. We continue to establish civilian schools, vocational schools, and women's literacy schools, paying attention to raising the knowledge of the people and cultivating national concepts, so that everyone has a normal occupation, can serve society, and benefit the people.

Principal Liu, it has been a year since your death. Your personality is respected throughout the country. We hope that your spirit will always envelop your descendants and students, reminding us, as you did in life, to serve the country and society consistently, and to avenge you!

### The So-Called "Small Talk"

— Li Song

Mr. Du Chongyuan tasted the flavor of prison bars because of "small talk about the emperor," and Mr. Yi Junzu caused a great storm because of "small talk about Yangzhou." Although these two incidents each have their positive and negative sides, they are the same in that they arose from "small talk." Mr. Yi's "small talk about Yangzhou" did offend the people of Yangzhou, so it caused serious litigation. However, Mr. Du's "small talk about the emperor" was completely based on facts, but the "friendly nation" used the excuse of insulting ×× to make representations, and as a result, Mr. Du suffered imprisonment, and *New Life* was forced to cease publication. "Small talk" does indeed have spatial and temporal difficulties.

Occasionally, during leisure time, inviting two or three close friends to play chess or brew tea and chat with each other is a small pleasure. Now, it has changed. Everyone has no leisure, and no one can or wants to do this. In such an environment, even if there is leisure, it is difficult to have such interest.

In the past, in Shanghai teahouses and taverns, one could freely talk about "the Three Officials Scripture," whether about ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign affairs, without any consequences. Nowadays? There would be a notice saying "Gentlemen, please do not discuss current affairs." On the streets, it is best not to talk about national affairs or military situations, otherwise, some "disappearance" might occur.

Since the War of Resistance, there have indeed been many "small talkers" from the leisure class who have changed their usual bad habits and actually taken up the work they should be doing. They have run down from the teahouses and embarked on the road to national salvation. They have changed empty words into practical action. However, there are still some "gentlemen" who continue to criticize Zhang and discuss Li, their mouths full of national salvation and seeking relief, but the result is still a completely bystander attitude, unclear about the "spatio-temporality" of "small talk."

What is most heartbreaking is that before the war, the general ambitious and promising young people, he (or she) saw the environment becoming increasingly worse, and their will was depressed. Now, some of them have plates to lick and bowls to clean. Some spend their days in theaters, teahouses, or dance halls "talking idly." This not only deprives the work of resistance of many cadres but will also cause them to degenerate and harm society!

I believe that those who can talk cannot necessarily do, and those who can do do not necessarily have to talk. Acting before speaking is glorious, and speaking without acting is shameful. I hope that the general "small talkers" will no longer talk idly. "Small talk" in theaters, teahouses, or dance halls is the least instructive. I tell you: the current environment is different, and the times are different.

Spring and Autumn

### Talking about Mr. Ma Xiangbo

— Fo

I cannot help but feel that life is like a dream. Yesterday was Mr. Ma's 100th birthday. I should offer congratulations to Mr. Ma belatedly.

I once studied at Fudan Public School, which at that time was located in the governor-general's office in Wusong. The principal was Mr. Ma Xiangbo, and the academic dean was Mr. Li Denghui. Mr. Denghui had returned from abroad not long before, and was accustomed to English, while he was unskilled in Chinese. Therefore, several teachers teased him, saying that Chinese people should speak Chinese, and that anyone who inserted a foreign word into a conversation should be fined one dime. Mr. Li was repeatedly fined, and the teachers laughed heartily. At that time, I was nearly thirty years old, probably the oldest of the students, but I only studied for one semester because of economic pressure. Thus, I dropped out and took up the career of a journalist. Therefore, I dare not sever myself from Mr. Ma's students, nor dare I exclude myself from Mr. Ma's students.

I once heard Mr. Ma give a graduation speech to the students. He said that graduating from this school does not mean that your studies are complete, but only that your studies have begun, because there is no end to learning. Graduating is like getting a key to a bookcase. A key to a bookcase cannot be considered knowledge. Knowledge is still in the bookcase, and you must go and find the case, and research it yourself. Assuming you get the key but do not open the bookcase to study, then learning is learning, and graduation is graduation, and they are absolutely unrelated. This argument, for the average college student, who becomes arrogant and thinks he is the best in the world after obtaining a diploma, is truly a penetrating argument.

My father once taught me Mr. Ma's speaking method. He said that acting and speaking must not be separated, and if they are separated, it cannot be considered a speech. If you can only speak but not act, then no matter how pleasing your speech is, standing stiffly on the stage will certainly not evoke the sympathy of the audience. If you can only act but not speak, then you are just a stage performer, merely eliciting a laugh from the audience. He also said that the most complicated action in a speech is placing the hands. Putting them in front is not good, and putting them in the back is also not good. You must be like the conductor of an orchestra, raising and lowering your hands with varying speed, each in harmony with the musical notes, only then will it be appropriate. But standing and giving a speech makes it difficult to place your hands, and sitting and giving a speech makes it even more difficult to drop your hands. Therefore, a speaker must have true knowledge and natural posture, and the absence of either is unacceptable.

In the late Guangxu period (or in the early Xuantong period), the Shanghai newspapers held a tea party at Zhang's Weiyun Garden, inviting Little Liansheng to perform and Mr. Ma Xiangbo to speak. Those invited at that time also included Mr. Wang Jingfang and the old-fashioned traitor Zheng Xiaoxu, among others. Mr. Ma stepped onto the stage, placed one hand behind him, and pointed to the northeast, saying, "I see a dark cloud far away." This dark cloud referred to the Qing government. At that time, anti-Manchu sentiment was extremely intense, and the Qing government also persecuted party members very severely, but Mr. Ma openly made anti-Manchu remarks, and everyone deeply admired him. Although I cannot remember the rest of Mr. Ma's speech, judging from his words and actions and facial expressions, he could make the audience happy, he could make the audience angry, he could make the audience applaud and shout, or silently shed tears. His persuasive power was like this. Little Liansheng performed a play called "Martyr Pan Dives into the Sea." Little Liansheng disguised himself as a foreign student and gave a passionate speech. The audience applauded. Therefore, at that time, there was a saying that Little Liansheng acted like a speaker, and Ma Xiangbo spoke like an actor.

I have heard many speeches, but none like Mr. Ma Xiangbo's. Some can act but cannot speak, some can speak but cannot act, and some can neither act nor speak. For example, Mr. Yan Youling from Houguan, his knowledge was profound, and his insights were broad, which goes without saying, but listening to his speech made people feel drowsy. Even the old-fashioned traitor Zheng Xiaoxu stuttered, almost making people cover their ears and run away. But listening to Ma Xiangbo's speech made people forget the taste of meat with joy. Mr. Ma's knowledge was broad and profound, and although I could not see the bottom of it, I once heard him say to the students, "You can't even remember twenty or so English words every day." I (Mr. Ma referring to himself) used to have to read one or two hundred new words every day, and I could do it with ease. Although this seems like an exaggeration, it is not impossible for Mr. Ma to be proficient in Latin, so English would be easy to understand. Therefore, Mr. Ma was not only a great educator of his time but also a great speaker of his time, truly unparalleled.

Now, talking about Mr. Ma Xiangbo, I am reminded of my impressions of Mr. Ma's words and demeanor thirty years ago, which are still vivid in my mind, so I write this in a rambling manner.

### Written on the First Anniversary of Mr. Liu Zhan'en's Death

— Nai Yi

Time flies; it has been a year since Mr. Liu Zhan'en passed away.

Mr. Liu's death by shooting by thugs symbolized the shadow of the destruction of Chinese intellectuals in the "isolated island." Chinese intellectuals will never succumb to violence. There are many examples of this in history, and in the year since Mr. Liu's death, the intellectuals of the "isolated island" have responded to it with ironclad facts.

Naturally, Mr. Liu's death, in terms of his individual self, was also a great loss to the motherland's war of resistance and to the development and promotion of the cultural movement of the "isolated island." The frequent disturbances of public security in the concessions, and the excuses repeatedly put forward by the Japanese in their attempts to control the concessions, the so-called activities of "terrorists," are not difficult to discern from this. We believe that there may be several assassination cases in the concessions that were carried out by our enthusiastic elements, but the killing of these shameless traitors will not all be the result of these elements. It is possible that there was internal strife among the traitors over the distribution of spoils, or "when the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked." Another kind of terror, coming from north of the bridge, is aimed at our intellectuals, such as the death of Mr. Liu Zhan'en.

And if we recall who was the originator of the terror case, who was the one who posted the "look, look, look" announcement, and who was the one who sent the arms and poisoned fruit, it is not difficult to understand.

We are very concerned about the security of the concessions and support the neutral attitude of the concessions. Therefore, we believe that the concession authorities should thoroughly eradicate the source of the terror cases. Otherwise, carving a sword to find its source will be in vain, and the dangers that threaten the security of the concessions will inevitably increase day by day. The disaster of the smoke and gambling is a case in point of spreading from the areas where roads are built beyond the boundaries into the concessions.

And how should we commemorate Mr. Liu? Empty words are unnecessary. Sincere mourning and lamentation are certainly unavoidable, but these should be placed second. The best commemoration is action, especially now that the final victory is getting closer and closer, and the enemy's ferocity is bound to increase day by day. We should reflect on ourselves and see: in this year, how much work have we done that can comfort Mr. Liu in the afterlife, and that can be worthy of our own country?

### "Little Devils" in the Northwest: They Work as Buglers, Messengers, Cooks, and General Laborers

— Translated by Kamon from *The China Weekly Review*

More than 20,000 homeless Chinese refugee children, from all parts of China, have joined the Eighth Route Army in the Northwest to fight against Japan. Most of these children are between eleven and sixteen years of age, and therefore too young to wield military weapons, but they work as buglers, messengers, cooks, actors, and general laborers. These children are generally called "little devils." In every camp, they are the happiest. They wear motley abandoned military uniforms, often patched in three styles, and receive the same rations as regular soldiers—one yuan in legal tender per month. One sun-tanned child said that being a "little devil" is much more interesting than being a starving ghost in the fields in the Japanese-occupied areas. He left his hometown at the age of twelve and joined the army led by General Zhu De. Now this child is considered very important by the general public, because he is the only one allowed to stand guard at the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army. Few of these children have received an education, but after joining the Eighth Route Army, they receive literacy education every morning.

They are known for their ability to endure hardship. A fourteen-year-old child followed a team of mounted officers and walked forty-three miles in one day. By nine o'clock in the evening, the camp was set up, and he was still chirping like a squirrel, preparing beds for the officers.

Every evening, these children sit together and sincerely discuss the various issues of military science or political science that they have heard from the teachers during the day.

In every camp, the "little devils" have their own military organization and elect their own officers. They swear to abide by a code of honor similar to that of the Boy Scouts of America.

Hundreds of children, who had joined the Red Army long ago during the civil war, are now officers in the Eighth Route Army. After military training, the "little devils" are the most trustworthy quality in the fighting force. For this reason, commanding officers often choose their own guards from among them.

In addition to the "little devils," there are thousands of Chinese youths in the Eighth Route Army, both male and female, recruited from middle schools and vocational schools throughout the country. Now, they are working in various relief efforts behind the Chinese defense lines. On the battlefield, from the front lines to the rear, hundreds of service stations have been set up. These young people are all members of the Three Principles of the People Youth League. The service stations are equipped with medical supplies, books, magazines, factories, pots, utensils, a small amount of rice, and boiling water. Many of the young people working in the service stations admit that they ran away from home in order to do their part for the war. (Omitted below)

### After Watching "Sweethearts"

— Bai Hua

"Sweethearts" Produced by MGM

When you see the love between Taylor Power and Annabella interfered with by the company authorities, don't you express great indignation? Really, in Hollywood, after an actor dedicates himself to the screen, it is more for the "company" than for "art." When you have not yet become famous, the authorities will desperately create opportunities for you. Your every move, whether you like to eat sardines, wear green clothes, or even a inexplicable romance, is excellent publicity material. However, once you become famous, your contract will include conditions such as "not allowed to marry within a few years." The love between Taylor Power and Annabella is interfered with by the company authorities. If this news is not counter-propaganda, can you say there is any other reason besides "for the company"?

Therefore, I think the writer of "Sweethearts" is quite naive and lovely. He tells us this story: "A playwright on Broadway broke up a pair of lovebirds for a special relationship. His plan was to make a wife believe that her husband was in love with their female secretary. He sent someone to steal the love letters the husband wrote to the wife and put them into the play, making the wife believe that the husband also wrote a similar letter to the female secretary." The so-called "special relationship" is also that there is a conflict of interest with the producer of this couple. However, the playwright also showed his cleverness. This couple is a famous Broadway stage star, and because of the Hollywood movie company's invitation, this plan was devised to prevent them from going to Hollywood. But because of the playwright's cleverness, he also told us that there is a dark struggle between Hollywood and Broadway for hiring famous actors.

"Sweethearts" is the first color film by Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. Because it is a color film, the director, Mr. Van Dyke, has exhausted his ability to be gorgeous, rich, elegant, harmonious in costumes, backgrounds, and props. Such as the three-act opera at the beginning, the pastoral beauty of the Dutch folk song in the first act; the vivid and dazzling "Fate of Love" in the second act; the harmonious beauty of "Sweethearts" in the third act, not only this, but in each act, the director is very cautious in the color coordination. Jeanette MacDonald wore a brightly colored shirt in the dressing room, and when she put on makeup in front of the mirror, the color not only showed MacDonald's beauty even more, but also felt very comfortable when watching it. There is also MacDonald's fashion show, which really introduced Hollywood's popular new clothes, but isn't it showing the function of color films?

Have you seen "Marie Antoinette"? Were you moved by Van Dyke's outstanding skills? (It is writing about the life of Marie Antoinette, not writing about the history of the French Revolution) But "Sweethearts" is a comedy. It is the opposite of that kind of profound and moving delicate portrayal. The whole film develops in a light and cheerful melody, all the way to the end. What I especially like is the scene where MacDonald listens to the playwright's new script: when the couple is getting ready to leave, they are disrupted by the appearance of this playwright. This scene uses music to set off MacDonald's psychological state, which is very lovely, especially the knitting together.

Don't you like Roland Young in "Topper," then, Franklin Pangborn, who plays the producer, Phipps Lehman, is also equally lovable.

### 雨過天青

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Seven: A Pair of Swallows and Orioles Weaving a Brocade of Yue and Wu

What Mr. He said in his letter, what is called "raw goods" and what is called "processed goods"? Originally, agricultural products that have not been processed into anything are called raw goods. People have always thought that China is an agricultural country, a producer of raw materials, and that what it produces is all raw goods. For example, raw silk, although it is a major export of China, and it goes through many procedures from silkworm rearing to silk reeling, with specialized research and scientific inventions. However, when it comes down to it, it still belongs to raw goods. It must be dyed into various colors and woven into various silks before it can be considered processed goods. The difference between an industrial country and an agricultural country is that one produces processed goods and the other produces raw goods. Now, the new China is in the process of gradually transitioning from an agricultural country to an industrial country. Therefore, Mr. He wrote to the two young ladies, starting a silk weaving factory to sell abroad, which is an effort towards processed goods. The two young ladies were also very excited after receiving the letter from their old master. They were originally hesitant about the future of their careers, but now Mr. He's letter seemed to be leading them on a path. When they were at home in Guangdong, they didn't feel anything, drifting along. Almost two years have passed since they returned to China. Although they talked about seeking employment, because they were young ladies of the bourgeoisie, it seemed that they were used to being rich and honored. Now that they have arrived in Anle Town, they see that everyone is busy with their careers, without a day to spare. And the two of them are idle and have nothing to do, seeming to be embarrassed by what the ancients said, "eating their fill all day long, without using their minds." A person, whether male or female, cannot rely on the legacy of their ancestors and a few stinky copper coins to live a life of ease. If that's the case, why did we study abroad? And why did we learn about industry? The two of them were originally lamenting to themselves, and discussing it privately, feeling that being idle and doing nothing would be talked about and ridiculed. Today, upon receiving this letter, they thought that Zhu Airen was a good friend and they must tell him. Moreover, if they were to set up a factory, it would have to be located between the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, perhaps it would be appropriate to find a site here, and especially they must discuss it with Airen and ask him for help. That night, the He sisters talked to Zhu Airen about this. Airen smiled and said, "If you want to set up a hospital, then I can offer you many ideas. But now you want to set up a textile factory, I don't know anything about it, isn't that like asking a blind man for directions? But I have a wish, I hope your future textile factory will be located here. Not Anle Town, but Freedom Village would be best." (80)

### Our Country's Overseas Chinese Beauty Star, Miss Huang Ying, Returns Home for the First Time

— (Wang Kun)

Injured Her Knee When Boarding a Ship in San Francisco, Now Recuperating at Home in Hong Kong

Miss Huang Ying (Wong Ying), the younger sister of Anna May Wong, played an important female role in the film "Eskimo." Although her reputation and status are not as high as her sister's, she also has a considerable reputation. She recently returned to her ancestral country from the United States by ship with two relatives, to visit her family in Hong Kong, which attracted the attention of movie fans in Hong Kong.

On the day she boarded the ship in San Francisco, she accidentally injured her knee. By the time she arrived in Hong Kong, her knee injury had not yet fully recovered, so she had to stay in her cabin all the way, feeling that this trip was unfavorable.

According to her conversation with Western reporters in Hong Kong, when she starred in "Eskimo," she lived in the cold Arctic of North America, Alaska, for a full eight months. During this period, although she fell into ice holes several times, she was not injured. She also encountered a man-eating bear, but she was not harmed in the slightest. But this time, on a very new-fashioned mail ship, before the ship had even moved, she lost her footing while walking on the gangway, slipped down four steps, and her knee was injured as a result. She really considers herself unfortunate. She is now recuperating at home in Hong Kong, so she is not receiving many guests.

She also said that many Chinese film workers in Hollywood have been concerned about the situation of the war of resistance in their ancestral country. Whenever they encounter film footage of the war sent from China, when they are being developed in the darkroom, it is always crowded with these people who care about the war of resistance in their ancestral country. Although this behavior is prohibited by the company authorities, they also hold the enthusiasm of sympathizing with China and "being the first to see it," so they are very forgiving.

Ms. Huang Ying has participated in filming in various film companies in Hollywood for nearly ten years, just like her sister. The state of California in the United States is her birthplace. Her father is now seventy-eight years old, and her ancestral home is Guangdong. This is the first time she has returned to her ancestral country in her life. Unfortunately, her ancestral country is now suffering misfortune, which must be very disappointing in Ms. Huang's heart.

Anecdotes of the Qing Palace

### Shou'an Palace Stage

— Chan Weng

Among the theater stages in the abdicated Qing Dynasty palace, the one in the Summer Palace is the most magnificent. The Shou'an Palace stage described in this article is also of considerable scale. This stage was built in the 25th year of Qianlong, during the heyday of the Qing Dynasty, and was specially built for the 70th birthday of the Empress Dowager.

This stage is located behind the Cining Palace on the outer west road of the Forbidden City. It is the former site of the Xian'an Palace. In the 16th year of Qianlong, it was renamed "Shou'an Palace." There is a hall in the palace called "Chunxi," and the stage is behind the hall. The stage has three levels, with three bays on each side, a dressing building with five bays, and two corner buildings on the east and west sides with thirty-two bays. This is a rough description of its architecture.

The stage has three levels, with a caisson in the middle, and three plaques, reading "Qingxiao Shaohu," "Zengcheng Guangyue," and "Kunjiān Hengchun." There are three couplets, saying, "Phoenix radiance presents auspiciousness to the A Pavilion, pearls unite and scenery depicts the symbol of the peaceful steps," "Diagrams and domains iteratively evolve accumulated calculations, rhythms and rules cyclically generate harmony above and below," "The singing of Yu and the chanting of Yun celebrate the gathering of nine comforts, opening the longevity domain, the congratulations are presented and the dances of blessings are joined, weaving the myriad images of the spring terrace." The couplets and plaques are all from the imperial brush of Emperor Gaozong.

The construction cost of this stage, as seen in the records of the Imperial Household Department, roughly stated: "Oil painting, colored painting, papering, transporting slag soil, pulling and transporting materials and other projects, except for vermilion, ramie cloth, fir wood, copper tin, gauze silk, and Korean paper, which are obtained from the relevant departments for application, all the purchase of wood, stone, brick, lime, glazed tile materials, red soil rope hemp, nail iron miscellaneous materials, and the payment of wages to various craftsmen, total about 85,394 taels, 8 mace, 8 fen, and 5 li of silver. Excluding the original labor and the demolition of old wood, stone, bricks, and glazed tiles, which offset 9,837 taels, 3 mace, 5 fen, and 8 li of silver, the net need is 75,557 taels, 5 mace, 2 fen, and 7 li of silver."

It is said that the time of the construction of this stage is now 180 years ago. It is not only a relic of the Qing Palace, but also related to the historical facts of Peking Opera.

### Snippets from the Film World

Zhou Jianyun is planning to resume business of the Star Company in Hong Kong, intending to set up a main factory in Kowloon, with funds loaned by a certain bank. Directors and actors have already been hired.

Gong Qiuxia's performance in "Song of Tears" is exceptionally successful, and her singing is also very beautiful. It is expected that this film will be released to great acclaim for Ms. Gong. Also, Guohua Company regards "Song of Tears" as an unprecedented masterpiece, and the price for selling the film is extremely high.

Fang Peilin's "Incarnation Girl" three episodes will be completed by the end of April.

Among the records recorded by Pathé after the war, "Spring Breeze Wild Grass" has the largest sales volume.

Zhang Shichuan is very busy preparing to film "Li San Niang," and filming began on April 5th.

Li Hong and Jin Yan, who co-starred in "Lin Chong," often speak English at the filming location, which is quite noticeable.

Cai Chusheng and Fei Mu will join the Hong Kong factory of the Star Company.

Yi Hua has decided to carefully select the role of Wang Baochuan. It is rumored that Hu Die has sent a letter agreeing to star in the role, but she must go to Hong Kong to film it.

Gu Lanjun originally planned to get married after autumn, but suddenly her father passed away, so she had to postpone it. Who is the groom? Definitely not the one reported in the newspapers.

Wang Xianzai has been appointed as the protagonist of "Golden and Silver World." His new wife, Yuan Zhuru, is heavily pregnant. Wang has been living alone for nearly ten years, so it is no wonder that his first shot was a success.

### Secret History of the Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (139)

— Xu Muyun

Right Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Ming Dynasty Actually Judges Yuan Dynasty Grievances

I often say that Peking Opera is really too pitiful! If we want to examine it carefully, we can know that many of its scripts are translated from Kunqu Opera, Qinqiang Opera, and Han Opera. When they were translated in the past, they could still retain their original appearance, with not much difference. Except for the differences in music, singing style, and drama lyrics, as for the plot and the sequence of dynasties, there would never be any mistakes. However, when the actors of later years translated the plays, I don't know why, they often messed up the original plot. Sometimes, they even brought out people from hundreds of years later and forced them to hear a folk grievance. Not only is it not appropriate to put Zhang San's hat on Li Si's head, but also this kind of despicable act of plundering the beauty of others, I think Song Dynasty's Ju Xiaosu and Ming Dynasty's Hai Ruxian (named Rui, self-styled Gangfeng Mr.) would not want to do it either. Now there is a very popular Dan (female role) play that has this problem. If we don't correct it, I'm afraid it will get worse and worse. If the film company, because of the strong appeal of this play, also shoots it into a movie like "Mulan Joins the Army" and "King of Chu," and even transports it abroad for screening, then this face will be greatly lost. Because European and American drama artists pay the most attention to investigating the era of the script, and if we Chinese don't even know the dynasty of a play, wouldn't that be a big joke? Therefore, I have specially written out this popular play and pointed out its errors, to discuss with the drama comrades, hoping that everyone will not have any scruples because it is the play that made a certain famous actor famous. You should know that our deep research is all for the improvement of the entire drama, this is the real care for drama art.

"Snow in June," also known as "Lamb Tripe Soup," and also known as "The Golden Lock Record," I have seen a certain famous Dan actor perform this play several times. Its description roughly says "During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty (the calendar is mistaken for history), Cai Changzong, the son of Cai Yu Shi, married Dou E, the daughter of Dou Shangshu, as his wife, and used the remaining lock as a fixed gift, so it is called the Remaining Lock Record. It was originally a Kunqu Opera adapted into a Luan Tan (Luan Tan is another name for Peking Opera). In this play, Cai Changzong left home to take the exam, and was pushed into the Huai River by his servant Zhang Lver on the way. The old lady Cai heard the news and mourned painfully. While sick, she wanted to eat lamb tripe soup. Zhang Lver poisoned it in the lamb tripe soup, but Mrs. Cai did not eat it, and Zhang Lver's mother, Zhang Mama, ate it and died of poisoning. Zhang Lver wanted to take Dou E as his wife and tried to defraud her by using the dead body. He dragged Mrs. Cai to the court. Unable to withstand the torture, Dou E pleaded guilty for her aunt and was sentenced to be beheaded. Because of her filial piety, the heavens were moved, so it snowed in June. The circuit judge Hai Rui exonerated her grievances, the Lver brother was executed, Dou E was commended, Cai Changzong was rescued, passed the imperial examination, and returned home to be reunited."

### "Yang Guifei" Worried About Being Overweight, Hu Die Vigorously Carries Out Weight Loss Techniques

— Silver Thread

About to Start Filming, Currently Busy Taking Medicine and Injections

Ms. Hu Die, after returning from her tour of Europe, has been increasingly gaining weight, and her slender figure is gradually becoming bloated, which is quite detrimental to her beauty. She often frowns in front of the mirror, considering it a major concern. At that time, for this reason, she sought medical treatment and vigorously sought to lose weight. She once gave up nourishing foods containing meat and stopped eating rice, instead using bread, vegetables, and fruits to fill her stomach. After several months of diligent and unremitting efforts, it was indeed somewhat effective. Later, she suddenly fell ill due to a miscarriage, and stayed in the hospital for a long time, focusing on treatment. She often took a lot of milk and other supplements every day. By the time her illness was cured and she recovered her health, not only was all her previous work wasted, but she also gained more weight. Therefore, she spent a lot of effort, but in the end, she could not help but see it all go to waste. After that, she also practiced exercise diligently as a way to lose weight, and even made it a regular lesson, which was easier to persist in. In addition to opening a tennis court in the open space in front of her residence on Jiaozhou Road, and using it as a pastime with her "husband" Mr. Pan every day in a "husband and wife sing and follow" manner, she also hired a boxing coach, and diligently engaged in "Twelve Tan Legs" practice every morning. Ms. Hu's "arduous efforts", although she has not seen any great effect, in reality she has maintained her original state, and has not seen any more "daily progress" phenomenon, and she also feels deeply gratified. However, after moving to Xiangdao (Hong Kong) after the war and living a very leisurely "public lodging" life for a long time, her beautiful face became increasingly plump, and she gained a lot more weight than before. Xinhua Company invited her to star in the hard-dressed film "Yang Guifei." It was originally scheduled to be filmed in Hong Kong long ago, but Zhang Shankun was too busy with business to separate himself, so it was delayed. Now it is decided that after passing the 13th birthday of the old man, he must lead the photography team to leave Shanghai and go south. Ms. Hu's performance in this film is originally suitable for both the person and the play, and it is enough to show the beauty of Huan Fei in a more lifelike way. She is careful and overly worried, and recently she has hired a doctor and is busy with injections and taking medicine, seeking to achieve rapid weight loss. In fact, Ms. Hu's style is still so beautiful now. Even if she plays other roles, she only needs to use proper makeup, and the audience will never really feel that she is "too fat" on the screen. Having a love of beauty is a characteristic of ordinary women, and Ms. Hu, who is known for her beauty, is even more so than others, almost treating it as her second life!

### Miscellaneous Radio Broadcasts of Ma Shou Ping's Plays

— Hai Sheng

The Peking Opera broadcast celebrating the 100th birthday of Mr. Ma Xiangbo was held at the Continental Radio Station the day before yesterday. From 12:00 noon, famous amateurs and famous actors gradually gathered at the radio station. Jiang Yiqiu, Wang Benshan, Sun Lanting, and Qi Jun were still in charge of reporting. In the afternoon, a total of stage performers Zhao Songqiao, Li Xuefang, Qian Lintong, Zhao Junyan, Shen Yanqin, Li Xiuying, etc., led by backstage manager Chen Yuelou and administrator Lu Wenyi, automatically reported to the radio station, which is commendable for their enthusiasm.

In the evening, Li Ziyang and I were in charge of receiving guests, so the famous actors from various stages and theaters came one after another. Zhou Xinfang, who rarely participates in broadcasts, also gracefully accompanied Gao Baisui. Many listeners asked him to sing the play "Wen Suchen." Baisui smiled and said, "Hasn't this play been sung for more than two months? Aren't you tired of listening?" Jiang Yiqiu's performance of this play is also very appealing.

One thing that everyone considered a pity was that Huang Guiqiu, the pillar of the Tianchan Stage, refused to participate because the letter he received mistakenly referred to him as a lady. For the sake of rescuing refugees, it seems that he shouldn't be so serious. Moreover, the advertisement in the newspaper referred to him as "Mr."

Only the movie stars Gu Meijun and Lanjun sisters participated. Lanjun gave a congratulatory speech and thanked the audience. Meijun sang a Qingyi excerpt from "Fenhe Bay." Chen Hefeng sang an excerpt from "Eight Hundred and Eighty Years." The famous amateur Wu Jiangfeng and the clown Han Jinkui sang "Hundred Longevity Pictures" together, which can be said to be good praises and blessings. Han Jinkui's "little dog" Xiao Kui sang an excerpt from "Imperial Fruit Garden." This child's performance has improved even more.

The enthusiastic charitable actors and performers broadcast live until more than 3:00 in the morning before dispersing. The results were very good. More than 300 yuan worth of longevity bowls and commemorative badges were bought by listeners who went to the radio station in person.

### Finance: Cash Before the Holiday Falls First and Then Rises; Only 250 Taels Traded in Half a Day

Yesterday, the Shanghai gold market only operated for half a day. Therefore, after discussion among the industry, it was decided to close the market for four and a half days, until next Tuesday, the 11th, when the market will open as usual. However, the situation yesterday morning was slightly volatile, generally falling first and then rising. Initially, due to the lingering weakness of the previous day, the fund houses were eager to sell, so the low was once seen at 2,060 yuan. Afterwards, because retail investors took advantage of the low price to rush to buy, it rebounded upwards. As a result, it fell by 1 yuan. The trading volume in half a day was mediocre. Gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged. Custom gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to rise slightly.

Yesterday's Shanghai Gold Dropped by 1 Yuan

Initially, the price of raw gold per bar (10 taels) was weak because a certain gold shop was eager to sell and buyers were not interested. Around 10:00, the securities firm bought 50 taels from the fund house at a price of 2,066.5 yuan, which was the opening price. After the opening, there were even fewer buyers. Until 11:00, a certain gold shop pressed the price and sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry at 60 yuan, which was the lowest price of the day. Afterwards, because buyers took advantage of the low price to rush to buy, but a certain gold shop had no positions to sell, so it rose back. The money exchange industry bought 50 taels from the silver shop at 65 yuan. Then, the gold shop bought 50 taels from the money exchange industry at 68 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. Since the afternoon was the Xia Li Qingming (Qingming Festival), and the industry was closed as usual, the transactions made in the afternoon had to be settled overnight. Because today's settlement coincides with the spring holiday, it was decided to close the market. According to the closing price of 2,068 yuan in the morning, it fell by 1 yuan compared to the previous closing. The difference for the whole day was 8 yuan. The selling price of the cash number's own brand was 2,065 yuan. The current bid gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there were no transactions.

Gold Jewelry Still at 210 Yuan

The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged. Da Tong Hang still suspended the original price of 210 yuan, Xin Tong Hang was 208 yuan, and the purchase price was 202 yuan.

Pure Gold Continued to Rise by Half a Penny

London, May 5th. British pure gold continued to rise by half a penny per ounce due to the continued weakness of the British pound, reaching £7 8s 6d, causing the purchase price of Chinese cash at the Sino-British Bank to also rise to 1,212.3 yuan. The listed price of custom gold was still 2.39 yuan per li. The price of Shanghai standard bid gold also rose by 4 jiao, totaling 1,207.6 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Very Stable

Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate fell by 0.0625. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were very active in settling payments. The supply from foreign banks was smooth, and the market price was as stable as before. The Shanghai gold market opened softly, and gold shops were selling heavily. Retail investors' absorption was weak, and the market was weak. Later, money exchange firms and Hong Kong firms took advantage of the low price to absorb, and gold shops' supply was not smooth. The market prices were stable. As a result, they fell slightly. There were no transactions in the afternoon. In the foreign market, British-American gold pounds were actively bought. Hong Kong ticket money exchange firms were actively selling, and the market was still stable, with only a few kinds rising and falling, and the changes were very narrow. The guild's transactions were still prosperous. Sen Tai sold 1,000 yuan of Hong Kong tickets to Tong Feng Jin, Qin Tai sold 50 pounds of British gold tickets to Yong Feng Jin, and Cheng Tai sold 100 Swiss francs to Tong Feng Jin. Yesterday's market prices: US dollar tickets fell by 3 li, Hong Kong tickets rose by 3 li, and Philippine tickets rose by 1 fen. The market will be closed for four days from tomorrow and will reopen next Tuesday.

### The Foreign Exchange Market is Slack, and Prices are Neither Good nor Bad

Yesterday, the exchange market was slack because the holidays were approaching, so the settlement of accounts by foreign firms was sparse, and foreign firms still had a lot of supply. Therefore, the situation was very peaceful and there were no changes, resulting in neither good nor bad prices. The transaction volume was also quite light. Although the Chinese banks' absorption of the Hong Kong exchange was very strong, the money exchange industry and foreign firms' supply intentions were not weak, so there was no difference.

In the early morning, London's large strips, both near and far, were even, and New York's silver prices remained fixed. London's raw gold was a half penny, the exchange rate of British to American was a small six hao, to French was a drop of four cents, and to Shanghai it was still even. The US to British dropped by 0.0625, to French shrank by 0.0625, and to Shanghai it did not move. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' morning selling prices were British exchange at 8 pence 25 and US exchange at 16.0625 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, there were neither good nor bad prices. After work, although foreign firms were actively purchasing, the Bank of England and HSBC's supply intentions were very good, so there was a lack of changes. Foreign firms settled and entered HSBC British exchange at 8 pence 25. HSBC's listing announcement did not move, and the announcement of the silver balance tax also had no rise or fall, still slightly at 4.50%. After that, foreign firms purchased and settled a certain bank's US exchange at 16.0625 yuan, and the reward was still quite stable. As it neared noon, the transactions became even sparser, with only slight buying and selling of Hong Kong exchange. Foreign banks sold Hong Kong exchange to Chinese banks at 55.875 yuan, and the potential trend was slightly hardening. By the time of the noon closing, the banks' selling prices for both British and American exchange were the same as the morning opening.

The afternoon became even more silent. There were no transactions for both British and American gold, and the prices remained stable. As for the Hong Kong exchange, there were few transactions, but the reward turned flat. The money exchange industry sold Hong Kong exchange to Chinese banks at 55.75 yuan. By the time of the evening closing, the banks' selling prices for British exchange at 8 pence 25 and US exchange at 16.0625 yuan. There was no difference in both British and American exchange compared to the previous closing, and there was also no rise or fall in Hong Kong exchange.

### British and Indian Silver are Both Calm

London, 5th. Citi merchants slightly settled transactions in the silver market, and later speculators came to sell slightly. The market was flat. After the closing, it continued to be flat. A small number were bought at the listed price, and sellers retained the large strips. Both near and far terms were unchanged. Also, New York reported that the price of US silver remained fixed. Also, Mumbai reported that the Indian silver market was calm. The spot price and April shrank by one anna, and May remained even.

### Discount Rate Suddenly Falls

At noon, it returned to 49.5 yuan. In the afternoon, it tended to be flat, half a yuan lower than the previous day.

US Dollar: 15.375 yuan
Shanghai Exchange Rate: 104 yuan

(Shanghai Exchange Rate: The amount Tianjin should receive for 100 yuan in Shanghai transactions)

### Securities: Interest on British and French Bonds Not Yet Paid; Domestic Bonds Stable

In the over-the-counter securities market, yesterday's half-day trading, followed by a four-day holiday (resuming business as usual from the 11th), led to some covering of short positions, and the market price was slightly firm. Trading volume was relatively low, and the environment remained unchanged. European issues are still brewing, and there are still many difficulties with the reopening of the exchange. The blockade of Ningbo port has caused anxiety, leading many parties to sell. These positions must withstand a four-day market closure, so there may be changes. Therefore, both long and short positions were settled, stabilizing the market. Yesterday, the market rose at the opening due to retail investors covering short positions. Songmao, Xieda No. 14, and Dafeng and other firms had some selling activity. On the selling side, Renchangfeng, Dalianhe, and other firms offered slightly more. The market was extremely flat. In the afternoon, preparations were made for same-day delivery, and the market closed for half a day. Market prices ultimately closed slightly firmer by one to two jiao. The total trading volume was approximately 300,000 yuan. A summary table is provided below:

Category   Highest    Lowest    Closing   Compared to Previous Day
Unified A 57.50 57.40 57.40 Up 0.10
Unified B 51.65 51.55 51.60 Up 0.15
Unified C 51.25 51.00 51.20 Up 0.20
Unified D 50.20 —— 50.20 Up 0.15
Unified E 51.25 50.05 50.25 Up 0.15
96 6.55     Flat

In stock trading, 50 shares of British-American Tobacco Company stock were traded at a price of 6.625 yuan, slightly firmer than before.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported on the stock market on the 6th, stating that the four-day Spring Festival holiday starting this afternoon should theoretically impact the market. However, activity remained quite high today, and buying sentiment was strong. Tram stocks rose to 40.5 yuan, and public bus stocks continued to rise to 27 yuan. Jardine Matheson's shares in Wheelock Marden and other large companies were also traded. Jardine Matheson shares were strongly sought after throughout the day, with the closing offer reaching 20.02 yuan. Plantation shares, which had been stagnant for weeks, saw more demand today. Previous rumors of a ban on transferring North China paper currency to Shanghai have gradually dissipated. Rubber shares showed slight activity, but prices remained low. According to reliable news from London and New York, raw rubber materials are currently subject to a 50% production limit, and spot prices have tightened sharply. Raw materials can be sold smoothly everywhere. Once the situation in Europe improves, the rubber market will likely rise. Conversely, if the international situation deteriorates slightly, hindering sales, the market will experience drastic changes.

London Chinese Foreign Currency Bonds, market prices on May 5th (Wednesday): The Anglo-German Extended Loan and Anglo-French bonds continued to fall by £2, priced at £68.5. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway bonds also decreased by 5 shillings, priced at £19.5. The remainder were unchanged. Furthermore, regarding the interest coupons for the current term of the British and French loans, the Ministry of Finance's spokesperson had stated that funds had been secured and could be paid on time. However, the payment deadline passed today without payment. Nevertheless, market prices remained stable and have not declined.

Another report: The British and French loan guaranteed by customs duties was issued on August 18, 1908, with a total loan amount of £5 million and an original term of 30 years, to be fully repaid by 1938. Last year, due to the impact of the war, only the interest was paid on October 5th, while the final principal payment of £250,000 was postponed. Regarding the 61st installment of interest due on April 5th this year, the Ministry of Finance had stated that the funds had been transferred to the paying agency and could be paid on schedule. However, according to a telegram received yesterday from London dated the 5th, the market price was the same as the 4th at £60, without any indication of "ex-interest" (historically, market prices after interest payments on April 5th were marked "ex-interest"). (Y)

London British Far East Companies' Stocks, market prices on May 5th (Wednesday): Bank stocks continued to weaken. Mercantile Bank shares fell by 7 shillings and 6 pence, priced at £8. Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corporation's London-registered shares fell back by £1.5, priced at £83. Hong Kong-registered shares fell by £0.5, priced at £85. The remainder were unchanged.

### Ningbo Cargo Ships Stagnant, Cotton Yarn Transport Line Not Affected, Shenxin Factory Releases 5,400 Bales of Scheduled Yarn

The yarn market is showing signs of recovery, but actual demand is weaker than the previous day. Rumors of a self-imposed blockade of the Ningbo River once made people uneasy and caused a decline. Market discussions indicate that Zhejiang Province has long ceased to purchase cotton yarn, so the suspension of that transportation line will not significantly affect the yarn market. Instead, yarn is being transported via the Youtou inland river to Jiangxi and other places for sale. Additionally, although demand from Hong Kong, Yunnan, and Chaozhou is not exceptionally strong, purchases have been particularly active recently. As a result, the market has recovered. However, news that the Shenxin Factory had released a large quantity of approximately 6,000 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn caused sentiment to relax, and the market appeared flat. Merchants will close for four days from tomorrow, the 7th, to the 10th, for what is commonly called Foreign Qingming.

Regarding the current yarn situation, colleagues gathered at the beginning of the morning, and although Ningbo merchant ships were suspended, Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants had long since stopped using this route for their cargo, so people remained calm as usual, and it can be said that the market was absolutely unaffected. Therefore, the opening price rose by 2.25 yuan, with 20-count Double Horse yarn priced at 387.25 yuan. Fellow merchants were buying, and shortly after, Hong Kong merchants continued to purchase, further supporting the market. The highest price reached 389.5 yuan. Later, news of a potential sale by the Shenxin Factory caused sentiment to slightly ease, and the price retreated by 1.5 yuan. The market was flat in the afternoon, and trading was even more sluggish due to the Spring Festival holiday. Statistics show that a total of 855 bales were purchased by various merchants throughout the day, with prices generally unchanged from the previous day. The Shenxin Factory released 20-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 385 yuan, making up for the previous sale at 395 yuan, and 390 yuan was the ordinary opening price, totaling 5,200 bales. Additionally, 200 bales of 32-count Double Horse single yarn were released at a price of 532 yuan, for delivery in April and May, with a deposit of 40 yuan per bale. Fellow merchants took the majority, with fewer customer purchases. Today, 1,400 pieces of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, 290 pieces to Hong Kong, 45 pieces to Tianjin, and 115 pieces to Yantai. The amounts purchased by each merchant are listed below:

(Hong Kong) 270 Fellow Merchants 480
Yunnan 10 Shantou 55
Total 855

The Japanese yarn market continued to advance, with rising momentum. The sharp rise in prices on the Qingdao Exchange boosted sentiment and fueled buying. At the same time, business in the guerrilla zones has been active recently, driving up the market. Next month's prices are expected to be even higher due to a large number of short positions. The spot price for 20-count Water Moon yarn is 355 yuan, and the spot price for 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 349 yuan, a sharp increase of 3-4 yuan compared to the previous day.

### US Cotton Subsidies to Be Announced Soon; Some Supplemental Purchases of Foreign Cotton by Shenxin; Domestic Cotton Still Lacking Highlights

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was active due to high securities prices, and fellow merchants slightly increased purchases, with prices rising by 3-4 points. The so-called Polk-Hague Act, passed by the House of Representatives on Monday, was rejected by Congress (this newspaper had anticipated that this act would not be implemented). Congress is now planning a better solution, with the main points being largely similar to subsidies, and it will be announced soon. Yesterday, Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 1.5 rupees, while Egyptian cotton fell by more than 20 points. Converted to legal tender cotton prices, American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 0.2 yuan per dan, Indian cotton rose by 0.4 yuan, and Egyptian cotton fell by 1.6 yuan.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading: The previous day's slight increase in yarn prices prompted the Shenxin Factory to release more than 4,000 bales of cotton yarn, so they slightly increased purchases of raw cotton by several thousand bales. Due to the blockade of Zhenhai, the export of Yao cotton has been greatly affected. Yesterday, Rongfeng imported 2,000 bales of Pingguo cotton as a substitute for Yao cotton, with the price delivered to the factory being only 56 yuan, including water and rebates, making it much cheaper than Yao cotton. The delivered-to-factory prices for foreign cotton futures yesterday are listed below:

Raw Material Category Delivered to Factory (Including Tax)
60-count Egyptian Cotton, Premium 100.45
Same, Medium 100.55
80-count, Premium
Same, Medium 28.00
20-count American Mitter Cotton 83.10
Same, Lower Grade 69.95
32-count, Same 91.80
Same, Lower Grade 80.90
42-count, Same 93.00
Same, Lower Grade 81.85
South American Brazilian Cotton, Premium 87.40
Same, Medium 84.10
Same, Lower Grade 74.55
10-count Indian Pingguo 62.15
16-count Indian Omera 64.75
24-count Indian White Rock 79.90
32-count American Xin 85.05
22-count, 42-count American Pengaipu 89.50

Business in domestic cotton remains scarce, with only white, clean cotton being purchased for delivery to factories, but the quantities are still minimal. However, market inventories are also low, so market conditions are unusually stable. High-quality Haitipu cotton with good stems is still selling at high prices and is not loosening. Overall, there are no highlights in the cotton market, and there is unlikely to be any major change. It cannot rise too much, nor can it easily fall, and it is in a state of confusion. Sources from northern Jiangsu are becoming more accessible, with 1,247 bales arriving at the wharf from Tongxian, and 1,840 pieces of Yao cotton being transported from Ningdu yesterday. The current selling prices for spot cotton are listed below:

Tongzhou Cotton 77.00-77.60 Yuanxing Dejin 1,100 bales Delivered to warehouse by remittance
Same 77.40 Xiehehao Jin 1,100 bales Same
Haitipu 72.25 Xinyihao Jin 1,100 bales Cash only
Huoji Cotton 72.00 Fellow Merchants 100 bales Same

### Piece Goods: Eastern Piece Goods More Expensive Than Chinese Factory Cloth; Prices of All Goods Expected to Rise After Spring Holiday

National cloth: Eastern piece goods rose again yesterday, while the price of national white cloth rose negligibly, resulting in a situation where eastern piece goods are more expensive than national cloth. The price difference is widening, attracting purchasing interest from this street and the guerrilla zones of Wuhu and other places. More than 200 pieces of coarse fabric were traded in detail, and fine twill for dyeing purposes was particularly popular, with more than 400 pieces traded. Fellow merchants are also becoming more active, ordering more than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill from factories for this month. Printing and dyeing factories have huge demand for patterned cloth, sateen, yarn, serge, and flannel blanks. They are willing to accept orders for both near and long-term delivery, but most are still in negotiations due to difficulty in agreeing on prices. Yesterday, the price of white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill rose by approximately 0.1 yuan per piece, while the price of coarse cloth remained unchanged. The cost of bleached and dyed cloth has increased too much, and sales were halted yesterday. Prices of all goods are expected to officially increase after the Spring Festival holiday. Demand from Sichuan and Guangdong merchants has decreased because factories are unwilling to accept pre-orders at the original price. Merchants from Taizhou have been unable to purchase goods since the blockade of Haimen, and are now transiting goods via Wenzhou, purchasing 50 pieces of fine and coarse cloth.

Eastern cloth: The prices of fine cloth and fine twill are rising more and more sharply. Yesterday, the price of fine cloth jumped another 0.3 yuan per piece. This is because demand from Tianjin and Qingdao in the north is strong, with nearly 2,000 pieces of various brands being purchased yesterday. At the same time, sentiment on this street is also becoming increasingly high, and the market is becoming more tense. This mutual push and pull led to more than 1,000 pieces being traded. Fellow merchant firms are placing nearly 2,000 pieces of fine cloth orders with various foreign firms, with Longtou fine cloth accounting for the largest share. The market is expected to continue to rise.

Piece goods exports: 325 pieces shipped to Shantou on the 7th, 200 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Yarn Raincoat Cloth Soars

Raincoat cloth made by Tui Kai Shui Mi is the best, especially the old brand 4026, because it does not harden. Therefore, its price is also high. Yesterday, the wholesale price was 8.6 yuan per yard. Ordinary British-made non-genuine 4026 is being sold for 8.45 yuan per yard. Because of its high price, those with weak financial resources are using double-sided yarn raincoat cloth, which is not Western goods. Especially large wholesale clothing vendors are relying on this. Its price is only over 1 yuan per yard. Currently, this yarn-faced raincoat cloth is in great shortage, and the market has suddenly soared. Every yard must be sold for 2.25 yuan. If only 1.75 yuan is earned, now they are all being sold for 2.5 yuan. According to a survey by the Bank of China, no shipments of various colors of non-Western raincoat cloth have arrived this spring. Because of this, Chinese people are studying how to imitate it.

### Silk and Tea: New Atmosphere in the Silk Market, Both Domestic and Foreign Sales Are Smooth

Yesterday, the New York silk market continued to rise. The near-term price rose by 0.03 yuan, and the long-term price rose by 0.025 yuan. The spot price of Japanese silk rose by 0.02 yuan, and Shanghai silk 0.07-0.08 yuan and Guangdong silk rose by 0.03 yuan each. The Lyon market opened, and the spot price in Yokohama rose by 5 yuan, and the long-term price rose by 17 yuan. The overseas atmosphere is also steadily rising.

In the local silk market, there were many responses to the telegram sent the day before. Silk sales to British, French and American merchants continued to progress. The white factory 7-8 grade price opened at 1,600 yuan, and Jardine Matheson and Dachang jointly imported more than 100 dan. French silk with no average B-grade was sold for 1,580 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. Renchang and other firms imported 40 dan. Silk from Ji Li was traded by six firms, including Qilin, Racecourse, M蟒蛇, and Fierce Horse, for 60 dan, at a stable price. Yesterday, user silk was also affected by foreign sales, with 20 dan traded. Overall, yesterday's market was characterized by stable prices and strong sales, a new atmosphere after being manipulated by speculators for a long time.

Today is the Foreign Qingming Festival, and there will be a four-day holiday as usual. Business will resume on the 11th, and the silk market is expected to be even stronger after reopening.

20 pieces of tea will be shipped to Qingdao on the 7th.

### Grain: Business in Local Flour Not Active, Newly Arrived American Flour Being Peddled in the Market

Factory flour: The current flour market is stagnant. The No. 2 flour factory's price and local merchants all continue to maintain the original price of 4.4 yuan. However, business is not as active as the previous two days. This is because banks are closing for four days for the Tomb Sweeping Festival, and buyers and sellers have not been able to enjoy themselves. Both northern and southern merchants are only making token transactions. Only local retail sales are still not deserted. The total turnover of local merchants is each estimated to be more than 10,000 bags. Market development may have to wait until the reopening of business.

Today, 19,500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin, 13,500 bags to Yantai, 4,000 bags to Quanzhou, and 1,000 bags to Shantou. There were also 1,000 bags of bran shipped to Shantou.

Foreign flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market was also in a stalemate. The price of Australian flour futures was not drawn, and the price of Qizhi flour futures was slightly lower, at approximately 2.4 yuan in US dollars per barrel. The new American flour that recently arrived from foreign firms such as Shunquan and Long were as many as 260,000 bags and have already being peddled on the market. Such as Dengjie, Magic Brand, and Cai Dao Brand, etc. The selling price is 4.12 or 4.30 yuan in cash per bag, and various fees are added separately, but local merchants are not particularly interested. The seller also plans to wait for the reopening of business before selling. Therefore, there are only scattered store sales. The market is also expected to be stagnant for a few days due to the bank closure. There are three days of spring holidays starting tomorrow.

Wheat: The market situation has stopped trading because yesterday was the Qingming Festival. Only miscellaneous grain markets were closed. However, today, 310 sentences of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong and 20,000 pieces of soybean cakes were shipped to Xinghua.

### Rice Market Hovering

Yesterday, various merchants' sources and He Xia共到八號, Che Lun Baozi, 苏同帮, and 昆山太平乔帮 arrived with more than 2,500 bags, and 龙虎塘 arrived with 125 bags. Store demand on this street was average, and囤户 rarely asked about it. The old warehouse still had strong holdings due to the small number of arrivals. The market showed extreme stagnation. Except for 高料包子 goods, the prices of 粳价 did not rise or fall, and the prices of the middle section and 河下货 have already fallen by a few 分 to 角 許. In short, this kind of market is unpredictable, forming a hovering situation. The prices of 杜洋尖 and 埠尖 were average, and they also lacked buying and selling activities.

### Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Up 0.1 Yuan

Yesterday's market for refined white sugar was tighter. Taikoo B brand's price drawing on the Shanghai Merchants Association, delivered at the west warehouse, quoted 25.4 yuan; delivered at the warehouse, 25.3 yuan; 24th grade coarse granular white delivered at the Puxi Wharf, 25.35 yuan; more than one hundred bags were traded; transit goods, 17.1 yuan, two bags. Regarding domestic sugar, only the Chaozhou merchants slightly offered full-grade top-quality ice white at 24 yuan, second-grade ice flower white at 21.5 yuan, ordinary Huanggang green at 14.2 yuan; a total of more than one hundred bags were traded. Because there are no deliveries, the markets of 刁糖 are difficult to revive, but a recent report from a customer letter stated that although the production price has slightly loosened, the price is still needed about 14 yuan, so the prices of brand-name goods cannot be sold immediately.

### North-South Goods: Jianqu Production Prices Rising

The production price of red koji from Fuzhou has already risen by 5-6 yuan before and after, and the cost of drawing a bill of exchange is also becoming more expensive. Therefore, the market price here has also risen accordingly. For example, top-grade transparent red koji is being sold for 58-60 yuan, upper-middle grade 45-46 yuan, ordinary grade 38-42 yuan.

### Hainan Dried Longan Trading Scant

There are few deliveries of Hainan dried longan, and the market price is also weak, so merchants are willing to raise the price to more than 60 yuan, but now the rate is only scattered. Although the cost is high, it is difficult to fulfill that wish. It is said that a dozen pieces were traded, and the price was 59.5 yuan.

### More Than 400 Barrels of New Galvanized Iron Sheets Secured

Merchants from Tianjin and tea merchants purchased galvanized iron sheets yesterday. Because the existing inventory is unusually thin, the opening price has a slight upward trend. For example, No. 2 is sold at 245 yuan per barrel (tea merchants have the widest demand), No. 3 is sold at 240 yuan per barrel, No. 4 is 140 yuan, No. 5 is 230 yuan, No. 6 is 210 yuan, No. 7 is 195 yuan, No. 8 is 210 yuan, and Nos. 9 and 10 are 230 yuan. Tianjin merchants are placing orders for all colors, and the printing house alone needs No. 8. However, there is a great lack of overseas goods, so the factory has secured them from overseas. It is found that more than 400 barrels were secured yesterday. The price was initially £23 per ton, but the final price was set at £22.10.

### The Market for Narrow Strip Steel Is Quite Good

Narrow strip steel sales, nineteen are for the cigarette factories and can factories. At present, the selling prices are excellent, such as 46 yuan per case of 200 pounds of American narrow strip steel (3 inches or less), 48 yuan per 200 pounds for 3 to 5.6 inches, and 50 yuan for 6 to 8 inches (all American goods). This product is extremely scarce, so the market conditions are good.

### Coal: Lump Coal Steady

Since the beginning of spring, lump coal has been as mediocre as ever, and there are ample stockpiles. Local sales have been somewhat inferior due to competition from falling prices of coal briquettes. Daily turnover is about one to two hundred tons. The wholesale price for merchants is as follows: First grade, No. 2 small chunks 36 yuan, delivered to the store, plus delivery charge. For door-to-door delivery, the first grade is 2.2 yuan per dan, and the second grade is 2 yuan.

### Kailuan Coal Demand Becomes Smoother

Since Kailuan bituminous coal's price increase last month, merchants have taken a wait-and-see attitude. Recently, because factories and firms all have needs, the market has stabilized. Merchants at the market traded 500 to 600 tons. The price is at the yard: Kailuan No. 1 lumps 40 yuan per ton, No. 2 lumps 38 yuan. For door-to-door delivery, add 2 yuan to the price, with a large piece selling for 5.25 yuan.

### Imports and Exports: An Abundance of Goods from Ningbo

--It is feared that these will disappear after this--

There were quite a few imports to Shanghai on the 6th. There were 1,000 pieces of cotton cake from Ningbo, 780 pieces of bitumen, 1,200 pieces of bitumen from Wenzhou, 346 pieces of tobacco from Ningbo, 65 pieces from Wenzhou, 2,845 pieces of fresh eggs from Ningbo, 1,410 pieces from Wenzhou, 1,200 pieces from Xingang, 1,300 pieces and 150 pieces from Ningbo.

### Native Paper and Wood Boards Come Streaming In

On the 5th, 11,670 pieces of paper were shipped from Shantou, and 790 pieces of native paper and 4,375 pieces of wood boards came from Wenzhou. On the 6th, 4,280 pieces of native paper came from Wenzhou, and 1,300 pieces from Ningbo.

### Medicinal Materials: Cinnabar Prices Rise Frequently

Among the fine materials of Chinese medicine, cinnabar is produced in Changde, Hunan. Its function is to calm the nerves and relieve fright, so its sales are very wide. Before the Shanghai War, the selling price was only 5-6 yuan per catty. After the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, supplies were interrupted, and the selling price rose to 10 yuan per catty. By the end of last year, it continued to rise to 15-16 yuan. Cinnabar is also an important item in military supplies. It is currently forbidden to export from the local area, so shipments are even rarer. Recently, the inventory is also low, so the selling price has also soared, and is now 56 yuan per catty.

Chinese Medicine and Diet

### Seasonal Vegetables: Wolfberry Shoots

— Zhang Huailin

"In the second month, spring bamboo shoots and wolfberry shoots are both excellent dishes. Although wolfberry shoots are slightly bitter, this does not detract from their quality. Wolfberry shoots not only taste good, but also have great benefits. The wolfberry fruit used in medicine is the wolfberry berry, and the root bark of the wolfberry is the root bark, which functions to clear fire and nourish the liver.

The effects of wolfberry are great, and the use of wolfberry shoots is also many. In the south, wolfberry is a vine-like shrub three to four feet long. In the Ningxia area of Gansu, it grows into a large tree, no less than towering pines and cypresses. Therefore, the wolfberry shoots eaten in the north are like the Toona sinensis shoots we eat, and they can only be picked for a few days a year to supplement meals, and you will miss the opportunity in the blink of an eye. The wolfberry in the south is short and the climate is mild, so wolfberry shoots can be picked for about thirty-four days. When picking, you must choose the newly sprouted tender buds, which are plump and strong. Pluck off a shoot that looks like a flower stamen, about half an inch long. After picking thirty or forty of these, and adding two or three inches of tender spring bamboo shoots, you can make a delicious and palatable dish.

Wolfberry shoots are also known as Tianjing grass and have the same effects as wolfberry berries. They can clear and resolve heat toxins in the blood and reduce the occurrence of sores and boils."

### Measles, Shortness of Breath, and Nasal Flaring: Causes and Dietary Care

— You Xuezhou

The exchange of air is the process of expelling the old and taking in the new, commonly known as breathing. Adults typically breathe 16 to 18 times per minute, while children breathe approximately 30 times per minute. Except in cases of extreme slowness or rapidity, the breathing rate is usually not closely monitored for diagnostic purposes, nor is there generally a need to do so. In general medical practice, unless the case is a severe and dangerous illness, doctors rarely count the breathing rate.

One symptom is often triggered by a cold and coincides with respiratory diseases, thus most easily affecting breathing. If children with measles have a fever that is too high, it often leads to weakening of the heart. Blood cannot fully enter the lungs, carbon dioxide in the blood increases, the respiratory center is abnormally stimulated, and the breathing rate increases, even exceeding 40 times per minute, resulting in shortness of breath. At the same time, the nostrils also flare.

Besides high fever, the main causes of shortness of breath and nasal flaring are tracheitis or pneumonia. Children with measles often cough frequently, and the trachea is already inflamed. In severe cases, this develops into tracheitis or pneumonia. The inflammation increases the amount of phlegm, which either fills the trachea or leaves no space in the alveoli. With the respiratory passages blocked, the amount of air inhaled into the lungs is reduced, and the level of carbon dioxide in the blood increases, leading to shortness of breath and nasal flaring. Shortness of breath and nasal flaring in children with measles are very dangerous signs. Immediate medical attention and medication are necessary. Neglecting it even briefly can lead to convulsions or suffocation, rendering the condition incurable.

As for diet, it is difficult to consider when the condition is severe and critical because the patient's appetite has already stopped. Since the patient does not want to eat, and such dangerous shortness of breath and nasal flaring cannot be eliminated by diet alone, the relationship between diet and shortness of breath and nasal flaring is rarely discussed. To my knowledge, the stomach and lungs are located close to each other. When the symptoms of shortness of breath and nasal flaring are not yet severe and the appetite has not declined, it is best not to eat too much, to avoid stomach expansion that would compress the lungs and hinder breathing. Observe how, after excessive eating, one often feels a fullness and discomfort in the chest, making breathing difficult. This is the evidence. In the early stages of measles, cold foods are generally contraindicated, but there are exceptions. If the fever is very high and the measles rash does not appear easily, there is often shortness of breath. If the tongue coating is white, the treatment involves using ephedra and gypsum as the main ingredients. If the tongue is smooth and red, the treatment involves using fresh rehmannia and fermented soybeans as the main ingredients. While using medication that includes cooling ingredients, one should also adjust the diet accordingly. If the fever is very high, it is acceptable to use cooling drinks in moderation, such as water chestnut soup, orange juice, and sugar cane juice. However, it is essential to stop at the right amount and avoid excessive consumption. If the fever is high but not extremely intense, cool foods and drinks can be slightly warmed before consumption, which reduces potential harm. Once the measles rash has fully emerged or is starting to fade, but the fever has not yet subsided, and the shortness of breath is due to the high fever, the tongue will definitely be red. Medication should then consist of large doses of sweet and cold yin-nourishing herbs, such as fresh rehmannia, fresh dendrobium, ophiopogon, and reed root. In this case, orange juice and sugar cane juice can be given freely to nourish yin and clear heat, without needing to soothe qi and open the lungs. The shortness of breath will subside on its own. If the high fever persists for a long time and the heart has weakened, the focus of medication should be on strengthening the heart with aconite, black lead pills, and the like. If the patient can eat, they should eat small amounts of bland, light-tasting foods. Phlegm obstructing the throat, add bamboo sap and fresh ginger juice to the medicine and administer it, allowing it to slowly flow down and be discharged through the stool. For excessive phlegm and shortness of breath, juice grapes and administer the warm juice. These methods can also be used for emergency relief when a sudden change occurs in a stable condition.

### Leguminous Foods

— Ding Lixiu

There are many types of beans, each with different functions. A brief description follows:

Yellow Soybeans: Tonify the center and resolve toxins. Best cooked, as stir-frying can cause bloating. Sprouted and rooted, they make excellent vegetables. Raw, they are not fishy and are very effective for lung itch, boils, and measles rash.

Green Soybeans: Clear the liver and nourish the stomach. When tender, they can be shelled and used as a side dish, which is very palatable. Boiled in salt water and dried, they can be stored for a long time and transported far.

Black Soybeans: Tonify the spleen and kidneys, expel wind-evil, and effectively resolve various toxins. The skin can be used medicinally to stop night sweats. Prepared soybeans (大豆黃卷), made from black soybeans, treat damp bi syndrome and eliminate water retention.

Red Beans: Promote water circulation and reduce swelling, useful for beriberi. The smaller, darker red variety is used medicinally.

Mung Beans: Cooked, they clear the gallbladder, nourish the stomach, relieve summer heat, quench thirst, promote urination, and sober one up. Sprouted and rooted, they make excellent vegetables with a refreshing taste.

Peas: When tender, they can be shelled and used as vegetables, which are very palatable. Sprouted, they do not cause stagnation.

Hyacinth Beans: The white variety is best. Strengthen the spleen and stop diarrhea.

### Foods to Eat and Avoid During Pregnancy

— Zhang Ruwei

After a woman becomes pregnant, her diet requires special attention. Foods to eat include: in the first month of pregnancy, when there is a craving for sour soup, noodles are good. In the second month, when there is a craving for sweet foods, meat is good. In the third and fourth months, soft rice, vegetables, and fish soup are good. In the fifth and sixth months, rich foods, harmonizing the five flavors, are good, but avoid overeating. In the seventh and eighth months, regularly eat soy milk and tofu skin to moisten the internal organs and strengthen the bones. In the ninth and tenth months, the diet should be balanced, with occasional sweets to nourish the spleen and stomach. Foods to avoid include: glutinous rice, which causes worms in the child; dog meat, which causes the child to be mute; and rabbit meat, which causes the child to have a cleft lip. Other foods such as donkey meat, sparrow meat, crab, ginger, arrowheads, and scaleless fish should also be avoided. Various types of mushrooms can cause infantile convulsions. After becoming pregnant, do not take medicine indiscriminately, do not drink too much alcohol, do not lift heavy objects or climb to high places, do not overindulge in leisure and sleep, do not wear overly warm clothes, and do not overeat. These are all essential precautions.

### Introducing Ephedra Pear: Responding to the Anti-Spitting Campaign

— Fouming

Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, leading to a surge in colds. Coughs and colds are everywhere, and the habit of spitting indiscriminately is on the rise. The anti-spitting campaign initiated by informed individuals is certainly essential. However, if those suffering from colds and coughs can be cured early, the anti-spitting campaign will be more effective. Therefore, I would like to introduce the "Ephedra Pear" remedy:

Ingredients: One large pear, 2 fen of ephedra, 2 qian of Sichuan fritillary powder, 2 qian of rock sugar.

Preparation: First, wash the pear, cut off the top, and use a copper spoon or small knife to remove the core. Place the Sichuan fritillary powder and rock sugar inside. Then, replace the pear top and use ephedra sticks to secure it, joining the top and the pear together. Place the pear in a bowl and steam it in a rice steamer. Once steamed, remove the ephedra sticks. The juice and pear can both be eaten freely. The taste is very palatable, and even children will enjoy it.

Effects: Pear moistens the lungs, resolves phlegm, and reduces fire. Ephedra dispels wind, opens the lungs, and calms asthma. Sichuan fritillary powder opens the lungs, stops coughs, and transforms phlegm. White rock sugar moistens the lungs, generates fluids, and transforms phlegm. When combined, their effects are enhanced. It is very effective for colds and coughs without any adverse effects.

### What to Know About Diet After Illness

— Chen Zhongquan

Having read "Qing Bian for Prolonging Life," I found several sections on diet and recuperation after illness to be quite practical. I have transcribed them here for patients' reference:

(1) During typhoid and epidemic diseases, when the body is cool and the pulse is slow, vegetable soup is good to help expel lingering pathogens. If the abdomen feels comfortable, then clear rice soup made with aged rice can be given to stimulate the stomach's digestive function. After one or two days, a small amount of millet porridge can be given three to six times per day, but not too much. With proper soup, a recovery of one hundred days should be achieved without relapse due to food or overexertion.

(2) For all types of pain, avoid consuming pork fat, wet noodles, mutton, greasy foods, and fried foods, as they can cause relapse and make treatment difficult.

(3) After a stroke, avoid pork, mutton, goose, chicken, fish, taro, eggs, stagnant qi-inducing foods, and triggering foods.

(4) For consumptive coughs with fever, edema, and panting, eat a bland diet and avoid salty foods.

(5) After sores or dysentery, avoid overeating and consuming raw, cold, sweet, slippery, or blood-nourishing foods.

(6) After childbirth, women must avoid cold and cooling foods, even on the hottest days.

### Discussion on Diet (4)

— Qin Bowei

Twelve Porridges: Porridges are moistening and easy to digest, making them suitable for patients and those with weak spleen and stomachs. Typically, they are cooked with white japonica rice. During illness, the crust of the cooked rice is often used for its aromatic and non-stagnating qualities. However, for nourishing deficiencies after illness, glutinous rice is better, except for those with blockage in the middle jiao, as it is suitable for most conditions. It can also clear lingering heat in the lungs that other medications cannot clear. Therefore, after seasonal diseases, it is the best choice. Additionally, barley porridge can widen the middle and direct qi downward, while foxtail millet porridge can regulate and nourish the spleen and stomach, being suitable for most illnesses. To increase its tonifying power, lotus seed powder, gorgon fruit powder, or Chinese yam powder can be added to japonica rice porridge. These can benefit qi, strengthen the middle, secure essence, and stop chronic diarrhea. Alternatively, swallow's nest, sea cucumber, or juices from chicken, duck, beef, or lamb can be added to replenish deficiencies of yin and yang, essence, and blood. It has been said that some porridge sold in street stalls is mixed with a small amount of lime to make it sweet and sticky. However, this can be warming and drying, causing thirst and spitting. It is only suitable for those with cold phlegm-accumulation, abdominal distention, or a narrow abdomen, as it is similar to the "lime porridge" mentioned in books.

Thirteen: Cow's Milk: Cow's milk is rich in fats and proteins, making it an excellent source of nutrition. It is often used to nourish patients.

Fourteen: Bread and Oatmeal: Bread is made from wheat flour and yeast, making it light, easy to digest, and as nutritious as rice. It is a staple food in Europe and America. Recently, many Chinese people with gastrointestinal problems have also used it to satisfy hunger. Oatmeal is made from flattened oat grains with the bran intact and contains gluten. Gluten is a type of protein that makes up about 10% of wheat, so it also has nourishing effects. It is rarely harmful when cooked for patients. (End)

### Drinking Water and Taking a Walk After Meals

— Xu Xiangren

Food is the paramount concern of the people. Nothing in the world is as difficult as getting food. The primary goal of human life is, without a doubt, the issue of eating. However, I have some confusion. After meals, some people drink tea, some smoke, some drink coffee, some eat fruit, and some eat sweets. Is it because they feel that eating is insufficient and needs supplementation? Or do they feel that eating is useless and needs remedy? I believe that the benefits of those five activities do not match the benefits of drinking water and taking a walk. How much less can they compare to supplementation and remedy? Alas, how many people understand physiology and hygiene? They get used to something and don't examine it, and things continue to be this way.

### Aconite Stewed Beef

— Dong Shuliu

Aconite has a pungent, sweet, and very hot taste and nature. It warms the meridians, aids yang, dispels cold, and eliminates dampness. Beef has a sweet, warm, and mild taste and nature. It strengthens the spleen, boosts qi, warms the stomach, and regulates the middle jiao. The concentrated broth made from both ingredients has a pungent, sweet, and warming taste and nature, making it very suitable for patients with yang deficiency and cold in the stomach. Those with a history of yang deficiency and stomach cold are not suitable for tonifying plasters or pills during the winter months. Only aconite and beef cooked together can both tonify and invigorate yang, warm the middle jiao, and dispel cold. Trying it for one winter will eliminate cold limbs and cold body in the coming spring, and the appetite will also greatly increase. For this recipe, use 5 qian to 2 liang of aconite and an appropriate amount of beef. The aconite should be yellow and thick, as its taste and nature are milder than black aconite and does not cause blood stasis or promote heat. The beef should be yellow beef, as its tonifying power is greater than that of water buffalo and can also warm the middle and benefit qi.

### Organ Therapy Long-Invented in China (6)

— Xie Yenong

The effectiveness of turtle plastron glue for yang deficiency has been mentioned above. Now, I will briefly discuss the effectiveness of turtle plastron glue for yin deficiency. "Yin" is a general term for various fluids in the human body, including blood, semen, and secretions from the digestive organs such as gastric juice, intestinal juice, saliva, and mucus. Its function is to moisten the tissues of each section and part, assist digestion, and promote excretion. Therefore, yin fluids should always be abundant and full. Any deficiency will cause changes in the body. Overexertion, lack of moderation in sexual desire, or those who lean towards a life of the mind, with distorted thinking, excessive mental labor, lack of sleep, and various febrile diseases that burn and absorb water in the body, all can deplete body fluids. Symptoms include fatigue, emaciation, dizziness, tinnitus, flushing, irritability, insomnia, poor memory, and mild fever in the afternoon or evening. Turtle plastron glue is made by calcining turtle bone and boiling it in water. It nourishes yin fluids, promotes gastrointestinal secretions, benefits the kidneys, tonifies blood, and clears deficient heat. It can be effective for the above-mentioned symptoms, hemorrhoids, seminal emission, and uterine bleeding in women that result from yin deficiency. Three qian of turtle plastron glue can be used each time, with 2 liang of aged wine. Put it in a bowl and steam it until the glue melts. Add a pinch of white sugar and then pour boiling water over it. (End)
