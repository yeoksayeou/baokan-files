The Agenda of the Congress Has Not Been Announced

Chongqing. Many important issues are awaiting decision at the Sixth Plenary Session being held in Chongqing, among which the issue of establishing a constitutional government is particularly important. The agenda of the meeting has not been announced, but it is widely believed that the congress will first consider the recent suggestions passed by the National Political Council, especially the one on establishing a constitutional government as soon as possible. Chinese sources here state that a National Assembly must be established before the constitutional government is formed to discuss and pass the government's constitution. The Sixth Plenary Session is expected to decide on the date of the National Assembly's establishment and the procedures for electing representatives. The Sixth Plenary Session will also likely consider China's foreign relations in light of the European war. This point may not differ significantly from the Chinese government's established policy, which was reiterated by Chairman Chiang yesterday. It is expected that the Sixth Plenary Session will formally reaffirm China's determination to continue the war of resistance against Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Opening Address

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday). Furthermore, regarding what he calls "resolving the China Incident," he should thoroughly repent now that he realizes that China cannot be conquered and that the world is watching. He should completely abandon the "New Order in East Asia" and all that entails. However, his method of ending the incident is to establish a puppet central government, which not only thoroughly insults the Chinese nation but also insults all nations of the world. Everyone knows that what he calls resolving the China problem is actually to destroy China. What he calls wanting to compromise with other nations is actually to exclude other nations. This kind of behavior is simply self-deception and is getting worse and worse. For example, recently, within his own country, some people hope to appease the United States first, while others are dreaming of winning over Soviet Russia first. Because of this, he wants to appease both sides and threaten both sides, but in the end, he will inevitably fail completely. I once explained at the Fifth Plenary Session that the Japanese political strategy's failure is because "the foundation is wrong, so every detail is useless." It has been a year since he loudly promoted the "New Order in East Asia." Because of this big mistake, not only has his diplomacy failed, but his military and political aspects have also failed in every way. For ordinary people, they should turn back when they fail, but Japan will never reflect, never correct itself, so the more it fails, the more mistakes it will make, and the more mistakes it makes, the more it will inevitably fail. In the past nine months, his military, political, and diplomatic efforts have all been rapidly advancing on the road to failure. In short, the Japanese failure is incurable. Secondly, we must be confident in the correctness of our national policy of resistance and remain steadfast. Speaking of this, I want to remind all comrades of two things. The first thing is that this European war fortunately occurred after our resistance against Japan had already begun. The second thing is that we were fortunate to launch the resistance against Japan on July 7, two years before the European war broke out. The people of the whole country must understand that launching the war of resistance on July 7 two years ago was the most appropriate time, and our more than two years of struggle and sacrifice have had unparalleled value. Furthermore, we should look back at the national policy we have set since (September 18th). I explained in the four sessions of the National Political Council that our national policy is built on four principles: (1) Opposing Japanese aggression to protect the integrity of our sovereignty, territory, and administration; (2) Abiding by international treaties, especially the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact; (3) Not participating in the Anti-Comintern Pact; (4) Foreign policy is completely independent and autonomous, and not subject to any restrictions. We have adhered to these four principles unswervingly for eight years, and we will continue to fight based on this to achieve China's independence, freedom, and equality, and to lay the foundation for a nation based on the Three Principles of the People. What we should strive for in the future is simple and clear, and there is only one thing: as long as Japan does not realize its errors and the resistance war does not stop for one day. As long as we firmly and unswervingly resist to the end, no matter how the international situation changes, Japan will not be able to achieve any of its goals. Thirdly, we must trust our friendly nations, concentrate on resisting the war, and demonstrate China's ambition to save itself and the world, so as to contribute to world peace. We believe that due to the common psychology of peace-loving in the world, the European war will eventually be resolved rationally. Our resistance war began with resisting the aggression of power and will inevitably end with building lasting world peace. We can also assert that the observation of various countries on world issues may not be completely the same at present, but their observation of the Sino-Japanese issue and the overall situation in the Far East is consistent, because the success or failure of China's resistance war is actually consistent with the interests and safety of all friendly nations in the world. No country does not plan for the true interests of its own country, so I dare to assert that no country will compromise with a country that fundamentally conflicts with China at the expense of China. However, we Chinese do not have the slightest reliance on friendly nations. We only rely on justice and righteousness, and work together with friendly nations to achieve the goal of world peace. Therefore, we must not only fully trust the clear understanding of all friendly nations, but also firmly adhere to the maxim of self-help and being helped by others, and be absolutely self-reliant and strive to live up to the friendship of all friendly nations, and be worthy of the common responsibility of upholding justice, curbing power, and ensuring world peace. Fourthly, we must recognize that the enemy's creation of a puppet central regime is a further and final failure in his political strategy. If Japan had a clear understanding of the situation in the world and the Far East, as well as the revolutionary power of China's Three Principles of the People, and had no aggressive ambitions and did not violate international morality, it should know that China's independence and prosperity are the barrier to Japan's welfare. In short, as long as the Japanese side does not abandon its policy of invading the mainland and does not withdraw all its troops invading China, no matter what methods it uses, no matter what rumors it creates, the Sino-Japanese war will never end. As long as the Sino-Japanese war does not end, no matter what country, it will never compromise or understand with it. But on our side, precisely because we have a clear grasp of victory, precisely because the success or failure of today's resistance war affects the good and bad fortunes of the whole world, we must be even more cautious, even more vigilant, and even more vigorous, self-reliant, and tireless. I hope that everyone will concentrate their minds during this important plenary session, review the past, and whip themselves painfully, renew party affairs, improve politics, make military achievements even higher, so that the foundation of victory created by the sacrifice and struggle of officers and soldiers on the front line for more than two years can be fully harvested, so as to achieve the success of our resistance and nation-building, comfort the spirit of our Premier in heaven, comfort the martyrs who died for their country and performed their duties, and the general compatriots who are displaced and suffering.

A unit of more than 900 troops broke out of the city on the evening of the 12th and fled through Gaoloushang (northeast of the city), where they were ambushed by the Chinese army and suffered heavy losses. The remaining troops continued to flee to Gushanling. More than 1,000 Japanese troops from Fencheng advanced west to reinforce them, but were intercepted by the Chinese army in the area of Qianhou Yecun.

### Chongqing Newspapers Discuss China's Future

Chongqing. The newspapers here today unanimously praised Chairman Chiang's opening address to the Sixth Plenary Session, considering it an important document of historical significance. The Central Daily News praised China's ability to wage a long-term war of resistance under Chairman Chiang's leadership, despite many military disadvantages. Regarding China's future, the newspaper stated that, in terms of the Far East, the dark period has passed and dawn has arrived, as the Japanese aggressors are increasingly reaching their end. However, in Europe, a pessimistic atmosphere still pervades, and everything is still uncertain. Only China is still moving forward with a firm will and conviction. The Xinhua Daily, the organ of the Chinese Communist Party, stated that although the rumor offensive launched by the Japanese side and its puppets between the Fifth and Sixth Plenary Sessions has completely failed, the sharp friction within is indeed regrettable. Therefore, the most important mission of the Kuomintang's Sixth Plenary Session is how to promote cooperation and unity between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If the Kuomintang implements democratic politics with a firm and frank mind and recognizes the people's political rights, it will be a significant contribution to the country and the nation. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

Editorial

### Conjecture on the Future of the European War

Belgium and the Netherlands are calling for peace and mediating a ceasefire. Britain and France have already responded, stating that the key to establishing lasting peace lies with Germany. Germany has not yet responded and will likely declare that Germany has not declared war on Britain and France, and that the responsibility for destroying peace lies with Britain and France. They are shifting blame to each other and accusing each other, so a ceasefire and peace are at least hopeless at present. From now on, the expansion of the war's scope and the extension of the war's duration are inevitable.

From the start of the war until now, although Britain and France have been facing Germany on the Western Front for three months, it has been limited to small contacts and there has been no large-scale war. The means that both sides emphasize are not military offensives, but political and diplomatic offensives; the noise of broadcast propaganda is more than the noise of artillery shells; the waving and shouting of politicians is more than the charge and shout of soldiers; of course, this is not the true state of war, but a scene in the process. Originally, Germany's operational goal was Poland, and once Poland was obtained, its goal had been achieved. The ease with which Poland was attacked and the speed with which it was captured were long expected by Germany, so it did not hesitate to resort to military action. Germany has no demands on Western Europe at this stage. Its recent demand for colonies from Britain and France is just a political strategy of advancing by retreating, bargaining with Britain and France, and does not come from its heart. Britain and France have huge economic resources, a strong heavy industrial base, and strong naval and air power, and are not as easy to attack and capture as Poland. This was also expected by Germany. This is why it did not hesitate to use military offensive action against Poland, but limited itself to military defensive action against Britain and France; that is why the military situation in Western Europe has been in a state of semi-sleep.

But the progress of the war, like a horse running down a steep slope, cannot be stopped once it starts and must reach an end before it can stop. Germany's accomplished fact of Poland must be recognized by Britain and France, which is Germany's minimum demand. On the other hand, Britain and France believe that to restore peace, not only must the original state of Poland be restored, but also the independence of the Czech Republic and Austria must be restored, and Germany must respect international treaties, all of which are unacceptable to the aggressive Nazi Germany. On the other hand, Britain and France will not abandon their policies without getting a reason to stop the war. As Lord Samuel, the great leader of the British Liberal Party, said, "Now is not the time for the British and French governments to draft peace terms or a new European order. We understand very well that the kind of peace we need is different from the Treaty of Versailles. But at this stage, we must concentrate on defeating Hitlerism and the philosophy that is destroying Europe. What the British people need most is perseverance. Perseverance is more important than everything else, and it is what has made the British nation great in history." British Secretary of the Navy Churchill also mentioned in his radio speech yesterday that "Britain is forced to fight, so it can only maintain the war until the other side is tired of fighting." This shows that peace is impossible in the stalemate stage of the war; then we can only continue the war to decide who wins and who loses. The current stage is a turning point in the European war. Germany's westward advance may extend to the Atlantic coast - the Netherlands or Belgium is its target. Although the Dutch authorities deny Germany's threat to it, the fact that the Dutch army has been sent to key fortresses on the border and that the dikes have been breached shows that the Netherlands has felt a serious threat. Due to the lessons of the last war, there is almost no such thing as neutrality in international law. As long as it is beneficial to military operations, tearing up treaties and violating the so-called neutrality of other countries is what countries engaged in war do not hesitate to do. Furthermore, from the perspective of modern military strategy, if you want to quickly resolve the war, you must take the offensive to achieve your goals. In short, the failure of the Belgian and Dutch mediation of peace can be regarded as the failure of Germany's so-called "war of nerves" and "peace offensive," and can also be regarded as the end of the prelude to the European War. If there is no unexpected and sudden reversal on the German side in the future, then large-scale battles will begin immediately; the offensive must be launched by Germany, and its sharp edge may not be spared Belgium, the Netherlands, or even Switzerland, otherwise there is absolutely no hope of a quick resolution. As for Britain and France, they will likely fight defensively and use delay to restrain the enemy.

### British and French Troops in North China: Partial Withdrawal to Home Countries, Stating Military Reasons, U.S. Troops Maintain Status Quo

Tokyo - British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura today for an hour. It is reported that the British Ambassador presented Nomura with a note informing him of the upcoming reduction of British troops stationed in North China. The note stated, "The British government, in accordance with the Boxer Protocol of 1901, stationed troops in North China. However, due to the military necessities arising from the European war, it has decided to station in North China only the number of soldiers necessary to protect British property and maintain peace and order." The note also stated that this decision has been communicated to all countries entitled to station troops in North China under the 1901 Protocol. This decision by Britain is welcomed by the Japanese, who claim it is in line with the Japanese government's proposal on September 5th, requesting all belligerent nations to "eliminate all possible causes of unforeseen events between them and Japan in China." The number of British troops to be withdrawn is not yet known. According to semi-official Japanese sources, there are currently about 1,000 British soldiers in North China. (Reuters, 13th)

London - According to British official sources, there are currently 1,000 British troops in North China, including Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanhaiguan. The government has now decided to withdraw 800 of them. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mr. Craigie stated to the Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura recently that this action by Britain does not affect British interests in China. (Associated Press, 13th)

Paris - Regarding the withdrawal of troops from North China by Britain and France to a certain extent, the Ministry of War has issued a statement saying that, in accordance with the 1901 Protocol, the signatory countries may station troops in certain places in North China to secure the sea route to Beijing. At present, only the governments of Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan still enjoy this right. With the outbreak of the European war, the governments of Britain and France believe it is appropriate to withdraw a portion of their troops to transfer them elsewhere. Therefore, it has been decided to transfer the majority of the troops back to their home countries. However, the assets held by each country in various places in Beijing will still be protected, and the original right to station troops will still be retained. The British and French concessions in Tianjin will still maintain a considerable number of troops to maintain order. This decision has been communicated to the governments of the other signatory countries. In addition, the French concession in Shanghai still has a considerable number of troops. The original police force in the French concessions in Hankou and Guangzhou has been greatly reinforced to replace the troops. (Havas, 13th)

Washington - The U.S. State Department stated that the status quo of the American troops stationed in North China will not be changed due to the partial withdrawal of British troops there. (Reuters, 13th)

Tokyo - British Ambassador to Japan Mr. Craigie formally notified the Japanese Foreign Minister today, stating that Britain has decided to withdraw most of the British troops in North China due to needs elsewhere, leaving only a small number of troops in Tianjin to protect British property and maintain order. The Japanese side is very satisfied with this decision by the British side, considering it an initial indication of Britain relinquishing interests in North China. News outlets believe that this action by Britain demonstrates improved relations between Britain and Japan and that pending issues between Britain and Japan are expected to be resolved soon. (Associated Press, 13th)

London - After the War Office announced last night that the majority of British troops in North China would be withdrawn, reliable sources stated today that British troops in Shanghai may also be withdrawn in the future. The position of the British forces' defense area in Shanghai will be taken over by American troops, as an agreement has already been reached on this point. (Associated Press, 13th)

Beijing - The current number of troops and guards stationed in Tianjin and Beijing by various countries is approximately as follows: Beijing - Britain 100, France 150, United States 300, Italy 40; Tianjin - Britain 200, France 100, United States 150, Italy 100. (Domei, 13th)

### Two German Cargo Ships Sail Away from Nagasaki

Tokyo - According to Japanese sources last night, two German cargo ships that had been staying in Nagasaki since the outbreak of the European war sailed elsewhere on Saturday night. It is believed that the two cargo ships have evaded the British naval patrol. One of the German ships is 6,100 tons, and the other is 5,173 tons. Both were carrying soybeans from Korea to Rotterdam. Due to the outbreak of the European war, they were forced to seek refuge in Nagasaki. It was widely rumored last week that these two German ships had unloaded the soybeans and loaded coal instead. According to observations by several naval experts, the actions of these two German ships seemed to be to refuel German warships operating in the Pacific. When the two German cargo ships were loading coal in Nagasaki, rumors circulated that the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" had arrived in the Pacific from the Cape of Good Hope. (Associated Press, 13th)

Local Report - The British naval authorities in this port today denied receiving any information that two German cargo ships had escaped the British naval patrol from Nagasaki and sailed elsewhere. (Associated Press, 13th)

### Six Pending Issues Between the U.S. and Japan Resolved

Tokyo - The Japanese government is gradually resolving the issue of Japanese military actions in China harming American interests in China through compensation and other means. The matters that have been successfully resolved were announced today by the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the contents of which are as follows: (1) The university run by Americans in the Shanghai area, which was occupied by the Japanese army, was returned to its original owners in mid-October. (2) The American church in Jimo, Shandong Province, which was destroyed during the Japanese army's bombing of the Chinese army, has been compensated. (3) The Japanese army withdrew from the American church in Linping, Zhejiang Province. (4) The farm operated by Americans in Dachangzhen, Jiangsu Province, which had been a restricted area, has had its restrictions lifted. (5) The loss suffered by the American church in Zhongshan County due to the Japanese naval bombardment has been compensated. (6) The overturned American sailboat incident in Shameen, Guangzhou, has been compensated. (Domei, 13th)

### Economic Future of the Philippines

Manila - U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Francis Burton Harrison delivered a speech at the American Chamber of Commerce here today, recognizing that the Philippine Islands face extremely serious economic difficulties. There are two ways for the Filipinos to solve these difficulties: (1) Economic nationalism, characterized by strict government control, while politics also easily tends towards autocracy. (2) Free trade and a free economy like in the United States. He also said that even if the Philippine Islands become independent, they can still cooperate with the United States. Although the trade relationship at that time needs to be readjusted, it will establish a more permanent and stable foundation. (Associated Press, 13th)

### Churchill Explains the Meaning of the Current European War: Not Just the Elimination of Hitler Leading to Democracy, Allies Have Been Dominant for Ten Weeks

London - First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill said in a radio address last night that the first ten weeks since the beginning of the war have proven the superiority of the Allies. The ability of Britain and France to restore the lives of Poland and Czechia is increasing day by day. Britain and France have repeatedly tried to prevent war and maintain peace, leading to many events that should not have happened. However, since Britain is now forced to fight, it can only continue the war until the other side is tired of war. One of two things must happen: either the principles that Britain and France uphold in this world fail, or the Hitler and Nazi regimes, as well as Germany's continuous threat to Europe, are completely destroyed. This is inevitable. Everyone should make a determination about this solid and disturbing fact.

Churchill then spoke of the Netherlands and Belgium, saying that Germany had given solemn guarantees to these two countries, but now it has concentrated large forces on their borders. I do not want to predict whether Hitler will be driven mad and commit this greatest sin, but I can say with certainty that the fate of the Netherlands and Belgium is also the fate of Poland, Czechia, and Austria, and it will be decided by the victory of Britain and France. If Britain and France fail miserably, everyone will be slaves, leaving only the hands of the United States to protect human rights. If Britain and France do not perish, then these countries will also be saved and restored to life and freedom. Although Britain does not ignore the strength of the enemy, it is not disturbed by its vicious threats and is prepared to endure the hardships when its threats become a reality. The British people have made various preparations at the beginning of the war, and their calmness and determination are commendable. Now, ten weeks into the war, the British Navy and Air Force have both strengthened compared to before, and the Army has also doubled. The attacks of German submarines have been controlled. Britain's global business is continuing with 4,000 ships, of which 2,500 are constantly traveling at sea. The superiority of the British Air Force in terms of pilots and aircraft has indeed exceeded that of the enemy. In combat, our aircraft have shot down fifteen German overseas aircraft without losing a single one of our own. Our science applied to war is already superior to that of the enemy, and it is still gradually improving.

Churchill continued to talk about the various events that are beneficial to Britain, saying that Italy, which we were previously worried about being dragged away from its historical relationship with Britain and France in the Mediterranean, is now strictly adhering to neutrality, and its relationship with Britain and France will be even more fruitful in the future. As for Japan, no new disputes have arisen between Britain and Japan. Italy and Japan had previously joined the German side in the Anti-Comintern Pact, but now they find it difficult to blindly follow Hitler and Ribbentrop's capricious actions. As for the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance treaty, its importance cannot be underestimated. The Soviet government represented by Stalin has forever shattered Germany's dream of advancing eastward. The Soviet Union, like a bear, has blocked Germany's path to the Black Sea with its left paw and seized control of the Baltic Sea with its right paw. No matter how history records this event in the future, the situation we must examine now is extremely clear: Germany's eastward advance has been blocked, and it must seek to achieve its goals in Britain and France, or perish. Based on my experience in the last war, I do not want to be overconfident. I know that the future will be fraught with storms and dangers, but I feel that today's Germany is weaker than the Germany that was forced to beg for a truce by the Allies and the United States twenty-one years ago. I also believe that the German government is aware that it has no certainty of success, because Germany today looks around the world and sees no friend who looks favorably upon it. Italy has turned its attention elsewhere, Japan is also hesitant, Turkey and the Muslim countries are now striving to advance, and India and China, no matter how they feel about other events, will certainly not welcome Germany's victory. It is no secret which side the United States sympathizes with. The Soviet Union is only giving Germany a hard stare. Therefore, the whole world today is opposed to Hitler and his ideology. Even within Germany, there are millions of people who do not support the various evils and corruption created by the Nazi machine. Let us muster our courage to deal with various complexities and dangers, because the final elimination of Germany's abominable ambitions can pave the way for the peoples of all countries to move towards unity, and the scale of this unity is far beyond what we can achieve without this war. I have a close friendship with Prime Minister Chamberlain, and I do not fully agree with all of Chamberlain's opinions. However, Chamberlain is a very strong person with a strong personality, and he is now seeking victory with a strong attitude, just as he worked hard for peace in the past. (Reuters, 12th)

### Britain Cannot Completely Blockade Germany: German Submarine Sinks One British Ship in a Week

London - Diplomatic sources here recently stated that Britain does not intend to completely blockade Germany, because this move conflicts with international law, and the Baltic Sea is not under the control of the British Navy. Fortunately, the measures for inspecting wartime contraband have become increasingly effective and are sufficient to restrain Germany, and they do not excessively delay the ships of neutral countries (each inspection averages no more than forty-eight hours). Therefore, there is no need to intensify the blockade of Germany. (Havas, 13th)

London - Officials have announced that in the past week, only the British ship "Cameo Coast" (961 tons) was sunk by a German submarine. (Havas, 13th)

### German Air Force Reconnoiters the North Sea, Bombs British Fleet

North Sea Coast - A special correspondent for Haitong News Agency reported today on the German Air Force's reconnaissance of the North Sea and bombing of British destroyers, stating, "The German air squadron is conducting reconnaissance of the North Sea today. This reconnaissance and bombing has not been carried out just once since the start of the war. As a result, the British fleet is keeping a respectful distance. Battleships and cruisers do not dare to appear in the North Sea. After a two-hour flight, our group arrived in British territorial waters, flying hundreds of meters high. Looking down through binoculars, we discovered six plumes of black smoke. Upon closer inspection, they were six British destroyers. When the six ships caught sight of the German Air Force, they opened fire, firing a total of seventeen shells, none of which hit their target. At that time, we were flying as high as three thousand meters. We dropped three bombs. The first two bombs did not hit the British destroyers, but whether the third bomb injured them is impossible to determine due to the high altitude. However, we have safely completed our North Sea reconnaissance mission." (Haitong, 13th)

### Germany Implements Clothing Rationing System

Berlin - Germany is implementing a clothing rationing system, limited to men's overcoats, women's winter coats, various linens, and various uniforms. Some textiles are not restricted. Anyone making a new overcoat must submit their old overcoat to the authorities for inspection before being allowed to purchase it. Linen restrictions will be relaxed once imported goods are secured. However, during the period of restrictions, people will be allowed to purchase linen if they have festive events. (Haitong, 13th)

### Netherlands and Belgium Strive for Self-Defense, Dutch Prime Minister's Speech to Stabilize the People's Hearts, Belgian Army Minister Declares Strong Strength

The Hague - Prime Minister Gerbrandy Colijn of the Netherlands recently delivered a radio address to stabilize the people's hearts, stating, "There are many alarming words in the news coming from foreign countries. People should not completely believe them. It is natural for the belligerent countries to exaggerate the intentions of the enemy. The mobilization of our country's army is not just for show. Its size is directly proportional to the degree of tension on the border. However, this does not mean that the threats our country faces have become acute." (Havas, 13th)

Brussels - Belgian Defense Minister General Denis announced in a radio address tonight that the Belgian army is strong enough to cope with any eventuality. He said, "After taking various protective measures in the military recently, the army's organization has been perfected and can be deployed at any time. I am very optimistic about the future. However, so-called optimism is not a dangerous, blind optimism. On the contrary, what I am saying is based on facts that I know well. The optimistic mentality is based on these facts. Our country's army is not only strong, but also determined to defend the country. Furthermore, the progress of various measures recently adopted is excellent. The people of the whole country can unite and enthusiastically support the current administrative system and be the backing of the army. In short, our country does not threaten other countries, but if our territory and democratic system are threatened, we will definitely rise up to defend them until the last person." Observers here commented that this is an indirect warning to Germany about threatening Belgium's neutrality and independence, and the tone is resolute to the extreme. (Havas, 12th)

Amsterdam - The commander of the Immeton fortress in the Netherlands issued a public notice last night stating that ships are prohibited from entering or leaving the port at night. (Haitong, 13th)

Geneva - A semi-official British report received in Paris yesterday morning stated that Germany had reiterated to the Netherlands last week that if the Netherlands strictly adheres to its neutrality policy, then Germany will also respect its neutral status. However, this report has not been confirmed by Berlin and The Hague, so international figures consider it unreliable. It is believed that this is a probing action by the British intelligence department, wanting to induce Germany to issue a denial in order to prove that Germany has no intention of respecting the neutrality of the Netherlands. Swiss press sources believe that the reason why Swiss newspapers did not publish this news is that they do not want to be exploited. (Haitong, 13th)

Paris - A correspondent for the Paris Daily News in Sullyecker claimed that according to news directly from Berlin, the reason why the German army has not invaded the Netherlands so far is due to the strong intervention of senior members of the German command. Some generals fear that this kind of invasion will lead the United States to actively participate in the war. The correspondent also claimed that this invasion was advocated by Hitler and a group of Nazi extremists. (Reuters, 13th)

### U.S. Citizens in the Netherlands and Belgium Ordered to Leave the Country

The Hague - It is reported that Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands received U.S. Minister Gordon at the palace last night for half an hour. It is believed that this conversation was related to the peace movement of the Netherlands and Belgium. (Reuters, 13th)

New York - The Commercial Daily recently reported that the American Black Diamond Steamship Company has decided to resume the transportation of goods between its ports in this country and the ports of Antwerp in Belgium, Rotterdam and Amsterdam in the Netherlands. However, because the ports in the Netherlands and Belgium have been designated as war zones, U.S. ships are not allowed to enter according to the new neutrality law. The company is now planning to charter Norwegian cargo ships to transport the goods. (Havas, 13th)

### Germany Still Studying Dutch-Belgian Appeal

Berlin - According to observations here, Germany does not seem to be able to submit a reply to the peace appeal of the Netherlands and Belgium. Haitong News Agency learned from well-informed sources that the note is currently being carefully studied by the Berlin authorities. It must be carefully studied before a reply can be made. The German government has instructed its ambassadors to the Netherlands and Belgium to convey this intention to the governments of their respective host countries. Regarding the reply made by British King George and French President Lebrun, authorities here refused to comment, only stating that the note is also being studied. Regarding the point in the British and French replies that the annexation of Austria by Germany must be cancelled, senior Nazi officials told Haitong News Agency reporters that this proves that the peace that Britain needs is a peace that destroys Germany. It must be understood that the annexation of Austria was based on the right of national self-determination, and the "new world" that Halifax seeks is to suppress the right of national self-determination. (Haitong, 13th)

### U.S. Newspaper Commentary

New York - Regarding the mediation of peace by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, the replies made by the heads of state of Britain and France, the radio address given yesterday by British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill, and the threat of Germany invading the Netherlands and Belgium, various morning newspapers here have combined and commented on this matter. They all said that the war goals of Britain and France have been clearly presented by the heads of state of those countries and First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill. The New York Times wrote that the unfair treatment that Germany has inflicted on Austria, Czechia, and Poland must be compensated, and the aggressive threats it has inflicted on European countries must be lifted. This is where the war goals of Britain and France lie, and they should be sympathized with. If Germany invades Belgium and the Netherlands, then the great value of these war goals will become more and more obvious. The neutral countries will also become more and more indignant towards Germany. Even in terms of U.S. public opinion, it will cause incalculable influence. The New York Tribune wrote, "Sooner or later, there will be a major struggle between the Nazi Party, representing 80 million people, and the Anglo-French nations. Before this struggle appears, there is no basis for peace in Europe, and how can we easily talk about peace?" (Havas, 13th)

### Clues Found in Munich Bombing Case

Berlin - Today, the German News Agency released the investigation of the Munich beer hall bombing case, saying that many people have testified that a worker worked in the beer hall.

In addition, it has been found that two shops manufacture clocks for time bombs that are the same as those used in the Munich bombing case. It is said that thousands of people are providing information to the special committee investigating this case. (Reuters, 12th)

Amsterdam - According to neutral sources, a large-scale search has begun in Germany since the Munich bombing case. The secret police are very busy in many cities. The victims are all Jews, restorationists, Catholics, and so-called "reactionaries." Communists have not been mentioned so far. (Reuters, 13th)

### American Celebrities Discuss the Future of the World: Knox Expresses His Views

Chicago, USA: The University of Chicago held a symposium today. Republican leader Frank Knox, the vice-presidential candidate in the 1936 election, immediately expressed his views, stating, "When a peace conference is held after the end of the European war, the United States can only send observers to attend. In my opinion, there is only one way to guarantee peace: to divide the world into three major economic units, one for the Americas, one for Europe, and one for the Far East. Among them, European countries should establish a federal system, based not on political concepts but on economic concepts. In addition, due to the special problems in the Far East, countries should establish a customs union to form an economic unit." University of Chicago Professor Henry Schultz then spoke, expressing his opposition, stating, "Dividing the world into three units will only cause disturbances and confrontation. What is needed now is cooperation between all countries in the world, not just between countries in one hemisphere." (Havas Agency Dispatch, 13th)

### Six Balkan Countries Establish Two Agreements: Intensifying the Organization of a Neutral Bloc

London: Well-informed sources here have said that the organization of a neutral bloc by the Balkan countries can now be considered a fait accompli. The participants will include Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. It is said that these countries have reached a final agreement on the following two points: (1) Hungary and Bulgaria will temporarily abandon their territorial claims; (2) The troops of the Balkan countries stationed near the borders of neighboring countries will be simultaneously withdrawn within a short period of time. According to some observers, it will not be easy for the Balkan countries to form a strong bloc, because, firstly, it is still unknown whether Bulgaria will agree to shelve its demand for access to a seaport on the Aegean coast, and secondly, the Italian government, which previously expressed support for the idea of forming a neutral bloc, has now adopted a wait-and-see attitude. However, it is generally believed that if this bloc can be established, it will be a great gain for Britain and France, if not a direct diplomatic victory, because this move will stabilize the situation in the eastern Mediterranean and strengthen the Anglo-French-Turkish mutual assistance pact.

### Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Stalled Again: Finnish Delegation Returns Home; Finnish Foreign Minister Claims Great Concessions Made; Soviet Newspapers Reveal Soviet Demands on Finland

Capital of Finland: According to official sources, the Finnish delegation will return home from Moscow this evening. (Havas, 13th)

Capital of Sweden: The Finnish delegation has decided to return from Moscow. Soviet newspapers are once again attacking Finland. Upon hearing this, people here have had a bad impression. "Svenska Dagbladet" reported that Finland has made as many concessions as possible. If the Soviet Union is not sincere, the Finnish delegation has no need to stay in Moscow. "The independence and national self-determination of the Nordic countries will never be abandoned. Finland is now fulfilling this responsibility, which is very painful but worthy of pride." (Havas Agency Dispatch, 13th)

Helsinki: Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko stated today that the Soviet-Finnish negotiations have now broken down. Finland's concessions have reached the point where no more concessions can be made, but they still cannot satisfy the Soviet Union's demands, so what is the point of continuing negotiations? Therefore, the government decided to recall Finnish chief negotiator Juho Kusti Paasikivi within twelve days. (United Press Dispatch, 13th)

Capital of Finland: Regarding the current negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko told foreign reporters that our country has made great concessions to the Soviet Union's demands. The country's security, especially the security of the Leningrad area, has been guaranteed. However, various demands that would hinder our country's security cannot be accepted. The Soviet Union claims that our country has mobilized troops near its border, but this is not the case. Furthermore, the representatives of Finland and the Soviet Union have not continued negotiations for the past four days, but the two sides have exchanged letters, explaining their views, and have agreed that the current negotiations should not be rushed. Therefore, even if our delegation returns from Moscow, it should not be considered that the negotiations have broken down. In fact, if the representatives of the two countries cannot continue negotiations in the shortest possible time, our delegation may return home for a while, but whether it will happen and when it will happen have not been decided. In short, Finland and the Soviet Union will not resort to arms. The content of our counter-proposal is not convenient to publish at this time to avoid hindering the progress of the negotiations. (Havas Dispatch, 12th)

Moscow: The Soviet naval newspaper "Red Fleet" recently published an article entitled "The Problem of Soviet Maritime Defense in the Northwest," revealing the demands that the Soviet government has made to Finland. It stated that the Soviet Union demands that Finland cede a naval base near the port of Hanko and allow it to build fortifications on the eastern islands of the Gulf of Finland and in the Styur Sund area, especially on the islands of Bolshoy Tyuters and Gogland, and the port of Humaljoki on the Karelia Peninsula. As for Hanko, if the Soviet Union establishes a naval base there, it will be impossible for foreign fleets to enter the Gulf of Finland. Even if the enemy occupies the Åland Islands and attempts to enter the Gulf of Finland through the waterway between the islands and Hanko, it will be impossible. As for Bolshoy Tyuters and Humaljoki, the Soviet Union must build defenses on these islands and ports to protect the area near Leningrad. In addition, the islands of Seskär, Lavansaari, and Tyytärsaari, east of the island of Hanko in the western Gulf of Finland, are the gateway to the Soviet port of Kronstadt. If they are not held by the Soviet Union, Leningrad cannot be properly defended. Even the current border between Finland and the Soviet Union in the far north is too unnatural and needs to be revised." The newspaper concluded, "For the sake of Finland, only by cooperating with the Soviet Union can it resist foreign air raids." (Havas Dispatch, 13th)

Helsinki: Political figures here believe that if the Soviet authorities do not invite the Finnish delegation to hold negotiations, the delegation will leave Moscow today or tomorrow. In the past five days, the Finnish delegation and the Soviet government have exchanged letters, discussing various disputes, but have failed to break the deadlock in the negotiations. (Haitong Dispatch, 13th)

### British Press Magnate on Trial in London: Lord Rothermere Testifies About Diplomatic Activities

London: The case of Lord Rothermere violating his contract opened in the High Court today. Rothermere detailed the process of the contract for an annual remuneration of £5,000, stating that the first contract was signed in July 1932. At that time, Vere Harmsworth wrote to Princess Stephanie von Hohenlohe, discussing the accidents that might occur in Germany and Hungary, asking her to report the situation at any time, and instructing him to contact Queen Nina of Greece. The first check for £5,000 was paid at that time, and another £3,400 was paid twice as expenses until December of that year. He also promised to pay another £5,000 each in January 1934 and January 1935. Rothermere denied that the payment of the first £5,000 was conditional on the Princess not accepting £25,000 for writing for a newspaper. When the judge asked about the libel case in the French newspaper, Rothermere testified that this matter was quite serious for him and the Princess. After a detailed investigation, he accepted the advice and ignored it, but the Princess was still free to take any action she wished on this matter. He told her the news he had obtained in France and did not coerce her to sue the French newspaper. Rothermere admitted that in a certain payment, he had mistaken £5,000 for £500, but he was usually not astute about money, so such mistakes were not surprising. In 1936, the Princess came to visit, saying that she had to undergo a very dangerous operation and would need a long period of recuperation. Later, due to his company's request to continue her service, he agreed to find her tasks in 1937 and 1938. However, from 1938, he resigned from all positions due to old age and took a rest. Before the Princess set off for Berlin for vacation in January of that year, he paid her £1,700. Since then, he has not asked the Princess to continue to serve him. In total, from July 1932 to January 1938, the amount paid to the Princess amounted to more than £51,000. The judge questioned Rothermere in detail about his participation in the attempted restoration of Hungary and the articles he published in the "Daily Mail." Rothermere replied that one of the articles he wrote was entitled "I Wish to Be Friendly with Germany," but this article was published before Hitler's rise to power. Rothermere denied that he had said that if the German-Austrian royal family were restored, he would occupy a considerable position in history. The reason he was involved in the Hungarian affair was that after Hindenburg's death, the whole of Central Europe would fall into chaos. The only way to stabilize the situation was to restore the German-Austrian royal family. Rothermere did not say that the Princess's task was not only as an envoy, but sometimes she would convey his opinions to Hitler, Hungarian Regent Horthy, and the German Crown Prince, etc. The trial was then adjourned for continuation. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)

### Romania's National Renaissance Front Holds First Meeting

The Hague: According to sources from Berlin, there are a total of 13,000 Germans in Estonia, most of whom have retreated back to Germany. The last group of 1,000 will complete their retreat in January 1940. These people own 4,000 houses and 60,000 hectares of land in Estonia, worth 100 million Reichsmarks, all of which are taken over by the Estonian government and compensated by shipping goods to Germany. It is estimated that it will take several years to fully repay the debt. (Havas Dispatch, 13th)

### Ma Chaojun Describes His Journey Through Ten Southeastern Provinces: A Glimpse of the Situation

Chongqing: Former Nanjing Mayor Ma Chaojun, who recently led a comfort mission through ten southeastern provinces, has now returned here and described the lives of the people in the areas nominally controlled by the Japanese, which is surprising and exciting. He said that his trip covered 8,000 miles. In addition to various other observations, he also saw the emergence of new troops. These new troops are experienced, brave, and serious, and are prepared to fight. Ma Chaojun especially praised the young women's service corps that assisted in educating children and women. When Ma Chaojun mentioned the prosperity of the areas he passed through, he said that Zhejiang Province's revenue for the last fiscal year was 30 million yuan, which is the highest record in the province's history. Although the Japanese occupy a part of Zhejiang Province, this remarkable financial achievement is due to agricultural and industrial production, peace and order, and good administration. In the past three years, the agricultural output of most areas in the southeast has doubled compared to the past. In addition to planting the usual grains of the south, farmers, under the guidance of government experts, cultivate wheat, sorghum, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and cotton in mountainous or semi-arid areas, which are more profitable. The output of famous products such as silk from Suzhou and Wuxi and tea from Anhui Province has also increased. The most exciting thing is that farmers automatically sever ties with the Japanese. For example, silkworm farmers in Suzhou and Wuxi are unwilling to sell to the Japanese for 70 yuan per dan, but accept a lower price of 50 yuan to sell to Chinese. The people are willing to work 12 hours a day and enthusiastically support the wartime industrial plan. The income of farmers and workers has increased. Except for the narrow Japanese military stationed in the Qian area, farmers and workers are not disturbed by robbery and extortion. A mutual protection and self-defense system has been implemented in various places, so the local area is peaceful and orderly. Tax collectors are selected from middle school students. What impressed him most was the result of training in various aspects. The women who volunteered to serve in the United States, Britain, and France during the Great War would be ashamed of what Chinese women in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan are doing, because Chinese women are taking over the guarding and construction tasks undertaken by men without hesitation. The training is quite simple, that is, officers train soldiers, and soldiers teach the people what they have learned. The people have received sufficient military training due to their contact with the army. Wartime engineering, cultivation, harvesting, group singing, drama, and discussions are often conducted in cooperation between the military and the people. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)

### The Northern Comfort Mission Presents Flags in Suiyuan West

Somewhere in Suiyuan West: On the morning of the 11th, the Northern Comfort Mission held a ceremony to present flags and gifts to all the soldiers fighting in Suiyuan West. Tens of thousands of troops and civilians attended. At the foot of the Yin Mountains and on the banks of the Yellow River, the temperature has reached four degrees below zero, but the Chinese officers and soldiers are still wearing short jackets. A deputy commander accepted the flags on behalf of the troops. He Zhonghan delivered a speech, praising the soldiers in Suiyuan West for fighting bloody battles in the freezing cold, guarding the gateway to the Northwest, and preventing the Japanese army from invading further. Pan Xiuren, a representative of the Political Participation Council, spoke, reporting that although the comfort money brought this time was only 5,000 yuan, it was all saved by the people in the rear by cutting back on food and clothing. Every drop was collected and was enough to represent the gratitude and care of the people across the country. A certain deputy commander responded, expressing extreme humility and saying that the national humiliation had not been avenged, and he had no face to accept comfort. However, in recent years, the front-line troops have indeed been able to face death as if it were returning home. After being injured three or five times, they still resolutely refuse to retreat, and remain loyal and brave. In the future, they will further promote this spirit, kill the remaining Japanese, and repay the people of the country. (Dispatch, 11th)

### Shantou Foreign Merchants End Business: British and American Missionaries Decide Not to Leave

Shantou Correspondence: After the Japanese massively reinforced their troops in Shantou, land and water transportation outside the war zone was completely cut off. Rice is becoming increasingly scarce, and two pounds of broken rice can be purchased for one yuan, but it is still not easy to obtain. There are British and American warships in Shantou Harbor, and the foreigners living outside Jiaoshi rely entirely on the British and American warships for their food. Only one British ship enters the port each week and is not allowed to load any goods ashore, and must leave the port within three hours. In addition, Japanese ships, Guang Sheng Wan and Fujian Wan, run on the Taiwan-Hong Kong line every week. When passing through Shantou, a small number of people with special permits disembark. All letters sent to Hong Kong or other ports must first be stamped and inspected in Taiwan before being sent to the Hong Kong post office. The journey from Shantou to Hong Kong is only one night by water, but ordinary letters take 20 days to reach the recipient. Recently, Chao'an, Anbu, and Chenghai have been attacked by Chinese troops every day. Gunfire can be heard outside the city. Refugees returning home are afraid of local unrest and have fled into Shantou City. The Japanese army suspects them of being plainclothes soldiers and conducts strict searches at various intersections, demanding to see the good citizen certificates and asking where they come from and where they live. In some shops and houses that accommodate too many villagers, the Japanese army often knocks on the door at night to search, and the people cannot live in peace for one night. All foreign firms have sold off their goods and have mostly closed down automatically by the end of October. Only three American drawn-thread companies, out of consideration for the livelihoods of thousands of female workers, are temporarily maintaining the status quo. British and American missionaries in Chaozhou and Meizhou are still living in Jiaoshi and have decided not to leave Shantou in order to maintain the church's work.

### Battles Occur Between Hangzhou and Huzhou

Suzhou-Jiaxing Road Suspends Passenger Ticket Sales: Japanese Military Transportation Extremely Busy

Suzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army in this county suddenly notified the railway station on the morning of the 8th that all passenger tickets for the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road stations sold on that day would be refunded, and transportation would be suspended, causing the general public to travel back and forth in vain that day. It is said that the reason for the suspension of passenger ticket sales is that battles have recently occurred between Hangzhou and Huzhou, and the Japanese army is busy with military transportation, so it ordered passenger ticket sales to be suspended. The period of suspension will depend on the war situation.

According to those who fled from Huzhou to Suzhou, the Chinese troops stationed in the suburbs of the city have recently been heavily reinforced and have launched an attack on the city. People living in the city during the day can also hear clear gunfire. The Japanese army has relaxed the restrictions on those leaving the city, but those entering the city are subject to special searches and must also provide information on where they will be staying in the city. It is also said that X0,000 regular Chinese troops have crossed Hangzhou and advanced to Xinshi, Shuanglin, Ling'an, and other places, and the situation is quite favorable. Although the Japanese army has more than 20 troops, including Tamura, Ito, Miyajima, Ishii, Taiqi, Myao, and Morita, they cannot diminish the spirit of the troops in the slightest.

### Bishop Yu Bin Discusses the Funeral of Ma Xiangbo: Death in Liangshan After One Year of Illness; Mass Held in Haiphong

Kunming: Bishop Yu Bin told reporters about Ma Xiangbo's last moments and funeral, saying that Ma was originally from Danyang, Jiangsu, and was a member of the Nanjing Church. He had always been very concerned about Ma. After hearing the bad news in Chongqing, he flew to Liangshan to help with the funeral arrangements. Ma was born on March 19, 1840, which coincided with the start of the foreign troubles. He witnessed how China was bullied by foreign races throughout his life, and his life's work was focused on how to wash away the national shame. His strategy was based on his devout religious beliefs. He advocated education and science, which led to the creation of Aurora University and Fudan University, and the promotion of Fu Jen Catholic University. When the all-out war of resistance broke out, Ma moved to Guilin and planned to move to Kunming, but he was blocked by illness in Liangshan until he died, exactly one year later. Although Ma lived in Vietnam, his heart was always in his motherland. After October 19, the weather in Liangshan suddenly changed, and Ma's temperature rose to 38 degrees. He was treated by a doctor. Although the fever subsided slightly, he was not always lucid. On the night of the 22nd, he could not sleep. On the 25th, his condition worsened, and he asked the priest of Liangshan Church to perform the religious last rites for him. On the 29th, a certain gentleman passed through Liangshan and told him the details of the great victory in northern Hunan. Ma was very excited to hear this and was able to sit up that night and eat a little liquid food. He became overly excited, which led to another sleepless night. On the 3rd of this month, phlegm developed in his throat, and he was unable to vomit. His breathing became weak. At about 9 p.m., he called his family members closer and asked them some questions, but because his strength was too weak, his voice was unclear. Those who were present at the time only heard the vague sound of ("dis... dis... news"). The family then said ("The nation's affairs are being led by the leaders and government officials who are leading the national army and people to fight against the war until victory is achieved"). At that time, Ma could not speak and nodded slightly to signal his understanding. He then fell into a deep sleep. The family asked the doctor to administer medication, but the doctor said that this was a sign of the old man's life force gradually exhausted, and administering medication would only increase his suffering, so he did not administer it. He passed away peacefully at zero hour on the morning of the 4th. He was encoffined on the 5th, and his face looked lifelike. On the 6th, the priest and the assistant priest welcomed the coffin into the church and held a memorial mass. The coffin was sent to the funeral home for temporary placement. When Yu arrived in Liangshan, Ma had already been buried, so he paid his respects to the place where the coffin was placed and prayed for him. Later, the Chinese Consul General in Vietnam initiated a principal service and memorial mass for Ma in Haiphong. Yu went to Haiphong on the 9th. The principal service mass was held on the 10th, and many people attended. He then came to Yunnan via Hanoi. Ma devoted himself to education, and his students and old friends are all over the world. They must be very concerned about the circumstances of Ma's death and funeral, so I am giving you a detailed account. The immortal achievements of Ma in establishing virtue and words, and his great personality, can be summarized by the couplet from President Yu ("Glory returns to God, life and death protect China"), etc. It is said that Bishop Yu can fly back to Chongqing before the 20th.

### American Ambassador Johnson to Leave Chongqing Tomorrow

Chongqing: American Ambassador Johnson has booked tickets to Hong Kong via Shanghai and is scheduled to depart by plane on the 15th of this month.

Today, it was also reported that French Ambassador Cosme had taken the route through Vietnam to Chongqing. After the American ambassador leaves Chongqing, the new Soviet ambassador, Panyushkin, will be the only ambassador here. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)

### Unprecedented Grandeur of Charity Football Match: China United and England-France Combined Team Each Score Three Goals, No Winner Decided; 15,000 Fans Crowd the Recreation Ground

Yesterday afternoon at the Recreation Ground, the China United team played against the England-France combined team in this season's first Sino-Western charity football match. Both sides showcased the essence of Sino-Western football, with beautiful performances that captivated the audience. Spectators scrambled to attend, reaching over 15,000 people, a rare and unprecedented scene. The result of the match saw China United take the lead in the first half with a score of 3-1. However, in the second half, they conceded two goals within a minute, ultimately resulting in a 3-3 draw, with no winner decided. Yesterday's ticket revenue totaled over 10,100 yuan, which will be divided into three parts: one-third will go to Shanghai refugee relief, and one-third each will go to the England and France wartime relief efforts. The lineups of both sides yesterday were as follows:

China United Team:

Qin Bi Gao

Chen Hong Guang, Zhuang You Ren

Meng Yi Liang, Li Yi Chen, Jiang Zhao Xiang

Cao Qiu Ting, Wu Qi Xiang, Dai Lin Jing, Jia You Liang

England-France Combined Team:

Bao Sai Zhong

Hai Li Sheng, Ke Lai Tuo

Mai Ke Si Gan, Pan Kui Lai, Xue Ge Lun

Tang Mu Xun, Deng Ken, Sai Te Le, Mai Ke Nai De, Pai Er

Unprecedented Spectacle

Yesterday's scene at the Recreation Ground was a grand spectacle rarely seen in the past two years. Even the visit of the Corinthian football team and last year's charity match were not as impressive. Ticket sales began at noon, and by 2 p.m., the north and south stands were packed with people, leaving no room to move. Even half an hour after the start of the match, many fans were still gathered outside the Recreation Ground, eager to enter. South of Avenue Albert and Avenue Joffre, various vehicles were completely jammed, and buses and trolley cars moved at a snail's pace. Some people were even selling tickets at the entrance, raising the price of a 1.10 yuan ticket to 1.50 yuan, and even to 2 yuan a few minutes before the start, with no shortage of buyers. The crowded situation at the entrance yesterday and the method of selling and collecting tickets need to be improved. The Westerners' Association is undoubtedly to blame. A group of female customers were complaining loudly, with only a tiny space for two people. The ticket sellers and collectors were incredibly slow. It is necessary to improve this next time.

Glimpses of the Performance

In yesterday's performance, China United's goalkeeper Qin Bi Gao was the most impressive, saving countless shots and being highly praised. However, the center-back line was quite disappointing, especially when the combined team launched fierce counterattacks in the second half. Li Yi Chen's position was too far forward, forgetting the modern football tactic of the third fullback, which left the two fullbacks isolated. Meng Yi Liang and Jiang Zhao Xiang were unable to contain the activity of the two opposing wingers, and the lack of supply made the forwards stall frequently. Sun Tie Tui's absence due to injury was also a slight disadvantage. The combined team's two fullbacks were the most outstanding, with Hai Li Sheng being even better. The two wingers and inside forwards were exceptionally active and dangerous. If it weren't for Bi Gao's heroic saves, they would have surely suffered defeat.

Impressive Momentum

The match did not start until 2:45 p.m. Sun Jin Shun was absent due to injury and was replaced by Wu Qi Xiang. The defensive lineup largely adopted the reporter's suggestions from yesterday. The bureau's attention to this newspaper shows that our views coincide. The combined team kicked off, and Sedler led the attack westward, but was blocked by Zhao Xiang. Qiu Ting penetrated deep, but was also intercepted by Colete. Qiu Ting passed to A-Kui, who handed it to You Liang, and a high kick went out of bounds. Only two minutes into the match, Yi Chen made a long pass, You Liang crossed, and Qi Xiang went straight down, encountered Colete, and at 20 yards, took a flat shot. Bao Sai Zhong rushed out to save, but the ball slipped in from his left armpit, a clear goal. China United took the lead. Five minutes later, Wu Qi Xiang headed the ball at 10 yards. Bao Sai Zhong caught it but slipped, and the ball bounced up. He quickly grabbed it again, but Dai Lin Jing rushed in like a flying eagle, and the ball and Bao rolled into the net together. Two consecutive goals, and the cheers shook the sky. After that, Wu Qi Xiang and Xu Wen Kui exchanged positions.

3-1 Lead

At 16 minutes, You Liang took a corner kick, Qi Xiang headed it, and Bao punched it not far. Xu Wen Kui took a flat shot, but unfortunately, A Dai was unable to return in time, resulting in an offside. It was a pity. Bi Gao made many heroic saves, and everyone praised him. The stalemate lasted until 31 and a half minutes when Pai Er crossed, and Tang Mu Xun took a powerful flat shot at 20 yards. Qin Bi Gao was unable to save it, and it went into the right corner. China United conceded a goal, making it 2-1. At this time, the combined team's offensive intensified, and China United's goal was often in danger. At 37 minutes, Qi Xiang headed the ball, Bao Sai Zhong punched it out, and Qiu Ting passed to the right. A-Kui took a flat shot at 10 yards, and Bao Sai Zhong finally managed to block it, but You Liang rushed into the net like a hawk, 3-1, China United still leading by two goals. At 40 minutes, Bi Gao caught a high pass from Tang Mu Xun, and Sedler jumped up and bumped into it. Although the ball went into the net, it was disallowed due to a foul. Zhuang You Ren kicked the ball out, and the first half ended, it was lemon time.

Forcing a Draw

The second half began with the sound of fighting, and the combined team went all out, their iron cavalry crisscrossing. At three minutes, Pai Er hooked another shot from the baseline. Hong Guang and Bi Gao both missed, and the ball went under Bi Gao's armpit and into the left post. After the center kick-off, the combined team penetrated deep again. Chen Hong Guang was eager to save and accidentally bumped into Pai Er. At 12 yards, Duncan took the penalty and shot it in from under the crossbar. China United conceded two goals within a minute and were tied at 3-3. The overall situation was thus determined. Both sides were evenly matched, and the situation became increasingly tense. At 15 minutes, A-Kui received a long pass from Yi Chen and took a fierce shot at 20 yards, but it was disallowed due to You Liang being offside. Both of A-Kui's shots hit the bullseye but were disallowed due to offside, a great pity. However, the combined team's counterattacks did not slacken. At 25 minutes, Meng Yi Liang's nose was kicked by Pai Er, and blood flowed profusely. He was injured and left the field. A minute later, he returned to the field with an injury. After that, China United's attack was fierce, determined to win, but they ultimately failed and the game ended in a draw.

### Grand Opening Performance of the Middle School Cup Table Tennis Tournament

University League Defeats Middle School League

The second Shanghai Middle School Cup Table Tennis Championship opened at 7 p.m. the night before in the auditorium of the China Middle School on Qipu Road.

The two players showcased many exciting performances with their alternating strokes and chops. Next was a performance by the women's team. Since the China United women's team did not arrive, the Youth Women's team members were divided into groups for competition. Next was the University League versus the Middle School League. Because the main players of the Middle School League, Fang Xingmin and Hao Guimiao, had been promoted to university, their strength was greatly affected, resulting in a crushing defeat of 1-4. Finally, famous table tennis players performed, with the matches between Li An and Jian Yu Shu, and Ye Mao Zhi and Zhang Zhi Hong being the most exciting.

### A Glimpse of the Supply and Demand of Talent in Shanghai Two Years After the War (4)

Pan Wen An, Zheng Wen Han, Shen Guang Lie

Medical Talent: 6.126%, Physicians: 5%, Pharmacists: 1.3%, Nurses: 2.4%, Midwives: 0.3%, Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctors: 0.2%, Nannies: 1.3%, Military Doctors: 0.1%

Foreign Language Talent: 4.921%, English, French, German, Russian, and Japanese Languages: 3.1%, Translators: 1.8%

Artistic Talent: 4.620%, Fine Arts: 0.9%, Music: 0.5%, Drama: 0.3%, Photography: 0.4%, Commercial Advertising: 1.1%, Sculpture: 0.2%, Design: 1.2%

Agricultural Talent: 1.406%, Agriculture: 0.9%, Animal Husbandry: 0.1%, Sericulture: 0.4%

Other: 1.005%, Working Inland: 1.0%

Total: 2346, 100.00%

The salary expectations of those seeking jobs are even lower than in previous years. 64.1% of people only hope to receive a salary of less than 20 yuan per month. Among them, 20.7% only want room and board and do not care about remuneration. 14.1% seek remuneration of less than 10 yuan. The total number of people seeking remuneration between 50 yuan and 100 yuan is only 5%. Very few people seek more than 100 yuan, only about 1%. Today, the Shanghai cost of living index has risen four times compared to before the war and two or three times compared to a year after the war. This abnormal effort to suppress salary expectations is originally hoped to get a place to eat. However, it is still not possible for everyone to find a job. The difficulty of seeking employment can be seen from this.

Classification of Salary Expectations of Job Seekers (Table 5) Monthly Minimum Salary Number Percentage

Room and board only 486 20.70

Below 10 320 14.10

20 691 29.30

Commercial News

### Food: Rice Becomes a Speculative Commodity

—How Can the People's Food Be Anything But Difficult?—

After a brief turnaround in the rice market in the last two days, yesterday the rising trend became even more intense. This is because various merchants could not agree with the Shanghai market, and the supply was very tight, lacking shipments for a long time. Unexpectedly, the old habits of some hoarders returned, taking advantage of the lack of goods to launch a large-scale operation, speculating and manipulating the market. The situation was chaotic for a time, and the merchants from other provinces started shouting. Even the local merchants saw this favorable situation and quickly followed suit, enthusiastically competing to purchase. Regardless of japonica or indica rice, everything was eagerly bought up, so the prices of various goods rose all the way, becoming more and more intense. For example, even though the amount of Dumi and Sheyang indica rice arriving from the lower reaches of the river to the Nangang Songjiang area was 12 or 13 shipments, and over 20 truckloads, numbering 2,500 or 2,600 bags, arrived by train from the Changshu Jiading Qingpu Songjiang Fengxian Lianhe area, as a result, the prices of both japonica and indica rice rose by about one yuan compared to the previous market. The price of special Changshu japonica rice has been set at 32 yuan, Kuntai high-quality japonica rice has also been set at 30 yuan, Qingjiao kiln green medium rice at 29.23 yuan, lower quality at 28 yuan, special Lujian indica rice at 28.5 yuan, special Sheyang indica rice at 28 yuan, Jiangbei indica rice and Jingwu indica rice at 27.5 yuan, Chenyuan at 31 yuan, and Xinyuan at 30 yuan. The number of transactions was over 20,000 bags.

The price of customer indica rice became more and more sharp yesterday. In addition to the continued support from customer merchants, hoarders inside and outside the industry became even more active. Although some hoarders changed to buying japonica rice, they were still tempted by rumors and continued to buy customer indica rice. However, the customer indica rice had reached its lowest point and the supply was lacking for a long time, so those who manipulated the market seized the opportunity to monopolize it. The price was most evident in the morning, and the selling price was shouted higher and higher. Wuhu indica rice reached 27.5 yuan, and Jiangbei indica rice also exceeded 27 yuan, an increase of 1.35 yuan compared to the previous market. However, after the price rose, the actual sales of this customer have stopped. Although the Japanese merchants have not fully sold out, the source, in addition to some scattered households, is 13,000 bags of Wuhu indica rice newly arrived from the Japanese merchants yesterday. Therefore, the nervousness of the people in the industry has also eased, and the market price will have to be secretly cut by 0.35 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Arrives, Yarn Market Fluctuates

The yarn market yesterday was generally stable due to the closure of all banks, which led to the suspension of business. However, the sales channels for various merchants remained narrow. The market is in a state of fluctuation in the short term. If the foreign exchange rate is allowed to lengthen, or there is a small change, otherwise we must wait for actual sales to promote and reappear a new posture.

The cotton market situation has recently become more stable. This is because overseas European and American cotton markets have risen in unison, leading to a step up in people's sentiment. Fortunately, the exchange rate has lengthened again, and in addition, the source from northern Jiangsu is constantly arriving, which can still be leveled out. It is heard that over 6,000 bags of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the docks yesterday and today, and 1,100 to 1,200 bags of Changyingsha cotton.

Yesterday, 2,480 bags of cotton arrived from Beisha, and 75 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil Soars by Two Yuan

The price of soybean oil soared by two yuan yesterday. Before the opening of the market in the morning, there was a tense situation. This was caused by the manipulators spreading rumors, and there were also rumors that the source was blocked. This caused a commotion to discard the cheap and buy again, and some wind-stirring and wave-making people also helped to fuel the soaring wind. However, in the face of the recent reduction in arrivals, the people's sentiment cannot help but have this effect. Therefore, the price of Jiaozhou oil, because the arrival and inventory are still available, was slightly loose, and the market price only rose by 1.2 yuan, and in the afternoon it still maintained the original market in the morning, with the price opening at 50 yuan. A total of 500 pieces were transacted. Another 100 pieces of Qingqi oil were opened (price details in the market price column), 200 pieces of Yanqi oil, and 30 barrels of Kobe oil, 20 barrels of Qingdao oil, 500 cans of "road goods" Jiangbei canned oil, and 30 cans of Baiwen oil. Peanut oil was not sold to Hong Kong, and only those from this street and Shantou asked about it, and the market price rose slightly by 0.5 yuan. Jiaozhou oil was opened for 100 pieces, and Jiangbei canned oil for 200 cans.

Yesterday, 890 18-can packs of raw oil came from Yantai, and 150 bags of beans came from Beisha. Today's exports include 1,300 cans of raw oil to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Ease Slightly

The sugar market eased slightly yesterday due to the lack of actual sales. The public meeting price of No. 24 coarse white was 52.5 yuan in the local warehouse and 53.5 yuan in the foreign warehouse. The old goods were 52.5 yuan. The transshipment goods were a small profit of 70 cents, at 42.8 yuan. The Taikoo White was a small profit of 50 cents, the warehouse B mark was 56 yuan, the West warehouse was 56.5 yuan, the CW mark was 56 yuan, the CX mark was 55 yuan, the DY Kark was 54 yuan, and the HX mark was 53.5 yuan. The H mark cart red oil-wrapped goods were 39 yuan, the white-wrapped goods were 40 yuan, and the Dutch red was 42 yuan. The price of local cotton white was a small profit of 50 cents, No. 1 was 52.5 yuan, No. 2 was 52 yuan, No. 3 was 51.5 yuan, and No. 4 was 51 yuan. There was no reaction to local crystal sugar, and no price was opened for national sugar. A batch of Diaoqing arrived by Japanese ship, totaling 195 bags, 485 bags came from Beihai on the 13th, 80 bags from Haikou, and 70 bags from Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods: Grass Yellow Woolen Fabrics are Firm

Grass yellow and grass green woolen fabrics, such as thick and thin serge, Walterine, riding breeches, uniform cloth, military uniforms and leg wraps, etc., have recently been in demand by inland customers and those from Nanjing. Those on this street who specialize in large orders also need them. The shipments to Sichuan and Zhejiang are numerous. The market prices per yard are all one or two corners higher than usual. However, compared with the actual sales before the Republic of China 26, they have decreased by two-thirds. However, there is a large shortage of domestic products in recent years, which makes the supply and demand still balanced, so they can still rise. The output of Dalong Sheep City brand is slightly sufficient, so buyers often specify it. The opening price of No. 128 serge is 6.1 yuan per yard, No. 258 Walterine is 8.1 yuan, and the final price is Dakangming Amitabha. Grass yellow sells for 6 yuan, Yuan Canghui for 5.85 yuan, and Yihuo Yinfeng yellow riding breeches for 10.05 yuan. Zhanghua and Xiexin are both out of stock on the market. Polish-made military uniform yellow cloth is generally sold for 8.25 yuan, and the final price of the leg wrap yellow cloth is a net price of 6 yuan.

### North-South Goods: A Batch of Hao Tao Walnuts Opened, Up Another 4.5 Yuan Compared to Before

Walnuts have continued to be tight in the market recently due to few arrivals. A batch of Haozhou goods was opened, with a price of 62 yuan, up another 4.5 yuan compared to before. There was no significant change in walnut meat, and the opening price of Jinan goods was 135 yuan.

### Coal: Slack Trading of Cooked Coal

The business of cooked coal rose due to the repeated increase in the price of coal balls. However, recently, the business of cooked coal has been slack due to the establishment of a certain factory and competitive dumping of coal balls, and has had to fall accordingly, with the market price falling by five or six yuan per ton. The retail price of the stores on this street is 3.8 yuan per load for large pieces of cooked coal, and 3.4 yuan for small pieces, delivered to customers without charging delivery fees.

### From Fractional Currency to One Dollar Bills

— Dou

The first batch of fractional currency notes has been issued for a long time, but the change received when buying things is still mostly in the form of tram tickets or stamps, or cigarette cards or automobile company two- or three-cent coins with their values marked on them. The various types of voucher notes that used to circulate in large quantities have indeed decreased significantly. What the fractional currency notes have filled in is approximately a portion of the gap left by the various voucher notes. Although the second batch of fractional currency notes also amounts to 500,000, the demand in society is too great, and since it is difficult to prevent fractional currency notes from continuing to flow to the mainland, and many citizens inevitably collect and redeem them for fun, five-cent and ten-cent notes are saved up. Therefore, in reality, they are still likely to be insufficient for circulation. According to a report in this newspaper on the 11th of this month, the Central Bank's distribution of the second batch of fractional currency notes generally stipulates that each business can exchange 20 yuan. A mere 20 yuan is not enough for a large store's change for a day. For small stores, if they are willing to give it out as much as possible, it definitely won't last half a month.

The lack of fractional currency is not unique to Shanghai; it has become a widespread phenomenon. Currently, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, as well as Lanzhou, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Changshu, Kunshan, and other places are all experiencing a copper coin panic. Larger merchants in those areas, because local post offices cannot purchase large amounts of stamps, bring several to dozens of yuan worth of stamps back from Shanghai each time for use as small change. In Shanghai, people don't want stamps unless they are brand new, but in the countryside, even slightly damaged stamps are accepted, which shows that the suffering of the people in the occupied areas is deepening. (Note that copper coins are still used in areas north of the Yangtze River under the rule of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which shows where the copper coins from the occupied areas have gone.)

Many stores, out of business needs, have no choice but to purchase several yuan worth of stamps from the post office every day for change, otherwise they will be unable to maintain their operations. There are even more stores in the Central District of the International Settlement that use stamps as small change. According to rumors, the stores that give out between 30 and 50 yuan worth of brand-new stamps every day include Guanshengyuan, Wing On Company's Tianyunlou, Hu Qing Yu Tang, and Xue Ji, among others. Those that give out around 10 yuan worth of new stamps every day include Wufuzhai, Xinya Hotel, Huizhong Hotel, Sino-French Pharmacy, Shilu Fengtai, Liang Lianji Restaurant, and Dasanyuan Restaurant. Those that give out around 5 yuan worth of new stamps every day include Taoyuan Restaurant, Quanxingkang, Dasamsung, Yanhualou, Huimanji, Qingyise Restaurant, Xin'an Company, Yu Yonghe Silver Shop, Shurentang, Darentang, Zhengjia Muqiao Afu Pavilion, Hehexing Rib Noodles, and Daguangming Cinema, among others. In addition, those that buy new stamps for one or two yuan or more per day include Qutainbao, One-Corner Store, Xiangya Company, China National Products Company, Little Luzon, Nanyang Socks Factory, Nanhua Socks Factory, Huahua Socks Factory, Wang Sanhe Restaurant, Fulu Shou, Ruikang Watch Shop, Yongyuan Hardware Store, Hu Kaiwen, Guangrongtai Hardware Store, and several pawnshops and sauce shops, the number of which is countless. Of course, the numbers of stamps mentioned above fluctuate from time to time. This is just a comparison based on hearsay!

The problem of fractional currency has not been completely resolved, and the phenomenon of a shortage of one-dollar bills and corner notes on the market has occurred again. Among the corner notes, one-corner bills are particularly scarce. In recent days, it has often been seen that many cigarette shops and some busy hotels and businesses are searching everywhere for one-dollar bills and single and double corner notes, causing the premium on corner notes to rise to between 10 and 15 yuan per thousand. Now that the end of the year is approaching, if this phenomenon continues and cannot be corrected, the future is extremely worrying. The reason for the shortage of corner notes and one-dollar bills is nothing more than two reasons: one is that there are no financial regulatory bank organizations in the occupied areas, and all the single notes and corner notes in Shanghai are being taken away in large quantities by various merchants; the other is that it is obvious that someone is manipulating them for profit. This problem is neither big nor small. Currently, it is still in its early stages. If it becomes more serious day by day, and the disease worsens and breaks out, it is very likely that the corner notes and one-dollar bills on the market will suddenly disappear without a trace, just like the copper coins before. The suffering at that time would be even deeper than the fractional currency panic, so I hope everyone in society pays attention to it. This is still just a precaution!

### British Troop Adjustment in North China Unrelated to Far East Policy, By No Means a Preliminary Abandonment of Interests in North China, Japanese Interpretation Entirely One-Sided

Yesterday morning, according to foreign news agencies in London and Amsterdam, the British War Office announced that the government had decided to withdraw British troops stationed in North China, leaving only a few necessary troops to protect the safety and property of British citizens and maintain order. Chinese and foreign figures in Shanghai paid close attention to the news of the withdrawal of British troops from North China because at the beginning of the outbreak of the European war, the Japanese government, on the grounds of its "non-interference" in the European war, requested that the countries participating in the European war withdraw their troops stationed in the areas occupied by the Japanese army in China. Moreover, foreign observers here also believe that one of the two battalions of the British Defense Force currently stationed in Shanghai may also be withdrawn, and rumors from the outside world have become increasingly confusing.

Shanghai Not Affected

Last night, it was learned from reliable sources that the British military headquarters in Shanghai had not received any official notification regarding the British government's decision to withdraw British troops from North China. The British government's decision mentioned in various telegrams all clearly stated North China and did not involve other places. Therefore, the interpretation here is that Shanghai will not be affected. As for the Japanese side's observation, it is believed that this decision by the British is the initial action to finally abandon all interests in North China. British business circles here expressed doubts. According to a British tycoon in Shanghai and a member of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, he told reporters that those who believe that Britain will abandon its interests in North China can be called a "foolish prophecy."

London Telegram, Withdrawal of Some Troops

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that a telegram from London today (the 13th) announced that the British War Office had decided to withdraw some of the British troops stationed in North China. Observers in this city believe that this news means that one of the two British battalions stationed in Shanghai will be withdrawn, leaving two British battalions stationed in Tianjin and Shanghai. The British troops stationed in North China, in addition to the auxiliary team, also have three major teams: the Bao Han Light Infantry Team stationed in Tianjin, the West Fu Zi Highlands Team and the Dong Xu Lai Team stationed in Shanghai. It has been several years since the British army stationed in Shanghai had only one battalion. However, in the event of an accident, British troops are transferred from other areas to Shanghai for reinforcement, reaching three battalions. Currently, the Dong Xu Lai Team was originally stationed in Shanghai, while the West Fu Zi Team was transferred from Hong Kong to Shanghai. If the current war had not broken out, the West Fu Zi Team would now be replaced by the Highlands Light Infantry Team, and the one that is about to withdraw from Shanghai may be the West Fu Zi Team. However, no detailed report has yet been obtained from the British military headquarters in Shanghai.

Japanese Side Expresses Unique Views

The spokesman for the Japanese Army in Shanghai stated at the press conference last night in response to reporters' inquiries, "The British withdrawal of its troops stationed in North China is obviously because they believe that the lives and property of British nationals in that area can be protected by the Japanese Army." The reporter asked, "According to a telegram from Amsterdam, this move by the British is the result of Japanese pressure. What is your opinion?" He replied, "I do not believe that it is affected by any pressure." The spokesman for the Japanese Embassy continued to state, completely agreeing with this view, and said, "I believe that if the British government did not fully trust that the lives, property, and interests of British nationals could be safely guaranteed by the Japanese army, it would not have taken this step even if the European war broke out." The reporter asked, "Will this move by the British government promote the relationship between Britain and Japan in North China?" He replied, "This is not directly related to the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin, but the resolution of various local pending issues in Tianjin will help solve part of the blockade problem." The spokesman for the Japanese Embassy continued, "According to my personal belief, the Tianjin British Concession issue can be resolved soon, but no one can predict how the future situation will encounter."

### Remittance System Effective, Circulation Increasing

After the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association handled the issuance of inter-bank remittances for member banks and firms, each bank and firm provided collateral and applied to the Joint Bank Reserve Committee for issuance to the market, which is convenient for all industries. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Bankers' Association, and the Banking and Money Industry Association jointly formed a Remittance Reserve Inspection Committee to conduct inspections to demonstrate great trust. As of the end of September, the total appraised value of inter-bank remittance collateral deposited by various banks and firms was 39,728,680 yuan and 3 jiao. The total amount of inter-bank remittances approved for issuance was 23,063,000 yuan. Regarding the deposit of inter-bank remittance collateral by various banks and firms as of the end of October, the Inspection Committee Chairman Xu Jilou has sent personnel to start the inspection, which is expected to be completed within this week. The fourth meeting of the Inspection Committee will be held at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, the 20th of this month, and the inspection report will be announced after it is approved.

### A Young Man Assassinated at the Intersection of East Zilaihuo Street Last Night, The Deceased Shao Fanjiu Was a Lawyer's Assistant, Rumored to Have Some Relationship with a Certain Organization

At around 8 o'clock last night, a shooting occurred at the intersection of East Zilaihuo Street and Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. A young man was shot four times and died immediately. The details are recorded below.

Gunshots Erupt, Young Man Falls to the Ground

At 8:35 last night, four consecutive gunshots suddenly erupted at the entrance of the Xixing Hotel at No. 377 East Zilaihuo Street (i.e., the intersection of Avenue Edward VII) in the French Concession. At that time, four or five Chinese and Russian detectives from the French Concession were checking pedestrians at the Dahud Hotel, which was less than a hundred yards to the east. When they heard the gunshots, they rushed to the scene and saw a young man had fallen to the ground in response.

Young Man Standing Aside, Panicked

The young man was about thirty years old, wearing a black Zhongshan suit, with his head facing west and his feet facing east, lying in the middle of the road in front of the Xixing Hotel. A total of four shots hit his head and waist. There was also a young man of about twenty years old wearing a khaki-colored suit standing aside, looking stunned. At that time, the Chinese and Russian detectives split up to pursue, but it was too late, and the murderer had already escaped without a trace. The detectives immediately reported to the police station and sent detectives to investigate.

The Injured Dies, Named Shao Fanjiu

However, by the time the detectives from the police station arrived, the injured man had already died. They then took the young man in the suit standing aside to the police station and took the body to the morgue for examination. It was reported that the young man in the suit claimed that the deceased was named Shao Fanjiu, a local, over thirty years old, and currently working as an assistant at Chen Jipeng's law firm, residing at No. 5 Jiande Village, Xuzhen Road, Xujiahui.

Dinner Together, Neighboring Table Spying

The young man continued, "He and the deceased were good friends. Tonight (last night) at around 7 o'clock, he, the deceased, and a friend went to the Lao Guangdong Restaurant at No. 363 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession for dinner. After eating, they went out together and were walking east when they arrived at the intersection of East Zilaihuo Street, when a thug rushed up and fired four shots at the deceased, all hitting vital points." However, when they were dining at Lao Guangdong, there were four people in suits at the neighboring table. When the three of them left the restaurant, the four people at the neighboring table also followed them out.

Cause of Death, Politically Related

After the incident, according to rumors, the deceased's maternal uncle was named Tao Yishan, who is now working in Chongqing, while the deceased, Shao Fanjiu, is now working for an organization in Shanghai. This sudden misfortune may be related to politics.

### Yesterday's Commemoration of the Fall of Songhu and Chongqing, Citizens' Emotions Solemn, Lying in Wait, Accumulating Strength, Teaching Lessons, Diligently Encouraging Themselves, Supporting National Policy

Yesterday was the second anniversary of the fall of Songhu and Chongqing. The people of Shanghai unanimously commemorated it with grief. Patriotic leaflets were found everywhere. The concession authorities implemented the usual precautions. The whole day passed peacefully in a calm and solemn atmosphere. The details are as follows:

Patriotic Leaflets Found Everywhere

Yesterday, patriotic leaflets were found in Daxin Street, Avenue Edward VII, and other places, posted on utility poles. The names on them were the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League and the Jiangnan Guerrilla Force of the Loyal National Salvation Army, etc. The content was a letter to the citizens of the isolated island, saying that due to the special environment since the fall of the isolated island, this sacred anniversary cannot be commemorated in form. However, we cannot forget it because of this. We should be diligent and self-motivated, unite as one, support the central government's national policy, overthrow traitorous acts, not seek peace, not compromise, implement the National Covenant, and strive to achieve the goal of winning the war and building the country.

Concession Precautions, All Day Peaceful

The police authorities of the two concessions, considering that yesterday was the anniversary of the fall of Songhu and Chongqing, continued to implement the usual precautions. Patrolmen were added to all roads, patrolling back and forth and searching pedestrians. The French Concession also dispatched armored vehicles to guard each road and implement security. The whole day passed peacefully in a calm and solemn atmosphere. In addition, the Japanese side took strict precautions yesterday. Japanese troops and puppet police were added to Pudong, Zhabei, Nanshi, and the suburbs. The bridges along the Suzhou River were especially heavily guarded. Pedestrians were subjected to harsh searches.

### Italian Troops Relieving

New Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai on Italian Mail Ship, Mail Ships to Europe Scheduled to Depart

The fast Italian Mail Company Euro-Asia route mail ships Conte Verde and Conte Rosso, after returning from Shanghai to Venice between June and July of this year, entered the dry dock for repairs. After the work was completed, they were about to resume sailing, but suddenly the European war broke out. At that time, because the Italian government's attitude was unclear, they were notified to continue to suspend sailing. In the middle of last month, after the Italian government's attitude was clarified, the company resumed the sailing of the two ships. The Conte Verde first departed from Venice on the 17th of last month and arrived in Shanghai via the original route. It is scheduled to enter the port at 2:00 p.m. today and dock at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou. The ship has 364 passengers, including an Italian army team of about 110 people, who are said to be relieving a certain Italian army team stationed in this city. In addition to the Italian army sending a small transport to greet them, the passengers will be landed at the Customs House Wharf by the company's prepared passenger ferries at about 3:30 p.m. today. The large ship will stay in Shanghai for three days and is scheduled to return to Europe from Shanghai on the 17th. The Conte Rosso has also departed and is en route, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 28th. In addition, the British Company's Euro-Asia route mail ship Puteng arrived in Shanghai on the 16th of last month and went to Japan on the 18th. It has now returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 12th) and is docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. After loading cargo in Shanghai, it is scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning and return to London. The Sumanli arrived in Shanghai on the 6th of this month and is also docked at the Gongchang Wharf in Pudong, without going to Japan. It is still staying in Shanghai. It is said that it will have to return to Europe on the 24th. The new steamship Yizhizhajiaga of the Java Mail Company arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Surabaya via Nanyang and Hong Kong and Xiamen, and entered the port at 2:40 p.m., docking at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. The ship had more than 440 passengers on this trip to Shanghai. After arriving at the port, they changed to the company's prepared passenger ferries and landed at the Customs House Wharf at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. The mail ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Xiamen and Hong Kong on the 16th, and return to Surabaya via the original route through Nanyang.

### Mr. Shi Liangcai, The Fifth Anniversary of His Death, Colleagues of This Newspaper Held a Memorial Meeting Yesterday

Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the death of Mr. Shi Liangcai, the former General Manager of this newspaper.

The second batch of 500,000 yuan, printed by the American firm Yongning Company, has been delivered to the Central Bank in batches in accordance with the contract. It is said that the bank will issue it as soon as it is ready, and the Shanghai branch will continue to issue it within this week. The issuance method has been improved, and various industry associations will be entrusted to distribute it in order to promote universal circulation. As for whether to continue printing the third batch, the decision will be made based on whether the market needs it again.

### The Puppet Government's Proposed Counter-Proposal for Western Shanghai, The Municipal Council Is Seriously Considering It in Part, First the British and American Directors Will Study the Content, Formal Reply Will Take More Than a Week

Regarding the negotiation of road construction beyond the border, the puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiaowan visited Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the Municipal Council, at 5:30 p.m. on the 11th and submitted a "counter-proposal." As for the content, due to the agreement between the two parties to strictly maintain secrecy, it will not be published for the time being. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Mr. Fessenden, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, who said that the Municipal Council will decide its attitude after the Municipal Council holds a meeting regarding the "counter-proposal" submitted by the puppet mayor. Mr. Fessenden refused to make any statement on the "counter-proposal" submitted by Chuan Xiaowan other than making this statement. Mr. Fessenden only said that he could not make any comments on the content of Mr. Chuan's "counter-proposal" at the moment because both parties hope that an agreement can be reached on the issue of road construction beyond the border as soon as possible. General speculation is that the Municipal Council will convene a meeting of directors to discuss it. According to reliable sources obtained by a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, the "meeting" mentioned by Mr. Fessenden refers to an informal meeting between the British and American countries. The Municipal Council has decided to submit the puppet municipal government's counter-proposal to the British and American directors for research first, and then convene a meeting of the directors of the two countries before deciding on the attitude to take. Therefore, the Municipal Council's reply to the "counter-proposal" will take at least a week before it can be sent out.

Puppet Police Sub-Bureau Moves to Border Area

The huge building at No. 11 Jisi Feiai Road (Avenue Haig), originally the Sheng Family Ancestral Hall, was borrowed by the Cilian Branch after the August 13th Shanghai War and used as the site of the 31st Refugee Shelter. A large number of refugees lived there. On the afternoon of September 9, it was suddenly invaded by Japanese and puppet military police, who occupied the staff room on the ground floor of the shelter and two large rooms of the refugee dormitory for use as puppet police offices and set up sentry posts and defensive works at the entrance. However, the refugees in the shelter still lived in a part of the building, and the two bamboo huts built on the open space in the building as the school buildings for the children's middle school were still maintained as usual. This situation was maintained for nearly two months. Recently, the puppet police forced all the refugees out of the shelter, and the children's middle school was also forced to close and announced its dissolution. Until yesterday, the "Shanghai West Police Sub-Bureau" of the puppet "Municipal Government Police Bureau" officially moved from its original address at No. 2 Kaina Road to No. 11 Jisi Feiai Road. General observation is that the relocation of the Shanghai West Puppet Police Station to the above-mentioned new address has its own important significance. It is because that place is adjacent to the concession area and is at the throat of road construction beyond the border. At a time when negotiations on the issue of road construction beyond the border are underway, its actions are even more worthy of attention.

Armed Chinese Not Yet Released

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that sixteen armed Chinese in military uniform who were arrested by British soldiers on Sunday were still being detained by the British army because no one came to claim them. The British army could not find their master. It is reported that these people encountered a British army patrol at the intersection of Triumph Road and Baireinan Road at 7:00 a.m. on Sunday and were arrested because they were carrying rifles, pistols, and even hand grenades and walking along the concession road. These people were wearing the green uniforms of the "Self-Defense Group" of the "Reformed Nationalist Party," which are different from the uniforms of the Great Road Police. The "Self-Defense Group" to which they belong is one of the many groups currently in western Shanghai. The hometown of these sixteen people is not Shanghai. According to one of them, they are from inland Pudong. The British army is now detaining them and providing them with food, waiting for their master to come and claim them.

Puppet Police Beat Up, Car Ticket Check

At 1:20 p.m. yesterday, a public bus of the China Public Bus Company was traveling from east to west along Avenue Haig. A Chinese passenger on the bus refused to buy a ticket, showed the ticket seller his so-called "badge," and even claimed, "I have never bought a ticket when taking a public bus. One day I will be the boss of the company." The company's Russian ticket checker No. 36 intervened. At that time, when the vehicle drove to the opposite side of the Diamond Shop in Dairmond, the passenger summoned the puppet police who had invaded the guard post on the road built beyond the border, dragged the Russian ticket checker down and beat him up, and used the butt of a rifle to destroy the edge of the public bus.

### Released Portuguese Ships, Portuguese Consulate No Longer Protects, Registration Certificates of Each Ship Canceled, Content Extremely Complicated, Still Problems

The Japanese naval authorities have detained more than ten Portuguese merchant ships since April 8th of this year. After repeated unsuccessful negotiations by the Portuguese Consulate, the Portuguese merchants' Atlantic Hailong and the gasoline sailboat Lude · Baode · Dade, as well as seven ships of the Huamei Shipping Company, Tang Qiao, Tang Lu, and Tang Bei, were actually claimed by someone posing as the shipowner, admitting that each ship belonged to Chinese merchants and willing to register with the puppet "Shipping Bureau," so they were returned by the Japanese naval authorities one after another. However, each shipping company had not contacted them in advance. After inquiring with Portugal, they learned the inside story. According to a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency who learned from the shipping industry, the Portuguese Consulate stated that because the released Portuguese ships had been admitted to be owned by Chinese merchants and registered with the puppet "Shipping Bureau," the registration of each ship had been canceled, and the Portuguese Consulate would no longer be responsible for the protection of everything related to the ships in the future. According to another reporter from the Da Guang News Agency, after the three Portuguese ships Tang Lu, Tang Qiao, and Tang Bei, which were represented by the American firm Huamei Shipping Company, were returned by the Japanese side on the 4th of this month, the person claiming to be the shipowner's representative actually planned to form a new company and continue to operate. All the employees who had been sent by the company to watch the ship were driven ashore and new workers were recruited to board the ship. However, the Huamei Shipping Company, due to the relationship of the deposit, decided to deal with it through legal procedures. Therefore, the content of each ship is complicated, and whether it can set sail is still a major issue.

### The Improving Trend of Foreign Trade: Customs Statistics Confirm Widespread Increase in Exports of Local Products, and Reduction in Tianjin Customs' Imports

After adjustments, China's foreign trade has seen a surge in exports, a sharp decrease in imports, and a reduction in trade deficits. The Trade Commission's full efforts to promote the export of local products have shielded it from the effects of the Sino-Japanese War and the outbreak of the European War. As a result, foreign exchange reserves are increasing, and the black market value of the legal tender is soaring. The details are as follows:

**Significant Increase in Exports of Chinese Local Products**

Regarding the export of local products, the figures for the first, second, and third quarters of this year were 67,778,769 yuan, an increase of 11,789,2022 yuan compared to the same period last year. Exports of local products to the United States amounted to 12,266,600 yuan, an increase of 6,344,800 yuan compared to the same period last year. Exports of local products to Hong Kong amounted to 15,170,090 yuan, a decrease of 3,771,100 yuan compared to the same period last year. Exports of local products to Japan amounted to 4,763,200 yuan, a decrease of 4,327,300 yuan compared to the same period last year. Exports of local products to the United Kingdom amounted to 6,369,800 yuan, an increase of 2,389,900 yuan compared to the same period last year. Exports of local products to Annam amounted to 4,460,020 yuan, an increase of 3,374,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. Exports of local products to France amounted to 2,562,800 yuan, an increase of 1,133,700 yuan compared to the same period last year.

**Decline in Dumping of Japanese Goods**

Regarding the import of foreign goods, after the Ministry of Finance issued measures to prohibit the import of goods, all luxury and non-essential items were not allowed to be imported or re-exported to non-occupied areas. The import of foreign goods in the first, second, and third quarters of this year was 100,617,315.64 yuan. Although this was an increase compared to the same period last year, it was due to the dumping of Japanese goods in the occupied areas. For example, imports of Japanese goods amounted to 24,553,000 yuan, an increase of 11,633,400 yuan compared to the same period last year. The total value of foreign goods imported from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France was 23,060,010 yuan, a decrease of 3,764,300 yuan compared to the same period last year. However, since September of this year, the import of foreign goods has sharply decreased to 93,781,000 yuan, a decrease of 3,661,000 yuan compared to August, and a decrease of 2,309,300 yuan compared to July. This is due to the government's prohibition of the import of foreign goods.

**Trade Improvement: A Comparison of Past and Present**

After the improvement of foreign trade, all customs in non-occupied areas, such as Mengzi, Simao, Tengyue, Longzhou, Beihai, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Wuzhou, have shifted to trade surpluses. In the first, second, and third quarters of this year, twelve customs collectively had a trade surplus of 51,947,000 yuan. The customs with trade deficits included Shanghai, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Yantai, Jiaozhou, Longkou, and Weihaiwei, with Shanghai, Tianjin, and Jiaozhou having the largest deficits. Although the government has made every effort to eliminate trade deficits, it is generally due to the occupation of these areas, which limits the government's power. The import of Japanese goods through these customs and their dumping in the occupied areas cannot be prohibited. However, since September, the Shanghai customs, which had previously held the top position in trade deficits, suddenly shifted to a trade surplus, with a surplus of 17,374,353 yuan. The trade deficit in Tianjin customs has also decreased from 22,738,000 yuan in August to 10,118,000 yuan. This confirms that China's foreign trade has indeed improved.

### Artillery Battles in Longhua and Xinzhuang

**Japanese Casualties Being Transported to Shanghai Yesterday; Japanese Military's Actions Show Obvious Tension**

Since the Chinese guerrilla forces launched attacks in the Longhua and Xinzhuang areas, the fighting has been extremely fierce. Large numbers of Japanese troops from Shanghai and Songjiang have been dispatched to reinforce the area. Artillery battles are still ongoing every night. Yesterday morning, around 8:30 AM, three Japanese Red Cross ambulances drove along the highway from the southern city to the area. Around 5:00 PM in the afternoon, two trucks carrying dead and wounded Japanese soldiers, covered with white tarpaulins and estimated to hold sixty or seventy people, passed through Min'guo Road to the 16th Pier and were transferred to small boats for transport to rear hospitals in Hongkou for treatment.

**Japanese Troops Forcibly Conscripting Laborers in Hongkou**

Due to the emergency on various front lines, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces stationed in Hongkou have reinforced the front lines. According to a person in Hongkou speaking to a Dagong News Agency reporter yesterday, the Japanese troops in Hongkou conscripted laborers on the two days prior to transport military supplies for the Japanese army or directly escort them to various occupied areas, reaching over six hundred people. These conscripted Chinese people were all poorly dressed, impoverished workers or passersby. Regardless of whether they had permits or were residents of Hongkou, they were forcibly taken away. No one knows where they were being sent to.

**Japanese Military Strengthening Security at Floating Restaurant**

The floating restaurant near the Bund Park in the Huangpu River has been occupied by a team dispatched by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters since the withdrawal of the national army to the west. The Japanese army considers suspected criminals both north and south of the Huangpu River, and escorts them to the team for interrogation. Yesterday, the Japanese military police at the location even added two or three sentries outside the restaurant, with bayonets fixed on their rifles, pacing back and forth. Pedestrians have disappeared along the Bund, and passage is prohibited at night. It is heard that many people were arrested by the Japanese army from ships and boats and taken to the restaurant for questioning yesterday.

### Temporary Business Registration in Shanghai

The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently approved the temporary registration of commercial firms and factories in the Shanghai market, including Guowei Arts and Crafts Factory, Weida Cotton Weaving Factory, Jincheng Thermos Factory, Huacheng Canvas Factory, Su Cun German Leaf Company, and Ye Shude Hall Traditional Chinese Medicine Company, totaling fifteen companies. Their business scope, capital amount, names and addresses of the principal or partners, and locations have been announced by the Ministry in the 10th issue of the 19th volume of the Commercial Monthly Report published by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.

### German僑s in Shanghai Rush to Withdraw Funds from the Dutch Bank; Withdrawals Reach 1.5 Million in One Day; German 僑s Act on Instructions from the German Consulate

Since the outbreak of the European War, the Netherlands has declared strict neutrality. However, the recent stalemate on the Western Front has led Germany to demand the establishment of an air force base on the Dutch North Sea coast to be closer to London and facilitate German air force operations. However, this demand has been rejected by the Dutch government. As a result, German troops have recently concentrated in large numbers on the Dutch border, attempting to undermine the country's neutrality. In preparation for any eventuality, the Netherlands is now actively deploying defenses. Relations between the Netherlands and Germany have reached a state of extreme tension. According to confirmed information obtained by a Dagong News Agency reporter from the banking sector, when the European War broke out, German merchants who had savings in British banks such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank rushed to withdraw their funds and deposit them in the Dutch-owned Hollandsche Bank aan de Zuidafrikaansche Republiek, located in the Sassoon House on the Bund, totaling approximately 2 million yuan. Since the deterioration of relations between the Netherlands and Germany, German僑s suddenly rushed to withdraw their deposits from the Hollandsche Bank on the 11th, with withdrawals totaling 1.5 million yuan in one day. It is heard that the German僑s acted on instructions from the German Consulate in Shanghai, suggesting that Germany's determination to invade the Netherlands is imminent.

### Nine Years of Marriage Suddenly Shattered; Husband and Wife Face Each Other in Court; Wife Petitions for Divorce and Asks for Alimony and Other Expenses; Defendant Claims Cohabitation; Summons Issued for Mediator to be Questioned

Wu Jiduan, a native of Wuxi, owner of the United Iron Works at 130, Lane 87, Connaught Road, Public Concession, is 40 years old this year. Through a matchmaker, he married Chen Guiying, a fellow villager (31 years old this year), at Jitae Restaurant in Wuxi. They have been married for nine years, and the relationship between the couple was relatively harmonious. In recent years, however, Wu has become entangled in an inextricable relationship with his niece, leading to

**Discord Between Husband and Wife**

Recently, Chen Guiying hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Li Gengxiang, Yang Yunshi, and Ge Bangren to file a civil lawsuit petitioning for divorce. The petition stated that the plaintiff, Chen Guiying, married the defendant, Wu Jiduan, on July 24, 1931, through a matchmaker, and they had a son and a daughter. The son's name is Dongping, nine years old this year, and the daughter's name is Xiaoying, seven years old this year. The relationship between the couple was initially harmonious, but who would have known that the defendant's attitude suddenly changed, and he began to

**Subject the Plaintiff to Abuse**

On July 25 of this year, the defendant suddenly injured the plaintiff all over her body, which was reported to the police station. The plaintiff, considering the future happiness of her children, did not want to pursue the matter deeply, hoping that the defendant would repent and their good dream could be restored. However, the defendant not only did not repent but became even worse, even refusing to provide food and driving her out of the house. Now the plaintiff has discovered that the defendant is

**Having an Affair with His Niece**

and has evidence to prove it. Only then did she realize the reason for being resented. Such immoral and scandalous behavior has completely severed their relationship. As for the children they had, the defendant, who does not restrain himself, should, for the benefit of the children, be placed in the plaintiff's custody and care. The expenses for their marriage and education are estimated to be 1,000 yuan each. The defendant should also be responsible for paying. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1052, Paragraph 1, of the Civil Code, the proviso in the latter part of Article 1051 of the same law, and Article 1056 of the same law, the plaintiff petitions the court to swiftly

**Issue a Summons for Questioning**

and rule (1) that the divorce between the two parties be granted, (2) that the defendant should pay the plaintiff alimony of 6,000 yuan, (3) that the children be placed in the plaintiff's custody, (4) that the plaintiff should pay the children's education expenses of 1,000 yuan each, (5) that the litigation costs be borne by the defendant, etc. Upon receiving the petition, the court, yesterday, instructed Judge Gui Yu to convene the third court for questioning. The plaintiff was represented by lawyers Yang Yunshi and Ge Bangren, who stated the intent of the lawsuit. The defendant, Wu Jiduan, claimed that he and the plaintiff were cohabiting and opposed the divorce, saying that the plaintiff fabricated the facts and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The court verified the statements and decided to reschedule the hearing and summon the matchmaker to court for further questioning.

### Tragic Incident in the Huangpu River Yesterday Morning; Japanese Motorboat Violently Collides with Ferry; Over Sixty People Drowned; More Than Thirty Male and Female Bodies Retrieved

There was a ferry crossing with civilian ferries at the Lingjia Mu Bridge ferry in the west of Yangjing Town, Pudong, before the war. The ferry crossing on the opposite bank was at the Lanlu Wharf. Civilian ferries were suspended for a long time after the war until they resumed last year. Because Yangshupu Lanlu was within the cordon line, the ferry crossing was moved to Qiqihar Road. Passengers crossing the river are mostly female workers from the Yangshupu yarn factory and vegetable vendors. Around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, a ferry boat owned by a local man named Zhu Jinbiao (a "wharf boat", larger than ordinary ferries) loaded over a hundred vegetable vendors and female workers at the Lingjia Mu Bridge in Pudong. While rowing to the center of the river, a wooden, pointed-headed Japanese motorboat suddenly sped downstream from the pseudo-"fish market" wharf on Qiwu Pu Road in the west. It collided with Zhu's ferry boat. The motorboat was traveling at a very high speed. Zhu's boat was unable to avoid it, and the front of the port side of the boat was violently hit and split into two sections. The boat immediately flooded and sank. Over a hundred passengers and the boat sank into the water at the same time. A young woman's abdomen was broken by the impact, and her internal organs flowed out. She died in the river. Another vegetable vendor named Jia Abao (from Jiajiajiao) was proficient in swimming. He grabbed onto the Japanese motorboat with both hands, but was pushed into the river and killed by Japanese soldiers with iron poles. The river surface was filled with weeping and crying. Neighboring boats rushed to the rescue. Due to the rapid current and high waves, only over fifty people were rescued on the spot. Over sixty men and women are still missing. After the incident, the Japanese motorboat continued to speed downstream. The customs water patrol and various boatmen rushed to salvage the bodies. As of yesterday evening, a total of six or seven male bodies, over twenty female bodies, and four or five children's bodies had been recovered and placed on the bank of the Lingjia Mu Bridge. Family members gathered on the riverbank weeping in pain. It was a heartbreaking sight. Over thirty bodies are still drifting and their whereabouts are unknown.

### Gang Fight Near Yangtze Hotel; One Passerby Shot and Injured

Yesterday afternoon at 6:45 PM, a large gang fight suddenly broke out near the Yangtze Hotel at Yunnan Road, Sanma Road. The police received a report and dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress the fight. While the gangsters were still gathering, someone fired a shot. The bullet hit Chen Axi (36 years old, Shanghai resident), a passerby, in the left leg. He was injured and fell to the ground. No. 441 personnel sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that his leg bone has been broken and he may be disabled. The gangsters, seeing that they had caused trouble, dispersed and fled without a trace.

### Li Miaoquan and Wife Convicted of Assaulting Older Sister

Li Miaoquan, a native of Tongzhou residing at No. 4, North Henan Road, went to his house around 6:00 PM on October 8th when his older sister, Zhu Li, came to his house to demand the repayment of 57 yuan owed, leading to an argument. Li Miaoquan instead violently kicked and punched his sister, injuring her abdomen. Mrs. Zhu was six months pregnant and injured. After the incident, the patrol from the Huisi Police Station arrested Li, along with his wife, Wang, and Chen Lianqi, a fellow Tongzhou native involved in the joint assault. They were all escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng, the presiding judge, opened the third criminal court for further interrogation. Attorney Li Zhishan from the police station filed a charge of aggravated assault. The victim, Zhu Li, sick and accompanied by her representative lawyer, Ma Junshuo, appeared in court. Regarding the private prosecution, she demanded compensation for medical expenses and all recuperation costs. Judge Huang interrogated the three defendants and sentenced Li Miaoquan to three months imprisonment, Li Wang to two months imprisonment, with a three-year reprieve, and Chen Lianqi was acquitted for lack of evidence of aiding and abetting the assault. Li Miaoquan was ordered to compensate his older sister, Zhu Li, 150 yuan for medical and other expenses.

### Refugee Factory Director and Deputy Director Accused of Illegal Detention; Detaining Refugee Women and Forcing Them to Work; Court Rules Defendants Not Guilty After Hearing

Han Yuqi, director, and Ma Rugen, deputy director and chief of the administrative section, of the refugee relief committee affiliated with the Zhen Dan Jin Li Yang Five Counties Association were recently sued by Jiangbei women Ma Sufang and Zhu Shuying, residents of Wanyuanxing Sesame Oil Store Building, No. 3, Xinxin Street, Dapu Bridge, who jointly hired lawyer Cheng Qian and submitted a petition to the criminal court of the First Special Court, accusing them of

**Illegal Detention**

and unlawfully restricting their freedom. They requested that they be punished according to the law and included a civil lawsuit. The reasons for the lawsuit were as follows: The plaintiffs were displaced by the August 13th Incident and had been living in the shelter of the Zhen Dan Jin Li Yang Five Counties Association Refugee Relief Committee for more than a year. Later, they were introduced by the organizers of the shelter to work at the Shenxin Textile Factory No. 9, working diligently and earning a monthly salary of more than 20 yuan. Now, the association has organized a refugee factory specifically for the production of products by refugees, which is a very good intention. However, the factory has recently been organized and is

**Lacking Skilled Labor**

Weavers. Factory director Han Jingqi and others insisted that the plaintiffs go to work at the refugee factory. The plaintiffs had just settled down since starting work at Factory No. 9 and did not want to go. However, the defendants used cruel tactics, forcibly moving all of the plaintiffs' belongings to the refugee factory and canceling the plaintiffs' work names at Factory No. 9. On October 25th at 1:00 PM, they privately arrested them and detained them in an open-air alley at the refugee factory, assigning two people to guard them with wooden sticks in rotation, cutting off their food and drink. At 9:00 PM that night, they were moved upstairs and detained. Later, the plaintiffs wanted to relieve themselves and

**Seized the Opportunity to Escape**

It is found that the defendants are the director and deputy director of the refugee factory, and should have compassion, lead the refugees, and should not rely on their power to bully people and deprive them of their freedom of movement. They have committed a crime under Article 302 of the Criminal Code, and have included a civil lawsuit requesting that the belongings that have been moved be returned. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Peishen took the seat in the second criminal court for hearing. The defendants also arrived with their lawyer, Ma Nangeng. The plaintiffs, Ma Sufang and Zhu Shuying, successively submitted their cases and explained the situation. When questioned, the defendants claimed that the plaintiffs were previously in the refugee shelter and they introduced them to

**Shenxin Factory No. 9**

to work, with a monthly salary of 12 yuan. The purpose of the introduction at the time was for them to practice and learn so that they would still return after becoming skilled to teach novice workers, and a voluntary letter was written. Now that our shelter has established its own refugee factory, which officially started work on October 22nd, we sent a letter to Shenxin Factory No. 9 to transfer the plaintiffs back, with a monthly salary of 12 yuan. The plaintiffs' lawsuit to your court is obviously for other purposes and is being instigated by someone. The allegations are completely untrue and should be investigated thoroughly. Judge Xiao verified the statements and ruled that the defendants Han Jingqi and Ma Rugen were not guilty.

### Great Fire at Crown Alley, Near Bauliu Ground; Continued Questioning; Total of Eleven Injured

### Chinese Buddhist Association Expresses Uncertainty; Circularity About Yuan Ying's Whereabouts

It is Rumored That His Whereabouts Are Uncertain; One Explanation Regarding the Contents of Fundraising

Master Yuan Ying, Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, has been missing for two and a half weeks since being taken away from Yuanming Lecture Hall on Daxi Road on the 19th of last month. His whereabouts are extremely unclear. The incident has greatly shocked Buddhists across the country and has drawn significant attention. A reporter from the Datong News Agency visited the Chinese Buddhist Association at No. 418 Hede Road yesterday morning and was received by Mr. Hu. According to him, Master Yuan Ying had originally planned to return to Southeast Asia after spending the Mid-Autumn Festival in Shanghai this year, after returning from Southeast Asia in July. This unfortunate event is truly unfortunate. Although there are many rumors about his whereabouts, they are all speculation. To date, the association has not received any reliable information about his whereabouts. Mr. Hu continued to defend Yuan Ying on the issue of fundraising in Southeast Asia, saying that Yuan Ying raised a total of over 70,000 yuan in Southeast Asia. The rumor of raising over one million yuan is completely unfounded. The funds were used for expenses such as the monks' burial team, the monks' rescue team, and assisting refugee children's organizations in Hong Kong, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. The distribution of the above funds was said to have been approved by the assistance committee organized by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia.

### Zhou Yunqing Suffers a Miserable Defeat; Accomplices to Be Punished

The gangster Zhang Longshan, having a grudge against Zhou Yunqing, who worked at the dock, gathered a gang including Peng Changsheng, Zhao Jicai, Yin Mingzhou, and Liu Jiabao on July 13th of this year around 2 PM. Armed with iron hooks and sharp knives, they ambushed Zhou Yunqing in front of the Taichangxiang warehouse at No. 3 The Bund. Zhou was injured and fell to the ground under the barrage of iron hooks and knives, dying before he could be rescued. After the incident, the mastermind Zhang Longshan was arrested by the French Concession police and sentenced to a heavy penalty by the Second Special Court's Criminal Division. Peng Changsheng, Zhao Jicai, Liu Jiabao, and Yin Mingzhou were also successively apprehended. The French police transferred the newly arrested accomplices to the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, prosecuting them for murder. The defendants hired lawyer Zhang Danping to defend them. After repeated trials by Judge Sun Penghan, the case was concluded. Yesterday, Peng Changsheng, Zhao Jicai, Yin Mingzhou, and Liu Jiabao were sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment each for jointly harming another person's body.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Esteemed Editor:

I read the news item "Pro-Japanese Banquets Must Be Reported" in today's newspaper, which stated that the Yuli Restaurant was suspended from business for a week because it had not complied with the Municipal Council's regulations by reporting a banquet in advance, and further mentioned that your company had experienced several shootings in recent weeks. We are greatly surprised to hear this. After investigation, your company's food and beverage department has had absolutely no such incidents in recent weeks. Where did this "several shootings" come from? This is clearly a fabrication. Fearing that false information will be spread and mislead the public, we are writing to request a correction. To the Editor of Shen Bao, from Guanshengyuan Co., Ltd., November 13th. (Editor's note: This draft was translated from the English-language *The Times*).

### Love Is Mysterious: It Can Bring Joy and Sorrow

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of a Russian Labor University

One of the happiest things in life is love between men and women. However, one of the most tragic things in the world is an unhappy marriage. Many couples in society often lament their dissatisfaction with each other, and those with stubborn natures do not hesitate to sacrifice their lives. Therefore, it is better to live alone and happily than to have an unhappy union. However, since the purpose of life is reproduction, and we are endowed by nature with two major desires—appetite and sexual desire—we ultimately cannot resist nature. Therefore, the only remedy is to enrich our knowledge of seeking love after marriage.

To study the methods of seeking love, the first question that must be clarified is the source of love between men and women. This question actually involves medicine, as countless famous medical experts throughout the world unanimously believe that love between men and women is related to energy. The sexologist Dr. Havelock Ellis of England once stated frankly: "True love between husband and wife comes from reproductive desire." This is a profound statement, because after a night of passion, men and women become even more intimate. However, to maintain this kind of love permanently and to continuously generate new love, the man's energy must be healthy to stimulate the other party. If the man's reproductive ability is weak and cannot arouse the other party's pleasure, the two parties cannot coordinate in their love life, and love will rapidly decline, even to the point where the two parties become enemies, inevitably leading to the breakdown of the marriage!

Smart men: On your wedding night, do you consider that your future reproductive power will gradually decline? If you want to consider this point, then you must first avoid excessive indulgence, because after excessive indulgence, neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, and impotence can erupt, increasing the other party's annoyance and blocking the door to your pursuit of love.

The causes of premature ejaculation, impotence, and neurasthenia have been described above. However, the method of treatment must start with increasing essence and replenishing blood. Therefore, the first choice for symptomatic treatment is "Body-Con" for men, a testicular essence preparation invented by Dr. Merren of Germany. After taking it, the reproductive function becomes lively and healthy, the complexion becomes rosy, and after taking it for a season, the five bodies flourish. Women should take "Body-Con" for women, the ingredients of which are made from ovarian secretions. Therefore, it has special effects on women's irregular menstruation, infertility after marriage, and all uterine diseases. Women with flat breasts who take this will be able to increase their bust and restore their health and beauty.

### The Harms of Coughing and Excessive Phlegm

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang, Lung Disease Expert

Except for dry coughs, most cough patients have phlegm, and some have excessive phlegm without coughing. Both are pathological conditions of the lungs. Those with strong lungs have less phlegm, and those with weak lungs have more. If there is a disease inside, it is even more serious. This is because bacteria erode the lungs, causing increased secretions. However, the reproduction of bacteria often uses phlegm masses as nests. Therefore, those with excessive phlegm are prone to danger. If you observe the progression of pulmonary tuberculosis, you will see that coughing and expectoration increase sharply. Conversely, if the amount of phlegm gradually decreases, the disease will also gradually decline. Anyone with a little common sense can understand this. Therefore, people who usually have excessive phlegm must pay close attention. If their physical strength is once insufficient, an accident may occur, and in severe cases, it can become pneumonia or terrible pulmonary gangrene, which will be overwhelming. Those who are fortunate enough to turn into chronic cases often become pulmonary tuberculosis or bronchiectasis, which linger for a long time and are difficult to cure. Treatment is very difficult. Therefore, they suffer from illness for life, or unexpected changes occur along the way, which is very worrying. This is why the call to reduce pulmonary tuberculosis is becoming increasingly loud in the medical community. From my many years of experience, the shortcut to removing phlegm and relieving cough is to take "Bu Fei Na Er." I still remember that at the beginning of last month, Mr. Jin Hanxiang suffered from a cold, followed by a persistent cough and expectoration, which lasted for two months. Repeated medical treatments were ineffective, and he also used various cough suppressants and antitussives on the market, but none of them had any effect. Moreover, the symptoms sometimes worsened. The color of the phlegm turned yellow, and he coughed about a pack of cigarettes a day. He lost weight sharply, and was exhausted and tired. I instructed him to take "Bu Fei Na Er." Within a few hours of taking it, the cough was greatly reduced, and in a short period of time, the phenomenon of coughing disappeared. At the same time, the phlegm mass gradually became thin and reduced. He was finally completely cured in a short period of time, his energy gradually recovered, and his weight gradually increased until he regained his health before the illness. I heard that his parents were old and had a lot of phlegm, so I also instructed them to take "Bu Fei Na Er" and they were cured. This agent is not only good at removing phlegm, but also a tonic. As for its cough-suppressing effect, it is entirely due to the drug's efficacy, and no inferior ingredients with anesthetic properties are added to it.

### New Weapon for Treating Gonorrhea

— Huang Zhongchang, American Doctor of Medicine

Judging from the enthusiastic movement to combat gonorrhea in modern European and American countries, it is clear that gonorrhea threatens human survival. According to news released by the Scientific New Society, more than 60 groups to reduce gonorrhea have been organized in the past two years to jointly eradicate gonorrhea. The only weapon they rely on to treat gonorrhea is "Kelinnong," a preparation made from a mixture of protein bodies and yellow pigment. Originally, "Kelinnong" was invented by Dr. Peter, the German ambassador for gonorrhea. Because its ingredients are scientifically blended and precisely packaged, it has no adverse effects after taking it. Therefore, it is effective for all gonorrhea, whether acute or chronic. Its bactericidal power occurs at the site of the lesion, just right, without being excessive or insufficient. It can be called an all-powerful preparation among oral medications for gonorrhea. Therefore, it is popular all over the world. In my decades of experience, "Kelinnong" is the leader among oral medications. As for external use, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used. Women can use "Carl Shendi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. They can all be treated at home according to the instructions and can be cured in a short time.

### Case of Cured Seminal Emission: The Value of Health Preservation

— Zheng Ting, German Doctor of Medicine

A patient named Tang Guozhi, from Wuxi, 22 years old, (claimed)——I have always been strong. When I was 17 years old, I liked to read obscene books and pornographic movies, so I developed the bad habit of masturbation. After about half a year, I gradually realized the harm of masturbation and wanted to quit. Unexpectedly, the habit had become established, and although I had a firm determination, I was unable to quit completely. But because I was strong, I didn't have many symptoms. When I was 19 years old, I once prostituted myself with a friend. A week later, I contracted gonorrhea. Fortunately, I was treated quickly and recovered soon. Unexpectedly, after that, I suddenly had seminal emissions. At first, it was nocturnal emission, but later it was emission without dreams, and my body became extremely weak and my brain became even weaker. Although I took tonics, they had no effect. Today, I saw the newspaper report and came to seek treatment. (Treatment process)——I ordered him to practice health preservation, avoid evil thoughts, engage in noble entertainment, pay attention to exercise, rub the local area with cold water before going to bed, and take "Yi Nai Er Si Seminal Emission Tablets" three times a day. I also ordered him to avoid irritating products such as tobacco and alcohol. Mr. Tang followed my words and acted accordingly. A week later, the seminal emission had stopped. He also took "Body-Con" for two months, and his brain was clear, he slept soundly, and his health had been fully restored.

### Gonorrhea Destroys Reproduction

— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

The seminal vesicles and testicles are important organs of the internal reproductive system, serving as storage for sperm or as a reservoir for semen sent from the testicles. Once this area is invaded by gonococci, the sperm stored in the past will be poisoned, and the major task of human reproduction will be destroyed, with all unfortunate events arising from this.

Gonococcal seminal vesiculitis can also be divided into acute and chronic types. Its occurrence is mostly caused by prostatitis, vasitis, etc., which is the source of recurrent epididymitis. The general symptoms are mostly abdominal distension, with pain radiating from the seminal vesicle area to the surrounding area, or affecting the anus and perineum, giving an unpleasant feeling. The penis also constantly has stinging or even itching pain. This pain often becomes the cause of seminal vesicle hernia pain. The pain of seminal vesicle compression is particularly severe during urination. At this time, if you still indulge in bad surgery and are misled by inferior drugs, you will inevitably make one mistake after another, and your reproductive ability will be completely destroyed to the point of being irreparable. Therefore, at this time, if you can abandon unreasonable medical treatment as soon as possible and switch to the latest invented gonorrhea special drug "New Kelinnong," so that its bactericidal power can directly reach the lesion without any side effects. On the one hand, the German inductive electrostatic therapy and WettererX therapy are used to assist in plastic surgery to correct the pathological condition, so that the important reproductive organs that are frequently damaged can be restored to completeness. I have more than 20 years of experience in these therapies and can ensure that patients are free from the pain of leukorrhea, and at the same time, I can restore the reproductive function of patients with leukorrhea. There is no case of failure. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting from today, 20 numbers are sent for consultation every day. Each number only costs 5 jiao, and a copy of "The Complete Book of Sexually Transmitted Diseases" is given, which has a detailed description of gonorrhea and sexually transmitted diseases.

### Paradise and Cigars

— Bian Luo

Whenever I have insomnia, my thoughts are like kites with broken strings, falling anywhere, without any certainty. Sometimes I also think of some interesting things and write them down as essays, which is also a way to make good use of waste. I don't know how, but I thought of a film I had seen in the past.

It seemed to be promoting science, but in reality, it was a film in which white people preached religion to black people. The special thing was that all the characters were black. The stories were all taken from the Bible or legendary sacred deeds. If you haven't read the Bible, you're not very interested. The box office was very poor, and many people left halfway through.

But what makes me think of it now is a section depicting paradise. In addition to being able to fly on clouds, there are also cigars distributed, one to each person, which they smoke heartily, and use to invite God to smoke. Maybe this is the black people's paradise. I don't know if it's like that in the Bible. But the scene of performing the smoking of cigars aroused laughter from the foreign audience, and the attitude was not very serious. This makes me think that the restraint of foreign gentlemen smoking in front of ladies seems to be a blessing in the black people's paradise.

However, this paradise is indeed built by gentlemen, but it's only for black people and above to visit.

From the question of whether you can smoke cigars in paradise, I feel that people's imaginations are limited in a very pitiful way, and even the imagination of happiness is not very superhuman. Religious people always imagine heaven and hell based on people's likes and dislikes. A friend once said to me: He doesn't believe in religion because there are too many etiquette rules in heaven, which is very troublesome and not happy at all. He admitted that he could only wander outside the gates of heaven and hell.

Naturally, everyone imagines paradise differently. It seems very complicated to create a paradise model that is applicable to everyone. This is the bankruptcy of paradise and the sorrow of religious people.

The human world is still the human world. Although it's a little dirty, we just need to be diligent in cleaning it up.

A paradise with cigars to eat is at most a harmless joke. If it were reality, it would be a great tragedy of the 1940s.

However, alas, really alas! Some kind of paradise is not an ideal paradise.

I'm going to sing hymns.

### Burial of Memories

— Bian Chen

I checked my luggage several times, each time picking out things that I thought were dangerous. In the end, I only had a few ragged clothes left, so I felt relieved. As soon as the sun set, I said goodbye to my colleagues in the factory, shook their hands, and the emotion moved their words, trembling their heartfelt confessions incoherently. However, I understood that I was leaving them with their expectations on my shoulders. I hurriedly boarded the streetcar.

At the dock, the customs clock was only striking eight, but the ship was scheduled to leave at twelve. The money in my pocket wasn't enough, so I couldn't be with the noble passengers. I took the cheapest steerage class, where there were only a few benches. The so-called "dining room" was spacious, with soft stools and hot towels, and the cabins were even more interesting, where you could dream just like at home.

But I hadn't had a good dream for years. What's a few hours' journey! I just had to be patient. I had no companions, so I had to watch my things myself. I couldn't relax while sitting on the bench. If I relaxed, something would go wrong. My things might be taken away, or someone might snatch my seat, and it would be difficult to deal with when they were sleeping soundly on it! I resisted my fatigue and the vendors' shouts! I waited until midnight, and the ship began to sail on the dark river.

After the ship left the Wusong estuary, most people huddled up and dozed off because of fatigue and the thin cold of midnight. Outside the舷 was a piece of darkness. The indicator lights on the few buoys, now bright now dark, made people miss the fireflies of summer nights. Illuminated by these "fireflies," you could discern a few dilapidated giant ships passing by in the darkness.

This was a trip that didn't match my imagination at all. The midnight cold mixed with fatigue into such an unbearable suffering!

When the color of the sky outside the舷 could discern a little melancholic gray-green, the canary raised by the sailor began to call. However, I had already paid all my energy to cope with the cold and fatigue. At this time, I watched with excitement as my ship glided towards the golden waves!

The ship docked in the morning sun. I would disembark at the third port. I remembered a burden left in my memory—a diary. So I checked my luggage again, took it out, and carefully examined it. At the beginning of the volume was a portrait of myself, below which was written "Adversity Calendar," followed by a few lines that I still vaguely remembered:

This is my lodging on the snail's tail,

Shadow of a solitary step drawn in space,

This is my love, hate, sorrow, and joy,

But I will love her without choosing.

I was a little apprehensive. This child of suffering, she depicted my hardship and misfortune, she depicted a series of days of my own embarrassment, insecurity, exile, and hope. Its authenticity was the reason I loved it, but now, this little bit of authenticity would also become the reason for my suffering.

I gathered the determination to part with the "past." Go, the dregs left in my memory:—I threw this string of calendars into the golden waves!

Friend! My hand trembled a little. Behind my generosity, there was inevitably a stingy hidden pain. Plus, it floated up from the waves again and never sank. How painful!

I was frightened. Fortunately, no one noticed, but this black cover, scarlet paper edges, floated forever in the center of the river until it was a small black shadow.

Now, I have watched her follow the river and roll into the Yellow Sea. Friend: I am very ashamed. I almost cried. I was really as sad as losing a daughter.

I remembered the two epigraphs at the beginning of this calendar. Let me find some comfort here!

By writing it, I feel relieved.

I can put down this burden of memory!

Now even this little memory on paper has been thrown into the Yellow Sea, then, "Goodbye, shadow of the past!"

### The Returning Finger

— Chi Qiang

A finger isn't anything rare.

A finger that grabs a piece of charcoal and draws circles on the wall to record work hours, what's so great about it. There are really not a few fingers like that in the world that draw the scars of humanity.

To put it more amusingly, it's just that finger that children usually hold in their mouths, all wet.

No matter how restless a finger is, it shouldn't arouse the interest of a philosopher's research, and the law against disturbing public order has never noticed this tiny bit of life.

This time, a villager sent me a letter saying that A Wu, in his last struggle for life on the battlefield, entrusted his partner to bring back a finger. When I opened it, it really looked like a stiff silkworm. The villagers spread it as an amazing miracle, saying that A Wu also had a way.

The partner said: "A Wu ate a row of bullets by the river. After shouting a few times, I snaked over and carried him behind a cemetery, applied medicine, and bandaged the wound. He resisted, cut off this finger, and didn't say anything else, just said this sentence: 'Those who pull the trigger all use this one...' Then he fell!"

A Wu was a farmer who "did odd jobs" and "ate shoulder skin rice" (Note). He often appeared in the homes of those who plowed with their eyes and helped with farm work. After eating mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival the year before last, a division suddenly passed through the border on a starry night, and he seemed to have disappeared. The news that he had died on the battlefield had been passed on countless times, but it was never confirmed. I remember that A Wu used to make a model of a small pistol with his index finger and thumb,貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼貼
eye corner between his index finger and squinting eyes, aiming at those sparrows. This time, the stiff silkworm-like finger may be the finger that drove away the sparrows.

There are really not a few in the world who use such fingers to draw the scars of humanity and complete new history pages. Hearing of his return and honoring him is not superfluous.

(Note) That is, the slang term for porters and bearers

### A Brief Discussion on Phonetic Script

— Yi Ren

At this language exhibition, there was a performance of blind people reading and writing. A charitable friend was deeply moved upon seeing it, almost to tears, and told me upon returning that he wished to donate some money to them because this kind of education is truly great and should be supported.

Indeed, the blind are among the most unfortunate of humankind. Their lives are filled only with darkness, without light. However, humanity is, after all, progressing, and now there is special education for the blind that can compensate for this natural deficiency.

What is most special about this special education? It is the complete replacement of our original "square characters" with "phonetic script." Once the blind are proficient in the alphabet of phonetic script, they can read and write like ordinary people.

This makes me think of illiterate people, whom we often call "the unlettered." They also suffer greatly because of their illiteracy. We often see people at tram stops asking, "Sir, which tram is this?" Isn't the tram number clearly written? But for those who cannot read, it's as if it's not there. How pitiful!

So, why don't we also use "phonetic script" to eliminate illiteracy? Currently, phonetic script is certainly not as "respectable" or "aristocratic" as square characters. However, phonetic script is easy to learn and can be mastered in at most two or three weeks, making it as easy and accessible to the masses as "deep-fried dough sticks and soybean milk." Otherwise, I'm afraid square characters will never be accessible to the blind.

Therefore, knowing square characters is like a rich person riding in a car, while reading phonetic script is like a poor person riding in a tram. Let each go their own way and find their own place. If we oppose others promoting phonetic script simply because we already know square characters, then we would be like car riders stubbornly opposing others from riding trams, which is utterly unreasonable.

### Anna May Wong's Melancholy About Being in Movies

— Jun Tao

We all know that Anna May Wong is Chinese, but she is not a daughter who grew up in China. She grew up in the Chinese district of Los Angeles, USA. Anna May Wong's father's name is Huang Sanxin, and her mother's maiden name was Li. From a young age, she had hopes of entering the film industry, so she later changed her name to Anna May Wong. This was because she anticipated that this name would be more suitable in the film industry!

Not long ago, Anna May Wong published an article expressing her sadness about being in movies. In one passage, she said, "When I entered the film industry, I felt that I had realized my long-held hope, and I have recently been playing female lead roles in films! Although I do not hope to become a very famous movie star, it can be said that I am the only Chinese woman living a screen life in the Hollywood film industry!"

"There are millions of Chinese expatriates all over the world, and there are also thousands in the United States, including a small number of artists. In this situation, I find it a bit strange and a bit disappointingly depressing. Why? Because there is no famous Chinese male star in the Hollywood film industry. This makes my chances of performing romances on the screen hopeless! But I am not sad because there are no romances, but when I see other actresses performing romances, I cannot help but have some feelings!"

Anna May Wong is a very enthusiastic Chinese. Two years ago, she returned to China with her parents, so she has a better understanding of the motherland. She has not been back to the motherland since. After she returned to the United States, she signed a contract with Paramount Pictures to shoot several films. Her most recent film was "King of Chinatown," which she co-starred in with Akim Tamiroff. The film that followed was "North of Singapore," which is set in China. The content is probably more progressive than the films she made before returning to China. Especially since the war of resistance, the Hollywood film industry has changed its past attitude and will no longer produce films that insult China.

### The Bell Has Rung

— Zou Xiao

The "Big Bell" Drama Society held its first public performance at the Xuan Palace Theater on Sunday morning. Although only three one-act plays and two dances were performed, most of them were meaningful. At this time and in this place, they gave the audience a lot of stimulation and excitement.

"Twilight of an Old Villa" is a Soviet defense play, depicting how a female spy is caught by a falsely named engineer, clever and full of changes. The dance "Madre Mia" was created and performed by Yang Fan himself. This "star pupil" of Wu Xiaobang is now even more advanced. Aren't there often national heroes in Madre Mia fighting for their country? This song and dance is about the farewell of a national hero's lover as he goes off to war. Although it is about the Soviet Union and Spain, it can also be said to be about China.

Wu Tian's creation "Departure" is the most meaningful. A musician, unable to bear a year of depression, finally steels himself to abandon his blind mother, his understanding wife, and his crying child, and resolutely leaves. In the past, we often saw news in the newspapers about the departure of admirable young people, some encouraged by their parents, some leaving secretly without their parents knowing. The day before yesterday, we also saw news in the newspapers about the pen-wielding team and the acting team led by Hong Shen and Ma Yanxiang. Now, seeing this play about these departing people, we truly feel admiration and gratitude, and at the same time, we feel ashamed in our hearts. Lu Ji, playing the wife, said, "After you leave, I can teach, I can do something beneficial to society." This resolute decision, abandoning love and prioritizing the country, earned the applause of the entire audience.

Wu Tian often uses suggestion to write about the musician's state of mind and the reality of the environment. For example, when the musician asks the policeman about the desolate dawn, it is because he feels pain. He probably also thinks about the difficult life he will encounter after he leaves. His wife and his mother both talked about how when he was a child, he would fight with others, and if he couldn't beat them, he would hide in the peach tree, but he would still fight with the other children. Later, they also said that the peach tree would bloom with vibrant flowers, and the birds would sing joyfully among the trees. What a good metaphor this is, and what meaningful words! The bell has rung, this extraordinary first sound!

### Miss Ning Xuan, a famous amateur performer in Shanghai, grew up in the north and speaks fluent and melodious Mandarin. She is slender and of moderate height. Her appearance when dressed in costume from the drama Hong Bi Lou is absolutely stunning. Recently, Yihua Film Company, having heard of her fame, invited her to join them. Miss Ning has always been interested in screen work. In the past, she has made guest appearances in films such as "A Record of a Film Studio" and "Women's Apartment," so she immediately agreed to Yihua's offer. It is said that she has already signed a contract a few days ago.

### Chen Yunshang's New Film "Fei Zhen'e Assassination of the Tiger" Begins Filming

— Yin Di

After Chen Yunshang's starring film "One Night Empress" was publicly screened at the Shanghai Guangda Theater, the Huacheng Film Studio began discussing the subject matter of Chen Yunshang's fourth work. Initially, it was decided that Fang Peilin's direction of "Sakyamuni" would be co-starred by Chen Yunshang and Mei Xi. Now, for the sake of solemn production, "Sakyamuni" will be fully prepared and will not be filmed for the time being. Thus, "Fei Zhen'e Assassination of the Tiger" was decided to be filmed first.

"Fei Zhen'e Assassination of the Tiger" is a famous play on the stage. In the past, Mei Lanfang also filmed it, but it was only a fragment of Peking Opera. Now, what Huacheng is filming is the entire tragic story of Fei Zhen'e's assassination of the tyrant, directed by Li Pingqian, with Chen Yunshang playing Fei Zhen'e. Filming began last week at the Lilac Garden Studio.

The role of "One Tiger," who has malicious intentions towards Fei Zhen'e, is played by Xu Xinyuan. This Chinese detective Chen Charlie on the screen ends up dying at the hands of a palace maid. It is expected that under the performance of Chen Yunshang and Xu Xinyuan, this scene will be very tense and moving.

### Lafei Organizes Its Own Backstage Team, Henceforth With a Fresh Look

— Hua Zhi

A few days ago, there was a news item in this publication about the Lafei Theater, roughly saying that the theater would be organizing a backstage team led by Mr. Xu Bu from the sixteenth of this month. This news is now in the past and is slightly inaccurate. According to what the author knows, I will write it out to inform those who care about spoken drama:

After the contract between the Film Union Troupe and Lafei expired at the end of last month, the Film Union did not continue because of the urgent work of filming. At that time, Mr. Xu Bu planned to invite someone to be the backstage boss to cooperate with the Lafei front desk, but now, the front desk does not intend to cooperate with others and will organize its own backstage team. Currently, long-term contracts have been signed with Tan Guangyou, Ge Xin, Chen Yulin, Cai Jinglu, and other members of the China Travel returning troupe from Shanghai, as well as Cai Jin, Shen Ling, Shao Hua, and others from the Shanghai drama community. Everything has been arranged, and from the next new play "Peach Blossom Dream" onwards, they will meet the audience with this fresh look. For the first half of November (performing "The Misanthrope" and "An Ideal Husband"), according to the Lafei administration, this is a transitional period.

In the past year, the spoken drama movement has once again seen a vigorous trend. We hope that Lafei can thrive from now on.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

A play praising national heroes

Suddenly, I thought of the fact that today is my mother's birthday. However, because the national crisis is pressing, I have forgotten my family for the sake of the country, and I don't even know what day it is today. Thinking of this, I felt extremely uneasy and hurriedly prostrated myself on the ground. At this time, Zhou's mother did not know that Daizhou had already fallen, and still thought that Yu Ji had come specifically to celebrate her birthday, so the whole family, from the Grand Madam down, was overjoyed and even more delighted than when Zhou had not yet arrived. At the banquet, Yu Ji alone suffered in his heart, not daring to speak plainly. He thought to himself that after seeing the bandit troops enter Dai, they would surely take advantage of the victory to attack Ningwu. At this time, the whole family is gathered together, but in a short while, when the bandit soldiers arrive, they will all be ghosts with severed heads. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but burst into tears. The Grand Madam was very discerning. At this time, there was a famine in the world, and bandit soldiers were rising up everywhere. She had already heard about the attack by the rebel army. Now that the war was in full swing, Yu Ji, who was responsible for defending the territory, could not possibly have taken the time to come here at this time. At first, when she saw his face full of exhaustion and his restless state, she had already suspected something. Now, suddenly seeing him bowing his head in thought, tears streaming down his face, she had already guessed most of it in her heart. Therefore, she hurriedly asked Yu Ji, "How did Daizhou fall? Why don't you tell me the truth?" When Yu Ji saw that his mother had already seen through him, he immediately knelt down and recounted the details of his battle with the rebel bandits, and said that the rebel leader Hong Ji had been captured, and the rebel brother One Tiger had had an arm cut off, and countless rebel soldiers had been killed, but because the rebel soldiers were too numerous and there was no external assistance, the isolated city was difficult to defend. Now he planned to return to the government to bid farewell to his mother and make one last appearance, and then fight to the death to repay the country. When Zhou's mother heard this, not only did she not wail like an ignorant village woman, but she also smiled and comforted Yu Ji, saying, "I have worked hard for the Zhou family, teaching my son to become famous, and I originally hoped that my son would be able to be loyal and repay the country. Today's events are exactly what I have always wished for. Moreover, I have lived to be seventy years old, and I will not die young. If you can repay the country, I will die first to strengthen your resolve." (140)
