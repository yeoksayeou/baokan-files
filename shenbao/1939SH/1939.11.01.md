Both routes of Japanese troops were routed by the Chinese army's flanking maneuvers.

Chongqing: The recent great victory in Northern Hunan has filled the nation with joy, and congratulations have been telegraphed from all sides. Now, Xinjiang Governor Sheng Shicai and Chairman Li Rong have jointly sent a telegram of congratulations. The original text is as follows: "Having omitted some honorifics" The War of Resistance has been ongoing for over two years. The loyal and brave soldiers at the front, under the resolute leadership of our Supreme Commander Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, have fought bravely against the enemy, repeatedly thwarting their plots. The victories in Taierzhuang, Pingxingguan, and the major battles in northern Hubei have spread far and wide, enough to make the stubborn enemy tremble with fear. However, the invaders' ambition has not died. In this battle of Northern Hunan, they mobilized 100,000 troops to attack us, attempting to capture Changsha in one fell swoop. Fortunately, our two commanders directed the battle effectively, and the troops on all fronts rushed to fight bravely, ultimately achieving a surprising victory, annihilating tens of thousands of Japanese troops. This unprecedented great victory is a prelude to the renaissance of the Chinese nation. When the news of the victory arrived, the masses rejoiced.

### Generalissimo Chiang Commends and Rewards Troops Returning to Build Roads

Chongqing: According to official sources here today, the highways in various provinces of northwestern China were mostly built with the assistance of the Ma family's Muslim troops.

### Japan Eagerly Seeks to Adjust Relations with Britain and the United States, Solving the China Incident is the Focus, the Japanese Foreign Ministry Discusses Diplomatic Strategies

Tokyo: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting at 6:30 PM yesterday to discuss diplomatic policies to deal with the China Incident. Foreign Minister Nomura, Vice Ministers Tada and Tani Masayuki, and the directors of various bureaus attended. The meeting adjourned at 0:00 this morning. The matters discussed at the meeting were how Japan should conduct diplomacy with Britain and the United States based on the upcoming establishment of a "central government" in China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to hold continuous meetings in the coming days to continue negotiations. The adjustment of relations with Britain and the United States will focus on the China Incident and will be conducted with particular caution. Among them, the Tianjin issue will be resolved first in relations with Britain, and communication between the two countries will be facilitated in relations with the United States in order to discover clues to resolve the outstanding issues between the two countries. Foreign Minister Nomura, because of the need to first listen to the other party's opinions, plans to meet with the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, in the coming days to exchange views. (31st Domei Dispatch)

Tokyo: This morning, Foreign Minister Nomura, Vice Minister Tani Masayuki, and senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met to discuss the specific procedures for the "new central government" in China. It is expected that the China Affairs Bureau will hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss in detail the handling of Chinese affairs, and the interests of the third-party powers in China in response to the emergence of the "new central government" in China. It is heard that Prime Minister Abe, Foreign Minister Nomura, Army Minister Hata Shunroku, Navy Minister Yoshida, Finance Minister Aoki, and other senior officials will attend the meeting. Today, the Nichi Nichi Shimbun published an article commenting on the issue, saying that Japan is now gradually approaching the goal of resolving Chinese affairs, and will soon use the construction of a new "central government" in China as its marker. At the same time, it will adjust Japan's relations with the third-party powers. Although a formal agreement has not yet been officially reached, it seems that Foreign Minister Nomura will meet with US Ambassador to Japan Grew in the coming days to exchange views on the situation between Japan and the United States. The Asahi Shimbun believes that when Foreign Minister Nomura meets with US Ambassador Grew, he will likely ask for recognition of the large-scale military operations that Japan is currently conducting in China, just as former Foreign Minister Arita did near the time of the Anglo-Japanese conference, when he asked the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, to express his consent. Nomura will likely ask Grew to recognize Japan's sincerity and efforts in respecting American rights and interests in China, and will also ask the ambassador to note Japan's determination to build a new order in East Asia, which cannot be shaken by opposition or interference from any party, even if the United States imposes economic pressure on Japan after abolishing the 1911 US-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty, followed by a ban on arms shipments to Japan, or uses other means. There are currently as many as 600 outstanding issues between the United States and Japan. After Nomura agrees on the general principles with the ambassador, they will be transferred to the local area for resolution. (31st Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial

### Hesitant Japan

At the beginning of last month, Japanese Prime Minister Abe and Foreign Minister Nomura, at a meeting of local governors, declared their diplomatic policy: towards the United States, they said they would "continue to work hard so that the United States can fully understand Japan's true intentions." At the end of last week, a Tokyo dispatch stated that Japan planned to hold trial negotiations with the United States this week; therefore, whether US-Japan relations improve or deteriorate will be decided within this week. As of the night before last, a Tokyo dispatch from the Japanese Domei News Agency stated that the issues to be discussed in the US-Japan talks included (1) general interests in China (i.e., the Nine-Power Treaty's principles of open door, equal opportunity, opening of concessions, and navigation on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers), (2) US-Japan trade issues, and (3) Pacific peace guarantees. It also stated that the Japanese government believes that making Britain and the United States aware of the new order is a shortcut to resolving the situation, so the Japanese government will fully exchange views with relevant parties and first conduct this work with Britain and the United States. Another dispatch from Domei stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities continued the morning's talks at 6:30 p.m. on the 30th, reopening the summit at the Foreign Minister's official residence, chaired by Foreign Minister Nomura, to continue discussions on the steps and policies Japan should take in dealing with negotiations with Britain, Japan, and the United States. All the above descriptions are based on official or semi-official Japanese sources: Japan's current "concerns" can be said to be clearly expressed in its words.

However, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Suma, suddenly completely denied what was reported in yesterday's newspaper; a summary of its main points is as follows:

"The Japanese government has no intention of starting formal or informal talks with Britain and the United States at present to resolve various outstanding issues, nor has it ever made such an attempt. He intends to dispel the impression created by various Japanese newspapers that US-Japan and British-Japan talks will be held soon. British Ambassador Craigie has met with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani Masayuki, but part of this conversation was routine and unrelated to the rumored negotiations between Japan and Britain and the United States. Foreign Minister Nomura may meet with US Ambassador Grew soon to discuss routine matters, but the purpose of this meeting is also not to start formal negotiations between the United States and Japan. The news that the Pearl River and the Yangtze River will be opened soon for foreign shipping is just speculation. The Japanese government authorities, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, are not currently considering such matters. It is expected that China's new 'regime' will be established within a month. The establishment of China's 'new central government' will clarify the situation in the Far East. Japan's decided policy is to assist China's 'new central government' in its steady development."

"Foreign Affairs" "spokesman" is a qualified liar; helplessly, he blames the newspapers, saying that there are no other unspeakable secrets? Speculating on this: either because the expectation of negotiations with Britain and the United States failed in its exploratory phase, so it denies it; or because there is no certainty of success in the negotiations, so it engages in secret contact, reserving room for maneuver after failure; or because internal Japanese opinions are divided and contradictory on issues such as opening up navigation, unable to unify, unable to negotiate with Britain and the United States, and therefore has to avoid consideration; or because it focuses all its hopes on the dream of a "political offensive," thinking that it can also extricate itself from the quagmire and hopes to clarify the Far East. All the above speculations cannot be asserted as inevitable, but there are clues to be found, and it is believable that they are not far from the truth. Although I think what he said is due to unspeakable secrets, what Japan is most anxious about is to attempt to melt Britain and the United States and hope to start negotiations, which is definitely not something that a qualified lie can achieve and I think. Therefore, I believe that pursuing the opportunity to start talks is one thing, and immediately conducting negotiations is another. We cannot regard the denial as meaning that there will be no more negotiations; it should be known that Abe's rise to power and Nomura's taking office are actually the prelude to their ideal of finding a diplomatic path to open up Britain and the United States.

From our observation, Japan knows that it is trapped in a quagmire, so it is eager to extricate itself; what a pity that it lacks the courage of a strong man to cut off his wrist and the wisdom to change its course; the sun is setting, and the road is long, with no way out. To analyze it: it initially wished to use a military offensive, regardless of everything, to solve everything, but by the third year, the military offensive had reached the end of its strength; then it planned to use a political offensive, regardless of everything, to create all the established facts, but unexpectedly it could not get its way internally, and there was heavy pressure from abroad that it could not ignore; therefore, in order to complete the partial success of its aggression, it had to seek a combination of diplomatic and political offensives. What Suma called "the establishment of a new central government in China will clarify the situation in the Far East," and the Domei News Agency's statement that "the Japanese government believes that making Britain and the United States aware of the new order is a shortcut to resolving the situation" are confessions of expecting cooperation. Britain and the United States have their own policies, and the United States' policy is firm and cannot be shaken by Japan's diplomatic strategies and tactics; Japan does not reflect on itself but begs for diplomatic solutions, only to see its efforts become increasingly fruitless and will eventually achieve nothing, which we have repeatedly said; however, if the rumored negotiations between the United States and Japan do begin, then Japan will have an opportunity to be instructed by the United States. We hope that the United States will patiently guide Japan, and Japan may therefore regain its reason, which would not be in vain for the United States. If Japan insists on seeing this as a diplomatic offensive, then Japan will definitely receive a more practical lesson after the negotiations: and the negotiations will also be another stage in Japan's sunset and gradual decline.

The Japanese are not necessarily lacking in reason, but they are blinded by greed, resulting in incoherence. Try to prove this with their political tactics; an Associated Press Tokyo dispatch on the day stated that "a spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared here today that a new central government to rule the Japanese-occupied areas will be established within a month." A Reuters Tokyo dispatch on the same day stated that Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Suma said that "the establishment of a new central government will clarify the situation in the Far East." How can the consciousness between occupied areas and new central government be contradictory and incomprehensible? Even if only charged with ruling the occupied areas, and again expected to clarify the Far East, in terms of name and reality, the space is not suitable, and the distance is ten thousand miles, how can this consciousness be incomprehensible again? Honoring the organization of the occupied area as a new central government, honoring the functions of the new central government as rule: and again, independence, equality, sovereignty, and various terms practically used for countries and internationally, are all used appropriately; we have all heard these words; but why are they so eager to negotiate with Britain and the United States in Tokyo, to seek solutions to rights issues and open door issues? How can they be so fragmented and disjointed? They want to swallow it, but they can't bear to swallow it. They want to not swallow it, but they want to try to swallow it. This kind of患得患失 demeanor cannot be concealed. If they say they no longer want it, no longer want to swallow it, then there is no evidence to date.

### Maintaining Political Independence from Germany: Italian Cabinet Reshuffle: Except for the Prime Minister's Concurrent Positions and the Foreign Minister, Pro-German Military and Political Officials Have All Been Changed

Rome: The cabinet was reshuffled this morning. Except for the various ministries concurrently held by Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano, the ministers of all other ministries have been changed. The Minister of the Army and Chief of Staff and the Secretary-General of the Fascist Party have also been replaced. Previously, Minister of Professional Associations Landini, Minister of Culture and Propaganda Alfieri, Minister of Exchange and Monetary Affairs Gaineri, Minister of Agriculture Rossoni, Minister of Transportation Pelegi, Minister of Public Works Gigliani, Vice Minister of the Army and Chief of Army Staff General Baljani, Vice Minister of Aviation and Chief of Air Force Staff General Vale, and Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office Vassalo jointly submitted their resignations to Prime Minister Mussolini this morning. The Prime Minister immediately accepted them and decided on the candidates for the new cabinet as follows: Prime Minister concurrently Minister of the Army, Navy, and Air Force: Mussolini

Foreign Minister: Ciano (unchanged)
Minister of Colonies (originally held concurrently by the Prime Minister): General Da Lucci (formerly Vice Minister of Colonies)
Minister of Professional Associations: Licci (formerly Vice Minister)
Minister of Culture and Propaganda: Pavolini (new appointment)

Minister of Exchange and Monetary Affairs: Ricciardi (new appointment)
Minister of Agriculture: Tassinari (new appointment)
Minister of Transportation: Fantuli (new appointment)
Minister of Public Works: Serrena (new appointment)
Vice Minister of the Army: General Soddu (new appointment)
Chief of Army Staff: General Graziani (former Governor of Abyssinia)
Vice Minister of Aviation and Chief of Air Force Staff: General Prigo (new appointment)
Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office: General Russo (new appointment)

In addition, a new position was established, specializing in the reconstruction of cities in marshlands, with Mengini as the director. In addition, Secretary-General of the Fascist Party Starace, who has held the position for eight years, has been transferred to the position of Chief of Staff of the Fascist Party Army, and his vacancy will be filled by Party Elder Muti. This person served as an air force pilot during the war between Italy and Abyssinia, achieving outstanding merit, and also played an important role in the Battle of Anibaraya in the Spanish Civil War, after which he served as the Director-General of Overseas Party Affairs of the Fascist Party until now. In addition, Minister of Culture and Propaganda Arofilly has been appointed as an ambassador by Prime Minister Mussolini, but has not yet been assigned a substantive position. Observers have commented on the cabinet reshuffle, saying that former Chief of Army Staff General Baljani, Minister of Culture and Propaganda Alfieri, and Secretary-General of the Fascist Party Starace are all known for being pro-German, and their departure from office is noteworthy (Havas, 31st).

Paris: The Italian cabinet reshuffle has been commented on by political figures here, who said that Italy attaches great importance to strictly maintaining political independence in the current European situation, especially with regard to Germany, which can be clearly demonstrated. The country's Prime Minister Mussolini has thoroughly reshaped the cabinet more than once, but this time the dismissed cabinet members were all in office when the relations between Germany and Italy were the closest. Among them, Minister of Culture and Propaganda Alfieri and Secretary-General of the Fascist Party Starace, who advocated for the close relationship between Germany and Italy, both possessed significant influence among the people in the capacity of "mass guides," and were also known for being pro-German. Therefore, the cabinet change in Italy is of great significance and is valued by the French government (Havas, 31st).

### Italy's Anti-Communist Attitude Remains Unchanged: Italian Ambassador to Britain Expresses

London: Italian Ambassador to Britain Bastianini confirmed yesterday, during the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Fascist entry into Rome, that the Italian Fascist government still holds an anti-Bolshevik attitude. Speaking to 2,000 Italian expatriates, he declared, "Italy, only Italian Fascism has never violated the revolutionary process. The revolutionary movement was born anti-Bolshevik and remains anti-Bolshevik to this day. There has been an antagonistic feeling between Rome and Moscow from the beginning, and that antagonistic feeling continues to this day." After recounting the achievements of the Fascist Party at home and abroad over the past seventeen years, the ambassador declared, "While the great powers participating in the war today hesitate to use their people for tragic and fatal conflicts on a massive scale, Italy has nothing to fear." The ambassador solemnly stated the state of Italy's military preparations, saying, "The Roman government must pay attention to European, especially Mediterranean, issues. The Italian people know that war can still happen even if Italy does not participate. The Italian people know even more that peace cannot be talked about if Italy is not involved in peace negotiations" (AP, 31st).

### Soviet-Italian Intrigue and Struggle: Expanding Influence in the Balkans: Soviet Envoy to Bulgaria Arrives

Stockholm: The "Swedish Daily" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, stating that the Soviet Union and Italy are currently engaged in intrigue and struggle, both seeking to expand their influence in the Balkan Peninsula. This matter is attracting great attention in German officialdom. It is reported that the Soviet Union intends to ask Bulgaria to allow it to construct naval and air bases in Black Sea coastal ports. The Bulgarian government is finding it difficult to refuse. Italy, on the other hand, wants to organize a group of neutral countries in the Balkan Peninsula, including Bulgaria and Hungary, and conclude a treaty of non-aggression with them. However, the countries of the Balkan Peninsula are still hesitant and undecided, unwilling to accept restrictions from major powers (Havas, 31st).

Sofia: The new Soviet envoy to Bulgaria, Lavrentiev, arrived here this morning with three secretaries. Bulgarian envoy to the Soviet Union Andonov is currently on leave here and will return to his post as soon as he receives instructions. Regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, well-informed sources here recently declared that the Soviet Union intends to expand its influence in the Balkan Peninsula and will, in a short period of time, negotiate a commercial agreement and a navigation and aviation treaty with Bulgaria (Havas, 31st).

### Finnish Delegation Again: To Moscow: Limited Concessions to Soviet Demands

Helsinki: The Finnish delegation, led by Finnish envoy to Sweden, Passikivi, is scheduled to depart for Moscow for the third time tonight at 8:35 PM to continue negotiations with the Soviet government. (Havas, 31st)

Helsinki: Finnish envoy Passikivi, accompanied by Finance Minister Tanner, set off for Moscow again today, carrying a written proposal from the Finnish government. According to well-informed sources, this written proposal states the limits of Finnish concessions, and it would be extremely difficult to exceed these limits. (Haitong, 31st)

Copenhagen: According to a telegram from Helsinki, political figures in Helsinki are currently discussing the possibility of concluding a "regional mutual assistance treaty" between the Soviet Union and Finland. This treaty will stipulate that the Gulf of Finland is a closed waterway, and the two contracting parties will mutually recognize interests in the area based on the principle of equality. (Haitong, 31st)

Helsinki: According to a statement from the Finnish government today, all parties and factions in parliament are in complete agreement on Finland's response to the Soviet Union. It is reported that the Finnish government's response completely rejects the Soviet Union's request to establish naval, air, or land bases on Finnish territory. According to political observers here, even if disputes arise between the Soviet Union and Finland, there is still room for mediation in accordance with the 1932 Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty, and it may not immediately resort to military action. (AP, 31st)

### Italian and Greek: Negotiating Non-Aggression Pact

London: News that Italy intends to sign a non-aggression pact with Greece has recently been confirmed by well-informed sources. It is said that the two countries have been negotiating recently, intending to conclude a non-aggression pact based on the 1928 Friendship Treaty. Responsible figures here have expressed welcome upon hearing the news. (Havas, 31st)

### British Government Publishes White Paper: Exposing the Nazi Party's Atrocities in Germany: Over a Thousand Opposition Members Arrested: Inhumane Living Conditions in Concentration Camps

London: The government today released a white paper detailing the Nazi government's mistreatment of Jews and opposition elements, detailing the horrific conditions in German concentration camps. It is said that before and after the outbreak of the war, the German government almost daily promoted Britain's atrocities in South Africa forty years ago. In view of this completely unfounded and shameless propaganda, the British government believes that it is now appropriate to publish some reports on Germany's treatment of its own people. Members of various opposition parties in Germany have recently been arrested on a large scale, no less than one thousand nine hundred and thirty-three people, all of whom have been押入收容所, with barbaric treatment, floggings, and tortures occurring daily. Ordinary people in Germany know that the Nazi movement is taking terrible revenge on opponents. The documents contained in this white paper were originally not intended to be made public. The German government often accuses foreign countries of mistreating German minorities, claiming that there is a "Macedonian situation." However, judging from the documents now published, under the rule of the current German government, the situation of its own people and the treatment of Germans do not remind people of the Macedonian situation, but make people recall the darkest period in human history. British Ambassador Sir Henderson learned in a conversation with Hitler that the German leader was not satisfied with the outcome of the trial of German pastor Niemöller. Hitler said that Niemöller was a traitor, and anyone who expressed sympathy for him should be detained in a concentration camp.

The white paper then contains a statement from a former inmate of the Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar, describing the horrific conditions of the camp. It is said that the camp supervisor, Rödl, told a new batch of prisoners, "Some of you have been in prison before, but the taste you experienced in prison is insignificant compared to the treatment you will receive in this camp. You are now entering hell. If you try to resist the authority of the guards, you will be shot immediately. In this camp, there are only two kinds of punishment, namely flogging and death." In the Buchenwald concentration camp, the daily work is sixteen hours, with no holidays on Sundays. Drinking water is prohibited during work, even in hot weather. A wealthy Jewish businessman, who was once a prisoner, said to people, "The food is not bad, but it is very insufficient. When I was in the camp, Jewish prisoners worked twice as hard as others, but their rations were halved. One type of work, carrying huge stones, is exhausting even for those who are well-nourished. The guards mocked the Jews, saying, 'You are now experiencing the same treatment as your ancestors in Egypt. Pharaoh's treatment of the two was far less than now.'" After the daily work is completed, prisoners stand at attention for several hours. Slight violations of rules during work, such as drinking water, are often punished by flogging. The usual practice is for two guards to take turns administering twenty-five lashes, and the person being flogged often faints. However, the guards told the Jews that the German leader had ordered that Jews could be flogged up to sixty lashes.

Another small businessman, who was arrested without cause on a street in Berlin last June and sent to the camp, also said that the usual punishment was for two guards to stand on either side and whip twenty-five times with a horsewhip. If the prisoner cried out, it would be increased to thirty-five lashes. The guards whipped with all their strength, sometimes raising their whips high to increase the force of the blow. Prisoners were often dragged out without cause and tied by their feet to a footboard, causing them to lie face down on a flat board, with their heads clamped between two horizontal bars, and then flogged. Some prisoners died under the lashes as a result. Those who did not die were kicked back to the shed. Prisoners who went crazy had their heads wrapped in bags to prevent them from screaming. Another type of punishment was to tie the prisoner's arms behind their back and suspend them in the air, three meters above the ground. The camp employed special staff to carry out these punishments, suspending them in the air for ten to twelve hours, which was considered public punishment. As for the crowding of prisoners, it is beyond description. For example, a small shed two hundred feet long and eighty feet wide was forced to house two thousand five hundred prisoners. People die every day in the Buchenwald concentration camp. The families of the deceased only learned of their death when they received a notice to pay three marks to collect the ashes of the corpse. Jews must provide evidence of their ability to leave the country before they can be released. The concentration camp is equipped with a 1,000-watt electric fence to prevent people from escaping. The guards are all under orders that if a prisoner walks towards the gate, they can open fire without warning. The guards often told the Jews that each bullet was worth twelve pence, which was the price of a Jew.

Those arrested get up at dawn and gather in the square where the guillotine and flogging rack are located to distribute coffee. Those who report sick are examined by the supervisor. The supervisor then selects those he deems fit to be flogged and punishes them with flogging. The sick in the labor teams are often taken care of with clubs. Finally, the reporting of sickness by Jews is no longer allowed. Jews can only work or die. On November 11, 1938, British Consul General Garner in Vienna reported on anti-Jewish demonstrations there, saying that when Jewish shops and churches were burned by the crowd, the police were instructed not to interfere. Jews gathered in the streets, subjected to spitting, cursing, and beatings. Those who beat and cursed them prided themselves on being the greatest and most civilized nation in the world. The British Consul General also reported on anti-Catholic demonstrations in Vienna, saying that mobs entered Catholic churches, smashing their doors and windows, and destroying their idols. All religiously valuable antiques and the clothing of Catholic individuals were thrown into the courtyard and set on fire. One priest, who resisted slightly, was severely beaten and almost thrown out of the window, his arm injured by glass shards. The room of one pastor was also broken into, and one priest in the room was thrown out of the window, resulting in both legs being broken. Although the bishop telephoned the police station for help, the police only arrived after a quarter of an hour, and the mob had already dispersed. The police did not arrest anyone. British Consul General Bell in Cologne reported on the anti-Jewish riots on November 14, saying that the riots of November 11 were the result of systematic planning. Middle-class Germans all believed it was wrong, but dared not speak out publicly. One German woman made remarks disapproving of the riots in a streetcar, and was arrested as soon as she got off the bus.

British Consul General Smalbone in Florence described the ordeal of a Jew on December 14, saying that this Jew had participated in the European War and had a legitimate business in Florence. According to him, he was subjected to severe mistreatment before being detained in a concentration camp. The police made him kneel and put his hands behind his back, making him lie face down on the ground until his forehead touched the ground. Police would help Jews who could not do so. They would also force them to run wildly around the house, which the police found amusing. After entering the Buchenwald concentration camp, he was flogged for even minor matters. One Jewish pastor, who refused to sign his name, was flogged. The pastor suffered unbearable pain and finally signed his name in humiliation. (Reuters, 30th)

London: After the British government released the white paper on the German government's mistreatment of its people yesterday, all newspapers extracted and published summaries on the front page, and commented on them. They all said that there is no doubt that the Nazi regime must be overthrown, but the nations of all civilized countries should not hate the entire German nation, because the majority of civilians among them are subjected to the abuse of the country's rulers. (Havas, 31st)

### Another British Cargo Ship: Sunk by Bomb

London: The British cargo ship Carnmore (4,666 tons) has now sunk. Three crew members are said to be missing. The other forty-one crew members landed in lifeboats today. According to crew members, the ship was given no warning before a violent explosion occurred and it sank immediately within twenty minutes. The missing crew members were trapped below deck and are believed to have been killed by the blast (Reuters, 31st).

### Dutch Merchant Ship: Explodes in North Sea

London: The Dutch merchant ship Thorn (1,239 tons) exploded in the North Sea today and sank in less than ten minutes. Twenty-four crew members either escaped in lifeboats or jumped into the sea to await rescue. After more than twenty minutes, the Norwegian ship Mimona (1,153 tons) passed by and rescued the crew members who had jumped into the sea, and the occupants of the lifeboats were also rescued by the ship (Reuters, 30th).

### German Air Force Bombs British Fleet Again; British and French Planes Also Conduct Reconnaissance Over Germany; Military Activity Slightly Increases as Weather Clears on Western Front

London - The Admiralty announces that two German bombers attacked a British destroyer squadron south of Dogger Bank this morning. The destroyers suffered no damage and no crew members were injured. It is not yet known whether the German planes were damaged. (Reuters, 30th)

London - The Air Ministry announced that several of our planes flew to various locations in northern Germany today on reconnaissance missions, targeting airfields.

Paris - General Headquarters issued Communiqué No. 113, stating, "Our advanced units and those of the enemy were quite active on the front lines today, and artillery battles occurred in certain areas. Reconnaissance and fighter planes from both sides were also very active. In addition, nearly two months after the outbreak of war, six of our merchant ships, totaling 41,000 tons, have been sunk. We have intercepted four German merchant ships, one of which, the cargo ship "Hell," was scuttled by its crew. The remaining three, totaling 19,000 tons, are now being used by us. Therefore, since the outbreak of war, our actual loss of merchant ships is only 22,000 tons, less than one percent of our total merchant tonnage." (Havas, 30th)

Paris - General Headquarters issued Communiqué No. 114, stating, "Last night was calm and uneventful across the entire front." (Havas, 31st)

Paris - Sources in the Semi area have issued news regarding the situation on the front lines, stating, "The weather has cleared, and military operations have resumed actively. Several German planes invaded French airspace for the first time today for reconnaissance. Our fighter planes immediately took off to intercept, and anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, shooting down one German plane and damaging several others. On the other hand, several of our planes also flew over German positions, penetrating deep behind enemy lines for reconnaissance, and all returned safely to base. In addition, enemy and our troops engaged in prolonged artillery battles." (Havas, 31st)

Berlin - According to an official report issued by the German High Command, only minor artillery fire and reconnaissance activity occurred between the Moselle River and Walder on the Western Front. The other lines were very quiet. A total of four enemy planes were shot down yesterday. (Haitong, 31st)

### British Government Convenes Imperial Conference to Plan Solid Wartime Cooperation; Indian Representative Arrives in London

London - After arriving here, Canadian Federal Minister of Resources, Crerar, stated, "The people of the Canadian Federation love freedom and do not want to allow violence to dominate international relations. Therefore, the current war has great significance, which they understand. My sole mission on this trip is to enable the Canadian Federation to cooperate effectively with Britain, France, and the British Dominions to achieve victory in the shortest possible time. The various parts of the British Empire have been working together for months, with remarkable results. After the representatives of the various parts of the Empire meet in London this time, they will surely achieve even greater effectiveness." (Havas, 30th)

London - Sir Choffrullah Khan, a prominent Indian lawyer and politician, arrived here this afternoon, representing the Indian government, to hold talks with the British government and representatives of the Dominions. (Havas, 30th)

London - According to news from Sydney, Australia, the Australian Dominion government originally intended to send an expeditionary force to Europe to fight, but after consultation with the British government, it has been decided to abandon this plan. (Havas, 31st)

### US Neutrality Act Submitted to the House; Opposition Still Struggles; Insists on Maintaining Arms Embargo

Washington - After the Neutrality Act amendment was passed by the Senate yesterday, the House Rules Committee passed a motion advocating that the amendment be submitted to a joint committee of both houses for review. Republican Congressman Fish requested that the House representatives participating in the joint committee should try to maintain the arms embargo. (Note: The House passed a Neutrality Act amendment in June of this year, retaining the arms embargo clause.) However, the motion was opposed by a majority of the Rules Committee members. The House is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss the Rules Committee's motion. Opposition party congressmen will propose a separate bill insisting on maintaining the arms embargo, which will surely lead to a debate. Democratic Party leaders held a secret meeting this afternoon to estimate how many votes would be obtained in favor of the amendment. Afterwards, responsible figures from the party said that there were still more than 30 undecided Democratic congressmen, but the government could still obtain a majority in favor of the bill when the House votes tomorrow. The Republican National Committee, which originally advocated extending the congressional session to discuss the amendment at length, now believes that Republican congressmen can vote for or against the amendment as they please, so that Congress can adjourn as soon as possible. This change in the party's attitude is probably due to the influence of public opinion, as the American people now attach the greatest importance to the neutrality issue, followed by various domestic issues. In order to prepare for the 1940 election, the Republican Party prefers to end the neutrality issue as soon as possible, so that it can re-discuss domestic issues and avoid delaying the matter, which would arouse public resentment. (Havas, 30th)

### Philippine Government Establishes Department of National Defense; Sison Appointed as Minister

### National Assembly of Western Belarus Passes Important Resolutions; Declared Closed Yesterday

Moscow - The National Assembly of Western Belarus held its final meeting yesterday. Karasev, representing the Credentials Committee, presented a report stating, "Of the 926 delegates to the Assembly, 563 are farmers, 197 are workers, 29 are office workers, 112 are intellectuals, and 25 are artisans. In terms of ethnicity, Belarusians account for 621, Poles 127, Jews 72, Russians 43, Ukrainians 53, and others such as Lithuanians and Tartars total 10. The reporter stated, "These figures fully demonstrate the nature of sincere friendship and cooperation among the various ethnic groups in the National Assembly of Western Belarus."

After unanimously passing two declarations confiscating the land of landlords and nationalizing banks and major industries, the Assembly resolved to declare September 17 as the National Day of Liberation for the working masses of Western Belarus from the shackles of Polish landlords. It also resolved to erect a monument to the fallen Red Army soldiers in Belostok. The Assembly then elected 65 members to report all resolutions of the Assembly to the Soviet government and the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic government. Finally, Assembly Chairman Kalenin announced that all items on the agenda had been discussed and the Assembly was adjourned. At that time, the entire venue erupted in thunderous cheers of "Long live the Soviet Union, long live the Red Army, long live Stalin, Molotov, and Voroshilov!" (TASS, 31st)

### Soviet Union Violates Promises; US Prepares to Protest; "Flint" Flies German Flag; Departed Norwegian Territorial Waters Southward Yesterday

Washington - Secretary of State Hull reiterated yesterday that the US government attaches great importance to the "Flint" case. Although Hull did not specify what actions the government would take, it is widely believed that the government will lodge a strong protest with the Soviet Union, questioning the Soviet government's violation of its promises when the United States recognized the Soviet government in 1933. State Department officials expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the Soviet government's handling of the incident. The Soviet government has neither provided the US government with information about the matter, nor allowed the German side to send the ship and its crew to Germany. The actions of the administrative authorities in this decision, and the strong protest lodged with the Soviet government in 1935, questioning the Soviet government's violation of its promises not to interfere in the American system of government when the United States recognized the Soviet government, have attracted special attention from all sectors. (Associated Press, 31st)

Washington - Regarding the case of the American cargo ship "Flint" being detained, the State Department received a telegram from Chargé d'Affaires Kirk in Germany, stating that German Foreign Ministry officials had verbally notified that there was still no news about the ship's whereabouts. Secretary of State Hull also told the press that the State Department was carefully studying various issues raised by the case, especially the issue of ensuring the safety of American ships and crew in the future, but he declined to explain how to guarantee it. In addition, the State Department received a telegram from Minister to Norway Mrs. Harriman, reporting that according to reliable semi-official sources, the "Flint" flew the German flag and arrived at Tromsø Island in Norway at 1:00 PM today, and then continued south at 4:00 PM, but this news has not been confirmed by the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. Also, according to MacDonald, General Manager of the Winchaw Company in Chicago, the "Flint" carried a batch of ventilators manufactured by his company, which were to be transported to Ireland for use in air-raid shelters to circulate air. (Havas, 30th)

Stockholm, Sweden - According to a report by Mr. Jieben, a special correspondent for a certain German newspaper, the "Flint" arrived at Tromsø, Norway yesterday. Jieben said that he boarded the "Flint" for inspection at 1:00 PM yesterday. The American crew members are still on board. The ship left here at 4:00 PM yesterday at the request of the German authorities. The crew members of the British ship "Stongan," which the "Flint" previously rescued, were ordered by German sailors to disembark when the ship passed through Tromsø. It is widely believed that the reason why German sailors sailed the ship back to Tromsø was to abandon the American crew members there, so that they could freely dispose of the ship. (Associated Press, 31st)

### German Press Attacks America's Dual Neutral Attitude

Berlin - According to the German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, "Foreign Affairs Communications," America's neutral attitude is clearly dual, i.e., the attitudes taken towards British armed merchant ships and submarines, and towards Germany's detention of the American ship "Flint," are obviously different, and biased towards the British side. It also stated that the American ship "Flint" is now being escorted by 30 German sailors, and it is believed that the ship will be able to pass through the British naval blockade line in the North Sea and enter a German port. (Associated Press, 31st)

### Britain Presents Evidence to US Regarding the Athenia Incident

London - British Ambassador to the United States, Lothian, following instructions from the British government, explained the following evidence to the US government regarding the sinking of the Athenia: (1) The Athenia did not carry gold, silver, or bonds, nor did it carry guns, ammunition, or explosives. (2) The sinking of the Athenia was not caused by contact with British mines, bombing by British submarines, shelling by British destroyers, or internal explosions, but according to evidence obtained by the British government, it was sunk by a submarine. (3) The Athenia was not armed. (4) The United States had no intention of converting the Athenia into an armed merchant cruiser or any other offensive weapon upon completion of this voyage. (5) The Athenia's Chief Officer, Copeland, has sworn to a statement proving that he never discussed the issue of guns on board with passenger Anderson, and that there were no guns and fire equipment loaded on board the ship. (Reuters, 31st)

### Germany and Latvia Sign Immigration Agreement; German Residents Begin to Withdraw

Latvian Capital City - The German-Latvian Immigration Agreement was signed here yesterday by German Minister to Latvia Gütz and Latvian Minister of Justice Japšitis.

### New York World's Fair Closed Yesterday; Reopens Next May

New York - Since its opening in April last year, the New York World's Fair has attracted no fewer than 26 million visitors from all over the world. It is now scheduled to close tonight and reopen on May 25 next year, but it is generally expected that the number of countries participating in the exhibition at that time may be less than this year. The newspapers said that the holding of the World's Fair is sufficient to symbolize international sincerity. (Havas, 31st)

### Indian National Congress Dissatisfied with Viceroy's Remarks; Two More Provincial Governments Resign

Bombay - The Congress governments of Bombay Province and this Har Province have resigned, now believing that it is all due to dissatisfaction with the Indian Governor's recent remarks on the status of the Indian Dominion. According to the Governor's remarks, published in a White Paper, it said that the British government, at the end of the war, was willing to consult with representatives of Indian social parties and groups and princes, in order to obtain their assistance and cooperation, and to make the desired revisions to the Indian government's federal system.

(6) Index of Attitudes of Participating Countries in the Midst of Chaos

After the last European War, the countries of the world learned various lessons; and in the diplomatic sphere, the biggest were two points: one was opposing pre-war secret diplomacy, and the other was opposing countries concluding alliances separately, forming mutual confrontations. The League of Nations, which was produced after the war, included the remaining missions of eliminating these two points in its tasks. The latter point was completely abolished because of the collusion of the German-Japanese-Italian group; they also all withdrew from the League of Nations. As for the former point, before the British Foreign Secretary Eden resigned last spring, diplomacy among the remaining countries, except for the group of invaders, could more or less follow the path of the League of Nations and proceed with a dignified posture. However, as soon as Eden resigned, British Prime Minister Chamberlain pursued secret diplomacy. Whether secret diplomacy has been particularly active this year is a merit or a crime has been specifically proven by this great war. At the same time, the truth is not within the scope of my article, so I will not say it now. What I want to point out here is that as the situation developed to the eve of this war, the rampantness of secret diplomacy in Europe had reached a terrible level. Therefore, even though the war has now been considered to have broken out, it is still completely impossible for us to thoroughly understand the true attitudes of various countries. In addition, besides secret diplomacy, there has also been a particularly developed activity of the propaganda weapons of various countries in recent years. This has added another layer of cover to all international activities, forming the current chaos and uncertainty of the truth.

However, precisely because of this, we have a greater need to look at the truth behind the bewildering surface of the kaleidoscope. Below, based on the existing data, I will use personal judgment and the results of discussions with everyone as tools to first try to draw a rough outline of this point. Of course, this is not writing history, and I plan to supplement it at any time in the future if I gain anything, perhaps by correcting it.

First, Germany's Invasion of Poland

A year ago, at this time, Hitler instigated and helped Poland, when Czechoslovakia ceded the Sudetenland to Germany, also took advantage of the fire to loot and forcibly ceded a piece of Czech territory near Taisun. In the spring, when Polish Foreign Minister Beck visited Germany, Hitler proposed the annexation of the Free City of Danzig in person. After Poland accepted the British guarantee of security, Hitler began to woo Poland. After the signing of the Anglo-Polish Mutual Assistance Agreement, he also strengthened his efforts to woo Poland through Mussolini, and used considerable intimidation. At this time, it had reached the eve of this war.

However, like a drama that has been closed for a long, long, long time, the curtain suddenly opened when everyone was waiting impatiently; and unexpectedly, what appeared on the stage was a German invasion of Poland!

Germany invades Poland? - This is unimaginable! It is something that has a hundred disadvantages and no advantages for Germany! In terms of the relationship between Germany and Poland, Hitler, like Zhuge Liang, shed tears and beheaded Ma Su; in terms of the relationship between Britain, France, and Germany, and the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany, from now on, he is riding on the back of a tiger.

In terms of diplomatic operation, what Britain and France most hoped for was a German invasion of Poland. Germany has been enduring for the past few months, repeatedly postponing the annexation of Danzig, in order to guard against triggering a full-scale war with Poland. Poland dared to be excessively stiff, and even more fearless, because it was determined that Germany would not use force against it. Many observers may have disputed the evolution of other future international situations, but they are in unanimous agreement on this point: the possibility of compromise exceeds the possibility of war. But the fact is ultimately the fact, and Germany finally invaded Poland! (To be continued)

### Xiangyin, the Gateway to Northern Hunan, Suffers Disastrous Bombing by Japanese Aircraft; People's Self-Defense Strength Has Increased

Changsha dispatch: Xiangyin, bordered by rivers and lakes, is one of the most poetic and picturesque cities in the lakeside area of northern Hunan. The city is oval in shape, with a circumference of only about four li. However, the city is surrounded by weeping willows. Every spring and summer, the trees are lush and the rivers and lakes rise. From a distance, Xiangyin City looks like a piece of moss in the middle of the water, a green duckweed: "Rainbow dyke shadows east and west water, mirror lake light up and down the sky," "Light green double lakes generate evening waves, residual red eight scenes reside in the setting sun," "Distant harbor sails collect thousands of acres of blue, the setting sun shines on a river of red." These are all illustrations of Xiangyin left to us by our predecessors.

After the great fire in Changsha, a part of the disaster-stricken people of Changsha gathered in Xiangyin, making the Xiangyin city, which was located on the lakeside close to the front line, become prosperous again. For more than half a year this year, there was peace in northern Hunan. In addition, since the highways and railways were destroyed, the only traffic to and from northern Hunan was by waterway along the Xiang River. In this way, Xiangyin restored its past prosperity due to the war, and Xiangyin City also appeared particularly active. Xiangyin, which was in prosperity and revival, had just passed the Dragon Boat Festival in the old lunar calendar (June 21). After paying tribute to Qu Yuan, the doctor of the Three Questions, at Miluo River, who would have thought that on June 23 and 24, 15 Japanese planes each day would use Xiangyin City in the civilian area as a bombing target? Because the air defense facilities were simple and equivalent to nothing, and because the urban area was surrounded by water, there was nowhere to hide, the entire Xiangyin urban area was bombed and burned to the ground in five rounds of crazy bombing by Japanese planes for two days. Eighty or ninety percent of all houses in the city were bombed and burned. Residents, families, and even entire streets were bombed and burned, or buried alive in the rubble. The number of civilian casualties reached 3,000. The amount of loss exceeded the record of any city or town in Hunan Province that has suffered an air raid.

More than a month after Xiangyin was bombed, although the main streets have been cleaned up, thatched cottages and wooden houses have been built on some of the rubble. Some of the refugees are running their meager businesses to continue their weak lives. However, after surveying the entire area, I deeply feel that the losses suffered are far greater than the great fire in Changsha in terms of proportion. The only large building in the city, the Confucian Temple, which was splendidly built by the big merchant Huang Hongda, was also hit by several bombs, with dilapidated walls, broken tiles, broken beams and broken bricks, which was a sad sight.

The commercial district of Xiangyin was originally in the city. Since it was destroyed by Japanese aircraft, it has moved to the side of Wenxing Pagoda, about three miles outside the east gate, which was originally a scenic area. It continues to shoulder the important task of connecting the front and rear lines. Wenxing Pagoda has seven levels. Next to the pagoda, there are two lakes, east and west, with a bridge in the middle, called Wenxing Bridge. Looking north from the pagoda, Dongting Lake for eight hundred li is all in sight.

There are three major rivers flowing through Xiangyin County: the Xiang, the Zi, and the Miluo Rivers. The Zi River runs horizontally east of the county, dividing the north and south, while the Zi River runs vertically for more than 200 li in the west. Because the area is near the river and lake, there are fertile fields and embroidered fields connected to each other, which is a famous rice-producing area. It is said that Xiangyin County alone, in addition to supplying its own 710,000 people, usually exports 800,000 shi. This year is a rare harvest in 20 years. At least 1.5 million shi can be left over. Together with the lakeside counties, it can produce 8 million to 10 million shi more, providing food for the 2 million heroic soldiers who are fighting for the survival of the nation and the personality of the country for the next year, and we can "rest easy".

Xiangyin is the hometown of Zuo Zongtang and Guo Songtao. It has always attached importance to both military affairs and human culture. Especially military affairs, because of the development of the people's spirit, such as courage and willingness to take responsibility, if we can take advantage of the situation and strengthen their national and national consciousness, it is indeed a hope for the country. Unfortunately, in the past, the local authorities did not implement military service in a down-to-earth manner. Those with money bought strong men to replace military service with money. Those with power even shortened the age of 18 to 25 to under 18 and over 26, and increased the age under 40 to over 46. In this way, they evaded military service, so that those without money or power mostly hesitated and stayed away. "Drawing strong men" thus became "catching strong men." After the war spread to Jiangxi and Hubei, the counties of Hunan Province re-established the "Self-Defense Corps," but the funds for the Self-Defense Corps were mostly temporarily apportioned to the people every month, rather than planned as a whole, resulting in many people being hired to collect self-defense funds, with many malpractices and frequent disputes. As a result, "self-defense" became "self-disturbance." This phenomenon continued until the Japanese army invaded Yueyang and Xiangyin had become the first line approaching the front line before it gradually changed. Especially the people. In the bloody lessons of the two rapid bombings of the county seat, they increased their further understanding of the Japanese invasion. Not only will they never forget it, but they will also pass on this painful experience to every descendant, becoming a story to be vigilant about. Since then, the difficulty of conscription has been reduced, and there have been no more disputes over the funds of the Self-Defense Corps. The people have also voluntarily taken on self-defense work, because they have all understood the obligations and responsibilities that every citizen should fulfill.

If the Japanese army wants to use Dongting Lake and the Xiang River to attack the hinterland of Hunan Province, then Xiangyin is the place that both sides must contend for. However, here, every river, every harbor, has been blockaded by the Chinese army, every mound, every mountain, has solid fortifications and bunkers of the Chinese army, and every man and woman has consciously engaged in practical work to protect their hometown. Therefore, the recent northern Hunan front can be said to be as solid as gold.

### Subei Yancheng Lost and Regained; Chinese Army Lures Japanese Army Deep; Japanese Army Suffers Great Losses

Xinghua dispatch: The Japanese army that invaded Yancheng from Funing had about 600 or 700 infantry and artillery soldiers, and two iron-shelled small steamers and more than 20 civilian boats, advancing along the Fan Gong Dike and Chuanchang River by land and water, and violently harassing Yancheng. On the 17th, they broke through the Chinese army defense lines at Caoyankou and Shanggang. On the morning of the 18th, they approached Xinxingchang, north of Yancheng. The Chinese army believed that the Japanese army was coming with great momentum, and the positions between Gouandung and Shanggang were all destroyed by its artillery fire, so they changed their strategy to lure the enemy deep, transferred their forces to the east and west sides of the Fan Gong Dike, and encircled and annihilated them in one fell swoop. However, in order to prevent reinforcements from Funing, on the 18th, the Chinese army on both sides launched a fierce attack on the rear of the Japanese army at the same time. The strongholds of Shanggang Caoyankou and Gouandung were successively recovered. The advancing Japanese army ignored the rear and continued to advance at the risk. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 18th, they broke through the Chinese army defense line at Xinxingchang again. That night, they sneaked into Yancheng, but the Chinese army had already distributed its forces in the suburbs of Yancheng in advance. The people in the city had been evacuated a few days ago, and all the utensils had been moved out. Even the doors and windows and floors had been removed. Ten houses out of ten were empty, without a single object, and the city walls were demolished, making it easy to attack and difficult to defend. Therefore, after the Japanese army wanted to occupy Yancheng, it actually only obtained an empty city, without any gain. On the contrary, because they were surrounded on all sides, they felt a great threat. In anger, they set fire to many civilian houses. The Chinese military authorities had already planned to order the various armies to annihilate the Japanese army that had entered Yancheng. However, in panic, the Japanese army occupied Yancheng for one night, and suddenly fled Yancheng at about 3:00 p.m. on the 19th. It was reported that they fled to the north and northeast coast of Nanbeiyang, or detoured back to Funing. The Chinese military authorities immediately ordered the troops stationed along the way to intercept them, and all the plans and the Yancheng County Reserve Team had entered Yancheng at about 5:00 p.m. that day. This time, the Japanese army fled, and the iron-shelled steamers and civilian boats they drove were all intercepted by the Chinese army and had nowhere to escape.

In addition, it was reported that the Japanese army automatically fled north at about 3:00 p.m. on the 19th. When they passed near Shanggang, they were fiercely intercepted by the Chinese army headquarters, and were also attacked from the rear by the Chinese army pursuit troops. A fierce battle took place at this time. The Chinese army on the west side also participated in the encirclement and suppression. Although the Japanese army charged straight ahead, they were eventually surrounded by the Chinese army on many sides. After a fierce battle for four or five hours, because it was already dusk, the Japanese army broke through the Chinese defense line in different directions and fled north separately, but they had already been defeated. It is estimated that about 100 Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, and more than 100 were injured. The Chinese army also destroyed two of their iron boats, captured a large number of military supplies, and seized a cannon. A remnant of the Japanese army fled east to Haihezhen, and another fled to Funing. The Chinese army is chasing them. The Chinese army re-entered Yancheng on the 20th, and the telephones have also been repaired. Personnel from various agencies have returned to the city to work. This time, the Japanese army's invasion of Yancheng suffered heavy losses, which was really not worth the loss.

It was also reported that after the autumn flood in northern Jiangsu, the Japanese army used small warships and rubber boats to divide their troops along the Grand Canal and Ze Lake to wreak havoc. Gaoyou and Baoying successively fell. The Chinese side lacked heavy weapons and lost and recovered them many times. On October 14, more than 300 Japanese soldiers, carrying small steel cannons and light and heavy machine guns, suddenly attacked Yancheng. The defenders, upon hearing the news, resisted desperately and fought for three days and nights. In the end, because the Japanese artillery fire was fierce, the city walls were cracked, and then there were street battles. They withdrew to the outskirts to await reinforcements. Commander Li rushed to the scene and led Brigade Commander Sun of the Security Brigade and Zhang Brigade to personally lead Chen's regiment and Staff Officer Ma to rush to the scene overnight. The artillery fire on both sides could be heard dozens of miles away. After a fierce battle until 3:00 p.m., more than half of the Japanese soldiers were killed or injured, and they abandoned the battle and retreated towards Fufuning. Shanggang, Yancheng, was recovered. The Japanese army was frightened upon hearing the news and heard that they were abandoning the Gao and Bao trends.

### Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education Bans the Unauthorized Establishment of Middle Schools; Relocation of Addresses Must Also Be Approved

(Lishui dispatch) The Zhejiang Provincial Government has long stipulated that the establishment, change, or relocation of middle schools should be handled after being approved by the Department of Education. No enrollment shall be conducted before approval. Recently, some counties have established schools without following the regulations, and the Department of Education has separately banned them. In the future, if any county establishes secondary schools or branch schools, or high and junior high school student practice schools, or relocates to other places to enroll students without reporting to the department for approval, the county shall investigate and ban them in accordance with the regulations.

A Review and Prospect of Mass Education Centers

In the 24th year, the Implementation Plan for the Popularization of Mass Education Standards in County Rice Centers was promulgated. Zhejiang Province promulgated the Matters Needing Attention for the Establishment of Mass Education Centers in Counties and Cities in the 18th year, the Work Standards for Mass Education Centers in Counties and Cities in the 24th year, and the Regulations for Mass Education Centers in Counties and Cities in the 28th year. Other provinces and cities, such as the Measures for the Establishment of Mass Education Centers in Counties promulgated by Hebei Province, the Outline of Measures for the Preparatory Establishment of Mass Education Centers in Counties and Cities promulgated by Guangdong Province, the Outline of Measures for the Popularization of Mass Education Centers in Counties and Cities promulgated by Guangxi Province, and the Basic Requirements for County Mass Education Facilities promulgated by Yunnan Province. Provincial Mass Education Center Establishment General Rules, Nanjing City's Promulgated Outline of Measures for the Capital Mass Education Experimental Zone, etc., have detailed regulations for the establishment and facilities of mass education centers. In terms of social opinions,. Domestic educational magazines, such as Education Magazine, Chinese Education Circle, Teaching and Learning, Education and the Masses, Mass Education Quarterly, Mass Education Newsletter, and Shandong Mass Education Monthly, all publish articles on mass education centers, which are sufficient to represent the opinions of the general public. Education and the Masses and Shandong Mass Education Monthly have also published special issues on mass education centers to provide for discussions in various aspects. Mass education books include the Mass Education Center Implementation Method (edited by Lin), Education Center (edited by Peng), and Mass Education Center in Jiangsu (edited by Zong), etc. Other special investigations and studies include Huang Shang's survey of the organization of national public and private mass education centers, Wang Yucheng's survey of the organization of mass education centers in counties with reduced speed, Zhao Jiyu's survey of the organization of mass education centers in Zhejiang counties and cities, Zhao Yuan's survey of the results of soliciting opinions on the number of staff in mass education centers, Gu Shouen's statistics on the mass education center business in Jiangsu counties, and Jiang Ci'en's statistics on the mass education center business in Zhejiang counties. As for the progress of experimental work in various mass education centers and the promotion of general undertakings, it is even more difficult to list them all. In short, in the vigorous mass education movement in China, we cannot but say that the promotion of mass education centers is the most powerful.

Past Difficulties and Shortcomings: Mass education is a new undertaking, and mass education centers are newly established institutions. The difficulties of running a new undertaking with a newly established institution are conceivable. Moreover, the scope of mass education is extremely broad, the target of implementation is extremely complex, and the aspects involved are extremely numerous, making it even more difficult for the actual staff of mass education centers to know where to start. In addition, the personnel engaged in mass education centers rarely receive professional training, and are extremely poor in the beliefs, knowledge, and skills that should be possessed. Therefore, the difficulties and shortcomings of mass education centers occur anytime and anywhere, and we need to overcome and remedy them. Now let's give two examples. One is the Overview of Social Education in Sichuan from the 25th to the 27th years, printed by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education. Regarding the lack of achievements of mass education centers, the following factors can be obtained:

(1) Lack of organizers: The current employees have neither research nor experience in running the masses.

(2) Lack of work plans in handling affairs, resulting in following the old ways and perfunctorily.

(3) The handling time is completely spent in the center, so that it is impossible to launch mass education work in a county or district.

(4) Most mass education centers have very little funding. In addition to salary expenses, there is a lack of funding to promote the business.

(5) The equipment of each center is too poor, far from the standard, and lacks sufficient tools to promote mass education.

(6) Local governments have not formulated standards and methods for supervising, assessing, leading, and promoting work.

(7) Local governments have failed to recognize the function of mass education centers themselves, and neither lead nor care.

The other is Zhu Zhixian's summary of the criticisms of mass education center facilities from many mass education experts and mass education people, which are nothing more than the following ten or so types:

(1) The facilities are mostly for entertainment purposes and have little educational significance. (2) The facilities are too complicated and mistakenly regard propaganda activities as educational purposes. (3) The work is too scattered. (4) The business has no center. (5) The teaching area is too large. (6) There is no fixed target. (7) The facilities are mostly empty and do not meet the needs. (8) Most of the organizers cannot recognize the core of the problem. (9) They pay too much attention to the inside of the center and ignore the outside. (10) They fail to really go to the people. (11) Most mass education centers are located in cities. (12) They cannot train and organize the masses in a timely manner. (13) They only pay attention to the development of quantity and less to the improvement of quality. (14) The work plan is mostly formulated by the主管.

The two examples given above, one is published by the educational administrative organ, and the other is published by the people engaged in mass education in various places, which can well represent the general difficulties and shortcomings of mass education centers.

### Recent News from the Chongqing Municipal Mass Education Center

2. General Work - In addition to the central work - eliminating illiteracy, other general work includes assisting self-government, promoting production, improving health, improving customs, guiding entertainment, and wartime rear work.

### Xiangdao Ball Report; Nanhua South Wins Scott; Nanhua Hua Draws with Police

(Hong Kong dispatch) In the Hong Kong Zu Wu A-League, the Nanhua brothers went their separate ways. The South team defeated Scott 5-1 without much effort. The Hua team fought hard against the police, and drew 4-4 in a storm. In yesterday's game, several players from Nanhua suddenly "went on strike." Li Tiansheng from the South team and Yang Shuipan from the Hua team were both absent. This was due to friction in the understanding of the association, which led to this episode. The South team went to So Kon Po. Because Tiansheng was tired of duty, Liang Rongzhao was transferred to the left inner guard and Liu Songsheng was appointed as the right forward. This arrangement was still appropriate. The Scott team did not match the original plan. Goalkeeper Deng Qin was not seen, and still by Chiller. The three new generals, Manaho Road, Saroni, and Jianwu, also. He had only met Shangjian once, so the entire front line was not as complete as when he fought the police last week. Therefore, our army was hit head-on and suffered a crushing defeat. According to the first round of last year, Nanhua defeated Scott 10-0, but in the second round, Nanhua was humiliated 0-1. This time, before the meeting, it was difficult to determine who would win. Scott's combat ability is very mysterious. No matter whether the opponent is strong or weak, most of them end in a draw. But yesterday's answer was 5-1, and Nanhua South again reported a victory.

### Finance: Four Days of Continuous Loosening; Foreign Exchange Market Suddenly Reverses; Japanese Banks Begin Aggressively Buying; Demand Exceeds Supply, Market Conditions Tighten

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the exchange rate announced by HSBC. The situation in the unofficial British and American exchange markets, after four days of sharp loosening, suddenly turned around. Generally, those who intentionally bought in began to take the opportunity to settle, and their lineup was very strong, so the reaction was particularly strong. The five-penny mark for British gold was briefly broken. The market opened flat in the morning, and was slightly firmer due to light trading. However, although there were repeated sell-offs from foreign telegrams and Chinese businesses thereafter, it was unexpected that HSBC's appetite suddenly became strong, and coupled with favorable buying intentions, the market became tight and soft. Subsequently, Japanese banks, such as Zheng Jin, and foreign firms began to buy, and American banks such as Chase Manhattan covered shorts and bought, so the buying trend gradually expanded and tightened step by step. Until around 2 p.m., British gold had retreated into the five-penny mark, to 4 pence 96875, and the US exchange rate had fallen to 8.1875 yuan. Finally, after HSBC and others searched extensively, the number of chips felt lacking. Afterwards, yarn and flower dealers came to the market to supply, and the situation slightly loosened, with British gold at 5 pence 0625 and the US exchange rate at 8.4375 yuan. However, at the close, British gold was still reported at 5 pence 015625 and the US exchange rate was 8.34375 yuan, a rebound of 234375 compared to the previous day, and a softening of 40625 for the US dollar. Futures trading was very rare, and the trend was like the spot market. Trading was still brisk throughout the day.

American Banks Also Covered Shorts

In the morning, the London long-term for British gold was 0625 recently and 3125 in the long term, the New York silver price was reduced by one-fifth, the London raw gold was stable, and the exchange rate for British against US and against France was still flat, and against Shanghai it rose by 1875. The US against British and against France were all flat, and against Shanghai it rose by two jiao five fen. The central exchange rates announced by the banks were as before. The banks opened the spot selling price in the morning at 5 pence 25 for British gold and 8.75 yuan for the US exchange rate, with no change from the previous close. After opening, the situation was slightly firmer, with British gold called over 5 pence 28125 and the US exchange rate called over 8.78125 yuan, but there was little trading. The exchange rate announced by HSBC did not move, and the silver balance tax was announced to be more than half a point. Thereafter, although foreign telegrams and speculators sold, HSBC took the opportunity to absorb them, and favorable factors also bought in, so the market conditions tended to tighten and soften. HSBC and favorable parties bought spot British gold from foreign telegrams and Chinese businesses at 5 pence 25 and 1875, respectively. Then, favorable parties again took in spot US exchange from American banks at 8.6875 yuan and 625, respectively. Later, Japanese banks and Zheng Jin followed suit with aggressive buying, and importers also did not buy, and it was heard that American banks also covered shorts, so the market situation became softer. Zheng Jin and foreign firms bought spot British gold from foreign banks from 5 pence 1875, tightened to 09375, and spot US exchange from 8.625 yuan, softened to 4375. At noon, it continued to tighten step by step, extending to 5 pence 0625, and the US exchange rate was only 8.375 yuan. It was heard that the state after closing was even softer, with British gold tightening to 5 pence 03125 and the US exchange rate softening to 8.3125 yuan.

British Gold Once Entered the Five-Penny Mark

The market continued to tighten step by step after the initial opening of the afternoon market. First, Japanese banks came to act again, and British gold even broke into the five-penny mark, once calling over 4 pence 96875, and the US exchange rate also called over 8.1875 yuan. After entering, it was said that a certain British bank lacked legal tender head positions, and the Chinese yarn and flower dealers took advantage of the high price to sell, and it slightly rebounded to 5 pence 0625 for British gold and 8.4375 yuan for the US exchange rate. However, Juzi late received the bank's spot selling price, and British gold softened again to 5 pence 015625, and the US exchange rate also tightened to 8.34375 yuan. The November British gold was 4 pence 984375, and the US exchange rate was 8.28125 yuan, compared with the previous day's spot British average of 234375, and the US was all hardened by 40625.

### Following Foreign Exchange, the Gold Market Also Rebounds; Re-enters the 3,700 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's spot gold (shà chì) market conditions regained its luster as the foreign exchange market softened. The gains for the day offset the losses of the previous day. However, the market opened with a sharp drop of 46 yuan, opening at a low price of 3,610 yuan. This was because the foreign exchange market was still soft at this time, and a certain money exchange business was selling with all its strength. However, the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened sharply, which boosted the morale of buyers. Gold shops and securities firms aggressively bought without stopping, and the Hong Kong businesses also had a good appetite. Also, near noon, a certain money exchange business that had sold in the morning also entered the market to buy back, and the price soared to 3,705 yuan. By noon, it had fallen slightly to 3,697 yuan. In the afternoon, the buying was still strong, and it rose again to a high peak of 3,755 yuan. It was not until the foreign exchange market slightly hardened again that some daily profit-takers spit out, and the price broke into the 3,700 yuan mark. Finally, because foreign exchange was still tight, the market closed at 3,725 yuan. As a result, it rose 60 yuan compared with the previous day. Trading was brisk throughout the day, with around 1,800 to 1,900 taels traded. Gold jewelry shops finally listed a large five yuan increase, and customs gold and other prices remained flat.

Shà Chì Recovers 69 Yuan

From the morning, the atmosphere was such that money exchange businesses such as Qian Tai were pressing down prices to sell. At the same time, buyers lacked appetite. Bǎi actually pressed down 46 yuan, and the money exchange business sold 30 taels to the Qian Tai gold shop for 3,610 yuan. After a while, a certain gold shop came to pull up the price, and it rose by 20 yuan. A certain gold shop bought 20 taels from a peer for 3,630 yuan. Those who came to buy later were slightly lacking, and the price was pressed down slightly to 3,615 yuan. Then, because the foreign exchange report was tight, and it was heard that HSBC was buying, it suddenly aroused the excitement of speculators, and securities firms and gold shops competed to buy. At the same time, customers also came to drag in, so the price rose by 55 yuan. A gold jewelry shop bought 50 taels of cash from a gold shop for 3,670 yuan. Later, some retail bulls sold, and the price fell back to 3,655 yuan. However, soon after, because the foreign exchange report was soft, it soared again to 3,680 yuan. Subsequently, because securities firms came out to take profits, the price fell again to 3,655 yuan. Around 11:00 a.m., it was heard that the foreign exchange tightness was intensifying, and the atmosphere was rising. A certain money exchange business that had sold out in the morning suddenly came back to buy, and broke out of the 3,700 yuan mark. A certain money exchange business escaped the securities firm for 30 taels for 3,705 yuan. By the time of the close, it had fallen slightly. The money exchange business did 50 taels mutually, with an afternoon price of 3,697 yuan. It was heard that the price after the close was due to foreign exchange softening, and a certain money exchange business and securities firm bought a total of 30 taels of cash from the gold shop at a price of 3,720 yuan. The initial opening in the afternoon was strong, 20 yuan higher than the off-market price. The money exchange business bought 30 taels from the securities firm for 3,740 yuan. Then, because a certain money exchange business continued to buy, and the foreign exchange British gold reached five pence, it rose another 15 yuan. The money exchange business did 50 taels mutually for 3,755 yuan. It was heard that the foreign exchange rebounded slightly, and the long parties who had made profits came out, and at the same time, the gold jewelry shops also sold short quite actively, so the price plunged straight down 65 yuan. The gold jewelry shop bought 30 taels from the money exchange business for 3,690 yuan. After entering, because the foreign exchange softened slightly again, the securities firm then came to pull up the price, and it rose again by 30 yuan. The securities firm bought 10 taels from the gold shop for 3,725 yuan, with a late closing price. As a result, it recovered 69 yuan compared to the previous day, which was a rebound after falling for four consecutive days for a total of nearly 166 yuan. It was heard that after the close, a certain gold shop bought 10 taels from the gold jewelry shop, and the price father raised five yuan, for 3,730 yuan. Throughout the day, the price fluctuated by 145 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold shop's brand-name gold was 10 yuan higher than Shà Chì, and the purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Was Also Listed Up Five Yuan

The initial exchange price for jewelry gold per tael at the gold jewelry shop was still 370 yuan at Da Tong Hang. Then, at 11:10 a.m., it was listed up five yuan. At 2:05 p.m., it was father up five yuan. At 3:15 p.m., it fell back five yuan. As a result, it was up five yuan. Da Hui Hang changed the listing to 375 yuan. The new peers were the same as the above price, and the purchase price had to be reduced by 15 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Rise One After Another

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw many customers take the opportunity to absorb them because they had fallen quite a bit in recent days. The demand for British and American gold pounds and gold notes turned strong, and the market price rose sharply. The Hong Kong note rose sharply due to the tightening of the Hong Kong exchange rate. The rise of the Netherlands note and the Canada note was more moderate. The demand for French francs, Singapore, and Annam notes was not strong, and the market price was stable. The supply of Japanese gold notes suddenly increased, and the evening market was 1 yuan 3 jiao and 09 li. The trading of Korean notes turned rare, and the evening market was 1 yuan and 09 fen. Yesterday's market price was 1 yuan for British gold pounds, 1 yuan and 5 jiao for British gold notes, 5 jiao for American gold pounds, 5 jiao and 7 fen for American gold notes, 1 jiao for Hong Kong notes, 5 fen for Netherlands notes, 2 jiao for Canada notes, and other currencies did not change.

### The "Harmonious" Hua Xing Jiao Notes

Since the establishment of Hua Xing Bank, it has intended to control the economy in the occupied areas. Unfortunately, the people's hearts have not died. Except for forced matters, such as paying donations and taxes, which must be settled with the bank's banknotes, the rest still uses legal tender. In addition to yuan banknotes, the bank also issues jiao notes. The front is as shown in the attached picture, and the back is printed with the words "One Jiao" and "10 Cents". The four corners are divided into hollow "I" and "One" characters. Both sides are green, and the back is slightly lighter. The printing pattern, design, and font are known at a glance to be "harmonious". (Pure)

### Securities: Grade C Re-enters the Gate

Yesterday's unofficial securities market gradually became weak in its struggle. Some bulls continued to come out, and Defu Lianhe and others still sold, so although Grades C and E had rediscovered the high price of 50 yuan, they trended downward. At the same time, foreign exchange shrank, gold rose, and people's hearts were also slightly tired. Therefore, Grade C actually broke the 9 yuan price again. Environmental news and rumors varied, and people's hearts were therefore dazed. In the initial opening yesterday morning, due to the eagerness of buyers and the raising of prices by many parties, the opening price of Grades C and E was 50 yuan. However, the supply from the sellers did not stop, and the wind suddenly turned, gradually trending downward. The difference between high and low at noon was as much as eight jiao. Therefore, when gold turned up in the afternoon, the bond market felt more and more powerless to go down three or five jiao again. As a result, it fell back five jiao and a half to eight jiao and a half. The total number of transactions was about one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Close Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 58.95 58.35 58.25 Down 0.85

Unified B 51.10 50.55 50.55 Down 0.75

Unified C 50.00 48.85 48.90 Down 0.65

Unified D 49.00 48.60 48.60 Down 0.65

Unified E 50.00 48.95 49.10 Down 0.60

Stock Trading: 50 shares of stock were traded on the exchange, with a price of 29 yuan and 2 jiao and a half.

London, 30th telegram, today's listed prices of stocks of various British companies in the Far East rose uniformly. The price of the Mccallie Bank stock rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 7 pounds and 15 shillings. The price of the HSBC Bank stock rose by 1 pound each, the price of the stocks registered in London rose to 78 pounds, and the price of the stocks registered in Hong Kong rose to 79 pounds. The price of the Yulei Bank stock rose by 5 shillings to 11 pounds. The price of the open Ping Coal Mine bearer stocks was 1 shilling and 9 pence, and the price was 15 shillings and 6 pence. The price of the Gulag Green Rubber stock rose by 4 pence to 10 and 6 shillings and 10 pence, and the rest did not move. London, 30th telegram, today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debts rose slightly. The price of the Beining Railway Bonds rose sharply by 4 pounds, and the price was 47 pounds. The prices of the Reconstruction (British Gold) and Longhai Railway bonds each rose by 1 pound, the former was 26 pounds and the latter was 9 pounds. The rest remained stable.

### Yarn: The Yarn Market Turns Stable

The yarn market, which had fallen sharply the previous day, showed a slight turnaround and recovery yesterday. At the same time, although customers did not purchase in large batches, the retail transactions of Hong Kong customers were more active, and people's hearts felt more stable. The trend was slightly consolidated, but after the price increase, large households still had a strong intention to sell. Judging from the market situation, it was not far from a hovering state. As for the meeting point, there were more customers gathered in the exchange, so trading was more active at the new site. However, the market prices differed, giving more opportunities for scalpers. The transaction price of 20-count Double Horse on the exchange board was up to 639 yuan, but the price on the New World board was only 632 yuan. By the time of the close, the price on the exchange had fallen back to 632 yuan, but on the other side it had rebounded to 637 yuan. It can be imagined that the market prices in the two places were mixed and disorderly. This situation is ultimately not a blessing for the yarn industry.

In the morning, Guangbang customers came one after another, all in the exchange. Peers began to trade 10 bales of 20-count Earth for 610 yuan, a drop of more than 10 yuan. Then, as customers had some intention of buying, the momentum gradually rose, and 20-count Variant Horse rose from 628 yuan to 639 yuan. Later, as there were slightly more sellers at high prices, the price fell back. It was found that 685 bales were traded in half a day, and 345 bales were traded the previous day, for a total of 1,030 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose in the market, and the prices of Tian Nu and San Xing were flat and increased by five yuan, respectively. 750 pieces of export yarn were shipped to Tianjin today. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left:

Peers 470 Hong Kong 145

Jiangxi 20 Xiamen 40

Previous Day's Transactions 345 Total 1,030

Afternoon news was that foreign exchange had shrunk and people's hearts had been invigorated. The asking price for 20-count Double Horse was 647 yuan, and it was said that there was no buying. We will decide the winner tomorrow.

### Fire Machine Cotton Was Traded Yesterday; Sales Disks Showed No Movement Up or Down

Cotton trading showed a slight improvement, but although Chinese factories had a way, only Hongzhang Factory took in 1,000 bales of white cotton. Other factories were still lackluster, and Japanese factories were increasingly silent, so the market was still calm. As for the sales disk, it was about the same as the previous day. The source of Northern Jiangsu was again enthusiastic. There were 3,597 bales of Tonghua cotton and 270 bales of Beisha cotton arriving at the dock. The sales disk of spot cotton is recorded on the left:

Tongzhou Cotton 229.00 Peer 400 bales

129.80 400 bales

Tongzhou Cotton 130.00 Peer 200 bales

Tongzhou Packed 137.0. Peer 200 pieces

Fire Machine Cotton 22.50 Peer 800 bales

113.00 800 bales

Fire Machine Cotton 115.00 Hongzhang 1,000 bales

In addition, the foreign cotton trading in Shanghai was extremely sluggish due to the loosening of the exchange rate. Factories and peers were all adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Futures trading was also very light. All parties' thoughts were focused on the current changes in the exchange rate. If the current exchange rate can indeed stand stable, then foreign cotton trading may have a chance to turn around. I then the cotton market will be quiet for a normal period of time.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was very firm in the morning. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai both reported rising prices. The number of sales of piece goods has been increasing daily, so spot trading has become active, and trading among peers has also increased. European demand is also quite strong. As a result, the closing price was 4 pounds higher than the previous day. India's forecasts rose more than one rupee, Egypt rose more than ten pounds, and Liverpool rose three or five pence.

### Food: Arrivals Surge, Sales Clear; Japonica and Indica Are Difficult to Reinvigorate

After the Japonica rice market turned sluggish once in the afternoon market yesterday, the opening trend was weak yesterday. The arrivals from various districts suddenly surged, with three or four thousand bales of goods from Chang, Kun, Su, Jia, Qing, and Jiao, which made people feel discouraged. If the new Japonica is because the local stores are sluggish, and the arrivals are particularly large, and the rice quality is weak, it is not easy to defend for a long time. General customers do not agree with each other, and they urgently seek to sell goods, so the market is difficult to support, and the falling wind becomes more and more fierce. Until the close of the market, the market price has been shortened by seven jiao to one yuan compared with the previous market, and the transaction is still clear. It is estimated that Changxi Te japonica was traded for 30 yuan and 7 jiao, and the middle ones were 27 or 8 yuan. Su Tong Kunshan and other japonica were all around 27 or 8 yuan. Among the green seed kiln species and Bai Ge, except for Bai Ge, which was out of stock and had no market, the kiln and green species were even less asked about in this tired situation. At the close of the market, the high-quality Qing Jiao green seeds were decided from 30 yuan and 2 jiao and a half to 29 yuan, and the kiln species were decided from 29 yuan and 8 jiao to 28 yuan and a half. The rest, such as the broken yuan, were all oversupplied and fell by four or five jiao.

After Kexian (客秈) saw a rising wind due to the scarcity of goods, it did not soar at all during this week. However, after the news that the producing areas had opened up the borders spread before noon, it turned sluggish once. The market shape was weak yesterday morning, because Kexian had created this high price in recent days, first, because of the scarcity of goods, and second, because of the agitation of the minds of large hoarders. The feet were weak, and the local real stomach had already been guarded against, so except for the urgent need at that time, they were also watching with folded arms. When it suddenly became tired, people's hearts became more scrupulous, and they did not dare to ask about it if they did not cut through. As a result, whether it was retail or wholesale, the go-ahead was unusually wooden. The hoarders took this opportunity to throw out the goods in groups in order to avoid losses, so the market was filled with goods in an instant, and the situation fell step by step. By noon, the price had fallen by nearly one yuan, before the local stores moved out, and the market shape gradually tightened. Therefore, as a result, the price of each Kexian was 6 or 7 jiao lower than the previous market. According to statistics, more than 6,000 bags of Dukexian were traded in the whole city.

### The Flour Market Is Silent; High Prices and Sluggish Sales; Wheat Buyers and Sellers Standstill

The going-ahead of the current flour from the Nanyang gang has turned lazy, and the Beiyang gang is also rarely enthusiastic. Because the factory disk has increased after this street, escaping the stomach also does not take it, so the market has gradually flattened after rising. However, each factory is selling firmly because the raw material price is expensive at the moment. The floating stock of the returned goods in the market has also dried up early, so the transaction is even more silent. The total market transaction is only more than 20,000 bags. The factory disk continues to open at 7 yuan and 4 jiao, and those who directly distribute to customers still need 7 yuan and 5 jiao or 6 jiao, but it is not an official market situation.

The source of wheat is still scarce, and transportation in various places has been repeatedly difficult. Those who hold goods are inevitably hoarding, so the circulating goods in the market are decreasing day by day, and the factories also intend to suppress the price to buy, so the market is gradually in a standstill state. As a result, the factory's selling price has risen by another one jiao. It is estimated that 2,000 bags were purchased from the Fu and Fu factories, and it is difficult for hoarders to eat the disk any higher, only 2 or 3 cars were purchased, and the price was 11 yuan, 3 jiao, 3 fen to 3 jiao, it is said.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Continues to Fall One Yuan and a Half

Although a few hoarders are holding on to good prices in yesterday's market, the batch of sources can be continued, so people's hearts are fluctuating, and some goods households have gradually sold out. Yesterday, Kobe oil fell by one yuan and a half in the market, but only 10 barrels were traded, and the price was 67 yuan and 5 jiao. Dalian oil fell by five jiao, and 120 barrels were traded, and the price was 66 yuan and 8 jiao. Qingqi oil was cut by eight jiao, and 100 pieces were traded, and the price was 48 yuan and 5 jiao. Yanqi oil was less than half a yuan, and 400 pieces were traded, and the price was 49 yuan and 5 jiao. The go-ahead is still only the gardens on this street, and there is no transaction with the inland gang.

### Sugar Market: National Sugar Improves

Yesterday, National Sugar opened 450 bags of Diaozhiqing because the Yong sales were gradually moving, and the price was 34 yuan. Huizhou white also had a good return. The special high-quality goods opened at 58 yuan, Shen Block at 55 yuan, and the second at 51 yuan. Hundreds of bags were traded, and it was heard that the miscellaneous road Qing also had transactions, but the price was not detailed. Foreign sugar also turned good because the foreign exchange shrank slightly. The association allocated the disk, and the spot 24 coarse white rose by one yuan to eight jiao, this stack was 53 yuan, and the foreign stack was 53 yuan and a half to 3 yuan and 8 jiao, and the transshipment goods was 43 yuan, an increase of one yuan. The Taikoo car white rose by half a yuan to one yuan, B was 57 yuan cattle to 58 yuan, and the car red and He red were lack of change. This cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 54 yuan, No. 2 was 53 yuan and a half, No. 3 was 53 yuan, and No. 4 was 52 yuan and a half. This No. 1 ice was 65 yuan, and Pinming was 66 yuan and a half, all up one yuan.

### North and South Goods: Lan Zhuzhi Production Price Steps Up

Lan Zhuzhi (蘭竹枝) is being purchased separately in different producing areas, and the inventory is gradually scarce, so the purchase price is rising day by day. The price increase before and after the lowest price must increase by six-tenths. The goods of the goods customers who transport Shen all want to increase the price, but they know that the sales areas such as Hangzhou are recently selling down due to the emergency situation, so the line is not strong, and they intend to suppress the price, so they have become a standstill situation.

### Seafood: Qilin Vegetable Falls Back

The Long Ya Qilin vegetable was sold for 48 or 9 yuan last week. Because the go-ahead was scattered, the trend was flat. If the recent transactions have fallen back by 2 yuan, it will be 47 yuan. The same disk of Xilan vegetable has gone 3 yuan less than before. The Lion Hair vegetable has been cut off and there has been no continuation.

### Pepper Is Tired

The previous market for White Pepper, such as Wen Island goods, was 160 yuan, and the Dutch goods were 140 yuan. Although it is still called the original disk recently, there is no transaction, and the situation is very sluggish, so black pepper has seen a fallback. The current No. 1 pepper and black big pepper are sold together for 93 yuan, which is 5 yuan less than the previous market.

### Silk and Tea: Unpredictable Silk Prices

Yesterday, the overseas silk market experienced another surge. Yokohama spot prices jumped by 100 yuan, and forward prices rose by 111 yuan, which was quite unexpected. New York Japanese silk rose by 11.1 to 18.8 cents, while Chinese silk increased by 2 to 8 cents. Exchange prices for the near term increased by 15 cents, with trading limited. Forward prices rose by 13.5 cents.

Silk prices are usually at their lowest in April and May, and tend to rise towards the end of the year from October, reaching a peak due to seasonal supply and demand. However, recently, Japanese and American silk prices have often soared. While seasonal factors are a reason, the unrest in the Far East and Europe has inevitably deepened, affecting economic life. Price fluctuations are thus unpredictable, as they follow the tide.

The local silk market in Shanghai was previously quite weak. Yesterday, influenced by the overseas price increases, it became difficult to find a reliable benchmark for silk prices. Consequently, foreign firms and silk merchants adopted a wait-and-see attitude, only tentatively inquiring with each other. No transactions were reported yesterday, either by foreign firms or local merchants.

### Market Summary

Miscellaneous:  There was a slight increase in the arrival of jujubes, and prices also decreased by a small amount of two or three yuan.  Telegrams from Jinan reported an increase of one yuan.  Shanghai merchants sold at prices as low as five or six yuan, with a small number opening sales, even higher than before.

Galangal: Northern merchants are procuring galangal, and the supply of high-quality goods is almost exhausted. The source is running out. Seventy pieces were offered a few days ago, with a transaction price of 55 yuan.

Apricot Kernels: Prices are showing mixed trends, with current market prices remaining at previous levels. Lower-quality kernels are priced at 125 yuan. Deliveries from Haozhou and Guide are expected, suggesting a potential further decline in prices.

Lily Bulbs:  High-quality lily bulb slices are sold out, with mostly lower-quality goods remaining in stock.  It is reported that recently, mid-to-high quality goods sold for over 29 yuan, medium quality for 28 yuan, and other qualities varied.

White Coal:  Sentiment regarding white coal prices has been wavering since the severe drop in Hongji prices.  No transactions have occurred for even one ton.  However, Haifeng white coal has a substantial inventory, but it was released earlier, so the price remains at the original level, with bulk coal at 116 yuan per ton.  Dock handling and brokerage fees are added separately.

New Lead Wire: Yesterday, the market was lively due to procurement from Tianjin, Qingdao, and other northern regions, leading to increasing prices. Currently, No. 8 wire is selling for 80 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Nos. 9, 10, 11, and 14 are all 5 jiao (one-tenth of a yuan) lower than No. 8, while No. 16 is 1 yuan cheaper than the aforementioned varieties. Nos. 17, 18, 19, and 20 are priced at around 75 yuan per dan. From No. 21 to No. 25, the price for bulk goods is around 90 yuan. No. 25 single-strand wire sells for 110 yuan per dan, all showing an increase of 5 to 6 yuan compared to before.

### Surrounded on All Sides - Fierce Battles Near Shanghai Suburbs Yesterday - Residents in Western Shanghai Heard Heavy Artillery Fire - Over a Thousand Chinese Troops Arrived at Baoshan Fort Taiwan - 1,500 Japanese Soldiers Wounded or Killed in Changzhou

According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, residents in western Shanghai heard intermittent and intense artillery fire last night (30th) and this morning (31st). The sound initially came from the Qingpu area, then from the Xujiahui Railway Station. Many people were awakened by the loud noises last night. From 5:30 AM to 10:30 AM this morning, despite the usual urban noise, loud explosions could still be heard, and smoke and explosions were seen from the Xujiahui Station area.

Qingpu Battles Moved to the Suburbs

Xujiahui Station is located on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, which has been cut off by guerrillas more than once in recent weeks. According to brief news received this morning, fierce battles took place last night between Japanese troops and guerrillas west of Hongqiao Airfield along the Qingpu Road. The fighting then shifted toward the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, near the Xujiahui Station. It is believed that the guerrillas had to continue fighting after dawn and retreated toward the railway area in order to make contact with other regular troops. The anti-Japanese army continues its attacks.

Japanese Troops Heavily Deployed Around Longhua

According to Chinese news from the Nanshi area, Japanese troops were deployed around Longhua Road in the Nanshi area yesterday afternoon. Japanese troops were also seen moving around, with several trucks carrying small cannons heading southwest of Shanghai. A large number of light and heavy machine guns were also transported to the area.

Fierce Battles Occur Frequently Around Shanghai-Hangzhou

A spokesman for the Japanese Army in Shanghai stated today that the Japanese garrison in Jiaxing has been conducting operations to expel guerrillas in a vast area near the city since October 15th. Between Xitang and Taozhuang, 30 kilometers northeast of Jiaxing, they clashed with the 8th Regiment of the newly formed 30th Division of the Chinese army, resulting in 4 Japanese soldiers killed and 9 wounded. On October 15th, Japanese troops clashed with guerrillas twice, 10 kilometers southeast of Fengjing on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, resulting in casualties on both sides.

Chinese Regular Troops Open Fire on Taiwan Fort

According to visitors from Baoshan, the city of Baoshan used to have a garrison of over 100 Japanese soldiers, but they have all been transferred recently due to the pressing situations in the Xiangbei (northern Hunan) and Jinxi (western Shanxi) battlefields. Only a dozen or so Japanese soldiers remain, along with Japanese advisor Nakajima and several special agents. In addition, there are over 20 puppet police officers and local ruffians forming a puppet "county government" that extorts and harasses the local population. Recently, the puppet "county government" planned to force the heads of each neighborhood to report household information and draft young men to sacrifice for the Japanese side. Upon hearing this, the residents of the city panicked and fled, and the local heads of neighborhoods also moved elsewhere to seek temporary refuge. Currently, the puppet "government's" power only extends to the city itself. One or two miles outside the city, the area is under the control of guerrillas. Furthermore, over 5,000 fully equipped Chinese armed troops recently arrived at Fort Taiwan southeast of Baoshan City and are constructing fortifications there. Local residents are willing to serve and are paid accordingly. It is reported that the Chinese army will contact the guerrillas in the surrounding areas and launch a general attack on the county seat as soon as the opportunity arises.

Heavy Casualties for Japanese Troops in Changzhou

According to people from Changzhou who fled to Shanghai, in order to support the Xiangbei battlefield and contain Japanese forces, the Chinese high command dispatched about 30,000 men from the 63rd Division and other units to the southwest of Changzhou. They advanced northward in several routes from the base areas around Yixing Zhangzhu, Fan Liyang, and attacked Japanese strongholds and the railway line. Upon receiving orders, the regular troops were fully equipped.

Hai Customs Wharfs for Passenger Embarkation and Disembarkation Managed by Water Police - Taking Over Piers 9, 10, and 11 From Today - Shanghai Municipal Police Retains Authority Over These Three Piers

The Shanghai Times reports that the Water Police will take over the management of Piers 9, 10, and 11, and the areas in front of these piers, from November 1st. The earlier report that the Shanghai Municipal Police would cede full management authority of the Bund to the Water Police is inaccurate. The Water Police used to handle the police affairs of the customs wharfs together with the Police Department. According to the new system, the Water Police will manage the customs wharfs and piers along the Bund where passengers embark and disembark, and provide better policing. The Water Police will also manage ships arriving at or leaving the piers, and other matters previously handled by the Shanghai Municipal Police within the Jianghai Customs. However, the Shanghai Municipal Police will retain management authority over these three piers and the Water Police will assist in the management.

### Extended Period for Soliciting Funds for Winter Clothing - Shanghai Offers Double the Amount - Original Target of 200,000 Yuan Already Reached - Period Extended by One Month to Maximize Donations

The solicitation of 200,000 yuan in funds for winter clothing in Shanghai has been underway since last month. The industrial, commercial, and cultural sectors have enthusiastically participated. In just two months, the target amount has been reached. The original deadline was today and tomorrow. Now, because the soldiers on the front lines are fighting hard and the refugees in the war zones are displaced and suffering, the funds for winter clothing should be collected in large quantities to meet the needs. Therefore, it has been decided to extend the solicitation period to November 3rd to maximize donations. At that time, in accordance with the national solicitation regulations, double the amount of 200,000 yuan will be presented to express the support and concern of all sectors of Shanghai for the soldiers and refugees.

Advancing Rapidly Northward

One unit encountered Japanese troops in Xiasi Town, west of Ge Lake in Changzhou, on October 25th and engaged in fierce battles. After several charges by the Chinese army, most of the 200 Japanese troops stationed in the town were wiped out. The remaining Japanese troops sent urgent telegrams to the city for reinforcements. However, the number of Japanese troops stationed in Changzhou was small, and the Chinese army's offensive was sudden and fierce. The "Changzhou Garrison Headquarters" telegraphed the Japanese military authorities in central China for help. Five thousand Japanese troops were dispatched from Xuzhou and Suzhou

To Rush to the Rescue

They advanced along the Wuli Road and Wuyi Road toward Xiasi, and dispatched five or sixty speedboats to attack towns along Ge Lake such as Dong'an and Houyu. Japanese planes also flew in from time to time to bomb. The Japanese troops besieged in Xiasi Town took the opportunity to break out of the encirclement and flee north. The Chinese army has now crossed Xiasi and is

Fiercely Attacking Northward

Dong'an Town had previously been invaded by Japanese troops landing there, but after a fierce counter-attack by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops, suffering too many casualties, boarded boats and fled. Since the outbreak of this battle, the scale and scope of the Chinese army's advance have been greater than in the past, causing great panic among the Japanese troops. For a week, Japanese military transport has been frequent on the railways and highways, and the conscription of laborers in the city has been intense. More than 400 city residents have been conscripted, and 200 to 300 people have been brought in from Suzhou and other places. As a result, the general public is also very panicked. Men from the middle and lower classes have almost disappeared from the city streets. All

Conscripted Laborers

Are forced to wear Japanese military uniforms and transport grain and ammunition for the Japanese army. Some are even sent to the front lines as vanguards. After a week of fierce fighting, the Japanese suffered about 1,500 casualties, and most of the Chinese laborers also died tragically. The Japanese army has been using trucks and boats to transport the bodies to the city for cremation in the public sports field. The so-called "Peace Alliance Army" transferred from Shanghai has also suffered heavy casualties. After this major blow, the Japanese army has been maintaining strict security in the suburbs and along the railway line. At night, anyone seen is shot at randomly, resulting in the unjust deaths of several innocent villagers every day.

Transferring Puppet Troops to the Front Lines

The Japanese troops stationed along the two roads are originally very thinly deployed. Recently, the Chinese guerrillas have been attacking the traffic on the two roads, and the Japanese army has been almost unable to cope. It is learned that the Japanese army has recently ordered the transfer of more than 1,000 puppet troops, newly recruited in the suburbs of Shanghai, to Changzhou, Hangzhou, and other places, and has changed their Japanese military uniforms in order to create a false show of strength.

Japanese and Puppet Troops Patrol in Teams at Night

The Japanese Military Police and the Puppet Police Brigade in western Shanghai, fearing that they will be annihilated by the Chinese army because of the large number of Chinese regular troops that have arrived in the suburbs of Shanghai and the growing strength of their forces, have taken special precautions since the night before last in order to prolong their lives. They have been divided into several small teams, fully equipped and deployed, patrolling the streets. Their actions are mysterious and their gatherings and dispersals are inconsistent, causing a small panic. The situation is becoming increasingly tense. Ghoulish Road is under curfew and pedestrians are prohibited. There are plainclothes teams or puppet police posts at the entrances of each alley, holding rifles and pretending to be stern.

Japanese Troops in Nanshi are Panicked

Recently, the guerrillas have been active in the border areas of Nanshi and the Shanghai-Minhang Road and Kunyun Shanghai West sections of Shanghai County, which have completely entered the heart of the Japanese-controlled area. They openly inspect traitors and restrict the entry of food into the Japanese-controlled area. The Japanese army does not dare to go deep beyond the highway line. In addition, most of the garrisoned troops have been transferred out and are insufficient. The newly replenished young soldiers have not experienced the battlefield and are childish and timid, and dare not attack. Therefore, the troops have retreated to the Gaochang Temple Longhua Road area. However, twice a day, they move out small cannons, machine guns, and large numbers of troops, and fire them on Longhua Road in a target-shooting style, which has been going on for almost a week. But at 5:00 PM, they all concentrate in the headquarters of the Gaochang Temple Arsenal and do not cross the line.

Shanghai Western District Negotiations - The Shanghai Municipal Council's Proposal to be Submitted to Board for Discussion

The Continental Daily reports that, according to well-informed sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council will submit the proposal to "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an to resolve the disputes in the four districts. It is now in the hands of the directors and will be carefully considered at the board meeting to be held tomorrow (1st), and then submitted to the puppet "municipal government." It is expected that representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Council and Fu Xiao'an will not meet to discuss this proposal until next week.

The New Voice Society reports that regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposed "construction plan" to resolve the issue of road construction beyond the Shanghai Western District, according to Japanese newspapers, it was submitted by Chief Inspector Fessenden to Fu Xiao'an on the evening of October 26th. However, according to Western newspapers close to the British side, the "proposal" has not yet been submitted to the Jiangwan "Municipal Government." Furthermore, according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's intelligence department, the "proposal" is now in the hands of the consular body and will be reviewed and considered by the consular body before being submitted to the "Mayor" of Jiangwan after a lengthy discussion at the board meeting to be held this afternoon. All rumors are speculative. Because the "Great Way Municipal Government" insists on taking over the management rights of the road construction area beyond the boundary, the views of both sides are too far apart, and there are many hidden reefs in future negotiations. It is said that the "Municipal Government" has formed a "special task force" to carry out its so-called maintenance of security and order for residents outside the boundaries of Shanghai Western District.

The October Settlement Period - Industries Successfully Navigate - The Four Banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank of China) Manage Discounted Loans to the Best of Their Ability

Yesterday was the October settlement period for Shanghai's industry and commerce, the only general settlement period for long-term credit loans. According to the results of negotiations between the borrowers and the 41 money houses regarding the long-term credit loans of 10 million yuan that expired yesterday, 7 to 8 million yuan were extended to the end of April next year or re-contracted to extend for one to six months, and 2 to 3 million yuan were repaid in full. Regarding new credit loans, it is reported that 2 to 3 million yuan were transacted, mostly for factories and businesses in the domestic goods industry. The Discount and Mortgage Committee of the Four Banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank of China) handled discounted and mortgaged loans until the end of October. It is reported that there is still a loan balance of more than 16 million yuan, and extensions are granted for loans that expire at the end of October. As for the financial market, it remains as stable as ever, and there have been no changes in various interest rates. The money market for foreign exchange yesterday decreased by 1.17 cents.

### A Word for the Industrial and Commercial Circles - (One)

— Sanjie

Shanghai is one of the world's great commercial ports. The industrial and commercial businesses are changing with each passing day. Therefore, entrepreneurs and employees all use their intelligence and scheme against each other. Their spirit of striving and perseverance is truly worthy of admiration. However, business is limitless, but energy is limited. Isn't it harmful to one's health to constantly exert one's wisdom and worry? Yet these great figures, the greater their careers, the healthier their minds. They are all human beings, so how can they be so different? The reason is that they rely on tonics.

However, there are many types of tonics, and it is not easy to choose. If you buy substandard products, it will not only not benefit your body but also waste your money, which is a pity. I am not afraid of wordiness and would like to offer you a target for purchasing.

According to the Zhengwei Pharmacy (main store opposite the Great Stage on Second Ma Road) (branch store at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road), the "Wei Ling Malt Essence Cod Liver Oil" that they distribute has the effect of strengthening the body and brain. "Wei Ling Pure Cod Liver Oil" has the effect of nourishing the lungs and replenishing deficiency. "Seahorse Essence", a new blood tonic specifically for treating anemia and blood loss, has been distributed for a long time and is popular throughout the country. They have the reputation of being the "Three Heroes of Tonics." The reason is that the manufacturing factors of the above three tonics are first based on ethical principles, so regarding the formulation of ingredients, the purity of extraction, and the strictness of supervision, they are all based on academic theory and carefully select the most noble raw materials. Therefore, the tonic power is particularly strong and the effect is particularly great. The breadth of sales is setting new records every year. It is hoped that all sectors of industry and commerce will actively purchase them to achieve the effect of strengthening the body and assisting the Mengjin of their careers. In order to reward the kindness of new and old customers, Zhengwei Pharmacy will give away a baby towel or a dozen practice books for every two bottles purchased. The deadline is ten days, and there are not many days left, so don't miss it. For phone purchases, call 92525. The more you buy, the more you get.

Puppet Police Guard Panama Merchant Ship - Chinese Crew Members Detained - The Polly Dai, a Panama Ship, Has Been Moved to Yangshupu - The American Consul Will Protest in his Capacity as a Representative

The Polly Dai (transliteration), a Panama ship managed by the Norwegian firm Wah Loon Yoko, loaded with coal, arrived in Shanghai on the 26th of last month and docked at the Japanese Mitsui Wharf in Pudong to unload. On the morning of the day before yesterday (30th), a team of puppet police officers, accompanied by one Japanese and one Korean each, boarded the ship and arrested two Chinese crew members, detaining them at the Pudong puppet police station. It is learned that the two arrested men are originally from Hong Kong, and the reason for their arrest is falsely accused of anti-Japanese activities. A team of puppet police officers remained on the ship, intending to arrest a Chinese first mate when he returned to the ship. But as of this morning, there has been no confirmation as to whether the first mate has been arrested or whether the puppet police have withdrawn. However, the ship was moved to the Hey Fung Cotton Mill Wharf in Yangshupu in the morning. The shipowner reported the arrest of the two Chinese to the American Consulate in Shanghai, and the American consul is now considering filing a protest in his capacity as the representative of the Panamanian government in Shanghai.

### Mitsui Agrees to Return Eggs Seized from American Merchants - Recently Seized Eggs Should Be Returned to Original Owners - Past Seizures Valued at 300,000 Yuan

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that, after the Mitsui company's seizure of eggs was exposed in the newspapers, the Mitsui company notified a certain American egg canning merchant this morning (31st) that the two batches of eggs seized from their company, totaling over 100 baskets, which are currently in the Mitsui company's warehouse on Huangpu Road, will be returned. However, the company must present the correct waybill and an appropriate guarantee. Based on other signs, the eggs purchased by British and American companies in the Yangtze River estuary, which have just been transported or will arrive in Shanghai within a day or two, should be delivered to the

Legitimate Original Owners

It is estimated that the eggs seized by Mitsui in recent weeks from seven British and American companies exceed 300,000 yuan. If Mitsui stops its egg seizure activities now, the factories of the seven companies that have been closed can resume operations immediately. These companies are now demanding that the eggs be returned to them in kind rather than receiving

Monetary Compensation

Of the 200 or so baskets of eggs that Mitsui has agreed to return to a certain American company, 20 baskets were seized last Saturday. As of this afternoon, there has been no news that they have been returned to the original owners, but it is expected that they will be returned today. The vast majority of eggs seized by Mitsui since October 10th have been

Broken and Sold

Therefore, British and American companies have no way to recover most of their lost eggs. At the same time, due to Mitsui's monopoly on the egg supply in the Yangtze River estuary, there is a shortage of eggs in the Shanghai public market. The few eggs that can be purchased are transported from Pudong and

Shanghai Suburbs

It is also learned that Mitsui does not use duck eggs for canning, so they are sold to small merchants for sale in the market. Although foreigners do not like duck eggs, the Chinese like to eat them.

### Commemorating the Death Anniversary of Mr. Huang Xing - Unyielding in Founding the Republic - His Hard Struggle is Worthy of Emulation

Yesterday was the anniversary of the death of the martyr Huang Xing. All sectors of the city paid tribute to Huang Xing's great achievements in opposing imperial rule and founding the Republic, and especially his spirit of fearlessness in the face of danger, unyielding spirit, and hard struggle, which is worthy of emulation. However, no ceremonies were held. In addition, the central government stipulates that the death anniversaries of Deng Zhongyuan, Hu Zhantang, Chen Yingshi, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and Huang Xing will all be commemorated on the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day on March 29 next year.

From Shanghai to the Interior - Route to Ningbo - Both Cost and Time are Extremely Economical

Recently, travelers heading to the interior mostly take the route through Haiphong, but the procedures for obtaining a passport are complicated, foreign exchange rates are high, and boat ticket prices have increased, making it even more difficult financially. Therefore, some also take the route through Guangzhou Bay and transfer to Yulin, but there are too many transfers and transportation is also inconvenient. According to inquiries, the following route from Shanghai

Is Economical in Terms of Time

Seems to be more economical (1) Take a sea ship from Shanghai to Zhenhai, which takes about 10 hours. (2) Take a small wheel from Zhenhai Port, pass through the blockade line, enter the Yong River, and reach Ningbo. The boat takes 3 hours. (3) Take a small wheel from Ningbo to Sanjiangkou (parked in the heart of the river) for about 2 hours, and wait for the barge to

Disembark on the Riverbank

It takes two and a half hours. (4) Take a sedan or rickshaw from Jiangkou to Xikou (sedan is more comfortable) for 3 hours. (5) Take a public bus from Xikou to Jinhua, which takes about 9 hours. Baggage is free for 20 kg. (6) After arriving in Jinhua, take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway westward to Dongxiang Station in Jiangxi Province.

You Can Enter Hunan by Land Route

Also (7) After arriving in Jinhua, you can take a train to Lanxi and travel west along the highway to reach She County in Anhui, where transportation will become more convenient. The cost for the above (1) to (5) segments is only about 30 yuan (calculated according to the official cabin). The time is only about 30 hours.

### Someone is Distributing Propaganda in Nanjing Road

At around 2:00 PM yesterday, someone suddenly scattered a large number of five-colored propaganda items from the roof of the Dashing Company on Nanjing Road, Yu Qiaqing Road, with words such as "Anti-Japanese Youth League."

### Pastor Decker Detained in Japan - His Wife Quietly Arrives in Shanghai - It is Said That Her Husband is Still in the Hands of the Japanese

Pastor Decker, a representative of the World Christian Student Federation, was detained by the Kyoto Police Department while traveling to Kobe, Japan. Pastor Decker went to Japan from the United States on June 15th. When he was about to leave on October 10th, he was detained by the Kyoto Police. His wife did not suffer the same fate and quietly left Japan for Shanghai with her two children on the 29th of last month. According to Mrs. Decker, she still cannot say for sure whether her husband has been released or is still in the hands of the Japanese. It is said that the reason for Pastor Decker's arrest is that he distributed documents that disturbed peace and order and spread unfounded rumors in Kyoto.

### Establishing Grain Storage May Be Possible - Expected in Half a Month - Hoping for Assistance from the Financial Sector

The joint ordering of foreign rice by organizations in this city was completed yesterday. Regarding the proposal to establish grain storage, the rice industry also hopes that the authorities will adopt it. However, late rice is still being harvested in various places and will be completely harvested by the end of the tenth month of the lunar calendar. At that time, the source of rice and grain will inevitably increase. Although the authorities are considering it, it is expected that it may be implemented in half a month and that the financial sector will provide assistance to facilitate turnover.

### National Defense and Gold Public Bonds - Repayment of Principal and Payment of Interest Yesterday - Funds Appropriated Specifically by the Ministry - Full Payment by the Central Bank, Etc.

National Defense Public Bonds and Gold Public Bonds of the Republic of China in 1938: (1) National Defense Public Bonds of 500 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, issued on May 1, 1938; (2) Gold Public Bonds, with an annual interest rate of 5%, issued on May 1, 1938, divided into customs gold notes of 100 million customs gold, English gold notes of 10 million pounds, and US gold notes of 50 million yuan. Both of the above two types of public bonds were scheduled to repay the principal and pay interest for the first time on October 31 of this year. They have been appropriated by the Ministry of Finance from designated tax revenue guarantees and handed over to the Central Bank, which has been credited to the accounts of the National Debt Fund Management Committee for the two public bonds. The Central Bank and its entrusted banks have been fully repaying the principal and paying interest since yesterday. It is learned that although the above public bonds have been solicited by the Ministry of Finance to various agencies, organizations, and overseas Chinese, the subscriptions have been very enthusiastic. However, due to the special circumstances in Shanghai and the lack of formal solicitation agencies, there are no paying banks in Shanghai for this first repayment of principal and payment of interest.

### North Jiangxi Road: Japanese Troops Increase Posts, Inspection More Stringent Than Ever Before

Recently, Japanese troop defenses in the North Jiangxi Road area have become stricter. In addition to dispatching armed Japanese soldiers for constant patrols, they are also conducting thorough inspections at the gaps leading to special zones. Any slight non-compliance results in detention, and pedestrians view passing through this area with dread. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the number of Japanese soldiers at the Wenshi Road gap increased from two to three, and the strictness of the inspection was unprecedented. The area blocked by the Japanese with barbed wire has become extremely inconvenient to enter and exit because the traffic has been cut off by the barbed wire fence, so the business district is becoming increasingly desolate, and many residents are also moving away. According to investigations, there were originally 89 shops in this section, and 33 have now closed.

### British Navy in Shanghai Purchases Two Merchant Ships: Shanghai Tug & Lighter Co.'s "Saney" and Moller & Co.'s "Caroline Moller"

The British Navy in Shanghai has purchased two steamships. The "Saney," owned by the Shanghai Tug & Lighter Co., was recently purchased by the British Naval Department in Shanghai for £20,000, equivalent to one million Chinese dollars. The transaction has already been completed. This ship was originally a rescue vessel, so its steel hull is very strong. It will soon sail to Hong Kong. Also, Moller & Co.'s "Caroline Moller" is being purchased by the British Navy, and negotiations are currently underway. This ship was originally owned by the British Navy. Two years ago, Moller & Co. purchased it in Singapore, and now the British Navy is buying it back.

### The New Economic Atmosphere of "Free China" (Continued): By Bai Min, Translated from the "Millard's Review"

The recent improvements in agriculture in the provinces of "Free China" have also shown good results. In most areas, government banks have provided credit loans to newly established rural cooperatives, or have implemented systematic seed improvements, which have greatly increased harvests. In the vast areas of Yunnan, grains have been planted to replace opium poppies. The province's opium production is the lowest this year in decades. The harvests of cotton, soybeans, tea, and sugarcane in "Free China" have all increased. Although farmers' vehicles are strictly prohibited from using the new highways, the new trucking business has opened up new markets and sources of supply for tens of thousands of villages that were isolated from the outside world just a year ago.

Of course, the arduous task of economic development in "Free China" still requires future efforts, but the great achievements of the past twelve months have undoubtedly enabled every village, city, and province in "Free China" to now have a new economic life and to move forward rapidly. Only a small portion of the areas in "Free China" have benefited from the new economic development so far. The economic activities of the people in most areas of the provinces have not yet been touched by the atmosphere of the new era, and life continues as it did in the past. Many villages remain unchanged, and hundreds of miles of new highways meander through undeveloped rural areas. The conservative residents of many county towns still stare blankly at the new full-range transportation between the provincial centers, and do not resolve to live according to the needs of the new situation and new circumstances.

However, the new economic development of "Free China" is a fact. Its progress has far exceeded the stage of a year ago, and it is no longer limited to the plans on paper formulated by the central government offices. This plan has been implemented in countless places, and is still spreading rapidly, gradually overcoming the resistance of past economic conservatism.

### High-Ranking Official of the Puppet "Salt Bureau" Ambushed with Huge Sum of Money: Car Intercepted on Avenue Road, Driver Killed, Feng Gongzhan Also in Danger; 100,000 Yuan in Banknotes Escape in Car

Around 2:45 PM yesterday, another shocking shooting blood case occurred in the Public Concession, resulting in one death and one serious injury. Here is what the news agency reporter learned about the situation:

Car Blocked, Driver Injured

Yesterday afternoon at 3:15, two men in Chinese attire were riding in a black taxi, traveling from west to east, when they were passing the intersection of Avenue Road and Datong Road in the Public Concession, several men in short clothes suddenly jumped out from where they were ambushing, each reaching out to grab, shouting for the driver to stop, and ordering the people in the car to get out. At that time, the two men in the car thought they were police officers searching, so they got out of the car one after another to wait for the search. Unexpectedly, after the two men and the driver got out of the car, the men in short clothes next to them suddenly took out guns and shot the driver first, causing the driver to be hit by two bullets, one in the abdomen and one in the leg, falling down in front of No. 607 Avenue Road.

One Passenger Shot in the Chest

The two passengers who had gotten out of the car, standing next to the car, were greatly shocked when they saw this. One passenger immediately fled, while the other was about to shout when he was shot several times, immediately being hit by a bullet in the chest, injured and falling to the ground, in front of the doorway of No. 610 on the same road. The shooters, seeing that their goal had been achieved, jumped into the car with their accomplices and drove off on their own, speeding towards Carter Road, and disappeared in an instant. At that time, because pedestrians suddenly heard gunshots, they hid themselves, so no one noticed the license plate number of the car.

Driver Dies, Passenger Also in Danger

At that time, the nearby police officers also heard the alarm and arrived. Seeing the situation, they reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene, and sent the dying driver and the passenger who was shot in the chest to the Shanghai Pass Road Public Works Bureau Hospital. However, the driver died soon after because of the injuries to vital parts of the body and excessive bleeding. The injured passenger is still being treated in the hospital, but it is said that his life is in extreme danger.

Injured Passenger Named Feng Gongzhan

After this bloody case occurred, the Public Concession Police immediately began investigating. It is learned that the passenger who was shot and seriously injured is named Feng Gongzhan, from Cixi, 36 years old, and is a high-ranking official of the puppet "Salt Bureau" in Zhejiang. The deceased was Jin Qichang, the driver of Wang Ruikai, the puppet "Governor of Zhejiang Province." This time, they had just come to Shanghai from Zhejiang a few days ago. Yesterday, Feng said that his friend Wu, who fled when the shooting occurred, is currently a senior official in the puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Government Office," and planned to return to Hangzhou in the original car. The car's direction on Avenue Road from west to east was towards the North Railway Station.

Huge Sum of 100,000 Yuan Gone with the Car

When Feng and others planned to return to Zhejiang by car, they had a small leather suitcase with them, containing 100,000 yuan in cash. When they went out, the suitcase was in the car. Whether the men in short clothes were lying in ambush to rob the huge sum of money is currently under strict investigation by the police. However, as of the time of publication, there has been no news of the car being found.

### Intercepted Passerby, Firearms Found

Liu Shaokui, Chief Chinese Detective of the Public Concession Police, and Detective Yang Xiguang, learned yesterday that bandits would pass by the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road, so they waited there and successfully apprehended Gu Youchun, a man from Haimen, and took him to the police station. After questioning, he confessed that there were firearms hidden at No. 39, Lane 80, Gaoun Road in the French Concession, so they went to search and confiscate them. They confiscated one handgun, nine bullets, one lotus pistol, twenty-eight bullets, and eighty-nine Mauser rifle bullets. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted them temporarily according to the Public Danger Law and requested permission to change the date because further detailed investigation was still needed. Gu Youchun confessed that these firearms were picked up by the river in Nanxiang. Although he tried to sell them, he never actually did it. After Judge Xiao Biancai verified the confession, he ordered the postponement and rescheduling of the hearing for one week.

### French Lawyer Dahan Sues for Legal Fees: One-Sided Debate Concluded, Four Defendants Do Not Acknowledge, Re-Hearing Requested to Revoke Original Verdict

Five lumber firms in the Nanshi area, Yikang, Zhenchang, Changyuan, Kaitai, and others, successively moved to the Baisezhong Road and Zhao Bishop Road area in the western district of the French Concession, renting vacant land to pile up timber and use as business premises. Around the spring and summer of last year, the French Public Works Bureau sent a letter to each lumber firm stating that the vacant land could only be used for building houses and not for stacking wood, and that they would be required to move out after a certain period. Therefore, the managers or owners of each lumber firm jointly engaged French lawyer Dahan to represent them in writing to the French Public Works Bureau, requesting exemption from moving. A contract was immediately signed. Later, lawyer Dahan sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau requesting a result. Due to the limitations of the regulations, the request was not approved, and each firm had to move out. Subsequently, lawyer Dahan urged the client lumber firms to pay the legal fees. Each of the five lumber firms paid 60 yuan, totaling 300 yuan, to Dahan, obtained receipts, and retrieved the contracts. Each firm thought the matter was over. Unexpectedly, lawyer Dahan believed that the legal fees at that time should have been 300 yuan per firm, but only 60 yuan per firm had been collected, leaving a total of 1,200 yuan. He sent letters to each lumber firm to urge payment, but to no avail. Lawyer Dahan then submitted a complaint to the Civil Court of the Special No. 2 Court, requesting public service for the lumber firms that could not be found. The court, according to the complaint, carried out the public service in accordance with the law. As a result, none of the five lumber firms appeared in court, and it was ruled that each of the lumber firms should pay the legal fees in full. The case went through a final judgement before being transferred for execution. Each lumber firm then learned that they were being sued for legal fees. Therefore, Zhang Yongde of Yikang Lumber Firm, Ma Chunrong of Zhenchang Lumber Firm, Zhang Chunbao of Changyuan Lumber Firm, and Zhang Shiyi of Kaitai Lumber Firm, entrusted lawyer Wu Leping and others to act as agents and submitted evidence and reasons, filing a complaint with the Civil Court of the Special No. 2 Court against lawyer Dahan.

Based on the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Li Liang, held a hearing in the seventh courtroom yesterday morning. Both parties were represented by lawyers. According to the lawyer representing the plaintiff in the retrial, each of the retrial plaintiffs had addresses and could be found in the telephone directory, so they could not be said to be untraceable. Moreover, the legal fees were originally set at 300 yuan, which had been paid in full. The retrieved contracts and receipts were presented to the court, requesting the original verdict to be revoked and an appropriate verdict to be made. The defendant, represented by lawyer Zhou Liangfu, submitted the location written by the client at the time and the return receipt of the reminder letter as evidence, and stated that the legal fees were agreed upon as 300 yuan per firm at that time. The number of legal fees was not specified in the contract, resulting in the receipt clearly stating that 300 yuan was received. It should be requested that the retrial appeal be rejected. After reviewing the above statements, it was announced that the debate was over, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on November 4.

### Impersonating the Military to Intimidate a Doctor: Two Criminals Apprehended Pending Investigation

Lin Yuxiao, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, used to live in Nanshi. After the war, he took refuge at No. 12 Pingwang Street in the concession, and still practiced medicine to make a living. On July 15 of this year, Lin suddenly received a letter, falsely claiming to be Chen Yi, the commander of the Sixth Detachment of the Fifth Column of the Jiangzhe Border Guerrilla Force. The letter was in the form of an official letter, complete with seals. The letter also included a bullet, and the words in the letter roughly stated that the unit lacked military pay, and appealed to the spirit of the people to contribute money or effort, and asked for appropriate assistance. Lin ignored it. He was then asked to meet at the Xiang Sheng Gambling Hall in Caojiadu. Lin did not go as agreed. Until 11:00 AM on the 28th of the month, Fu Fuchu, a 66-year-old man from Hangzhou, suddenly held a letter to Lin Yuqing, and after Lin asked, it turned out to be a third letter of intimidation. At that time, he also said that no matter what, a considerable amount of money must be paid, otherwise he would never give up. Lin then pretended to be cooperative and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station by telephone. Detective Xue Youwen and Detective Sun Dafa rushed to the scene, arrested the suspect, and took him to the police station. After interrogation, he confessed that the delivery of the letter this time was entrusted by Wang Guoying from Hangzhou. The detectives then went to the Fu Long Tea House at No. 218 Zhejiang Road and arrested Wang, bringing him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, stating that the case still needed to be investigated and the notes needed to be verified, so he requested that the two defendants be temporarily detained pending investigation before prosecution. After Judge Feng Shide questioned the two defendants briefly, he ordered them to be returned to custody and the hearing rescheduled.

### Public Concession Police Department Commends Meritorious Chinese Police Officers

Because several Chinese detectives of the Public Concession Police Department have made meritorious contributions in bravely arresting thieves and assassins this year, it was specifically decided to award them First and Second Class Police Bravery Medals at the annual routine inspection ceremony held at the Mixed Racecourse on the 5th of this month to show encouragement. A total of 17 people received the Second Class Medal, including Tang Lirui (No. 192), Jin Zixiang (No. 1300), Zhu Xiangzhen (No. 1087), Yan Xiangchen (No. 2723), Chen Hongshan (No. 2986), Guo Shouxin (No. 63), Wang Chungui (No. 100), Zhang Zhensheng (No. 2399), Guo Peixin (No. 711), Kong Qingzhang (No. 3369), Jin Jiamo (No. 2512), He Yuling (No. 1819), Qi Zhanwu (No. 174), Shao Zelin (No. 2724), and Xia Shiyong (No. 3357). Also, Western Deputy Detective Clayton and Western Probationary Head Detective Bakston. A total of two people received the First Class Medal, including Liu Zhaolong (No. 3398) and Zhao Yulan (No. 730).

### Social Miscellany

Thieves Apprehended, Confess to Intimidation

Chen Xiangming, the manager of the Daming Match Factory office at No. 15, Lane 771, Niuzhuang Road, received a threatening letter by post on the 6th of this month, bearing the name Wang Ying, the leader of the Soviet-Zhejiang Border Guerrilla, demanding 3,000 yuan. As a result of negotiations, the matter was settled for 120 yuan. Unexpectedly, at 8:00 AM on the 13th, four thieves, armed with handguns, went to the office, robbed 1,800 yuan worth of money and goods, and fled with a shout. Until about 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, Xu Decheng, a Chinese detective from the Yideng Road Police Station, apprehended Shen Genxiang, a suspect from Longhua, and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court. When questioned, the defendant confessed to writing a threatening letter to demand money, but said he had nothing to do with the robbery of the Daming Match Factory on Niuzhuang Road, and asked for mercy. Judge Huang Risheng ordered that he still be detained and the hearing rescheduled.

Boatman Drunk, Pushes Wife into River

Lu Heshang, a boatman from Suzhou, was mooring his boat No. 3437 at the Zhaopu Road Bridge in Suzhou Creek. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Lu Heshang drank too much alcohol, resulting in being very drunk. He was pushed into the river by his wife, Lu Xiaomei. Fortunately, Lu Xiaomei was rescued and spared from disaster, while Lu was arrested and sent to the Special No. 1 Court for prosecution. According to Lu Heshang, he was really drunk at the time and inadvertently pushed his wife into the river, and did not intend to harm his wife. Lu Xiaomei also defended her husband, saying that her husband did not intentionally push her into the river and expressed her unwillingness to pursue the matter. As a result of the court hearing, Lu Heshang was found not guilty.

Quadrangle Love Affair, Murderer's Trial Concluded

At 5:30 PM on the 23rd of this month, a case of a quadrangle love affair occurred on Yulin Road, where a concubine killed Yangzhou woman Wang Xiuying. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen sat in the Second Criminal Court to continue the trial. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted Du Defa and Liu Linfu for the crime of joint murder under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and stated the details of the case, saying that the purchase of the bayonet and the discussion at the Fuyuan Tea House were both witnessed by the two defendants, which had been investigated and confirmed by the detectives. Then the landlady of the two-story building, Mrs. Kong Xu, complained that when she heard it and went upstairs to check, the defendant Du Defa closed the door and refused to let her in. Du Defa still denied the murder, while Liu Linfu confessed that he committed the murder at Du's request and admitted to the murder without hesitation, and hired lawyer Huang Huancheng to defend him. The court ordered the two defendants to be detained pending sentencing next Tuesday morning.

Corpse Found in Chen's House in Pudong

After the Japanese military police team moved out of the huge Chen's house in Yangjiazhai, Pudong, the charitable organization continued to dig up five corpses from the underground behind the house. In the past two days, four bodies of modern girls and one body wearing a leather coat resembling a military officer were found. Most of them were separated from their heads and bodies. All the bodies have now been buried in the cemetery near Mugou Bridge.

### Pay Attention to Kidnapping of Children

Recently, incidents of kidnapping children in Shanghai have been seen repeatedly. Most of the kidnappers use candy and other methods to lure children. Yesterday, a six-year-old girl, nicknamed Huanzhong, was kidnapped by thieves from No. 58, Lane 318, Tiantong Road, Hongkou. Her family found out and searched everywhere, but could not find her. It is reported that these kidnappers sell children overseas. Parents should pay close attention to their children's outings.

### New Life Women's Handicraft Society Exhibition and Sale
A New Dream

Starting from the 3rd, a four-day exhibition and sale will be held at the society's location. Major companies and manufacturers are cooperating to provide convenience.

The Chinese Christian Women's Temperance Association is an international women's organization with considerable achievements in various women's affairs. Before the war, Liu Wang Liming, currently in the women's circle, was the backbone of the association. After the war, the association's location was moved from Yue Ming Yuan Road to No. 80 Xieqiao Lane on Jing'an Temple Road. Due to the assassination of Dr. Liu Zhan'en, Liu Wang Liming went to Hong Kong. However, the Women's Temperance Association did not slacken in its work in various departments; on the contrary, it is actively promoting them.

Currently, in addition to running the New Life Women's Senior Vocational School, middle school, and supplementary classes, the Women's Temperance Association is particularly eager to point out the New Life Women's Handicraft Society. This handicraft society was specifically established for women who fled from the war. Although it has not been around for long, its achievements are already quite good. The main goal is to train refugee women so that they have a skill in handicrafts, allowing them to be self-sufficient and not rely on long-term relief. In a very short period, hundreds of refugee women have received training from the society and have gained a skill, currently making a living through handicrafts. Benefiting refugees is indeed no small feat!

This war has caused female compatriots to be displaced. It is unknown how many are finding it difficult to find work in the "isolated island" and are living in hardship. Therefore, it is imperative that the Women's Temperance Association, in collaboration with the business community, establish the New Life Women's Handicraft Class to provide work for refugee women so they can live. This is also something that women's organizations wish to hold. Recently, it was decided to hold a four-day product exhibition and sale at No. 80 Xieqiao Lane on November 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th, with the aim of arousing sympathy and attention from people in society so that they can enthusiastically purchase the society's products and prevent problems in the lives of hundreds of refugee women.

I remember that the New Life Women's Handicraft Society also held an exhibition and sale last year. Not long ago, when the retail department of the Refugee Production and Consumption Cooperative opened at No. 850 Lafayette Road, the New Life Women's Handicraft Society also participated with its products. Generally speaking, the society's products are not only comparable to those made by factories, but also cheaper than ordinary companies and businesses.

This time, most of the products on display are handmade crafts by refugee women, including children's clothing, embroidery, woolen knitwear, paper flowers, toys, clothing, blankets, chair cushions, etc., covering a wide range of categories. In a nutshell, they are all children's products and household sundries. In addition to the exhibition and sale, the Women's Temperance Association is also vigorously promoting the sale of vouchers to the outside world. The four major companies on Nanjing Road, the National Goods Company, and the China Chemical Society have all agreed to provide support and cooperation. Although the exhibition and sale only lasts for four days, after the closing, the products will still be displayed at No. 80 Xieqiao Road for long-term sale. It is hoped that people in society can show great sympathy for a group of refugee women and enthusiastically purchase the society's products, which would also be a great act of kindness!

No Marriage Allowed

When the post office recently recruited junior postal workers, it was said that according to the order of the Postal Administration, only men were allowed to register for the examination, and even female postal assistants in the bureau were not allowed to apply. The reason given was that women are physically weak and inconvenient to dispatch. However, this "consideration" has not been agreed upon by the women's community. On the contrary, they have cited considerable counter-evidence: "Among the personnel recruited in the last examination, the proportion of women who should be transferred to serve in the Southwest was higher than that of men." (See "A Letter from the Shanghai Women's Community to Women Nationwide") It can be seen that the real reason for not accepting women is not this. The real reason, which Europe and America have not yet seen, is the four measures stipulated for restricting the recruitment of female staff in Sichuan. From the third and fourth of these four measures, which state that married women are not allowed to apply and that those who marry after joining the bureau will be dismissed upon their impending marriage, it can at least be guessed that one of the reasons is not allowing marriage.

I remember that our "humorist" once said a famous saying about the art of deception: "The best career for a woman is marriage." Now, the post office's approach is precisely an interpretation of this humorous saying. At present, we cannot deny that there are still some women who only know how to rely on others for a comfortable life. However, looking further afield, in every corner of China, Chinese women have stood up firmly and are participating in any activity and work. If the "humorist's" words were satirizing a certain group of women, then the post office's no-marriage theory is an overly literal interpretation.

Naturally, these are private speculations. During the nationwide war of resistance, even for those backward women, we cannot use humorous satire to make them sink forever. We should make them aware and awaken them. As the "Letter from the Shanghai Women's Community to Women Nationwide" says very clearly: "In recent years, with the rise of the War of Resistance, the country is at a critical juncture. The only way to win is to gather the strength of the nation to serve the country. Our supreme leader has repeatedly warned the people to mobilize all manpower and material resources nationwide to strive for the final victory. Women are also members of the nation, and it is their responsibility to contribute to the country to the best of their ability, and they must not give up their sacred duty." Therefore, we hope that there is a sufficient reason for not recruiting women and for the four measures stipulated for restricting the recruitment of female staff, and that it can be explained or immediately withdrawn.

Clear Skies After Rain

Chapter 17 of Bao Tianxiao's work

Learning External Affairs, Reporters Enter a New Field
Practicing Internal Affairs, Small Training Grounds in School

When someone first recommended Miss Shao Huihua to that newspaper, they thought it was a young lady going to work in external affairs. There were many women working there. They tried her out and assigned her a few easy interviews, mostly about women. However, she was able to handle them happily. Later, they gradually assigned her more difficult tasks, and the gentlemen in the editorial department were very satisfied with her. You should know that investigating news is not a fixed thing; it all depends on the agility of your own mind. As the ancients said, "You can give people rules, but you cannot give them skill." All learning is like this. It's like journalism gives you a main road, but what if the main road is impassable? Can't you find another way? Think about how big the world is, space and time, filling the sky and the earth, are all news, as long as you go find it yourself. Those who are good at finding news only need to sniff in the air to know that there is news there. This is called a "news nose." People with a news nose know where the news is as soon as they sniff. People without a news nose can't smell any news in the air, even if there is good news. Like Miss Shao Huihua, she was born with a news nose. Not only that, but the first thing a journalist needs is to have their own interest. With interest, they don't care about anything, they have a spirit of adventure, and they have a will to endure hardship. If there is something better and more comfortable than being a journalist, and you ask them to do it, they would rather give it up and be willing to do the hard work. Why is this? Because they have that interest, which occupies their loyalty. Although someone is a journalist, the first thing is to have talent, the second is to have cultivation, and the third is to have interest. These three are almost indispensable. First, in terms of talent, it is the person with a news nose that I mentioned above. To some extent, they have a talent for journalism. Otherwise, the same thing happens, and the same people come. Why don't people feel anything, while people with journalistic talent smell the breath of news inside? It's the same with going to interview an important person, and listening to a speech from this important person. Why do people often not hear what he means, what he means outside of what he says, but once a talented journalist hears it, he feels understanding, connects everything, and can uncover his unspoken secrets?

Life Report

A Group Soaked in Copper Dust

Fu Huan

——Words of a Copper Grinding Worker——

Under the sparse moonlight of the autumn night, I was talking to a copper grinding apprentice about his life and background. I stared at his pale face with a bitter smile. I didn't want to smell the fragrance of Liangxiang (?) chestnuts in the night wind, but I didn't ignore every trembling and heavy word that came out of his ashen lips...

You ask me how old I was when I came here? Sigh! You might not believe it when I tell you; I came here as an apprentice at the age of seven. Now I am eighteen years old, and I have been working here for a full ten years, but I have not yet been promoted to clerk, and I am still an apprentice.

The apprentices here, except for me, all have contracts, some for five years, some for six years, because they are sent here by their parents to learn. However, I was bought by my boss with money. So I don't know when I can jump out of this "apprentice" shackle?!

In the first few years, of course, I did chores, wiping copperware and some small and simple tasks. It was still good at that time, because wiping copperware was not done in the workshop (machine room), but in the back patio or outside the door, so my body was much stronger than it is now. Around the age of ten, I started doing copper grinding work. Every day I held moldy black copperware on the machine and rubbed it, letting copper dust enter my nostrils, mouth, throat, eyes... The copper dust sucked away my essence and blood, and I became thinner and thinner day by day. —Speaking of this, his voice became even more serious. He glanced at me, bared his chest. His thin, yellow, and dry chest, you could almost count every one of his twenty-four ribs.

We now have to do sixteen hours of work every day. Apart from eating and sleeping, the rest of the time is spent making copper dust to erode our bodies. Although our work is hard enough, our treatment is really pitifully meager; the highest wage here is Lao Fa's. Indeed, Lao Fa does some work very well, both skillfully and quickly. However, he only gets ten old silver dollars a month. Now I also get three yuan a month. When I first came here, I wasn't qualified to get wages. I only got two dimes in subsidies for haircuts, bathing, pocket money... all from these two dimes. But now I finally have three yuan!

He looked up at the moon covered in black纱, The night was deep. The two cat stars shone their eyes towards the slant west crescent moon; the streets were as silent as dead. He bid me farewell, yawning, and swayed his tired body, hobbled into the door.

Entertainment World

Active Entertainment World in Kunming

Huaisheng

Kunming is located at the intersection of the two major international routes, Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam, making it a transportation hub in the southwest rear area, second only to the temporary capital of Chongqing. Therefore, the population is increasing, the city is prosperous, and the entertainment industry is also experiencing unprecedented development.

Movies

There are currently two cinemas in Kunming, one named "Dazhong" and the other "Yile." "Dazhong" is luxurious in content, with brilliant lights and complete equipment, and seat prices are also expensive, reaching more than one yuan. The films screened are all imported; both Hollywood and Soviet productions are available. Although "Yile" is relatively ordinary, the seat prices are also around one yuan. The films screened are mainly domestic, and films such as "Hua Mulan" and "Diao Chan" have had good success here.

Theaters

There are also only two theaters, one is the "Xin Dian Stage," located at the old site of the Huguang Guild Hall, which specializes in Yunnan opera. Most of the audience are locals. The equipment is simple, and the seat prices are also relatively cheap, between five and six cents. This kind of local opera is generally evolved from Peking opera, so the tones, styles, scripts, and plots are all very similar to Peking opera, and there are also performances by both men and women. The other is the "Xin Sheng Stage," located in Jinbi Park. The equipment is slightly more elaborate than that of the "Xin Dian," and the seat prices are more than one yuan. The theater does not have a fixed basic opera troupe; they come and go and are of a mobile nature. Zhao Ruquan and Huang Yulin have both performed here, and their performances were not bad, especially Zhao Ruquan, who made a very good impression on the people of Kunming.

Drama

The drama movement in Kunming is very developed, and new drama troupes are springing up like mushrooms after rain, with more than a dozen. In terms of nature, those belonging to the student world include the "Yun Da," "Tong Ji," "Lian Da," and the "Dapeng Drama Society" of the Aviation School; those in the youth world include the "Youth Association Drama Troupe"; those in the children's world include the "Children's Drama Troupe"; and those in the primary school teachers and other professional circles include the "Amateur Drama Society." Many plays have been performed in the past two years, including existing ones such as "Sunrise" and "Thunderstorm," and newly written ones such as "Huangpu Moon" and "Flying General," no less than seventy or eighty kinds. Recently, the "National Defense Drama Society" performed Cao Yu's "Wilderness," one of his three major works, at the "Xin Dian," with Cao Yu himself directing. The stage supervisor was Sun Yutang, and the designs were by Wen Yiduo and Lei Guiyuan, all famous figures in the theater world. The cast of actors was complete, and the scenery was particularly magnificent. Therefore, when the play advertisements were posted, although the seat prices were as high as more than two yuan, people still rushed to reserve seats, one after another. The ticket revenue reached more than 10,000 yuan, which can be called a grand event in the Kunming theater world.

Singing and Dancing

The "Wuhan Chorus" and the singing class of the "Ministry of Education Drama Group" led by Chen Dabei successively came here and sowed the seeds of singing. Therefore, now in the streets of Kunming, and even in the corners of the suburbs, you can hear tragic and慷慨 songs. In addition, the strong men of the Miao and Yao ethnic groups trained in the Taoist school, dancing is their masterpiece. Every time there is a comfort and celebration meeting, they have dance performances. Sometimes they march in torchlight processions, singing and dancing, like a raging fire, and the situation is particularly enthusiastic.

In General: The various departments of Kunming's entertainment world are full of vitality and are growing in an active atmosphere.

The True Face of Sai Jinhua in Lushan

Huanlan

The Xuan Gong Theater once performed "Sai Jinhua," which was very popular for a while. According to reports, Sai Jinhua's original name was Zhao Lingfei, and she was from Suzhou, born in the tenth year of Tongzhi. When the "Shen Bao" was founded, she was only one year old. Her life story has been full of changes, which can be described as both lamentable and inspiring. She fell into prostitution in her youth, and as she grew up, she became the wife of an envoy in one leap. After that, she re-entered the red light district and became a冯妇, and married again and again. In her later years, she was displaced and died of illness in a broken house. Yang Yunshi briefly recorded her life story on her tomb, especially the activities of Sai during the entry of the Allied Forces into Beijing, which is described in great detail. His words say, "At the beginning, the Allied Forces took Germany as the head of the Allied Forces because the Boxer Rebellion killed the German Minister Klinkhardt, and appointed Waldersee as the commander of the Eight-Power Allied Forces. Germany, in order to avenge its resentment, ravaged the residents, and the concubines and daughters of officials and gentry committed suicide by throwing themselves into wells and hanging themselves. Later, the Ministry of Rites奏旌節烈者四百餘擋. Lingfei was intimate with Waldersee, and several times spoke to Waldersee in between, so that the troops under the command of the East strictly prohibited淫戮, released those involved, and rescued the people from their difficulties, and Waldersee immediately acted." At that time, Waldersee lived in the Yiluan Palace, and Sai Jinhua could enter and exit without restriction. Liang Qichao also wrote a poem to praise this: "联欢必竟赖此花，售意输情本惯家，银总拥出仪鸾殿，争认娉婷赛二爷." It can be seen that Sai once saved the people from fire and water in those years, and cannot be regarded as an ordinary 平康. However, times are different. According to today's situation, Sai's shameless service to the enemy is a crime against the nation! The attached photo is of her in her youth. The clothes she wears are not beautiful in the eyes of modern people, but they were the most fashionable clothes at that time.

Anecdotes from Paradise

The Strange Cases of Killing a Son for Revenge and Killing a Father

Let's take a look at the accomplices and informants in the two cases. In the "Killing a Son for Revenge" case, Xu forced her daughter to help her commit this inhuman act. The sister, seeing her brother being killed, was shocked and distraught. Holding her beloved brother's hand and foot, she stroked them with her hand and cried non-stop until her mother shouted loudly, and then she threw the them into the jar. Although her mother killed her son due to a temporary lustful impulse, she may have regretted it after the killing. Therefore, she gasped aside, unable to bear to look, but ordered her daughter to pack up the body. However, the case of Zhou Yongjie being murdered by his two sons is quite different from this. The brothers colluded beforehand, and can only be said to be brothers in distress, with no distinction between principal and accessory. After the incident, there was no sorrow or repentance, and their attitude was calm, like a scientist dissecting and experimenting. It is easy to commit this murderous act by closing your eyes and clenching your teeth, but sawing apart requires watching slowly. It is unbearable to do this to a chicken or dog, let alone use this method to deal with a direct relative? The viciousness of the minds of Qin Ji and Qin Xiang is also evident. If these kinds of people are allowed to stand in society, the future disasters will be unimaginable. This is the third point.

Secondly, let's describe the informants in these two cases. After Guan Bao died, his tutor, Mr. Wang, pleaded his case in court on his behalf. In the past, teachers were respected, so it was often said that teachers and students were like father and son. In the feudal era, if a father sent his son to be an official, the teacher could lead him out. Conversely, if a student violated school rules, the teacher could punish him severely and even send him to the government, then the student's father could not lead him out. After Guan Bao's father died, the child relied on the teacher as if he were a strict father. The teacher saw that he did not come to school the next day, and compared it with Guan Bao's last words of farewell the day before. Then, he righteously pleaded his case, captured the evil monk and adulterous woman, and avenged his disciple's strange wrong.

What You Need to Know

All Kinds of Things About the Dahua Grand Theater

Meng He

This journal has reported on the Dahua Grand Theater many times. Recently, I heard all kinds of news from relevant parties, many of which are unknown to the outside world. It seems necessary to describe them in detail. Now, I will describe them in detail as follows:

Opening Date

This is the biggest mystery and what outsiders are waiting to "solve." In fact, the most uncertain thing is the opening date, because the construction project is being rushed day and night, and it is hard to guarantee that there will be no obstacles. The final decision of the authorities is that it will probably be able to meet the ladies of Shanghai around November 20. It is said that the day before the premiere, they plan to invite relevant parties to make a pilgrimage for a visit.

Selected Films

It is a well-known fact that MGM films are selected.

Insects on the Silver Screen

Qu

In the world, no matter what, as long as you put in the effort, there is nothing that cannot be used. Now let me report a little bit of new hope news. Hollywood, which holds the bull of the film industry, has recruited all kinds of actors. In addition to human movie stars, there are also animal movie stars, who also have generous salaries. Now it's even weirder! Insects can also be on the silver screen. It turns out like this: There is a famous actor in Hollywood named Syd Fogel. He can be original and train flies, spiders, beetles, and all kinds of lice to be actors in movies. A drop of syrup can bring his actors together, and weak traces of food can lure them to walk, run, or fly to a destination. Fogel has studied the habits of various insects very well and uses them to play appropriate roles on the silver screen. These acting insects are placed on straps made of fine hair and must be hidden before filming. The insects trained by Korgel need to be very complex, so his work is also very busy.

The company has made full preparations in advance and has more than twenty premiere blockbusters in storage. Like the diva McDonald's "Singing Lovers 1," Weissmuller's "Tarzan Gets a Son," Robert Donat's "A Thousand Years of Teachers," Joan Crawford, "Mitsui Silver Flower," Norma Shearer's "Woman," and Michael's first blockbuster "Full House of Gold" have all been previewed in Shanghai. The five-color fairy tale blockbuster "Wizard of Oz," worth four million gold, has also arrived in Shanghai and will be promoted and mobilized to movie fans throughout Shanghai.

Other special features of the entire theater include: Inside the lobby, there is another rest room, which looks like a suite and has a separate world. The large number of emergency exits provides guests with a lot of convenience. The harmonious color scheme of the entire theater is full of a warm atmosphere. The equipment for air conditioning and heating is, needless to say, the latest model of machinery this year. The most amazing equipment is air conditioning, which can completely exhaust the turbid air of a large theater in an extremely short time of two minutes and transport all the fresh air, so that the body and mind of the audience can get considerable benefits.

What I can report now is all here. In the future, I will report to readers as soon as possible.
