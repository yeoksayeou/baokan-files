### The Chinese Side's Mysterious Troop Movements Control the Northern Section of the Yuehan Railway; Xianning and Tingsiqiao Stations Are Recovered; Attacks Are Being Carried Out Successfully on Both the Northern and Southern Routes; One Unit, Taking Advantage of Victory, Directly Attacks Chongyang City Walls; Fierce Battles Erupted in Nanchang Yesterday Due to Japanese Reinforcements; Street Fighting Occurred Briefly in Fengxin; Wuning Was Also Surrounded by Chinese Troops

(Hong Kong) The Jiangxi Chinese army is still advancing towards Nanchang County; those attacking Wuning are only four or five li from the city; Japanese troops in Fengxin, Anyi, and Jing'an are all surrounded by Chinese troops (Special dispatch, 30th morning).

(Changsha) After the Chinese forces pursued the defeated remnants of the Japanese army from Tongshan to Xianning, a certain unit, using mysterious troop movements, suddenly appeared between Xianning and Tingsiqiao on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway on the morning of the 29th. Dividing into northern and southern routes, they launched attacks on Xianning and Tingsiqiao. The Japanese army hurriedly responded, indiscriminately firing artillery at the Chinese troops. The Chinese troops bravely charged the Japanese, and it is recorded that they recovered both Xianning and Tingsiqiao stations. The advance was still progressing smoothly as of the evening (Dispatch of the 29th).

Pingjiang: Chinese troops pursuing the enemy from Baini Bridge to Chongyang engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese reinforcements inside the city eight li from the city for a night. Japanese corpses littered the field, and they retreated into the city, attempting to fight to the death with their backs to the city. On the 29th, Chinese troops took advantage of their victory and directly assaulted the city walls. Japanese troops who fled to Ma'anshan northwest of Nanlin Bridge were still being surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese forces on the 29th (Dispatch of the 29th).

Fengcheng: The Japanese army in Nanchang has fallen into a situation of being surrounded on three sides. On the evening of the 28th, more than a thousand Japanese reinforcements attempted a counterattack. Fierce battles erupted between Chinese and Japanese forces in the eastern suburbs, and neither side could gain the upper hand. Furthermore, a major fire in Nanchang City has not yet been completely extinguished (Dispatch of the 29th).

(Changsha) Seeing that the situation in Nanchang was hopeless and beyond recovery, the Japanese army has now concentrated its main force between Anyi and Fengxin, attempting a final desperate struggle. On the morning of the 29th, more than two thousand Japanese reinforcements came from Anyi, joining with the original Japanese troops in Fengxin to launch a counterattack against the Chinese army. The Chinese army displayed its divine might, fiercely striking the enemy head-on. After multiple decisive engagements, by 5 PM on the 29th, the Japanese army was finally defeated. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented in recent days. In this battle, countless Japanese soldiers were killed, and two mountain guns, over 350 poison gas bombs, three light machine guns, over 60 rifles, and many other military supplies were seized. The remaining Japanese troops retreated into the city, while another unit retreated to Tao Xianling. The Chinese army is currently pursuing them in victory (Dispatch of the 29th).

(Changsha) The Japanese army in Nanchang is now surrounded on all sides by the large Chinese army. The Luojinta stronghold in the southeastern corner of the city, the Japanese army's only stronghold, was captured on the 29th by a Chinese division commander leading a suicide squad. A certain commander-in-chief also personally directed the attack on the city from the front lines (Dispatch of the 29th).

Fengcheng: Chinese troops besieging Nanchang had already occupied the old airfield on the 26th, and plainclothes teams inside the city also began to respond. After holding out until the morning of the 27th, Japanese reinforcements counterattacked, and the Chinese army retreated to the new airfield for a time. That afternoon, reinforcements for the Chinese army gradually arrived and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army, retaking the old airfield and continuing to advance. The Japanese army in Nanchang is in chaos and is about to collapse (Dispatch of the 29th).

Shanggao: More than a thousand Japanese infantry, multiple tanks, and over ten artillery pieces, covered by Japanese aircraft, fiercely attacked the vicinity of Dacheng on the morning of the 28th. The Chinese troops fought fiercely, and the battle was extremely intense. In the afternoon, the Japanese offensive faltered, and the Chinese troops launched attacks from multiple directions, defeating the Japanese army. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft was shot down, three Japanese tanks were destroyed, and over 400 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded (Dispatch of the 29th).

Fengcheng: The battles south of Nanchang are still in fierce contention. A certain unit of the Chinese army has advanced to a certain place more than ten li north of Liantang, intensifying the siege of Nanchang (Dispatch of the 29th).

Fengcheng: Chinese troops who recovered Shengmi Street have continued to make progress and are advancing north. Furthermore, although the Japanese army at Wanshou Palace has been stubbornly holding out due to reinforcements, after multiple encirclements by the Chinese army, its collapse is not far off (Dispatch of the 29th).

Zhangshu: This afternoon, a Japanese aircraft flew low over Gao'an to scout and was hit by Chinese anti-aircraft machine guns, crashing near the suburbs of Gao'an. The Chinese side is currently searching for it (Dispatch of the 28th).

(Chongqing) According to reliable sources in the Chinese military, it is currently impossible to predict whether the Chinese army will be able to recover Nanchang, as the strength of the Japanese reinforcements arriving from Jiujiang is still unknown. The Chinese army's counteroffensive is not aimed at recovering Nanchang, as the location has already lost its importance to the Chinese army. The true value of this decisive attack lies in disrupting the Japanese army's immediate plans to attack Changsha. If the Japanese army wants to concentrate its forces for another attack, it will still take several months. Another value of this decisive attack is that it has dispelled rumors that the Chinese side is seeking peace with Japan on Japanese terms. This decisive attack has already shown the world that China is prepared to continue the war of resistance and is unwilling to negotiate peace (Dispatch of the 29th, Associated Press).

(Chongqing) According to today's Chinese report, the Chinese army has already broken through the outer defensive works of the Japanese army in Nanchang. The two wings of the Chinese army have also cleared out Japanese outposts from the east and west. The vanguard of the Chinese army has already charged into Nanchang and is engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army. The left wing of the Chinese army has already occupied Shijia Street, Xincun Xu, and Wanshe Street, while the right wing has crossed the Fu River and occupied Fulin Street, and has also occupied the Nanchang New Airfield, five miles from Nanchang. Two thousand Japanese soldiers have moved south along the Gan River, hoping to defeat the Chinese army, but have been repelled at Xiliang Mountain and Zhangjia Mountain. Fierce battles have occurred in Qingyunpu, and the Japanese army has been repelled. Chinese troops surrounding Fengxin are putting pressure on the Japanese garrison. Yesterday, Chinese troops entered Fengxin and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese garrison for several hours before withdrawing. Japanese troops in Wuning are also surrounded. Yesterday, five hundred Japanese soldiers from Ruoxi, covered by twelve tanks and three Japanese aircraft, attempted to break through the Chinese army's encirclement of Wuning, but were ultimately repelled. Today, the Japanese army is attacking again, and the battle is still ongoing (Dispatch of the 29th, Associated Press).

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources received here, the right wing of the Chinese army attacking Nanchang has crossed the Fu River near Wuyang and is continuing to advance towards Nanchang. According to the latest front-line reports, the Chinese army has reoccupied the New Airfield six miles southeast of Nanchang. At the same time, another unit of the Chinese army occupied the old Nanchang Airfield and the railway station on the 27th, establishing contact with other Chinese troops besieging Nanchang. Also, a team of Chinese troops launched a surprise attack on the city walls of Fengxin and charged into the northwest gate of the city on the 27th, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese garrison. The Chinese troops then retreated to positions two miles northwest of the city, awaiting reinforcements (Dispatch of the 29th, Reuters).

Shuxiang: Chinese troops attacking Nanchang from the east bank of the Gan River have moved swiftly. After recovering Wudangang and the Great Buddha Pagoda, they advanced rapidly northwest, crossing the railway line on the evening of the 28th and encircling Liantang and Xiangtang. The Japanese rear route at Liantang and Xiangtang has been cut off by the Chinese and is trapped in an encirclement (Dispatch of the 29th).

Dongxiang: The Japanese army, facing intense encirclement of the two strongholds of Liantang by the Chinese army, sent over a thousand Japanese troops south along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway on the 27th to reinforce, attempting to reverse the disastrous situation in Nanchang. Currently, these Japanese reinforcements are also under encirclement by the Chinese army (Dispatch of the 29th).

Muyang Recovered; Dongkan Town Also Recovered

A Certain Place: The war in northern Jiangsu is progressing daily. Muyang was recovered by the Chinese army on the 25th. Troops surrounding Baoyuan, Huaiyin, and Huaian have recovered Banzha between the two Huai rivers. On the Rugao front, after the Chinese army recovered Tangjiazhai, the Japanese army retreated to the city. Chinese armies in Nantong and Qidong are all launching offensives (Dispatch of the 28th).

A Certain Place in Northern Jiangsu: Chinese attacking troops recovered Dongkan Town, an important Japanese stronghold in Funing, on the 26th, and are now advancing on Funing, taking advantage of their victory (Dispatch of the 29th).

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Chinese guerrillas have achieved major victories on all fronts. Muyang, forty-five miles north of Qingjiangpu, has been recaptured by Chinese guerrillas. At the same time, Panjia and Tangjiazhai, north of Rugao, were also recovered two days ago. The Chinese army is now fiercely attacking the Japanese army entrenched in Rugao, Qingdong (transliteration), and the areas near Qingjiangpu on the north bank of the Yangtze River (Dispatch of the 29th, Associated Press).

### Both Sides Actively Sending Reinforcements; Western Guangdong Prepares for a Major Decisive Battle; Japanese Troops Invading Zhu Liuhe Are Completely Defeated; Japanese Ammunition Depot in Dongguan Burned Down by Chinese Troops; Shantou City Has Fallen Into a State of War

Guilin: On the morning of the 27th, over a thousand Japanese soldiers and nine tanks invaded Heshan along the highway. This morning, the vanguard of the Japanese army has reached Hengkeng. One unit is repairing roads and bridges at Longyanshe, while another unit, with four tanks, is advancing along the Kaiping to Heshan highway towards Danshuikou (Dispatch of the 29th).

Wengyuan: On the morning of the 27th, a team of Japanese cavalry attacked Zhu Liuhe, twenty kilometers north of Heshan City. The Chinese army fired calmly, killing over ten Japanese soldiers, who then fled in defeat (Dispatch of the 29th).

Yingde: The ammunition depot of the Qing Shui Unit of the Japanese army in Dongguan, with over a thousand soldiers, was located in Mingxing Middle School in the west gate. A certain unit of the Chinese army charged into the city on the night of the 19th, killing over thirty Japanese soldiers and burning the ammunition depot. The flames lit up the sky, and the Japanese army suffered heavy losses (Dispatch of the 29th).

Sihui: Approximately two thousand Japanese troops invading Zhu Liuhe, with several artillery pieces attached, were fiercely attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army along the entire line on the morning of the 28th, launching repeated assaults. After a fierce battle until 10 AM, the Japanese army was completely defeated by the Chinese army, with Japanese corpses scattered everywhere. The remnants fled towards Heshan, and the Chinese army is currently pursuing them closely. Furthermore, the Japanese troops crossing the river on the Heqing front were fiercely attacked head-on by the Chinese army and also retreated towards Heqing on the afternoon of the 28th (Dispatch of the 29th).

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, both Chinese and Japanese sides are actively sending reinforcements to the front lines of the West River, preparing for a major decisive battle in the future. Currently, the battles near Heshan and Danshuikou are very intense. The Japanese army is attempting to spy on Kaiping from Danshuikou (Dispatch of the 29th, Fast News Agency).

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, three more Japanese warships arrived outside Shantou Port last night, but there has been no activity yet. Shantou City has now completely fallen into a state of war. From the Qilushi Battery along Waima Road to the area in front of the Customs House, military police armed with rifles are patrolling incessantly. In addition, heavy troops are stationed in both the northern and southern ports belonging to Chenghai County, as these two locations are the only routes through which the Japanese army can attack Shantou (Dispatch of the 29th, Fast News Agency).

(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources in Guangzhou Bay, Japanese troops from Yulin Port in Hainan Island advanced north along the highway from Tengqiao on the 23rd of this month, attempting to attack Lingshui. They were intercepted by Chinese guerrilla forces en route, and after a fierce battle lasting four hours, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and retreated back to Tengqiao. On the 24th, Japanese reinforcements attacked again, and the Chinese army fought bravely, killing over two hundred Japanese soldiers. However, due to the destruction of all fortifications, they retreated to the northwestern suburbs, and Lushui fell on the 25th (Dispatch of the 29th, Fast News Agency).

### Zhangde Airfield Suddenly Attacked by Chinese Troops; Eight Aircraft Destroyed on the Spot; Japanese Guards Captured

Zhengzhou: A certain unit of the Chinese army, using swift and secret movements on the night of the 26th, launched a surprise attack on the airfield occupied by the Japanese army in Zhangde. All twenty-odd Japanese guards were captured. Over ten Japanese aircraft were destroyed by the Chinese army, with eight burned on the spot. The Japanese army in Zhangde rushed to reinforce, and the Chinese army had already escorted the prisoners and retreated to a certain place (Dispatch of the 29th).

Stricter Regulations to Be Imposed on Import Trade

(Chongqing) According to today's financial circles, the Chinese government is currently considering implementing stricter controls on import trade. The government believes that during this time of war resistance, the trade deficit is enormous, and the import of luxury goods is shockingly high. Therefore, it has ordered customs to prohibit the import of such goods as much as possible. At the same time, when merchants apply for foreign exchange to purchase foreign goods, they must choose essential goods to be approved. This plan is in accordance with the government's policy of protecting foreign exchange stability. At the same time, the government is currently striving to increase the export of Chinese products such as tung oil and silk (Dispatch of the 29th, Associated Press).

Editorial

### Hitler's Reply to Roosevelt

Two weeks ago, US President Roosevelt sent a telegram to Germany and Italy, putting forward several very concrete suggestions and asking for a reply. Hitler actually solemnly scheduled his reply for April 28. When the date arrived, Hitler did indeed broadcast his reply, but President Roosevelt, at the time of his speech, paid no attention, indicating that he did not wish to listen. This is truly a humorous matter! The wording of Hitler's reply was already anticipated by the world. Even if he provided any promises in his reply, his promises have never been worth a dime and were insufficient to cause a sensation. Furthermore, President Roosevelt's telegram was less of an inquiry and more of a declaration or warning; the other party's reply, or lack thereof, was fundamentally inconsequential. So, despite Hitler's energetic performance, the audience instead ignored him.

President Roosevelt said that recently two countries in Europe and one in Africa have lost their independence, and a distant country in the Far East is being trampled underfoot. If this situation is not stopped from developing, then a major world disaster is imminent. Therefore, it is necessary to demand that the aggressor countries stop this aggression and maintain world peace. Hitler's reply, however, stated that the responsibility for the loss of independence of those three countries lies entirely with the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and the Treaty of Versailles, and not with the current perpetrators. This kind of talk is the fundamental theory of the aggressor's philosophy of aggression. Hitler saying this on the one hand indicates his quibbling excuses to President Roosevelt; on the other hand, it is nothing less than a declaration that he will continue to apply this aggressive theory and continue to implement his insane acts of aggression. This can be said to be the most important point of Hitler's speech.

President Roosevelt specifically listed thirty countries, large and small, demanding that the aggressors provide assurances that they would not use military force to attack these countries for ten to twenty-five years. He also said that if the aggressors were willing to do so, President Roosevelt would notify the countries in question, asking them to make the same assurances, and then convene an international conference to establish lasting world peace. Hitler, regarding this point, first used a trick to trick the small countries into confessing that they had not been threatened by Germany, and then used these coerced confessions as arguments to give President Roosevelt a hollow reply. He also stated that convening an international conference would not be sufficient to solve the problems, and that Germany was fundamentally unwilling to join so-called arbitration-style meetings. However, the focus of President Roosevelt's question was purely whether the aggressor countries were willing to abandon their policy of aggression. As long as the aggressor countries were willing to change their attitude, the sincere cooperation of the remaining democratic countries would not be a problem. Hitler is certainly no fool; could he not understand that the solution to the problem lies entirely with the aggressors themselves? Yet he deliberately made these changed points of excuse, that is nothing more than expressing that his desire for aggression will never be satisfied, and he is currently unwilling to change his attitude.

Having recognized that the central idea of Hitler's speech is the unchanging attitude of aggression, then his simultaneous announcement of the abolition of the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact was a natural action, not surprising. Moreover, Hitler and his comrades will certainly continue to use aggressive means in the future, attacking any weakness in the world.

However, if we believe that Hitler's speech has already declared the destruction of world justice and the despair of peace, that may not be entirely true. From Hitler's speech, we can also fully see a kind of outwardly fierce but inwardly weak attitude. On the one hand, he made grand pronouncements, elaborating on the philosophy of aggression; on the other hand, he was full of peace and talked about sincerity. Although his promises are never fulfilled, at least it indicates that he does not yet dare to openly challenge, or that he is not yet willing to be the leader of aggression today. Because, from a subjective point of view, Germany's own strength is not yet qualified to be the leader of a second world war. At the same time, the triangular alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has recently had the possibility of splitting due to Japan's hesitant attitude. From an objective point of view, the strength of the democratic front has been strengthened due to Britain's implementation of conscription, the near completion of Anglo-Soviet talks, and the increasingly concrete anti-aggression stance of the United States, etc. If Germany provokes rashly at this time, the result will inevitably be to fall into a quagmire. With Hitler's astuteness, could he not see this? So, the abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, rather than being a strong expression of Germany, is more that Hitler felt threatened by the environment, deliberately putting on a show to cover up his inner panic. Because those agreements had long been regarded as waste paper by the aggressors, the formal abolition is really not a problem.

The direction of Hitler's actions in the future may be to pressure Poland to resolve the Danzig and Corridor issues, and at the same time to make so-called demands to Britain for the return of colonies. However, whether he will launch these new offensives, and whether he will persist in his aggressive attitude, still depends on whether the countries of the democratic front can quickly complete a collective security organization, and exert a united force to extinguish this flame of aggression. Before launching new offensives, Hitlers may also use their usual tricks, using divisive tactics to break up the democratic front, implementing a strategy of divide and conquer. This point is indeed more worthy of attention than his speech, and we ask all peace-loving countries to pay attention!

### Japan Unwilling to Conclude a Military Alliance with Italy and Germany; The War of Aggression Against China Has Reached an Impasse; Perhaps Wanting to Leave Room for Maneuvering; London Circles Attach Great Importance To This

(London) Today, all the newspapers here are focusing on the fact that the Japanese Five Ministers have been discussing the issue of changing the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance for several days. It is generally believed that although Germany is putting heavy pressure on Japan to achieve its goal, the alliance has not been established. The fact that Hitler did not mention Japan in his speech seems sufficient to confirm this view. According to a telegram from the Tokyo correspondent of the Times, prominent non-political figures are very averse to this kind of alliance, or deeply aware that this move contains endless troubles in the future. This can be seen in their private conversations. Although they are not in political circles, they occupy a rather high representative position among the Japanese. Some newspapers believe that the greatest concession the Japanese government can offer is to ally with Germany only to resist the Soviet Union. This coincides with the opinion expressed to Reuters by well-informed Japanese people in London, that is, Japan will only participate in the European war when attacked by the Soviet Union. According to qualified observers, the Japanese navy is also very opposed to this kind of alliance, because it is completely incompatible with Japan's traditional policy. However, President Roosevelt's appeal to the dictators and the deployment of the US fleet to the Pacific have indeed caused an unfavorable impression on the Japanese who do not wish to antagonize the United States. Officialdom also holds the view that the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan will not be established. Recently, Japan's attitude towards Britain has been more moderate than before. The fierce anti-British attitude, which was almost a threat a year ago, has visibly weakened, and it seems more willing to listen to British advice. Now, if it is thought that the British government is busy with matters in Europe and will forget its interests in the Far East, this is a great mistake. According to Reuters, the situation is exactly the opposite. As for the means to be used, it will naturally depend on the trend of events. The Financial News newspaper has a long article criticizing the almost complete failure of the Japanese attempt to control foreign exchange and imports in North China. The fact that commerce has not completely stopped seems to be due to the Japanese probably being aware of the seriousness of the problem, so they have not made a firm effort to implement all the new regulations. However, it is uncertain when the Japanese will take this action, so it is impossible to place long-term or even short-term orders. The progress of the recent Chinese army offensive has been given close attention by the general public. Chinese sources may be overly excited, but there is no doubt that the Chinese army has won solid victories. However, when military observers met with Reuters, they doubted whether it was a wise move for the Chinese army to try to recover famous cities such as Nanchang and Guangzhou in the current stage of the war. After the recovery, although there will be a great effect on morale, on the one hand it will force the Japanese army to make a comeback, so the initial hopes of the Chinese army may inevitably be destroyed by this. The "kite of peace" still flies intermittently in the sky, but it is not clear from which side it is released. At present, there is clearly no possibility of building a bridge so that the two belligerent countries can communicate with each other (Dispatch of the 29th, Reuters).

Japan is Deeply Wary of the Soviet Union; Heavy Troops Stationed in Manchuria; Border Defenses Fortified

(Tokyo) According to news from here today, Japan is still wary of the Soviet Union. Although Japan's war against China has entered a stage of all-out struggle, Japan still has heavy troops stationed in the "Manchukuo" area. For example, a very large airfield and aircraft depot have been built near Changchun, and the one in Hailar is even larger in scale. At the same time, troops are often transferred back and forth, showing military might. Defenses have also been built and troops stationed in the Inner Mongolia area. Troop ships patrol in the area adjacent to the Russian border. Although the defenses built cannot be compared to the scale of the Maginot Line, strongholds, artillery forts, anti-aircraft gun positions, gas stations, and ammunition depots have been built in all strategic locations, with cavalry used for communication. Here, they are paying close attention to the talks between Britain and the Soviet Union, fearing that the results of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations will be unfavorable to Japan in the Far East (Dispatch of the 29th, Associated Press).

Secretary-General of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly Appointed

(Chongqing) The National Government issued an order on the 29th, appointing Luo Wenmo as the Secretary-General of the Provisional Assembly of Sichuan Province. This is the order (Dispatch of the 29th).

Chinese Troops in Hubei Recover Yuejiakou

After a fierce battle lasting five hours, the Japanese army could not withstand the attack and collapsed towards Tianmen. The Chinese army then recovered Yuejiakou yesterday and is now attacking the Japanese army in Tianmen (Dispatch of the 29th, Fast News Agency).

### Thirty-Two Japanese Aircraft Rampaged in Eastern Zhejiang Yesterday; Huangyan, Linhai, Haimen, and Yongjia; Bombing in Batches Followed by Strafing; Over Two Hundred Civilian Houses Destroyed

The attack on Linhai occurred at 9:15 AM, dropping nine bombs and destroying over sixty civilian houses. The attack on Haimen occurred at 9:50 AM, dropping four bombs on the urban area, half of which were incendiary bombs, destroying over eighty civilian houses. The attack on Wenzhou occurred at 1 PM, dropping eleven bombs outside the west gate, destroying over sixty houses and wounding one person (Dispatch of the 29th).

### Military Affairs Committee Production: Outline of Battlefield Propaganda

(D) Key Propaganda Points for the Enemy and Puppets: (1) Propaganda work directed at the enemy is a direct attack on the enemy in political warfare. It attacks the enemy from the spiritual aspect, shakes their will to fight, disintegrates their morale, and promotes the trend of anti-war mutiny and awakening to come over to our side. Its effect is sometimes greater than that of armed combat. (2) In the second phase of the War of Resistance, propaganda directed at the enemy is not only more necessary but also has a greater possibility of smooth development. First, the Japanese pirates' war of aggression against China is not for the benefit of the entire country but for the benefit of a small number of privileged classes, that is, a small number of ambitious warlords (the violent faction within the military) and some shameless enemies of bureaucratic politicians. Even within the military cliques and financial cliques, there are often open and secret struggles due to uneven distribution of spoils. At the same time, the people of Korea and Taiwan, who have always been under the control and enslavement of the Japanese, also resent them and never forget to take the opportunity to break away. The above situation provides us with an opening to carry out propaganda against the enemy. Second, because China is fighting heroically, the Japanese pirates' strategy of "quick victory" and the conspiracy of quick peace have failed. The war has been prolonged indefinitely, and as the international situation becomes more and more isolated, the burden of military expenses is increasing day by day, and it is difficult to collect taxes. Therefore, the mood of the people against the war and the soldiers weary of war is increasing day by day, which makes it more convenient for us to carry out propaganda against the enemy. Third, after the War of Resistance entered the second phase, the enemy's superior weapons became less powerful, and they had to hesitate to venture deep. Because it is not easy to obtain superficial victories in military affairs, the exaggerated and deceptive propaganda that has always been carried out has suddenly lost its effectiveness. Therefore, in the second phase of the War of Resistance, foreign aggression has lost its role in easing internal conflicts and has instead become the cause of promoting internal conflicts. The collapse of the Konoe Cabinet and the internal contradictions of the Hiranuma Cabinet are clear evidence of this, which gives us a great convenience to carry out propaganda against the enemy. (3) Our War of Resistance against Japan is different from the Japanese military's aggressive war. We are fighting for national survival and national independence, and we are fighting for world peace and human justice. Therefore, in propaganda, we are also justified. Not only do we not use deception in domestic propaganda, but we also do not need deceptive means in propaganda against the enemy. We only need to state the truth directly and cite facts to shatter the enemy's deceptive propaganda, which is enough to become powerful propaganda and gain the trust of enemy and puppet officers and soldiers. Therefore, (A) we must understand how the Japanese soldiers and the Japanese military's war of aggression have caused enormous damage to them and their country. The war gives them and their families only hunger and death. For their country, it only consumes national power and lowers its international status. The only ones who benefit from the war of aggression are a small number of warlords and financial groups and their lackeys. We must tell them the difference between friend and foe. The enemy of the Japanese soldiers is not China but the warlords who are in charge of the invasion of China. China, in the position of sympathizing with the Japanese soldiers' anti-war, is their absolute friend. At the same time, tell them that this kind of anti-war struggle has the support of the people who love justice at home and abroad and the democratic countries who are willing to maintain peace, and China is their backing. Therefore, their only way out is to change the aggressive war against China into an anti-war war to overthrow the domestic warlords. (B) We must tell the soldiers from Korea and Taiwan that their desperate sacrifice for the small number of Japanese military and financial groups in China only increases their own suffering and intensifies the oppression and exploitation of the Japanese. They can only take the opportunity to rise up, turn the weapons in their hands, and strike at their true enemies, the small number of Japanese military and financial groups, in order to gain national and personal liberation and freedom. (C) We must tell all the puppet troops that they should not be deceived by the propaganda of the Japanese pirates and traitors to fight their own brothers and be cannon fodder for the enemy. They should think about it. When they are forced to the front line, their families are suffering from the oppression and surveillance of the Japanese pirates, and they are starving and working as beasts of burden for the enemy. They must turn their guns around, kill the enemy and puppet officers, and come over to our side to drive out the enemy pirates and recover the lost territory. (4) In order to increase the strength of our political offensive and the effectiveness of our propaganda against the enemy, we must treat prisoners of war favorably. The highest leader, in his work on the War of Resistance, should pay special attention to the points that indicate "striving to capture prisoners of war alive and treating prisoners of war favorably, and prohibiting the killing of prisoners of war. Treating prisoners of war favorably is not only a matter of humanity and international law, but also a matter of convenience in combat and political propaganda. Strive to win over prisoners of war to help us with our propaganda against the enemy, and disintegrate the puppet troops and shake the enemy troops, because this kind of treatment is enough to show: (A) Our benevolence and the enemy's violence, and attacking the enemy in the political aspect. (B) Shattering the enemy's deceptive propaganda that China kills prisoners of war, eliminating their fear, reducing their resistance to the death, and avoiding our unnecessary sacrifices. (5) Our method of treating prisoners of war: First, we must respect their personality and do not hurt their feelings. Treat them as our friends and strive to transform them into comrades-in-arms who will overthrow the Japanese military. Second, we must first reassure them. The wounded must be treated before interrogation. Third, do not threaten or deceive them during interrogation. Be patient and do not expect to get results immediately. Keep their secrets and do not allow reporters to take pictures or interview them at will. They must be sent to the rear as quickly as possible. Fourth, after they are sent to the detention center, they must be actively influenced and educated.

Discipline and Spirit

(Chou) Discipline and spirit of battlefield propaganda personnel.

Propaganda workers are in a more difficult environment and bear a greater mission. Therefore, they must have a spirit of arduous struggle. After the start of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the highest leader and the minister have given earnest instructions to the political workers on the discipline and spirit that they should abide by in their speeches to the political workers. (1) Regarding discipline, the highest leader said in his speech to the political workers' conference, "Political workers must show correct influence on officers and soldiers in their lives and actions, so that they will not only not doubt but also believe, and then all work will be implemented without failure." The minister also gave specific instructions: "In addition to the original regulations, the following principles are hereby formulated for political work discipline: "Set the discipline of the troops according to the labor of the people." "Set the achievements of political work according to the discipline of the troops." Battlefield propaganda workers must strictly abide by and practice what they advocate in order to correct people's absurd concepts of propaganda work. (2) The progress of propaganda work is closely related to the self-cultivation of the workers. Therefore, propaganda workers must work hard to cultivate themselves in order to gain the belief of the people being propagandized. First, they must set an example. The highest leader instructed us, "The attitude and actions of political workers must be fair, and their lives must be frugal. The so-called "teaching by words" is not as good as "teaching by example, and the speed and magnitude of influence are great." The minister instructed, "Our political workers must also do propaganda in their lives, and take the life before money equal to the life of the soldiers and the life in the rear equal to the life of the people as the standard. Propaganda should be based on practicing what one preaches, not empty talk. Second, they should have the service spirit of communication soldiers and cooks. The minister instructed, "Our political workers should have the spirit of communication soldiers, "getting up early and sleeping late," these are all very important work creeds. Only by doing these two points can they be respected and become a role model. In the battlefield, doing propaganda work, including propaganda work against the enemy, should have the spirit of a cook, "working before the troops and resting after the troops." Third, they must study, learn, and reflect at any time. We should study carefully, learn carefully, and reflect humbly at any time and anywhere, according to the people and the events, and accept the valuable experience of blood to create our new way of working for victory. (Note) Regarding "the current situation after the start of the second phase of the War of Resistance," it has been seen in the Outline of Propaganda for the Second Phase of the War of Resistance previously issued by this department, so it will not be recorded again.

Tearing Up Non-Aggression Pact

### Germany Severely Threatens Poland, Attempting to Seize Danzig, Poland Expresses Determination to Defend Territorial Sovereignty, Willing to Resolve Danzig Issue on Equal Principles

Danzig Free City: In the speech delivered by German Führer Hitler today, there was a section involving the city of Danzig. National Socialist Party members all expect that the city will be incorporated into Germany on May 1. Police leave has been temporarily cancelled, and the Stormtroopers of the National Socialist Party have also been ordered to be on standby. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Danzig City: Last night, the people here listened to Führer Hitler's speech to the Reichstag with a joyful mood. They were deeply impressed by his statement that "Danzig cannot belong to Poland forever" and believed that the return of Danzig to Germany was only a matter of time. (Haitong dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) Hitler's speech has been commented on by experienced observers who believe that Poland is now in the same situation as Czechoslovakia in 1938 and will be sacrificed to Germany's eastward expansion policy. However, Führer Hitler will go to his villa in Berchtesgaden for a rest after the celebration of National Labor Day on May 1, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will also go to Hungary next month to return the visit. (The Hungarian cabinet members are scheduled to arrive here tomorrow.) It can be seen that Germany may not take any action against Poland immediately. As for the plans Germany intends to implement, they will mostly start with propaganda to incite various ethnic minorities within Poland, which is no different from what they did to Czechoslovakia. At the same time, they should also make diplomatic efforts in Southeast Europe, especially in Romania, to isolate Poland. However, this kind of plan takes a long time and is much more difficult than dealing with Czechoslovakia before. This is also admitted by German political figures. Observers also said that Germany has long coveted the Ukrainian region and recently proposed to Poland that they jointly conquer it, but Poland refused to accept it for fear of becoming a German appendage. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

German Note

(Berlin) The German government has sent a note to the Polish government, announcing the abrogation of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 26, 1934. The reason for this is the same as for the abrogation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935, stating that the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact stipulated that the signatory countries should not use force to resolve disputes. Now Poland has concluded an agreement with Britain, promising to provide assistance even if a conflict that could occur between Britain and Germany is initiated by Britain. This is in conflict with the German-Polish Pact. Regardless of the form of the Anglo-Polish agreement, it should be regarded as a real alliance aimed at Germany. This can be seen from the process of the agreement and the current international situation. Poland would rather abandon the security provided by Germany and accept the promise of assistance from a third country. In other words, it is unwilling to adopt a friendly discussion method to resolve the outstanding issues between the two sides. The intention is obvious. As for the fact that the existing alliance treaty between Poland and France was established earlier and recognized by the German-Polish Pact, this is different from the nature of Poland joining the British alliance system five years after the establishment of the German-Polish Pact and cannot be generalized. "In short, the actions of the Polish government are willingly serving a policy initiated by other countries, a policy aimed at encircling Germany. Looking back, Germany has always pursued an extremely friendly policy towards Poland, and has taken into account all the interests of Poland. The fact that Poland and Hungary were able to connect their territories was achieved thanks to Germany's assistance, which can be used as proof. Germany also wants to seek a solution to the only outstanding issue between Germany and Poland, the Free City of Danzig, based on the same spirit." The proposal has been explained by Führer Hitler in his speech. This is the minimum reasonable requirement, and its intention is nothing more than to clarify the relations between Germany and Poland. However, the Polish government firmly refused to accept it and also carried out a partial mobilization, which shows that Poland believes that its answer is not enough to promote a friendly agreement. For the sake of Poland, if it could accept Germany's proposal, the Danzig issue could be resolved fairly, and the border between Germany and Poland could be firmly guaranteed by Germany, thereby enriching the good-neighborly friendship. Wouldn't that be a good thing? It is a pity that the Polish government did not do this, and the good opportunity was lost. Instead, it accepted political obligations from a third country, which is in conflict with both the spirit and the text of the German-Polish Pact and has unilaterally eliminated the effect of this pact. Although the German government does not intend to change its basic attitude towards Poland, it is still willing to conclude a new agreement with it. However, this agreement must stipulate "clear and binding obligations" for both parties. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Hitler's Speech: Like a Play

(Berlin) Hitler's speech lasted for two and a half hours. The slowness of his speech and the theatrical manner were unusual. The listeners knew that the key points were to attack the treaties of Britain and Poland. When Hitler read the names of the countries mentioned in President Roosevelt's appeal for peace, the house was filled with laughter. When he mentioned Liechtenstein, it also caused a big laugh. When he mentioned Palestine, the audience roared for half a minute. In addition to the 888 members of parliament, there were also tens of millions of people listening, because his speech was broadcast by radio to all corners of the earth. Hitler's attack on President Roosevelt's remarks was almost entirely as expected by the newspapers, so this part of the speech was not surprising. Everyone knew that Hitler would reject President Roosevelt's proposal, but now they just wanted to hear Hitler explain the reasons for the rejection in detail. The public believes that Hitler's speech may be the prelude to German newspapers strengthening their attack on Poland. In the past few days, German newspapers have repeatedly published reports of Poland's abuse of German expatriates. Political circles believe that Hitler's willingness to provide guarantees when various countries apply for guarantees is by no means accepting President Roosevelt's appeal. This kind of guarantee will be purely a matter between Germany and the countries concerned, so any infringement has nothing to do with a third country. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Polish Reply

Warsaw: After the German government submitted a note to the Polish government yesterday, declaring the abrogation of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934, the Polish government immediately submitted a reply, stating several things: (1) This treaty was initiated by the late Chief of Army Education of Poland, General Piłsudski, and not by German Führer Hitler. (2) The mutual assistance agreement concluded between Britain and Poland is completely in harmony with the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. In addition, Germany has already provided guarantees for the security of Italy and Slovakia, so why shouldn't Poland be said to be in conflict with the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact? (3) The Danzig Free City issue has always been considered by Germany and Poland to be a non-essential issue and not enough to cause a dispute. (4) Regarding the legal status of the Danzig Free City, the Polish government is still willing to discuss amendments with Germany in a friendly spirit, but it must be on an equal footing and take into account the interests of both parties. In addition, the Polish government should also propose suggestions such as: (1) The current system of the Danzig Free City should be maintained, but the post of High Commissioner of the League of Nations may be abolished. (2) The Free City should still be placed under the Polish customs system. (3) Residents of the Free City, both German and Polish, should be allowed to freely develop their culture. Foreign Minister Colonel Beck will deliver a statement in the House of Representatives in the short term to discuss the relations between Germany and Poland. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

Warsaw: After the German government sent a note to Poland, abrogating the Non-Aggression Pact of 1934, Polish Foreign Ministry officials are studying it. Official sources refused to comment, but sources close to the government claimed that Poland is always prepared to discuss all issues of concern to both sides with Germany, but any attempt to force Poland to accept any new measures by fait accompli or oppression will not only be rejected by us, but will also be given a proper response. As far as the issue of the Free City of Danzig is concerned, Germany and Poland have always agreed that bilateral relations should not be impaired by this non-essential "local" issue, but the German government's attitude has obviously changed. As far as the traffic money that Germany passes through the Polish Corridor is concerned, although Poland is prepared to give Germany various conveniences, it cannot allow the country to enjoy extraterritoriality in the Polish Corridor, because extraterritoriality has nothing to do with traffic issues and is enough to undermine the institutions of a sovereign state. The reasons given by the German side for abrogating the Non-Aggression Pact are nothing more than the fact that the newly established mutual assistance agreement between Britain and Poland is in conflict with it. It is well known that the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact has already stipulated that Poland may continue to cooperate with Western European countries. Moreover, Polish Ambassador to Germany Lipski requested a meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the 6th of this month, but was rejected by him. German Ambassador to Poland Moltke has returned to his country to report on his work and has not yet returned to his post, so Germany and Poland have been unable to make any contact since the beginning of this month. It can be seen how meticulously Germany is planning. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Danzig Free City: A Disturbance Occurred

Danzig Free City: Most Germans in this city have gathered at the crossroads since 11:30 a.m. to listen to the speech of German Führer Hitler in front of the radio broadcasting station. However, the attitude of the Germans is not consistent. Most anti-National Socialist Party members have distributed leaflets throughout the city, advising citizens not to listen to this speech. The Poles, who oppose everything, are even more out of the question. The local authorities, after the end of Führer Hitler's speech, printed the full text of the speech into a complaint and posted it on various thoroughfares, but it was mostly torn up by the anti-National Socialist Party members. The Standing Committee had no choice but to order the police to monitor it. In addition, many disturbances have occurred between Germans and Poles. Local National Socialist Party leader Forster has recently issued a book to the Stormtroopers, urging them to be calm and prescribing that the team will hold a large-scale exercise in the city in June of this year. (Havas, 28th)

Hitler's Speech: No Mention of Anti-Communism, Probably Wanting to Befriend the Soviet Union: This Point is Very Noteworthy

(Paris) German Führer Hitler's speech yesterday did not involve racism and communism. This point has been noted by observers here. It is said that after Hitler incorporated millions of Czechs into the German Reich, it would be unavoidable to give others a handle if he continued to call for racism. The intention of the communist stratum is more complicated. According to common sense, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and even Romania and Poland do not trust the Soviet Union. Hitler can use this as an excuse to attack the Communist Party. But now it is not the case, that is, the German radio stations have not attacked the Soviet Union since the last month. It is intended that Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin happened to arrive in the capital of Turkey yesterday. Since the Soviet Union and Turkey have maintained close relations, if Hitler attacks the Soviet Union, he will inevitably indirectly prompt Turkey to quickly join the collective security initiated by Britain and France, so he did not mention it. In addition, the relationship between Germany and Poland is becoming more and more serious. Hitler may want to please the Soviet Union so that it will refuse to interfere, or he may want to prevent the Soviet Union from establishing an agreement with Britain and France to guarantee the territorial integrity of Poland and Romania. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

### German Government Note: Unilaterally Abrogated Naval Agreement: British Naval Circles Believe It is Insignificant: Prepare to Submit a Reply in the Short Term

(Berlin) According to reports here, the German government has handed over a full text of Führer Hitler's speech to the US Chargé d'Affaires in Germany as a reply to President Roosevelt's call for peace. The German Chargés d'Affaires to Britain and Poland also submitted a memorandum to the British and Polish governments at the same time, declaring the cancellation of the Anglo-German Naval Treaty and the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. The German memorandum to Britain recalled British Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration in Munich, stating that he and the German Führer both believed that the Anglo-German Naval Treaty was a symbol of the two Germans' shared desire to never wage war against each other, and that the German government often maintained this wish and continued to be encouraged by it. At the same time, it expressed regret that Britain's recent policies were becoming increasingly distant from those adopted by Germany. The memorandum ended by saying that Germany did not want the abrogation of the treaty to affect the provisions on the quality of warships, and hoped that this matter would contribute to avoiding unrestricted naval arms competition among countries. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

(London) According to a Reuters naval correspondent, people here are not very surprised by Hitler's decision to abrogate the Anglo-German Naval Treaty, because this matter was expected. Although officials have not yet issued a criticism, naval affairs researchers generally believe that the abrogation of this treaty does not actually make much difference, because once the British navy is inspired, the German navy will in fact be unable to catch up. Germany's large-scale shipbuilding program will become a severe and heavy economic burden. Moreover, various warships, especially large ones, cannot be built overnight. Therefore, it is believed that Germany's naval construction seems to be focusing on submarines. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

(London) The German abrogation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 has been commented on by diplomatic figures here, saying that the British government will submit a reply in the short term, stating that this agreement cannot be abrogated at will, and that the supplementary agreement of July 17, 1937, which stipulated the exchange of shipbuilding information, is also of a permanent nature and will not expire until December 1942. Now that Germany has declared it invalid, it is legally unfounded. As for Germany's so-called "encirclement policy," it is also unfounded. On the contrary, the British government has not yet made any suggestions regarding Germany's willingness to provide non-aggression ties." (Havas dispatch, 29th)

### President Roosevelt: To Deliver a Speech Today: To Make Another Appeal for Peace: In Order to Reply to Hitler

Hyde Park: According to sources close to Roosevelt last night, Roosevelt may reply to Hitler's speech at the opening ceremony of the New York World's Fair on Sunday. Some observers believe that the US President will once again, in the guise of peace, criticize the arrogance of European totalitarian countries. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

(New York) The New York Times believes that Hitler's blatant demand for "living space" will be a disturbing factor in the situation, because his purpose is not trade but colonies. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### Hitler's Verbal Onslaught, Roosevelt's Dream Undisturbed

Hyde Park: The President's Secretariat has issued a public announcement stating that when German leader Hitler delivered his speech today, President Roosevelt was asleep. He only awoke at 8:20 AM, after the speech had concluded, and will not be issuing any comments on the speech.

### German Leader's Speech Evokes Reactions from Various Countries, Britain and France Believe It Has Failed to Ease the Situation, and Attempts to Divide the Democratic Front Will Surely Fail

(London) The British press generally views Hitler's speech as having made little difference to the situation. However, some newspapers perceive ominous signs in Hitler's remarks concerning Poland. The Times states that the most significant aspect of Hitler's speech is his assertion that Germany has never taken action to infringe upon the rights of other nations. Hitler's audacious pronouncement implies that Germany is blameless in the current issues. If Germany genuinely desires cooperation, other nations would readily welcome it, including on the issue of colonies. In a peaceful and progressive world, anything is possible. Colonial powers such as Britain could consider sharing any specific benefits derived from their colonies with other nations on a reciprocal basis. However, in a dark forest, such things are impossible. The Daily Telegraph reports that Hitler's speech leaves the international situation unchanged. Hitler's true intentions remain undisclosed, merely confirming the suspicion that he is still filled with resentment. The Daily Herald suggests that Hitler seemed compelled to subtly imply to his own people that he would not be the instigator if war were to break out, creating the impression that war would not erupt immediately. However, even this impression is tempered by extreme caution, as Hitler's remarks about Poland contain malice and may prove to be the most significant part of the entire speech. The speech makes no mention of Britain's implementation of conscription or the Anglo-French talks with the Soviet Union, which is likely significant. Undoubtedly, Britain's recent actions and President Roosevelt's plea for peace have altered Hitler's tone. The lesson to be learned is to expedite the work that has already begun. The News Chronicle states that the general impression left by Hitler's speech is that he is attempting a subtle maneuver: appeasing Britain while threatening Poland to sow discord. Hitler's current attitude toward Poland mirrors his previous approach to Czechoslovakia, aiming to isolate it from the rest of the world so that he can impose his will and satisfy his desires. The Daily Mail reports that Hitler's speech gives people more hope for peace than a week ago. British officials consider the speech relatively moderate but question its sincerity. Whether the recent engagement is based on a genuine desire to maintain peace remains to be proven by future actions. (Reuters, 28th)

(Paris) The Parisian press views German leader Hitler's speech yesterday with suspicion. They generally believe that although the tone is more moderate, the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement have already been declared null and void. Hitler's exclusive favor toward France is clearly intended to divide the ranks of democratic nations, but this tactic is unlikely to succeed. Furthermore, Hitler's speech does not seem to contribute to easing the international situation, which remains unstable. The right-wing Figaro reports: "The main intention of Hitler's speech is to reassure Germany. The deleted telegram from U.S. President Roosevelt has triggered a major reaction within Germany, which is evident in this speech." Le Petit Parisien reports: "The international situation will not change due to this speech. Hitler's hostility is concentrated on Britain and Poland, while treating France with relative leniency. In reality, Britain, France, and Poland have already decided to unite and resist the current common crisis, and no one in those countries can be swayed by this tactic." L'Écho de Paris reports: "Even the most appealing statements from 'that' country cannot make it a nation of peace. We must continue to take precautions against that country to avoid future mistakes." L'Ordre reports: "Hitler's speech reveals undeniable difficulties and hesitation. He seems to be at a crossroads, still undecided whether to openly engage in war or continue using tactics of terror and intimidation while simultaneously proclaiming peace."

Socialist Party leader Léon Blum published an article in the party's newspaper, "Le Populaire," stating: "The issue of war and peace will be decided by actions, not words. Will Hitler take action? There are currently no signs of it. American intervention, the firm stance of Britain and France, and the formation of a united front of democratic nations may prompt Hitler to pull back from the brink, but it is not certain." (Havas, 29th)

### Peace Proposal Rejected, United States Greatly Disappointed

(Washington) The government believed last night that German leader Hitler's speech in the Reichstag greatly diminished the hope of resolving European disputes through peaceful negotiations. The U.S. Congress also believes this speech is a harbinger of an imminent war crisis. The White House and the State Department have issued no formal criticism of Hitler's speech, but private comments indicate that Hitler's speech does not reduce the likelihood of war. According to sources close to the White House, officials are extremely indignant at Hitler's response to the U.S. President's recent peace appeal in this manner, considering it a diplomatic discourtesy on Germany's part. Government officials also state that Hitler's speech cannot be regarded as a formal response to the U.S.'s written proposal. Observers generally believe that the central question of President Roosevelt's telegram to Hitler was whether Germany would adopt a policy of force or be willing to resolve everything through peaceful negotiations. However, Hitler expressed opposition to both international conferences and the U.S.'s proposals. Attention is also being paid to Hitler's repudiation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, as it is expected to stiffen the U.S. Navy's construction program, just as it has done for Britain. Because Japan is already aligned with the Rome-Berlin Axis, the increase in Germany's naval power may become the main reason for the global naval forces to become intertwined. The only official criticism from the White House came from President's Secretary, Mr. Early, who refuted Hitler's claim that the President had disclosed his peace proposal to the world before sending it to Germany. Mr. Early stated that the peace appeal was telegraphed to Berlin at 9:00 PM (Eastern Standard Time) on April 14th and was announced to the press at 10:30 AM on April 15th. (Associated Press, 29th)

(Washington) Regarding the content of German leader Hitler's speech, with the exception of certain Communist figures who believe that the door to negotiations has not been completely closed, members of Congress generally feel that it has a negative impact. They say that a movement to revise the current Neutrality Act to facilitate the democratic countries of Europe has now been encouraged. In particular, Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is the most ardent proponent of facilitating the democratic nations, but has yet to express his opinion. The views of various congressmen are summarized below:

(1) Former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Borah (Republican), declared: "All discussions regarding the issue of peace have come to an end due to Hitler's speech."

(2) Speaker of the House, Bankhead, stated: "This answer seems to be ambiguous, and is insufficient to maintain peace in Europe. Leader Hitler claims he wishes to maintain peace in Europe, but his speech is full of underlying threats of aggression."

(3) Acting Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bloom, declared: "Historically, speeches that are sardonic and invert right and wrong should rank this speech as foremost. It can also be seen how the German people are numbed by Leader Hitler and follow his views. In short, although Hitler strongly argues that he wishes to live in peace with all countries, he almost immediately presented Poland with an ultimatum. This is his usual tactic, and the world should already be aware of it."

(4) Senator Bone (isolationist) from Washington State (Democrat) stated: "Although Hitler's speech is surprising, it contains nothing new. The nations of Europe have been in conflict with each other for over a thousand years. If war breaks out in the future, the United States must not get involved in the vortex." (Havas, 28th)

(5) Congressman Logan, a Democrat from Kentucky, said, "The speech can be divided into three parts: lying, evasion, and denial."

(6) Representative Fish, a Republican from New York and a major critic of the President's foreign policy, said, "I do not believe there will be a European war this year." (Associated Press)

Congressman Bloom, a Democrat from New York and acting chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, "Hitler's speech lasted for two hours, but there were no new developments." (Associated Press, 29th)

### Soviet Commentary: Treaties Not Respected, Germany Cannot Be Trusted

(Moscow) Sources here generally state that the main points of Hitler's speech were anticipated by the Soviet press last week, so it was not surprising. The announcement to abandon the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish Pact proves that agreements with Germany are worthless and reinforces the need to maintain close cooperation with peace-loving countries. (Reuters, 28th)

(Moscow) When German leader Hitler delivered his speech yesterday, it was broadcast abroad simultaneously, but Moscow was unable to hear the full text because Soviet radio stations were also broadcasting programs at the same time, causing interference. Therefore, none of the newspapers here mentioned a single word about it last night. (Haitong, 28th)

### Aggressor Nations Colluding, Italian and Japanese Newspapers Voice Support for German Policies

(Rome) Fascist figures here are offering unreserved welcome for German leader Hitler's speech today, and are endorsing his reaffirmation of the relationship between Germany and Italy, and express their approval for Italy’s advance into Albania. They hold that looking at Germany’s abrogation of the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement, one knows that the country has already determined to resist Britain’s “encirclement policy." Mussolini's spokesman, Gayda, published an article in the Italian Daily News, stating: "This speech is sufficient to indicate that Germany is powerful and strong, and how the country's power is extremely reliable, even its allied nations can depend on it in times of need. Leader Hitler has moreover reaffirmed the historical stance adopted by the Axis nations, and has issued warnings to the governments who, with offensive intentions, are attempting to safeguard the interests of imperialism." (Havas, 28th)

(Tokyo) Tokyo newspapers are running Hitler's speech on their front pages with shocked expressions. An editorial in the "Asahi Shimbun" says that Britain, the US and France have implied that if war breaks out, Germany and Italy would bear the blame. Hitler's speech now fully proves the inaccuracy of this implication. They are trying to get what they believe is due to them without resorting to such terrible means, but the facts are the opposite. Although Britain and France are eager to maintain the status quo, they will ultimately lead the countries to war. Poland's arrogant attitude toward Germany is similar to Czechoslovakia's arrogance in September last year. Britain and Poland formed an agreement because of this, but the agreement did not contribute to a peaceful solution to the German-Polish dispute. Hitler has now clearly stated that he is willing to give a non-aggression guarantee to all countries, so Britain and France should seriously re-examine their policies. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" claims that Britain is using a dual policy of intimidation and compromise towards Germany, but Hitler announced yesterday his unwavering determination not to change Germany's foreign policy. If Britain does not change its provocative attitude, Anglo-German relations cannot return to normal. The only way to save the world from catastrophe is to respect the unity of the Axis powers, which are fair-minded and peace-loving. (Reuters, 28th)

Bulgaria Pessimistic about European Situation

Capital of Bulgaria: The conservative newspaper "Mir" was the first to comment on Hitler's speech, saying that things will now develop along new lines, and even more rapidly. (Reuters, 8th)

Southern Country Pleasantly Surprised and Shocked

Capital of Yugoslavia: Officials here are all expressing their satisfaction because Hitler had mentioned Yugoslavia as a "friendly country". It is said that the dispute between the US President and Hitler has nothing to do with them. Hitler's arrogant wording when mentioning the US President's proposal has left the public with an unpleasant impression. (Reuters, 28th)

Hungary Relieved

Capital of Hungary: The initial reaction of the Hungarian press to Hitler's speech indicates that it is a load off their minds. (Reuters, 28th)

Lithuania Anxious About the Future

Kovno: Lithuanian opinion believes that Hitler's speech has not eased the overall situation, as they feel that the increasingly strained relations between Germany and Poland may cause disturbances in Eastern Europe. (Reuters, 28th)

### Poland in a Distressed Situation, Romania Offers Sympathy

Capital of Romania: German leader Hitler's speech has just been commented on by semi-official figures here, stating that of all the countries that have been threatened, Romania's ally Poland is the worst. Leader Hitler is again using his consistent tactics to try his best to comfort other countries in order to isolate Poland. This is exactly the same as the previous effort to comfort other countries in order to isolate Czechoslovakia. Although Romania was also threatened a few weeks ago (referring to Germany's various economic requests to the country), it is fully sympathetic to Poland's situation. However, given the situation, Romania must expedite negotiations with the relevant countries in order to safeguard its security. It is hoped that Germany will only consider the matter of the cessation of the non-aggression pact in relation to Poland, and will not take any immediate action. (Havas, 28th)

Capital of Romania: It is claimed here that the possible impact of the abrogation of the German-Polish pact will promote the development of Polish-Romanian cooperation. It is rumored that after Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu returns from London, the Balkan Entente countries will soon convene another meeting in Rome, at which the territorial demands put forward by Bulgaria will be discussed. It is expected that the Balkan Entente countries will remain as firmly opposed to territorial changes as before, but may be willing to express their agreement to Bulgaria regarding various plans for economic cooperation. (Reuters, 28th)

Romania Denies Ever Making a Border Request to Germany

Capital of Romania: German leader Hitler said in his speech today that Romania wanted to be contiguous with German territory, and was even willing to include the border area (referring to the Carpathian Ukraine region) under German protection. Responsible figures have denied this claim. Romania does not have this intention. What we are concerned about is that after Hungary's territory has expanded (the Carpathian Ukraine region has been occupied by Hungary), the direct transportation line between Romania and Germany has been cut off. However, we have never ignored the fate of the Carpathian Ukraine and Slovakia regions, and are determined to protect this transportation line. (Havas, 28th)

(Paris) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu met with Commerce Minister Gentin at 10:30 this morning to discuss issues related to the development of trade between France and Romania. (Havas, 28th)

### Chairman of the American Peace Council Advocates Sanctions Against Aggressor Nations, Urges Congress to Take Immediate Steps to Embargo Arms and Loans to Japan

(Washington) Frederick Libby, Chairman of the American Peace and Democracy Union, yesterday urged Congress to embargo arms and loans to Germany, Japan, and Italy. He told the House Foreign Affairs Committee: "If Japan continues to aggress and the United States cannot tolerate it, steps will be taken. We ask that cooperative relations with Japanese aggressors be terminated, and that arms and loan embargoes be placed against the government of that country." Mr. Libby declared: "If America uses its vast wealth for the benefit of peace-loving nations, it can hope to achieve peace." He also said that he does not believe that pointing out aggressor nations is as dangerous as allowing the world to be drawn into war. The Gei Yi Resolution embargoed arms to Japan but could not force Congress to identify aggressor nations. At the same time, California isolationist Republican Senator Johnson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he believed that embargoing arms to a certain country and identifying aggressor nations could lead to war. He said, "We have made efforts in propaganda and have taught the people that we cannot stay out of war. If America does not adopt a neutral stance, it is difficult to hope for peace." (Associated Press, 29th)

Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Arrives in Turkish Capital Yesterday

Capital of Turkey: Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Potemkin, arrived here from the Bulgarian capital at 9:15 this morning. Foreign Minister Saracoğlu welcomed him at the station in person. The station was decorated with the national flags of the Soviet Union and Turkey, and a large crowd cheered and paid their respects to Mr. Potemkin. (Havas, 28th)

Franco-Romanian Talks in All Areas, Views of Both Parties on Relevant Issues are Consistent

(Paris) After Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu held talks with Foreign Minister Bonnet, an official communiqué was issued stating that "all issues related to France and Romania have been submitted for discussion, and the views of both parties are completely consistent, which is very gratifying." (Havas, 29th)

### Britain Preparing to Offer Germany Non-Aggression Guarantees, But Still Not Abandoning Collective Organization, Maisky Returns to His Post to Meet with British Authorities

(London) Well-informed sources today believe that Britain may give Germany a non-aggression guarantee in response to Mr. Hitler's speech, so as to show that Britain does not hate Germany. However, no matter what means the government takes to negotiate with Germany, it will continue its micro-military plans and organize a large-scale European "Peace Front" on the one hand. (Associated Press, 29th)

(London) Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, who returned here yesterday, met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax today. (Reuters, 29th)

Russian Aircraft Flies Directly to New York, Effort Falls Short, Forced to Land Midway, Plane Destroyed But Passengers Safe

Miscou Plains, New Brunswick: The plane piloted by renowned Soviet aviator Kokkinaki and navigator Gordienko was suddenly destroyed at 7 PM yesterday while completing its four-thousand-mile flight, and was forced to land on Miscou Island. Mr. Kokkinaki and Mr. Gordienko are sitting next to the destroyed plane today, waiting for a Boston rescue team to rush to their aid. (Associated Press, 28th)

(New York) Renowned Soviet aviator Kokkinaki, accompanied by his assistant Gordienko, departed from Moscow at 4:15 this morning, piloting the "Moskva" aircraft, attempting to fly non-stop to the United States via Iceland and Greenland.

The aircraft's distress signal has not stopped, indicating that Kokkinaki and Gordienko are both safe. The Soviet Embassy has chartered a Grumman amphibian aircraft to fly to the sea area to rescue them. (Havas, 29th)

### Japan Holds a Meeting in Xinxiang, Seems to Have New Intentions Towards Henan and Shanxi, Fierce Fighting in Areas Along the Tongpu Railway in Shanxi Province, Japan's Three-Pronged Assault on Southeastern Shanxi Fails

(Hong Kong) It is reported by telegram from Chongqing that Commander Sugiyama, the Japanese commander of the North China Expeditionary Army, went to Xinxiang and convened a meeting, which seems to suggest new intentions towards Henan and Shanxi. (Special Dispatch, 30th Morning)

(Chongqing) According to a Chinese source, fierce fighting is currently taking place in the areas along the Tongpu Railway in Shanxi Province, especially on the front line in Linfen. The Japanese army, entrenched in the occupied areas of China, attempted to break through the Chinese army's defenses but failed, suffering considerable casualties. Fierce fighting also took place in the Fushan area. (Associated Press, 27th)

A Certain Location: After invading central Hebei, southern Hebei, and southern Shanxi, the Japanese army invaded southeastern Shanxi on the 24th, attempting to attack the Chinese base areas. They launched a fierce attack simultaneously from three routes: northwest, south, and north, first occupying Fushan Anze, and then capturing Wanghezi Hongnanguan Qikou (south of Jincheng Tianjingguan). Among them, the northern route was the most fierce. The Japanese army, with a division of troops, was personally commanded by Commander Anan, and after occupying Wanghe on the 3rd, they advanced eastward, attacking important locations such as the Shuifengling Nanguan. On the 11th, they fled to Gucheng Shipan, threatening Huawu Xiangyushe. On the northern front, troops in Huima Wangjiapo Yukou and other places, were divided into five routes and headed straight for Zihongkou. A certain Chinese unit was surrounded, but fortunately, the officers and soldiers of the unit fought bravely and managed to break through the encirclement after six days and nights. At the same time, they turned to the rear of the Japanese army to harass them. A certain Chinese unit also divided its troops and marched north to Taigu, causing the Japanese to be exhausted. At present, they have been retreating step by step. Gucheng Quandian Shuifengling Wangtao and other places have no trace of the Japanese army, only relying on the three strongholds of Wanghe Nanguan Zihong to stubbornly resist. (27th Telegram)

Xingji: According to reports, Xu Bingying, the head of the guard battalion of the puppet army unit of Li Ying in Anyang, led 385 officers and soldiers, 231 machine guns, rifles, and pistols, and 57 horses to defect, and killed the Japanese pacification squad leader Tokun Sanlang, assistant consultants, and dozens of puppet army officers. (29th Telegram)

Xingji: The Japanese army in Shanxi has always used rice as its main food. Recently, because of the all-out offensive of the Chinese army and the frequent cutting of the Tongpu Railway, military transportation has been extremely difficult. Therefore, they forcibly took millet, sorghum, flour, etc., from Chinese civilians as food. (29th Telegram)

Xingji: On the evening of the 23rd, Chinese troops approached Pian Guan City, dividing their forces to guard the thoroughfare of Tonghe River, as well as Xiaopiantou (northwest of the city), Hejiayu Gaojiashangshihuiyuan and other places, and used strong units to attack the city gates. On the morning of the 24th, a part of the Japanese army was lured out of the city and was dealt a heavy blow. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was defeated and fled eastward, and hundreds of the remaining Japanese army fell into an encirclement by Chinese forces. At noon on the 25th, a part of the Japanese army broke through to the west and detoured Xiaopiantou, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese army near Yuecheng. (29th Telegram)

Tongguan: On the 217th, the Japanese army in Quwo was reinforced by more than 3,000 from the north. A part of the Japanese army fled into Yicheng. At dawn on the 28th, the Japanese army ordered the remnants of Yicheng to attack a certain Chinese unit with two heavy artillery pieces and six field guns. The Chinese army bravely charged and killed a large number of Japanese troops. In the afternoon, the Chinese army launched a full-scale attack, leaving corpses of Japanese soldiers scattered everywhere as they fled back into the city. (29th Telegram)

### The Three Major Fronts of Military, Political, and Commercial Affairs Creating a New Situation in "Pan-American Diplomacy"

— A Passing Traveler from Huatun

The Air Effect of German and Italian Psychological Strategies (Continued)

Special Correspondence from Our Paris Newspaper

(6) Among the countries of Central and South America, the most difficult to coordinate with the United States is Mexico. Since the Mexican government confiscated foreign property, its feelings towards the United States have been extremely negative. The figures in power there are either extreme left-wing communists or extreme right-wing national socialists, who find it difficult to get along with the United States. The current Mexican government's political tendency leans to the left, similar to the ruling party in Chile. The government is supported by labor unions. On the other hand, those who oppose the ruling party are national socialists who receive assistance from large merchants in Mexico City. In the 1940 presidential election, the national socialists may be elected, but in terms of political nature, they are still not allies of the United States. Currently, the person who is making great efforts to act as a peacemaker between the United States and Mexico is Cuban political authority Colonel Fulgencio Batista. This gentleman arrived in Washington, D.C., last November, and then visited Mexico City, intending to establish a deep foundation of friendship between the United States, Mexico, and Cuba. Furthermore, the labor unions in Mexico City have recently taken the lead in the labor unions of North, Central, and South America. The International Labor Union Conference held in Mexico City last September was attended by more than a dozen countries, including the United States, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Ecuador, Cuba, Chile, and Peru. The United States was represented by the bold and resourceful John L. Lewis, who did his utmost to connect with everyone. As a result, the majority unanimously agreed and proceeded to prepare for the Pan-American Labor Union Congress. The Executive Committee, which will be held prior to the Congress, is scheduled to meet in May this year. This is also an excellent medium for connecting North, Central, and South America as one, and it is sufficient to resolve the discord between the United States and Mexico.

Taixian Communication: The Northern Jiangsu Chinese troops attacking Siyang crossed the river by wading on the night of the 14th and approached the suburbs. They immediately built cloud ladders to climb the city walls. At midnight, a daredevil team rushed into the city and encountered Japanese guards in street fighting. The Japanese troops, awakened from their sleep, responded in a panic, blindly firing machine guns and small cannons. The Chinese troops fought tenaciously. After several hours of fierce fighting, they finally killed dozens of Japanese soldiers. The county seat was temporarily recaptured. At dawn, the Japanese army increased its forces and pressed into the city, bombarding it with artillery fire. The Chinese troops then safely withdrew.

### Japanese Troops Ambushed on the Qing-Hu Highway

Digging Pits to Hide Bombs Achieves Miraculous Results

Qingpu Communication: County Magistrate Yan Fusheng (former Chief of the Seventh District) reported on the 21st that Japanese troops from the Juechuan unit would travel along the Qing-Hu Highway to Qingpu tomorrow morning for reinforcements. Magistrate Gu immediately led the sappers and the Panlong guerrilla team that night, rushing to the Qibao Station on the Qing-Hu Highway and digging a large pit at the base of Bridge No. 16, filling it with hand grenades, and covering it with mud. After the sappers completed their mission, they and the guerrillas ambushed themselves in the Guanyin Temple, waiting for an opportunity to attack. The next day (the 22nd), the Juechuan unit, consisting of more than 300 soldiers, sped westward in trucks. As soon as they passed the Yang Bridge No. 16, there was a loud bang. The first vehicle was completely destroyed, and the second vehicle, unable to stop in time, also fell into the pit. Magistrate Gu immediately led his troops to bombard the Japanese army with hand grenades, killing more than 30 Japanese soldiers.

### Four Japanese Warships Reconnoiter Chaoshan

A Small Number of Japanese Troops Land on Shouyu Island, Christians in Shantou Pray for Victory

Shantou Communication: On the 6th of this month, there were four Japanese warships, two anchored between Zhaoan and Zhelin, one anchored in the North and South Ports of Chenghai, and one anchored near Shenquan in Huilai. A part of the Japanese army landed on Nan'ao, and a small number of Japanese troops landed on Shouyu Island in Haimen Bay. The island has fresh water and fishing huts. Japanese motorboats and electric boats shuttle back and forth outside Mayu Estuary, chasing and looting fishing boats. When the Japanese troops landed on Shouyu Island, the local militia resisted from the trenches and reported to the Chaoyang County Government, requesting reinforcements. Shantou City therefore temporarily spread rumors that the Japanese army had landed in Dahao and Haimen, causing widespread panic. Furthermore, several days ago, a traitor from Xiamen, hired by the Japanese side, secretly arrived in Shantou to scout out military information. He was discovered by the Chinese side and more than a dozen people were arrested. They were all traitors from Taiwan and Xiamen. The Japanese coveting Chaoshan is undeniable. A battle in Chaoshan will eventually break out sooner or later. Christians in Shantou, upon receiving a notice from the National Christian Council, fasted for one day on Good Friday, the 7th of this month, to pray for the victory of the war of resistance and the success of national construction. At 8:00 AM, thousands of fasting believers gathered in the Bethel Church, reverently praying for the victory of the war of resistance and the success of national construction. The Fifth District Commissioner's Office recently convened a meeting to promote the "National Spiritual Mobilization," resolving to issue notices to all counties and cities from the Administrative Commissioner's Office, the Defense Army Political Department, the Chaoshan Party Affairs Supervisory District, the Chao-Mei Garrison District Command, and the Director's Office of the 14th Regiment of the Military Affairs Commission's Inspection Group to earnestly implement it.

### Japanese Troops in Huzhou Transferred and Ambushed

This was discovered by the Chinese army, who ambushed them on the roadside by the troops of Zhu Xi. When the Japanese troops passed by, they were intercepted in the middle. The Japanese troops resisted desperately in a panic, but after being severely attacked by the Chinese, they collapsed in defeat. More than a dozen Japanese officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, and more than a dozen Chinese soldiers were also injured. After suffering this disastrous defeat, the Japanese troops reported to the Japanese regular bureau in Jiaxing. On the 28th, a team of Japanese aircraft from He sent a team of planes to Xinshi Town and the surrounding area for reconnaissance, and then dropped three or four bombs in the urban area and strafed with machine guns. It is estimated that dozens of civilian houses were bombed and destroyed in the town, and more than a dozen innocent residents were killed and countless were injured. After dropping bombs in Xin, the Japanese aircraft flew to Qianjing (a local name, very close to Xinshi, an important pass near the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway) and dropped a bomb, the damage is unknown.

### Japanese Troops in Jinshan Invade Maoqiao

Japanese Lieutenant Killed

Jinshan Communication: The Jinshan Japanese Garrison, led by Japanese Lieutenant Nakao, along with puppet police, invaded the position of the Chinese xxx Brigade in Maoqiao the day before yesterday.

The Chinese troops took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the puppet police were completely annihilated. The remaining Japanese troops fled towards Jinshan, four kilometers south of Maoqiao.

### Stone Quarrying Sites in Western Songjiang All Closed

Nine Hills Not Allowed to Be Quarried, Thousands of Stonemasons Displaced

The Tianma Mountain, Hengshan, Sheshan, Xiaokunshan, Xueshan, Fenghuang Mountain, Gonggong Mountain, Beigan Mountain, Xiaoshan, and other hills in the western Songjiang area have always been quarried by workers hired by various hill owners, and the stones are transported to Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places as building materials. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the National Army has moved west, and all the stone quarrying hills have become guerrilla areas. Last month, the Japanese troops stationed in Songjiang went to the old site of a certain steel factory on Tianma Mountain to collect a large amount of steel. They hired hundreds of Jiangbei workers to transport it in batches over a period of two weeks. After that, the Japanese and puppet troops dispatched a large number of troops to close and occupy all nine hills, not allowing the hill owners to quarry. The daily lives of thousands of stonemasons depend entirely on quarrying. Now they have been displaced. It is heard that after the Japanese side closed the hills, it has now formed a separate quarrying company to extract stone and distribute the profits.

### Traitors in Wuxi Suppress Opium

Every Opium Den Must Sell One Ounce Per Day

Wuxi Communication: Since Wuxi was poisoned by the Japanese puppet's policy, opium dens have sprung up everywhere, and there is a puppet anti-opium bureau responsible for promoting opium sales. However, there are too few smokers, resulting in low opium sales. In March, less than 3,000 ounces were sold. The puppet bureau chief, Xuan Baohua, was very anxious and ordered the puppet inspection and license bureau staff that from the 21st, each opium den must sell a minimum of one ounce of opium per day. Those who do not meet the quota will have their puppet licenses revoked. The opium dens, under this pressure, are facing the prospect of automatically closing down due to the normal level of sales.

### German Steamer "Wang Bao" Seized by Japanese Warship

The Steamer Travels the Ningbo-Dinghai Line, its Whereabouts Unknown After Seizure

Ningbo Communication: After the German Far East Company's Tianbao Steamer, which travels the Ningbo-Dinghai line, was approved to resume sailing, it sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai at 10:00 AM on the 26th, carrying 147 pieces of cargo such as cloth, hemp, and bamboo shoots, and four or fifty passengers. Unexpectedly, at 1:00 PM that afternoon, when it was sailing between Ligang and Luotoumen, it was suddenly intercepted by a Japanese warship and forced to sail away with it. The whereabouts of the steamer are currently unknown. All the passengers on board were detained on the ship. It was found that the German shipowner, Erhard Siebert, had recently taken the Hana Steamer from Dinghai to Shanghai for recuperation. There were no other foreign crew members, so he was unable to immediately negotiate with the Japanese warship when it was seized.

### Xinghua Organizes a Committee to Inspect Japanese Goods

Register by Deadline or Confiscate

Xinghua Communication: The county government believes that recently there have been frequent cases of unscrupulous merchants selling Japanese goods, hoping to profit from them. In order to identify Japanese goods, a committee to inspect Japanese goods was organized at the county government conference at 3:00 PM on the 18th of this month, bringing together the county chamber of commerce, the county party department, the Beijing-Guangzhou goods guild, the cloth guild, the south goods guild, the county police assistant, the technical chief, and the chiefs of various districts. After deliberation, it was decided that all attending agencies and organizations would be members, with County Magistrate Qi as the chairman and County Party Secretary Chen as the vice-chairman. It was also resolved that all merchants must register their existing Japanese goods within a specified period, otherwise they will all be confiscated.

### Sanmen Bay's Market Suddenly Booming

Merchants and Customers Come to Buy Goods

Ningbo Communication: Since the mouth of the Yong River was ordered to be blockaded, the source of goods has been cut off, and inland prices have gradually risen. Now, sailing ships from Taiwan are coming and going to Shanghai in Sanmen Bay's Haiyou Town, transporting goods. Merchants from all over the country have come to the area to purchase goods. Sanmen Bay's commerce has suddenly boomed.

### Twists and Turns in the Reorganization of the First Regiment of the Jiangsu Security Force

The First Infantry Regiment of the Third District Security Force of Jiangsu Province is stationed in the Jiading, Taicang, and Baoshan areas. Recently, it received an order from the Shanghai Military Commissioner of the Third War Area to expand into the First Route Command of the Shanghai People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps, and appointed Deng Jinglie, the regiment commander of the regiment, as the commander, Xu Jihui, the deputy regiment commander of the regiment, as the chief of staff, Tan Siyuan, the battalion commander of the first battalion of the regiment, as the commander of the first detachment, and Zhu Weiren, the battalion commander of the second battalion of the regiment, as the commander of the second detachment. After receiving the order, the regiment was preparing to reorganize, but a few dismissed officers and soldiers fabricated rumors out of resentment, saying that the regiment's reorganization into a self-defense corps meant that it belonged to the puppet-organized county self-defense corps, and secretly distributed leaflets in an attempt to slander it. There are suspicions that they have received bribes from others as counter-espionage propaganda, and it is being thoroughly investigated. Regiment Commander Deng Jinglie and others, feeling unjustly accused, jointly convened a high-level military meeting with Jiading County Magistrate Lu Linxun to discuss reorganization methods. They all agreed that the rumors were unfounded and stemmed from confusion over the name of the self-defense corps. In addition to thoroughly investigating the traitors and punishing them according to the law, they also requested their superiors to preserve the original name of the security regiment.

### Zhu Ji Concurrently Serves as the Magistrate of Jingjiang County

Local People Rejoice at Getting the Right Person

Jingjiang Communication: Jingjiang is located on the banks of the Yangtze River, facing Jiangyin across the river. Since the Chinese army abandoned Chengxi, Jingjiang also fell into enemy hands. However, the Japanese army only occupied the urban area, and the remaining towns are still under the jurisdiction of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. All administrative matters are carried out as usual in accordance with the orders of the central government. Currently, the Jiangsu provincial authorities, considering that the county is strategically important, have specially appointed Zhu Ji, the commander of the Fourth Brigade of the Provincial Security Force, as the concurrent county magistrate of the county. The original county magistrate, Han Tong, has completed the handover. It is heard that after Zhu Brigade Commander took office, he has spared no effort in appeasing the local people and is strictly enforcing the law against drug traffickers and opium addicts. Zhu is originally from Jingjiang and a graduate of Baoding Military Academy. After August 13th, he organized the People's Self-Defense Force, was brave and good at fighting, and was highly valued by his superiors. This appointment to concurrently administer his hometown's political affairs is celebrated by the local people.

### Japanese Arrest Chinese Patriotic Volunteers

A Total of Thirteen People Arrested

Japanese Lines Are Densely Deployed, Setting Traps

Since Xiong Jiantong, commander of the guerrilla forces in the six counties of Qin, Jia, Tai, Kun, Qing, and Song, was lured and arrested by the Japanese, his secretary, Zhou Yuwen, and six others, including Luo Zhenqing, have also been arrested in Shanghai. The details of the process have been reported in newspapers. It is now known that the Japanese side publicly announced yesterday that they have recently arrested activists from various Chinese guerrilla forces in Shanghai one after another. The number of Chinese patriotic volunteers arrested is as many as thirteen, and they are all key figures in Shanghai.

Shen Hengyi and Others Arrested One After Another

According to the Japanese side, on the morning of the 26th of last month, Shen Hengyi, a staff officer of the general headquarters of the Zhejiang National Anti-Enemy Self-Defense Corps, and Shen's key members, Kong Qingzeng and Yang Ru, were arrested in western Shanghai. The same methods used on Xiong Jiantong were used on Shen and others. When Shen was arrested, local newspapers in Shanghai published news of the incident, but it was brief and not detailed. At that time, it was impossible to obtain the details.

Xiong's Subordinates Also Detained

Before this case occurred, after Xiong Jiantong was arrested, according to Japanese propaganda, during this period, the Japanese military police were dispatched to find that Xiong's subordinate, Wu Bocheng, had rented the premises at 631 Myburgh Road and opened a shop as a communication point. Wu was arrested by the Japanese side, and then Guo Zhixiang and Zhang Shufan, the Bao Ying natives who were the wireless communication officers of Xiong's unit, were arrested at Room 719 on the seventh floor of the Yangzi Hotel. The dates of the arrest of Wu, Guo, and Zhang were the 13th and 14th of March.

Chongming Detachment Leader Arrested in Shanghai

Until the morning of the 26th of last month, Chen Chaozu (43 years old), a native of Chongming, was arrested at the Bund Garden Pier on a civilian boat in the Huangpu River by Japanese police officers and [name missing] City Officer Ichikawa. According to the Japanese announcement, Chen was the leader of the Chongming Detachment of the Jiang-Zhe Guerrilla Force, and his troops had five machine guns and more than 500 rifles. His strength was very strong, and he had fought many battles with the Japanese army. He was regarded as a confidant's problem. Chen often came to Shanghai to purchase military supplies. The Japanese had long received information from traitors, so they sent Captain Tsuda of the Military Police to be responsible for the investigation. Until that day, the Japanese learned that Chen was carrying military supplies and many of his subordinates, disguised, had boarded a civilian boat on the Bund, intending to return to his base in Chongming. So they rushed to the scene and arrested Chen and his squadron leader Shen Hao, squad leader Wu Bingsun, secretary and liaison officer for the Chongming Anti-Japanese Primary School in Wusong, Lu Cuoning, Xu Yincheng, and recruiting officer Zhu Wenhua, a total of six people.

Claiming to Have Two Bases

Detailed news about this was published yesterday in a very prominent position in local Japanese newspapers in Shanghai. It seems that these Chinese patriotic figures, who have been formally announced by the Japanese side, are still being held in a certain place in Hongkou, and there is no danger to their lives.

Besides reporting the disaster caused by the Japanese bombing, it also stated that Ling Bridge was destroyed. However, yesterday evening's news reported that Ling Bridge remained intact as usual and was not affected. After much inquiry, it was learned that Ling Bridge was indeed hit by a bomb when Japanese planes dropped bombs, but because the explosive force was not great and the bridge was sturdily built, the road surface suffered only slight damage. Currently, the authorities are making every effort to comfort and assist the affected households and stabilize public morale, so order has already been restored.

Ningbo Chamber of Commerce Telegram Requests Relief

Datong News Agency reports that Zhou Dalie, Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, sent a special telegram yesterday to the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai, which reads, "Respectfully, to Elder Yu Qiaqing and gentlemen of the Native Association, forwarded by Brother Mei Xian (Zhu Meixian, Manager of the Ningbo Shaoxing Company). On the day before yesterday, Japanese planes bombed Ningbo, destroying Ling Bridge and burning over a thousand houses. Casualties are heavy, shops are closed, and people have fled. Ningbo has become a dead city. You are concerned about your hometown, and how should we provide relief to the refugees? Please take immediate measures to alleviate the suffering of the survivors. Awaiting your reply. Zhou Dalie, Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, bows respectfully." After the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai received the above telegram, they immediately replied, "Respectfully to the Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce. We have received your telegram. We are deeply concerned about the disaster in our hometown. We will immediately convene a meeting to discuss relief measures. We will inform you in advance and look forward to your detailed telegrams at any time. Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai bows respectfully."

Air Raid Alarm Yesterday Without Surprise Attack. Ningbo sounded an air raid alarm again at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The atmosphere was extremely tense, but the Japanese planes did not enter the area. The alarm was lifted at noon. In general, order in Ningbo is stable.

### Public Donations Must Not Be Misappropriated

He has specially telegraphed all levels of party headquarters across the country, stating that all donated funds received should be reported and remitted to the national treasury at any time. It is absolutely forbidden to store or misappropriate them for any reason. Otherwise, strict punishment will be imposed upon discovery to maintain party discipline.

### Shanghai Financial Stability: All Industries Safely Pass the Quarter-End

Money Dealers Association Announces Interbank Rate

Banks and Firms Will Allow Flexibility for Maturing Loans

Today is the quarter-end settlement period for Shanghai's industry and commerce. The Money Dealers Association has announced the interbank interest rate. Banks and firms will allow flexibility in extending the terms of maturing long-term credit loans to the tenth day of the month and will grant new loans to manufacturers and merchants dealing in national goods. The financial market remains stable, and all industries are safe and sound. Details are recorded below:

Interbank Rate Discussion

The Money Dealers Association convened a quarter-end interbank rate meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the 25th of this month. Managers Xi Jiming, Zhang Mengzhou, Yan Dayou, Shen Jingliang, Pei Yunqing, Xu Wenqing, and others from Fuyuan, Shunkang, Shifeng, Wufeng, Tongrun, Hongsheng, Huifeng, Cunde, and other firms attended. The meeting decided on an interbank rate of 5.5 yuan. The announcement is recorded below: "To whom it may concern, the interbank interest rate for this quarter, as decided at the interbank rate meeting convened on the 25th of this month, is 5.5 yuan. We hereby inform you for your reference."

Quarter-End Arrived

A Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned yesterday from silver and money dealers that fixed-term credit loans in the Shanghai market are mostly limited to six months, called "six pairs," meaning six matching months. For example, every quarter-end and the tenth day of the month are the beginning and end periods, or called "long-term forties," because the peak season for commerce and goods throughout the year is after those two months. If funds are needed for the new goods that appear on the market in May or June, they are made in advance at the end of April. If funds are needed to handle cross-year goods in November or at the end of the year, they must be made in advance at the end of October. This year's quarter-end has arrived.

National Goods Loans

Money dealers have already added to the "interbank" interest rate and made their own decisions based on the availability of funds. This year, credit and long-term loans have been granted as much as possible to factories and firms dealing in national goods. The interest rate is directly negotiated by each firm and each firm to support the development of national goods businesses. However, purchase loans for spring cocoons, new tea, rapeseed, wheat, etc. in the occupied areas are all rejected. Those outside the occupied areas are still granted loans on a discretionary basis.

Maturing Loans

Although the exact amount of credit loans maturing this quarter-end cannot be verified, it is estimated to be 40 to 50 million yuan. Money dealers account for 80 to 90 percent, and banks account for only 10 to 20 percent. Because the business of money dealers is mainly based on credit loans, money dealers are now allowing reliable firms to extend the terms to the end of October, but interest must be paid off. Separate new loan contracts are signed. The above extension procedures are handled separately by each firm and are completed before today.

All Industries Safely Pass

After the war, all firms implemented contraction and increased reserves in accordance with the financial measures set by the Ministry, and benefited from the adjustments of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, as well as the effects of the remittance and bill system. Therefore, Shanghai's financial market remains stable as usual. Various interest rates have rarely changed. The bankruptcy of banks and money dealers has not occurred at all, which is very different from the quarter-ends of past years. There is no shortage of funds. All industries have developed abnormally after the war and can safely pass this quarter-end, which is better than before the war.

### American Ten-Thousand-Ton Cruiser Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning

Crew Members Go Ashore to View the War Ruins in Zhabei. The Ship is Scheduled to Leave Shanghai at Noon Tomorrow.

Flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet Also Arrived in Port Yesterday

Dalu Bao reports that the American ten-thousand-ton cruiser Astoria, which carried the ashes of former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito back to Japan, was scheduled to dock outside Wusong last night (28th) and enter the port around 8:00 a.m. this morning (29th), docking at the fourth and fifth buoys, where Japanese ships often dock. It was originally scheduled to stay in Shanghai for a week and then sail to Hong Kong and Manila, but unconfirmed sources say it will only dock for one day. As of late last night, the captain of the Astoria had not notified local authorities of his plans in Shanghai, so it is not known for sure whether it

will stay in Shanghai for one day or one week. Naval circles in this port believe that the original plan will not change because the crew will not have time to go ashore for a tour in one day, and it is said that the ship will add some items in this port, which will take more than 24 hours. Also, the flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, the Augusta, sailed from Manila and is scheduled to arrive at Wusong before dawn today. It will arrive in port before the Astoria and dock at the naval buoy in front of the Customs Pier, staying in Shanghai for one month and then sailing to North China for patrol. Destroyers and submarines of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet will arrive in Shanghai for temporary docking starting in late May,

and then sail to Qingdao and Yantai for patrol. Also, the English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports that the American cruiser Astoria, by order of President Roosevelt, sailed from Yokohama after carrying the ashes of former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito back to Japan and arrived in Shanghai just after 8:00 a.m. this morning (29th), docking at the third and fourth buoys in the Huangpu River. It was originally scheduled to stay in Shanghai for five days, but it has now been changed to about forty-eight hours. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai around noon on Monday. The Naval Youth Association has obtained permission from the Japanese military authorities to

arrange for crew members of the ship to visit the Zhabei district, which was destroyed by gunfire. The first group is scheduled to depart at 1:30 p.m. today, and the second group is scheduled to depart at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. The flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, the Augusta, also arrived in Shanghai around 8:00 a.m. this morning, docking at the buoy opposite the Customs Pier.

### Zhejiang Customs Resumes Business: Ramie Fabric Exemption

Release Upon Presentation of Foreign Exchange Certificate

Regarding the shipment of ramie fabric to Shanghai, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Customs Commissioner of Zhejiang Customs to inquire whether they had been ordered to release the goods. They received a reply yesterday stating, "Your telegram is noted. This Customs has received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance ordering that ramie fabric be exempted from the ban on transportation. In the future, ramie fabric exports can be released upon presentation and verification of the foreign exchange purchase certificate."

### May Day Tomorrow

Labor Groups Encourage Workers

Strive for Wartime Production

Tomorrow is May Day, Labor Day. Factory workers in this city will take a holiday to commemorate it as usual. Labor groups believe that in this extraordinary time, they do not intend to lead workers in extravagant commemorative ceremonies, but will encourage workers to recognize their wartime mission, uphold the spirit of labor-management coordination, and strive for wartime production to increase the strength of the war effort and strive for final victory.

### Japanese Merchants Exploit Inland River Shipping: General Strike Imminent

Boatmen from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Take United Action. Lighterage Industry Joins the Resistance Due to Intolerable Exploitation.

Since the Japanese-owned Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company at No. 434 North Suzhou Road monopolized inland river shipping, all cargo transportation routes have been monopolized, causing private boats to be unable to operate and livelihoods to be difficult. Therefore, various groups are opposing this and will jointly launch a general strike to show resistance. Details are recorded as follows:

Japanese and Puppet Monopoly of Inland River Transport

The Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company is the general mechanism controlled by the Japanese Qing Shipping Company for inland river transportation. Zheng Wenguang and Li Kunhe serve as "managers" and "business directors." The routes it has opened include Beixinjing (including Hongqiao), Minhang, Yexie, Hupu, Changshu, Huzhou, Xinwuku, Xitang, Fengjing, Songjiang, Wuxi (via Suzhou), and other routes. In addition to passengers, all cargo is transported with a "procurement permit" issued by the Japanese puppets, which is contracted by the company. Private boats without permission are not allowed to undertake cargo transportation. At the same time, they arbitrarily raise freight rates and extort shippers to the extreme. The remuneration for the cargo ships they hire is transferred and exploited by Japanese puppet personnel, and the proceeds are very small. Sometimes they are swallowed up entirely, with nothing left. All boatmen cry out in agony.

Livelihood Difficulties for Private Shipping in Various Regions

Since the affairs of inland river transportation have been controlled by the Japanese puppets, private boats in various regions, which relied on transporting cargo for customers or small-scale trade, have been greatly affected. The impact on rice boats, gravel boats, firewood boats, vegetable boats, manure boats, oil boats, etc., which usually make a living from trade, is very large. Although boatmen have "passes" issued by the Japanese puppet "agencies" stationed in each area, they still cannot load cargo without a "procurement permit." In the past, some private boats, unaware of the situation, undertook passenger and cargo transportation, but after being discovered by the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company, they were reported to the local Japanese army, so boatmen did not dare to solicit cargo and shippers did not dare to entrust transportation. The livelihoods of boatmen are completely cut off, and the situation is very tragic.

Joint Barge Resistance

Private boats in various regions, under the pressure of Japanese puppet coercion, have no way to appeal. To concentrate their forces and express their firm resistance, private boats from Wuxi, Changshu, Songjiang, and other groups first organized a federation and actively promoted it. Boatmen from Zhejiang Province, such as Pinghu, Wuxing, Jiashan, Zhangyan, and Fengjing, have also joined one after another. At the same time, the sand barge boatmen employed by the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company have also suffered deeply from the exploitation of the Japanese puppets and have felt pain. Therefore, they intend to take united action with private boats from various groups and may launch a general strike to show resistance.

### Zhou Bangjun Appointed to Film Censorship Committee

Mr. Zhou Bangjun

### Commodity Exhibition Opening Soon

More Than Twenty Manufacturers Have Participated

The Shanghai National Products Manufacturers United Association is sponsoring the Shanghai Commodity Exhibition to promote national goods and encourage production. It is scheduled to open on May 18 and will last for three weeks. It is sponsored by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and participation from factories is extremely enthusiastic.

Chamber of Commerce Sponsorship

The association received a letter from the Chamber of Commerce yesterday stating, "In reply, we have received your letter requesting us to announce to all manufacturers in the city to actively participate in the Shanghai Commodity Exhibition, which you are preparing. This is sufficient to show your association's enthusiasm for national goods and your tireless efforts, which we admire very much. Our association has already sent letters to various trade associations, ordering them to notify the national goods factories under their jurisdiction to actively participate. The opening of the exhibition is imminent. The manufacturers that have already participated are as follows: Yinfeng Wool Weaving and Dyeing Factory, Kangfu Hongji Weaving Factory, Lun Sheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, China Button Factory, China Industrial Factory, Huacheng Weaving Factory, Pingan Industrial Factory, Huachang Enji Ink Factory, Dafeng Cotton Weaving and Dyeing Factory, Tiangong Velvet Carpet Factory, Daxin Chemical Factory, Hefeng Enterprise Company Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Industrial and Commercial Battery Factory, Tianran Fresh Seasoning Factory, Jiuzhitang Pharmacy, Jingan Chemical Industrial Society, Xinsheng Yarn Factory, Da Shanghai Rubber Factory, Yaohua Peppermint Factory, Yongxin Company, Huaou Sugar Factory, Yaochang Thread Factory, Shengyang Brothers Mirror Factory, Huafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, French Chinese Pharmacy, National Canvas Factory, Anli Electric Appliance Factory."

### Representatives of Tenants in Qingyu Lane Petitioned the Chinese Directors Yesterday

Tenants of Qingyu Lane on New Chongqing Road and Chengdu Road in this city are in panic because the Women's Bank has ordered them to move out within a limited time for reconstruction. Yesterday, they sent representatives Qian Huafo and others to petition Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, Guo Shun, and five Chinese directors, requesting assistance.

### Japanese Are Preparing a Cotton Industry Exchange to Manipulate Yarn Prices

The Site Is the Old Site of the Gold Exchange

The cotton yarn exchange initiated by the Japanese side has been brewing for a long time, but it has not been realized because those engaged in yarn and cloth transactions are afraid of being noticed. However, the Japanese side is still actively preparing, and has already found the old site of the Gold Exchange next to the East Citibank on Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road as the site. The deposit for brokers is set at 3,000 yuan, and the transaction unit is 10 bales. It is scheduled to start on May 1. The standard brands are internally designated as the Blue Weft brand of the Japanese Chinese Yarn Factory and the Water Moon brand of Neiwai, intending to monopolize the market and manipulate yarn prices. The sign "Shanghai Cotton Industry Exchange Founding Office, Joint Stock Company" is hung in front of the old site of the Gold Exchange, and construction is underway inside.

### The Japanese Army on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Is Weak: Using Rubber Men as Soldiers

Equipping Military Vehicles for Shuttle Patrols

Attempting to Confuse the Sight of the Chinese Army

Recently, the Chinese guerrillas on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways have been unusually active, while the Japanese army has been transferring troops to reinforce the front line due to the tense military situation, resulting in a weak rear defense. The Chinese army took the opportunity to attack and inflicted heavy damage. According to a visitor from Suzhou yesterday, the Japanese army in the inland area has recently been short of troops and unable to recruit more. However, to create a false impression and intimidate the Chinese, they came up with an outlandish idea of preparing hundreds of rubber figures, dressing them in yellow military uniforms, and equipping them with forged firearms. Their heads can also be rotated, and from a distance, they are almost indistinguishable from real people. The rubber figures are all loaded on military vehicles, escorted by four Japanese soldiers. Every evening, they shuttle back and forth between Wuxi, Suzhou, and other stations, staging their old trick of an empty city to show that the Japanese army has sufficient troops, in an attempt to confuse the sight of the Chinese army. At first, the Chinese army also believed it to be true, but now they have exposed it. Therefore, whenever they discover rubber figure vehicles, they attack them. The Japanese side's efforts are futile and ridiculous.

### Japanese Army in Nantong Suffers Two Defeats

Women Found Among Reinforcements. Replenishment of Japanese Soldiers Becomes a Problem.

Reliable news from Nantong yesterday stated that before dawn on the 17th of this month, the Chen Caifu unit of the Chinese guerrillas in that area had once again surrounded and attacked the Japanese army. Although the number of Japanese troops stationed in Nantong at that time was large, they were caught off guard, so they were caught unprepared and fought in a hurry, suffering heavy casualties. The number of Japanese officers killed was as high as thirty, which is sufficient to show the intensity of the fierce battle between the two sides in this battle. In addition, the Japanese army's supplies were also severely damaged. Finally, after the rear support was cut off, the Chen unit

drove the Japanese army out of the suburbs. After suffering this blow, the Japanese army felt extremely humiliated and called for help everywhere, eagerly seeking revenge. Finally, on the 20th, they received 200 reinforcements, and before dawn on the 21st, together with the previous remnants, they took seven small motorboats and landed on the Jiang shore around Nantong to make a joint encirclement counterattack. However, the Chen unit had already received the news and had safely withdrawn in advance and dispersed in the suburbs. Therefore, when the Japanese army gradually approached, the Chen unit had already surrounded them again behind the Japanese army. By the time the Japanese army realized it and hurriedly looked back, they were still

trapped by the Chen unit and suffered dozens of casualties. After the Chen unit completed the mission, they disappeared in a certain direction. The Japanese army, unable to vent their anger after these two losses, resorted to their usual trick and conducted a large-scale search in the villages, but found nothing. Therefore, they slaughtered innocent people in the surrounding villages at will, and the number of victims was countless. Corpses were piled up in wheat fields, which was too horrible to look at. However, there was one thing afterwards that

was worthy of attention, that is, women were found among the Japanese reinforcements this time. All their temples had been cut off, and their clothing was the same as soldiers. Many of them had been killed by the Chen unit, and the Japanese army did not have time to remove them, so they were discovered. Therefore, it is sufficient to show that the Japanese army has become a problem for rear support replenishment, and that there are indeed no soldiers to transfer from their country, causing a labor shortage.

### The Standardization Problem of Our Country's Seasoning Powder

Written by Zhou Dingyi, Manager of Standard Machine-Made Seasoning Powder Factory

Mr. Zhou Dingyi, manager of the Standard Machine-Made Seasoning Powder Factory in this city, in view of the general errors of domestic seasoning powder, wrote an article entitled "The Standardization Problem of Seasoning Powder in Our Country," which briefly stated, "Seasoning powder has only been in our country for more than ten years. Before the August 13th Incident, there were about a dozen factories manufacturing it. As of now, the number of factories has doubled compared to before the war, but it still contains a major problem, that is, due to the white-hot competition in sales prices, the quality varies. The largest market for seasoning powder is currently the South Seas Islands. If the quality is poor, it will give overseas Chinese a bad impression. I have studied the food and beverage laws of various countries in the world and have concluded that the most prohibited examples are adulterants, especially the laws of various states in the United States. To talk about the standard of seasoning powder, we must first have a definition of seasoning powder, that is, 'Seasoning powder is a product rich in sodium glutamate, which must contain a small amount of sodium chloride (table salt).' This is a more reasonable definition. According to this, standard seasoning powder must not contain other adulterants except table salt. Therefore, we can have the following standard ingredients: (Grade A Seasoning Powder Standard) Sodium glutamate content must not be less than 85%, and salt content must not be more than 5%. But in fact, due to the general consideration that customers prefer more salty seasoning powder with more stimulating taste, there should be Grade B standards stipulated, (Grade B Seasoning Powder Standard) Sodium glutamate content should not be less than 70%, and salt content should not be more than 20%. If you follow the above-mentioned Grade A and B ingredients, it is impossible to mix other adulterants (because the water of crystallization accounts for one molecular weight of sodium glutamate). A report published in the Osaka Brewing Journal in 1935 analyzed the seasoning powder on the market, and the results showed that the best quality grade A standard, the sodium glutamate content calculated anhydrously, reached 99%. Looking back at our country, it is getting worse and worse. The worst sodium glutamate is only 16% (according to my recent unpublished chemical test results). The adulterant is nearly 60% other than salt. This suicide policy is enough to destroy its existing market. We hope that overseas Chinese will launch their patriotism to buy national goods, but manufacturers bear a very important responsibility for the degradation of quality, and it is urgent to have the fact of ‘standardizing seasoning powder’ to dedicate to the market, then the future of seasoning powder is very fortunate, and the future of national goods is very fortunate. Since the new "Jiuweiyi" and "Xianda Wang" two kinds of seasoning powder came out, Fortunately, I have been praised by all walks of life, and I have not failed the mission of our factory. This is enough to comfort myself and can tell all walks of life."

### After the Tianbao Wheel Was Detained, German Merchants Negotiated with the Japanese

At the Same Time, Report to the German Consul in Shanghai

After the Ningbo Defense Command approved the resumption of navigation between Ningbo and Dinghai, the Tianbao Wheel of the German firm Schiess de Hoyer, sailed from Yong to Dinghai on the 26th of this month, taking the lead in resuming navigation. In the waters of Luotoumen, it was suddenly detained by a Japanese warship and forced to sail to Shanghai. It is now docked at the Wusongkou, under the supervision of the Japanese army, and forced to fly the Japanese flag. After receiving the report, the firm, in addition to reporting to the German Consul General in Shanghai to negotiate with the Japanese, also sent the head of the firm to the Japanese Naval Command at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to request its speedy release and present evidence to prove that it was German-owned, but to no avail.

### Rice Industry to Calibrate Measures This Morning

The Stagnation Has Been Going on for Too Long and Needs to Be Corrected. It Will Be Held at the Grain Exchange.

The calibration of measures in the rice industry in this city was originally scheduled to be held twice a year in spring and autumn. Since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai in the past year, the Nanshi and Zhabei have fallen into the war zone, and more old measures have been lost in various firms. In addition, the calibration of measures has been stagnant for too long. To correct the malpractices of the industry, the Soy and Rice Trade Association has notified the Nanbang Guild, the Changshu Rice Industry Guild, and other groups to hold a meeting calibration at 9:00 a.m. today on the second floor of the Aiduoya Bund Grain Exchange.

### Japanese Soldiers Check Epidemic Prevention Certificates at the Garden Bridge

Stricter with Chinese, No Accidents Occurred

The "North China Daily News" reports that yesterday (the 28th), Japanese sentries at the Garden Bridge demanded to see vaccination certificates from Chinese entering Hongkew, but foreigners were not interfered with. Most Chinese crossing the bridge had such certificates. Those who did not were asked to stand aside and wait for a Japanese military doctor to administer the vaccination. Some who did not have certificates and did not want to be vaccinated returned to the south bank of Suzhou Creek. The Japanese sentries and police from the Japanese Consulate General were not very strict in checking certificates. As of late last night, no accidents had been reported as a result of the certificate checks.

### Two British Men and Women Detained by Japanese Troops for Five Hours

Released after being forced to sign a confession for riding together after curfew

The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that Mr. Hayes, a British physical education teacher at a church school, and his girlfriend, Miss Prynne, were detained by the Japanese military authorities for five hours last night (the 28th) after curfew. This morning (the 29th), he recounted the experience to reporters, saying that last night the two were riding horses along the Great West Road railway line when they were stopped by a Japanese sentry. However, at that time, there was a sentry box on one side and a barbed wire fence on the other, making it inconvenient to turn the horses around. Therefore, they continued forward, handed the horses

to a groom, and then returned. They were opposed by the sentry. This morning, a Japanese newspaper claimed that they only returned after being stopped by a British sentry, which is not true. He and Miss Prynne waited in front of the sentry post for three quarters of an hour. Then, a Japanese officer arrived, who was quite amiable, but treated Miss Prynne

somewhat rudely. Then, they were taken to the Japanese military headquarters on Lincoln Road. Another Japanese officer treated them well and offered them biscuits and cigarettes. Finally, a telephone call was made to the Jing'an Temple Road police station, and a car was summoned to take them back, which was already around 1:00 AM. Before leaving, they had to sign a statement stating that their outing after curfew was a mistake.

### Police Inspect Special Constables

He took the opportunity to present long-service medals to nine individuals, including Police Sergeant Gaulton, and gave an encouraging speech before dismissing the squad.

### Youths, Posing as Patriotic Organizations, Warn Businesses Selling Inferior Goods

Threatening with guns, they committed extortion.

The case is serious and requires further investigation and verification.

Yin A'gen, Chen Yonggui, Gao Yong'an, Shan Zhaoxian and other detectives from the Lao Zha Police Station uncovered a scheme at the Grand Hotel and other locations, where individuals, under the guise of the "Young Men's Anti-Treachery Corps" and the "National Salvation Youth Service Society," were extorting money from businesses dealing in Japanese goods such as woolens, dyes, and hardware. They arrested Huang Xin, Liu Fuqiu, Huang Chuanwen, Hua Minxiang, Zhang Ronggao, Zhang Caiyi, Jiang Bofang, Fei Guishun, Jin Huiquan, and a woman named Lu Cuiying, and confiscated a handgun, as well as counterfeit badges and armbands from the aforementioned two organizations.

Crime One

It was discovered that these individuals had extorted money from (1) the Gongtai Woolen Shop on Fuzhou Road, (2) the Chenxinda Dye Shop on Guangdong Road, (3) the Qingshun Cotton Cloth Shop on Ningbo Road, (4) the Renchang Woolen Shop on Tianjin Road, (5) the Huacheng Cotton Cloth Shop on Beijing Road, (6) the Rongtai Woolen Shop on Ningbo Road, and (7) the Caihongji Hardware Shop on Ningbo Road, totaling several thousand yuan. Huang and the others, upon discovering that a business was selling Japanese goods, would go to the business under the pretense of investigating enemy goods and extort money. If the business resisted, they would threaten them with a gun until their demands were met.

Crime Two

These individuals also committed similar crimes six times in the French Concession: (1) the Baida Cotton Weaving Factory at No. 1, Lane 115, Route Conty, was defrauded of 1,000 yuan, (2) the Changji Woolen Shop at No. 15, Lane 389, Avenue de la Gare, was defrauded of 1,300 yuan, (3) the Gonghelai Dye Shop at No. 1, Lane 29, Rue Massenet, was defrauded of 1,200 yuan, (4) the Gongyu Woolen Shop at No. 274, Avenue de la Republique, was defrauded of 140 yuan, (5) the Fuxin Yarn Shop at No. 17, Yuqing Lane, Rue des Soeurs, was defrauded of 500 yuan, and (6) the Hualun Elastic Band Factory at No. _ Lane 19, Ningbo Road, was defrauded of 200 yuan, totaling over 4,000 yuan. There are likely many more cases that have not been discovered.

Stern Punishment Requested

Therefore, the total amount of money and goods defrauded by Huang and the others is estimated to be over ten thousand yuan. The case has been handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Judge Feng Shide convened a criminal court yesterday afternoon to question the defendants. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Le Junwei to defend them. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi vehemently criticized the defendants for engaging in extortion under the guise of patriotic organizations, which has left a negative impression on the public. He requested the court to impose a severe sentence according to the law, so that those who would follow their example would be deterred.

Defendant's Testimony

During the court's questioning, the defendant Zhang Caiyi and others claimed that when they discovered that a business was selling enemy goods, they would go to investigate. If it was confirmed, they would issue a warning. The money given by the businesses was entirely voluntary as donations for expenses. They never engaged in any acts of intimidation. The purpose of carrying a handgun was because businesses dealing in enemy goods inevitably interacted with enemies, so it was used for self-defense in case of conflict with enemies, and not as a tool for intimidation or extortion. They claimed that they had investigated hundreds of businesses, and if a business did not have any enemy goods, they would refuse to accept money even if offered. Judge Feng, after reviewing the testimony, ruled that the case required further investigation and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.

Victim Stabbed More Than Thirty Times, Gruesome Sight

At 10:45 PM the night before last, three thugs forced open the back door and entered. They first tied up the apprentice Jiang Haoqing who opened the back door, and one thug guarded him while the other two thugs rushed into the counter area. They repeatedly stabbed the shop's accountant, Tang Shenglin (28 years old, from Dongting), in the head,

killing him on the spot.

They then robbed over 100 yuan in cash, a gold ring, and several items of clothing and fled. Afterwards, shop assistant Wang Yuanmao returned to the shop from outside and discovered the situation. He untied Jiang and reported the case to the French Police, who dispatched detectives to investigate and sent Sheng's body to the Tongren Fuyuan sub-hall to await autopsy. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. This publication has learned that French police detectives, based on the statement of the shop apprentice Jiang Haoqing during the investigation, immediately set out to arrest the suspects that night. They

arrested Ye Chunian

(21 years old, from Dongting Mountain), who used to work in the pawnshop business but is now unemployed and homeless. He was taken back to the police station for questioning. He confessed that he went with the two fugitives, Ye Sizhong and Zhou Jie. Detectives also found a cleaver, a small file, and an iron rod inside the shop after the incident. It was also heard that the murderers' clothes were stained with blood during the crime, so they took off their clothes and put on the pawnshop's unredeemed clothes and fled. The detectives took the murder weapons and

bloody clothes to the case.

Yesterday morning, the police dispatched a Western officer to the autopsy room to take detailed photos and drawings of the wounds on the body for evidence. According to reports from the French Police to Judge Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court yesterday, along with a forensic doctor and clerk, they arrived at the scene to examine the body. The head and both cheeks were repeatedly stabbed nearly twenty times, making it a bloody mess and unbearable to witness. The chest was stabbed more than ten times with the file. Both hands were cut several times while trying to stop the attacks, and one section of the right index finger was cut off. After the examination,

the case was brought before the court.

The detectives first reported the details of the case and presented the murder weapons. The arrested suspect, Ye Chunian, was brought in to await questioning. The deceased's cousin, Tang Zhilin, arrived on behalf of the family and said that the deceased's wife and children were all in the countryside and had been notified by telegram. He requested that the murderers be arrested and brought to justice and asked to claim the body for burial while his family came to Shanghai to arrange the funeral. When questioned, Ye Chunian confessed that he lived with Ye Sizhong, that Ye Sizhong had a seven-year-old grudge with the deceased, and that last night Ye Sizhong called me and Zhou Jie

to go together.

At the time, I was only guarding the apprentice, and Ye Sizhong and Zhou Jie stabbed the deceased to death. The court ruled that Tang Shenglin died from knife wounds and ordered the body to be released to Tang Zhilin for burial. The suspect was handed over to the police department for handling according to law, and the three murder weapons were impounded and returned to the original detective for investigation.

Falsely Accuses Her of Infidelity, Cousins Conspire to Commit Assault

Abduct Her to Remote Wilderness and Sever Her Achilles Tendons

Leaving Her Crippled, Husband Detained for Investigation

Wang Chunrong, 36 years old, from Yancheng, made a living pulling a rickshaw. His wife, Wang Li, 31 years old, worked in a yarn factory and lived in a shed in the western suburbs of Shanghai. They had been married for over ten years and had several children, but only one son remained, who was 13 years old this year. Li provided meager support for the family. Wang's elder cousin, Wang Chunjun, was a tiger-cart driver and coveted his cousin's wife, Li.

He repeatedly harassed her, but she firmly rejected him. Chunjun, unable to achieve his goal, harbored resentment. Last year, he cleverly slandered Li to his younger cousin Chunrong, claiming that Li was unfaithful and having an affair, which he had witnessed, and that the younger brother should punish her. Chunrong believed him and asked Chunjun what method to use for punishment. Chunjun devised a plan. On the 13th day of the first month of the lunar year, Chunrong first scolded his wife Li and then ordered her to write a letter of repentance,

and affix her fingerprint. One night, Chunrong and Chunjun, the two cousins, lured Li to a remote wilderness near their residence, among abandoned graves. Chunrong used a blanket to cover her head, pinned her to the ground, and Chunjun used a knife to commit the crime, severing her right Achilles tendon. After the deed was done, they carried her back home, preventing her from going out and isolating her from the outside world. She has been lying at home ever since, for two months, and her right foot has become crippled. She felt depressed

and had no outlet to express her grievances. Until recently, she managed to sneak out of the house and hired a car to her mother's brother's house at No. 51, Jiji Lane, Dapu Bridge, French Concession, to cry and complain. However, her husband, Wang Chunrong, learned of this, tracked her down to her uncle's house, and tried to take his wife home. The uncle, seeing how cruel Wang was, believed that if she were taken back, he would surely hold a grudge and put her to death. Therefore, he firmly refused to let his niece return. Wang Chunrong, seeing that his uncle firmly refused, argued with him, making a great commotion, unreasonable. The uncle then reported the case to the French Police, who sent detectives to

arrest Wang Chunrong. The case was taken into custody and sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday afternoon. Judge Wu Kechou heard the case, and Chen Ming, a lawyer from the French Concession administrative authorities, requested a postponement of the investigation and then requested an inquiry. The court questioned the defendant Wang Chunrong briefly and ruled that the case be adjourned for further investigation and questioning. The defendant was taken into custody.

The well-known soil vendor Guo Jinyu originally ran a silk shop in Changshu and had considerable assets. After Changshu fell, he colluded with Japanese and puppet personnel. In addition to continuing his old business, he found the profit from selling opium to be substantial. He and the puppet "Detective Team Leader" Zhu Shunqing opened opium dens in Changshu, Suzhou, and Wuxi, controlling sales and providing it to people to smoke. He also opened a Shanghai-based business on the surface operating in silk fabrics but in reality transporting opium. He used two self-provided trucks to transport large quantities of opium, hidden within the silk fabrics. Because the procedures were secret, it was never uncovered. On the 25th of this month, he was transporting opium worth more than 30,000 yuan from Shanghai to the inland, with Guo personally escorting the truck. However, when driving near Zhang Zongbang on the 57th bridge of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, more than ten people suddenly jumped out from the roadside, brandishing weapons and ordering the truck to stop.

### Letter

To whom it may concern, a piece of news about our group was published in various newspapers in this city on the 28th of this month, stating that with the arrival of summer and the recurrence of hot weather, there is an urgent need to purchase medicines, and due to limited funds, our group has notified the various trade associations to handle business profit sharing and other matters. This is not true. Our group did send letters to the various trade associations, requesting that they jointly organize business profit sharing, but it was for the purpose of overall and sustained refugee relief, and not just for the meager funds to purchase medicines. We are deeply afraid of causing misunderstandings. Accordingly, we request that you publish this letter in the letter column of your newspaper to clarify the truth and make corrections. Thank you very much. Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Trade Association Fundraising Committee.

### Overview of National Social Education (II)

(2) Promotion of Libraries (A) "Enriching the National Peiping Library" The Ministry headquarters and the China Education and Culture Foundation Board jointly established the National Peiping Library Committee to oversee all matters and build a new library. Its grand scale and rich collection make it the leading library in the country. (B) "Preparing to Establish the National Central Library" (Before the war, the library in Nanjing also handled the exchange of international publications. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund allocated 1.5 million yuan, to be disbursed over five years, for construction costs, etc. This has been reported in this newspaper multiple times. Recently, a branch library is being planned in Chongqing.) (C) "Expanding Local Libraries and Local Library Facilities" The number of libraries nationwide has now increased to 4,039. To enrich local library facilities, the Ministry of Education selected readings for middle school students from the Wan You Wen Ku series, compiled a catalog for publication, and issued a notice to all middle schools to purchase them. It also selected children's books and issued a notice to all elementary schools to purchase them. If funding is insufficient, the provincial and county governments should provide subsidies as appropriate. In order to circulate rare and ancient books in China, more than 900 rare or unprinted books were selected from the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries) for photolithographic reproduction. The first batch of more than 300 types reproduced was named "First Collection of Rare Unprinted Books from the Siku Quanshu" and has been published. The second collection is currently being printed.

(3) Promoting Broadcasting Education Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the focus has been on war resistance education materials. Currently, the Central Radio Station continues to broadcast war resistance education and civic knowledge programs on alternate days. All lecture scripts are compiled into a special collection of broadcasting pamphlets. Six types have been published, including "Air Defense," "Poison Gas Defense," "National Resistance," "Wartime Medicine," and "Wartime Japan." Starting from the 28th year, it will work with the Central Propaganda Department and the Central Broadcasting Affairs Management Office to jointly promote the installation of more radios in the rear to strengthen the power of broadcasting education.

(4) Promoting Film Education In addition to purchasing excellent foreign productions, educational films are also produced domestically by the provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces, as well as by some universities, but they are not sufficient to meet the demand. The Ministry of Education will jointly formulate a large-scale joint production plan with the Central Party Headquarters and other relevant agencies to meet the needs.

(Details of the implementation of various items by the Ministry of Education and various provinces and cities have been seen in previous reports.)

(5) Preservation of Documents and Antiquities (Such as the preservation of Tang sculptures and the preparation for the establishment of the National Museum, details omitted).

(6) Promoting Art Education (Such as holding the London Art Exhibition and the Second National Art Exhibition, etc.).

(7) Raising Social Education Funding The provinces and cities whose social education funding reached the prescribed percentage in the 24th and 25th years include Jiangsu, Guizhou, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Suiyuan, Tianjin, Beijing, and Qingdao. Shaanxi and Ping (Jinxi) are also not far from the prescribed percentage. It is also stipulated that if new sources of education funding are opened up in the future, the percentage of social education at the provincial and municipal level should be at least 30%, and at the county and city level, it should be 30% to 50%.

(8) Training Social Education Talents At present, most universities and colleges of education have added social education or people's education departments. Beijing Normal University has listed people's education as a required subject. Various normal schools have also added social education or people's education disciplines. Jiangsu has established an independent college, Shandong has established a research institute, and Hebei, Henan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang have established long-term training institutions. Most provinces and cities such as Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Suiyuan, Chahar, Anhui, Shaanxi, Hubei, Qinghai, and Shanghai have also established special training classes.

(9) Promoting Music Education and Drama Education (Details have been recorded in previous reports)

(10) Compiling and Reviewing Popular Reading Materials In the past two years, 97 types of manuscripts have been compiled and solicited from the Common Knowledge Library, of which 55 types have been reviewed and adopted. For comic books, in addition to reviewing hundreds of types popular on the market, 28 types have been compiled and solicited, of which 13 types have been reviewed and adopted. For popular literature, 13 types, 8 have been reviewed and adopted. Fifty types have been self-compiled for the popular series of books during extraordinary times. After the War of Resistance, high education personnel registered after withdrawing from the war zone, and a portion of personnel were designated to compile 45 types of popular common sense and 4 types of comic books. In total, in the past two years, excluding the review of popular reading materials purchased on the market, 232 types of manuscripts have been self-compiled and solicited, of which 170 types have been reviewed and adopted. All of the above-mentioned adopted manuscripts, except for the popular reading materials during extraordinary times, which have been printed by Chongqing Zhengzhong Book Company, are also being printed. Recently, the Ministry of Education, in order to promote wartime social education, believes that popular reading materials are even more important, and a popular reading material group has been specially set up under the Textbook Compilation Committee to be responsible for the compilation and review work.

(11) Ordering all levels of schools to concurrently handle social education (Details have been published in previous reports)

(12) Ordering all social education institutions to move to the rear. The National Central Library, National Museum, National Peiping Palace Museum, National Drama School, etc. have moved to Chongqing. The National Peiping Library has moved to Kunming and is working as usual.

(13) Relieving social education personnel in the war zone.

(14) Stipulating various social education facilities during wartime (Details have been seen in previous reports)

(15) Establishing Social Education Supervisors Regulations were formulated in mid-May of the 27th year, ordering ten provinces including Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Jiangxi to establish social education supervisors. It is stipulated that each administrative inspectorate district in each province should set up one supervisor, who should regularly patrol the counties and cities in the district, and be responsible for supervising, promoting, assisting, preparing, inspecting, guiding, and training personnel, and strive to promote social education quickly, not just inspecting the original undertakings. In June of the 27th year, the Ministry of Education set up a training class for social education supervisors in various provinces and cities in Hankou. 67 personnel were sent by various provinces and cities to receive training. After graduation, the Ministry of Education has issued orders to various provinces for employment.

(16) Convening Social Education Discussion Meetings (Details have been seen in previous reports) (End)

Children's Weekly

### The Origin of May Day Labor Day

— Yiming

Children! Tomorrow is Labor Day. Here are some historical materials and facts about Labor Day, the purpose of which is to give you a further understanding of this labor commemoration.

Labor Day originated in the United States. In the past, American workers, like workers in other countries, suffered from the oppression and bullying of capitalists. But the American workers finally woke up. On October 7, 1884, American and Canadian workers first met in Chicago and resolved to strike in alliance every May 1st, starting in 1886, to resist the oppression of capitalists. The slogan put forward at that time was "Work for eight hours, rest for eight hours, educate for eight hours?" The so-called "three-eight system" will not stop until the goal is achieved. Two years later, on May 1st, American workers marched in line, shouting slogans, and staged an unprecedented demonstration. However, it was very common for American workers to work more than ten hours a day. But after that resolute demonstration, not long after, the American capitalists agreed to the workers' demands and implemented the eight-hour workday factory system. After the American workers won this unprecedented victory, they designated May 1st as American Labor Day.

After the American workers won the victory, the result was that the European workers also woke up and understood the pain they were suffering? So they also gathered and marched on May 1st to demonstrate to the capitalists, putting forward the same slogan as the American workers, implementing the "three-eight system," and improving labor treatment. As a result, the capitalists also successively agreed to the workers' demands. In 1889, the International Socialist Party met in Paris, the capital of France, and decided to designate May 1st as International Labor Day.

In this way, Labor Day was quickly introduced from the United States and the United Kingdom to the whole world. And China has had this Labor Day since the early years of the Republic of China. Every year on May 1st, factories routinely have a day off. However, Chinese workers have always been under the oppression of the capitalists and did not wake up. Except for a day off on "May 1st," they did not make any demands. It was not until the success of the Northern Expedition and the unification of the country that the government paid special attention to labor. The general capitalists have also changed their attitude towards workers from their previous appearance. Under the leadership of labor unions, workers in various places sometimes have labor disputes, but there is always no excessive action. Labor and management are mostly able to cooperate, and of course there is no need for strikes and demonstrations. In short, in recent years, the status of Chinese workers has improved a lot, and it is true that the government has paid special attention to workers since the war. This is of course also influenced by Labor Day.

### An Astronomer Who Was Once a Shepherd Boy

— Jingtian

Children! Don't be surprised, how can a shepherd boy become an astronomer? This is what the ancients said: "Where there is a will, there is a way." As long as there is a firm and unwavering purpose and a spirit of perseverance, then anything can be accomplished. If you don't believe it, please read the story below.

This shepherd boy was the youngest son of a Scottish worker named James Ferguson; he loved to read since he was a child. When his brothers were studying, he often listened carefully by the side, and he also liked to ask questions, so he recognized many characters when he was very young; his father knew that he was a promising talent, and he also wanted to send him to school, but because of economic pressure, he finally gave up this plan, so the unfortunate Ferguson had to be a shepherd boy. This job was very easy, and he had a lot of free time. During this time, he often made various models, such as spinning wheels and windmills, but what he loved most was not these things, but the glittering stars in the sky.

Night came, the fiery red sun hid behind the horizon, and many brilliant stars were arranged on the high and low mountain peaks; Ferguson took a blanket and sat on the dark prairie like a ghost. He held a bow in his hand, and there were nine movable beads on the tightly pulled string. He raised the bow and pointed it at a group of stars in the sky, and moved the beads left and right at the same time to cover up one star, and then he moved another bead to cover up another star. Then he said to himself: "This is the distance between the two stars, which is measured as one inch on the string." Then he drew two points on the paper to represent the distance and position of the two stars; he continued to observe the distance and position of the other stars on his bowstring and beads again and again, so Ferguson made a star chart.

One day, Ferguson's star chart was seen by his master—a farmer—who initially thought it was ridiculous, but his expression immediately became solemn because he already knew the meaning of the chart; after he finished listening to the shepherd boy—James Ferguson—telling his wish, he encouraged Ferguson to copy the chart clearly, enlarge it, and publish it. In a few years, Ferguson became a famous and exquisite astronomer, and he was also elected as a member of the Royal Society of England.

Ferguson, in this harsh environment, finally completed his wish by relying on his own efforts. What's more, you have a good environment. As long as you work hard, then your wishes can all be realized. Children, hurry up and work hard!

### Returning Home Joyfully

— By Bai Zheng

— Nineteen of the Child's Refugee Diary —

On the fifth day of the Jiangshan boat's journey, Ming’er idly looked out from the bow of the boat, having finished his lunch a while ago. The boatman was vigorously poling, and after poling for some time, he stopped to rest, using smoking to relieve his fatigue.

"How much further have we gone today? Where will we stop for the night?" Ming'er muttered to himself, his eyes still fixed on the scenery, not daring to ask the boatman directly, as he had once been ignored for asking such a question. However, there had been a time when the boatman had answered quickly, so he thought this indirect approach was the most appropriate way to test the boatman's response.

"Today? Only about thirty li. Tonight, we must reach Yanzhou, which is my hometown." To his surprise, the boatman replied cheerfully and readily, probably because he was returning home. Ming'er also thought that returning home was the happiest thing, but unfortunately, Yanzhou was his home. If Yanzhou were his hometown instead, he would jump for joy on the boat today. At this moment, a wave of frustration washed over him. He wondered when they could return to their hometown.

The sun gradually sank in the west, and the boatman stood tall on the bow, one hand shielding his eyes, both to block the glare of the strong sunlight and to peer intently into the distance. After looking for a while, he poled even harder than before, urging his boatmen to speed up, eager to return home sooner and enjoy family happiness.

Flocks of returning crows cawed as they flew, flapping their wings as if encouraging themselves, singing and flying back to their nests. Some were ahead, some were behind, racing to see who would be the first to return to their nest, thereby being the happiest.

The boat gradually approached the boatman's sole destination. Tunxi, although also his destination, was merely a financial goal for him. He opened his blood-basin-like mouth wide, a trace of a smile appearing amidst the wrinkles on his face. He pointed northeast with a rough finger and said to Ming'er, who had the opposite feeling, "Those many houses with smoke rising are my hometown." Ming'er responded casually.

The lights gradually became more visible. By then, the sun had sunk below the horizon. The boat had entered the estuary of Yanzhou, and boats lined the riverbanks in neat rows on both sides. The boatman excitedly greeted and called out to people as if returning home in triumph. When passing a boat that was about the same size as theirs, the boatman said to Ming'er, "That's my elder brother's boat." Standing on the bow of that boat was a person who looked very similar to the boatman, but was slightly shorter, undoubtedly his elder brother.

At this point, the Jiangshan boat seemed to speed up, eventually stopping beside a large boat, which was the boatman's home. Before the boat had fully stopped, the boatman put down his pole and quickly jumped onto that boat.

Curious, Ming'er wanted to see what the boatman's home was like. As soon as the boat stopped, they all crowded into the cabin. The boat was much larger, and the cabin was well-equipped. Ming'er saw the boatman holding a child and leading another who was a bit older, undoubtedly his beloved sons. The boatman's mother, her withered face beaming with a smile, greeted them, bringing tea and chairs, bustling about. The boatman's eldest son even put on a gramophone to entertain them, making the hospitality seem very thoughtful. However, the boatman's wife was unfortunately ill in bed that day, and he did not get to see her beautiful face. The boatman went back to the Jiangshan boat to retrieve two chickens he had brought from Hangzhou, but unfortunately, one had already died. He gave them to his mother, showing his filial piety and his deep care for his family. The boatmen also brought their pipes, lying in the rattan chairs, comfortably smoking, plumes of smoke swirling in the boat canopy. The boatman and his mother spoke in a dialect that Ming'er did not understand, probably discussing the tense situation in Hangzhou since they last met. The gramophone played the tune of "Little Peach Red," which Ming'er usually found annoying, but now, after being away from home for so many days, he found it somewhat nostalgic. The sounds of conversation, music, and smoking filled the entire boat canopy with a festive atmosphere. Unable to bear the smoke, Ming'er dejectedly walked out of the canopy and back to the cold and desolate Jiangshan boat, recalling the joys of his own hometown, and couldn't help but shed a few tears, which trickled into his dry mouth, leaving a bitter aftertaste.

### Becoming a Little Radio Amateur (8)

— By Xi Ren

4. Installing the Antenna and Ground Wire

Wang Min's cousin first tied the antenna insulator ropes together in a knot, then tied two bamboo poles to the two peaks of the roof. Then, he secured the finished antenna to the bamboo poles. The lead-in wire from the antenna was brought down from the roof and connected directly to the radio in the room. However, it was important to buy new insulation for the lead-in wire, and never buy used goods, because old insulation often has many breaks. If these breaks touched other things, the radio waves from the antenna would be transmitted to other objects.

After watching his cousin set up the antenna on the roof, Wang Min asked, "Brother, is the antenna completely done like this? Is there anything else?"

His cousin listened to him, looked at the completed antenna on the roof, and thought for a moment, then said, "Well, the antenna is almost complete. But come on, Min, let's take a look."

Wang Min and his cousin went to the lead-in wire and carefully examined it again to see if there was anything amiss. After looking around, they felt that everything was in order, and then he said to Wang Min, "Min, okay, the antenna is done. Now, let's start working on the ground wire."

"Isn't the ground wire supposed to be connected to the water pipe?" Wang Min asked.

His cousin replied, "The ground here is mostly cement, so it's not easy to drive in an iron rod. Connecting it to the water pipe is the same. "As his cousin spoke, he separated the insulation he had bought, measured the dimensions, and found that it was just enough to reach from the water pipe to the radio inside the house. As he worked, his cousin said to Wang Min:

"Min, watch carefully, this is how it's done: First, scrape the insulation off the wire until it's clean, exposing the brass copper strands. Scrape about a foot of it, then use a knife to scrape away the dirt on the surface of the water pipe. After cleaning it, wrap the copper strands around it. That's how the ground wire is made."

"Now that the ground wire is done, what do we do?" Wang Min asked, eager to work on the radio now that he heard the antenna and ground wire were finished. Sure enough, his cousin replied, "We can work on the radio now."

Wang Min's heart was filled with joy!

### Games Along the Road

— By Zixi

Friends! If everyone pays a little attention, you can see children playing "marbles," "water chestnut battles," "jump rope," "roller skating," "tag," "riding bicycles," and various other games along the road. Playing games is supposed to be a good thing and beneficial and is originally a demonstration of children's instincts. But playing games is okay if it is done in a playground, in a gym, in a school, or in an empty space in a home. However, playing games along the road inevitably leads to many dangers. Just look at how crowded the passersby are and how numerous the various vehicles are. One moment of carelessness and danger is immediately created. I have personally seen pedestrians' leather shoes crush children's hands, automobile wheels injure children's legs, and children on roller skates knock down pedestrians on the road. According to my friends, these types of dangerous incidents have already been seen many times. These facts have already been noted by the authorities of the Concession police, who have strictly ordered the patrol officers along the road to prohibit it. Violators are taken to the police station for detention and punishment, or flogged on the spot. But how can the sight of a patrol officer focus on every part of the road? Moreover, the clever children have already left when they see the patrol officer coming, so children's games along the road are still very developed.

Little friends! As I said before, playing games is supposed to be beneficial, but please don't just play games on the road!

### Diligence Has Merit, Play is Useless

— By Zhou Xing, Sixth Grade Student, Jingyuan Elementary School

We Chinese people are more fond of play than diligence, but in recent years, people have suddenly become aware of the lovableness of diligence and have gradually become diligent in their work, so all kinds of undertakings have developed. There are several kinds of benefits of diligence, which I will briefly describe in the following points: (1) Suppose there are two people, one who loves diligence and one who loves play. They both look at a book at the same time. The diligent person can finish reading it in two or three days and understand the meaning inside. Then they look at the second book and can get a lot more knowledge in the same amount of time. But what about the playful person? I'm afraid they won't finish reading the book in a week! Not to mention the meaning inside, so you can know that diligence is better than play. (2) If there are two workers, A and B, who are both plasterers, one day two families suddenly ask them to build a house. When A is building the house, they always rest, smoke, and waste time, so they have not finished building the house in a year and naturally haven't earned any money. But what about worker B? They are completely the opposite. They build the house all day long, without taking a break, until the day's work is done, and then they do some private affairs. The owner of the house is very happy with them and often praises their diligence in front of relatives and friends and introduces them to friends to build houses, so they have built many houses in half a year and have earned a lot of money.

The harms of play have been clearly pointed out in the two examples above. You can neither gain knowledge nor earn money. In short, play cannot develop a career. As the ancient saying goes, "Proficiency comes from diligence," meaning that no matter what we do, we must be diligent in order to be excellent.

Little friends! Do you like diligence or play? If you are diligent, become more diligent. Those who like to play should quickly correct their mistakes and implement diligence! You must know that play is useless and harmful.

### May Has Arrived

— By Liu Shengyuan, Fifth Grade Student, Minsheng Elementary School

Turning the calendar day by day, letting time pass in a hurry, I suddenly see that the calendar is showing the words "May". Oh! May, known as the month of national humiliation, has come before us again!

In China, there is almost no month that does not have a day of national humiliation, which is really heartbreaking, especially May. It has the most days of national humiliation, among which, in addition to May 1st, which is International Labor Day, May 4th, which is the Student Movement Commemoration Day, and May 18th, which is the Chen Qimei Martyrdom Commemoration Day, May 3rd is the Jinan Massacre Commemoration Day, May 7th is the day when Japan proposed the Twenty-One Demands, May 9th is the commemoration of Yuan Shikai, who wanted to be emperor, admitting the humiliating conditions, and May 30th is the Shanghai Massacre Commemoration Day. Counting them up, they account for a large proportion of all national humiliations.

Why do we have national humiliations? Although it is because of the power of the great powers, the main reason is that the Chinese people do not know how to invigorate themselves and give up on themselves, allowing the national power to weaken day by day, so foreigners see us as easy to bully and use force to oppress us, so this is really our humiliation.

However, our country has now unveiled the great war of resistance against slavery, and the whole country is united in resisting foreign insults. We must not only clear away the national humiliations but also make the country strong. In this vigorous era, we feel unparalleled glory in everything. No matter which national humiliation comes, we do not feel ashamed or embarrassed at all.

### How to Learn Arithmetic

— By Zhang Zhenfu, West District Elementary School, Public Works Bureau

Little friends, what is the most headache-inducing course we feel in school? I think you will definitely say "arithmetic"! However, as long as we can study hard, arithmetic is not difficult to learn, and it will even make us feel interested. How to study?

(1) Study more: Arithmetic is like writing compositions; if you don't study it often, you will become rusty, so you must study it more so that it doesn't feel difficult.

(2) Memorize formulas: Formulas are very important in arithmetic and must not be forgotten, otherwise, you will not be able to do the problems.

(3) Consider carefully: When doing application problems, you must first understand the meaning of the problem, and then think about it carefully. If you study with this kind of care, you won't do them wrong.

### Autobiography of a Swing

— By Qi Jinmei, Fourth Grade Student, Zhendong Elementary School

My name is Swing, and I used to live in the forest. I had many companions. One day, several workers came and cut down me and my companions and sold us to a carpentry shop. The carpenter was really strong. He made me into strips, nailed them together again, and sold me to a teacher at a school. The teachers put me in a playground. I was afraid that the students would break the ropes above me, and I would fall down, and I was also afraid that they would push me over. Later, I waited patiently to see what would happen. After waiting for a while, a child came over, sat on me, and swung back and forth, looking very proud. Suddenly, a group of children came, and the first child jumped down. They scrambled to sit on me. Some of them swung higher than the frame, and if they lost their grip and fell down, their heads would be broken and bleeding. It's all their own fault. If they were good friends with me, they wouldn't have ended up like this.

### Snow White (16)

— By Tiansun

Snow White's glass coffin had been placed in the forest for several months. She slept soundly in the coffin, her beautiful face still unchanged. Wildflowers smiled, good birds sang, accompanying her loneliness. But before long, the news of the beautiful princess in the glass coffin spread everywhere, and everyone far and wide knew about it. This news finally reached the ears of the young and beautiful prince. He was immediately moved and suspected that the sleeping person in the glass coffin was the long-lost Snow White. He had been thinking about her for a long, long time. He immediately made up his mind to go and take a look, so he jumped on his white horse without hesitation and rushed to where the seven dwarfs lived.

The white horse never stopped, running as fast as chasing the wind and electricity, and soon arrived in that forest. When he saw the glass coffin, his eyes immediately blurred and were filled with tears. When he went closer to look, he saw Snow White's beautiful corpse lying stiffly there, her snow-white face even more beautiful than before. He couldn't help but lower his head and kiss Snow White's cold lips as a final farewell.

Strangely enough, after the prince's sweet kiss, Snow White's stiff body suddenly moved, as if a child was waking up from a deep sleep, slowly opening her closed eyes and immediately seeing the prince, giving a slight smile. It was as if a beautiful rose had bloomed in the spring breeze. The prince was overjoyed and quickly stretched out his two strong arms to lift Snow White from the coffin, truly loving her and unable to let her go. It turned out that this first kiss of love had broken the evil magic of the queen's green apple. The queen harmed herself, sacrificing her own life in vain, while Snow White was resurrected from then on.

The seven dwarfs watched from the side and were overjoyed, spinning around, hugging each other, and laughing uncontrollably. The little birds in the trees were also extremely happy, joining together and singing loudly, almost bursting their little throats. All the rabbits, deer, and other small animals in the forest jumped around, making joyful noises, all celebrating the princess's resurrection.

The prince thought that he couldn't rest easy leaving Snow White here, so he decided to take her back with him. On the day of departure, the princess kissed the seven dwarfs goodbye one by one, and everyone reluctantly parted, feeling very reluctant to part with each other. At that time, the princess promised them that she would definitely come back to visit them every spring when the flowers smiled and the birds sang.

At this point, Snow White's heart was filled with joy, thinking that the hard times were over and her past dreams had finally come true. The prince picked her up from the ground and rode on the white horse together. Their intertwined figures gradually disappeared in the shadow of the setting sun, heading straight back to his cloud palace.

From then on, the two of them lived together in the cloud palace, living a happy life forever. (The End)

### Finance Tianjin Gold Prices Soar

Local Cash Initially Falls Then Recovers

Yesterday, the cash "shia chih" [unclear term] in the off-market situation showed a fluctuating trend, with prices first falling then rising, ultimately recovering. The initial opening was due to operators basing their actions on Mr. X's frequent remarks that, although war would not break out in the short term, war panic still existed. Therefore, the buying interest was slightly weak. Although the Xiamen gang entrusted a certain gold firm to purchase, the amount was limited. Moreover, the silver shop gang and money exchange businesses (acting for wealthy individuals) supplied a lot of gold. Therefore, the market fell, and by the noon closing, it had retreated to a low of 2,072 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that the North China Provisional Bank was experiencing turbulence, that the counterfeit currency had fallen sharply, and that gold prices in Tianjin had soared. The Tianjin gang's buying interest was strong, entrusting a certain money exchange business to forcefully absorb about 200 taels. The price then rose back to a high of 2,080 yuan. However, as the wealthy took advantage of the high prices to sell again, it repeatedly fell. As a result, it closed up only 2 yuan from the previous day, with quiet trading of about 500 taels. Silver shop gold ornaments increased by one yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold, etc., remained unchanged.

"Shia Chih" Only Rose 2 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar of eleven taels, the initial opening lacked buyers, resulting in a long period without trading. It was not until 10:25 that a transaction was seen. The first was a purchase by a certain gold firm on behalf of the Xiamen gang, with the silver shop gang buying a total of 100 taels, with the opening price at 2,074 yuan, 1 yuan lower than the closing price the night before yesterday. After opening, the gold firm stopped advancing and observed, so the situation remained slightly weak. Money exchange businesses traded 50 taels with each other, with the price at 73.5 yuan. After that, buyers became increasingly scarce, leading to a historically silent market. After 11:00, the money exchange businesses were seen selling 50 taels to the silver shop gang, with a noon closing price of 72 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that the North China Provisional Bank was experiencing turbulence, so the initial opening buying sentiment was quite strong. Local and Tianjin customer gangs were increasingly enthusiastic. As a result, prices rose. The first transaction was by a certain money exchange business buying from a colleague for 50 taels, with the price at 74 yuan, followed by the gold firm and colleagues each buying 10 taels for 77 yuan. Then, the gold firm bought 50 taels for 80 yuan. One money exchange firm bought on behalf of [unclear] then fell. The money exchange businesses [unclear] 50 [unclear] for 78 yuan, then [unclear] 50 taels for 1,077. The closing price resulted in [unclear] 2 yuan [unclear]. The cash gold sold by the local brand gold shops was priced at 2,080 yuan, and bought in at 2,070 yuan. The cash standard gold was priced 50 yuan lower than the listed price, but no trading occurred.

Ornamental Gold Up One Yuan

The selling price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael has not changed. However, due to the rise in "shia chih", the price was raised by one yuan at 3:05 PM. Da Tong Hang was listed at 211 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang was listed at 209 yuan. The purchase price was 203 yuan. It is said that Da Tong Hang's jewelry gold in May will be relocated by Bei Qing Yun Cheng, from the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yinhua Street, starting tomorrow.

British Gold Remains Unchanged

According to a London telegram on the 28th, British pure gold per ounce remains unchanged at £7 8s 6d. As a result, the People's Bank of China's purchase price of Chinese cash also remained unchanged at 1,212.3 yuan. The listed price of customs gold also remained flat at 2.386 [unclear]. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged at 1,207.6 yuan.

### Rediscount Enters 50 Yuan Again

Yesterday, the bill discount rate sharply decreased. Each thousand yuan had retreated into the 50 yuan range. At one point, it even fell to 49.25 yuan. However, it slightly recovered by noon to 49.5 yuan. In the afternoon, it maintained the original price, finally remaining at 49.5 yuan, continuing to drop by half a yuan from the previous day.

### Foreign Firms Continue to Settle Forward and Spot Foreign Exchange

Yesterday, the bank's "ba feng" [unclear term] in the foreign exchange market had subsided. Although oil firms, such as Texaco, and other major foreign firms continued to aggressively settle forward and spot British and American currencies, because foreign commercial banks in Britain, the United States, and elsewhere still had a strong willingness to supply, the process remained flat and lacked change. As a result, British and American currencies were neither up nor down. The volume of trading during the morning was still strong. However, the Hong Kong currency situation continued to be slightly loose as money exchange businesses came back to sell.

In the early morning, both near and far London large bars were flat. New York banks remained unchanged. London raw gold also remained unchanged. The exchange rate for British to American, to Shanghai, and to French currencies was flat. American to British and to Shanghai was also flat, and to French was slightly 0.0625. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 8[unclear].25 for British currency and 16.0625 yuan for American currency, with no difference from the previous night's closing. After opening, although major foreign firms came to settle, because the willingness to supply from external banks was still good, it was not affected. Foreign firms settled spot British currency with British banks HSBC and Mercantile Bank for 8[unclear].25. Then, oil firm Texaco and other foreign firms successively bought spot American currency from a certain bank for 16.0625 yuan. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, and the announcement of the silver equalization tax also did not fall. It was still 6.0%. After that, major foreign firms again aggressively settled forward British and American currencies, but foreign commercial banks were also willing to supply as much as possible, so the situation remained very mediocre. Foreign firms settled seven or eight months of American currency with American banks for 15.9375 yuan, and also settled six or seven months of British currency with British bank HSBC for 8[unclear].21875. Near noon, trading became clear, and the Hong Kong currency loosened slightly as money exchange businesses came back to sell. They sold spot Hong Kong currency to foreign bank Banque Belge pour l'Etranger for 56 yuan, and then foreign bank Holland provided spot Hong Kong currency to foreign firms for 55.875 yuan. Therefore, the process was slightly loose. By the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was 8[unclear].25 for British currency, 16.0625 yuan for American currency, and 55.875 yuan for Hong Kong currency. As a result, compared to the previous closing, British and American currencies were neither up nor down, while Hong Kong currency continued to increase by 0.0625. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

### Hong Kong Currency Has Huge Transaction Volume

British and American Gold Notes Rise and Fall in Opposite Directions

Yesterday, British pure gold and British-American exchange rates remained unchanged. Foreign firms in the local area settled accounts quite frequently, and banks supplied them smoothly. Market prices remained stable as before. There was no market on Saturday afternoon. The "shia chih" [unclear term] opened, and gold firms supplied quite a lot, but money exchange businesses' buying interest was weak, and the market was soft. In the afternoon, customer gangs and securities gangs suddenly came to buy, but the supply was not abundant, and the market became prosperous. As a result, it rose slightly from the previous day. The supply and demand of foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, was not strong. Trading in British and American gold notes was quite active. The demand for British gold notes was more urgent, and market prices continued to rise. The supply of American gold notes was slightly smoother, and prices tended to loosen. The transaction volume of Hong Kong notes was very large, and prices were quite stable. There were very few public association transactions. Changtai sold and Hongchang bought Hong Kong notes for 500 yuan. Qintai sold and Hongchang bought British gold notes for £50. Yesterday's market prices were that British gold notes rose by one point, American gold notes fell by three tenths of one percent, and all other currencies remained unchanged.

### Tianjin Exchange Rate Soars by Four Yuan

### Securities: Domestic Debt Sentiment Again Becomes Uncertain

Jardine Matheson Shares Reach New High

High-Grade Foreign Debt Rises by One Pound

The securities gray market conditions yesterday were stimulated. The European war atmosphere after Hitler's speech has not dissipated, and the subsequent issues are complex and cannot be resolved in the short term. Market sentiment has therefore become uncertain. The excitement from the day before yesterday has become a thing of the past. Market prices seem to be entering a range-bound phase. After opening yesterday, the market prices were tight due to slight absorption by Northern interests, but then Dentsu, Lien Ho, and retail investors released more sell orders, leading to a weak market. The 38th stock was consistently sold off, and spot goods continued to flow out. The morning ended down about 0.2 yuan. Due to Saturday's market, the afternoon trading was extremely thin and prices stabilized. Lien Ho, Zhen Kang No. 5, and No. 16 stocks were all sold, while De Fu continued to buy. No. 20 and others also showed some interest in buying, but the market price still ended down about 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was over 500,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Stock transaction: 300 shares of Nanshi Huashang Electric Co. shares were traded at a price of 5.45 yuan.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that stock market trading, except for Jardine Matheson shares, was not very active, but the market atmosphere was good. Because Hitler's speech did not contain any stimulating words, there were some buyers in the market. Because yarn prices rose again, Jardine Matheson shares were firm and expensive, reaching a new high price of 18.2 yuan. The closing buying price was 18.2 yuan, and the selling price was 18.3 yuan. Shanghai Cotton Mill shares also had good demand, with a price of 110 yuan. Rui Rong shares rebounded to 7.05 yuan, and Yi Song shares also rebounded to 100.5 yuan. Waterworks A shares were priced at 625 yuan, and tram shares were priced at 37.5 yuan (ex-dividend). Both stocks had demand. Rubber shares were sluggish. It is expected that British rubber inventories will decrease by another 750 tons by the end of this weekend.

London British Far East Company Stocks

The market prices listed on the 28th of this month (Friday) only saw an increase of 5 shillings for Chartered Bank shares, with a price of 7 pounds and 15 shillings. The rest remained unchanged.

London China Securities: The market prices listed on the 28th of this month (Friday) were stimulated by the European situation, and high-grade bonds rose by 1 pound to 5 shillings. The British-German Continuing Loan and the Rehabilitation Loan bonds each rose by 1 pound, with the former priced at 65 pounds and the latter priced at 52 pounds. Crisp Loan bonds continued to rise by 5 shillings, with a price of 36.5 pounds. The other three types each rose by 0.5 pounds. The Sino-French USD 5% bonds with Indian bonds rose to 63 pounds. British-French Loan bonds rose to 58 pounds. Vickers Aircraft Loan bonds rose to 17 pounds. However, lower-grade railway bonds remained weak.

### Grains: Dalian Soybeans, Cargo in Transit Higher Than Spot Goods

Although the Dalian soybean market situation once softened when cargo in transit was sold off, its potential strength was supported by active open and hidden sales. In the past three days, it has not been affected by the decline in oil prices. Although other beans do not meet the standards for oil extraction sales due to non-standardized goods (each unit of Grand Soybeans produces one or two catties less oil), the streets are still continuously selling them, and the market is optimistic due to the timely arrival and rare inventory. Yesterday, four truckloads of Dalian soybeans were traded at a price of 9.2 yuan and 9.21 yuan, and two truckloads of cargo in transit were settled at a price even higher than spot goods. The opening price for spot goods was 9.22 yuan. More than 300 bags of Pinghu soy beans were traded at a price of 10.05 yuan, 400 bags of Triangular Chongming Yellow Soybeans were traded at a price from 9.15 yuan to 8.95 yuan, and 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans were traded at a price of 9.23 yuan.

It has been verified that 1,045 bags of soybeans were imported yesterday from Tianjin, and 2,620 pieces of raw oil were imported from Qingdao.

### Yarn and Cotton: Sharp Drop in Counterfeit Currency Triggers Northern Purchases, Spot Yarn Rises Straight Up

Only Buying Sound Heard in the Market

Double Horse Reaches 434 Yuan

Selling Prices Jump by Ten Yuan, Beware of Reaction

The surge in the yarn market is the most intense seen this year, with new peaks emerging one after another. The reason for this is said to be the daily decline of Japanese and puppet currencies, which has caused all kinds of speculation. Northern merchants have also turned to the Chinese yarn market to search for goods, which has made the technical merchants more eager to buy. A buying sound has filled the market, creating a yarn shortage panic. Everyone is dragging each other in, racing to be first, which has made the price increases more intense, resulting in a straight upward trend. In the afternoon, the buying sound shook outside the market, and selling prices immediately jumped 7 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 434 yuan, a jump of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. However, only buyers were heard, and no sellers were seen. According to public opinion, the price must be watched at 450 yuan, so those going long are still thriving. However, after a sharp increase, a reaction cannot be prevented.

The situation of spot yarn: At the opening of the morning market, due to various rumors, the buying interest was still strong, and the opening price jumped by 6 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 430 yuan, and other medium-quality goods also advanced along with it. Then, as those who profited sold off, it fell back by 1 or 2 yuan. Until the close, it was still calm. Unexpectedly, the market changed greatly after the opening in the afternoon. Because the demand from the inland was strong, the market suddenly tightened, and there were few sellers. The market price jumped step by step, and the buyers did not ask why, only caring about taking delivery. This situation is too violent. Until the close, Bian Ma was traded at 434 yuan, and the rack price was 425 yuan. It has been verified that the total purchases of various merchants throughout the day totaled 3,485 bales. The transaction volume in the afternoon of the previous day was 570 bales. The total of the two days was 4,060 bales. The prices of 20-count Double Horse and Angel brands both rose by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Other coarse and fine yarns also rose by 5 yuan to 7 yuan. The factory opened 100 bales of 18-count Lion brand yarn from Litai Factory at a price of 375 yuan, and 500 bales of 20-count Lion brand yarn at a price of 405 yuan. Xinnuo Factory opened 100 bales of 20-count Five Sons brand yarn at a price of 410 yuan, from June to September. Chongxin Factory opened 500 bales of 10-count Dafa brand yarn at a price of 335 yuan, in May. Tongyi Factory opened 300 bales of 10-count Golden Rooster brand yarn at a price of 332 yuan. Litai Factory also opened 200 bales of 20-count Lion brand yarn at a price of 400 bales. Rongfeng Factory opened 300 bales of 20-count Golden Bridge flower velvet gray yarn at a price of 475 yuan. Tomorrow's export yarn includes 445 pieces to Shantou, 700 pieces to Hong Kong, 380 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 95 pieces to Beihai. The amount of purchases from each merchant is listed as follows:

The Japanese yarn market continues to rise wildly, and continues to soar. Because Northern customers do not ask about anything and collect wildly, it is said that hoarders are collecting because the counterfeit currency has fallen in price, and the Northern merchants are buying goods. However, this situation is also too violent. The price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn has risen to 400 yuan outside the customs.

### Cotton Lacks Great Vitality

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: New York cotton prices slightly fell by 3 to 5 points due to Hitler's speech. Afterwards, the market became chaotic, with near-term prices rising and far-term prices falling. At the close, banks and overseas cotton merchants were buying. As a result, near-term prices rose by 8 to 9 points, and far-term prices rose by 4 to 5 points. Yesterday, Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 1 rupee, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 10 points. Converted to legal currency, American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 0.9 yuan per dan, Indian cotton rose by 0.3 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by 1.2 yuan.

The Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading Market: In recent days, the sharp drop in counterfeit currency has triggered sales of yarn in North China. In addition, the recovery of Nanchang has greatly improved morale. Yarn prices have approached 450 yuan. It is expected that yarn prices may still rise. Each yarn factory also plans to take advantage of this price surge to open a batch of forward cotton yarn. At that time, each factory will replenish a large amount of raw cotton. However, given the current tense European political situation, the factories are temporarily watching and waiting for the development of all parties. The prices of yesterday's cotton market converted to factory delivery prices are listed below:

The local cotton business has slightly improved, but all purchases are from within the industry. The factories still have not taken any action, so the market situation is still lifeless. Xinyu Factory only imported 60 pieces of American cotton, and other manufacturers have no desire to purchase. The future of the cotton market is still faltering. However, the supply is very sluggish. Although the Subei route has not been completely cut off, the goods arriving are very few, only 370 bales. The current situation of spot cotton is recorded below:

### Silk and Tea: Chekiang Silk

Exports are Very Active, Factory's French Sales are Expanding

Foreign silk markets: Yesterday, Yokohama was closed due to the Emperor's Birthday. There were no fluctuations in New York and Lyon spot markets. New York Exchange near-term prices rose by 0.5 points, and far-term prices rose by 0.2 points. The silk market has reached a firm and stable state, and silk prices are expected to rise. The Shanghai silk market was very active yesterday, but only limited to Chekiang silk. The white factory's sales to the United States, reportedly offered at 1,750 yuan for 7-8 grade electricity, were still not accepted by foreign firms. Yihua and other firms imported six lots of Chekiang silk and nearly 120 dans of high-grade Chekiang silk, and market prices rose by 30 yuan compared to early April. White factory's French sales had been suspended for a long time. The B-grade grade offered at 1,700 yuan a few days ago has now received a response, with 90 dans traded. After this, French sales may become more lively. Recently, users of the silk market have been very tired. The white factory's B-grade ordinary brand was sold at 1,680 yuan, but the transactions were very sporadic.

Yesterday, 40 pieces of silk and 1,400 pieces of tea were imported, all from Hong Kong. In addition, 1,500 boxes of tea will be shipped to Europe today.

### New Green Tea Mountain Prices are High

Longjing Qiqiang Selling Prices Have Fallen

At the time when new tea is entering the market, Zhe Dong suddenly became tense. The ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou were repeatedly bombed, resulting in the blockade of the seaports and the interruption of transportation. Each tea factory in this city had previously sent personnel to Ningbo, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, and Huzhou in Zhejiang Province to prepare to purchase new green tea for shipping to Shanghai for production and sales. It is now known that the asking price for new tea in Shangyu, Ningbo, has reached over 110 yuan, a record high. Green tea in Wenzhou is also around 50 yuan. It is said that they are still holding on and waiting and seeing. As for Huzhou, purchasing is difficult. Observing the operation of foreign tea companies in this city this year, it is quite difficult to start. As for the new Longjing and Qiqiang teas for domestic sales in the tea shops, the prices have recently been reduced by 20 to 30 yuan. New Longjing has fallen from 140 to 150 yuan to 110 to 120 yuan, and Qiqiang has fallen from 100 yuan to 70 to 80 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Production Prices are Relaxing

According to foreign news reports yesterday, sugar market prices for production have slightly relaxed. Although the Shanghai market is still rising, there is a sign of stabilization. The association's board set the price of 24 coarse white transit goods at 19.55 yuan, then slightly relaxed to 19.5 yuan. Spot goods in this warehouse were 27.8 yuan, with a total transaction of 300 to 400 bags. Taikoo carload white throwing prices tightened again, with July Hong Kong currency at 10.75, but has not yet dared to telegraph. Spot goods from the Western warehouse B mark were 27.05 yuan, then 27 yuan. Dutch red transit goods were 12.1 yuan, 200 bags, 12 yuan, 100 bags. National sugar opened 70 bags of Jiatai red at 15.7 yuan, 50 pieces of Zhuangpian green at 10.4 yuan, and 150 bags of Diaoqing at 13.8 yuan, all up 1 to 2 yuan. 2,270 pieces of sugar arrived from Shantou on the 29th.

### Paper: Tin Foil Market Prices are Leveling

Tin foil selling prices once rose when transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang was blocked. However, Shanghai's inventory is sufficient, and many merchants and hoarders took advantage of the high prices to sell. And since the Qingming Festival, digestion has been weak. The peak sales season must wait between summer and autumn. Therefore, market prices have gradually returned to level. At present, the selling price of high-grade 98 military products is 7 yuan per bar, and the highest price per piece of Lianer is 1.54 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: Huang Zhizi Shortage Rises

Huang Zhizi shipments from Quanzhou have been cut off for nearly two months, causing merchants to feel a deep shortage. Recently, there has been demand from the Northern merchants. Recently, a certain company brought 30 pieces of Erhong Zhizi from Shantou. The passage has been opened, and its price has risen by 7 to 8 yuan compared to the previous market. It is heard that the next batch of goods will arrive soon, and the market is firm.

### Piece Goods: Insiders and Outsiders Raise Prices to Buy, Cotton Cloth Price Increases are Truly Fearful

National Cloth White Goods Surge by Five Jiao

No One Sells Dongpi Spot Goods

National Cloth

Yesterday, the market continued to rise crazily. Speculative thoughts were enthusiastic. Insiders and outsiders from the same industry and the financial community repeatedly raised prices to buy. White goods, coarse cloth, coarse twill, fine cloth, and fine twill were the most popular, with prices rising from 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. In the morning market, a small number of peers sold their profits, with 300 pieces of coarse cloth and more than 200 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill being traded. In the afternoon, sellers gradually disappeared, and the market was chaotic, with quoted prices differing by as much as 0.5 yuan per piece. Colored cloth and bleached cloth were sluggish in sales, with thick inventories. The work of dyeing factories was extremely idle. At this time, it is difficult to cover the cost of purchasing gray cloth, bleaching, and dyeing before selling. The Guangzhou Bay purchases of bleached and dyed cloth are more prosperous, with a total of 4,000 pieces of bleached cloth, poplin, colored cloth, and colored twill being handled. The Tianjin merchants handled 5,000 pieces of poplin and striped bleached cloth. Most of the purchases from this street and the Sichuan and Yunnan merchants were pre-orders. Hoarders also purchased and hoarded 400 to 500 boxes of blue cloth and colored twill. Most manufacturers believe that the selling prices at this time are too harsh, and they would rather go to the warehouse and wait for a price to sell. Therefore, the inventory in each warehouse has been full for several days, and new accounts are difficult to find storage space.

East Cloth

The white goods market is rising, endlessly. Yesterday, due to rumors of soaring Japanese yarn, the financial community was eager to purchase and hoard. They handled 4,000 to 5,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill for next month (because no one is selling spot goods this month). The industry was shocked and lost color. The selling price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was jumping 0.7 yuan. Peers were caught off guard and did not know why. More than 4,000 pieces were opened to each foreign firm, of which only one-tenth were fine twill. The opening price is as follows:

Exports

One day, there will be 190 pieces of piece goods transported to Shantou, 230 pieces to Hong Kong, 100 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 9 pieces to Beihai, and 140 pieces to Haiphong.

### Food: Flour Factory Prices

Surge by 0.1 Yuan

Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market in this factory suddenly surged. The factory prices of No. 2 flour immediately shouted high at the opening of the market. This is because the sales to merchants in recent days have been consistently active, and each factory has already indicated a price increase, and the international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. The speech by the German leader is closely related to the future of grain prices. Therefore, domestic and foreign production prices have risen in recent days, raw material prices have risen daily, and the current spot foreign flour on the market is also rare. Factory flour has no competitive pressure for the time being. Therefore, factory prices were firm. In the morning, it passed the price of 4.5 yuan, but the factory was still unwilling to sell. Only the merchants in this street and scattered customers moved slightly. Later, the market price rose to 4.55 yuan before there was a slight supply. It is heard that there are still wholesale transactions from the Beiyang merchants that have not been finalized. Generally, it will be announced at the beginning of next week.

Foreign Flour: Foreign spot prices have also been reported to have risen again. It is difficult to agree on the price of fixed-term orders. The source of spot flour on the market is becoming increasingly tight. Although there is inventory, everyone is reluctant to easily sell it. In addition, under the sharp rise in factory prices, the sellers' asking prices have also increased by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, but buyers are not enthusiastically interested. In addition to scattered transactions on this street, the continuation of a ban on wholesale transactions.

### Gengxian Hoarders

Intensify Trading Again

Market Prices Rise Sharply by 0.2 to 0.3 Yuan

The sources of Dujing to various merchants, Heshang to Nangang Nos. 3 and 4, and Car Wheel Buns, were only 1,600 to 1,700 bags from Su Tong merchants. Since the arrival of goods was hindered, the Shanghai market became expensive, and merchants and hoarders all pulled in each other. The sellers took the opportunity to raise prices. For a time, the situation was chaotic. As a result, the price of thick and thin Geng rose by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, and all the bun goods were around 14 yuan, while Heshang was also at 13.7 to 13.8 yuan. Judging from this situation, if there are fewer goods arriving, then the market will be difficult to contain. The price of Duyangbu Jian has also increased by 0.1 yuan, and Bian Yuan has also increased by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan along with the Geng market.

Since the Yong merchant’s handling of Cunwei Ke failed to deliver the installation of the Ke Xian, the market originally had a tendency to flatten. And the sources of Jianglun have been continuous, and the inventory has gradually increased. Therefore, the handling of the hoarding is not greedy. However, the merchants in this street have recently been unable to use Jian to handle the situation because of the small and expensive arrival of Yangdujians in the inland, and the price of Yangjian has risen to nearly 15 yuan. All merchants in this street, shops, and factories have risen to replace the guest sin, yesterday the shops, factories, and factories on the street have paid very much. A number of deals have been added to more than 4000. China Pass machine and the digestion of the rice are very good, and the market has continued to rise one or two corners. The price of Xihong commodity market is about $17.30.

### North and South Goods: Qingdao Raw Peanuts Export

Still Restricted

Qingdao News: Export of raw peanuts there is still restricted, so there is a lack of transport to Shanghai. The production price is higher than in the first ten days of this month, and the price of a few dollars is sold in the southwest of 15 yuan and the price of fifteen yuan or two cents. Dongxiyang Village and the oil workshop have over 10,500 packets of a large packet of 15 yuan and 4 cents. Over 2,000 peanut sweets were handled, Wang Taishing eleven yuan to eleven yuan and two cents, Gao Misheng twelve yuan, and over 2,000 bags were traded.

### Honey Dates Source Cut Off Inventory Gradually Depleted

The inventory of honey dates in the market is gradually exhausted, such as bare and bald, have all been exhausted. Zhazawen Mouheng has a few hundred casks of super eggs, and his price has soared to 140 yuan or 50 yuan, and since the two routes have been closed by both Yong and Ou, there is no way to transport it to Shanghai.

### Hardware: Tinplate Sales are Booming

In yesterday's hardware transactions, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other merchants all had some embellishments, but not many. The egg factories and lard factories in this port had relatively smooth business, with the sales of tinplate being particularly prosperous, such as 90-pound double-linked American goods selling for 73 yuan (with guts) and 70 yuan (without), 100-pound double-linked American goods selling for 88 yuan (with guts) and 86 yuan (without), 90-pound double-linked Italian goods selling for 67 yuan, 100-pound double-linked Italian goods selling for 77 yuan, 90-pound single-linked British goods selling for 34 yuan, and 100-pound single-linked British goods selling for 36 yuan. It has been verified that a total of 300 to 400 boxes have been opened.

Spring and Autumn

### Wonders of the World's Fair

— Te Ye

The New York World's Fair is scheduled to open today. A general overview of the fair was already published in this column on the 19th of this month, sourced from Reuters. The Christian Science Monitor of the United States published an article about the fair, with descriptions different from what was previously published. Our newspaper also managed to obtain an aerial view of the entire fair, so we are translating and excerpting that article, attaching it after the image. Readers can use the image as a guide, almost like experiencing the fair without actually being there. If this can spark readers' interest and inspire them to visit in person, the benefits will certainly be significant.

The New York World's Fair, opening on April 30, 1939, can be described as bizarre and all-encompassing. On the surface, there are various novel entertainments suitable for both refined and popular tastes. More profoundly, there are ingenious creations that only the wise can fully understand. In countless forms, everything is captivating. Cultural, scientific, industrial, and artistic items occupy the most important part. Even more valuable is the Fair's underlying theme: "The wonders of today are always less than the wonders of tomorrow." Everything that science, inventions, and dreams can glimpse of the "world of tomorrow" is fully displayed in this fair. Therefore, in addition to providing entertainment for visitors, it also gives them an inspiration to "imagine tomorrow today."

The site of the Fair was once a pile of dirt and debris. It took 30 million pounds to complete. The entire site covers 1,216 acres, and walking around it would take eight hours. There are eight entrances to the fairground. No matter which entrance visitors use, they will eventually reach the "Theme Center," which features the two most unique structures of the entire fair: a giant sphere and a tall spire (see the center of the image). From this central point, fourteen important sections radiate out, each representing a key aspect of modern life. The layouts are all different, so visitors will have a different feeling in each area and will never mistake one area for another. All aspects of modern civilization are included in these fourteen sections. Their names are: Government Section, Production Section, Transportation Section, Communication Section, Distribution Section, Business Systems Section, Housing, Clothing, and Cosmetics Section, Nutrition Section, Health Section, Public Welfare Section, Education Section, Fitness Section, Fine Arts Section, and Religion Section. The entire venue can also be divided into three major areas: (1) exhibits from fair authorities and private industries; (2) exhibits from foreign participants and the United States; (3) the amusement area, similar to Asakusa Lake.

The sphere is a hollow sphere with a diameter of 200 feet, equipped with two escalators that can carry 8,000 people up and down per hour. It is an extremely beautiful location, as it provides a panoramic view of the surrounding scenery. Visitors first arrive at the base of the tall spire, then enter an elevator, and enter the interior of the sphere through an opening 50 feet above the ground. The sphere itself weighs 9.3 million pounds and is supported by eight columns, each weighing nine tons. The columns are all made of mirrored surfaces, with eight fountains constantly shooting water onto the mirrors, making the sphere appear to float in space. It is even more spectacular at night, when powerful electric lights shine through the clouds, making the sphere seem to slowly rotate on its axis.

Inside the sphere, each month moves one foot per second, completing a circuit of the inner circle in five and a half minutes. During that time, visitors can enjoy the beautiful scenery all around, which is called "Democracity" and represents the "garden city of tomorrow." At the same time, soft poetic sounds enter the ears. The poem was specially written for the fair by the famous poet Steele. Looking up, one can also see a majestic team marching and singing the fair's song.

The sphere and the spire are connected by a bridge. Below the sphere is a shimmering turquoise pool. Crossing the bridge leads to a wide spiral walkway that encircles the pool. On this walkway, one can see the entire fairground. The spire is triangular, made of steel, with each side of the base being 68 feet wide. It gradually narrows upwards, reaching a height of 700 feet above the ground. The spire is used for radio broadcasting.

Second in importance to the "Theme Center" is the "Avenue of Patriots," which is the central location of the exhibition area and the center of the entire fair. It is located about a mile northeast of the sphere and spire, extending directly to a large lake. The lake connects the exhibition area, the government area, and the foreign area. There are small waterfalls, small ponds, and fountains, with walking areas on the sides planted with over a thousand large trees, specially moved from other places. The area is dotted with many sculptures and statues. The "Four Freedoms" by the famous sculptor Friedlander, representing freedom of publication, religion, assembly, and speech, are also among them. There is also a sundial, 50 feet long, named "The Nature of Time," which is the work of Manship. Most awe-inspiring is the 60-foot-tall statue of Washington, who took office as the first President of the United States in New York 150 years ago. This fair is held in commemoration of that event. Each side of the "Avenue of Patriots" has giant buildings, with walls 40 to 50 feet high, covered with paintings and decorated with inlaid mosaics, depicting the progress of humanity from primitive times to the present day.

From the "Theme Center," several main roads radiate outward like a fan. There is also a transverse main road that connects the major radial roads in a broad arc. This main road is named "Rainbow Avenue" because the colors and lighting in this area are specially arranged, hence the name. In the guidebook, the buildings to the right of the "Theme Center" are shown in blue, gradually turning purple as they approach the "Avenue of Patriots." Upon reaching the Avenue, the color turns red, and then moves to the left, gradually turning orange, and finally turning yellow at the far left. "Rainbow Avenue" also changes color in the same way. At night, electric lights of the same colors as the buildings shine on the entire road, creating a colorful and beautiful spectacle. "Rainbow Avenue" truly resembles a long rainbow.

At the other end of the "Avenue of Patriots" is a large lake with a circumference of 800 feet. At night, water, fire, sound, and color are used to create a beautiful scene, which can be called a spectacle. It features a thousand water jets, shooting water up to 150 feet high. Every six water jets are clustered together, forming a water column. One of the jet rings, with a diameter of 90 feet, shoots water in various patterns, one of which resembles a golden sheaf of wheat, 90 feet high. In addition to the water jets shooting in various patterns, there are odorless gas pipes that emit flames of various colors, as well as flames emitting various exquisite shapes. Music is also incorporated; four large sound chambers amplify the music, truly creating a harmonious blend of water and fire, sound and color, showcasing the skills of technique and the pleasure of sight and hearing. It is estimated that the area around this lake can accommodate 500,000 spectators. Many people can enjoy this spectacle from the good seats in the surrounding restaurants and the thousands of resting chairs on both sides of the Avenue.

There is also a spectacle on "Fountain Lake," where a dozen or so pleasure boats slowly cruise, illuminated by searchlights like a white sheet. In addition, various specially made large electric lights are added. When the fireworks boats are active, the entire lake is filled with fireworks, creating a rare and magnificent view.

The fuel used for these two entertainment venues is jointly supplied by two companies. Burners with a diameter of up to eight inches are used, with additional attachments, to mechanically feed chemically treated wood layers and other colored miscellaneous materials into the device, creating flames of various colors. The colored flames, 150 feet high, shot out on "Fountain Lake" are produced using 24-foot Bunsen gas burners.

"The City of Tomorrow" is a major feature of the "Home Building Center," which covers an area of ten acres. About twenty fully equipped family homes are built there. This is to give home architects advanced ideas about the structure of residential houses, the matching of various materials, and interior decoration and furnishings.

The architecture in the foreign area combines the ancient and the modern. Ancient styles date back thousands of years, while new styles can be considered "ultra-modern." The Egyptian pavilion is a temple from the time of the ancient Pharaohs. The French pavilion is a modern circular building. The British pavilion is a majestic giant building. The Romanian pavilion is modeled after the extravagant scale of ancient Byzantine architecture. The Italian pavilion adopts a fusion of ancient Roman and modern styles. The Norwegian pavilion is a replica of a 17th-century imperial residence. The Japanese pavilion is a typical example of Eastern architecture. The Polish pavilion is a medieval fortress and a black glass building. Each of the other countries has its own unique features. The food in the foreign area is geographically categorized, allowing tourists to sample food from all over the world in one day. For example, have breakfast in Brazil, lunch in Czechoslovakia (note: when the author drafted this text, Czechoslovakia had not yet been annexed), afternoon tea in England, dinner in the Dutch East Indies, and a late-night snack in France.

The art gallery displays only the finest masterpieces, mostly limited to the works of ancient master painters and the essence of European and American paintings from the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The music hall can seat 2,500 people and can be considered the successor to international music gatherings.

The entertainment area covers 280 acres, extending in a large arc beyond the main arena and along Fountain Lake, offering a combination of novel and interesting attractions. Near the southern end of this area is a 250-foot-high parachute tower, equipped with eleven ornately decorated parachutes. Visitors first climb to the top of the tower, then sit under a parachute. Once the mechanism is activated, they float down, as if descending from an airplane, but without any danger. Other attractions include the "Enchanted Forest," magical electric lights, and mechanically animated artificial animals, with strange and unusual performances. Visitors to this area are happy and forget their fatigue. The various entertainments are divided into categories. For example, foreign villages, Cuba, and France are in the same section. "Little Old New York" is a section on its own. Horse riding and amazing games are combined into one section.

A playground has also been opened in "Children's World," staffed by dedicated personnel. Boys and girls can play, rest, and dine at will in "Children's World." There are various sports and amusements that are both entertaining and educational. Children aged four and older can all find entertainment suitable for their age.

The entrance to "Marine Transportation Hall" has façades on each side that are shaped like the bows of two large ocean liners. A semicircular side hall partially surrounds a pool, in which fully equipped pleasure boats and speedboats are moored. Along one wall, two levels of decks are created, spanning the small pool. On the mast, 150 feet high, which separates into spars, are hung colorful flags.

"Aviation Hall" displays models of large airplanes that cross the Atlantic Ocean. There is also a large airplane suspended in the sky, with its engines constantly rotating, making it appear to be flying. In front of the entrance of the hall is an open space of 26,000 square feet, in which several new types of airplanes are parked, including the latest flying clipper.

Between "Marine Transportation Hall" and "Aviation Hall" is "Motor Transportation Hall." One of the highlights of the exhibits is "Rocketport," which represents "Travel in the World of Tomorrow," allowing visitors to imagine the scene of rocket flight. The rocket ship is lifted by the magnet of a large crane and placed in the opening of the rocket cannon. After a moment of silence, a dazzling flash of light and a silent explosion occur, and then the rocket ship flies into the ether, which is represented by a large celestial canopy full of stars.

Education is "a great force standing between civilization and incineration," so it occupies an important place in the World's Fair, as if it were a Ministry of Education. Dr. Chase, President of New York University, serves as Chairman and directs everything.

The "Central Hall" area is decorated with many sculptures, fountains, and small waterfalls. Over 250,000 plants, special products from all over the world, are planted around it, connected to over a million famous flowers, creating a colorful, flower-filled paradise.

The authorities of the Fair anticipate that the total number of visitors in the spring and summer seasons will exceed 60 million. New York is the largest city in the world, and this fair is the largest World's Fair ever held.

### The Unique Features of the Fu Liancheng Opera School's Performances

— (Yan Yan)

The Fu Liancheng Opera School in Beijing was the first major opera school in the country, having cultivated countless talents. For example, Yu Lianquan (Xiao Changhua), Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Li Shengzao, Mao Shilai, etc., are all graduates of this school. When I was studying in Beijing in the past, I really enjoyed listening to the performances of this school because their performances did indeed have unique features that were unmatched by other privately organized troupes. Now that I have some free time, I am writing it down for the reference of people in Shanghai.

(1) The operas performed by Fu Liancheng every day are very substantial. They do not rely on star actors to attract audiences, but purely on the opera itself. Because the talent in the school is well-rounded, no opera uses a mediocre actor. They completely focus on having a well-matched cast and a lively performance.

(2) Every opera performed by Fu Liancheng is worth watching. From the opening act to the final act, there is no sense of being too high or too low. This is very different from other troupes, where the first three acts are unbearable.

(3) Fu Liancheng's operas emphasize rules and regulations. No laziness is allowed. Opera enthusiasts can fully enjoy themselves, and opera students can learn from them, making it a good example to follow.

(4) Fu Liancheng's martial operas have well-matched casts and are extremely tightly choreographed. Because of the large number of performers, the performances are lively and captivating, which is unmatched by any other opera troupe.

The above four points are the artistic advantages of the Fu Liancheng school. In addition, because the students in the school do not have huge salaries, the ticket prices are very low. This is also a characteristic of the opera school and cannot be achieved by privately organized troupes. Furthermore, the majority of Fu Liancheng's students are the sons of famous opera stars. The opera stars have extraordinary faith in the school, which shows the importance of the Fu Liancheng school in the Peking opera world.

### The Talented Child Star Hu Rongrong Recovering from Measles

— Zheng Yong

Starring in "Little Swordswoman" and "Mulan's Birth"

Seeing the continuous stream of Hollywood child star films, one cannot help but think of our own talented child stars who are worthy of cultivation. It is quite sad that since Shanghai became an isolated island, only the Starlight Company, which briefly shone last year, had a film starring the talented child star Hu Rongrong, "A Singer Saves Her Mother." This really makes movie fans yearn for entertainment and eagerly look forward. Currently, I suddenly heard that Guohua Company has invited Hu Rongrong to star in a new film, so I went to the Hu residence in Mingde Lane to inquire about it. Now I am sharing what I have learned through the "Entertainment World" corner to inform movie fans who care about child stars.

The Child Star Recovering from Measles

Rongrong's talent is much more intelligent and clever than other children, and her physique has always been healthy and beautiful. During the New Year this year, because her younger brother Zai Zai had measles, Rongrong, her younger sister Qianqian, and her younger brother Jiji were also infected and broke out in measles. However, the situation went very well, and they have now fully recovered. Their appetites have increased, and their spirits are still more lively than ordinary people. However, her father, Mr. Gui Fen, is still letting his beloved four children rest, temporarily not attending school, but reading books, writing, playing chess, and playing the accordion at home. Rongrong is also personally replying to the many letters from fans and mailing out the photos requested by fans.

"Little Swordswoman" Starts Filming First

As for the new film starring Rongrong, "Little Swordswoman" by Guohua Company, will start filming immediately, with singer Yi Qiuxia and others in supporting roles. Before deciding to shoot this film, around the end of last month, the Guohua authorities had discussed with her father about letting Rongrong star in "Mulan's Birth" before "Little Swordswoman." The script for this film was already written by Rongrong's elder brother Hu Xinling in early October last year. However, because the contract for "Little Swordswoman" had been signed for a long time and should be completed first, Guohua withdrew the new proposal and returned the script for "Mulan's Birth" to the Hu family for safekeeping, to be discussed again after "Little Swordswoman" is completed.

"Mulan's Birth" Educational Film

At that time, I asked Mr. Gui Fen whether the content of "Mulan's Birth" and "Mulan Joins the Army" was similar. Xinling showed me the original manuscript of the former, revealing that the two are fundamentally different. The content of "Mulan's Birth" tells the story of Mulan's childhood and contains a large amount of educational meaning. This script was written in early October last year. Zhang Shichuan of Guohua wanted to start filming it at that time, but he was worried about the time-consuming and costly preparation of ancient costumes, so he returned the original script to Hu Xinling and temporarily postponed the project. Now that the old matter has been brought up again and then stopped, the script for "Mulan's Birth" has been returned to the Hu family again.

### A Glimpse of Mao Shilai's Lineup

— Lü Gong

Zhang Eyun, Yang Shen, and others have performed for more than two golden months, and their contract will expire on May 7. The results have been remarkable and impressive, which must be attributed to the well-matched cast and the skillful arrangement. Following Zhang Eyun, Mao Shilai and others will arrive in Shanghai soon. The Golden Theater has decided to retain Yan Shishan, Guan Shengxi, and Xi Chanlian for another month in order to extract the essence of the fourth and fifth classes of Fu Liancheng and achieve the wonderful effect of complementing each other. Therefore, I am revealing their full lineup below, which I believe will also be welcomed by opera lovers.

Mao Shilai is 20 years old. When he performed at the Golden Theater last year, he gave Shanghai people a very good impression. The opera "Twelve Reds" has been absent from the opera stage for a long time, but it has been able to continue to exist thanks to Shilai. This is because when Liu was captured in this opera, he fell three times in a row, which is something that no one in the female roles today can do. Other operas such as "Heroes and Martyrs," "Little Shepherd," and "Ma Siyuan" have also been widely praised. After returning to Beijing, he worked even harder, practicing singing, practicing his skills, and discussing the operas every day with diligence. He also learned calligraphy and painting from the famous calligraphers and painters Yuan Tongshu and Chen Banding. Mr. Yuan said that Shilai's small regular script has a powerful and vigorous style, with the charm of Tang Dynasty scripture writing. In the Chang'an, Qingle, Xinxin, and Jixiang theaters, he has performed "Jin Ping Mei," "Yu Hu Tang," the full version of "Mu Guiying" (from "Shooting the Wild Goose" to "Tianmen Formation"), "Red Plum Pavilion," and other operas, which have had sold-out performances. This time when he comes to Shanghai, we should look at him with new eyes.

Gao Anglin is 24 years old, the second son of Gao Qingkui, and studies martial roles. He and Yang Shengchun are outstanding members of the fourth class. Shenglin has a loud and sweet voice. Tie Fan's "Midnight Run" and "Picking the Carriage" were personally taught by Xiao Lou and are by no means comparable to those who deceive the world with the Yang style. He was extremely popular in Beijing and Tianjin. He usually likes to draw face patterns for operas. Therefore, his face patterns in "Zhuangyuan Yin," "Si Ping," and "Yan Yang Lou" can be compared to those of his predecessors. His martial skills are also clean and healthy. Opera lovers praise him as a rising comet in the martial roles. This time he is returning with a good reputation, which can be expected in advance.

Sha Shixin is 20 years old. He and Lian Liang are both Muslims. His singing and acting are also excellent. He has a reputation as "Little Ma Lianliang." He excels in acting and wearing elaborate costumes. This is his first time in Shanghai and should give us a fresh impression.

Yan Shishan is 21 years old. This is his third time performing in Shanghai. Shanghai people have already given his art extremely high praise, regarding him as the leader of today's martial female roles. The Golden Theater loves his talent and has decided to retain him for another month. In the future, he will collaborate with Shilai on operas such as "Legend of the White Snake," "Fan Lihua," and "Juan Juan," which will surely cause a sensation in the entire city.

Jiang Shiyu is 22 years old, the son of Jiang Shunxian, and plays young male roles. He has a handsome appearance. After graduating, he studied operas such as "Elegant View Tower," "Exploring Zhuang," and "Flying Tiger Mountain" from the famous amateur performer Bao Danting. His art is already comparable to that of Ye Shenglan.

Ai Shiju is 22 years old and a rising star in the clown roles. Wu Zongye, Shengzhang, Nian Xiao is his teacher for Fu Lu. "Clever Coincidence," "Ci Bajie," and "Herding Cattle" are his masterpieces. The old opera lover Mr. Sun Luan praises him as unique in the clown roles.

Qiu Shengrong is 25 years old, the second son of the late famous Jing role Qiu Guixian. He is skilled in both the copper hammer and the frame. His singing and recitation have his father's charm. Recently, he has been increasingly motivated. His reputation in Beijing has the potential to follow in the footsteps of Jin Shaoshan.

Luo Gong is 28 years old, the eldest grandson of the late famous clown Luo Baisui. He plays civil clown roles, speaks coldly, and has a clear voice. He is also an outstanding member of the fourth class of the school.

Others, such as the solid old male role Guan Shengxi and the painted face Xu Xiaochen, as well as over twenty other civil and martial supporting roles, are all high-achieving graduates of the fourth and fifth classes of Fu Liancheng. They are talented in both civil and martial arts, and they are all gathered together. Once they perform, the Golden Theater will surely have another grand occasion.

The Use of the Body (Continued)

The Fourth Table of Body Positions

Regardless of which side, the first and second positions are commonly used by beginners, so it is essential to know them. The third and fourth positions must be used by advanced skaters. The ice skating patterns and techniques vary from person to person, but they all rely on changes in body position. The ways in which each person uses body position are different, and each pattern has several techniques. Each technique has its own advantages, so it cannot be said that one is necessarily superior or inferior. It all depends on which method is most suitable for the individual. Therefore, in the future, when encountering pattern techniques, we will either show one method or list several methods. This does not mean that there are no other methods besides the method shown, but we can only indicate the path. Readers should create their own variations and strive for accuracy and elegance in the patterns drawn on the ground, without violating the rules set by the International Skating Union. Because there are no fixed rules for techniques, it is best to learn all the different techniques and choose the one that is most suitable and convenient for you.

Various turning techniques all rely on changes in this body position. Therefore, if the various positions can be mastered thoroughly without omissions, progress will be rapid. Otherwise, you will encounter difficulties. Ordinary learners can usually handle the first and second positions on each side, but when it comes to doing four turns or changing sides, they do not know what to do with their hands and feet. This is because the body position is not only used in the first two positions, but is completely different from the usual posture. Therefore, if you do not practice the last two positions on each side, you will never be able to learn various turning techniques, and you will feel that none of the advanced patterns are easy to do. The main reason is the incorrect body position. Therefore, if you do not understand and practice them early, you will either give up halfway or waste your time.

### A Record of the Disturbance in Shanghai during the Third Year of Xianfeng

(See this newspaper, April of the eleventh year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)

During the third year of Xianfeng, bandits attacked the Shanghai County Office, releasing prisoners. They then proceeded to the Daotai Office, looting over four hundred thousand taels of gold from the treasury. Shortly thereafter, the bandits requested that the Observer [Daotai] enter the city. The Observer demanded three things from the bandits: first, hand over the ringleaders who murdered the officials; second, return the treasury gold; and third, surrender military weapons for disbandment. The bandits refused. The Observer then sealed his official seal and went to Jingkou to petition the Grand Coordinator. Initially, the troops under Commander Zhang Dianchen were mostly Cantonese and Chaozhou recruits. Stationed between Jinling and Jingkou, they repeatedly defeated enemy camps, accumulating great wealth through looting. People from their hometown envied them, and countless others came seeking to join. Suddenly, the Grand Commander was transferred to Sichuan, and the troops scattered and became bandits, using Shanghai as a refuge, increasing in number daily. At that time, there was a man named Zhou Lichun in Qingpu who resisted paying grain taxes and resisted arrest, recruiting and enticing various bandits to start an uprising, and colluded with the Taiping rebels in Jinling, attacking and capturing Jiading County. The people of Shanghai were in great panic. On the fifth day of the eighth month, seven hundred Cantonese soldiers stationed in the Inspectorate within Xiaodongdou betrayed and opened the city gates to the bandits, killing Magistrate Yao Mingfu and driving out the Observer and others. On that day, the bandits deployed to defend the city and also captured the four cities of Qingpu, Baoshan, Chuansha, and Nanhui. They attacked Taicang unsuccessfully. Fortunately, reinforcements sent by Rongzhi arrived. Within a few months, they recovered the five districts of Baoshan, Qingpu, Jiading, Chuansha, and Nanhui. Shanghai could not be completely besieged because the southwest, northeast corners bordered the foreign settlement. By the winter of the fourth year, the bandits' tactics were exhausted, and some advocated cutting off the bandits' supplies. Therefore, they negotiated with Westerners to build a long barricade from Xiaodongmen to Laobeimen. With the completion of the wall, the bandits became even more unsustainable. On New Year's Eve, the bandits fled in separate directions, east and west. On New Year's Day, government troops pursued westward to Hongqiao, joining with the local militia and annihilating them. After the success, the Westerners requested the area within the built wall as a concession. Since then, hills have gradually turned into grand buildings. Who would have known that the place of today's bright lights and lavish entertainment was once a battlefield of iron horses and golden spears; the place of buying laughter and enjoyment was once a devastated and scorched zone. This is the record.
