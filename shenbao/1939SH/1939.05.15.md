Gulangyu Completely Covered in Japanese Military Posts; Entire City in State of Terror, Municipal Council Unable to Exercise Police Authority; London Considers Situation Extremely Serious; Wang Chung-hui States That Japan is Testing Attitudes of Powers

(Fuzhou) After the Japanese naval landing force forcibly occupied Gulangyu, they conducted house-to-house searches in the city over the past two days. Chinese residents are unable to escape. Several hundred young people have already been taken to Xiamen, their fate unknown. The entire city is covered in Japanese military posts. The Municipal Council is unable to exercise its police authority. As a result, all the stores in the city are closed and in a state of terror. British and American residents are also in extreme fear. (Fourteenth Day Dispatch)

(Chongqing) Chinese and foreign reporters interviewed Foreign Minister Wang Chung-hui today, requesting his opinion on the recent actions of the Japanese in Southern China. He gave the following statement: The Japanese Consul in Gulangyu was originally a member of the Gulangyu Municipal Council. Now the Japanese army has landed in the Gulangyu concession without prior notification to the Municipal Council. This is intended to test the true attitudes of the powers towards the Far East and is a preliminary action by Japan to seize the Shanghai International Settlement and other areas in similar positions. Japan's contempt for the rights and interests of third countries is not a recent decision. Today we can say that if the powers wish their rights and interests not to be excluded from the Far East, their only strategy is to adopt sanctions and retaliatory measures against the Japanese aggressors. (Fourteenth Day Dispatch)

(London) According to news from here today, Britain considers Japan's occupation of Gulangyu and interference in the administration of the International Settlement to be extremely serious. The British government's attitude was stated in Parliament yesterday. Foreign Office officials also deeply fear that Japan may proceed to occupy the Shanghai International Settlement. The British government stated in Parliament yesterday that Britain does not consider the Japanese army's landing on Gulangyu to be a violation of Japan's treaty rights, provided it does not interfere in the administration of the settlement. Regarding the question of answering Japan's proposed amendments to the Shanghai Land Regulations, the British Foreign Office is still exchanging views with the US State Department. Although the British and American governments are currently studying this issue separately, because they are in close communication, the contents of the replies will necessarily be substantially the same.

Editorial

### The Alleged Sino-Soviet Secret Agreement

Psychologically, it is imitation; pathologically, it is contagion. Thus, there are always things that suddenly become popular with the times. Regarding the current European international situation, with its intricate plotting, scheming, and alliances for mutual benefit, it is thriving for a time. The lingering influence has even led some to claim that the Far East is following suit. As yesterday's newspaper reported, Reuters Tokyo reported that two newspapers published reports claiming China and the Soviet Union had concluded a secret agreement. We do not believe that China and the Soviet Union have been infected in this way. It is likely a bored person imitating the current trend and making a sensationalist speculation. Newspaper A claimed that the Soviet Union supplied China with pilots and mechanics in unlimited quantities, and also provided a loan of 400 million yuan for China to purchase military supplies, with 50 million yuan jointly establishing a Sino-Soviet arms import company in Wenzhou. Newspaper B claimed that the Soviet Union was demanding a price for its assistance to China in resisting Japan. The matter was negotiated by Sun Ke in Moscow, and what had been approved by Chairman Chiang included the following points: First, China must consult with Moscow before accepting mediation from any third country; second, China should absolutely eliminate all those in the National Government and other jurisdictions who advocate peace; third, China should ensure that the equipment and treatment of the Central Army, the Communist Army, and the armies of various provinces are uniform; fourth, designate the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang as special administrative regions, with Mao Zedong as chairman, garrisoned solely by the Communist Army, and the Soviet Union will be allowed to develop the resources of the three provinces and send a military officer as a military representative; fifth, China should hire Soviet experts as military training officers to train soldiers and pilots; sixth, open land and air routes between Xi'an and Moscow, via Lanzhou, Hami, and Dihua; and in exchange, the Soviet Union would provide China with unlimited material and technical assistance.

Given the limitations of time, we are unable to ascertain how the authorities of China and the Soviet Union will respond to this report; whether they will acknowledge it, deny it, or remain silent is all unknown. Let us analyze the report as it stands, and it can be seen that there is nothing that does not contradict reality and reason. The authorities of both countries will likely deem it not worth acknowledging because of its complete falsehood and its infantile absurdity. As we know and believe, since China launched a full-scale war of resistance, all countries except the aggressor have given China sympathy and assistance, not just the Soviet Union alone. The Soviet Union has long provided China with extensive material and technical assistance, not just starting now; it is based on morality and mutual trust, so there are no conditions and no secrets. The Soviet Union is rich in arms production but short of gold and silver, and what China expects from the Soviet Union is the former, not the latter, so there has never been any mention of a so-called loan; moreover, for direct transfers between governments, there is no need to allocate funds and establish a company. The two countries' air route between Chongqing and Moscow has already been publicly test-flown, so why is it necessary to demand it as a secret condition? All these points, in fact, in spirit, and in the nature of their implications, are higher than what the Eastern Daily claims; they are even more valuable. This is something that the Eastern Daily cannot measure or understand. As for the so-called hiring of experts, China has historically invited many foreign advisors, but this is an action taken independently by the government, not restricted by international treaties; China is fighting to resist aggression and to fight for freedom, and would not willingly sacrifice the freedom to hire experts to so-called secrets. Furthermore, to say that the three provinces are designated as special regions, with whom in charge, which army garrisoned, and which country has exclusive rights, is the desire of the aggressor, which does not apply to the Soviet Union; if the Eastern Daily expresses such a tone, is it not a case of the benevolent seeing benevolence and the wise seeing wisdom, and does it not have its own source? As for the so-called uniformity in the equipment and treatment of all armies, the Chinese military authorities have previously rejected this as a divisive statement; uniformity in treatment has been implemented for some time, but disparities in equipment are limited by reality; moreover, since the war of resistance, the troops are divided by region, not by so-called Central and Communist divisions; equipment is gradually enriched and improved as permitted by the actual situation, and this has nothing to do with region. All these points, not only can it be asserted that they are not true by refuting them with facts, but it can also be deduced from reason that the Chinese and Soviet sides would never make these secret conditions. As for not being able to accept mediation from other countries without first consulting with Moscow, and absolutely eliminating pro-peace factions, these are the tones of turncoat elements, whose words seem to express resentment towards the Soviet Union, but in reality, they seek to slander the Chinese government as being communist; imitation and contagion, interwoven with each other, are then taken as materials for proposing secret agreements.

Since there are contradictions in the international arena, there are also interests; since there are interests, there are also friends and enemies; since there are friends and enemies, there are either hostilities and wars, or alliances, or agreements, or secret agreements; each sees what is needed, and each takes what is appropriate. These are common practices and common methods, and there is nothing to be surprised at. Moreover, these so-called methods and patterns, although they will necessarily have their consequences, generally speaking, it is not so much that treaties create the situation, but rather that the situation creates treaties; for example, the Anglo-French alliance is the product of the union of Britain and France, not that the alliance made Britain and France unite; such as the German-Italian alliance, is the product of the union of Germany and Italy, not the alliance that made Germany and Italy unite; the Soviet Union, England and France, Japan, Germany and Italy, are the non-compliance of the road, is a combination of sound, today's distance, and the contract? From this point of view, the Sino-Soviet alliance, is not absolutely impossible, and that the English and French security after Poland and Romania, the Soviet Union in the West felt threatened by a slight slip, then in the East will be more actively reason more, that is, the Sino-Soviet Union of the same power to stabilize the Far East who, the conditions are also more prepared, is that the Sino-Soviet two countries or the scope of not only two countries, if in the near future, take a reasonable approach, by what important manifestation, what developments, are all not enough to be a strange phenomenon, still must be in the form of mutual, the principle of equality and freedom, is not like the East Daily's secret agreement, which can be asserted.

### National Production Conference Concludes; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Delivers Closing Address; Military Strength Depends on Successful Economic Recovery; Slave Production Enhances Power to Resist Aggression; Truck Assembly Plant to Be Established in Western China

(Chongqing) Yesterday, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a closing address to the National Production Conference, stating that the importance of this conference is like any military conference, because military strength depends on the success of the nation's economic recovery. He further stated that the efforts of the conference's representatives to increase national production have enhanced the power to resist enemy aggression. At the same time, Finance Minister Dr. Kong Xiangxi also gave a speech. The plans discussed at the conference included the following items: 1. Develop and promote small-scale industries; 2. Construct light railways; 3. Find ways to bring trained workers from Japanese-occupied areas to areas currently under the control of the Chinese government; 4. In order to assist guerrillas in continuing their resistance against Japanese aggression, efforts will be made to develop cooperatives and other small-scale industries in Japanese-occupied areas. A representative of the conference told the Associated Press that the most unique contribution of the decision conference was the establishment of a new truck assembly plant in Western China. The capital of the plant will be 500,000 yuan, and it is expected to produce 40 trucks per month. The work of the plant will be assembly, and all parts will be purchased from American manufacturers. In the past, China purchased assembled trucks from American companies such as General Motors and Dodge, which consumed a great deal of money. The decision of the conference to establish an assembly plant will definitely save the government a lot of money. (Fourteenth Day Associated Press Dispatch)

### President Kong's Opening Speech

(Chongqing) The National Production Conference opened in Chongqing on the 7th. President Kong personally attended and delivered an opening speech. The full text is as follows:

Esteemed members, the opening date of this production conference was originally scheduled for the 5th, which is the day eight years ago when the Prime Minister took office as the Extraordinary President, with the intention of learning from the Prime Minister's arduous struggle in those years, and devoting ourselves to the current major undertaking of production and construction. However, due to the Japanese reckless bombing of our rear areas, transportation within the city was difficult, so it was slightly delayed. Today's meeting coincides with the anniversary of the National Humiliation of May 7th, which is the day when Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands to Yuan Shikai. We recall the difficulties in the creation of the country, feel the tyranny of our current situation, and cherish the heavy responsibility of the future. Under the two major goals of resisting aggression and building the nation today, our duty is to continuously review and continuously encourage. The convening of the National Production Conference is based on this opportunity. During the war of resistance, this is more important than other gatherings, and its significance is particularly profound. The material supplies required for the war of resistance are vast, and the key to winning or losing depends on whether the economy and material resources can be sustained for a long time. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "Modern warfare is a final match between the human, physical, and financial resources of countries, and those whose economy and material resources can provide sustainable supplies will win the final victory." For more than a year, the Japanese have done everything possible to destroy China's economy and finances. Fortunately, with the efforts of the government and the enthusiastic maintenance of the people, economic construction in the interior can still continue, and the credit of the legal tender is becoming more and more consolidated. Recently, the price of counterfeit currency in North China has plummeted repeatedly. Although the Japanese have used various means to try to salvage it, they have ultimately been helpless. It must be known that counterfeit currency and Japanese currency are the same set of ghosts. The tragic fall in the price of counterfeit currency is equivalent to the tragic fall in the price of Japanese currency. Judging from this, China has already defeated the Japanese in the economic field. If we can continue to work hard, strive for production, and continuously supply and continuously strengthen our material and financial resources, then the war of resistance will surely win, and the construction of the country will not be difficult to achieve.

### Indiscriminate Bombing by Japanese Planes Provokes Strong Protest from the U.S.; Intended to Draw Attention of Congress and Public Opinion; Further Air Raids on Undefended Cities Will Accelerate Ban on Trade with Japan

(Chongqing) The China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement, in order to make the world's public more aware of the brutality of the Japanese invasion and to promote sanctions against Japan, has wired the Anti-Aggression League in Geneva, detailing the reality of the Japanese air raids on Chongqing.  It particularly pointed out that the despicable tactics of the Japanese are a manifestation of their increasingly weakened position. Such tactics are not only ineffective, but also deepen the understanding of the Chinese people of the cruel face of the Japanese, further fueling the popular spirit of shared hatred and determination to resist to the end. The branch also urged the League to find ways to promote the implementation of various proposals of the Paris Anti-Bombing of Undefended Cities Conference and to strengthen effective sanctions against Japan by various countries. (14th Telegram)

(Washington)  Relations between the United States and Japan have apparently suffered another blow due to reports of indiscriminate bombing of Chinese cities and towns by Japan. According to a message revealed yesterday by U.S. Secretary of State Hull, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, has been instructed by the State Department to lodge a strong verbal protest with the Japanese Foreign Ministry, based on humanitarian grounds, against the Japanese air raids on Chongqing, Shantou, Ningbo, and Fuzhou.  According to Hull, this protest is fully in line with the United States' abhorrence of bombing defenseless civilians, women, and children, as most of the cities bombed by the Japanese are undefended and without significant military targets.  At the same time, the reason for the United States' protest is to draw the attention of the U.S. Congress and American public opinion to the brutal bombing by the Japanese.  It is claimed that the death toll of Chinese civilians in the Japanese bombing of Chongqing last week reached as many as 7,000. According to observers here, if Japan continues to bomb undefended cities, the U.S. Congress will accelerate its ban on trade with Japan, thus depriving Japan of more than 50% of the supplies for its war of aggression against China.  It is noted that U.S.-Japan relations have been strained due to Japan's continued destruction of American interests in China, its further demand for amendments to the Shanghai Land Regulations, its recent occupation of Gulangyu in the Xiamen International Settlement, its disregard for various U.S. protests, and its continued expansion southward, threatening the Philippines. All these actions have contributed to the poor impression of Japan in the U.S. officialdom. (14th, Associated Press)

(Washington) Secretary Hull recently issued a statement to the newspapers, saying that after Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing, Shantou, Ningbo, and Fuzhou, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, was instructed by the State Department to lodge a verbal protest with the Japanese government. Ambassador Grew has not yet reported on how the Japanese government responded. The State Department's instructions were based on its consistent attitude, namely, that the U.S. government condemns all acts of bombing ordinary people. In addition, regarding the Gulangyu incident in China, the U.S. Consul there, McVeitty, recently reported by telegram that after the assassination of the "Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce" in Xiamen City, 150 Japanese Marines occupied the Gulangyu International Settlement and arrested people everywhere. It is still unknown how the Consul is negotiating with the Japanese authorities. (13th, Havas Agency)

### After Repeated Tragic Bombings: Chongqing Municipal Government's Reorganization Plan; Clearing Disaster Areas, Rectifying the City's Appearance; Continuing Evacuation of the Elderly, Weak, Women and Children

(Chongqing)  Your correspondent visited a responsible official on the 14th to inquire about the relief situation for the disaster victims in Chongqing and the future reorganization plan for the municipal government. The official replied that after the Japanese planes indiscriminately bombed the city on the 3rd, 4th, 12th, and 13th of this month, the supreme leader immediately ordered the government to allocate huge sums of money for emergency relief. At the same time, he ordered Party, government, and military agencies to organize service teams, concentrate vehicles and ships, and actively transport citizens away from the disaster areas.  Within the five, six, and seven days, the number of citizens evacuated, according to statistics, had reached about 250,000.  Afterwards, the number of citizens who took free boats and left one after another on their own is not included in this figure. After the citizens were evacuated to safe areas such as [omitted], the service teams either found houses for them and lodged them in residents' homes, or guided them to temporary shelters set up by the government.  The equipment for their food, medicine, and security has also been properly arranged in an orderly manner, which is very convenient for the citizens.  Chongqing is the wartime capital of China, so Commander-in-Chief Liu specially transferred a certain unit of the army to join the service teams of various agencies, and under the command of Chief of Staff He, actively cleared the disaster areas and rectified the city's appearance. However, in order to reduce unnecessary sacrifices, the government should continue to work hard to evacuate the elderly, weak, women, and children, as well as various agencies that do not need to stay in Chongqing. As for the areas near Chongqing, those who cannot leave Chongqing due to production or job reasons will be investigated and registered by the authorities, issued certificates, and strictly organized into Baojia [a system of neighborhood control] with leaders assigned to them, so that the citizens staying in Chongqing can carry out their business and work as usual in an organized and planned manner. After the new mayor He Guoguang takes office, there should be more active measures on the municipal administration of Chongqing, the wartime capital, in the future. Under the guidance and supervision of the supreme leader, the orderliness of social order, the solemn atmosphere, and the tension of the work of civil servants and ordinary citizens in this wartime capital are all within expectations. (14th Telegram)

### He Guoguang to Take Office Today

(Chongqing) He Guoguang is scheduled to take office as Mayor of Chongqing on the morning of the 15th and concurrently as Deputy Commander of the Chongqing Garrison. He will still hold his original position as Director of the Chairman's Chengdu Headquarters, and his duties will be handled by Senior Staff Officer Liu Yiren. (14th Telegram)

(Chongqing) It is reported that the Wei Li Han Company's warehouse on the south bank of the Yangtze River was destroyed during the sudden air raid by Japanese planes last Friday. The warehouse contained 400,000 yuan worth of tobacco and several cigarette-making machines worth thousands of dollars. (13th, U.S. Associated Press)

### Japanese Planes Shot Down; Seven Found

(Chongqing) Today, the authorities transported three Japanese aircraft shot down near Chongqing on May 3 to the Central Park for exhibition. When the coolies transported the remaining parts of the three aircraft to the Central Park, the crowd lined up and followed behind. According to the Chinese authorities, a total of eleven Japanese aircraft were shot down by the Chinese side on May 3 and 4, of which seven have been found. All the shot-down Japanese aircraft were manufactured in Italy or Germany, and the machine guns inside were British Vickers. The three Japanese aircraft exhibited in the Central Park were all shot down by Chinese fighter planes, as many machine gun holes can still be seen in the fuselage. Furthermore, according to several Chinese people, the bodies of Italian pilots were found in many of the downed Japanese aircraft, but this has not yet been confirmed. Today, senior Chinese authorities declared that two of the three Japanese aircraft shot down on Friday night have been found. Foreign observers said that the three aircraft (i.e., the Japanese aircraft shot down on Friday night) were clearly shot down by anti-aircraft guns, at least one of which has been conclusively proven. The misbombing of Jiangfu and Tanchizi (transliterations) by Japanese aircraft that night (Friday night) was actually due to the effective intensive firing of Chinese anti-aircraft guns. Initially, 27 Japanese aircraft flew in formation from the north, but because the sky was dark and it was difficult to find targets, they dispersed the formation and flew low in order to find their targets, resulting in flying into the range of the anti-aircraft guns and three being shot down. (13th, Associated Press)

### British Ambassador Bedridden in Chengdu

(Chongqing) Today, a counselor at the British Embassy told an Associated Press reporter that British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, caught a cold while in Chengdu and is now bedridden at home, unable to go to the embassy to work. It is said that last Monday, when Ambassador Kerr was in Chengdu, officials of the province held a banquet to welcome him. Before the banquet ended, an air raid alarm occurred, so Chinese officials insisted on asking him to take shelter temporarily in the open fields outside the city. As a result, the Japanese aircraft did not come, but Ambassador Kerr and Chinese officials stood in the suburbs all night. A few days later, he suddenly had alternating chills and fever, and was bedridden, unable to work. (13th, Associated Press)

### Russians Arrested Near Guangzhouwan

(Hong Kong) According to reports from China received here today, four Russians were arrested near Guangzhouwan on suspicion of espionage. According to Chinese reports, the description of the four prisoners suggests that they may be the four people who sailed a small boat from Shanghai to Manila, but were blown to Hong Kong by a storm one month ago. They left here on April 17 to continue their voyage to Manila. According to reports, after being arrested, they told the authorities that they were sailing to Siam and were lost due to the big waves.

### European Anti-Aggression Front Nearing Completion; Mussolini Advocates Peace, Saying European Issues Not Enough to Cause War; Desires Towards France Still Expressed Through Audience's Slogans

Turin: Premier Mussolini delivered a speech here at the Piazza 爱麦虞限 at eleven o'clock this morning, saying that ten years ago, I delivered a speech here and concluded, "Advance, build, and, if necessary, fight!" Since then, the Italian people have taken these words as their guide and moved forward, fighting in Africa, breaking away to deal with the sanctions of the League of Nations, and recently fighting in Spain, thus creating the Italian Empire, annexing Albania, and becoming stronger in all aspects. Today, the question before us is one of peace or war. "After reviewing the current situation with an objective attitude, I dare to answer that the various problems in Europe, both in importance and urgency, are not enough to cause a war. The crux of the European political situation must be resolved, and even this does not require resorting to arms. This is the view of Italy, and so is Germany. As for the friendship between Germany and Italy, the military and political agreement agreed upon by the two authorities in Milan the other day will be signed in Berlin at the end of this month. The closer our cooperation with Germany, the more we can lay the foundation for peace in Europe based on justice to fulfill the hope of the people of all countries. Regarding this, foreign people often talk about strategy in cafes, and their absurdity is not worth laughing at." (The audience shouted slogans such as "We demand Nice, Savoy, Tunisia.") "The democracies speak of peace, but it is doubtful whether we sincerely desire peace. Germany, Italy, and Japan have never occupied an inch of land of the major democracies. If these democracies sincerely desire peace, why are they conducting an "economic war" against Germany, Italy, and Japan? If these democracies think that war can be won with gold, it is a great mistake. It should be known that the way to win relies on determination and courage. Germany and Italy have a population of 150 million, and the number is increasing. We have now formed a great group from the Baltic Sea to the Indian Ocean, and we will never allow other countries to control us. The situation created by the Treaty of Versailles has collapsed, and the mutual guarantee measures of various countries must also fail. It is under these circumstances that we are expanding our military preparations day by day in order to maintain our peace and resist all possible aggressions. The Italian people and the political system they have established have now become an inseparable system." (14th, Havas)

Turin: Italian Premier Mussolini delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the Self-Sufficiency Exhibition here today, saying that after an objective review of the current situation, he felt that there were no major or acute problems in Europe at present that were sufficient to cause a war. Our unwillingness for peace is only due to the many disasters in our internal situation. May I ask the major democracies to express fair opinions on our views? There are tens of millions of people who are asking us whether we are heading towards peace or war. This is indeed a difficult question for anyone to answer, especially for those who are responsible for deciding peace and war. There are certain knots in Europe that do not need to be untied with a knife, but must be untied immediately, because sometimes it feels better to have a war than to be trapped in difficulties and indecision for a long time. Italy and Germany now share this belief. The indomitable nature of Fascism is now even greater. We will take the same steps as Germany on all European issues to give peace to Europe with justice. Mussolini also asked sarcastically, "Can the major democracies match Italy's sincere desire for peace? We should express doubts about this, because the lack of sincerity of the democracies towards peace can be seen in the fact that they have already launched the so-called "white war" in the economic field. War is not only won by gold. We will defeat it with courage and willpower." Mussolini also said that the short-barreled system created by Versailles has failed, and it is expected that the guarantee system will also collapse. Who dares to have any doubts about the future? No matter what happens, he dares to declare that all of our goals will be achieved one by one. It is noteworthy that Mussolini's speech did not mention Danzig, Poland, the Anglo-Turkish treaty, or Italy's demands on France. (14th, Reuters)

### Good Impression in Britain

(London) Reuters has learned that diplomatic circles here have a good impression of Mussolini's speech. Everyone feels that Mussolini's tone is peaceful and gentle, and the general atmosphere has not been adversely affected by Mussolini's speech. (14th, Reuters)

### Signs of Revival of the League of Nations; Covenant to be Amended

(London) Regarding the issue of amending the Covenant of the League of Nations, political figures here recently stated that the amendment plan was recently proposed by the Soviet Union and Turkey, and its content is more active than previously reported. According to this plan, the current organization of the Executive Council must be thoroughly changed. The permanent directors, who were originally held by the major powers, will in the future be held by "active" member states that accept mutual aid obligations. Other member states, who wish to strictly maintain neutrality, may also be elected as directors, but they will be elected. The distribution of these directors will still be based on geographical relations. For example, the countries of Latin America, the Balkan Consultation, and the Scandinavian Islands can each obtain these director seats. In addition, the staff departments of the "active" member states, that is, the permanent director states of the Executive Council, should also be in constant contact so that they can promptly dispatch naval, land, and air forces at the disposal of the League of Nations. In this way, when the League of Nations wants to make major decisions to implement its principles, the "neutral countries" will be powerless to delay or obstruct it. As for the detailed content of this plan, it is said that it will be formally submitted for discussion at the League of Nations General Assembly in September of this year. (14th, Havas)

### Germany Says Danzig Issue Can Be Resolved Later; Germany and Italy Are Uneasy About Mutual Assistance Agreements

(Berlin) The establishment of the Anglo-Turkish alliance and the ongoing Anglo-Soviet negotiations, with the aim of organizing an anti-aggression front, are now causing anxiety in Germany. Newspapers express regret that Turkey has been tempted by Britain, saying that Anglo-German understanding can only be based on a strict demarcation of areas of interest. Germany's rights over Danzig, even if they conflict with British diplomacy, must eventually be realized. The solution to this problem can be postponed, but not prevented. (14th, Reuters)

(Paris) Diplomatic figures here recently declared that now that Britain and Turkey have decided to conclude a mutual assistance agreement and the Soviet Union's participation in the collective security system is undoubtedly confirmed, the diplomatic activities of the dictatorships are therefore limited. The German diplomatic authorities are now making every effort to urge the Nordic countries and the Baltic coast countries to conclude non-aggression pacts with them. Among the Nordic countries, only Denmark and Finland believe that it is possible to negotiate an agreement, but it must also be based on the principles recently reiterated by the meeting of foreign ministers of the Nordic countries, that is, it must be established under the conditions of absolute neutrality. As for the Baltic coast countries, Latvia and Estonia seem to be prepared to sign a non-aggression pact with Germany, the nature of which should be the same as that signed by those countries with the Soviet Union. On the contrary, Lithuania is obviously closer to Poland. In addition, although Germany and Italy have been very active in the Black Sea region, they have achieved nothing. Italy's attempts to win over Yugoslavia have also had no concrete results. Therefore, Germany and Italy may once again adopt the old method of promoting relations with countries that sympathize with the Axis policy on the one hand, and gradually expanding their influence on other countries, that is, on countries that are impartial to both the German-Italian Axis and the Anglo-French group, in terms of economics and propaganda. As for the relationship between Germany, Italy, and Japan, although Germany and Italy have decided to conclude a military treaty, the Japanese government seems to be increasingly reluctant to accept the idea of extensive military obligations. In addition, there is no sign of Germany and Italy concluding an alliance treaty with Spain, and the economic advantages that Germany can obtain in Romania have been offset by the establishment of the Anglo-Romanian commercial agreement. Germany is now still trying to win over Bulgaria and is engaged in cultural activities in Yugoslavia (there are now 500,000 Germans in Yugoslavia). This propaganda work is obviously intended to supplement the inadequacy of diplomatic activities. In short, the Axis countries, especially Germany, are engaged in vigorous diplomatic activities, but due to the active involvement of Britain and France, their scope of activities is becoming increasingly narrow. (14th, Havas) Warsaw: Polish newspapers transported to Danzig are now being confiscated again, even the official Bolska newspaper is among them. The rumor that Poland has issued a communique warning Germany that if there is a coup attempt in Danzig, Poland will resist it with force is denied by officials here, saying that no such communique has been issued in the past few days. According to news from here today, the glass windows of many Polish shops and houses in Danzig were smashed last night. Polish newspapers criticize the Danzig City Council, saying that it is taking a provocative attitude and cannot control the situation. The Bolska newspaper said that the Poles have found evidence of its malice in the attitude of the Danzig City Council, which clearly shows that the Council wants to provoke a conflict between the Poles and the residents of Danzig. (14th, Reuters)

Warsaw: The 28th of this month is the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule in the Free City of Danzig. Informed sources here commented on the rumor that the city authorities plan to hold a referendum on that day, saying that if Germany unilaterally changes the current legal status of Danzig or takes violent actions, Poland will regard it as an act of aggression and will do its best to deal with it. This is also approved by Britain and France, as can be seen from the speeches delivered by Prime Minister Chamberlain and Premier Daladier the other day. Once Danzig or any place related to the territorial integrity of Poland is indeed threatened, Poland will request assistance from Britain and France, and those countries will immediately implement the guarantee conditions. It can be asserted that the referendum planned by the authorities of the Free City of Danzig is only of a propaganda nature and is not necessarily related to the incorporation of the city into Germany. Its intention is probably to find out whether Nazism has the support of the majority of citizens, so it will not involve the current legal status of Danzig, and Poland will not need to react strongly.

### Soviet Union and Britain Eager to Conclude Agreement Soon; However, Still Insisting on a Three-Country Military Commitment; Germany and Italy Also Actively Courting Spain

Kovno: According to newspaper reports, relations between the Soviet Union and the Baltic states have now been strengthened. Soviet Foreign Minister Potemkin will visit the Baltic states after the League of Nations conference, and will soon appoint a new minister to Lithuania, as Lithuania has not had a Soviet minister stationed there for more than a year. (14th, Reuters)

(London) The Berlin correspondent of the Sunday Times claims that one of the results of the Anglo-Turkish agreement is that Germany and Italy are enthusiastically courting Spain behind the scenes to join the Berlin-Rome Axis. Since the end of the Spanish Civil War, German writers have been writing articles exaggerating Spain's military strength and its strategic importance. However, so far, Spain has only a cultural agreement with Germany, apart from being a member of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Observers here believe that Germany and Spain will continue to sign a military alliance, and at the same time, it is expected that the economic relations between Germany and Spain will become closer due to the signing of a new commercial agreement. According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Observer, there are now various signs indicating that the Soviet Union will, without waiting for the meeting of British Foreign Secretary Halifax, French Foreign Minister Bonnet, and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin in Geneva next week, telegraph its observations on Britain's recent proposals to London. It is said that the main driving force behind Moscow's move is the continued concern about the danger of delay. In view of the Soviet Union's eagerness to reach a compromise with Britain as soon as possible, it is said that the Soviet government will express its readiness to accept the revised method, but will reaffirm its will to insist that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must establish a firm military commitment and publicly express that it will resist any further acts of aggression by Germany. (14th, Reuters)

Turkish Capital: Turkish newspapers have published long articles praising the value of the Anglo-Turkish agreement and calling it the most important political development in some time. It also said that the government wisely abandoned its policy of neutrality and joined the democratic front because of Britain's sincerity in seeking peace. However, Turkey still intends to remain neutral and engage with other countries to protect the world's security. Now, if one considers the treatment of the Balkan neighbors by those dictatorships, which has endangered Turkey's security, then Turkey has no choice but to adopt a plan required by the environment. The Turkish people are the most loyal friends when they are on an equal footing, but they cannot tolerate being shackled by others. It concludes that the Anglo-Turkish agreement greatly enhances the confidence of the entire Balkans. (14th, Reuters)

### Military Alliance of Italy and Germany Scheduled to be Signed by the End of This Month; Japan Has Declined to Participate

(Berlin) According to reliable sources, Germany and Italy's request to sign a military alliance treaty has been rejected by Japan. The reasons are threefold: (1) Japan's main interests lie in the Far East; (2) Japan has no reason to antagonize any democratic countries; and (3) Japan maintains significant trade relations with various democratic countries. Even from an economic standpoint, it is inconvenient to sign a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)

(Berlin) According to well-informed sources here, the recently concluded German-Italian military alliance will be signed in Berlin before the end of this month, possibly on May 20. (Haitong dispatch of the 14th)

(Paris) A correspondent in Rome for Le Matin reports that German leader Hitler has personally drafted a treaty on political and military affairs between Germany and Italy and sent it to the Italian government via the Italian ambassador to Germany, Attolico, last night. The treaty is reportedly valid for ten years and contains eight articles, which can be revised at any time based on implementation experience within those ten years. Regarding the military aspect, the significant points include three items: (1) If war breaks out in Europe in the future, regardless of whether one of the signatory countries or a third party is involved, both governments must immediately consult with each other. The person responsible for this consultation will be determined in a separate secret protocol; (2) The interests of Germany and Italy are closely related. If war breaks out and one of the signatory countries is directly involved, the land forces of both sides will be unified under a single command and form a joint force based on a unified military strategy; (3) In future external operations, neither signatory country may independently cease hostilities without the consent of the other party, to avoid situations where a truce or peace is signed unilaterally without notification. Regarding the political aspect, in addition to reaffirming the principles of the Rome-Berlin Axis, there are two additional clauses: (1) Each signatory country shall respect the friendly relations maintained by the other party with other countries based on existing treaties or existing understandings; (2) Neither party shall sign any new agreements with external parties without mutual consultation. It is reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will offer his opinions on this draft as soon as he arrives in Turin. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)

### England, France, and Other Countries Will Lend Spain 20 Million Pounds

(Brussels) According to reliable sources, a number of banks in England, France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands plan to lend the Spanish government a substantial sum of 20 million pounds. Former Belgian Prime Minister Theunis will be entrusted to go to Spain to negotiate and secure some guarantees. Once an agreement in principle is reached, Theunis will depart.

### Hitler Inspects Border Defenses

(Munich) Hitler has left and gone to Nuremberg to inspect the new building of the National Socialist Party's congress hall, which is under construction. His whereabouts afterwards are currently unknown, but it is believed he will inspect the defensive works along Germany's western border. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

(Aachen, Western Germany) Hitler, along with the head of the political police, Himmler, and the head of the State Council Intelligence Office, Diedrich, arrived here this morning. They were accompanied by the commander of the Second Army, General Wilhelm Keitel, and the Inspector General of Fortifications, General Jakob, to inspect the border defense works.

### Japan's Labor Shortage; Youth Aged 16-17 to be Conscripted; Spring Plowing Season Arrives with No One to Farm; Korean Farmers Also to be Imported

(Tokyo) Asahi Shimbun reports that the Ministry of Health and Welfare has decided to invoke Article 4 of the National General Mobilization Law to conscript labor to engage in businesses necessary for national mobilization. It is expected that an imperial ordinance will be promulgated by the end of June at the latest. Article 4 of the National General Mobilization Law stipulates, "When national general mobilization is necessary during wartime, the government will, in accordance with imperial ordinances, conscript imperial subjects to engage in general mobilization businesses." According to Chugai Commercial News, this ordinance aims to mobilize five million young people aged 16 to 17. These young people will serve in mobilization businesses under government control, and their wages will be the same as those earned before conscription. This plan will be handled by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

(Tokyo) Japan is a rice-eating country. Now that the spring plowing season has arrived, there is a severe shortage of labor due to the Sino-Japanese War. Based on the recommendations of various experts, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has adopted a method of importing thousands of Korean farmers. This method is unprecedented in Japanese history. The reasons for the severe shortage of rural population in Japan are: first, many farmers have been conscripted to fight in China; second, farmers are attracted by the high wages of munitions factories, rushing to them without hesitation. At the same time, due to the extreme shortage of labor in rural areas, wages have reached a height not seen in fifty years. This can also be called a revolution in Japan's internal economy. In the past, due to the surplus of agricultural labor, farmers were often in a state of starvation. Manufacturers, also due to the surplus of labor, could arbitrarily suppress prices. As a result, farmers' children had to go to the city to work for only a few yuan, and daughters were often sold, or sold to capitalists for 300 yuan. The reason why Japanese goods could expand to the world market in the past due to the low wages and small production in Japan. Also, the manipulation of prices by Japanese speculators has been controlled by Japan. For example, the world's largest rice exchange is now completely controlled by the government, and the speculative atmosphere has been reduced. Japan's food supply relies on imports from abroad for only 1% to 2.5% each year, so people here are proud of this, believing that if a major war breaks out, Japan can return to an era of self-imposed isolation, because Japan's land can provide for itself. However, Japan's shortage of rice may increase its imports from its colonies. At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's proposal to import foreign labor will greatly affect its domestic economic system, because those affected will not be limited to farmers, but also industrialists and merchants. What industrialists here are most concerned about is that this labor shortage will continue forever, because Japanese Army Minister Itagaki recently said in parliament that Japan will station troops in China indefinitely. Therefore, Japan's agricultural panic in the future may become a trigger for the gradual outbreak of many unfavorable situations in the Japanese economy. (Associated Press dispatch of the 14th)

### Siam's Predicament: Between a Rock and a Hard Place; How Will Siam Cope If War Breaks Out?

(Bangkok) A Siamese newspaper stated, "After the outbreak of a world war, Siam must remain neutral. When neutrality is impossible, a crucial decision must be made. What shall guide us in making this important decision? That is the question. Shall we make a decision after consulting public opinion? Unfortunately, what can small countries do that are located in war zones or in strategically important areas such as Singapore, Aden, and Gibraltar? They will inevitably be forced by circumstances to help one side and be drawn into the battlefield. Although Siam wants to remain neutral, in a world war, there is no other way but to join one side or the other. If so, the point of contention is which side Siam should join? If Japan colludes with Germany and Italy, intending to destroy Singapore and control the entire Far East, Siam's assistance will be needed by Japan. Some observers believe that if the difficulties that Siam envisions within the colonial empires of England and France in alliance with Italy and Japan do not materialize, wouldn't Siam be in an unpleasant position? Today, Siam's position is truly difficult. Siam has British Burma to the west, French Vietnam to the east, and British Malaya to the south. In recent years, Japan has been very attentive to Siam, but since the Japanese invasion of China, Siam has become suspicious of Japan. Therefore, it is generally believed that England's influence in Siam is as strong as ever. Siam spends a great deal on national defense. Although its army, navy, and air force are small in size and quality, they should not be underestimated in a major war." (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

### British King and Queen Encounter Fog Mid-Journey; Arrival in Canada Postponed

(Ottawa) The Empress of Australia encountered fog in the Atlantic Ocean and was unable to arrive on schedule. Therefore, officials announced today that the British King and Queen's visit to Ottawa will be postponed by three days. The government committee preparing the tour is currently revising the program and will announce its revised plan as soon as it knows when the Empress of Australia will arrive in Quebec. According to a radio message from the Empress of Australia to the Reuters correspondent on board, the ship had to reverse twice yesterday due to encountering ice floes and discovered a very large iceberg about a quarter of a mile away in one location. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

(Ottawa) Prime Minister Mackenzie King declared to the House of Commons today that the "Empress of Australia," carrying King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, encountered fog and icebergs in the ocean, making navigation difficult, and will not arrive at Quebec Harbor until the 16th of this month (originally scheduled for the 15th). The reception program will not be changed as a result, but the King and Queen's originally scheduled four-day stay in this city has been reduced to three days. This reception program has been in preparation for nearly a year, and everything is extremely detailed. The King's one-day delay almost overturned the entire original plan. However, the Canadian government decided to reduce the King's stay in Ottawa by one day and has already telegraphed the King to obtain his approval. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)

### United States Coal Mine Strike Resolved; 300,000 Workers Return to Work Today

(New York) More than 300,000 coal miners in the Appalachian coal mines, after going on strike three weeks ago, have signed a new contract today through the mediation of President Roosevelt, and the strike has been resolved. All striking workers are scheduled to return to work on the 15th of this month. This new two-year contract is based on the original contract but includes a new clause allowing all miners to join the Miners' Union. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)

### No American Munitions or Airplanes are Being Shipped to Japan

(Washington) According to statistics released by the State Department, American munitions and airplane exports in April totaled $6,712,008, but none were shipped to Japan. Of this amount, $2,557,907 was shipped to England, $1,320,771 was shipped to the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies, $1,108,703 was shipped to France, and $197,475 was shipped to China. The majority of these shipments consisted of airplanes and parts. In addition, the total value of munitions and airplane export licenses issued by the State Department in April was $3,926,805, and none were for shipments to Japan. Of this amount, airplanes and parts destined for the Netherlands accounted for $1,186,616, and shipments to England, France, Turkey, and Brazil were also included. Airplanes and parts destined for China accounted for $288,987. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)

(Washington) The US government announced yesterday that in April, the State Department did not issue a single passport for military equipment destined for Japan. However, permits were granted for shipments to Germany totaling US$528 and to Italy totaling US$9,500. The total value of military equipment purchased by other countries in the United States was less than US$4 million. In the first three months of this year, the average was US$9 million per month. Since May 1, the US government has approved export licenses worth more than US$37 million, mainly for purchases by France and England, mostly for military aircraft and aircraft equipment. The French and British orders for aircraft have reached US$25 million. (Associated Press dispatch of the 14th)

### The United States is Developing an Air Base on Puerto Rico; Transforming it into the "Hawaii of the Atlantic"; Naval Chief of Staff to be Appointed Governor

(Washington) According to responsible sources, the U.S. Army and Navy are preparing to spend more than $30 million to transform the island of Puerto Rico in the West Indies into an air base, making it a fortress in the Atlantic, like Hawaii in the Pacific. Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States by Spain after the Spanish-American War in 1898. It is 100 miles long and has an average width of 39 miles, with an area of 3,435 square miles. The governor of the island is appointed by the U.S. President and assisted by six cabinet members. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

(New York) Rear Admiral Leahy, Chief of Naval Operations, was appointed Governor of Puerto Rico by President Roosevelt yesterday. The New York Evening Post recently published a dispatch from a Washington correspondent stating that the Army and Navy will allocate $30 million to establish a strong naval and air force base in the Caribbean Sea. The detailed plan is being studied by the authorities and is reportedly to be implemented by Rear Admiral Leahy in the future. According to this plan, if the Panama Canal Zone is invaded by a certain European country, the United States can use destroyers and bombers with extremely long ranges to fly from the Caribbean Sea base to provide support. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)

(New York) Regarding the air force expansion plan, the New York Times recently reported that the chairman of the Joint Committee, the Director of the Civil Aeronautics Authority, Lee Ang, has submitted the first report to President Roosevelt. In addition to describing the current situation, he also stated that the United States should possess the world's strongest air force. The current number of workers employed by American aircraft manufacturers is 40,000, and this number should be increased to 60,000 in order to complete the Air Force Expansion Act (the main point of which is to allocate $37.6 million to build 3,532 aircraft, thereby increasing the total number of Army aircraft to 6,000) on schedule. The report also outlined various measures to enable factories to train a large number of workers effectively to meet wartime needs. It is also understood that the committee will submit a second report explaining "Continental Defense" and the government's subsidization of the development of various civil aviation routes.

### Border Conflict Occurs in Bulgaria; 23 Bulgarians Killed

(London) Bulgaria is greatly angered after receiving news that Romanian gendarmes killed 23 Bulgarians on the southern border of Blagoevgrad. According to the Romanian side, some Bulgarians crossed the border and attacked Romanian villages, so they were detained by Romanian gendarmes. When they were passing through a forest, gunshots were suddenly heard. The Romanian gendarmes believed that Bulgarian soldiers were attacking, so they opened fire in self-defense, killing 23 Bulgarians. The Romanian embassy in Bulgaria is now being guarded by troops to prevent demonstrations. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

(Athens) Last night, the Greek government mobilized troops because the border conflict between the Greek and Bulgarian armies had become more serious. It is reported that as a result of the conflict, 14 Greek soldiers were killed and 14 were injured. Previously, the Bulgarian army had attacked two Greek defense positions, resulting in the deaths of one Greek officer and three soldiers, and the injury of five Greek soldiers. Subsequently, the Greek army waited for reinforcements and counterattacked, capturing one Bulgarian army position and killing 10 Bulgarian soldiers and wounding 9. Because the conflict became more serious, the Greek government has called up officers and technicians from 1928 and 1934. (Associated Press dispatch of the 14th)

### German Gorilla Escapes in France; Found Heavily Intoxicated

(Dunkirk, Northern France) A gorilla escaped here recently, though it was soon captured, but residents were greatly alarmed. A German cargo ship, loaded with various animals such as rhinos, elephants, hippos, giraffes, and gorillas from Africa, was en route to the Hamburg Zoo. It made a short stop in this port, and just as it was about to set sail, it was discovered that a gorilla had escaped from its cage and fled ashore. As a result, many sailors from the ship, armed with knives, spears, or strong ropes, searched everywhere. At the same time, customs officials also patrolled the streets with weapons. Residents heard the news and closed their doors and stayed inside. The gorilla was found in a tavern, heavily intoxicated. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)

### Hungarian Foreign Minister Declares a "Sitting on the Fence" Policy; Wants to Rely on Germany and Italy, but also be Friendly with Poland

(Budapest, Hungary) Foreign Minister Csáky recently gave a speech in Sopron, discussing the European situation in general terms, saying, "I believe that the countries we can rely on as allies are primarily the Axis powers, and certainly Poland. We hope that Poland will be strong and will seek 'peace' in a wise and honorable manner. Our country's territorial integrity must be guaranteed, and we will not hesitate to use force if necessary. It goes without saying that 'Germany is peaceful towards our country and recognizes the inviolability of our current borders.' In addition, we hope to establish friendly relations with Yugoslavia and ease relations with Romania, thereby seeking understanding with patience and perseverance. Although we share the same interests as the Axis powers, we also wish to establish cultural and economic ties with Western European countries. Anyone who wishes our country to establish friendly relations with Germany and is willing to help create the possibility of peaceful development is our friend. Those who cause anxiety, suspicion, and disputes, please take another path." (Havas dispatch of the 14th)

### Italy Stations Heavy Troops in North Africa; Has 200 Airplanes

(Paris) Military sources here recently stated that Italy has stationed a large number of troops in its Libyan territory in North Africa, with three main targets: French Tunisia and southern Africa. These troops include troops from Italy itself, locally recruited native troops, native troops from Italian Eritrea in East Africa, and a small number of motorized units, totaling no less than 100,000 men. In addition, there is an air force with 200 airplanes. However, France has also taken various military measures in Tunisia, building strong fortifications in the border area. If Italy intends to attack there, it will not be easy, so it may not be attempted lightly. This is one reason. Egypt can be said to be completely undefended, and the military strength stationed there is very weak. However, if Italy blindly advances there, France will inevitably enter Libya from Tunisia, taking advantage of the situation. Since Libya is an important base for Italian troops in Africa, Italy would not risk leaving itself vulnerable. This is another reason. As for Italy's attack on southern Africa, although there are many technical difficulties, it is not impossible, because Italy can use Lake Chad in southern Abyssinia to extend its influence.

### Swedish Defense Bill Passes Parliament; Guaranteeing Neutrality in Wartime

(Stockholm, Sweden) The government's proposal to increase the number of army personnel, the main points of which are to call up reservists from the 1936 class and organize air defense teams in all important cities throughout the country, has been discussed and voted on by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate recently passed it by a vote of 87 to 37, and the House of Representatives passed it by a vote of 138 to 39. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)

(Stockholm, Sweden) In order to strengthen national defense, the government submitted a bill to the House of Representatives proposing that: The annual service period for naval officers and soldiers should be increased from 200 days to 340 days; special security teams should be formed in the infantry; air defense teams should be formed in all important cities throughout the country; reservists from the 1936 class should be called up for service. After deliberation, the House of Representatives National Defense Committee generally agreed with this plan, but argued that reservists from the 1934 class should also be called up for service. On the conservative side, however, they felt that the various measures proposed by the government were of no help, and therefore proposed a motion to call up seven classes of reservists at the same time. The House of Representatives put the party's motion to a vote today and immediately rejected it. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)

### Publisher of "The Man Who Killed Hitler," Bodin, Released After Being Kidnapped

(Los Angeles) Bodin, the husband of the deceased American female pilot Amelia Earhart, is a famous publisher. He recently published the book "The Man Who Killed Hitler." Not long after its release, he received a threatening letter signed by a National Socialist Party member from Los Angeles, stating that if he did not immediately stop publishing, he would be shot. Yesterday, he was suddenly kidnapped by two people in his garage, put in a car, and driven to a remote place 100 kilometers outside the city. They forced him to reveal the name of the author of the book. Bodin insisted that he did not know the author and could not tell them. The two then left in frustration. Because Bodin's hands and feet were tied, he could not move until he was discovered this morning and released. According to Bodin, the kidnappers spoke German but did not mistreat him.

### Japanese Troops in Hankou Discriminate Against British and American Nationals' Commercial Activities; All Foreign Activities Suspended; British and American Merchants' Properties Also Occupied

The "China Press" reports: A certain foreign merchant, formerly residing in Hankou and visiting Shanghai, yesterday (the 13th) recounted to reporters the current situation in Hankou eight months after its fall. He said that Hankou is now completely strangled; merchants are unable to engage in trade. The foreign merchant cited numerous instances of the Japanese side discriminating against foreign shops in the port, stating that the result is the complete suspension of all trade. However, there are many Japanese goods stored in the city. The Japanese side's discrimination is all-encompassing; therefore, there is no foreign trade in Hankou. Although some foreign goods are transported to Hankou, they are all carried by Japanese ships and handled by Japanese merchants. The entire urban area of Hankou is under Japanese control. As for the Chinese shops in the area, they have negotiated with the Japanese side and obtain goods from them, making substantial profits. The Japanese side controls all shipping in the area, closing the Yangtze River and prohibiting foreign ships from sailing. On his way downriver to Shanghai, he saw few ships on the Yangtze, but this situation varies from time to time because those that do sail are all carrying Japanese goods, leading to an overstock of Japanese goods in Hankou. The Japanese claim that all goods are military necessities is not credible, and the Japanese no longer make this claim in Hankou. When asked by the reporter whether it was true, as the Japanese side claimed, that there were a million Japanese soldiers in the Yangtze River region, the foreign merchant said he did not believe it. Only Jiujiang, Wuhu, and other places in the area have military activity. The main characteristic of the Yangtze River now is that there is no trade at all, and no houses are being rebuilt. The foreign merchant relayed the situation in Hankou itself, saying that residents cannot move without the permission of the Japanese authorities. Foreigners are often asked to show identification. A curfew is in effect from 11 p.m. every night. Foreigners must obtain permission to move goods, and this permission often takes three or four days to obtain. The supply of electricity for lighting is a clear example of Japanese discrimination. For example, British people on property owned by Jardine Matheson & Co. are not supplied with electricity, while Germans in the same area are. The Japanese in Hankou habitually occupy foreign property. They seize everything they consider to belong to the Chinese. If it suits their purposes, they occupy the property and do not leave. The Japanese believe that only they can decide whether property belongs to the Chinese. There have been many such cases to date. There have also been cases where British property has been occupied by the Japanese because it is managed or occupied by Chinese. The restrictions in the French Concession in Hankou have been relaxed, so entry and exit are easier than before. The supply of food has also gradually returned to normal, but there are still some restrictions that are quite inconvenient. Only the reopening of the Yangtze River can restore foreign trade in Hankou, but there is little hope of this, and there is no hope of removing all the restrictions that hinder trade. Unless these two things are done, there will be no foreign trade in Hankou. The police affairs of the Third Special District of Hankou (formerly the British Concession) are now managed by the Japanese, so the area is effectively under Japanese control. The Japanese are inclined to disregard the people of third countries, resulting in the infringement of foreign property, and the actual occupation will never end. The foreign merchant believes that the blockade of the Yangtze River is not militarily necessary but is a pretext for the Japanese to attempt to dominate trade. If this continues, foreign trade will be completely eliminated. This situation is closely linked to the situation in Europe. Britain is currently busy dealing with its domestic problems and does not interfere with others. Only the United States can deter Japan's monopoly of trade by implementing threats. The foreign merchant concluded by saying that there are no convenient travel arrangements today. Many people have been stranded in Hankou for months. The Japanese side's attitude towards navigation in the Yangtze River is clearly not benevolent. For example, missionaries can obtain permission to travel on the Yangtze River, but merchants cannot. Most debaters travel on British and American gunboats, but they must be escorted by Japanese warships. He believes that this is not necessary.

### Eight Japanese Planes Bomb Shantou with Increasing Ferocity; Bombing Continues Non-Stop on the 5th, 6th and 7th; U.S. Consulate in Shantou Nearly Hit; Major Buildings Flattened

Shantou Correspondence: Japanese planes carried out a large-scale bombing raid on Shantou on the 3rd and 4th, as reported in previous telegrams. It has now been confirmed that the bombs dropped on the 4th destroyed more than forty warehouses and civilian houses on Tongji Road, the entire Guanghua埠 match factory, and also bombed a garlic factory, killing more than a hundred people. The disaster area is vast, with more than a hundred houses destroyed. Many corpses have not been dug out, or the corpses have been blown to pieces, so the exact number cannot be counted. At 9 a.m. on the 5th, eight more Japanese planes flew into the city and dropped twenty-four bombs, which landed in Zhongshan Road, Gui Fu Li, Xin Mei Li, Xin Jian Li, Hui Lan Bridge, and the Qi Lu area, destroying 120 houses and killing or injuring 150 people.

Four Bombs Also Land Near British Warship

At 10 a.m. on the morning of the 6th, eight Japanese planes again flew to Qi Lu in the city and dropped bombs. The bombs landed about 400 feet from the U.S. Consulate. On the west embankment of Qi Lu, there was a British warship, which was intended to protect the foreign firms, but the Japanese planes disregarded it, flew low over the warship and dropped bombs. Four bombs also landed near the British warship, splashing water tens of feet high and creating huge waves. Four or five boats capsized on the embankment, drowning more than ten people. Foreigners were very angry. At the most critical moment, the British warship fired warning shots into the air, and the Japanese planes left. The Qi Lu Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Huang Family Ancestral Hall on Zhongshan Road, Da Zhong, Yi Zhong, and more than twenty nearby civilian houses were all destroyed. The factories and warehouses on Hui Lan Bridge, Tongji Road, Guanghua埠, and Wu Bridge Bank were also reduced to rubble. In the central area of Wai Ma Road, the bombs landed more than ten feet deep in Guangtian Right and Left Lanes, Hua Ming Road, and Zhongshan Park, turning the ground into a honeycomb pattern. More than 400 people were killed or injured. The Chao'an Railway Station, tracks, and power plant were hit by sixteen bombs and blown to pieces. All the machinery and industry in the Jieyang Qu Xi pond factory and grain factory were destroyed. The leper colony on the isolated island of Cao Yu was the most severely bombed, killing more than forty patients. Nan'ao, Long'ao, Raoping, and Zhao'an were also bombed. On Mount Jiaoshi in Shantou, there are two or three thousand people seeking refuge every day, squatting on the rocks. On the 7th, the Japanese warship stationed in Shantou moved to Xiamen, but in the afternoon of the same day, it still sent two planes to Shantou to drop bombs on Jiaoshi, killing fifteen people. Only six people were rescued. Most pitifully, an electric boat carrying refugees to Jieyang on the evening of the 6th collided with a sailboat on the way because it was sailing in the dark and sank, drowning more than 200 passengers. Only a dozen people were rescued. Also, a ferry returning to Shantou from Jiaoshi was sunk by the wind on the way, killing dozens of people. If the Japanese planes had not bombed Shantou, there would have been no such accidental disasters. On the 7th, a conspiracy agency was uncovered in Shantou, and a leader from Taiwan was arrested in a large hotel, along with more than a dozen men and women. When the planes were bombing that day, these people were pointing out targets and were very active. More people were arrested on the 8th and are currently being interrogated.

Shantou City is Extremely Desolate

At present, after the Japanese planes' frantic bombing, the entire city of Shantou has become a disaster area. All the larger factories, shops, and buildings have been razed to the ground, blood and flesh are blurred, the stench is pungent, flies are swarming, and birds are silent. A large number of residents in the city have been evacuated to the interior. Armed teams remain in the suburbs, preparing to fight. Zhang Fakui commissioned Liu Zhilu to organize the Chaozhou and Shantou strong men, limited to one month to complete the organization, to assist the military in combat. Liu arrived in Shantou on the 2nd to carry out all the preparatory work. There are only 40,000 to 50,000 people remaining in Shantou, equal to a quarter of the pre-war population. The goods in the shops could not be moved in a hurry. During the day, the shop doors are locked (or one or two people are left to guard the shop), and rice and charcoal are carried across the sea to Mount Jiaoshi for refuge. At night, they return to Shantou to open the doors for business, pack up the goods and transport them away, or sell them off cheaply in order to end their business. Boats and vehicles travel more at night, and people fleeing never stop all night. During the day, they disperse and hide, and no one is seen in the streets and alleys. The foreign firms have also all stopped operations. Most foreigners have moved to Mount Jiaoshi. Two bombs landed on the Qi Lu Zhonghe Foreign Firm, seriously injuring an American. Six Texaco oil depots on Hui Wan Bridge were all bombed and collapsed. Taikoo, Jardine, Butterfield & Swire, Imperial Chemical Industries, and HSBC, on the west embankment, made canvas flags several feet in size and covered them on the tiles, thinking that it would be safe according to foreign psychology. Unexpectedly, Japanese planes flew into the city and dropped more than ten bombs, followed by shooting. The planes flew as low as 500 feet, strafing back and forth, without any regard. Therefore, the foreign firms also suffered.

### The New Fourth Army Enters Zhejiang Province; Chinese Troops on the South Bank of the Qiantang River Also Cross the River in Succession

Jiaxing Correspondence: A certain unit of the New Fourth Army recently entered Zhejiang Province from Anhui. The suburbs of Hede and Jiashan are now full of the New Fourth Army, with outposts and key points stationed, waiting for a counterattack. Most of the soldiers are young intellectuals, and they are warmly welcomed by the people along the way.

In the past week, the ×××× divisions of the Chinese army on the south bank of the Qiantang River have crossed the river in succession, transferred to Hede, and advanced towards the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Suzhou-Jiaxing lines, preparing to closely contact the original garrison troops in each area, and then counterattack. It is also heard that Liu Jianxu, commander of the ×× Army Group, recently went to a certain place to meet with Gu Zhutong, commander of the ×× War Zone, to discuss military opportunities.

The Suzhou Pond, Pinghu Pond, and Jiashan Pond canals in Jiaxing have been blockaded by the Chinese army at various key points. For the sake of consolidating the rear defense, the Chinese army, assisted by strong men, has also blockaded all rivers, regardless of size.

### Japanese Secret Service in Xuzhou Instigates Anti-British Movement Among the People; Parades and Demonstrations Shout Slogans; Also Plan to Organize Anti-British Congress

Xuzhou Correspondence: The Japanese secret service agencies in various places in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan are instigating puppet organizations to force the people to hold anti-British movements, launch anti-British propaganda parades, and form permanent anti-British groups, with the principle of resisting British goods and overthrowing British imperialism as the propaganda principle. Recently, the Japanese puppets will further implement a radical anti-British movement, suspected of searching for British goods in various occupied areas and destroying them. For example, the Japanese army in Anqing and Bengbu has burned more than a thousand boxes of Great Britain brand cigarettes and is preparing to expel British merchants and missionaries from the country. It is heard that after the anti-British movement is successful, the Japanese puppets will prepare to promote anti-Americanism in order to create an atmosphere of confrontation with the anti-aggression line. The Xuzhou Japanese secret service agency, with the successive holding of anti-British movements in central China and other places, especially on the afternoon of the 23rd of last month at 1 p.m., instigated the puppet organization to force the people to hold the Xuzhou people's anti-British movement conference in the Chenghuang Temple on Public Security Street. Li Yangzhou was the chairman, and there was a parade and demonstration. Those who attended the meeting included various puppet agencies and schools. At that time, resolutions and telegrams were passed, and anti-British songs were sung and slogans were shouted. The lyrics were, "The Sino-Japanese war broke out last year, and the British instigated it as the source of the disaster. Miserable, miserable, the British again want to take advantage of the situation. White people are related to each other. In the Opium War, we paid reparations, ceded land, and opened ports at the forefront. The British are cunning, and we must strengthen the anti-British front. We swear not to let the treacherous British invade the Central Plains." The slogans were, "Sino-Japanese friendship, oppose European and American aid to China to prolong the war and destroy East Asian peace."

Rugao Correspondence: The Rugao Baipu Japanese Army Headquarters convened puppet organization personnel on May 1 to hold a conference to resist British goods, forcing the people to participate. The entire town was plastered with anti-British and other absurd slogans. It is also heard that the Japanese army will recently implement inspections of British goods in stores in various villages and towns, and from now on, the people will be uniformly prohibited from trafficking in them, and violators will be punished.

### Jiangsu Province Restores the Mobilization Committee; County Committees Are Restored at the Same Time

Xinghua Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Government instructed the county magistrates that, since the establishment of the Provincial Mobilization Committee and the General Command of the People's Self-Defense Team, most of the work has been handled by the latter, and the work of the committee has been suspended. Now, the central government stipulates that the provincial national spiritual mobilization should be carried out, and the committee should be the executive agency. All matters related to the organization of the Provincial National Spiritual Mobilization Association and the convening of the Provincial National Spiritual Mobilization Conference are urgently needed to be prepared. A letter has been sent to the standing committee member and secretary-general of the committee, urging them to restore work and promote the conference. The mobilization committees in various counties have also been mostly suspended invisibly since the establishment of the county people's self-defense team headquarters. They should also uniformly restore work at the same time in order to preside over the mobilization of the people in each county and promote national spiritual mobilization. All the measures that should be determined, as well as the distribution of funds, etc., should be handled after the Provincial Mobilization Committee orders. It is heard that Xinghua, Dongtai, Yancheng, and other counties have resumed office.

### Overview of Frontier Education; Frontier Education Funding Continues to Increase; Many Frontier Education Facilities Promoted

(Special dispatch from Chongqing) Since the Ministry of Education established the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department in 1930, it has been actively engaged in frontier education, and it has achieved considerable results. Here is a summary of its main points:

Frontier Education Funding

Regarding the planning and distribution of frontier education funds, the Ministry of Education and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission discussed it several times in 1931, 1932, and 1933 and promoted the frontier education plan. In the end, the annual budget of only 50,000 yuan was used by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to subsidize several schools in the border areas that had excellent results, subsidize border students to study, and moderately subsidize border cultural groups. There were no remaining funds available for distribution, and the proposed plans could not be realized. The Ministry of Education, in view of the complexity of the frontier problem, if it does not urgently seek to establish a cultural foundation, political and educational construction may not be able to proceed. In 1935, it designated 500,000 yuan from the funds to subsidize remote and poor provinces for the purpose of running frontier education. In 1937, it increased to 640,000 yuan, designating six uses: (1) subsidizing schools with excellent results; (2) training teachers; (3) increasing the number of primary schools; (4) increasing the number of social education agencies; (5) subsidizing border students to study; (6) compiling and printing teaching materials.

School Education

The frontier schools subsidized by the Ministry of Education include one class of Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui teacher training classes attached to the Lanzhou Xiangshi in Gansu Province, 55 primary schools, one Mongolian and Tibetan simple teacher school in Xining, Qinghai Province, two middle schools, 143 primary schools, two Mongolian Banner Normal Classes in Ningxia Province, 14 primary schools, one Kangding Simple Normal School in Xikang Province, five primary schools, three Yunnan Provincial Border Simple Normal Schools (reported as ten, but no detailed report has been received by the department, so only those that have been reported are listed), 35 primary schools, one Guiyang Xiangshi School in Guizhou Province, 12 primary schools, two Pingshan and Maoxian Simple Normal Schools in Sichuan Province, 15 primary schools, one teacher training class in the Xiangxi Special Zone in Hunan Province, 100 short-term primary schools, five Mongolian and Hui normal classes attached to the Dihua Normal School in Xinjiang Province, and one Aksu Simple Normal School, 1,412 primary schools, one National Suiyuan Mongolian Banner Normal School in Suiyuan Province, one Mongolian Banner Middle School subsidized in Tumote Banner, 29 primary schools, 13 Mongolian Banner primary schools in Chahar Province (Chahar is currently completely suspended, and there are four primary schools in Suiyuan that continue to open), one Guangxi Provincial Special Teacher Training Institute, 541 primary schools, and one Lhasa Municipal First Primary School in Tibet. A total of 12 normal schools and 9 classes, 3 middle schools, and 3,374 primary schools.

Social Education

The social education agencies subsidized by the Ministry of Education include one Mongolian Banner Education Mobile Work Team in Ningxia Province, one Mobile Education Team of the Lhasa Tibetan Cultural Promotion Association, one Mongolian Cultural Center (which has been discontinued), one Second Mobile Social Education Center in Chahar Province (which has been discontinued), and one Mongolian Translation Center established by the twelve banners of Chahar Province (which has been discontinued).

Temple Education

In order to improve temple education, the Ministry of Education, together with the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, issued a circular to the education halls of various border provinces and the Mongolian and Tibetan local governments, urging the local temples to establish public schools or supplementary schools for the nearby people and monks to study. The mosques of the Hui religion were also instructed to add subjects such as national language common sense and arithmetic to the Awen schools. In addition, the time for lecturing on scriptures in various temples was used to give lectures on spiritual lectures and literacy movements, and methods were devised to train lamas, monks, and ahongs.

Student Preference

In order to encourage Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui students to enter specialty schools and above in the interior, the Ministry of Education allocated special funds for subsidies from 1936, subsidizing 300 yuan per person per year. In addition, travel expenses were also issued as appropriate, with an average of dozens of people subsidized each year.

Cultural Lectures

In order to communicate Han and Tibetan culture, the Ministry of Education added Tibetan cultural lectures at five universities, including Central, Tsinghua, Wuhan, Sun Yat-sen, and Beijing, in 1937, and specially hired Tibetan Geshe Xirao Jiacuo as the lecturer.

Compilation of Teaching Materials

The situation in the border areas is special, and the languages are different, so ordinary teaching materials cannot be applied. The Ministry of Education separately compiled, printed, and distributed applications. The teaching materials that have now been compiled include "Han-Mongolian Bilingual" textbooks, eight volumes of national language for primary schools, four volumes of common sense, a thousand-character textbook on the Three Principles of the People, a volume of short-term primary school textbooks, "Han-Tibetan Bilingual" textbooks, four volumes of national language for primary schools, a volume of textbooks for public schools, and three volumes of "Han-Hui Bilingual" primary school textbooks. In addition, eight volumes of Han-Tibetan bilingual textbooks submitted by Xikang and five volumes of Han-Tibetan reading materials submitted by the Han-Tibetan Buddhist Academy have been reviewed and finalized, but the content is not perfect and is currently being revised.

Improvements

(1) "Expansion of the Scope of Frontier Education Facilities." The population in the border areas is complex, the culture is backward, and the conditions in various places are different. Not only the Mongolian and Tibetan areas must adapt to the environment to implement education, but also the Hui people in Xinjiang, the Tibetan in Qinghai, and various ethnic groups in the southwestern border areas, whose languages and customs are very different from those in the interior. We should implement education according to their actual needs so that it is easier to achieve results. Therefore, the scope of work of the Mongolian and Tibetan Department of the Ministry of Education has spread to various places in the border areas. (2) "Correction of the Name of Mixed Education." The purpose of frontier education is the integration of national culture. If different names are established and characteristics are marked, it is tantamount to dispersing the entire Chinese nation. If students of various ethnic groups are taught separately, their feelings cannot be connected. Therefore, the Ministry of Education issued a circular to various schools in the border areas, requiring them to use place names as school names, recruit students, regardless of ethnicity, and mix education in order to eliminate the boundaries between various ethnic groups. (3) "Taking the National Language as the Center of Education." The main reason for the emotional barriers between ethnic minorities is the difference in language. Therefore, the first task of frontier education must be to enable the people in the border areas to understand the national language and national language, so that unnecessary barriers can be eliminated invisibly. (4) "Frontier Education Undertakings" are gradually being changed from subsidy methods to direct management by the central government. Due to the lack of political order in various parts of the frontier, there are many obstacles to the implementation of frontier education. Therefore, the Ministry of Education is trying to reorganize the original educational institutions and continue to provide subsidies, while gradually establishing national model schools to control teachers, establishing experimental primary schools to guide local education, establishing national middle schools to absorb young people, establishing vocational schools in the border areas to train construction talents, and establishing frontier schools as the center for research and promotion of education in various regions. In this way, frontier education undertakings can be gradually controlled by the central government so that they can proceed smoothly under a certain plan and policy.

### Hong Kong Education Should Be Avoided; Improving Chinese Education; Establishing Specialized Schools to Train Teachers; Education Funding Increases Monthly

(Hong Kong Correspondence) Chinese education in Hong Kong has many shortcomings due to its special environment, and it is completely disconnected from the domestic education system. In recent years, Chinese and foreign educators have criticized this. The Hong Kong education authorities, in view of this, are eager to improve it. They have considered the issues of teachers, funding, and the education system and have formulated improvement measures. Part of the plan has been implemented, and the rest can also be implemented in the short term. Here is a record of the situation:

Improving Shortcomings

The unsoundness of the Hong Kong education system has been pointed out by Chinese and foreign educators for many years. Its obvious shortcomings include the following: (1) English schools focus too much on general education and neglect vocational education. In addition to those who go to the University of Hong Kong and domestic universities, the graduates of middle schools go to government agencies and foreign firms, and very few enter other professions. The reason is that there is a lack of vocational training. (2) In terms of Chinese schools, the curriculum and graduation level are not connected with those of domestic schools, especially in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. There are many middle schools in Hong Kong without physics and chemistry laboratories, and there are also many that do not include physics and chemistry in the curriculum. After graduation, students who go to the University of Hong Kong have difficulty being admitted due to their English level, and it is not easy to go to school in China, and employment is even more bleak. (3) The unsoundness of education in Hong Kong and poor teachers are one of the main reasons. Improving teachers must start with teacher training. The authorities have also recognized the shortcomings of education in Hong Kong in recent years and it is necessary to improve it. Special education experts have been commissioned to take charge of it. The current Director of Education, Sulis, is a well-known education expert. According to the past education directors in Hong Kong, they were all promoted and appointed by educators. Only Su was transferred from elsewhere, which shows the attention of the authorities to improving education in Hong Kong.

Training Teachers

The change in the beginning of the school year has been implemented years ago to connect it with domestic schools. Currently, schools in Hong Kong have changed from starting in the spring to starting in the fall. In addition, the biggest measure of the education authorities is to improve the quality of teachers. The teacher training school run by the Education Department is scheduled to start classes in September. The school site has been selected at the old National Hospital, and repairs are currently underway. Classes will be taught in Chinese and English, with a two-year training period. After graduation, they will be sent to various public and private schools to teach.

Increased Funding

As for the original Chinese Women's Normal School of the Education Department, most of its graduates have served in the education sector. In order to encourage schools to employ graduates of the school, the education authorities have stipulated the level of subsidies for schools, which is determined by the number of graduates employed by the school. Those who employ four or more people are top-level subsidized schools, those who employ two people are third-level subsidized schools, and those who employ one person are fourth-level subsidized schools. The Education Department has greatly increased its funding due to the various improvement projects carried out in recent years. The monthly expenditure exceeds 100,000 yuan, and last month it reached 438,306 yuan.

### Shanghai Foreign Football Club Sends Letter to Hong Kong: Resuming the Shanghai-Hong Kong Port Competition

(Hong Kong Newsletter) The Shanghai Foreign Football Club recently sent a letter to Hong Kong requesting the resumption of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Port Competition. The reason is that although the Chinese area of Shanghai has fallen, the concessions have not been affected in any way. If Chinese players are unwilling to go to Shanghai, the Hong Kong Football Association is requested to persuade them. However, according to general observations, the Hong Kong side will decide whether to reply based on how the overall situation at the end of the year will develop. The Shanghai Football Club has been greatly affected by the lack of a Hong Kong-Shanghai Port Competition this year in terms of funding, hence this request.

### The Rice Market is Superficially Stable, but Underground Transactions Remain Intense; The Market Management Committee Strictly Investigates and Stipulates Rewards for Reporting Information; Expecting the Concession Authorities to Properly Plan Methods

Since Wuhu, Wuxi, and other places have prohibited the export of rice, general hoarders are taking advantage of this time of year when the old crop is running out and the new crop is not yet available, attempting to monopolize the market, causing market chaos, and underground transactions have revived. After emergency measures were taken by the rice industry organizations, yesterday the market was gradually stabilized, and prices fell back and tended to be stable. The rice industry is waiting for the concession authorities to quickly develop appropriate methods. The details are recorded as follows:

Hoarders Monopolize and the Market is Chaotic

After the Bean and Rice Industry Market Management Committee strictly implemented price limits and banned illegal underground transactions, the market price finally stabilized, and underground transactions disappeared. Recently, Wuhu, Wuxi, and other places have prohibited the export of rice, so general hoarders took the opportunity to monopolize and attempt to make huge profits. The situation in the market is tense, and underground transactions have revived. The top-grade white rice has exceeded 16 yuan, and the price of other grades of rice has either exceeded the price limit or reached the top price, and the situation is chaotic and serious. The retail price of top-grade white rice at rice shops has risen to 16.2 yuan, and the price of second-grade rice has also exceeded the limit of 15 yuan. If this continues, it will have a huge impact on the entire Shanghai food supply.

Stipulating Rewards for Reporting Information

Rice industry organizations such as the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Shop Association held an informal meeting the night before last to strictly ban underground transactions in the market and strictly implement price limits to maintain the Shanghai food supply. In addition to re-promulgating strict enforcement and punishment, they also hope that anyone will report any information at any time. If there is no material evidence, but there are indeed factual witnesses, once verified, punishment will be imposed, and the reporter will be rewarded with 30% of the fine. For example, if it is verified that the buyer, seller, and intermediary each receive a fine of 100 yuan, then the reward will be 30 yuan in total, aiming to reward anyone who reports information.

Ordering the Management Committee to Strictly Investigate

The Bean and Rice Industry Association has ordered all 19 members of the Market Management Committee, including Fu Qian'geng, Wang Tianqiu, and Gu Yisheng, to strictly investigate improper transactions in the market, strictly implement price limits, and impose strict penalties according to law. In addition, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inspected the market yesterday morning and found that the chaotic situation was slightly better than the day before, the people's hearts were gradually stabilized, and prices fell back. However, the total number of transactions concluded according to the price limit was only more than 5,000 bags. As for underground transactions, they remained the same, but the traders were all sneaky because they were afraid of being reported and punished by the Market Management Committee.

Seven Rice Inventory Surveys Have Been Completed

The Shanghai Concession's rice inventory, according to the sixth survey report of the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee on May 6, was 567,138 bags. As for the seventh rice inventory survey, it was completed yesterday and is being organized. It is expected to be formally released today. It is reported that the total number is 563,000 bags, a decrease of about 3,000 bags from the previous week. As for the rice transported to Shanghai from the producing areas in recent days, there were about 2,000 bags on the 13th and about 2,500 bags on the 14th. At this time when the old crop is running out and the new crop is not yet available, the scarcity of rice is a phenomenon that occurs every year, but the soaring price of rice is indeed unexpected.

Waiting for the Authorities to Properly Plan Methods

The New Voice News Agency reporter learned from the rice industry organizations yesterday that the methods recommended by the rice industry to the concession authorities to regulate the Shanghai food supply are: (1) to prepare for the future and order foreign rice to provide relief; (2) to dredge the source of production areas to maintain the Shanghai food supply. It is reported that the concession authorities have handed it over to the Rice and Grain Joint Management Committee for research. Now, the rice industry organizations are waiting for the concession authorities to develop a proper plan. Since the production areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have fallen into war zones, they have been repeatedly illegally obstructed by the Japanese, resulting in many obstacles to the transportation of domestic rice. Now, the power to dredge the source is beyond the reach of the rice industry organizations, so please ask the concession authorities to find a way to dredge it.

Hoarders Refuse to Register Rice Inventory

Regarding the source of rice and grain, if it is unfortunately cut off, it will directly affect the food supply of millions of people and indirectly affect the security of the two concessions. As for ordering foreign rice, at the current price, Saigon is 198 catties per bag, which is equivalent to 20 yuan in national currency, then 160 catties per stone is equivalent to 16 yuan in national currency. The Shanghai Jianghai Customs has long exempted the import of foreign rice from taxes since the war. In addition, the association's rice inventory registration has been held from the 12th to the 18th of this month, but general hoarders are waiting and watching and refusing to register, so there are no results to speak of. Now, the association has decided to report to the concession authorities for instructions on effective methods.

### Can Europe Avoid War? The Views of Foreigners in Shanghai; French Pessimists Believe War is Inevitable; Germans and Italians Say Peaceful Resolution is Hoped for; Americans Say America Will Not Participate

—Translated from Sunday Mercury—

Most foreigners in this city do not believe that a European war is imminent. At least one Frenchman feels that war is inevitable sooner or later. One Italian believes that the elements of war are more likely to occur than not. However, one German believes that all problems can eventually find a peaceful resolution. Those who do not believe that war is about to come think that hope may be the mother of thought. However, the American community dares to decide that the United States will not participate in the war. Because the European crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, the reporter asked the opinions of the expatriates of several countries most related to the European situation. The compilation is as follows, which I think those who care about the current situation will be happy to hear.

Germany is Willing to Live in Peace with France

Dr. William, a German lawyer, said: "I don't believe that war is imminent. Germany has a peace-loving leader and does not want to resort to force. I recently traveled to Europe and felt that only Germany did not talk about war among the countries. People in other countries all said that Germany did not heed the opinions of various countries and newspapers. It is very foolish to say this. You must know that Germany is not like that. Germany always wants to live in peace with its neighbors. Leader Hitler recently made a special statement that Germany is willing to live in peace with France. Germany is not shaken by the fact that British newspapers are talking about war. Germany does not want any territory from Britain. I think the Polish problem may be resolved peacefully. I believe that Poland and other countries can understand. If Germany is separated by a corridor to another country, and Germany is not given the convenience of transportation, this is unreasonable. The leader once said in a certain speech that the National Socialist Party Congress in September this year will be called the 'Peace Congress.' This is very noteworthy."

The Situation in Italy is Different Now

An Italian named Lichini of the China-Italy Shipping Company said: "There are two opportunities to hope to save the European war: (1) The so-called democratic front is in harmony with the Axis powers; (2) The front is powerful enough to scare Berlin and Rome. Then the latter may be difficult to achieve. Germany and Italy will fight for their rights. Italy has not forgotten that it was betrayed by Britain and France when negotiating peace after the last European war. Britain and France encompassed everything, while Italy gained nothing. Hungry people will not choose food and must fight for it. Now there is one thing that can be decided. Germany and Italy will never be satisfied with what they have now. The Italian people are now being injected with propaganda every day, making them know that Italy's national power is strong. The authorities rarely talk about the lack of money, and they have not paid attention to the fact that in the new era of war, the economy is more important than weapons. The situation today is certainly far less bad than in 1935. At that time, the British fleet sailed into the Mediterranean Sea to deal with the Italian fleet. The Italian fleet's military supplies were only enough for six hours of fighting. Today, the Italian army and navy have sufficient military supplies."

Japanese Thoughts Focus on Britain

Shibata, a Japanese reporter for the Allied News Agency, said: "I think the chances of the European war realizing and disappearing each account for half. Britain has many concerns about the war. One is that if the European war breaks out, Japan will take the opportunity to seize the interests of the British in the Far East. Second, Britain wants to maintain the balance and the current situation, and wants to determine the results of the German, Italian, and Japanese anti-communist alliance, so that it can speak. Therefore, it will not launch at least at present. In short, Britain is now taking a wait-and-see attitude. Most of its attention will undoubtedly be on the possibility of Britain as a mediator to form a Chinese-Japanese peace, because this move can place Japan in a disadvantaged position to participate in the European war on a large scale. Britain believes that if so, it can proceed to establish a democratic front. The overall situation is very subtle now. Who dares to decide whether the European war is about to happen or not? Because any event can affect the balance."

French Businessmen Observe that War is Inevitable

The import manager of a Parisian commercial bank that runs world trade said: "In my view, the European war is inevitable. It will either happen in the near future, or it will happen some time from now, or it will even happen tomorrow. But I dare to decide that it will eventually happen. I think all negotiations will not only be insufficient to cure the disease, but will also increase it. The only hope is that the democratic car line is stronger than the Berlin-Rome axis. I am afraid that even so, it cannot eliminate the war. A letter from my Paris head office said, "Although the war will not happen immediately, we must prepare for the worst." Therefore, orders for goods sold to China that are immediately delivered can still be accepted in France. Orders for long-term delivery must be rejected, in case of war, the port is blocked, or the ship is sunk, and the goods are confiscated. "Since the summer of 1914, Europe has never been so worried about war as it is today. When the Czech crisis occurred in September last year, my commercial bank still accepted long-term orders and took risks, but today I dare not. "This has caused great damage to businesses that ship goods from Europe to Shanghai. Since the import of textiles has increased sharply after the Chinese factory was destroyed by artillery fire, it would be great if we could accept long-term orders."

Democratic Countries Can Eliminate European War

A British securities broker who recently traveled to Europe and returned to Shanghai said: "I think the sudden strengthening of the attitude of democratic countries is enough to eliminate the European war. Today, gunpowder is scattered all over Europe, and a spark can easily make it a prairie fire. But I think Hitler and Mussolini now need to use safety matches and plan to continue to do this prevention. They would rather negotiate than take the risk of starting a war in the hope of luck. If they lose first, they will lose everything they have today. I think Germany has signed an agreement with Romania, so it can obtain the benefits that it can get from recovering its old colonies, such as oil and wheat products, which can be obtained at will without paying for travel expenses and maintaining maritime navigation. The tension in Europe is not something that can be relaxed for a while, but I believe that war will not happen."

Mussolini's Wisdom Will Not Seek War

Ross, the secretary of the American Navy Youth Association, said: "In my personal opinion, there will be no war in Europe. European politicians know the meaning of war, and Mussolini is the most. Mussolini is so smart and so patriotic that he will not bear to let Italy fall into destruction. During the last European war, I served in the Italian Youth Association for a long time and gained a lot of experience. I know Mussolini very well, but I know very little about Hitler. However, I think Hitler will not be able to do anything without Mussolini's help. Mussolini is good at using his wisdom, and even his enemies admire him. I believe that Mussolini must know that once a war breaks out, he will lose his power and destroy the achievements of his hands. Italy's financial resources cannot engage in a war. Italy may be in danger of being forced into the vortex of war, like Austria in the last European war, but I personally do not believe that Italy will do this. I fully believe that Mussolini, because of his familiarity with the economy and his love for his country, will never sign a declaration of war against Britain and France. He must find another way out like he did in Munich."

### After the Joint Announcement Was Revealed, the Japanese Side's Remarks: Believing That the Difference Between the Two Concessions' Demands on Japan Lies in Whether to Contact the Pseudo "Municipal Government"

The Mainland News Agency said that a Japanese naval spokesperson claimed when receiving reporters from various newspapers yesterday (the 13th) that after the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council and the French Concession Municipal Council issued a joint announcement on Thursday, the only difference in the attitude of the Japanese side's demands was the different attitudes of the two bureaus towards the "Shanghai Municipal Government." The French authorities directly contacted the "Municipal Government" on certain issues, while the Municipal Council did not even reply to the notes sent by the "Municipal Government." When asked by the spokesperson to detail what he called "certain issues," the naval spokesperson replied that nothing had been determined yet, but they were all minor issues, one of which was related to the French Concession waterworks in the South City. The spokesperson did not know any definite results obtained from the joint announcement, but said that he hoped to see good results soon. At the same time, there was no other criticism of the May 11 announcement prohibiting Chinese political groups in the two concessions by both the Chinese and Japanese sides.

### The US Commissioner to the Philippines is Passing Through Shanghai to Go to North China. The Transport Ship is Docked at Woosung and the Commissioner Does Not Disembark. He Will Come to Shanghai at the End of the Month Before Returning Home.

The Mainland News Agency reported that US Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt arrived here on the US Navy transport ship Chaumont on Sunday from Manila, but McNutt did not disembark. The news came from the Chaumont last night (the 13th). The ship was scheduled to dock outside Woosung around 11:00 AM on Sunday, and after unloading a small amount of goods and waiting for two teams of US 4th Marine Regiment soldiers to board the ship to go to Qinhuangdao for summer target practice, it will depart around 5:00 PM on the same day.

Heading to North China

McNutt does not plan to disembark in Shanghai, but will go to North China and make a short stay in Qingdao, Yantai, and Qinhuangdao. On May 23, he will return to Shanghai on the Chaumont. The ship will dock in Shanghai for a week or ten days. McNutt is traveling with his family this time and plans to leave Shanghai on the President Coolidge on May 31 and return to the United States. After arriving in Washington, he will report to President Roosevelt on the situation in the Philippines and is expected to submit his resignation. Most people believe that McNutt is a Democratic candidate for the next US presidential election, so he is expected to devote himself to the election campaign from now until next year. On Sunday, McNutt will not meet with reporters, which was not known last night, but it is generally believed that if reporters can board the transport ship, McNutt may meet with reporters on Sunday afternoon. Among the officers and soldiers who disembarked from the Chaumont on Sunday were 85 Marine Corps officers and soldiers who will join the 4th Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai. US Asian Fleet warships scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on May 20 include the submarine tender Canopus and six submarines, which will dock in Shanghai for about ten days and then sail to Qingdao.

### European Refugee Committee Chairman, Mr. Speelman, Left Shanghai Yesterday to Raise Funds in America, Britain, and France to Aid Jewish Refugees in Shanghai

Mr. Speelman, Chairman of the European Refugee Relief Committee in Shanghai, departed from Shanghai yesterday morning on the Japanese Empress liner to raise funds for the relief of Jewish refugees who were forced to come to Shanghai from Central Europe. He will first go to New York in America, then to London in England, and Paris in France to appeal for aid. It is reported that Mr. Speelman is expected to return to Shanghai at the end of this year. It is also learned that the famous foreign psychologist, Dr. Han Fen, also went to the United States on the same ship yesterday to visit psychological medical colleges in Central America as the focal point.

### Puppet "Director of the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau" Li Jiannan Dismissed

Since taking office, Li Jiannan, the puppet "Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs," concurrently served as the puppet "Director of the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau." Li held two positions, and a group of puppet officials coveted Li's lucrative post. Recently, someone incited Chen Jintao, the puppet Minister of Finance of the Reformed Government, to offer a considerable price to remove Li's concurrent position as the puppet "Director of the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau." After receiving the "order," Li is preparing to hand over the position, as the post of "Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs" alone is sufficient. It is now heard that a certain Tan is planning to lobby for the position and is currently maneuvering for it.

### Shanghai Lacks Investment Opportunities as Domestic Economic Environment Changes (Continued from Yesterday) Overly Optimistic Views of Shanghai's Abnormal Prosperity are Unwarranted Developing the Southwest Economy Depends on Transportation Infrastructure - Report from the Shanghai Banking Corporation's Annual Meeting

This year, China's foreign trade has been severely affected by the war. Imports totaled 86,199,000 yuan, a decrease of 67,186,000 yuan compared to the previous year. Exports totaled 762,641,000 yuan, a decrease of 75,615,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The trade deficit was 122,558,000 yuan, an increase of 8,428,000 yuan compared to the previous year. However, the above figures are based on the legal exchange rate of gold units converted to national currency for total import value, while the total export value has been automatically adjusted based on the black market exchange rate, which does not accurately reflect the severity of the impact. If both are calculated in pounds sterling based on the black market exchange rate, the total import value would be £49,708,000, a decrease of £7,079,000 compared to the previous year, and the total export value would be £31,470,000, a decrease of £18,301,000, while the trade deficit would be £18,223,700, a significant increase of £11,220,000 compared to the previous year, indicating that the decline in exports is greater than that of imports.

### Stagnant Production

Due to the westward shift of the war and the expansion of the war zone, many production enterprises have been destroyed, and the output of local goods has decreased. Moreover, transportation is difficult due to blocked traffic. The only gateway for exports during the year was the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, which was also interrupted in the autumn. Fortunately, the government established a trade adjustment agency to actively encourage exports, and major local goods were able to be exported quickly. Otherwise, the decline in the value of export trade might have been even greater.

### Grains and Flour

Among the increased imports, the largest increase was in grains and flour, totaling 130,004,000 yuan, an increase of more than 71 million yuan compared to the previous year. Wheat flour alone increased by more than 46 million yuan, and rice imports also increased by 16 million yuan. This is because the domestic grain supply cannot be transported in large quantities due to the war, and the coastal ports have to rely on imported food.

### Metals and Minerals

The largest decrease in imports was in metals and minerals, totaling 65,117,000 yuan, a decrease of 66 million yuan compared to the previous year. Various construction projects were suspended this year, and metal transportation was difficult, resulting in a significant decrease in imports. The largest import quantities were grains, flour, groceries, oils, candles, soaps, metals, minerals, chemical medicines, machinery, tools, paper, and vehicles.

### Textiles and Fibers

The largest increase in exports was in textiles and fibers, totaling 165,127,000 yuan, an increase of more than 36 million yuan compared to the previous year, mainly due to the increase in cotton exports, most of which were shipped to Japan, reaching about 110.1 million yuan, an increase of nearly 70 million yuan compared to the previous year. However, the exports of other textiles and fibers, such as wool and raw silk, decreased.

### Sharp Decrease in Oils

The most significant decrease in exports was in oils, a decrease of more than 53 million yuan, a decrease of 73 million yuan compared to the previous year. This is because tung oil exports fell from more than 89 million yuan in the previous year to more than 39 million yuan this year, due to the impact of blocked inland transportation. The largest export quantities were textiles, fibers, livestock products, minerals, yarn, oils, waxes, and tea.

### Japan Ranks First

In terms of countries, Japan ranked first in imports this year, increasing from 150.4 million yuan in the previous year to 20.9 billion yuan this year. The United States decreased from 188.8 million yuan in the previous year to 151.2 million yuan. Germany, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies also decreased compared to the previous year. In terms of exports, Hong Kong ranked first, increasing from 162.9 million yuan in the previous year to 243.3 million yuan. Japan increased from 84.3 million yuan in the previous year to 116.5 million yuan. The United States, Britain, and Germany also decreased compared to the previous year.

### Shanghai Trade

In terms of ports, Shanghai has always accounted for more than half of the country's import and export trade. This year, it decreased from 91.3 billion yuan in the previous year to 49.1 billion yuan, while other ports increased from 87.8 million yuan in the previous year to 11.57 billion yuan. Shanghai's trade accounts for less than one-third of the total trade volume. This is because a port's trade must have a vast and easily accessible hinterland to support it. Now, the Yangtze River basin, which Shanghai relies on as its hinterland, has become a war zone, and all industries have been suspended. Moreover, transportation is difficult due to blocked traffic, and the decline in trade is inevitable. All of these are the effects of the war and deserve our attention.

### Domestic Trade

Domestic trade has also been severely affected by the spread of the war. In the past, Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou were important distribution centers for domestic goods. This year, the Yangtze River waterway is still blocked, and it is difficult to transport goods from the war zone. Even trade between the interior and Shanghai and coastal ports has to be rerouted through South China, transported via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Changsha, Hankou, and other places. After the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou, goods are either transported through Haiphong, via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Kunming, or through Guangzhou Bay, via highways to Guangxi, or through Wenzhou and Ningbo, via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to the southwestern provinces. Transportation has become increasingly difficult, resulting in a shortage of manufactured goods and coastal products needed in the interior, and prices are rising daily. At the same time, raw materials and grains, such as cotton and wheat, supplied to Shanghai from the interior cannot be transported, and Shanghai factories have to rely on foreign cotton and wheat. If the war continues, the economic structure of the interior may become self-sufficient due to the stagnation of domestic trade.

### Prices

This year, prices in various regions have fluctuated sharply due to the lack of coordination in the supply and demand of goods, and prices have generally trended upward. The main reason is the stagnation of production or transportation difficulties. Demand has not increased, but supply has decreased significantly. Therefore, although the amount of currency in circulation has not increased significantly, the prices of various goods have continued to rise. In Shanghai, the general price index rose from 134.3 in December of the previous year (with 1929 as 100) to 159.4 in December of this year, an increase of 18%. Except for food, the prices of other commodities have increased significantly. Observing the above table, the price of food has increased less, so the cost of living index in Shanghai has decreased from 158.54 in December of the previous year to 154.93 in December of this year. Compared with January before August 13th, it has increased by more than 41%. However, this cost of living index refers to the living of Shanghai workers. If ordinary salaried people consume a smaller proportion of food, then their index will inevitably be higher than that of December last year. The prices of manufactured goods in the interior have also risen sharply. The price of 20-count cotton yarn in Chongqing once rose to 1,000 yuan per bale. In addition, the prices of daily necessities and luxury goods, such as towels, toothbrushes, cigarettes, and beer, have increased by one or two times, which is common. However, the prices of local goods that rely on exports have fallen due to transportation inconveniences. For example, tung oil and gallnuts are increasing in price in foreign ports, but their prices are falling in the production areas. The price difference is often more than doubled. All of these are due to transportation difficulties and high costs, which have led to a lack of coordination in the supply and demand of goods. However, what is gratifying is that although most commodity prices have fluctuated sharply, food prices in various regions have remained very stable. Except for one or two cities where the number of refugees has suddenly increased, there has been no sharp rise in prices. This is because last year's autumn harvest was abundant, and the supply was sufficient, which helped maintain social order in the interior and made a significant contribution to the wartime economy.

### Commerce

This year, the changes in industry and commerce in various regions vary greatly due to the different impacts of the war. In Shanghai, except for the Chinese areas that have been destroyed and Hongkou and Yangshupu that have not yet been opened, the industry and commerce within the concessions have experienced abnormal prosperity, and the profits are unprecedented. The reasons are:

### Increase in Refugee Population

Funds also flowed in, stimulating various consumer industries, such as department stores, entertainment, food and beverage, and transportation. Their turnover and profits have increased significantly. Due to the dense population, housing problems have arisen, and rents have risen daily. The long-depressed real estate industry has also become active, but only in small-scale real estate transactions for housing and factory use.

### Establishment of Foreign Exchange Black Market

After the establishment of the foreign exchange black market, the exchange rate decreased, and importers who had inventories made double profits, such as hardware, Western medicine, and woolen industries. Even those who suffered great losses during the war were often able to make up for them. Exporters also obtained good prices for their goods due to favorable exchange rates. For example, the silk cocoon industry, which has been depressed for many years, has shown signs of recovery this year due to the sharp rise in prices.

### Sharp Reduction in Goods Production

The sharp reduction in goods production has led to a situation of supply falling short of demand. For example, the cotton textile industry, due to the complete shutdown of yarn factories in the interior, has to rely on Shanghai for its cotton yarn. However, only yarn factories in the safe areas of the concessions are operating in Shanghai, so the demand far exceeds the supply, and the price of yarn has soared. The profit per bale often reaches hundreds of yuan, and the year-end profits are very substantial. Other industries, such as cotton weaving, silk weaving, iron industry, enamel industry, and match industry, also have the same phenomenon. Therefore, the establishment of small-scale new factories after the war has been very active.

### Obstruction of Transportation in Production Areas

The obstruction of transportation in production areas has led to a shortage of goods sources, and those with inventories have monopolized and hoarded goods. For example, cotton, dry cocoons, and raw cowhide industries have experienced shortages of goods sources, and prices have continued to rise. Those with large inventories have reaped huge profits. These factors have led to the abnormal prosperity of Shanghai today, which is a special phenomenon of the wartime economy. However, these reasons are mostly temporary in nature. Consumers cannot consume permanently, and producers cannot manipulate the supply. Moreover, the more the hinterland falls, the narrower the market becomes. Therefore, the economic prospects of Shanghai in the future should not be overly optimistic.

### Industry and Commerce in the Interior

Industry and commerce in the interior that have fallen into the war zone are all at a standstill, and the losses are huge and cannot be estimated. In the southwestern provinces, factories that have moved from the occupied areas have initially concentrated in Hankou from the Beijing-Shanghai area, and then gradually moved to the southwest with the factories in Wuhan. Although transportation is extremely difficult, they have finally reached their destinations, and some have already started manufacturing. Their spirit is commendable. In terms of commerce, in large cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming, the surface also shows a prosperous phenomenon due to the increase in population. Although the people are often under the threat of air raids, various industries have made progress. However, due to transportation difficulties, there is often a shortage of daily necessities, and local goods for export have become sluggish. Therefore, the development of the southwestern economy must focus on transportation infrastructure. At present, the government is actively building railways and highways and setting up various transportation facilities, so transportation will inevitably become more convenient in the future, and the development of the southwestern economy will be easier to carry out. In summary, it can be seen that the domestic economic environment has undergone significant changes due to the war.

### Foreign Economic Situation

As for the foreign economic situation, under the situation of tense diplomacy and arms race, the phenomenon of recession is more common. In the United Kingdom, the entire year was in a recession. According to the business activity index of the London School of Economics, it continued to fall from 111.0 in December of last year (with 1935 as 100) to 10.5 in December of this year, a decrease of about 10%. Prices have also fallen, and the number of unemployed people has increased. The reasons are that it was initially affected by the collapse of prices and the stock market in the United States, and then foreign trade became increasingly sluggish due to world political unrest, leading to a deterioration of the international balance of payments. The position of the pound sterling is very weak. In September, due to the Czech crisis, the exchange rate between the pound and the US dollar continued to fall, reaching more than 4.6 yuan. In the United States, the economic situation in the first half of the year remained sluggish after the stock market turmoil in the autumn of the previous year. However, after May, President Roosevelt once again expanded the budget and spent huge amounts of relief funds. Due to the increase in market chips, various industries gradually became active, and stock and commodity prices trended upward again. At the same time, the inventories of major commodities have decreased significantly since the production cuts last year, and the domestic and foreign preparations for war are becoming increasingly urgent, and the demand for military supplies is extremely high, so industrial production has been stimulated, and export trade has been slightly able to maintain the level of the previous year. The situation is better than in the United Kingdom. In France, prices continued to rise due to the devaluation of the franc, but the production index only increased slightly at the end of the year, and the number of unemployed people has not decreased. Moreover, due to the expansion of military preparations, the budget deficit has become increasingly large. At the end of this year, a new financial and economic plan was implemented, extending workers' working hours to increase production, reducing government spending, and improving tax revenue to achieve budget balance. The financial organization of the government has been strengthened to attract the return of funds. Various economic situations are in the process of adjustment. Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and other countries, under controlled economies, are taking preparations for war as their sole purpose, promoting various plans to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Improving the people's lives is no longer the current goal. Looking at the economic situation of various countries, although they are not as directly affected by the war as China, they have lost their normal development due to preparations for war and coping with the war. They are all sacrificing everything to seek the enrichment of military power. The hope for world peace in the future is almost non-existent. This is something that we cannot help but feel infinitely regretful after observing the domestic and foreign environment. (End)

### Construction of Balcony Causes Ceramic Pot to Break and Damage Car, Car Owner Sues for Compensation Elaborate Pretext to Exaggerate Claims, Awaiting Inspection of Car Body for Verification

The neighbor of Limin Textile Company on Taiwan Road (near Wufu Lane) is Jiandong Cotton Cloth Shop, opened by a Cantonese named Che Fengshi. Because the rent has been expensive in recent years, the shop converted the roof terrace, which displayed flowers and potted plants, into a house. This project was contracted by a Lu as foreman. On the afternoon of the 21st of last month, when the craftsmen were working, they moved the potted plants because they were obstructing construction. Unexpectedly, they all fell and hit the newly purchased car of Ma Shaoquan, the general manager of Limin Company, which was parked in front of the company. As a result, the ceramic pots were shattered, and the car was damaged. Ma immediately reported the incident to the local police, who inspected the scene and reported the incident to the Zhabei Police Station together with Che. After the head of the police questioned the circumstances of the incident, he ruled that since the car owner requested compensation, it was a civil matter and ordered him to pursue the matter himself. Ma then summoned a photographer to take pictures of the damage on that day and repaired the car. Che Fengshi initially agreed to compensate for the loss, but later refused to be responsible for the compensation because the amount of loss claimed by Ma was too large. Therefore, Ma hired Lawyer Wang to file a lawsuit against Che in the First Special Court, seeking a judgment ordering the defendant to compensate for the repair costs of 282 yuan in legal tender, the car rental fee of 150 yuan for hiring a car for ten days during the repair period, and 500 yuan for the loss caused by the fact that the car could not be restored to its original condition even after the repair, as well as litigation costs. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu held a court hearing and ordered the plaintiff to drive the car to the court for inspection at the next continued hearing for verification.

### Trial of Abduction of Young Girls Concluded

Deng Yangshi, an old woman from Jiangbei, Zhu Lushi, and Zhang Wangshi, a woman from Nanjing, who lived in a bungalow on Hart Road, colluded on the morning of April 25th at about 11 o'clock to deceive their neighbor, He Gendi, a young girl from Jiangbei, Gao Gendi, and Chen Xiuying, a woman from Tianjin, by falsely introducing them to work in a yarn factory in Yangshupu, and took them to a brothel founded by Feng Lushi, a woman from Funing, at No. 14 Zhihe Lane, Yunnan Road, where they were confined upstairs and forced into prostitution. The three girls did not want to receive guests and cried and made noise all day long. At 10:30 AM on the 26th, Feng Zhengbiao (a Chinese policeman from the Zhabei Police Station), the husband of Feng Lushi, who was from Xuzhou, came and released the three young girls. Subsequently, the Putuo Road Police Station sent detectives to arrest Deng Yangshi and Zhu Lushi and send them to the First Special Court. They confessed that Feng Zhengbiao and his wife were involved. The police added them to the position of the defendant and sent them to the Third Criminal Court the previous morning. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, filed a public prosecution based on the crimes of abduction and obstruction of freedom under the criminal law. Feng Zhengbiao hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. Judge Jiang Shuzi clearly interrogated the five male and female defendants, including Deng Yangshi, and ordered them to be returned to custody separately, with a date for the verdict to be announced.

### Pan Chengjiong Murder Case Suspect Arrested in Longgong Hotel

### Intention to Monopolize Inheritance Brothers Sue Each Other in Court Peaceful Settlement Expected, Procedures Not Yet Completed

Zheng Boju, a Cantonese, operated Hengtai and other pawnshops in Shanghai during his lifetime, accumulating assets of over one million yuan. He owned many properties in the central and northern districts of the Public Concession and in Zhabei in the Chinese area. Zheng had two wives, Shen and Weng, and a total of four sons, Jishen, Jihao, Jiqian, and Jijie, and three daughters, Sufang, Suchai, and Meiyu. After Zheng died of illness in August 1935, his estate was entrusted to his brother Zhongping to manage on his behalf, who took over a portion of it. Although the sons have negotiated, it has not been resolved so far. The remaining real estate deeds, savings books, stocks, and other documents are all in the hands of Jiqian, the third son who studied at the Soochow Law School. Jishen, the eldest son, united with his younger siblings and repeatedly asked him to hand over the full amount so that it could be divided according to the names. However, Jiqian initially made excuses and procrastinated. Later, unable to occupy it for a long time, he gathered everyone to divide it. After agreeing on the terms of the division and drafting a draft, he refused to sign it, hoping to overturn the agreement and monopolize it for a long time. Jishen and Jihao believed that Jiqian's attitude was malicious and intended to swallow the income from the estate, which was obvious. It was difficult to be deceived by him again, so they hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to file a lawsuit against Jiqian in the First Special District Local Court, detailing the facts of the defendant's seizure of various estates and delaying the analysis. Based on the provisions of the Civil Code for heirs inheriting the estate, they requested a judgment ordering the defendant (except for the retained portion for recovery) to hand over the seized property and divide it into four shares according to the conditions stated in the established property division contract, with each of the four brothers receiving one share, and ordering the defendant to bear the litigation costs. After the court held a hearing once before, it was postponed because both the plaintiff and the defendant intended to settle peacefully, so that they could settle it outside. The hearing date was again on the afternoon of the other day. Judge Gui asked about the situation of the two parties conducting peaceful settlement outside. Since the opinions of the two parties were very close and there was a possibility of peaceful settlement, all those named in the property division draft should be included in the peaceful settlement group of the case to avoid other complications in the future. Therefore, he ordered a change of date and asked the plaintiff and defendant to correct the documents and re-examine them.

### Puppet "Police Bureau" Black Eats Black Liu Jingwu Beaten with Military Sticks

According to reports from relevant sources, a tobacco smuggling case recently occurred in the puppet "Police Bureau Water Police Station." The whistleblower is Liu Jingwu, a puppet "police officer" from Liaoning. The case is currently being thoroughly investigated by the puppet "Police Headquarters." Recently, smugglers have been transporting tobacco in the Huangpu River, and the puppet "Water Police Team" sends "police officers" to inspect various debts every night. At 4 AM on the morning of the 3rd of this month, many smugglers were carrying a large amount of tobacco between the wharves of the British Taikoo Company and Longmao Foreign Firm in Pudong (ie, the Pudong Waterworks Wharf). Another gang of smugglers learned of this and went to rob the tobacco. Both sides had pistols and fired at each other. In the chaos, a lot of tobacco was thrown into the Huangpu River. Subsequently, Liu Jingwu, a "police officer" of the puppet "Water Police Team," arrested Xiao Yu, a robber, and Cang, a boatman transporting the tobacco, on the spot, and fished up ten packages of tobacco from the river, each weighing 100 taels, for a total of 1,000 taels, worth tens of thousands of yuan. They were taken to the puppet "Team" together. Unexpectedly, the robbers were released afterwards. Of the ten packages of tobacco seized, only four packages were handed over to the "Headquarters," and two of them were separated from one package, so only three packages were actually left. The whereabouts of the remaining seven packages (ie, 700 taels), worth tens of thousands of yuan, are unknown. Liu was very angry and reported the smuggling to the puppet "Municipal Government." The puppet "Director" Lu Ying was dispatched to investigate, but the whistleblower Liu Jingwu was beaten with 500 military sticks by the puppet Director Huo Liangchen and then detained. The case has not yet been resolved.

Also, at 6 AM yesterday morning, three bandits came to No. 458 Daxilu Road, Shanghai West, all armed with pistols. They frightened the people in the house and forbade them to make a sound. As a result, they stole 60 yuan in cash and fled.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's April Industrial Report 152 Accidents, Increased Living Standards for Workers

Last month, several larger factories applied for building permits from the Shanghai Municipal Council, including two dyeing factories, one soda factory, one wool spinning factory, and two weaving factories. Several factories also planned to expand their factory buildings. The Industrial Section of the Municipal Council conducted initial inspections of 38 factories, most of which were newly opened.

### Steam Pressure Machines

A total of 48 steam pressure machines were registered, all but three of which were boilers. A total of 61 installation certificates and 9 annual re-examination certificates were received. There are currently 604 boilers registered with the Industrial Section in various factories. When the Industrial Section sent personnel to inspect various boiler manufacturing plants, they found five boilers made with boiler plates that had not been tested and without qualified engineers to supervise them. They were immediately ordered to stop work. On the 11th of last month, a boiler exploded in a dyeing factory in the central district, causing serious injuries to two workers. The cause of the accident has been investigated and explained to the boiler operators at a meeting.

### Accidents

A total of 152 industrial and occupational accidents were reported. The causes of the accidents were known for sure in 135 cases. Detailed investigations were conducted, and the factories were ordered to adopt preventive measures in 35 cases. Two workers were seriously injured and died. There were 29 fires that occurred in factories or due to the manufacture of industrial products, resulting in 24 deaths and 29 injuries. Six of these were caused by improper use of celluloid, and seven occurred in textile factories.

### Industrial Management

Six seasoning powder factories under construction have prepared plans to eliminate the smell of hydrochloric acid. The Municipal Council considered one of the plans satisfactory. A glass factory adopted the recommendation of the Industrial Section and hired an expert who had just arrived in Shanghai from Vienna to plan the reorganization of the factory to improve working conditions.

### Group Training

The factory "old track" training class and the foreman training class are in progress. The courses taught include steam engine installation and maintenance, mechanical installation and maintenance, electrical installation and maintenance, machine factory practice, and worker management skills. They are explained by engineer Jin Zhixuan, Yan Li Niu, Hu Yunsheng, Shen Baochang, staff of the power company Yu (transliteration), and staff of the Bureau Shen and Ms. Zhu, respectively.

### Standard of Living

The general index of the standard of living of workers in the city continues to rise. The general index for last month was 164.13. If compared with the general index of 109.51 in July 1937 before the war, its reciprocal is 66.72. In other words, one yuan of national currency last month was equivalent to 6 jiao 6 fen 7 li 2 of national currency in July 1937 before the war. Except for a slight decrease in the fuel category, the fractional indices have increased by percentages ranging from 0.63 to 3.98. The food category has increased the most for rice and soybean oil.

### Fresh Pork is Detained and Interrogated, Survey of Vegetable Prices in the City

Economic Special Article on the So-Called "Huaxing Commercial Bank" and Its Role by Han Hui

The so-called "Huaxing Commercial Bank," jointly established by the Nanjing "Reformed Government" and Japanese banks, was founded in Shanghai amidst the plummeting market price of "Lian Yin" currency in Tianjin. According to Chen Jintao, the "President" of the bank, and Tsuda from the Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, "The bank's capital is 50 million yuan, half from the Japanese and half from the puppet regime. It will issue 'Huaxing currency' at the same value as legal tender, and it 'will be freely convertible into foreign currency.'" Tsuda also stated that "Japanese residents will be the first to use its banknotes." Some people find it incomprehensible that after the disastrous fall in the price of the "Lian Yin" currency in the north and its failure to replace legal tender, there is still an attempt to promote "Huaxing" currency in Shanghai and the Jiangnan region. In reality, this issue is not as simple as most people think and deserves careful examination.

The development process of imperialist economic aggression begins with commodity exports and progresses to capital exports. However, the era of capital exports does not stop commodity exports; it requires further expansion of commodity exports to increase capital accumulation. The purpose of capital exports is to manipulate the finance and industry of the colonies—especially the currency system. The so-called dollar bloc and sterling bloc are the most successful examples of capital exports. Japan, due to a lack of raw materials for heavy industry, has built its industrial base on light industry. The balance of international payments depends entirely on light industry and even the export of semi-finished agricultural products (such as silk cocoons). As for the export of capital, only the Northeast provinces have seen some success; otherwise, it cannot compete with the United States, Britain, and France. Moreover, its main raw materials for light industry, such as wool and cotton, still rely on imports from abroad. After the "September 18th Incident," the seizure of the four northeastern provinces of China did solve the shortage of raw materials for its heavy industry, but the scarcity of essential raw materials for light industry remained unresolved. To solve this problem, there was the movement to specialize Inner Mongolia and North China and the so-called "yen bloc" of Japan, "Manchukuo," and China. However, Japan's operation of the four northeastern provinces had already exhausted most of its capital, leaving it with no resources to realize this conspiracy. Furthermore, due to the success of the central legal tender policy and the firm support of the North China authorities, the so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and the yen bloc plan all failed. After the Japanese army occupied North China, the "United Reserve Bank," established by the "Provisional Government of Peiping," issued "Lian Yin" currency. The plan was to completely eliminate legal tender and make it the sole currency in the north, realizing its yen bloc conspiracy. However, in reality, the influence of legal tender in North China was not as weak as that of banknotes from the Fengtian era, so even with the backing of Japanese bayonets, the promotion of "Lian Yin" currency for over a year was limited to certain Japanese-occupied city strongholds and never became the sole currency in the north. There were many reasons for its failure, but generally speaking:

(1) Due to the prolonged Sino-Japanese war, excessive issuance of public bonds, and currency inflation, the price of the yen fluctuated, and the price of "Lian Yin" currency, linked to the yen, inevitably plummeted.

(2) Legal tender had sufficient reserves, and the recent establishment of a foreign exchange equalization fund has stabilized the "black market" in Shanghai, leading to widespread public confidence.

(3) The ruling power of the Japanese and puppet regimes was still confined to certain city strongholds, with most of the land still under the control of the central government.

(4) The attempt to seize silver in the Tianjin concession failed, and foreign banks in the United States, Britain, and France unanimously rejected "Lian Yin" currency.

(5) "Lian Yin" currency had no reserves, and the amount issued was enormous, leading to soaring prices and a disastrous fall in currency value. (The market price of counterfeit currency in Tianjin once fell to about 60% of the value of legal tender.)

(6) The recent victories of the central government's military counter-offensive.

Therefore, "Lian Yin" currency was only barely circulating in the Japanese-occupied cities of the north, and once it entered the countryside, it became the world of legal tender, leaving no room for "Lian Yin" currency to circulate. Japan's conspiracy to issue "Lian Yin" currency to replace legal tender can be said to have failed in the north. However, it has been quite effective in controlling foreign exchange, restricting import and export trade, and promoting the sales of Japanese goods through the use of "Lian Yin," as evidenced by the sharp increase in imports of Japanese goods and the sharp decrease in imports of European and American goods in the first quarter of this year.

When the Japanese army initially occupied Shanghai and the Jiangnan region the year before last, it forced the use of some military scrip. Its original intention was that once these military scrips were used in the occupied areas, it would only need to pay some printing costs to exchange them for huge amounts of agricultural products for its light industry's raw materials and food supplies, thus saving its collapsing economic structure. However, after Chinese merchants collected this military scrip, they quickly went to Shanghai or other commercial ports to buy Japanese goods from Japanese merchants. Although the import of Japanese goods was increasing rapidly, its goal of obtaining industrial raw materials and food for free was not achieved, and it instead gave up the foreign exchange export resources that could have been obtained. Although Japanese small and medium-sized merchants dared not openly refuse military scrip, they were already complaining. Japan's original intention was that this military scrip could alleviate its malignant currency inflation crisis, but now it has completely failed. Therefore, the "Huaxing Bank" established this time is formally different from the "Lian Yin" in the north, mainly in two aspects:

First, the difference in nature: "Lian Yin" was jointly formed by the "Beijing Provisional Government" and by forcing northern banks to participate, while "Huaxing" is invested by the "Nanjing Reformed Government" and the six major Japanese banks. Although the former could establish credit loans from the Bank of Korea, it was not directly invested by Japanese banks, while the latter is clearly jointly owned by the six major Japanese banks. The addition of the words "Commercial" after "Huaxing" also makes it different from the so-called "national bank" nature of "Lian Yin."

Second, the difference in currency value: "Lian Yin" currency was at par with the yen and was intended to replace legal tender (its failure has been mentioned above), while "Huaxing" currency is said to be prepared to replace legal tender and is not linked to the yen.

As for the role of issuing "Huaxing currency," it can be summarized in the following four points:

(1) Japan uses "Huaxing" currency in Japanese-occupied areas to exchange legal tender and absorb foreign exchange in the Shanghai "black market," eroding the reserves of legal tender to increase its ability to pay for its war expenses in China.

Japan wants to use "Huaxing" currency to plunder industrial raw materials and food in the occupied areas for a long time without limitation, and refuse Chinese merchants to directly purchase Japanese goods with "Huaxing" currency, so that Japanese small and medium-sized merchants will not suffer the pain of receiving military scrip again.

(3) The Japanese and puppet regimes use "Huaxing" currency to pay part of the expenses of the Japanese troops stationed in China and the expenses of the puppet organizations, in order to make up for the financial panic on both sides.

(4) "Huaxing" Bank may become Japan's agency for controlling foreign exchange and foreign trade in Shanghai and the Jiangnan region. It will force export merchants to sell foreign exchange to "Huaxing," thereby enriching yen reserves and promoting the import of Japanese goods by utilizing the occupation of the Yangtze River and inland river transportation, squeezing out the market for European and American goods. In other words, it wants to increase its capital accumulation by expanding commodity exports.

The above four roles can be said to be progressing simultaneously, and their ultimate goal is nothing more than to exclude the economic interests of Britain and the United States, undermine the legal tender system, and complete its delusion of incorporating the Shanghai financial market into the yen bloc. However, this kind of purpose has no possibility of being realized.

First, if "Huaxing" currency is used to redeem legal tender, because the credit of legal tender is stable and the amount of "Huaxing" currency issued is unlimited, the people in the occupied areas will inevitably hoard legal tender and raise the price of legal tender, and the disastrous fall in the price of "Huaxing" currency is inevitable.

Second, as a result of the excessive issuance of "Huaxing" currency, prices in the occupied areas will inevitably rise: not only will the progress of Japan's purchase of agricultural products in Jiangnan to supplement industrial raw materials and food be hampered, but also due to the reduction in purchasing power of the people in the occupied areas, the import of Japanese goods will be drastically reduced.

Third, the disastrous fall in the value of "Huaxing" currency and the soaring prices will inevitably lead to the bankruptcy of Chinese merchants in the war zone. The puppet organizations that rely on urban merchants will inevitably become more panicked financially, and the Japanese army's method of local supply will inevitably become more difficult.

Fourth, if Japan uses "Huaxing" Bank to control foreign exchange in Shanghai, it will be difficult to succeed from the objective environment.

The above contradictions are the inevitable results of the issuance of "Huaxing" currency, which will not only fail to help the Japanese economic structure but will accelerate its collapse. Japan has also seen this crisis, so it has not yet confirmed the plan to control foreign exchange in Shanghai, and wants to use other means to induce cooperation between Chinese and European and American merchants. The hope of its success is even more slim. Therefore, although there was a preliminary "founding meeting," there has been no follow-up so far, which shows the high degree of self-doubt.

### The Second Recording of This Journal's Forum: The Question of Price Balancing (Continued)

Date: April 26th, 10:00 AM
Location: Conference Hall on the Fifth Floor of this Newspaper
Wang Yutong: Although Shanghai has formed a unique environment, the rapid increase in population and the soaring prices have a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. Moreover, Shanghai is still the economic center of China during the war. Therefore, in addition to the commodities that have been manipulated by certain forces, we urgently need to find ways to stabilize Shanghai's prices. The responsibility for the entire wartime economy is far more than what can be described by the following starting points of morality and maintaining social order and tranquility. The proposed control methods are listed in three points:
1.  From a moral starting point, each trade association should implement individual autonomous control based on the actual supply and demand relationship of goods and in the spirit of national service.
2.  For the sake of maintaining social order and tranquility, each public group should jointly request the municipal authorities to order each trade association to jointly and conscientiously study control methods, such as the previous balancing of rice prices, which is one example.
3.  Actively seek substitutes and encourage the invention of substitutes.
Zhang Ziyun: The main reason for the current rise in prices is the decrease in production. At the same time, if consumption can be automatically reduced, the trend of rising prices can be slowed down. Therefore, promoting a frugal movement among the people is also a way to balance prices.
Liu Xingchen: The prices of agricultural products in rural areas are generally declining, while urban prices are rising uniformly. This is due to the obstruction of the flow of goods. Therefore, to talk about balance, opening up the transportation lines is the first priority. At the same time, rural prices should also be increased.
Li Quanshi: That's right, we must rely on local products.
Zhu Sihuang: The financial industry can make some contributions to rent issues. Because in addition to owning their own properties, silver houses are often entrusted to manage rental properties. From the perspective of managing rental properties, they can mediate between landlords and tenants. When they encounter a landlord asking them to handle rent increases, they can say a few fair words from the sidelines, advising both parties to reach a fair and reasonable solution.
In addition to the silver industry, the courts should also use their power of judgment on rent increase issues and strive for true justice. Then, rent disputes can also be resolved to a large extent.
Li Quanshi: If the Municipal Council can restrict the influx of people from other places into Shanghai, such as refugees, the prices in Shanghai can be lowered. But in reality, this is absolutely impossible because humanitarianism and compassion are common to all mankind.
Zhu Sihuang: Rising prices are not entirely harmful. For example, rising prices of foreign goods can reduce the import of non-essential goods, and rising prices of luxury goods can reduce waste. However, rising prices of daily necessities greatly affect people's livelihoods. Therefore, the policy of stabilizing prices does not need to be to return all prices to the same level. The higher the price of luxury goods, the better. Only appropriate adjustments to the prices of necessities are needed. As for the policy of stabilizing the prices of necessities, although it is difficult, it is not entirely without hope. Here are some of my personal views:
1.  The government should adjust supply and demand as much as possible within its capabilities. Although the government has moved west, it is still concerned about the economic situation in the occupied areas. For example, the government and the people are very cautious about the resumption of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The people of Shanghai have not diminished their patriotism. Therefore, the government should still control as much as possible within its capabilities.
2.  Merchants should initiate a voluntary fair-price movement. Trade associations and the Chamber of Commerce should jointly agree on fair-price measures and abide by them. These organizations are indeed institutions representing the interests of various industries, but there are many insightful people in each industry. Even if they do not consider the people's livelihood, they should know that if prices rise too quickly, they will fall back more severely in the future. Only focusing on current interests will create future failures. Therefore, for the sake of the interests of each industry itself, they should also broaden their horizons and have each trade association automatically agree on a fair-price plan, cracking down on hoarding, speculation, and manipulation, which is precisely to protect their future interests. Moreover, the Chamber of Commerce has the nature of a local public welfare institution, and should also consider the interests of the people's livelihood and take the lead in advocating this.
3.  Promote thrift. Promoting thrift is to reduce unnecessary consumption. On the one hand, it can use the power of consumers to resist the manipulation of suppliers.
4.  The financial industry should pay attention to lending. The contraction and expansion of credit in the financial industry has a great impact on prices. Therefore, close attention should be paid to loans and discounts, and credit should not be used to subsidize hoarding and fuel speculation. Currently, the financial industry is generally very cautious about lending. In short, the financial industry cannot shirk its responsibility for stabilizing prices.

### The Sugar Market Situation Amid Rising Prices by Zhu Gengxin

The author is the person in charge of Shanghai Xinyi Company and a well-known domestic sugar merchant. This article was originally a written report prepared for the price forum held by this journal. It discusses the prospects of the domestic and foreign sugar markets and the differences in sugar prices, allowing us to gain a correct understanding of the price trends of this major flavoring ingredient. We hope readers will pay attention to it. Editor

Recently, sugar prices in Shanghai have been rising sharply, partly because domestic sources have decreased and partly because the cost of foreign sugar is expensive. Before the war, Guangdong machine-made white sugar accounted for 300,000 metric tons annually, but it has now disappeared. Due to transportation difficulties, Min and Guang local sugar used to account for 500,000 to 600,000 dan (white sugar accounted for only 10-20%), but now it is only 300,000 metric tons. Dutch sugar (i.e., produced in Java) is more expensive due to the black market exchange rate. Due to these two reasons, prices have increased.

However, the Hong Kong Taikoo Sugar Refinery is operating quite prosperously at this time. Currently, white sugar, Javanese raw sugar, and Taikoo refined sugar account for 80% of the sales in Shanghai. Qing sugar relies entirely on local products from Min and Guang; Dutch sugar accounts for 20% of red sugar, and Min and Guang sugar accounts for 80%; rock sugar is all made in China, with Shanghai factories accounting for 80% and Xiamen factories accounting for 20%. Regarding Shanghai white sugar, although the market price is expensive, it is still relatively cheap compared to overseas prices. According to world production, cane sugar and beet sugar each account for half; among cane sugar, Cuba, Java, and India are the largest producers. This year, India's domestic production and sales are short by more than 300,000 tons; it has purchased from Java and European markets. This year, Japan and Taiwan's production has increased by more than one million dan compared to previous years. In addition to domestic sales, the rest is dumped in the Far East and North China; sales in Central China are minimal. Although the Shanghai Minghua factory is refining, only small merchants are selling it, and its domestic market price is even higher than that of Shanghai. In the past, in addition to Taiwan, the raw materials for Japanese sugar factories were purchased from Java and Cuba to make up for the shortage; now, due to restrictions on foreign exchange, they cannot be purchased freely, so production is not high. As for European beet sugar, Germany is the first; this year's production is more than 2 million tons, but it is now being prepared for military needs by various countries and is becoming increasingly insufficient; it is planned to purchase sugar cane-made sugar from sugar cane-producing areas to supplement it. Looking at overseas sugar prices, they are also trending higher. The reason why Shanghai cannot rise to the overseas level is that during the Anti-Japanese War, foreign shipping lines have not been interrupted, and sources are still open, but domestic transportation is blocked and sales are difficult, resulting in a situation of oversupply.

Southern China is originally a sugar-producing area. It is hoped that the government will encourage sugar cane planting and protect small-scale industries so that all villages have the ability to produce, and annual production will increase. It can supply Shanghai sales as much as possible, so the Shanghai market does not need to rely on foreign sugar anymore.

### Supply and Demand Conditions of Yarn and Cloth Amid Rising Prices by Wang Fuli

The author is one of the persons in charge of China Cotton Industry and Hengjian Yarn Factory. This article was originally a written report prepared for the price forum held by this journal. It speaks from an insider's perspective, and every sentence is practical. We hope readers will pay attention to it. Editor

Since the start of the Anti-Japanese War, yarn and cloth prices have skyrocketed. The highest value of 20-count Jincheng yarn once reached 515 yuan per piece, more than doubling compared to before the war. The prices of various thick and thin fabrics have also doubled accordingly. Although prices once fell due to the fall of Guangzhou, they soon gradually rebounded. To this day, they still maintain a considerable high price. Factors such as foreign exchange tightening, transportation difficulties, and increased costs are all related; however, the most important reason is that textile factories have been affected by the war, with some stopping or being destroyed, resulting in reduced production and a shortage of supply. You can get an idea of the general situation by reading the following.

The textile factories located in China can be divided into three types according to their operators: Chinese, Japanese, and British. The number of yarn spindles and looms they owned before the war is shown in the first table.

First Table (Excerpt from the List of Chinese Yarn Factories published by the United Association of Chinese Yarn Factories in July 1937)

(A) Chinese

Location	Number of Factories	Number of Spindles	Number of Looms

Shanghai	31	1,114,408	8,754

Jiangsu	23	615,548	7,288

Hebei	7	174,896	1,490

Henan	7	314,472	3,259

Other Provinces	28	517,068	4,712

Total	96	2,746,392	25,503

(B) Japanese

Location	Number of Factories	Number of Spindles	Number of Looms

Shanghai	30	1,331,421	17,283

Other Ports	18	803,658	11,632

Total	48	2,135,068	28,915

(C) British

Location	Number of Factories	Number of Spindles	Number of Looms

Shanghai	4	221,336	4,021

(D) Total of Chinese and Foreign Merchants

Location	Number of Factories	Number of Spindles	Number of Looms

National	148	5,102,798	58,439

During this war, most factories have been affected, with the exception of a few, some almost completely ceasing operations. After the war moved west, some began to plan for resumption. The British merchants belong to a third country, and their textile factories have hardly been damaged, and they have now all resumed operations. It is estimated that the Japanese merchants have lost 750,000 spindles and 11,500 looms. As for the Chinese textile factories, because most of them are in the occupied areas, not only is it impossible to resume work, but also the extent of the damage is unknown. However, according to Japanese newspapers, under the name of "military management" in North China, the Chinese factories operated and put into operation by Japanese merchants are shown in the second table.

In Central China, the Chinese factories were first distributed autonomously by Japanese merchants, and those approved by their military department are 40 factories, and the number of their spindles and looms is shown in the third table.

Third Table (Survey in December 1938)

Note: The factory marked with the "※" symbol is jointly operated with Taian Company.

Although the above factories have been approved by the military department and are operated by certain Japanese merchants, some of them are still occupied by the military department, or contain complex international elements. As of the end of last year, 336,124 spindles and 2,344 looms had been opened, and the number of spindles and looms opened by the factories originally owned by Japanese merchants is shown in the fourth table.

Adding the Chinese factories that are under their "military management", the number is shown in the fifth table.

Referring to the first table (B) and the fifth table, it can be seen that the number of spindles and looms opened by Japanese merchants is sufficient to match the pre-war situation, while the number owned by Chinese merchants has been greatly reduced. You can see it by reading the sixth table.

Comparing the sixth table with the first table (A), the reduction rate is shown in the seventh table. (To be continued)

### Commercial News Finance

English Pure Gold Remains Stable

The cash price of Chihchih in the black market did not change yesterday due to the Sunday holiday and the low attendance of members. We heard that there were no transactions in the retail departments of money exchange companies, and the price was around the closing price of the previous day. 2,127 yuan were sold, and 23 yuan were received.
The exchange rate of gold jewelry in silver shops has also not changed. Da Tong Hang quoted 215 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang quoted 213 yuan. The purchase price was 207 yuan in both.

London, May 13th. English pure gold is stable, remaining at £7 8s 5½d per ounce. Large bars unchanged.

London, May 13th. The silver market saw a few purchases from India, and the market was quite stable. The prices of large silver bars for near and far terms were unchanged.

The market is calm, with a total of 25 transactions.

### Huaxing Opening: Rumored for Tomorrow, Therefore Maintaining Lianchao

It is rumored that the "Huaxing" Bank will open tomorrow (16th). It is divided into seven sections internally, and the heads are all Japanese. Even the tea servers are mostly Japanese. The people recommended by Liang and Chen can hardly get important positions, and the result will be that they are idle, eating and getting paid for doing nothing. Banknotes are the main purpose of establishing the bank, and they will inevitably be issued. However, according to financial circles, since this banknote has no reserves, it will inevitably not be able to purchase foreign exchange. If it is used to seek foreign exchange through roundabout means, it will be unfavorable to the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange, which will not be a blessing for Chinese and foreign merchants. Therefore, foreign merchants will definitely not accept it. Apart from this, it will seek foreign exchange from the commodity side to promote the circulation of the banknote, but the result will only be to achieve barter. However, in order to issue "Huaxing" banknotes, the "Lianchao" in North China has recently been vigorously raised to more than 80% of its face value. The intention is to maintain "Lianchao" to help "Huaxing" issue banknotes, but after the fall, the trick has long been seen through.

Beijing Newsletter: Recently, due to the sharp drop in the value of counterfeit banknotes in the Ping City, the prices of various commodities have soared. Taking rice and flour as an example, the selling price of rice has reached 30 yuan per dan, and the price of flour has reached 7 yuan per bag. The pseudo "Provisional Government" has failed in its original plan to destroy legal tender. The ban on the use of legal tender since March 10 has recently been lifted, and legal tender is allowed to continue to be used, intending to use this opportunity to absorb the people's legal tender with "Lian Yin" banknotes. The excuse is that the people still have a large amount of legal tender, and in order to avoid losses to the people, the ban is lifted for two months.

### Grain: Wushan Rice Still Transportable, Japonica Rice Traded Verbally

The sources of Do-japonica rice from various gangs and the Jiangxia area totaled 11,000 to 12,000 bags from the Nangang gang. The Su-Tong gang delivered 2,500 to 2,600 bags of steamed buns by train. As the arrival of goods gradually increased, and the Evaluation Committee repeatedly announced strict price limits, invited the concession authorities and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to participate, and planned to purchase foreign rice to open up sources, people's sentiment slightly improved. It is rumored that Wuhu can also be shipped, and there is a rumor that 10,000 bags will be shipped out soon. Therefore, the eagerness of customers to go has relaxed. High-quality goods and polished rice are sold together at 14 yuan, and thick and thin japonica rice is traded secretly, seemingly openly. Do-japonica rice is rumored to be sold at 16.5 yuan, and Nan-japonica rice is sold at 16 to 16.3 yuan. Other high-quality thin rice is also sold at 16 to 16.5 yuan, but the situation has faded, not as excited as the previous market. As for inferior goods, they are still sold at 15 yuan. Moreover, most of these secret trades are verbal transactions, so it is impossible to conduct a real investigation; one can only rely on the morality of each person. Do-foreign-pointed rice is still lacking in the market, and Bianyuan rice and foreign glutinous rice are all held at the original price.
Although there is a rumor that certificates for moving out and banning the transportation of passenger indica rice have been stopped, the roads to Shanghai have been continuous and have not been interrupted in recent days. According to Wuhu news, it can be shipped out by finding ways. Yesterday, another 5,000 to 6,000 bags arrived, and the prices of rough rice made from Wuhu indica rice have fallen by 10 to 20 cents across the board, and Beijing indica rice has also returned to the same level. However, the secret price of high-quality Beijing indica rice still needs 14.5 yuan, and Wuhu indica rice is around 14 yuan, with varying prices for medium and inferior quality.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fluctuate

The British Sugar Industry Conference has not yet made a decision.

Although the proposal to increase Cuba's production by 200,000 tons has not been passed, the seller still plans to find a suitable proposal to help. If it can proceed smoothly, the meeting can be closed this Wednesday, so sugar prices are likely to change a lot in the next few days. Yesterday, London reported that the near and far terms were both down by 2/8d, with August at 7 shillings and 3 pence, December at 6 shillings and 3.25 pence, and March next year at 6 shillings and 3.75 pence. Hong Kong reported that the cost of packaging to Shanghai has decreased by half a yuan to 20 yuan. As a result, the public market has weakened again. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar is down by 10 cents, with the price at our own shop at 27.6 yuan and the price at other shops at 27.4 yuan. The price of transit goods has dropped even more, with newly arrived goods at 19.4 to 19.3 yuan, with 300 bags traded, and customs goods at 19.2 yuan, with 500 bags traded, and then at 19 yuan, with 500 bags traded. Dutch red sugar and local cotton white sugar have not changed. Taikoo car white sugar is down by 20 cents, with the price of B-mark at 27.2 yuan, and so on. The domestic sugar market is also fluctuating, with a weak trend. Only the Chao gang has released dozens of bags of inferior cotton white sugar at 24.6 yuan. The price of diao sugar is too harsh, and no transaction has been made.

### Seafood: Second Batch of New Yantai Shrimp Tails, Selling Price Reduced by 22 Yuan

Yantai Island Shrimp Tails: Seeing the new beginning, more have recently arrived. The quality of the goods is better than before. Yesterday, the opening market price was 118 yuan. As the weather is gradually warming and it is not easy to store, the market trend has weakened. The first batch was 140 yuan, and it has now fallen by 22 yuan.

### Coal: Fine Coal Transactions Are Sluggish

The sales of fine coal were still smooth last month, and the arrival of goods from various places was continuous. However, recently the needs of factories have gradually been met, and retail sales in front of the shops are also limited, resulting in sporadic transactions in the market. Daily transactions are less than 1,000 tons. Self-dismantling by the same industry is calculated as follows: Indian fine coal is 40 yuan per ton, Kaiping special fine coal is 41 yuan, and Yuanshan fine coal is 24 yuan. The above are all warehouse shipments, and the labor costs of the porters are added separately.

### Medicinal Materials: Lily Slices Are Running Low

The sales of lily slices are approaching the peak season. It is found that there were dozens of bags that arrived last time, and they were quickly swept away by the Hong Kong, Shantou, and medicine gangs, and the price reached 31-32 yuan. There is no continuation of arrivals, and the inventory is becoming more depleted. The industry is slightly holding back inventory, and the wild price is 35-36 yuan, and there is still a lack of high-quality goods on the market. According to a survey in the producing area, the inventory has been exhausted, and it is necessary to wait for the new products before they can be transported to Shanghai. However, the date of the new products is still far away, and there may be a shortage in the Shanghai market.

### Review of the Essence of Love: Also Where the Techniques of Love Lie

Love is the art of mankind, with infinite mysteries and beauty, which can make people quietly appreciate it, nurture their emotions, and inspire people's courage and strive for success. Therefore, the influence of love on life is very significant. Then, what is the essence of love? This is worth our review.

The essence of love, we can simply say, is selfish, but at the same time it is sacrificial. Selfishness is for oneself and also for enjoyment. Indeed, whether male or female, their ardent pursuit of lovers and yearning for marriage is nothing more than for their own happiness in life. Because of physiological needs, both men and

### U.S. Foreign Trade Week: Seeking to Recover Declining Business in China; Considering Actions to Counter Japan

According to the English-language "China Press," optimistic American merchants in Shanghai will hold a U.S. Foreign Trade Week starting on the 21st of this month. Faced with the most severe commercial situation since the opening of treaty ports, they are determined to find the most appropriate solutions. The Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce is in charge of this week's events. According to the Chamber's report, since 1937, Japan's

Trade in Occupied Areas of China Has Increased Sharply,

while trade between China and third countries such as the United States has declined sharply. This Foreign Trade Week is scheduled to conclude on the 27th of this month. American merchants will hold various meetings during the week to consider actions to counter Japan's potential expansion of foreign exchange controls and monopolization of imports and exports at various ports. The American Chamber of Commerce report referred to Guangzhou and Hankou as "dead cities." Regarding

the Yangtze River Basin

commerce, Shanghai's efforts are ultimately futile and unproductive. The Chinese government now relies on supplies from Vietnam, Burma, and the Soviet Union. In 1938, Japan supplied 65% of imports to North China and 46% of imports to all of China, seizing the leading position previously held by American trade. Another report, describing the situation at the end of 1938, stated that Japan implemented a

Yen Bloc

scheme for trade in Manchuria and North China. Apart from Japan, the prospects for trade with China from major countries are bleak. In December 1938, U.S. exports to China were 60% lower than before the war, while Japanese exports to China increased by 31%. In the same month, Chinese exports to the U.S. were 51% lower than in June 1937, while exports to Japan increased by 34%.

### Ningbo Bombed Seven Times: Night Market Shortened; Rice Prices Rise Steadily; Efforts to Stabilize Prices

Since Ningbo was first bombed on the 28th of last month, it has been continuously ravaged on the 1st, 2nd, 9th, 10th, and 12th of this month, suffering a total of seven devastating attacks. The inner and outer city areas have been almost completely bombed. Commercial transactions can only be conducted at night to avoid the fires of war.

Night Market Shortened

According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the Ningbo night market was previously scheduled from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM. However, starting the day before yesterday, it has been shortened to 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM. The trading time is only two and a half hours. The bleak and desolate scene reflects the situation. It is reported that the prices of daily necessities, vegetables, and food are still rising.

People's Hearts Settling Down

The local people are extremely settled. Although few people are seen during the day, most return in the evening, making the nightlife relatively lively. The administration of various government agencies is proceeding as usual. The police are on duty day and night, taking shifts on time. Inland river transportation is maintained without obstruction or stagnation.

Rice Prices

Because food rice reserves are not abundant, and some are taking the opportunity to hoard for better prices, rice prices are steadily rising, reaching around 20 yuan. Therefore, the authorities are dredging sources and applying pressure to stabilize prices, and cracking down on manipulation, so it is believed that market prices will tend to recover.

Tribute Rice Prepared

The Ningbo Association in Shanghai, at the request of the people of their hometown, has arranged for 50,000 bags of Saigon rice for relief. It is now known that this rice has been prepared and will be loaded and shipped to Ningbo as soon as ships travel between Shanghai and Ningbo to carry out price stabilization.

### Japanese Transport Ships on Huangpu River Suddenly Increase; Sixteen Transport Ships; Plus Two Destroyers

Recently, the number of Japanese transport ships on the Huangpu River has suddenly increased significantly, with their sterns connected to each other. It has been found that there are a total of sixteen ships, including Xinyang, Tokyo, Kyokuto, Wuling, Fuyang, Xinsheng, Beiguang, Nichiyo, Eisun, Toyo, Juhou, Wonsan, Wolpo, Keijin, Daimoto, and the Third Akomaru. In addition, the flagship Izumo is still docked at the Mitsubishi Wharf. There are also the destroyer No. 1 of the First Destroyer Squadron and the destroyer Asuga, which were sent to rescue the Malacca Maru, which ran aground 120 miles from Shanghai.

### Western Newspaper Reports Another Political Kidnapping; Chongqing Agent Abducted on Haig Road

The "China Press" reported yesterday (the 13th) that there was another rumored political kidnapping, but it could not be confirmed. According to Chinese sources, a man named Jensen, believed to be an agent from Chongqing, was abducted by armed men in a car at 5 a.m. yesterday on Haig Road. No further details have been obtained so far.

### French Commemorate Joan of Arc's Birthday with Solemn Ceremony; French Consulate Raised Flag Yesterday; Formal Mass Held

The "Shanghai Times" reported that the French community in Shanghai will hold a ceremony today (the 14th) to commemorate the birthday of the heroine Joan of Arc. At 9:30 a.m., a large number of army and navy officers, diplomats, and French citizens went to the French Consulate to attend the flag-raising ceremony. Then, at 10:00 a.m., a formal mass was held in the St. Joseph's Church on Rue du Consulat. Joan of Arc's birthday is actually May 11th, but for the past ten years, the French have often commemorated it on the first Sunday after May 11th.

### Post Office Resumes Parcel Service to Dinghai and Yongjia; Temporarily Suspends Acceptance of Parcels Along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway

The Shanghai Postal Administration previously suspended the acceptance of all parcels, large and small, to various places in eastern Zhejiang due to the disruption of traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang and transportation difficulties. Now that shipping between Shanghai and Dinghai and Shanghai and Wenzhou has resumed, the Bureau has issued a notice stating, "Effective immediately, all large parcels to Dinghai and Yongjia can be accepted again. This is hereby notified." As for Ningbo, only personal medicines and lightweight small packages are accepted. In addition, the service will not resume for counties and cities in eastern Zhejiang such as Shaoxing, Yuhang, Shangyu, and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway such as Jinhua, Zhuji, and Xiaoshan, whether large or small parcels.

### Chinese Troops in the Eastern Theater Ready to Clear Out Bandits; Disputes Over Salt in Fengxian Lead to Bandit Infighting; 45th Brigade Takes the Opportunity to Resolve the Situation

It is reported that the first step for the Chinese troops in the Eastern Theater is to clear out the bandits operating under false pretenses, in order to resolve the "false" bandits who have lost their integrity and are seeking opportunities. On the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, from Nanjing to Wuxi, the area has been largely cleared and is under the control of regular troops. Militarily, things are progressing smoothly. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the area from the Qiantang River crossing to Zhapu and Pinghu to Jiashan has also been cleared. The 62nd Division and the 45th Brigade are responsible for Punan and Pudong. Recently, there has been a dispute over the salt factory in Fengxian, leading to large-scale infighting among bandits in Nanhui and Fengxian. Therefore, the 45th Brigade took the opportunity to resolve the situation. From now on, the lineup will be unified under the main body of the Central Army, and the plainclothes teams will be changed to people's self-defense forces to assist. Therefore, the war situation will be fresh.

### Fresh Pork Supply Cut Off; Meat Industry Closed Today; 500 Meat Stalls Closed; Awaiting Handling by Concession Authorities

After the fresh pork industry declared its position, fresh pork transported to Shanghai has been repeatedly illegally seized at the Hongkou Livestock Market, leading vendors to fear transporting pork to Shanghai. The sources have been cut off. The New Ninghai Slaughterhouse in the International Settlement, the Suxi Slaughterhouse, and the slaughterhouse in the French Concession all stopped slaughtering pigs yesterday morning. More than 2,000 fresh meat stores and stalls in the two concessions have no meat to sell from today and have implemented a market closure, but will not close their doors to maintain the appearance of the concessions. Restaurants have announced that "the supply of fresh pork has been cut off, the meat industry is closed, and there is no meat to offer." As many as 500 meat stalls in the small vegetable markets in the two concessions have voluntarily closed. The fresh pork industry, slaughterhouses, and fresh meat industry are all waiting for the concession authorities to handle the aftermath.

### Product Exhibition Opens Today; Yuan Lvdeng Presides Over Opening Ceremony; Public Exhibition of Chinese Goods

Before the war, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce organized a Product Exhibition Hall, and the Bureau of Social Affairs and the People's Education Center operated a National Goods Exhibition Hall. Due to environmental factors, they have been closed one after another. Distant merchants who want to visit national product samples have no way to inquire, and the general public in the city who want to recognize national products also suffer from not being able to distinguish them. In view of this, the Association decided to hold the Shanghai Product Exhibition, and determined the new Shanghai Market on Jing'an Temple Road and Moore Road as the venue. It is scheduled for three weeks, and a Product Review Committee has been organized to review the exhibits one by one and issue National Goods Honorary Certificates to encourage them.

Exhibited Products

The total number of products exhibited by the Association in this session is no less than 10,000, including clothing, food, and daily necessities necessary for life, such as educational supplies, hygiene products, electrical appliances, textiles, food, shirts, socks, cosmetics, medicines, etc., everything should be available. Especially now that it is summer, the products of major pharmaceutical factories and major pharmacies are the most numerous.

### Continuous Fighting: Pinghu Flights Suspended

Inland waterway flights from Shanghai to Pinghu, which had just resumed recently, were suspended again yesterday. According to sources in the inland waterway shipping industry, fighting has been taking place in the Pinghu area for days, and the situation is quite tense. A civil vessel that departed the day before yesterday was also stopped and returned. Land and water flights from Shanghai to various parts of western Zhejiang have been completely suspended.

### After the Resumption of Navigation on the Wenzhou and Dinghai Lines, Transportation Between Shanghai and Ningbo Can Still Be Maintained; Transportation Between Wenzhou, Dinghai, and Ningbo Continues Normally by Sailing Ships, Launches, and Automobiles

Since Ningbo was repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, the Japanese seem to be more active in the military situation in Ningbo, and all voyages, regardless of nationality, have been prevented from advancing, causing the sudden interruption of transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo. Since the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Dinghai lines have successively resumed shipping, transportation between Wenzhou and Ningbo and between Dinghai and Ningbo can still be achieved by sailing ships, launches, or road vehicles. Therefore, although the direct Shanghai-Ningbo line has not been smooth, it can be indirectly transported through these two lines.

Rumors of Release of German Vessels

The four vessels detained by the Japanese: De Ping of the Italian-Chinese Company, Shangdeng of the German Rulin Trading Company, Tianbao of the Shiyide Trading Company, and Weijin of the Xiangsha Trading Company, now, except for the De Ping of the Italian-Chinese Company, which was released on the evening of the 12th of this month after negotiations by the Italian Consulate and sailed back to Roosevelt Wharf to dock, are under review. The vessel is scheduled to depart from Shanghai tonight directly to Wenzhou, and it is expected that there will be no obstacles in the future. Regarding the three German vessels, Gaodeng, Tianbao, and Qijin, after repeated negotiations by the German Consulate in Shanghai, it is widely rumored in the shipping industry that the Japanese have agreed to release the three vessels. Yesterday morning was a regular holiday and the office was closed. The Japanese naval authorities will be notified to release them in the next day or two. We will decide on the date of sailing to Wenzhou after the release.

Hana Successfully Sailed to Dinghai Twice

The German merchant Yuandong Company's vessel Hana, after the first resumption of shipping on the Shanghai-Dinghai line on the 3rd of this month and returning to Shanghai, was repeatedly postponed because the cargo transportation procedures with Dinghai had not yet been completed. After the various procedures were resolved, the vessel sailed from Shanghai to Dinghai for the second time on the 12th of this month. It was inspected by Japanese warships during the voyage and then sailed to Dinghai. According to a report from the company last night, the Hana is expected to return to Shanghai today. It is scheduled to depart at 4:00 pm, and the voyage is going smoothly.

Passengers and Goods on Shanghai-Wenzhou Line Must Be Guaranteed

According to sources in the shipping industry, the authorities have allowed the resumption of the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, but in order to prevent espionage, traitors, smuggling of private goods, and the export of local goods, the restrictions on passengers and goods are very strict. It has been decided to handle it in accordance with the previously established navigation regulations. Passengers traveling from Shanghai to Wenzhou must have a guarantee from a local well-established merchant. Because explosive devices are buried in the port, ships entering the port must be guided by a pilot. No loading or unloading of passengers and goods is allowed before inspection.

Shanghai-Dinghai Passengers Limited to Merchants

Although the resumption of the Shanghai-Dinghai line once encountered problems due to the authorities' strict prohibition of passengers, it was then facilitated by the shipping industry, and proper merchants with proper guarantees were allowed to board the vessel. The German merchant Hana returned from Dinghai to Shanghai on the 14th, and the passengers on board were also limited to proper merchants. It will continue to sail on the 15th.
