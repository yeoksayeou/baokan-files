Chongqing – According to Chinese sources here, the Japanese army on the Guangxi border has continued to advance towards Nanning, hoping to cut off the highway traffic between China and Vietnam.

In these three days, the Japanese planes bombed the suburbs of Nanning from morning to night, without ceasing. Sometimes, as many as a dozen or so planes were used, and there were no fewer than eight or nine bombing raids each day. At the same time, because the air raid alarms have not stopped, it has been impossible to investigate the actual number of casualties. It is reported that the Chinese side has ordered all highways southeast of Nanning (including those from Nanning to the Annam border) to be destroyed as soon as possible.

Commentary

### The United States, the Soviet Union, and the Far East

The restoration of order and the establishment of peace in the Far East depend on China and Japan; and the most helpful parties are the United States and the Soviet Union. The order and peace of the Far East were not in question, the problem lies in Japan's aggression; China resists the aggression, while the US and the Soviet Union have the power to encourage or curb the aggression.

The attitude of the United States is very clear, but its actions have been indecisive. Although it hates aggression, it has supplied Japan with a large amount of materials in the past two years, which in fact has encouraged the aggressor. In the most recent half-year, public opinion has gradually matured, and its attitude has changed from clear to firm. Without discussing other points, Deputy Secretary of State Welles has clearly expressed his views three times in the past week: (1) On the 17th of this month, he gave a speech to the press, denouncing the Japanese side's claim that the US government was preparing to recognize the new situation in China. (2) On the 21st, based on the Tianjin phenomenon, he clarified the US government's consistent policy of announcing the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. (3) On the 22nd, he refuted the Japanese dissemination of the atmosphere that the US and Japan had begun negotiations on a new treaty, stating that not only had negotiations not taken place in Washington and Tokyo, but also that the treaty would expire on January 26 next year and would not be renewed. In addition, the US preparations for various actions against Japan after January next year are also something that the US government and people are focusing on. The attitude of the United States is enough to clarify the international concept of right and wrong and make the aggressor realize the idea of deceiving the world. It will definitely help curb aggression and help the Far East restore order and establish peace.

As for the Soviet Union, it has provided substantial assistance to China for two and a half years; however, due to the reflection of other international issues, even when people discuss international affairs and involve the Soviet Union, they often say that the Soviet Union's ideas and actions are the least predictable. This allows aggressive countries to continue their delusions, hoping that the Soviet Union will be threatened and induced to tolerate aggression, or even help them do evil.

Is it really because our judgment and knowledge are insufficient to say that the Soviet Union is the most unpredictable? Or is it because the Soviet Union's policy is too profound to be measured? Reviewing the past three months, who has ever foreseen what the Soviet Union has shown internationally? Who can predict the direction of what the Soviet Union will launch internationally from now on? Therefore, it is not wrong to say that it is unpredictable. Should a country's international policy be open and transparent, shared with the world, like the United States, or should it be mysterious and unpredictable, like the Soviet Union? Each has its own merits and demerits, and it is not appropriate to generalize. If the Soviet Union has ambitions for Poland and succeeds after the German offensive, this is indeed a harvest of unpredictable ideas and actions. If the Soviet Union had not issued a declaration of "striving to liberate the Belarusians and Ukrainians from the shackles of the Polish gentry," exposing the plot to communize the Belarusians and Ukrainians several years ago, would Poland not be a vassal of the German-Italian axis? Would it not be shouting for the Anti-Comintern Pact? In which direction would the German offensive have taken? What form would the European situation have taken? Although these are questions that will never be answered, there are countless similar questions; however, there is no doubt that the Soviet Union would not have been able to expand its territory by 200,000 square kilometers at the cost of 2.6 million Red Army casualties. Therefore, the unpredictability of Soviet policy is for the Soviet Union's plan to deal with Europe, and it can be said that it is adapting to the times and circumstances. The Far East is very different from Europe. The nature of the problem is different, the complexity of the content is different, and the impact on the future is also different. Moreover, given the Soviet Union's substantial assistance to China, it is not appropriate to regard the Soviet Union's policy towards the Far East as unpredictable. There are several reasons for this, which can be obstacles to seeing and hearing, and can be psychological demons, thus becoming a black shadow on the vision and psychology of the Far East problem. One reason is that the Soviet Union has taken from Poland, which gives people the impression of a fit of territorial ambition; the second is that the Soviet Union favors Germany and is dissatisfied with the United States, which inspires people to manipulate them; the third is that when the Soviet Union attacks capitalist countries, its language infringes on the United States, which shows people that there are gaps between the United States and the Soviet Union that can be followed; the fourth is that the signing of the truce agreement between Manchuria and Mongolia and the Soviet-Japanese proposal for a treaty make people suspect that all compromises are possible; the fifth is that the Soviet Union's actions in the past three months have made people believe that it is about to launch a major offensive in Europe, so it is plotting to blackmail the Far East. All of these things, although the Soviet Union's assistance to China is substantial, the black shadow it has given to the Far East in terms of vision and psychology has become stronger and more active recently. Where the black shadow lies, the aggressor's delusions follow; believing that those who cannot be tolerated by the United States may gain something from the Soviet Union; not believing in the Soviet Union, or using the Soviet Union to seek tolerance from the United States.

We really do not know in the Soviet Union's eyes, which country in the world is more frank and sincere to China, and more willing to be friendly with the Soviet Union? Which country is more historically able to live in peace and harmony with the Soviet Union? The fact that the Soviet Union has assisted China cannot be denied, but in terms of the black shadow formed recently, it also has the consequence of objectively encouraging aggression; how can the Soviet authorities, upholding their sympathy for China over the past few years, use words and deeds to make the aggressor realize something, so that the situation in the Far East can be clarified as soon as possible?

### US Authorities Reiterate No Negotiations with Japan on Commerce Treaty, Focus of US-Japan Relations is Situation in Far East, British Newspaper Does Not Believe US Ambassador is Mediating the War

Washington – US Deputy Secretary of State Welles today warned Japan that the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which the US government has announced it will abolish, will expire on January 26 next year and will not be renewed, denying that new treaty negotiations are being held in Tokyo or Washington, and stating that US relations with Japan depend on the development of the situation in the Far East and its impact on US interests. Welles said, "The US Ambassador to Japan has often discussed relations between the US and Japan and various issues of mutual concern with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years, but new treaty negotiations have not been held in Tokyo or Washington recently, and the US government has not issued any special instructions to Ambassador Grew. The US government has repeatedly and clearly stated that these events are all related to the development of the situation, and the government will pay attention to every development and every fact that affects relations between the two countries, and carefully study all aspects of various issues." It is reported that Welles' statement is the second important declaration on US-Japan relations in a week and seems to have two meanings because its publication time is within 24 hours after Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horiuchi Kensuke announced Japan's "readiness" to negotiate a new treaty with the United States. Observers here are very interested in the propaganda of Japanese newspapers. Japanese newspapers recently reported that Japanese special envoy to China Kato will hold talks with the US Consul General in Shanghai, which are of the same nature as those held by Grew and Nomura in Tokyo, but in fact, not only have the Shanghai talks not been held, but even the date of the Grew-Nomura talks has not been determined. Officials here also commented on the Japanese claim that Kato met with US Ambassador to China Johnson in Shanghai for an hour and a half. Officials here claimed that Kato's visit to Johnson lasted only 20 minutes. In addition, Welles' statement is also an implicit indication of intensifying the movement to pass the Pittman bill on banning the export of military supplies to Japan when the US Congress convenes a regular meeting in China in January next year. Commerce experts here said that even if the US Congress does not pass the bill on banning the export of military supplies, the State Department can actually achieve the effect of a ban. After the abolition of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the government will have the freedom to adjust import and export taxes on Japan, which will greatly reduce or eliminate Japanese trade. The government had a precedent for Germany in the past two years, and the sharp increase in tariffs on German trade had brought US-German relations to a standstill before the outbreak of the European war. The US can implement the same policy towards Japan. (Associated Press, 22nd)

Washington – At a time when the issue of a new treaty between the US and Japan is being discussed, the Department of Commerce recently released a report pointing out the impact of the European war on Japan's economic situation and proving that Japan's reliance on the United States for various raw materials and machines needed to continue the war against China or to maintain export volume is increasing. A concise excerpt from the report reads, "Since the outbreak of the European war, Japan's supply of various major raw materials needed for industry has been severely hampered, and those from the British Empire are particularly affected. 20% of the raw materials needed by Japan come from the British Empire. The tin needed for canned food comes from the Malay Archipelago. The raw materials needed for the rubber industry come from the Straits Settlements. Other raw materials such as wool produced in the Commonwealth of Australia and nickel and lead produced in Canada are banned from being shipped to Japan because they are exclusively for use by the UK. As for machinery and chemicals, which used to be supplied by Germany, the source has now been cut off. All of these factors have made it impossible for Japan's industry to develop, so it is impossible to expand sales to Latin America. In addition, Japan's financial situation is not good, and US industries require cash on delivery, which is the difficulty Japan faces when purchasing goods from the US." (Havas News Agency, 22nd) The Times of London diplomatic correspondent claimed today that people in general with good news sources were very skeptical about the news spread by the Japanese side that US Ambassador to China Johnson planned to propose that the US mediate the Sino-Japanese war. The US government is now dealing with treaty rights threatened by Japanese military action in a tough way, and it seems that it will never help the Japanese army out of its predicament in China. As for the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, both sides may temporarily stop the dispute due to their respective difficulties, but this truce agreement does not include a general compromise between the Soviet Union and Japan, but sacrifices the political interests of China and the Soviet Union in China. (Reuters, 22nd)

London – Chinese Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi met with a Reuters reporter today and expressed doubt about the Japanese claim that US Ambassador to China Johnson planned to propose that the US mediate the Sino-Japanese war. It is said that the purpose of such news is only to confuse world public opinion. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Japanese Shionomi Seisaku Issues Statement in Guilin, Expressing Gratitude for Chinese Generosity

Guilin – The campaign headquarters spokesman introduced Japanese Shionomi Seisaku when he received reporters this morning. Japanese anti-war writer Kashiji Wataru was also invited to attend. The spokesman said that Shionomi was from Nara Prefecture, Japan, and is 26 years old. He graduated from the French Department of Osaka Foreign Language School. He first served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was transferred to the position of secretary at the Consulate General in Hanoi in 1936. He was arrested at Zhennanguan on December 29 last year. At that time, Japanese newspapers fabricated all kinds of rumors, either saying that Shionomi was arrested in Annam by dozens of our troops, or saying that he was subjected to various abuses after being arrested, or even saying that he was executed by us for espionage. Now, however, Shionomi is still alive and well, and all the true circumstances can be explained by himself. The spokesman continued that Shionomi has now become our friend and an enemy of the Japanese warlords. He is moving towards the path of anti-war struggle for the Japanese people. Based on this fact, it is believed that there are two points that need to be explained: first, the target of our country's war of resistance is the Japanese warlords. The constant friendship between our people and the Japanese people is maintained, and there is no hatred at all. Second, the Japanese warlords harbor the dream of omnipotence with force, and do not hesitate to fight us with huge manpower and financial resources, which is contrary to the will of the general people in the country. We believe that most of the Japanese people have the same aspirations as Shionomi. At present, anti-war organizations among the Japanese people in the Communist country are growing day by day. Once the opportunity comes, they will surely rise up and overthrow the warlords and realize the true peace of East Asia and truly join hands with the Chinese people, and the time is not far away. Therefore, the introduction of Shionomi today is of great significance. Shionomi then stood up and, with a cheerful expression and excited tone, recited a statement as long as a thousand words, expressing sincere gratitude for the Chinese generosity. The statement described the reasons for his change of heart and his resolute participation in the revolutionary work of the Japanese people, pointing out the crisis of the current Japanese government and the contradictions of all the measures of the warlords. One section refuted the false propaganda of the Japanese side, admitting that his arrest was caused by mistakenly entering Chinese territory from the Liangshan area of ​​Annam. Another section announced his future aspirations to build a "peaceful Japan for the Japanese people." The statement also included a report on the Japanese warlords' ambition to advance south, saying, "To the best of my knowledge, the Japanese warlords are even preparing and exerting their strength to invade areas such as Annam, the Philippines, Siam, and the Dutch East Indies." After reading his statement, Shionomi made a concluding remark, saying, "As a prisoner of war under international law, I am treated as an international friend. I am sincerely grateful, and words cannot describe it." Then he showed a draft of his resignation, the translation of which is as follows: Respectfully submitted, since the end of last year, I have received the protection of the Chinese government in China. As stated in the statement I have issued, in order to build a genuine new order in East Asia, I have decided to sever relations with the Japanese government, which is a puppet of the military aggressors. I hereby submit my resignation. Please investigate. This presentation is made to Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Kichisaburo and Shionomi Seisaku, an official at the Japanese Consulate General in Hanoi, Annam. (23rd)

### Remnants of the Battle Around Sui and Zao

Da Hong Shan – A reporter recently traveled along the route of the Japanese army's retreat during the Battle of Sui and Zao to reach this area. What was seen along the way was that most houses had been reduced to ruins. Even though several months had passed, the devastation was still evident. The organization of the populace is steadily improving, with the strengthening of the Baojia system, training of young men, and thorough implementation of fortified villages and clearing the fields. The production in the mountains is very rich. In addition to storing rice, the local authorities also export cotton, with a substantial yield. Recently, many residents have been spinning and weaving on their own. Along the route between Zao (Yang) and Huan (Tan), vendors transporting local cloth and yarn are constantly seen. Education in the mountains has not been interrupted either, and there is even a middle school. At sunrise and sunset, the sound of gunfire practice is mixed with magnificent anti-Japanese war songs, echoing through the valleys. Life here is safe, and prices are low. Being here makes one feel that the future of the war of resistance has unlimited brightness. Today, the reporter visited a certain army commander who has been steadfastly defending Da Hong Shan and repeatedly thwarting the Japanese offensives. He spoke freely about the operational process of his unit during the Battle of Sui and Zao and the current war situation. According to him, after the Japanese Ito and Etsuji divisions went north, his unit suddenly cut off the Japanese supply line in the Zhangjiaji area for as long as five days, causing the deeply entrenched Japanese army to run out of supplies and suffer a defeat. At that time, although the Japanese tried hard to break through, our officers and soldiers were determined to fight to the death for victory, firmly defending the key points, and never wavering in the face of Japanese threats. Someone at Tongzichong killed hundreds of Japanese soldiers, frightening the Japanese. Later, they pointed their division north and ambushed the southward-moving Japanese army in the northern part of Da Hong Shan. After five days and nights of hard fighting, they also inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army, seizing a large number of spoils of war. The corpses of the defeated Japanese were scattered everywhere, and they fled south in a panic, building fortifications to defend themselves. For several months, they have not dared to cross the Lei Pond even one step. This month, the Chinese army launched an offensive, and the Japanese army launched a counterattack for a time, engaging in fierce battles in the area of Daxiao Duoshan west of Maping and southeast of Suixian. After repeated assaults by the Chinese army, the Japanese army was still wounded and retreated. Now they are facing off with the Chinese army at Dushan west of Maping. Finally, the army commander told the reporter with a firm attitude that the officers and soldiers in the mountains are all determined to sacrifice themselves, their morale is extremely high, and they have close cooperation with the people. The Japanese army's combat effectiveness is weakening day by day, and their desire to be home sick is growing stronger day by day. Comparing the two, it is believed that the final victory must not be far away. (23rd dispatch)

### Weekly War Situation: 15th to 21st

Chongqing – A spokesman for the Military Commission stated that from November 15th to 21st, the Japanese army on various fronts had repeatedly engaged in provocative actions, with the most intense fighting taking place on the southern route in Guangdong Province. Since the Japanese army suffered heavy losses in the northern part of Hunan and Jiangxi last month, in order to cover up their military failures, they launched a landing offensive in the Qinzhou-Lianzhou area. Fierce battles are currently underway. The more important aspects of the fighting are described below:

Guangdong Province: Dozens of Japanese warships gathered in the sea off the Qinzhou-Lianzhou area on the southern route.

On the 14th, our army raided Jianzhen, west of Jiangxian, killing three Japanese officers and many soldiers, and burning down many ammunition depots and barracks.

### British Secretary of War Reports Frontline Military Situation in the House of Commons; Long-Term Strategy Already Decided; Final Victory Within Reach

London – Secretary of War Hore-Belisha spoke in the House of Commons today, recounting the Polish war, which allowed the Allied forces on the Western Front to make arrangements in an unhurried manner. He said that Britain's cause was just, which enabled British nationals around the world to return to their country to join the army. Every week, thousands of British soldiers are sent to France, and the number will be even greater in the spring. Without the help of the British Home Guard, it would not be possible to complete the organization of the troops in France. The Home Guard's departure for France was earlier and more numerous than in 1914. Currently, one million people are receiving rigorous training in Britain. Although France was in financial straits, it still spent money and resources to create the Maginot Line. This kind of preparation is something that all free countries should be grateful for. Germany must defend a 200-mile border, while France must anticipate the possibility of Germany invading France along an 800-mile border from the North Sea to the Alps. The defensive positions currently held by the British army have been established in advance, so the British army's task is to strengthen and improve these defensive positions. All the areas where fighting is taking place are muddy. An unimaginably large-scale organization has now been established. In the early stages of the war, the British Expeditionary Force consumed 500 tons of gasoline per day. Vehicles must continue to be transported, and roads must be built. There is still a vehicle problem today, and even more will be needed in the future. The Secretary of War went on to say that the British army on the Western Front receives 270,000 letters and 17,000 parcels every day, twice as many as in 1918, and the British army has personnel to manage them with ease, which shows how large and complete the British army's various organizations are. He had just returned from observing the front, so he was able to report that the British army's discipline was good, its actions were lively, and it was exciting to see. The British army's sanitation is excellent, and the disease rate is lower than usual in the country. The British army now has all kinds of facilities for health. In addition to conscripting soldiers of all ranks, Britain has also recruited more than 85,000 volunteers. Soldiers in domestic divisions who can go to the front will be transferred out one after another when the Home Guard is established. This is a long-term war. The British people have always been known for their patience, so they can become stronger day by day. The prolongation of time does not affect Britain, but the enemy's economy cannot withstand it. If the enemy wants to win, they must break through the Allied line of defense. However, the Allies are now waiting for the enemy's fierce attack with confidence of victory, and the Allies can take advantage of the opportunity to move. The Allies have no divergent opinions and no inconsistent demands. Their strategy has been decided long ago, and the outcome is certain. The Secretary of War spoke about the success of Britain's management of contraband, saying that 14,000 tons of goods suspected of being transported to Germany have been intercepted. In the eleven weeks since the start of the war, a total of 441,000 tons of contraband have been seized. (22nd Reuters dispatch)

### British Warships in the North Sea Release Smoke Screens; British King Issues Edict to Parliament

London – Parliament reconvened yesterday afternoon, and King George VI issued an edict, stating: "There is another war in Europe. Although My government has tried its best to maintain peace, Germany has finally violated its solemn commitments and invaded Poland for no reason. This is another act of aggression by that country and another act of bad faith. If My country does not want to lose its reputation and allow the freedom and progress of mankind to be endangered, it must respond to this provocative act. This is not to seek material gain, but to carry on the tradition of protecting freedom, rights, and free institutions. Now, Members of the House of Commons, all of you can accept the heavy financial burden and raise the necessary military expenditure. I am very grateful that the people are willing to make any sacrifice in order to achieve the final victory. This has also aroused deep impressions around the world. I am particularly excited that My subjects at home and abroad have been able to work together and participate in the war after the outbreak of war, and that the autonomous territories have also automatically joined the war and made extremely valuable contributions. I am also deeply convinced that the two allied countries, France and Poland, can cooperate faithfully with Us, and that the goals of the war can be achieved without doubt. May God bless your work."

However, in some locations designated as forced evacuation zones, people are still not allowed to return. (23rd United Press dispatch)

### Britain Must Not Forget the Crisis in the Far East

London – Dr. Hsia Ching-lin, professor of international relations at Shanghai Jiaotong University and government official, gave a speech here last night, stating the danger of Britain focusing on the European situation and forgetting its interests in the Far East. He said that events in the Far East have a very important reaction in the West. He firmly believes that a new China will emerge from the destruction of the war, and the rebirth of the new China will be one of the greatest events in history. Europe seems to be facing political bankruptcy. Today's international society seems to be based on absurd theories. In his opinion, the world will still seek leadership from the new evolution of civilization in the Far East. (23rd Reuters dispatch)

### British House of Commons Questions Negotiations with Japan

London – At a meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Liberal MP Mander asked about the Shanghai issue. Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Butler replied that the situation in the Shanghai International Settlement itself has not changed. The Hongkou area has not been returned to the management of the Municipal Council. As for the area outside the Shanghai Western District Settlement, the Shanghai Municipal Government, supported by the Japanese side, has disagreed with the Municipal Council on the issue of police powers on roads built beyond the settlement, causing considerable unease. The two sides are still negotiating in the hope of reaching a temporary solution. Mander then asked, "Under what circumstances does Japan allow British ships to anchor and unload cargo in various ports along the Chinese coast, especially in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai? The British shipping industry has previously complained about various delays and obstacles. Will this situation improve?" Undersecretary Butler then replied, "The facilities granted to third-country ships at Qingdao Wharf are still insufficient. In Yantai, pressure has been exerted on Chinese merchants not to ship their goods on British ships. However, according to reliable private sources, this situation has improved slightly. In Tianjin, British ships have been delayed due to the impact of the Japanese military's blockade and inspection. As for the ports in South China, Fuzhou has been blockaded by the Japanese military with underwater mines. As for Guangzhou and Shantou, which are occupied by the Japanese military, temporary measures have been established with the Japanese military authorities to allow British ships to operate on schedule."

### British Destroyer *Ipswich* Struck by Mine, Exploded: 21 Crew Injured, 40 Missing; Several Ships Sunk by Mines in British Waters

London: The mines that destroyed the Dutch liner *Simon Bolivar* and the Japanese liner *Terukuni Maru*, among over a dozen other merchant ships off the east coast of England, yesterday endangered British warships. The British 1,335-ton destroyer *Ipswich* became the first warship to strike a mine in that area. Fortunately, the captain was alert and quickly ran the ship aground, preventing it from being completely destroyed. Twenty-one crew members were injured, and forty are missing. Last night, over a hundred crew members disembarked at a port on the east coast on various vessels. One sailor told people that he was in the engine room when the explosion occurred and found himself in the water, not knowing how he got there. He had a minor forehead injury and was rescued by swimming. Nearby ships immediately rushed to rescue after hearing the explosion. Hundreds of onlookers on the shore watched the rescue operation under searchlights. The rescued were in high spirits and not discouraged, singing loudly as they came ashore, appearing quite excited. Because it was night, the rescued were dressed in various attire, some wearing bathrobes and others wearing sleeping clothes. It is said that the ship's hull was broken in two. It is noted that this ship rescued three pilots floating on the water in a rubber dinghy this morning and rescued ten shipwrecked crew members in the North Sea a few days ago. This ship joined the fleet in Devonport in 1936 and was equipped with four 4.7-inch guns. (Reuters, 23rd)

London: The British cargo ship *Gerardus* sank in the eastern sea after leaving Hull. All twenty-six crew members have been rescued. (Havas, 23rd)

London: The Greek ship *Irina* (4,576 tons), carrying a batch of grain from La Palada, Argentina, to Antwerp, Belgium, sank in the southern British waters yesterday evening, possibly after hitting a mine. All twenty-three crew members escaped, with only three suffering minor injuries and being sent to the hospital for treatment. (Havas, 23rd)

London: A French fishing boat recently struck a mine in the southeastern British waters, and its nine sailors are still missing. People here are generally very worried about them. (Havas, 23rd)

Helsinki: The Finnish cargo ship *Minerva*, carrying a batch of timber to The Hague, Netherlands, was recently intercepted by a German warship in the Baltic Sea and ordered to sail to a port in that country, where it was detained. There are as many as ten Finnish cargo ships detained by Germany, most of which were detained while sailing to neutral countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States. (Havas, 23rd)

Stockholm: The *Social Democratic Newspaper* here recently reported that the mines laid by Germany on the east coast of England are apparently magnetic mines originally invented by the Swedish man Bestron in 1908. The manufacturing rights have been sold to many countries, including Germany and Sweden. Bestron told reporters yesterday, "The mines used by Germany are mostly made according to the principles I invented. They sink into the deep sea, and when a ship passes, they are attracted to the surface by magnetism and explode." (Havas, 23rd)

### Two German Submarines Sunk by France

Paris: The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 160, stating, "The air forces of both sides were quite active in various locations on the front line today. In addition, our destroyers have continuously sunk two German submarines in the past three days." (Havas, 23rd)

### Handling the Aftermath of the *Terukuni Maru* Disaster: Shigemitsu and Captain Discuss Countermeasures

London: Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Shigemitsu Aoi, summoned Naval Attaché Colonel Kondo, Lieutenant Commander Minamoto, and *Terukuni Maru* Captain Matsukura Bunjiro to the embassy on the morning of the 22nd to hear about the circumstances and causes of the sinking of the *Terukuni Maru* and to discuss the Japanese response. Colonel Kondo then visited the British Admiralty with Captain Matsukura for discussions. (Domei, 22nd)

London: Matsukura, captain of the Japanese regular liner *Terukuni Maru*, weighing 11,930 tons, said about the disaster two days ago that the *Terukuni Maru* was definitely not sunk by a drifting mine. The ship was traveling at 15 knots on the southwest course of a sunken lightship when it struck the mine. The draft was 27 feet. It was daytime and the visibility was good. There were five lookouts on duty. The explosion was not on the side of the ship but under the bottom, causing the ship to jump up and everyone on board to be thrown into the air. The nearest British minefield was 35 miles away, and British mines, if they broke free and drifted, would automatically lose their effectiveness and would not harm shipping. Because it was daytime and the sea was calm, no one on the *Terukuni Maru* lost their lives. The ship did not list, and the lifeboats were lowered in time. Most of the passengers and crew were rescued by nearby ships. Before the *Terukuni Maru* encountered the accident, it was in the British contraband control port for less than five hours before it received its departure permit. Furthermore, according to British shipping industry sources, Germany is deliberately laying mines on the shipping lanes, with the obvious intention of causing losses and threats to commercial shipping, regardless of neutrality or humanity. Japanese and other neutral shipping companies are extremely indignant about this German action. (Reuters, 23rd)

Tokyo: After the Japanese liner *Terukuni Maru* struck a mine and sank, the newspapers here are paying close attention and are requesting the government to issue notes to the belligerent countries, asking them to take measures to protect neutrality, while also acknowledging that this is an unavoidable fact. In the China Incident, the innocent threat to the rights and interests of third countries has been seen many times. (Haitong, 23rd)

### Romanian Cabinet Resigns

Bucharest: Prime Minister Armand Călinescu recently submitted the resignation of the entire cabinet to King Carol II. The King has scheduled a Privy Council meeting at 4 PM to discuss the formation of a new cabinet. All members of the Privy Council and the resigning cabinet members will attend.

### German-Romanian Trade Negotiations: German Delegation Returns Home, Agreement Reportedly Signed

The German signatory was the German Minister of Food Supply, who hurriedly returned to Berlin yesterday. He, on the other hand, will remain here to negotiate a new trade agreement with the Romanian government so that Germany can develop resources and enjoy other special commercial rights in Romania. At the same time, Romanian Minister of Economy Popoiu also submitted his resignation yesterday, but officials denied that Popoiu's resignation was due to Germany's request for a large supply of kerosene. (United Press, 23rd)

Bucharest: The German economic delegation left Bucharest for Germany yesterday. The leader of the delegation was Clodius. It is said that the delegation signed an agreement with Romania, in which Romania promised to increase the amount of kerosene sold to Germany. (Haitong, 23rd)

Bucharest: After the resignation of Romanian Minister of Economy Bujoiu, his vacancy has been concurrently filled by Prime Minister Armand Călinescu himself. Bujoiu's resignation came after the end of negotiations with the German trade delegation. It is said that Bujoiu deeply felt that some German trade methods and demands could not be integrated with Romania's current overseas trade system. He requested the government to adopt a new export and import system, but the government did not adopt it, so Bujoiu requested resignation. The German delegation, except for its leader, has now returned home. It is said that this visit yielded very little. At the same time, the trade negotiations between Romania and Yugoslavia have resulted in an agreement for Yugoslavia to exchange 30,000 tons of copper for Romania's oil production. (Reuters, 23rd)

### British Bombers Shipped to Romania

Amsterdam: A message from London says that 36 bombers will be shipped to Romania recently. It is reported that these aircraft were flown to London by Romanian pilots themselves. (Haitong, 23rd)

London: According to the British Air Ministry today, Britain has already handed over 36 bombers to Romania. A month ago, Romania sent an air force officer and twelve pilots here to fly away the first batch of bombers. At the end of October, another batch of pilots came here to fly away the second batch of aircraft. Ten days later, this batch of pilots came again to fly away the last batch of aircraft. It is said that three squadrons of the Romanian Air Force are composed of British Blenheim aircraft. (United Press, 23rd)

### Danish Trade Delegation to UK for Negotiations

Copenhagen: A Danish trade delegation of 21 people, led by Prince Axel, cousin of King Christian X, departed from here by plane yesterday morning for London to negotiate the British price policy and the commercial relations between Britain and Denmark. (Haitong, 23rd)

Copenhagen: According to statistics released by the government here, Denmark's import surplus in October was 16,000,000 kroner. Total imports were 143,900,000 kroner, an increase of 19,600,000 kroner compared to 124,300,000 kroner in September. Total exports were 28,000,000 kroner. (Haitong, 23rd)

### UK and Italy Swap Goods in Trade Agreement

London: According to the financial news political correspondent yesterday, a barter trade between Britain and Italy can come to an end. Italy has agreed in principle to give Britain its remaining hemp (worth about £2 million), and Britain will compensate with Indian jute. Italy will then exchange tires for British rubber and cotton. Great progress has also been made in discussions on Italy's need for coal. Italy needs 8 million tons of coal in the next twelve months, and Italy will exchange machinery for it. (United Press, 23rd)

### Belgium and Netherlands Discuss UK Blockade Policy: Netherlands Declares Reservation of All Rights

Amsterdam: The Dutch official office issued a statement to Reuters today, explaining the Dutch government's attitude towards the British contraband control measures, stating that if the Netherlands can no longer supply Germany with the same amount of food and raw materials as before, then according to its neutral policy, it will have to restrict the supply of the same goods to Britain. It is unacceptable for belligerent countries to force neutral countries to declare that goods transported on their own ships cannot be transferred to other places in any form. Regardless of whether this is in line with the Dutch neutral policy, the consequences of acquiescing to this pressure must be considered. As a result of this pressure, the Netherlands will only be able to import goods for Dutch consumption and will not be able to trade with belligerent countries, especially Germany, which is the Netherlands' largest customer. British policy not only destroys the Dutch concept of neutrality but also destroys the basic concept of international law, and it will have the most unfavorable repercussions for Britain's own trade. (Reuters, 23rd)

Amsterdam: The Belgian Minister of Economy arrived in The Hague yesterday and held a long discussion with Dutch Minister of Economy Dr. Steiber to discuss the situation of the Central Kingdom tightening its blockade policy and implementing retaliatory measures against Germany. Officials expect that the Netherlands will recall the Dutch economic delegation currently in London and suspend economic negotiations to protest Britain's plan to obstruct neutral countries' commerce. Dutch newspapers report that the Netherlands will not recognize Britain's new plan because this plan violates international law. (Haitong, 23rd)

Berlin: A Haitong reporter inquired with German officials last night about the British claim that Germany's strategy in naval warfare violated international law. It was said that since the beginning of the war, Britain has repeatedly abandoned international conventions and has also used international law for various propaganda purposes. Britain wants to give the world a bad impression of Germany, believing that Germany's war strategy is illegal. In fact, the purpose of German naval warfare is only to destroy enemy warships and ships used for combat, while the methods adopted by Britain have become even more extreme, such as "mine warfare." The Hague Convention of 1907 stipulated that after laying mines, a notice should be issued. Germany has notified the world of the areas where mines are densely laid. Britain should not cite the Hague Convention to prohibit the placement of mines outside enemy ports and along the coast to criticize. (Haitong, 23rd)

London: According to the Ministry of Economy, German-controlled commercial firms in neutral countries are now attempting to smuggle American goods into Germany by using neutral transportation companies. In September, American exports to Germany decreased by $12 million compared to September of last year, while American exports to Sweden, the Netherlands, and Norway increased by $11 million. The difference between the two numbers is almost negligible, and it is not a coincidence. The details of how Britain controls German exports are still confidential when it is established, but this control will not amount to a blockade but will only tighten contraband controls, aimed at preventing Germany from obtaining foreign exchange. (Reuters, 23rd)

London: Regarding Britain's decision to blockade German trade, well-informed sources here recently said that Dutch Minister to the UK Stirum has issued a note to the Foreign Office, declaring the reservation of all rights. This note is not a formal protest document but only explains that the Dutch government, in view of the losses suffered in the future, has to raise some objections. On the other hand, the Belgian government usually waits until the British government announces the implementation of the blockade before initiating negotiations. Diplomatic circles here recently commented on the note submitted by the Dutch government, saying that this was expected. It would not be surprising even if the government formally protested. The British government will do everything possible to reduce the inconvenience to various countries, but it cannot change the original plan because only by blockading German export trade can it respond to the piracy methods adopted by that country. (Havas, 13th)

### French Government Establishes Procurement Committee

Paris: The joint meeting of the highest national defense committees of Britain and France has decided to adjust the efforts of both sides in order to conduct an economic war. The French government issued an order on the 22nd of this month in accordance with this decision, establishing a Procurement Committee, chaired by Prime Minister Daladier, and including Finance Minister Reynaud, Minister of Agriculture and Supply Queuille, Minister of Public Works and Transportation Thellier, Minister of Aviation Laurent-Eynac, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, Minister of Commerce Gentin, Minister of Armaments Thautte, Minister of Merchant Marine Tival, and Minister of Blockade Pernot as members, and appointing a secretary general to carry out the committee's affairs. (Havas, 23rd)

### German Political Police Uncover the Inside Story of a British Spy Network: German Police Contacted British Intelligence Department; The Story is Bizarre, Like a Detective Novel

Berlin: The details of the German secret police's maintaining wireless communication with the British intelligence department were released here last night. It is reported that British intelligence personnel, claiming to be the German opposition, handed a wireless radio to the leader of the Stormtroopers. The German secret police then used Captain Stevens' code to maintain contact with the British government and the British intelligence department for as long as 21 days. This wireless message was exchanged with the British side in the name of the so-called German Revolutionary Party. Its future publication will prove the tragic psychology of the current British ruling class. The German secret police ended this contact at 10 PM on the 22nd of this month, sending a telegram stating, "Talking to arrogant and stupid people will inevitably make you feel tired. We will no longer talk. Greetings from the German opposition, German secret police sincerely." (Haitong, 23rd)

Berlin: German newspapers yesterday published photos of the wireless radio handed over to the German secret police by British intelligence personnel. This wireless transmitter is installed in a small black wooden box, similar to an ordinary transmitter. After connecting the power and antenna, it can transmit messages. Because it is small in size and weighs only 12 kilograms, it is very convenient to carry. Judging from the structure of the machine, it can be manufactured in large quantities, and there must be many other places that use this transmitter. (Haitong, 23rd)

Berlin: Official sources here have released a letter from Strasser detailing a plan to prevent the Saar region from returning to Germany. The names mentioned in the letter are marked with numbers. The letter was issued on June 22, 1934, and stated, "I arrived in Paris on June 18 and immediately met with No. 1. I then contacted No. 2 and was received by his private secretary, and then discussed with Nos. 3 and 4. The results of the meeting were that France strictly abides by the treaty and does not want to conduct a 'trial' in the Saar region: (1) France is unwilling to take responsibility; (2) There will be major changes in Germany before the vote; (3) If there is a larger minority, the League of Nations will make a decision unfavorable to Germany. For the above reasons, a larger minority must be obtained through propaganda. I also discussed with No. 5 and No. 6. No. 6 and No. 2 and No. 4 all advocated using propaganda." The numbers and names are as follows: No. 1, former Prussian Minister of the Interior Grzesinski; No. 2, Camille of the French Foreign Ministry; No. 3, Le Caulet; No. 4, Hacquet; No. 5, Dalloil; No. 6, Grumberg; No. 7, Spaquel; No. 8, Communist Muenzenberg.

Berlin: After two British intelligence personnel were arrested, officials here have not released any information, but it is generally believed that a report on the German secret police's maintaining contact with the British intelligence department will be released recently. The *People's Observer* reported that after the German secret police managed to maintain contact with the British intelligence department and interrogated the captured British intelligence personnel, they have now obtained important information. They found out that Best and Stevens were both responsible for important missions of the British intelligence department. The British government attempted to use The Hague as the wartime headquarters of the intelligence department and as a base for assassinations and other crimes. (Haitong, 23rd)

Berlin: The *Essen City National Daily* recently published details of the arrest of Georg Elser, the perpetrator of the Munich bombing. It is reported that "Since the Munich bombing, German border guards have paid close attention to the people coming and going. The search at the border between Germany and Switzerland is particularly strict. On the night of the 8th, customs officer Li Gan and his assistant Zippler were walking through the *Weissenburg Garden* near Constance when they caught a glimpse of a figure climbing over the bamboo fence of the garden, attempting to escape from German territory. Li Gan immediately chased after and apprehended him. The person claimed that he was planning to visit a friend named Focher-Herber and produced a border crossing passport, but the passport had expired in 1932. Li Gan lured the person to his friend's place, saying that he could definitely find out the whereabouts of Focher-Herber. The person refused, so Li Gan forcibly led him into the customs office and found various documents on his person. He was then taken to the police station. Under interrogation, it was learned that his name was Georg Elser. (Haitong, 23rd)

Paris: Otto Strasser, leader of the anti-National Socialist Black Front, who was pointed out by the German secret police as the mastermind behind the Munich bombing, recently told a reporter from *Paris Evening News* that he did not know Elser and that he was not a member of the Black Front. He had never heard of Best or Captain Stephens. It is noted that Elser is a worker. According to the German secret police, Elser has confessed to the attempted murder of Hitler. Best is the director of the British intelligence agency in Western Europe, and Stevens is an accomplice. (Reuters, 23rd)

London: Regarding the circumstances of the arrest of the perpetrators of the bombing in Munich, Germany, the head of the National Political Police, Himmler, has submitted a report after arresting the so-called perpetrator Elser and the British spies Best and Stevens, strongly stating that the case was planned by the British spy agency. The general public here views this as a "detective novel" and is treating it with equanimity, but believes it is worthy of discussion. Military figures say that after studying this report, it will be known that it is completely inaccurate. According to Himmler, the National Political Police discovered and thwarted this conspiracy after arresting two British spies in Venlo, a town on the border of the Netherlands (near Germany). According to this, the German National Political Police already knew about the British spy agency's plot to harm Hitler in the capital of the Netherlands beforehand, but allowed the perpetrator Elser to lay bombs. Would they rather this conspiracy become a fait accompli? Or do they know that the situation is simpler? Best and Stevens have nothing to do with the British spy agency. Their place of arrest was not in Germany but in the Netherlands, or at least they must have been framed. (Havas, 23rd)

### As Japanese Troops are Deployed Elsewhere, Chinese Troops Burn Japanese Boats; Japanese Troops Set Fire to Kill People in Revenge

A dispatch from Rugao: The Japanese troops have been harassing Yancheng, Funing, and Gaobao recently and have suffered serious blows and casualties from the Chinese troops. Many of the Japanese troops stationed in the towns of Rugao have also been transferred to the front line, so the defense seems very weak. On the 6th of this month, the Chinese troops attacked Shizhuang, Xinsheng, Zhanghuang and other ports, and the fighting was quite fierce. In this battle, both sides suffered casualties. On the 15th, the Chinese troops planned to attack Xinsheng Port again. The Japanese troops in the port found out and released a motorboat carrying more than 20 Japanese and puppet troops to search the countryside near Liuwei Port (about 10 miles from Xinsheng Port). They found nothing and planned to return to the boat to return, but the tide fell, and the boat ran aground on the beach. The Japanese and puppet troops were unable to board the boat, so they ran back to report and sent a boat to tow it. The Chinese troops found out about this and immediately set fire to the boat and burned it. Later, another motorboat came, saw the situation, and was shocked. They set fire to more than 20 households in the areas of Liuwei Port and Doutianwei and killed more than 10 farmers, men, women, and children to vent their anger.

### Japanese and Puppet Troops Search and Retreat from Erzao Hong in Nanhui

(A dispatch from Nanhui) At 10 AM on the 16th, pseudo-police chief Gao Qiao Chen Wanghe led 80 puppet troops and 40 Japanese troops to search Erzao Hong in the east of Nanhui. They encountered the Loyalty and National Salvation Army Zhang Huifang's troops, Zhang Tianyou, Xu A'gen, etc., in Shijia浜, and a fierce battle broke out. After three hours of contact, the Japanese and puppet troops could not hold out and suffered more than a dozen casualties. They retreated to their original defenses.

### Senior Second Branch Court Criminal Division Chief Yu Hua Assassinated Yesterday Morning: Met Assailants Upon Leaving Residence, Shot Three Times and Died on the Spot

Yesterday morning at 9:05, an assassination occurred within Lane 150, Route Tenant de la Tour, in the French Concession. The assassinated person was the current Chief of the Criminal Division of the Senior Second Branch Court, Yu Hua. The details obtained from the investigation are recorded as follows:

Intending to Board a Chartered Car, Suddenly Encountered Assailants

Yesterday morning at 9:05, in Lane 150, across from the Pudong Bank office on Route Tenant de la Tour, a man in his fifties, wearing a gray silk-padded robe, was stepping into a chartered car outside the door of No. 202 to go out. Suddenly, three men lying in wait there drew guns and fired at him, firing a total of five shots. The man was hit by three bullets and fell to the ground. This injured man was none other than Yu Hua, the Chief of the Criminal Division of the Senior Second Branch Court.

Hit by Three Bullets, Died from Severe Wounds

Seeing Yu fall to the ground, the three thugs fled towards the road. Yu's driver was stunned like a wooden chicken. When the nearby patrolmen arrived and saw the situation, they immediately reported to the police station, which dispatched a large number of detectives and patrol cars to conduct a search. Yu was sent to Guangci Hospital, but the bullets had hit vital organs, so he died without being able to be saved. The bullets had struck him in the waist, chest, and heart, penetrating through to his back.

Lamented by the French Concession Legal Community, Grand Funeral Tomorrow

After Yu's death, the police transported the body to the autopsy room on Route Tenant de la Tour. At 3:00 PM, a prosecutor from the Special Second Court went to examine the body. Because it was confirmed that he had died from gunshot wounds sustained while alive, a coroner's report was completed, and the body was handed over to the family for the funeral. The bad news spread, and everyone in the legal community lamented his death. The body has now been moved to the Central Funeral Home on Route Mabileau, and a grand funeral is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.

Younger Brother Dafu, Renowned in the Literary World

Yu, courtesy name Manto, was from Fuyang, Zhejiang. He was 56 years old and had been in his current position in Shanghai for nearly ten years. He originally lived at No. 1 Rue Jules Pasteau but had just moved to No. 202 Route Tenant de la Tour at the end of last month. Yu deeply studied criminal law, and everyone praised him as a criminal law expert. Yu is survived by his wife, Biqin, two sons, and two daughters. The eldest son is already an adult, graduated from Tsinghua University, and recently went to the United States to study this spring. The second son is still a minor and is still studying. The eldest daughter is currently working in the mainland, and the youngest daughter is also studying. Yu formerly studied at Tokyo Hōdai University in Japan and served as a judge of the Supreme Court, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the third section chief of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. It is said that Yu Dafu, the current editor-in-chief of the Sin Chew Daily in Singapore, is Yu's younger brother. It is also known that Yu had recently taken a leave of absence at home and was going to court yesterday because his vacation was over when he was suddenly assassinated.

Served as an Official with Integrity, Always Upright and Impartial

Mr. Yu was known for his fairness in handling matters, not fearing the powerful, and not being tempted by bribes, so he was praised as a "clear sky." He was always upright and impartial in handling cases during his lifetime and had no personal enemies. It has not been heard that he had received any threatening letters. It is still difficult to predict whether this assassination was politically motivated. The police are currently doing their best to investigate the truth of the case and will bring the murderers to justice for interrogation.

### Ruirong Shipyard Strike: The Turmoil Expands, There Appears to be Instigation Behind the Scenes, Hoping for Labor-Management Cooperation, Not to be Manipulated

The Ruirong Shipyard in Yangshupu, Shanghai, owned by a British merchant, is quite large in scale. After the war, it still employed more than 4,000 workers, including long-term workers, short-term workers, and temporary contract workers. Recently, the factory dismissed more than 30 long-term workers who had served for many years. According to labor-management regulations, those who have worked for more than five years are to be given one month's dismissal pay for each year of service, but the factory only agreed to give each person 40 days of their original salary, which aroused dissatisfaction among all the workers. Although requests were made again and again, they were still ineffective. Therefore, more than 1,700 long-term workers in the factory went on strike the day before yesterday, and four representatives were elected to make demands to the factory: (1) Reinstate the dismissed workers; (2) Implement the labor-management regulations for dismissal; and vowed not to return to work until their goals were achieved. The factory's actual business is good, and it is constantly hiring new workers. The pseudo "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" saw an opportunity and sent people to lobby the workers, willing to be responsible for guaranteeing that the strike goals would be achieved. Before the issue is resolved, they will issue each worker their original salary, inducing the striking workers to register, charging each person a registration fee of one yuan. Uninformed workers, forced by circumstances, went to register, and as of the 23rd, there were already more than 800 people. Yesterday morning, when some short-term contract workers were working at the factory, the striking workers tried to persuade them not to work, which led to a misunderstanding with the Indian patrolmen on duty there, resulting in a conflict. As a result, two Indian patrolmen and five or six workers were slightly injured, and the workers' representatives were detained. The striking workers asked the "Welfare Association" to find a way to get them released, but they had not been released by the evening. The strike turmoil is becoming increasingly deadlocked and expanding, and its trends are quite noteworthy.

Workers Explain the Strike Situation

According to some workers in the factory: "Our Ruirong Shipyard has recently announced the dismissal of 32 old workers, which has caused dissatisfaction among the workers. Recently, a small number of workers joined the pseudo 'Chinese Workers' Welfare Association,' so yesterday (the 22nd) at around 6:00 AM, when we were going to work, there were more than ten people wearing pseudo-union badges and looking like workers guarding the factory gate, not allowing workers to enter the factory to work, and demanding that everyone go on strike, which led to a conflict. The factory notified the Yulin Road police station to send many patrolmen, and the ten or so people immediately began to fight with the Western patrolmen, resulting in injuries on both sides. However, I am a worker at the factory, and I am not very satisfied with the factory's measures this time, because I have completely sold my life's labor to earn money for the boss, but the price I get is not enough to support my family. When I get old and work a little slower, your boss prepares to fire us and doesn't want us anymore."

Hoping to Rely on One's Own Strength to Fight for Survival

"Of course, we should fight for survival, but survival depends on our own strength. Relying on the pseudo-union is useless. Can they really seek benefits for us? We can see from the recent strike results in other factories that the workers were sold out by the pseudo-union. I hope our Ruirong workers will all stick to our posts, truly unite, fight for our own survival, and use our own strength to improve our own lives."

### Ma Xiangbo's Third Seventh Day Today: Catholic Memorial Service Held at St. Joseph's Church on Catholic Church Street, People from All Walks of Life Can Freely Participate

After the death of centenarian Ma Xiangbo, today is the day of the third seventh. For the sake of remembrance, Ma's relatives and friends in Shanghai and Catholic parishioners have scheduled a memorial mass for the third seventh day at 7:30 AM today at the Catholic Church on Catholic Church Street. The details are recorded as follows:

Held This Morning: Third Seventh Day Memorial Service

This memorial mass for Ma's third seventh day was initiated by Father Zhang Deluo, the principal of Xuhui High School, together with Ma's relatives and friends and Catholic parishioners. In order to invite people from all walks of life to participate in the memorial service, special invitation letters were distributed. The invitation letter was printed with Ma's portrait, with the inscription in seal script "May the Holy Lord Grant Him Eternal Peace and Illuminate Him with Eternal Light," and attached a notice saying, "Centenarian Ma Xiangbo returned to the Lord on November 4th, the 28th year of the Republic of China. November 24th, 1939, 7:30 AM, Third Seventh Day Memorial Mass and Ceremony at St. Joseph's Church, Yangjingbang."

Principal Celebrant and Acolytes Respectively Appointed

Today's memorial mass ceremony will be held in St. Joseph's Church, located inside the Catholic Church on Catholic Church Street in the French Concession. Father Zhang Deluo, the principal of Xuhui High School, will serve as the principal celebrant, and Father Song and Father Jia of the Catholic Church will serve as acolytes. At that time, in addition to the Catholic parishioners in this city who will all go to participate, people from all walks of life can also freely join in, and one of Ma's nephews, Zhu Zhiyao's son, will be invited to play the piano. The ceremony will be solemn, and there will be a grand occasion.

### Rice Prices: May Plunge Sharply, Spot Supply Exceeds Demand, Fell Another Yuan Yesterday

The rice market turned weak after rising. After the rice merchants' tea party market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday, the spot market was flooded, and prices fell. Both the previous and subsequent market conditions fell by about one yuan and three or four cents. Yesterday, it was learned from the rice industry that the rice market can be considered stable in the future. In addition to trying to lower rice prices, rice industry groups are also doing their best to urge transportation. According to the previous demand for 10,000 bags of rice per day in Shanghai, the current demand is only 7,000 to 8,000 bags due to the obvious reduction in residents, and the residents have sufficient rice reserves, so the actual amount will definitely not reach this number. Therefore, the rice market in Shanghai is balanced between sales and supply, and the spot supply exceeds demand. The rice and grain inventory will increase day by day within half a month, and rice prices may plunge sharply at that time.

Executive Yuan's Circular

In order to regulate the people's food supply during wartime, the National Food Administration Committee, in addition to ordering the provinces to strictly control food transportation, has recently, due to the abundant rice production in various provinces this year, presented a request to the Executive Yuan for a circular to all provinces and cities to prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating and smuggling exports, stipulating that anyone who raises rice prices without permission or smuggles exports will be severely punished in accordance with military law.

Limiting Rice Prices

It is now learned that the Executive Yuan has ordered the provincial and municipal governments to set the highest rice price in rice-producing provinces and counties at no more than 20 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), and the highest rice price in non-rice-producing areas at no more than 30 yuan per shi. Those who illegally smuggle exports will be punished by military law.

### Caogadu Pseudo Self-Defense Corps Suddenly Declared Dissolution

No. 93 Lutsze House, Bailinan Road, the over-the-border road in West Shanghai, was originally the site of the former Caonan Elementary School. On the morning of October 1st, it was occupied by the so-called "Shanghai Special Municipality West Shanghai Caogadu Self-Defense Corps." These people were supported by the Japanese and puppets and had full armaments. The pseudo leader's name was Hu Deshan, and the pseudo corps members numbered about a hundred people. After the pseudo-organization was established, it

Began Activities

Openly posted announcements saying that because the concession was unable to protect the residents of Caogadu, they were implementing "self-defense." Under the pretext of expanding the troops and purchasing "self-defense military equipment," they sent people every day to forcibly collect cash from nearby residents to provide funds for these people to squander. Those who violated this

Would Inevitably Be Arrested

And subjected to cruel torture. As a result, the general well-to-do residents were terrified, and many moved away to avoid trouble. When these people's schemes failed, they became even more intense, and under the pretext of searching for guerrillas, they broke into people's homes in the middle of the night, rummaging through boxes and cabinets. If no property was found, they would falsely accuse them of

Hiding Weapons

And tie up the original owner in the corps, torturing them to extract a confession, and only allow them to be redeemed after paying a considerable price. Residents who suffered from their poisoning numbered several a day. The various terrorist actions caused everyone who heard about them to turn pale. On the 10th of this month, 16 of these pseudo "corps members" were

Extorting Money

On Bailinan Road, when they were arrested by the British defense forces, although they were able to have all their weapons confiscated and released with the support of the Japanese and puppets, after ten days of detention, their arrogance was greatly reduced. Until the day before yesterday, this pseudo-organization surprisingly announced its dissolution.

### Japanese Planes Bombed in Hankou Are Continuously Transported to Shanghai

After the Hankou Japanese airfield was bombed twice by the Chinese Air Force, the damaged planes were continuously transported to Shanghai. After more than a dozen planes were transported last time, at 9:00 AM yesterday, another Japanese transport ship, the Xindong Maru, transported a damaged plane from the Yangtze River. The head, propeller blades, and tail rudder were all bombed away, and the wings were also damaged. The ship was docked at the China Merchants Northern Wharf for unloading. In addition, there were four other damaged planes piled up at the wharf yesterday, which were also transported from Hankou. It is estimated that more than 20 damaged planes have been transported from Hankou to Shanghai, both before and after.

### Japanese Statement: The Panama Ship Has Not Been Released

The Dalu Newspaper reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy told reporters yesterday (the 22nd) that the Shanghai management office of the Panama ship Polivar said on Tuesday that the ship had been released after being detained by the Japanese. In fact, it was still being detained yesterday. It will not be released until the owner's problem is completely resolved. According to the phenomenon, the ship may belong to Nova Merchants, but the Chinese deputy who was detained a few weeks ago was released on Tuesday.

### Master Yuanying Escaped Danger: Immediately Escorted to Nanjing for Interrogation the Day After Being Arrested, Was Escorted Back to Shanghai on the 14th and Was Released Yesterday

Master Yuanying, the chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, was arrested by the Japanese on the 19th of last month and was not officially out of danger until yesterday. At noon yesterday, he hosted a banquet at Yuanying Lecture Hall on Daxilu to thank the friends who rescued him. A reporter from Datong News Agency recorded the details as follows:

Arrested and Escorted to Nanjing

After Master Yuanying was taken away by the Japanese on the 19th of last month, he was immediately detained in the Japanese military unit in Hongkou on the same day. The next day, he was escorted to Nanjing and detained in the Nanjing Japanese Military Police Headquarters. He was interrogated once on the 22nd.

Interrogated Once

Only then did he learn that his arrest was caused by someone in Nanjing falsely accusing him of being an "anti-Japanese" element. As a result of the interrogation that day, the Japanese realized that the accusation was not true. Although he was still detained in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters from the 24th, he was treated more favorably.

Returned to Shanghai on the 14th

Since then, the Japanese have used the excuse of investigation, and he has been detained for 27 days. He was finally escorted back to Shanghai by the Japanese on the 14th of this month. Although he left Hongkou immediately after arriving in Shanghai, because he had to go through the release procedures, he did not officially regain his freedom until yesterday (the 22nd). He spent one month and five days from his arrest to his escape. Except for the night of his arrest when he was detained in Hongkou, the rest of the time was spent in Nanjing, and he was not involved in Jiangwan at all.

Future Conduct

After Master Yuanying officially escaped danger yesterday, he revisited Yuanying Lecture Hall on Daxilu at 10:00 AM. For a time, monks and laity and devotees gathered to inquire. Then, at 12:00 noon, he set up a vegetarian banquet to thank the friends who had been running around to rescue him. During the banquet, he said that he would soon leave Shanghai for the South Seas to continue to preach Buddhism.

### Fifty-Cent Stamps Are on Sale Today

The fifty-cent stamps issued by the Shanghai Postal Administration were once interrupted, resulting in the postal office replacing them with two twenty-five-cent stamps for postage to foreign countries, which was very inconvenient for senders. Recently, the postal office has doubled the postage to foreign countries, and the need for fifty-cent stamps is even more urgent. In view of this, the postal office has re-printed a large number from the United Kingdom and has decided to start selling them simultaneously at the main office on North Sichuan Road and various postal branches from today.

### Japanese and Puppet Regime Attempt to Reorganize the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau, Japanese to Undertake Dredging Work, The Purpose is Nothing More Than to Seize Power and Plunder Profits

The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that, according to Japanese sources, as a result of frequent negotiations between the British, American, and Japanese authorities and the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau, the Whangpoo dredging work, which had been suspended for two years, is expected to resume soon. The Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau may be reorganized, with Tax Commissioner Luo Fude, Port Director Shanshan, and the pseudo "Jianghai Customs Supervisor" Li Jiannan as directors, and Japanese personnel appointed to other positions. The dredging work will be carried out with Japanese assistance. When the dredging is completed, it will slightly prevent the flooding of roads in the city.

### After Participating in Thanksgiving, the US Ambassador Will Go North This Morning, Expected to Arrive in Qinhuangdao Around the 27th

US Ambassador to China Johnson, originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for the north today on the Kailuan Coal Mine Company's Kaiping ship, temporarily changed his plan and purchased a ticket for the Aoc Shipping Company's Serpentine Hutchinson on the 22nd. However, because American merchants in this city pleaded for him to leave Shanghai after participating in Thanksgiving, he changed his plan again and still took the Kaiping ship north. A reporter from Dachung News Agency learned last night that the Kaiping ship left the Kaiping Bureau Wharf in Pudong at 4:00 AM this morning and is expected to arrive in Qinhuangdao on the morning of the 27th.

It is Rumored That Kato Will Also Go to Beiping

The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that the rumor this morning (the 23rd) that US Ambassador to China Johnson left Shanghai last night (the 22nd) is not accurate. In fact, Ambassador Johnson will travel north on the Kailuan Coal Mine Company's Kaiping (transliteration) ship tonight. It is reported that Ambassador Johnson met with Japanese special envoy Kato yesterday morning to discuss various issues related to China. Ambassador Johnson is going to Beiping this time to reunite with his family, and Kato will also go to Beiping, where they may continue to talk.

### Foreign Merchants Transporting Fresh Eggs to Shanghai Are Still Being Extorted, The Eggs Seized by Mitsui Have Not Yet Been Fully Compensated

The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that Mitsui & Co. has successively seized more than 5,000 baskets of eggs from two American companies and five British companies since October 10. Because the newspapers revealed this, the public was indignant, and the Japanese authorities reacted. Mitsui & Co. began to gradually return the seized eggs to their original owners. In the past two or three days, hundreds of baskets of eggs have been returned, but Mitsui & Co. is still extorting money for the new eggs purchased by these foreign companies and transported to this city. In addition to charging a purchase permit fee of 2 yuan per basket of fresh eggs, it also charges a handling fee of 50 cents. Although third-country companies object, they have to pay this extortionate fee, otherwise they cannot obtain fresh eggs. Foreign companies are trying to eliminate this illegal extortion, as it contradicts the open-door policy that the Japanese claim to abide by. Egg merchants must be satisfied until all the seized eggs are compensated and the illegal extortion is abolished.

### Silk Factory: Part of the Factory Resumed Work, Many Machines Are Still Being Repaired

The Dalu Newspaper reported that an official of the British-owned Luen Shing Company said yesterday (the 22nd) that the workers' strike in the company's Pudong factory had lasted for nearly half a year, and that only a part of those who stopped the strike on Friday of last week had returned to work in the factory, but it is unlikely that all work will resume at present, as the necessary repairs to the machines are still in progress. The factory and the striking workers reached a resolution last week, but the details are not yet known for sure. However, according to unofficial sources, the end of the dispute did not bring significant benefits to the workers.

### Returning from Zhabei

— Yuan

In a bright morning, I had the pass to Zhabei that I had obtained the night before in my pocket. I got off at the terminus of the No. 17 trolleybus at the Sichuan Road Bridge, and I wondered uneasily in my heart what my old home, which I had left for more than two years, had become! With a nostalgic mood, I finally raised my head and embarked on the journey.

Crossing the bridge that lies across both sides of the Suzhou River, I arrived at the northern end of Sichuan Road: there, the atmosphere of a yellow utopia could be seen. Soldiers of the Allied forces in yellow uniforms, carrying guns and wearing command knives, accounted for one-third of the pedestrians. I didn't want to look at that "friendly" face either, and I hurried on my way with my head down. What joint-stock companies, foreign firms, restaurants... all disappeared quickly in the corner of my eye.

When Qiujiang Road came into my sight, it was just patches of barren land; no, dilapidated walls and rubble were still piled messily on the ground. There were many workers, with their backs bent, doing cleaning work there. There were also several trucks parked next to them, clearly painted with the words "China Reconstruction War Zone Cleaning Team" on them. The trucks were full of steel, bricks, tiles, wood, etc., that had just been excavated by the workers.

In the middle section of Qiujiang Road, there was a newly built rectangular stone tablet, with slogans written in large characters on each side of the tablet. The same slogans were also found on the electric wire poles and on the walls of the newly repaired houses.

Turning from Qiujiang Road into Baotong Road, the air here was more peaceful than on Qiujiang Road - no soldiers could be seen. The words ×××× rented for imperial use appeared under the eaves of several houses that had been repaired not long ago. Twenty or thirty poor compatriots were living that "utopian" life, raising five or six fully feathered ducks in front of their doors, which walked around leisurely.

My old home was getting closer and closer, and my heart was beating faster and faster. After a while, my old home, which I had dreamed of day and night for two years, stood巍然 before my eyes. I quickly rubbed my eyes with my handkerchief, but I still couldn't rub away the current scene. My footsteps couldn't help but lighten up, and I accelerated towards my old home.

My old home, which had been baptized by artillery fire, was very different from what it had been two years ago: bullet holes covered the entire wall, and there were two large depressions in the lawn in front of the house, perhaps caused by bombs.

I walked up the stairs from the bottom floor, which was full of broken bricks, wall ashes, and mess. The tables, chairs, books, etc., that we used to read and write on... everything was no longer present in front of me. I only picked up a few photos covered with mud from the shattered and rotten piles of broken paper. I stood there blankly, looking back at the scene of the previous interior decoration. Now, it was a desolate scene, a ruin. White clouds and grey dogs, how can one not be moved by it!

Suddenly, a white pigeon with undeveloped feathers flew past the window. Ah! This was the white pigeon I had raised two years ago. I rushed to the window in great joy, looking up and staring, staring at my beloved white pigeon. Oh! One two three!... Only five. Then, the impressions of two years ago were reflected in my eyes one scene after another. More than a hundred lively and exquisite chicks. Ducklings. And the wolf dog that guarded the door. Clear and lovely tropical fish. That little white rabbit. White swallows, etc., were no longer mine! I excitedly ran downstairs to the garden to search, but these eventually became a dream.

In the garden, thorny weeds had usurped the place and occupied the entire garden. Willows, mulberries, cherry blossoms, and apricot trees, the dead were dead, and the withered were withered, but the loquat tree planted by my father still struggled out of the thorns very luxuriantly, and it already had immature crystal products—buds. I blessed it, hoping that it would bloom and bear fruit in the harsh environment—the cold autumn and winter.

In the grass, the sound of insects chirped, like a complaint, as if reporting something. My heart was beating even more violently.

The shadow under the sun gradually shortened, silently telling me that it was almost noon. I slowly dragged my heavy footsteps and embarked on the return journey. Walking along Baotong Road through Baoyuan Road, I found a road sign that had been bombed in half, still standing barely on the side of the road. Walking, walking, and walking again, I approached the school gate. Ah! The school building had been baptized by artillery fire, leaving half of its shell, but it still stood雄偉 with its wounded body. Looking down at its surroundings, "It is like a soldier who has gone through hundreds of battles, looking down on his peers. It is the pillar of the country." I thought quietly. The bright school badge was still completely left on the top of the school gate. The words "Guangdong Junior High School" on the horizontal plaque in front of the school building were still faintly visible. The situation of the school building after being destroyed during the January 28th Incident swirled in my mind again. Artillery fire can only destroy the shell of the school, it can never destroy its spirit. I hope that one day, it will still be able to continue its original sacred duty—nurturing Chinese citizens.

Woo, woo, woo, the train rumbled past on the tracks next to the school building. Then, I left the embrace of my alma mater, and with a full of sadness, I speeded up my footsteps and walked over the Sichuan Road Bridge before I could breathe a sigh of relief.

### Red Cross Strengthens Sichuan Province Relief Efforts: Shanghai Doctors and Nurses Arrive in Chongqing; Jiangsu Medical College Organizes Volunteer Treatment Team

Since Sichuan Province became the wartime capital after the establishment of the National Government's wartime headquarters, it has become the central point for military and political resistance. Japanese aircraft frequently scout and seize opportunities to launch air raids, making relief efforts crucial. Through gradual improvements, these efforts have become well-established. According to a letter from Chongqing, several dozen doctors and nurses from the Shanghai Joint First and Second Teams have already arrived in Chongqing. A volunteer treatment team from Jiangsu Medical College is also in Chongqing assisting with relief work. Details are as follows:

Various Counties in Sichuan

Faced with the constant threat of air raids, local authorities place great importance on local relief efforts. Mr. Tang Chengzong, director of the Chongqing office of the Chinese Red Cross Society, recognizing this, has now

Drafted a Plan

and submitted it to the headquarters for approval. The plan aims to strengthen the relief capabilities of the existing Red Cross Society branch offices in various counties of Sichuan Province. Mr. Tang will soon, along with senior medical personnel dispatched by the relief headquarters of the society, depart for an inspection. They will first

Improve Organization

and then, based on actual needs, provide appropriate subsidies of medicine or funds. In addition, they are actively preparing to establish branch offices in the counties along the rivers and highways of Sichuan Province that do not yet have them and have already telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Government to order the counties to begin preparations. Furthermore, several dozen doctors and nurses from the Shanghai Joint First and Second Teams

Have Already Arrived in Chongqing

The First Team is responsible for medical work at the Red Cross Chongqing Hospital, while the Second Team is responsible for mobile treatment, providing services in the evacuation zones of Chongqing City during peacetime. When an outside county is affected by disaster, they will immediately travel to the disaster area in ambulances to provide relief. In addition, at the request of the Red Cross, Jiangsu Medical College has organized, with professors and students, a

Volunteer Treatment

Team, which is also under the command of the Red Cross Chongqing office and can be dispatched at any time to undertake relief work.

### Shanghai Post Office Stops Mailing Parcels to Germany and France

Since the outbreak of the European war, the Shanghai Postal Administration has continued to accept parcels to Germany that passed through France.

### Rickshaw Company Owners Exploit Rickshaw Pullers with Fines and Violate Regulations by Increasing Rickshaw Rental Fees: Twelve Companies Fined

In order to protect rickshaw pullers, the Public Concession’s Municipal Council issued an order in January 1937 to all rickshaw owners stating that the full-day (24-hour) rental fee should not exceed 77 cents in legal tender; otherwise, they would be subject to severe penalties. However, most rickshaw owners,

Exploiting Rickshaw Pullers

cared only about lining their own pockets and generally disobeyed the Municipal Council's orders. They usually increased the rental fee to 94 cents, an increase of 17 cents over the Municipal Council's regulation. If a rickshaw owner owned 200 rickshaws, they could increase their income by an additional $1,020 per month. This situation was discovered by the Municipal Council's Transportation Office, which began an investigation and found that

Violators of the Regulations Currently Include: Lu Zhenhuang, No. 366 Shanhai Pass Road; Sanmin Company, No. 345 Changping Road; Rixin Company, No. 527 Haifang Road; China Anbu Company; Wang Yuant'i, No. 194 North Xizang Road; Lu Huangshi, No. 588 Maigen Road; and Yin Youlan, No. 5, Lane 324, No. 324 Haifang Road and twelve others. Accordingly, Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Municipal Council's Legal Department, filed a lawsuit against these twelve companies with the Special First Court's Prohibition Tribunal in accordance with Article 34 of the Municipal Council's Transportation Regulations, which states that "those who violate the regulations by

Overcharging Rickshaw Rental Fees

shall be fined 100 yuan for the first offense, and 25 yuan for every 24 hours thereafter." Yesterday morning, Judge Sheng opened the court to summon the defendants. The police lawyer Zhang argued that the rickshaw owners relied on the income from rickshaw rentals for their livelihood and were already able to live comfortably, yet they still ruthlessly exploited the impoverished rickshaw pullers. Therefore, they should be severely punished; otherwise, it would not be enough

To Serve as a Warning.

However, due to the limitations of the regulations, he requested that the court impose the maximum fine allowed by the regulations so that the rickshaw pullers could be protected. After questioning by Judge Sheng, the twelve defendant rickshaw owners were each fined 100 yuan as a warning. It is reported that this is the first time such an incident has occurred.

### Young Girl Raped and Then Sold: Refugee Camp Staff Member Wei Feigen is Inhumanly Wicked

Wei Feigen (age 26), a native of Pudong, was an employee at the No. 7 Refugee Camp on Peng Road. In March of last year, Song Yunnan (age 20), a woman from Yinxiang Township who lived in the Shenxin No. 7 Factory workers' quarters on Binlang Road, often visited her aunt at the refugee camp. She was seduced by Wei, who later took her to a hotel room and raped her, and they met secretly from time to time. Recently, Wei Feigen became addicted to gambling and the salary he earned at the camp was not enough for his extravagance. Therefore, he had malicious intentions and earlier this month, sold Song to Wang A'gen, a fellow villager living at No. 10 Kaifeng Road, as his wife for the price of 40 yuan. At 10:00 AM on the 5th, Wang A'gen held a wedding feast at the Hongyunlou Restaurant at No. 236 Arlabasdr Road. Song, being a simple village woman, had no choice but to obey Wei's arrangements, not daring to oppose him for fear of his brutality. Unexpectedly, Song's father, Song Xiansheng, arrived in Shanghai from the countryside the day before yesterday, learned of the situation, and reported it to the French police station. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Wei and take him to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was brought before the Special First Court, where Judge Liu Yugui interrogated him, and based on his clear confession, ordered him to be returned to custody to await sentencing at a later date.

### Youth Living with Mistress Accused of Adultery

Wang Yilin, a young man from Ningbo, age 22, living at No. 12, Lane 142, Zhao Zhujiao Road, currently works as a clerk at the Xiangxing Foreign Firm with a monthly salary of 30 yuan. He has been living with Zhang Jianying, a woman from Shaoxing, age 25, for four years and they have a daughter, age three. However, Wang, hindered by his grandmother's disapproval of his cohabitation with Zhang, married Zhang Meiqing, a woman from his hometown, age 22, through a matchmaker last year. Unexpectedly, Wang and Zhang did not get along. Since their marriage, they have never shared a bed and are as incompatible as ice and charcoal. Wang left Zhang alone at No. 149 Chongqing Road, neglecting her. Wang's parents also did not approve of Wang's cohabitation with Zhang and tried to persuade Wang to separate from Zhang, but Wang stubbornly refused. His father deeply resented Wang's unfilial conduct and published a notice severing their father-son relationship. Wang continued to live with Zhang as before. Recently, Zhang learned of Wang's residence and reported it to the French police station the day before yesterday. The police dispatched detectives to catch them in the act and arrested both Wang and Zhang. That afternoon, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, where the police lawyer prosecuted them for adultery and disrupting the family. After questioning by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, it was decided to postpone the hearing until the 29th to summon Wang Yilin's parents to appear in court for further questioning.

The incident stemmed from a dispute on the 19th when Xu and others had dinner at the Yuhe Restaurant and consumed food and drinks worth about $1.56 but only paid one dollar. The restaurant asked for the remainder, leading to the feud and this unfortunate incident. The detectives arrested Xu and the other three men and brought them before the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the circumstances, stating that the case still required investigation and requested permission to detain the suspects for one week pending further investigation and prosecution. After questioning by Judge Jiang Shuzi, Xu Shujin and the other three men were ordered to be remanded in custody and the hearing was postponed.

### Nanton Middle School Principal Zhao Weizu Arrested Yesterday, Currently Detained at Central Police Station

The Nanton Middle School and the 30th Shelter of the Ciliang Branch Association were originally located in the Shengjia Ancestral Hall at No. 11 Jessfield Road in western Shanghai. The Nanton Middle School had a total of more than 200 students. The principal of the school was Zhao Weizu, a native of Nanhui, who was extremely enthusiastic about charitable causes.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: We are writing on behalf of our client, Ms. Xu Liangzhen, who states that she read a news item in the local news section of the Shenbao on the 22nd of this month entitled "Disagreement Between Unmarried Couple on Wedding". After investigating, we found that the news item was inconsistent with the facts. The engagement between Ms. Xu and Mr. Pu was arranged by their parents when they were young. Ms. Xu believes that marriage is a lifelong commitment to happiness and has long expressed her opposition to this illegal marriage. At that time, it was still before the war, and she had not yet come of age, so she did not actively advocate for it. The report stated that the wedding was wavering due to the destruction of Mr. Pu's property, which wrongly implies that Ms. Xu's motivation for denying the wedding was based on money, which is inaccurate. The reported amount of engagement gifts and jewelry is even more untrue. We especially ask your esteemed newspaper to instruct your lawyer to send a letter on our behalf to correct the report. We would be most grateful. Sincerely, Sun Zuji, Lawyer, Local News Section, Shenbao, November 23rd.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Market Was Quite Tense in the Early Morning; Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger and Japanese Banks Frequently Absorbed Forward Contracts; Market Situation Was Relatively Stable in the Afternoon

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: HSBC's listed rates did not fluctuate. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates continued to tighten. The pre-day's storm had already revealed clues, finally erupting at the opening in the morning. Although the momentum did not seem to over-expand, and general merchants took advantage of the high prices to sell, the exchange market had broken away from the state of fluctuation and entered a competitive arena. The subsequent market reversed and became stagnant, so the result was still relatively stable. At the opening, British and American exchange rates sharply contracted by a huge 5.25 points, leading to a sharp tightening of both the British and American exchange rates in the early morning, calculated as 5 pence and 25 points and 8 and a half yuan respectively. Subsequently, Huajian and Sassoon and other companies also started to compete, and the strong benefit of recent strong ingestion was still not satisfied, and they continued to absorb strongly. For a time, the market situation was chaotic. At that time, most operators did not know what to do with buying and selling. The trend of softness has been difficult to reverse. At one point, the British currency tightened to 5 pence and 18.75 points, and the American exchange rate also reported 8 yuan and 375 points. Subsequently, the cotton yarn gang decided to take advantage of the high prices to sell forward contracts, and the banks that absorbed them also hovered without moving forward, and then saw it return to stability, to 5 pence and 25 points and 8 and a half yuan. The price was exactly the same as the morning opening. By noon, the transaction suddenly thinned, and the situation stabilized. Until the afternoon, it was still stagnant and unchanged. Only the Japanese banks and North China frequently absorbed forward contracts, but the speculators vomited them, which was enough to offset each other, and the trend was slightly softer. By the close, the British gold was 5 pence and 12875 points, and the American exchange rate was 8 yuan and 4375 points, which was British tighter by .03125 and American softer by .15625 compared to the previous day. As for the futures market situation, it was originally the same as the spot market, and there were also transactions.

Yarn and Flower Gang Took Advantage of the High Prices to Sell

At the beginning of the morning, the London big bar was almost flat at .0625, the New York silver price remained flat, the London raw gold was stagnant, the exchange rate between Britain and the United States and France was flat, the exchange rate to Shanghai contracted by .0625, the exchange rate from the United States to Britain fell sharply by 5.25 points, the exchange rate to Shanghai decreased by 5 points, and the exchange rate to France decreased by 1.875 points. The Central Bank's listed rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 5 pence and 25 points for British gold and 8 and a half yuan for American exchange, which was flat for British and tighter by .09375 for American compared to the previous closing. Because of the sharp drop in exchange rates, the banks that absorbed were quite nervous. Chinese merchants first settled into a bank's December American exchange rate of 10,000 yuan, which was 8 yuan and 4375 points. Then, Sassoon and other foreign banks also competed to absorb a certain bank's spot British gold at 5 pence and 25 and 21875 points and spot American exchange at 8 yuan and 4375 and 375 points. Therefore, the process was quite soft. When HSBC's listed rates were announced to be unchanged and the balance tax on silver was announced to be neither increased nor decreased, the tightest British gold once called over 5 pence and 1875 points. Subsequently, the cotton yarn gang suddenly took advantage of the high prices to sell forward contracts, and at the same time, Hong Kong also sent a telegram to sell out, so the potential stopped tightening and turned hard. It is estimated that the cotton yarn gang sold to a certain bank's December American exchange rate of 8 yuan and 375 and 4375 points. Later, the Hong Kong telegram sold the spot British gold at 5 pence and 234375 and 25 points to Huabi Datong. At the same time, the spot American exchange also returned to hard to 8 and a half yuan. The situation stabilized slightly at noon. By noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was 5 pence and 234375 points for British gold and 8 yuan and 46875 points for American exchange, which was 15625 points tighter for British and continued to be .03125 softer for American compared to the morning opening. It was heard that it was slightly softer after closing, with British gold estimated at 5 pence and 21875 points and American exchange at 8 yuan and 4375 points.

British and American Exchange Rates Were Both Tightened

The state of the after-market suddenly turned quiet. There were few spot British and American exchange transactions, so the price was also very stagnant. It was only heard that Japanese banks and Huabi absorbed Chinese and foreign banks' December American exchange rate of 8 yuan and 34375 and 375 points. After entering the market, the situation became even more quiet. Until the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price was 5 pence and 21875 points for British gold and 8 yuan and 4375 points for American exchange, December British gold was 5 pence and 15625 points, and American exchange was 8 yuan and 3125 points. As a result, both the spot British gold and the spot American gold were tighter by .03125 and softer by .15625 compared to the previous day.

### Though Securities Dealers Tried Hard to Sell, the Gold Market Still Soared; Exchange Rates Tightened Again... Operators All Looked Towards Prosperity, Trading Brisk in the Morning, Quiet in the Afternoon... Peak at 3755 Yuan

Yesterday, the spot gold market was bullish, continuing its prosperous trend. With the exchange market trending towards tightening, operators were all talking about rising gold prices. A certain money exchange firm continued to buy aggressively after its purchases the day before, accumulating a considerable amount. However, in keeping with the usual practices of securities dealers, they also sold heavily. Furthermore, many general retail bulls continued to emerge, making it difficult for the gold price to rise significantly. As a result, it only increased by a little over twenty yuan. Early in the morning, there were reports of the exchange market softening, further strengthening the psychology of prosperity, and so the market opened at 3730 yuan, up twenty-six yuan. Subsequently, buyers surged in like a tide, with a certain money exchange firm buying fervently, pushing the price up to a peak of 3755 yuan. Afterwards, although the buying intention of the money exchange firm remained strong, the securities dealers were selling aggressively, so the position was relatively balanced for a time, fluctuating around 3735 yuan. Later, the exchange rate stopped tightening and returned to normal, and the securities dealers increased their sales efforts. At the same time, retail investors also showed a strong desire to sell. As a result, those looking to buy paused to observe, causing a sharp drop to a low of 3710 yuan. At noon, a certain money exchange firm resumed buying, lifting the price by fifteen yuan. By closing, the price was 3722 yuan. In the afternoon, the exchange rate softened slightly after the noon close, causing the opening price to rise by thirteen yuan. Afterwards, the exchange market turned sluggish, and the gold price showed little fluctuation, only rising or falling by about ten yuan. The securities dealers continued to sell, while a certain gold firm and money exchange firm absorbed, without any reaction. By the late close, the price was still 3733 yuan, a further increase of twenty-nine yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was quite brisk in the morning, but somewhat quiet in the afternoon, with a total of 2350 taels traded. Jewelry gold was listed at a premium of five yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained stable.

Spot Gold Continues to Rise, Up 29 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) continued the momentum of the previous day. With the exchange market tightening, general speculators were excited. Brokers shouted loudly, and a certain money exchange firm showed particularly strong buying interest. The market opened with a jump of twenty-six yuan, with the securities dealers taking in twenty taels of gold at 3730 yuan. Afterwards, more buyers surged in, sending the price soaring another twenty-five yuan, with the money exchange firm acquiring thirty taels of gold at 3755 yuan. Subsequently, because the securities dealers leaned towards selling, and the money exchange firm's appetite turned sluggish, the price suddenly dropped, soon falling back twenty-five yuan. The securities dealers sold fifty taels to jewelry dealers at 3730 yuan. Then, with the jewelry dealers continuing to absorb, and the exchange market still tight, the price rose another fifteen yuan, with the money exchange firms trading seventy taels among themselves at 3745 yuan. At that time, the exchange rate suddenly turned firm, and selling resumed. The jewelry dealers also stopped buying, and the securities dealers' selling pressure was strong, immediately falling back twenty yuan. The jewelry dealers sold thirty taels to the money exchange firms at 3725 yuan. Later, the buying sound of a certain money exchange firm was very loud, forcibly taking in over five hundred taels. For a time, many bulls took the opportunity to raise prices, although quite a few retail investors came out to sell, but the price was eventually raised fifteen yuan. A certain money exchange firm took in twenty taels from a fellow firm at 3740 yuan. Afterwards, the money exchange firm stopped absorbing, and the price immediately fell back. The securities dealers and a certain Yu & Co., along with retail investors, rushed to sell. With the exchange market continuing to firm, most of those looking to buy observed, and the market lacked support. Before long, it collapsed thirty yuan, with the money exchange firms selling twenty taels to a certain silver firm at 3710 yuan. Near noon, there were reports that the exchange rate had stopped loosening and was slightly tightening, and sellers gradually decreased. In addition, a certain money exchange firm resumed buying, and the underlying trend became firm again, soon rising fifteen yuan. A certain money exchange firm took in twenty taels from the jewelry dealers at 3725 yuan. Later, the securities dealers sold thirty yuan to the money exchange firms, a small discount of three yuan, for a noon closing price of 3722 yuan. It was heard that after the close, the exchange rate softened slightly, pulling the price up to around 3730 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, a certain gold firm was the first to pull in, raising the price by several yuan, acquiring thirty taels from the money exchange firms, one at 3735 yuan. Then, floating shorts covered their positions, and the price rose another five yuan, with the jewelry dealers taking in twenty taels from the money exchange firms at 3740 yuan.

As a result, the price continued to rise twenty-nine yuan compared to the previous day, fluctuating forty-five yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the current gold firm's own brand of gold was ten yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by a little over twenty yuan. The current standard gold was listed five or six tens of yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

### British and American Gold Bills in High Demand

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market situation, because of the economic mission of Mr. Kodama's visit to China, people were nervous. Clients absorbed British and American gold pounds very hard, and the market price was strong and rising. British and American gold bills were also in high demand, and the market price was outstanding.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Show Strong Buying Interest; Foreign Stock Market is Exceptionally Strong

Yesterday's unofficial securities market situation: the environment was still unfavorable to the bulls. Since both sides were silent on the issue of peace negotiations, and the previously rumored mediator was overwhelmed, one side sent Kodama to China, with a very large conspiracy. The bulls were on guard against drastic changes, and were struggling to fiercely pull up the prices after they had fallen. After the noon close, they used the space to buy a small number of shares, and the market price rose again. Class C shares rose again above the 7-yuan mark, but the bulls' barriers were also built higher as a result, and many floating shorts were liquidated. Yesterday morning, Chang Kee and Tung Hong bought in at the low, and No. 41 increased its holdings again, so after Sheng Da sold out and continued to fall, it immediately rose. Wing Hong, Yik Da, and other firms also supplied, but many retail investors filled their positions along with the market. The noon close reversed from a decline to a rise. In the afternoon, Da Hong, Cheng Yuan, and Da Song Mao bought in again, while Xie Da, San Kai, and others sold, and the bulls and bears fought fiercely. However, market rumors did not stop, and the market prices mostly recovered by 1 to 4 cents. 96 shares were traded at 5 cents, totaling about 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 20 shares of Commercial Press stock were traded at a price of 67 yuan and 50 cents.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese General Chamber of Commerce stock market saw a small number of floating longs emerge in the morning, and the price support was good. Steel stocks alone were outstanding, continuing the upward trend of the previous day. The closing price in the morning was 16 yuan and 40 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, all stocks again showed a strong upward trend. Although many people took profits, buyers still occupied an absolute advantage, and the closing market situation was extremely firm.

London, 22nd dispatch: Today, the listing prices of Country A's foreign bonds returned to stability, and all public bonds in the upper and lower ranges remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Increased Costs, Optimism for Cotton Yarn, Many Speculators Buying, Prices Rise by Around 10 Yuan

The bullish trend in the yarn market has revived. This is because although overseas American cotton is stable, the Indian cotton market is advancing single-mindedly, and the upward trend is fierce, causing excitement. Currently, because inventories are still plentiful, there is no major obstacle for the time being. Everyone is optimistic about the future, because going forward, factory costs will increase daily. Therefore, those who have no goods in hand are coming back to buy a few bales to speculate, and although Hong Kong merchants have not developed in large quantities, they are also buying with confidence in view of the expensive raw materials, so it is not as sluggish as in the past.

When the current yarn market opened in the morning, fellow merchants gathered, and Indian cotton prices advanced steadily, jumping another ten rupees, stirring up sentiment and raising prices. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened with a rise of ten yuan, to 653 yuan. Then, as the exchange rate tightened, sentiment became even tighter. However, those who made profits closed their positions, falling back four or five yuan, but there were still many people buying in. It is estimated that 1490 bales were traded in half a day. The prices of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 9 yuan, Tian Nu yarn by 8 yuan, and Shuang Di Qiu yarn by 6 yuan. The amounts purchased by each merchant are listed as follows:

Fellow Merchants 660 Hong Kong 530

Xiamen 60 Ningbo 90 Mainland 120

Total 1495

### Indian Cotton Prices Rise More Sharply; Brazilian Cotton Traded Yesterday

Cotton trading continued to progress, but factory transactions decreased due to price issues. However, fellow merchants are mostly bullish in view of the advancing Indian cotton, so trading is extremely prosperous. Fortunately, the situation in American cotton is still peaceful, and the market price is hampered by it, otherwise the upward trend would be very strong. And the price of American cotton is cheaper than that of Indian cotton, and the color is also beautiful, so the purchase orders of fellow merchants and factories are increasing daily. There are some purchases in Qingdao, all of which are Brazilian cotton, 1 inch 1/16 fine velvet, the raw material for spinning fine 32-count yarn, but the amount is not large, so the cotton market's upward force is still gentle. However, in addition to the rise of 2 yuan for regular cotton, the source of Su Bei is relatively scarce, because the rain is continuous, and transportation in the countryside is inconvenient, so the arrival of goods is slightly less. 892 bales of regular cotton arrived, 489 bales of Chang Yin Sha cotton, and 720 pieces of Bei Sha Lai cotton. The current situation of spot cotton is listed on the left.

Another dispatch: the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, continued to rise in the morning due to telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reporting soaring prices. Later, because Southern merchants sold short in the market, and longs took profits, the market situation turned weak, and as a result, the closing price fell by five or six British pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market continued to soar, rising another eight rupees yesterday along with forecasts. Egyptian cotton also rose by five or sixty British pounds. Liverpool rose by over twenty pence.

There has been no progress in the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai in recent days. Chinese factories have stopped operating for many days, and the industry is very quiet. However, Japanese manufacturers have recently had small-scale spot transactions, all of which are lower-grade American cotton, all of which are shipped in December. The factory price including tax converted from the American exchange rate of 8.5 yuan is as follows:

20-count Good Middling American 166.40

And Same grade lower 160.20

32-count Same 172.55

And Same grade lower 164.85

42-count Same 175.65

And Same grade lower 166.40

### Grains: Foreign Rice Already Being Sold; Japonica and Indica Rice Damp and Being Sold Off

Yesterday, each merchant's source arrived with a total of thirty-six or seven cars of goods from Su Jia Kun Tai Feng Qing, etc., with a number of nearly five thousand packages. The continuous rain has caused a large number of goods to be waterlogged on the way. This kind of waterlogged goods is most prone to change and cannot be left unattended, so general merchants are eager to sell in order to avoid losses, and the source is crowded. The market has been exhausted, and hoarding households are selling out one after another after making profits. In such an environment, the minds of both buyers and sellers are discouraged. Early in the morning, the situation was soft, and the general waterlogged goods were sold off at a low price of one yuan. Afterwards, the stores in this town became even more indifferent, and the prices of each cargo fell step by step under mutual competition. As a result, whether it was Japonica rice or Yin Bian Yuan, the market price was shortened by one or two yuan compared to the previous price. Chang Jian Te Japonica was 35 yuan, Su Kun white Japonica was 32 to 33 yuan, middle and second grade was 30 to 29 yuan, Qing Jiao Bo Dao Te was 31 yuan, ordinary ones were about 30 yuan, Jia Bo Dao was 29 yuan and 50 cents to 29 yuan, Lu Yang Jian was 31 to 32 yuan, Jing Jian was 31 yuan to 29 and a half yuan, Chen Xin Bian Yuan was 33 to 34 yuan, Yin Yuan was 31 to 32 yuan, and the total sales were only four or five thousand packages. Looking back at the rice market, since the continuous decline in prices, the current market price of special goods has fallen by about five yuan compared with the previous high price, and the price of Zhong Guan goods and customer tip has fallen by about seven yuan. In short, this wave of price increases was entirely caused by the manipulation of speculators, and its foundation was originally floating. Now that this situation has been formed, it seems difficult to change in a short period of time, because since each inland area heard about the Shanghai market's skyrocketing prices, the markets in the two places have merged, and profits can be made by transporting goods out of the country. Large amounts of foreign rice will also arrive in Shanghai in the shortest possible period of time. At that time, the stacks will be full and the people will have no need to hoard food. How can these speculators continue to use their magic to cause trouble? It is hoped that rice prices will gradually fall back to normal, and we can rejoice!

Yesterday, scattered heads of customer Indica rice arrived and continued to be sold, and the sellers and large profit-making households were eager to sell. Since the arrival of green rice from the country has been booming for days, and foreign rice has continued to be ordered, people's minds have been weak. Yesterday, in addition to a large number of damp rice being sold off at a discount, foreign rice arrived, and the situation became even weaker. The market opened with a downward trend, and was smaller than the previous market by one yuan. Gao Ke Indica was only 31 and a half yuan, and the middle and second grade was as low as about 30 yuan. The buyers were watching, and the total sales were only over a thousand packages.

Affected by the continued decline in Japonica and Indica rice, the new transactions of foreign rice were silent. However, the grain merchants originally planned to transport 30,000 packages from Hong Kong, which have been loaded and transported by Wo Sang and Ming Sang. Yesterday, the first batch of more than 2,000 packages was opened, which was No. 1 round long grain and No. 2 rice. It is said to be An Nam Japonica rice. The new arrival of foreign rice is quite popular in the shop. The price of the original package of 198 catties was discussed at 40 yuan the night before, but yesterday it has dropped to 38 yuan, and 160 catties are sold at 33 yuan for long grain and 32 yuan for round grain. The No. 2 is 31 yuan.

### Oil Market: New Prices for Soybean Oil Reach Peak After Peak

Yesterday, the soybean oil market was still extremely hot. The bull companies still had no intention of selling, and the source was intermittent. The market price rose by another two or three yuan. At the moment, the overall situation is completely controlled by the manipulators, so new high prices are emerging one after another. The general traders are still blindly dragging in. Yesterday, it was estimated that 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 58 yuan and 50 cents, 50 pieces of Yan Qi oil at a price of 62 yuan, 20 barrels of Qingdao oil at a price of 82 yuan, and 10 barrels of Tianjin oil at a price of 81 yuan. Peanut oil was constrained by soybean oil. The Hong Kong merchants had already inspected it yesterday, and only the merchants had a way out. The market price rose by another one or two yuan. It is estimated that 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 62 yuan and 50 cents, 30 barrels of Jiangbei barrel oil at a price of 78 yuan and 50 cents, and 500 cans of canned oil, with prices rising from 79 yuan and 70 cents to 80 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Chaoqing Continues to Tighten

Yesterday, the sugar market was more firm due to the tightening of foreign exchange. The Shanghai Sugar Exchange quoted spot prices of 24 rough white sugar at 51.5 yuan for the local warehouse and 52 to 52.5 yuan for the foreign warehouse. The price for transit goods was 41.5 yuan. The Tai Gu Che brand white B mark East Machine was 55 yuan, the West Warehouse was 55.5 yuan, the brand W was 55 yuan, CX was 54 yuan, DY was 53 yuan, HX mark was 52.5 yuan, and HC was 39 yuan. Dutch red sugar was 41 to 41.5 yuan. The Zhen Ji brand No. 1 white sugar was 52 yuan, the No. 1 ice sugar was 62.5 yuan, and the Jing Ming ice sugar was 64.5 yuan, all up by half a yuan. The domestic sugar was quite firm due to the lack of spot goods. Huanggang Qing was slightly tighter, with over 300 bags traded at 36.2 to 36 yuan. Ordinary Huizhou white sugar was 51 yuan, and high Hainan red sugar was 32.5 yuan, with a total of hundreds of bags traded. Today, 750 bags of rice and sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea: The Silk Market Can Be Expected to Be Active

Yesterday's silk market: Yokohama was closed for holidays, New York spot prices were unchanged, near-term prices rose by 1.5 cents, and far-term prices rose by 2 cents. The general market situation is gradually developing in a stable manner. The local silk market, white factory 78 points market price was 4150 yuan. Yesterday, the original market was still open. Ha He Ren Ji, Da Chang and other foreign firms jointly purchased 210 piculs. If the exchange rate is favorable to export trade, then the local silk market will be active again. However, in the current situation, it only shortens the distance between domestic and foreign silk prices. Observing yesterday's local silk market, people's minds were quite stable, and the general elites had no harsh demands on silk prices. Therefore, the silk market can be expected to be more active than last week.

Spring and Autumn

### Returning from the Sino-Western Flower Show

— Lu Qing

Yesterday, I braved the rain to visit the autumn flower show held by the Sino-Western Flower Society at the Racecourse. Upon entering the second gate, I saw rows of large, lush chrysanthemums lining the walkway, creating a path of flowers. In the first hall on the right, a beautiful scene unfolded before me. Along the wall on the right side, the Shanghai Municipal Council's parks displayed chrysanthemums arranged as a chrysanthemum mountain.

In the center, occupying the largest area, were many large and small dining tables, all decorated by Western ladies. There were flower arrangements, knives, plates... One table used all kinds of splendid silverware and was the most luxurious, but it only won third prize. Another table was very simple, covered with a light green tablecloth, with light green candles, and a large pile of vegetables in the middle. The colors were very harmonious, and the arrangement was simple and natural, winning first prize. In the very center, I found a mahogany round table with a Chinese banquet on it. Looking at the Western name on the colorful prize certificate, I realized that the exhibitor was the cultured Mr. Zhou Shoujuan. In the center was a tall flower arrangement made of a tree root carved into pine and cranes, with a poem by Zhu Sanyou and another poem by Songshishanren of the Qianlong era inscribed on it. Many drooping red Phoenix Tail chrysanthemums were inserted into this flower arrangement, and a lingzhi mushroom stood tall on the side. On that side was also a pair of bronze crane candlesticks with two red candles, creating a solemn atmosphere. Around the table were small square and round lacquer trays with mother-of-pearl inlay of figures, which were certainly exquisite. All the carved ivory chopsticks and porcelain bowls with tin rims, and the green-ground five-color wine cups were old Qianlong-Jiaqing items. To the left of each set of cups and chopsticks stood name cards of Ye Yuhu, Wu Daiqiu, Fan Shaoyun, Zhao Ziyun, etc., each painted with a plum blossom. This table was antique and elegant, a credit to the Chinese.

In front of this Chinese-style dining table were three large tables. The middle one had five pieces, including two pots of rocks and water, which resembled landscapes in paintings, very natural. Behind it, on a high flower stand, was a large tripod bronze incense burner. Next to a large stone bamboo shoot was a large hooked yellow chrysanthemum, arranged in a semi-cliff shape, also full of artistic sense. On the left side table was a ten-scene cabinet, containing twenty pieces of small potted plants and statues of Bodhidharma from Beifeng Lingbi, exquisite and small, bizarre and colorful. On top was a half-drooping pine in a pot, with a Bodhidharma statue sitting under the pine, like an ancient painting. Next to the cabinet was a lion-mane yellow chrysanthemum, paired with Ying stone and lingzhi, with the flower positions well-arranged and several bamboo fences inserted, clearly representing the remnants of chrysanthemums by the eastern fence. On the right side table was a short table with a pot of wintergreen with hanging roots and a small bronze statue of Sakyamuni in the center. In front of it was a shallow pot made of Han Dynasty bricks, arranged with a forest of tiger thorn, with red berries in clusters, bright and vibrant. Next to these three tables was a large silver cup, probably the prize. Several Western men and women were crowded around the table, asking a Chinese man in a Zhongshan suit questions. They were calling him Mr. Chow. Then I suddenly realized that this was the exhibitor, Mr. Zhou Shoujuan. I originally wanted to get to know him, so I waited for the Western men and women to leave, then shyly went up to introduce myself and asked him about everything. Mr. Zhou answered very politely, saying that he participated in the competition in both spring and autumn, firstly because he had been interested in potted plants for ten years, and secondly because Westerners have always looked down on Chinese gardening, so he wanted to win back some face. This time, he actually won the highest prize of the entire show - the large silver cup of Sir Peter Greay, like the Davis Cup of the international tennis tournament, which can be kept for half a year, and returned to the show in the spring flower show next year, when the show will engrave his name on it and give him a smaller silver cup, which can be kept permanently. I remember that Mr. Zhou said a thought-provoking sentence in the conversation: "I hope that everyone in the world becomes a flower lover, so that everyone is happy and peaceful, and perhaps there will be no more wars." This sentence is worth pondering. I lingered here for a full hour before thanking him and leaving. Outside, I also saw a table displayed by Mr. Kong Zhiqing, which was also full of antiquity, and had the same effect as Mr. Zhou's.

Back home, I had a dream that night - a flower-like dream.

### The Problem of Discipline for Elementary School Students

— Fallen Leaf

I have been an elementary school teacher for several years, but I have doubts about my own eight-year-old child's "schooling problem." Because I am too familiar with the "inside story" of elementary schools in this metropolis, when school started this autumn, I hesitated again: "Should I send her to school again?" I really wanted to educate her myself. However, because "family education" is too monotonous, no matter how dubious I am about elementary school education in this metropolis, I still believe that "school education" with its collective life is suitable for children's nature. So I sent my daughter to a relatively large elementary school again.

In less than two months, this eight-year-old girl has left me with two very profound impressions. I feel that "the problem of discipline for elementary school students" is worth discussing with all elementary schools in Shanghai.

The first impression I got was: I remember one day, when my child came home for lunch, she was not as talkative and happy as usual. She was just listless, with some heavy thoughts on her mind. I was very strange, so I asked her what was making her unhappy. She replied slowly: "Dad! Today, in our class, a classmate was hit on the palm of her hand by the teacher more than a dozen times, crying as loud as firecrackers! Dad, I'm really scared. This teacher often hits people when he's unhappy!" What made this child still look dazed and worried was the sound of the elementary school student being hit crying as loud as "firecrackers" which shocked her whole mind. I fully understand the painful situation of elementary school teachers now. "Often being unhappy" is the distress of elementary school teachers. However, it is very big to affect the elementary school students themselves with one's own joys, sorrows, and happiness. Here, I hope that elementary school teachers who are "often unhappy" will please not vent their "complaints" on innocent and innocent children.

The first impression I got was: One day, after my child came home for lunch and finished eating, she asked her mother to put some powder on her little face, preferably some rouge. I was very surprised to hear that. Although everyone has a love of beauty, my little girl is only eight years old. Sometimes, if she gets a little cold, her snot will still hang out. What's more, her pursuit of beauty is so "vulgar" that she wants to apply powder and rouge? This really puzzled me. I asked her, and she said: "The teachers in our school always like female students who wear powder and rouge, so I want to be like that too." Hearing this, I was both surprised and angry. I really wanted to not send my little girl to school anymore, or write a letter to the school to scold them severely. But then I thought: such things may be very common, why not write an article and submit it to the newspaper, to arouse the attention of all elementary schools in Shanghai to this kind of indiscretion of elementary school teachers in their behavior, thus affecting the pure psychology of elementary school students. In this extraordinary period, elementary schools should thoroughly think about and arrange "the problem of discipline for elementary school students". This will not only greatly help our next generation, but also the establishment of our future new country. The purpose of writing this article is also here.

Chapter 18: Discussing Economic Prosperity and Old City; Describing Marriage Plunder and Tracing Back the Legacy

At this time, Wu Junzi helped Zhu Airen arrange her car, because she had driven her car back to Suzhou after returning from Shanghai. They indeed hired a large car, fortunately they didn't have much luggage, at most each carried a small suitcase. So the five of them sat in the car, still very comfortable. Shao Huihua also came out of the dormitory with them, watched them all get into the car, and then straddled her motorcycle, smiled back at Wu Junsu and others, and said: "I'll wait for you at the train station!" Seeing her leather shoes lightly exerting force, the motorcycle seemed like a wisp of light smoke, flying forward. At first, the car chased behind, still visible, but after a while it disappeared. Because Shao Huihua's motorcycle was the latest American model, it made no noise when it was running. Unlike the previous motorcycles, the noise was the loudest and most terrifying. When their car arrived at the train station, Shao Huihua was already there, and had already handed her motorcycle over to the luggage car manager. But the train hadn't arrived yet, because this train was called the Liaohu Through Train. Why is it called the Liaohu Through Train? It's the train that runs all the way from Liaoning to Shanghai. This can be considered a main road from north to south in China. Liaoning used to be called Fengtian, because in the past, when the Chinese capital was in Beijing, there was also a train that ran to Beijing, and that road was called the Beining Railway. Later, Beijing was renamed Beiping, although the trains between Pingjin still traveled frequently. But there was also a train that came in from outside the pass to Tianjin every day, and then connected to the Jinghu Road from the Jinpu Road, and ran straight to Shanghai, which was this train. Wu Junsu looked at her own watch and said, "It's almost here! Five minutes to go, let's go to the platform to wait." It turns out that the time of Chinese trains is now very accurate. It says it will arrive at the station at a certain point, a certain ten minutes and a certain minutes, it will definitely arrive on time. Because the train timetable is like a formulated law. Lateness is indeed not allowed, and early arrival is also inconvenient. Some people say: lateness is indeed not good, passengers keep the time and come to the station. But what about the car? Left waiting does not come, right waiting does not come, missing the time, making the things that passengers have to do by keeping the time unable to be done, isn't that a waste of time? Wouldn't it be better to arrive early? I arrive at the station in advance, and the train is already parked at the station, isn't that better? But now China's railways are not all double-tracked. In many places, there are regulations for crossing cars and letting cars, etc. Otherwise, wouldn't it be chaotic. (206)

### George Bernard Shaw Urges Establishment of Soldiers' Theaters

— Xin Liang

According to a Reuter's report from London on the 11th, the humorous master George Bernard Shaw recently sent a letter to the Times urging the speedy opening of London theaters, etc.

Currently, although two-thirds of the 4,000 cinemas in the UK have reopened, most of the theaters in London that stage stage plays have not yet resumed business. British Labor Minister Brown, along with representatives selected from the Actors' Association, the Musicians' Union, the Artists' Union, the National Theater Employees' Society, and other groups, also jointly submitted a document to the authorities, requesting the opening of London theaters as soon as possible.

The document pointed out that unless all the theaters in London and other major cities are reopened, thousands upon thousands of people who depend on theaters for a living will immediately suffer tragic unemployment.

In his open letter, Shaw also frankly told us: During the last European war, we had 8,000 soldiers going to the theater every night in London to enjoy the performances on the screen. The general situation at that time was really quite enthusiastic. But now, we haven't even seen one "soldiers' theater."

"Therefore, the authorities should immediately open the current theaters and build new ones specifically for the soldiers. Every actor and film industry personnel, unless they have more important duties, should not be allowed to stop working!" Shaw earnestly hoped in his letter.

(Editor's note: In view of the fact that Chinese soldiers indeed do not have much entertainment enjoyment, I think that this kind of theater specifically established for soldiers is also urgently needed in China at present.

Jiang Juncao's lofty aspirations: Jiang Juncao and his wife Bai Lu live next door to a guest who is an aircraft repair engineer at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport. Every time there is a new aircraft or after an aircraft is repaired, they are invited to ride. They have been airborne many times. On the 14th of this month, they again test-flew a newly arrived large aircraft, which can carry more than 20 people and is intended to operate on the Hong Kong-Chongqing route. The Jiangs learned of this news and, with the engineer's consent, specially invited Wang Naidong, Peng Fei, and others to ride together. Wang and others had never been on an airplane before, and were all very interested to be able to ride. Jiang Juncao has a great interest in engaging in aviation, and his physique already meets the standards.

Ancient costume films are popular in Hong Kong: Mandarin ancient costume films are box office hits in Hong Kong, mostly booming. Cantonese film merchants are envious and are also shooting "Yue Fei," "Yang Guifei," and "Empress Dowager Cixi." However, Cantonese films mostly cut corners, and the talent is declining, making it difficult to compete with Mandarin ancient costume films. Even in the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines, Mandarin films are valued more than Cantonese films. If Mandarin films can do well, then there is no fear that Cantonese films will not be defeated.

Cai Chusheng hired by Nanyang: The Dadi Film Company moved to Kunming to work. Some of the original staff were willing to go, while others did not. Cai Chusheng, the director of "Island Paradise," had originally decided to go, but is now staying in Hong Kong. When Cai directed "Island Paradise," in addition to a monthly living expense of 50 yuan, he also had a director's fee of 1,000 yuan, a generous treatment. In principle, he should still work for Dadi, but the Nanyang Company here (that is, the Hong Kong factory of Tianyi Company) recently has a plan to also shoot Mandarin films and is willing to pay 1,000 Hong Kong dollars to ask Cai to write and direct a film, so Cai is in a dilemma.

### Tan Xiaosheng Zhou Weijun

— Yun

Zhou Weijun, a rising star of Xiaosheng who was hired by Genxin for the first time in Shanghai, has been praised by the people of Shanghai since his performance. The actor is handsome and unrestrained, especially good at singing, and has a good foundation in martial arts. Weijun is proficient in both civil and military roles, and can be called a versatile talent. According to Weijun's unique talent, he is known as the Iron Throat. In the old capital, he and Ye ShengLan Yu Zhenfei were known as the two outstanding Xiaosheng. This time, he made a stunning appearance in Shanghai. Unfortunately, the performance period is very short, and he will soon return north with glory.

### Silver Screen News

Chen Yunshang's fourth blockbuster, "Fei Zhen'e Assassinating the Tiger," has now started filming. Chen plays the concubine Fei, Xu Huayuan plays Li Hu, and Shan Li Pingqian directs. The work is very tense, and it is planned to be released in the new year.

The historical costume films "Loyalty to the Country," which tells the life of Yue Fei, and "Loyalty and Righteousness Forever," which tells the life of Guan Gong, are being rushed to film. "Loyalty to the Country" is directed by Wu Yonggang, with Liu Qiong as the protagonist, and "Loyalty and Righteousness Forever" is directed by Yue Feng, with Wang Yuanlong as the protagonist.

"Legend of the White Snake" was adapted by Chen Dabei and Yang Xiaozhong, removing its mythology and retaining its essence. It describes the darkness of feudal society incisively. Chen Yanyan plays the White Lady, Tong Yuejuan plays Xiaoqing, and Sun Min plays Xu Xian. It has now been completed and will be released in the near future.

### The Modern Woman Warrior "Wang Baochuan"

— Gu Fen

Among the many popular unofficial historical romances, "Wang Baochuan" is the most worthy of attention. It not only occupies every corner of cities, villages, and even remote borderlands, but also, through the introduction of playwright Xiong Shi-i, it has brought to overseas audiences the image of the first brave woman in traditional feudal society who raised an iron spear to break through the barriers of old ethical teachings. In the past, it was rare, or even non-existent, for Chinese drama to gain international acclaim, but "Wang Baochuan" planted the first seed.

The "Wang Baochuan" in the movie is even more idealized. She becomes a successful woman resisting the war. When the enemy's iron hooves cross the border of her motherland, she does not hesitate to shout the slogan of defending the motherland. She is a hero, a warrior, standing at the forefront of national thought. The belief in certain victory for eighteen years is established in her consciousness like an iron pillar. Finally, the warriors return with smiles, and the era of final victory is finally realized.

Both North and South Have a Figure of Worship

(1) When he was serving in the inner court, a certain actor, due to illness and lack of strength, looked unsightly. While he was performing a certain play on stage, the Empress Dowager suddenly said to those around her, "Why does today's De Bao look like a jinx?" Later, Rui Ling heard about this and was greatly worried. He often said to people, "The Old Buddha's words are golden and jade. The last time she rewarded me with cherries, she saw me so scared that I swallowed the pits, and she said I was a silly boy. This time she said I was a jinx, so from now on I am doomed." Strangely enough, since Old Rui left Beijing, he has performed in Jinan, Xuzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places, but he has never been very successful in the past twenty years. Someone asked him why he was so down and out, and he replied very cleverly, "She said I was an imperial jinx, so don't even think about becoming popular again in this lifetime." (2) His wife passed away very early, and he lost his wife in middle age, leaving behind two sons and a daughter. He had to sing opera and take care of his children. He wrote all his grievances on yellow paper, burned it with fire, and prayed to heaven. Someone asked him what he meant, and he said, "I have a belly full of grievances that are difficult to tell in the human world, so I specially wrote this to present my grievances to the Jade Emperor." More than ten years ago, he came to Shanghai and rented a room in a small alley east of the Empire. The house was very small and the stairs were narrow. Coincidentally, his eldest son, Feng Qi, suffered from severe lung disease, already in the third stage. The landlord was so frightened that he urged him to move out every day. At that time, he had no money to move, and he hired a small doctor to see him. At that time, I was saddened and, regardless of the danger of lung disease transmission, I gave up a pavilion room for his dying son to recover. Who would have thought that Feng Qi would die in seven days! (148)
