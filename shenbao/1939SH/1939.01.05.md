### Japan Feels Increasingly Uneasy Domestically - Konoe Cabinet Suddenly Collapses - Fascist Leader Hiranuma Kiichirō Organizes New Cabinet - Stock Exchange Prices Plummet After New Year Opening

(Tokyo) Prime Minister Konoe convened a cabinet meeting at 10:30 this morning. After the meeting, he entered the Imperial Palace at 11:30 to submit the cabinet's resignation to the Emperor. Chief Cabinet Secretary Akira Kazami also formally announced the news. (Reuters, 4th)

(Tokyo) Hiranuma, having been ordered to form a cabinet, requested a period of consideration and then left the palace to begin the task. He appointed Tanabe as Chief Cabinet Secretary and invited Kazuo Ishiwata, a senior official from the Ministry of Finance, to serve as Minister of Finance. (Reuters, 4th)

(Tokyo) The latest predictions for new cabinet members are: Arita as Foreign Minister, Kido as Home Minister, Ishiwata as Finance Minister, Itagaki as Army Minister, Yonai as Navy Minister, Shiono as Justice Minister, Araki as Education Minister, and Hatta as Colonial Affairs Minister. The ministerial posts for Communications, Railways, Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry, and Welfare will be distributed among important politicians. Seiyukai party leader Machida and Minseitō party leader Maeda, among others, are expected to join the cabinet. (Reuters, 5th)

(Tokyo) At 9:42 PM tonight, Privy Council President Hiranuma was summoned to the Imperial Palace and ordered to form a cabinet. Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō, age 73, has served on the Privy Council for ten years. He previously served as a judicial official in the Saionji Cabinet and as Minister of Justice in 1933. In recent years, whenever there has been talk of a change in government, Hiranuma has been mentioned as a possible successor to the prime ministership. After the Emperor accepted Konoe's resignation, he summoned Minister of the Imperial Household Yasakira Taira to seek his opinion on potential successors. Yasakira requested to consult with elder statesman Saionji before reporting back. He then took a train to Yanatsu and is expected to return to Kyoto tonight at 9:00 PM to report. According to predictions from the Asahi Shimbun, if Hiranuma is ordered to form a cabinet, Konoe will become President of the Privy Council and a Minister without Portfolio. Incumbent cabinet members expected to remain are Army Minister Itagaki, Navy Minister Yonai, Foreign Minister Arita, and Welfare Minister Kido. Those expected to resign are Finance Minister Ikeda, Home Minister (undecided), Agriculture Minister Arima, Communications Minister Nagai, and Railways Minister Nakajima. The positions of Education Minister Araki and Colonial Affairs Minister Hatta are uncertain. Hiranuma's cabinet will invite the Minseitō and Seiyukai parties to join. Former Privy Councilor of the "Manchukuo" government, Tanabe, will become a cabinet member or Chief Cabinet Secretary. After the New Year holiday, the stock market reopened this morning. Due to Konoe's resignation, prices plummeted. When Konoe entered the Imperial Palace this morning, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazami officially announced the cabinet's resignation. Konoe then released a statement after his resignation, stating that in June 1937, when he first took office, the China Incident broke out and has since become increasingly serious, leading to a complex situation both domestically and internationally. Now that the China Incident has entered a new phase, it is time for the Japanese government to focus its efforts on creating a new order to maintain peace in East Asia. He believes that it is necessary for the new cabinet to formulate new policies to increase public trust. As for the Japanese government's unshakable fundamental policy on the China Incident, it has already been established and approved by the Emperor. He fears that his abilities are not up to the task and has therefore submitted his cabinet's resignation. (Reuters, 4th)

(Tokyo) The army and navy here believe that in order to cope with the crisis in China, it is necessary to establish a centralized government. The Konoe Cabinet, under pressure from the army and navy, has decided to resign en masse today. Well-informed sources believe that this is not unexpected. Fascist sympathizers within Japan, such as the undecided Home Minister, are prepared to dissolve the Diet and merge all domestic political parties into one to create a simple, centralized rule. According to observers here, Konoe Cabinet's decision to resign comes at Japan's most critical juncture in history, as Japan's relationship with China and third countries continues to deteriorate, especially with the United Kingdom and the United States. External relations are not expected to improve. In addition to diplomatic relations, there are many serious problems that need to be resolved by the new government. (Associated Press, 4th)

### China's Determination to Resist Remains Strong, Unaffected by Japanese Political Turmoil - Konoe and Wang Jingwei's Secret Negotiations Fail - Japanese Domination Will Be Increasingly Controlled by Warlords

(Chongqing) A Chinese spokesperson stated today at a press conference that the resignation of the Japanese cabinet is tantamount to a public admission of the failure of the war in China over the past eighteen months, and that it also shows the dominance of radicals who believe that Japan must place the entire nation on a full war footing in order to continue fighting. Their fundamental policy towards China will hardly change. On the contrary, they will intensify their military operations. In terms of diplomacy, Japan will make further attempts to consolidate an anti-communist bloc and will have even less regard for the rights of third countries. As far as China is concerned, the change in the Japanese cabinet will have little impact, as China is fully prepared to continue its resistance. Since Japan is being controlled by new radicals, the day of Japan's collapse is drawing closer. (Reuters, 4th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources here, Prime Minister Konoe's resignation was due to the following reasons: (1) Konoe's speech on December 22 failed to produce the results he expected, so he resigned to take responsibility. (2) Japanese political parties fought hard for their own existence. It is generally expected that right-wing elements will dominate the Japanese press to intensify the war against China and close the door to peace talks. It is rumored that Konoe, as a result of secret negotiations with Wang Jingwei, issued a peace speech on December 22, hoping that China would respond under Wang Jingwei's instigation. Even if Wang Jingwei could not obtain the full agreement of the government, it was anticipated that the Chinese government could be seriously divided, thereby promoting the path to reconciliation. Unexpectedly, Wang Jingwei's attempt was isolated and weak, and the Chinese government adopted swift and resolute measures. The whole country unanimously supported Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to continue the war of resistance. Konoe and Wang Jingwei's peace movement completely failed, leading to serious condemnation. At the same time, the proposal to merge all political parties into one would completely eliminate the Seiyukai and Minseitō parties. Although these two parties have given up everything to the military in the past few years, they cannot make a final struggle when their survival is threatened. In the future, the new Japanese cabinet will definitely have full fascist characteristics, and all its powers will be controlled by warlords. (Reuters, 4th)

(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun stated that the main reason for Konoe's resignation was the failure of the movement to organize a unified political party and implement the national mobilization plan. After Foreign Minister Ugaki submitted his resignation last September, Konoe had already decided to resign, but was ultimately forced by circumstances to continue in office. When the movement to unify political parties and implement the National General Mobilization Law, to which the Prime Minister paid close attention, failed, he decided to leave. However, Japan's policy towards China will not change due to the cabinet reshuffle. On the contrary, its policy towards China will be more active than before. (Dispatch, 4th)

(Tokyo) The Nichi-Nichi Shimbun stated that Hiranuma has always believed in nationalism. If he were to form a cabinet during a time of peace and the rise of liberalism, all sectors would be shocked. Now that Japan is at war and economic controls have been strengthened, some believe that the new cabinet will not make drastic changes to Japan's economic structure. (Dispatch, 4th)

(Paris) The resignation of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet has been commented on by observers here as follows: The war between China and Japan has become more difficult to end, and the confrontational situation between the United States and Japan has intensified. People generally believed that the Sino-Japanese war was moving towards compromise. Konoe's China policy announced on December 22 last year, although severely criticized by the French side as unacceptable, after Wang Jingwei sent a telegram to General Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Chinese Military Commission, on the 29th of that month, it was believed here that some Chinese leaders were willing to conduct peace negotiations with Japan. At the same time, it was also believed that Japan, due to many domestic difficulties, should adopt a compromising attitude towards the Chinese government. Unexpectedly, strong hardliners in Tokyo, fearing that China and Japan would reach a compromise, forced the Konoe Cabinet to collapse. The Chinese side unanimously condemned Wang Jingwei's peace telegram. Based on this, the Japanese cabinet reshuffle will certainly not help peace in the Far East. On the contrary, the country's ambitions in the Far East will definitely expand further. As for the United States, the government has clearly stated that it can hardly accept Konoe's proposal to establish a new order in East Asia. Its opposition to Japan will inevitably become stronger. U.S. President Roosevelt will soon submit a message to Congress explaining foreign policy, and its content is of great concern to French observers. (Havas, 4th)

(Berlin) The news of the resignation of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet caused great surprise among German political circles here. Although it was expected that the Konoe Cabinet would not last long, it was unexpected that it would collapse so quickly. As the news was received late, most newspapers did not have time to comment. However, the semi-official German News Agency issued detailed news on the situation of the Japanese political situation. It is generally believed that after Konoe's resignation, his successor will be Privy Council President Hiranuma, in order to strengthen the concentration of national strength and implement "Japan's great plan." In addition, German officials have expressed their views with extreme reservation, only stating that Konoe made a statement after his resignation, emphasizing that Japan must form a new cabinet and implement new policies in order to restore national confidence.

### U.S. Property Bombing Case - Japan Still Trying to Evade Responsibility - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Responds to U.S. Protest, Saying No Responsibility for Lack of Markings

(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement regarding the U.S. note on the bombing of American properties in China, declaring that it is not responsible. The reason given is that the American properties that were bombed did not have formal markings, so it was impossible to identify them as American properties from the air. The Japanese note further stated that several American properties that were destroyed were near legitimate military objectives, so the Japanese government is not responsible for the erroneous bombing of the aforementioned properties by Japanese pilots. In short, the Japanese note refuses to take responsibility for the bombing of thirteen American properties in China by Japanese aircraft. This note is a response to the protest submitted by the United States on December 29. Observers here believe that U.S.-Japan relations are about to reach a critical stage. (Associated Press, 4th)

### All Parties Still Hope He Awakens - Final Advice to Wang - Central Government is Lenient and Has Not Issued an Arrest Warrant - Turning Back is the Right Path, Do Not Leave Behind National Disgrace - It is Internally Determined that Sun Lian Will Succeed as Vice President - No Arrests of Political Prisoners in Chongqing

(Hong Kong) Fallen Dispatch: A certain important person said that the central government has not immediately issued an arrest warrant for Wang Jingwei, which is a sign of leniency. Many people who have a deep personal friendship with Wang are still performing their duties as usual and are expressing anger at Wang's actions. They hope that he will go to Europe to rest and recover, to seek forgiveness from the people. Many people, including so-and-so, have sent telegrams to Wang in their personal capacities, offering final advice, hoping that he will no longer act recklessly and bring shame to the nation. The generals have sent telegrams in support of the central government's handling of Wang. It is internally determined that Sun Ke will be the Vice President. (Special Dispatch, 5th, 1:00 AM)

(Hong Kong) Shao Lizi said that the central government will have further expressions regarding Wang Jingwei, depending on how he acts in the future. The central government's handling of Wang's case is strict and lenient. There are many friends of Wang in the central government who are still performing their duties as usual. (Special Dispatch, 4th, 6:00 PM)

(Hong Kong) It is rumored that Wang Jingwei is very frustrated about being expelled from the party. He is now trying to ease the atmosphere of opposition and plans to sacrifice a certain Chen and a certain Lin, and have Gu Mengyu issue a public statement. I believe that the telegram on the 29th was Wang's original intention, but it was actually Chen and Lin who acted on their own authority. Wang will issue a second statement, the content of which will still express support for peace. (Special Dispatch, 4th, 11:00 PM)

(Hong Kong) Senators staying in Hong Kong are very angry at Wang Jingwei's actions. Zhang Yi said that he plans to invite the senators to hold a meeting once a week to exchange opinions. The third Senate meeting was originally scheduled to be held in Chongqing this month, but now that the Speaker has left, the central government is considering a successor. The meeting may be postponed to February. (Special Dispatch, 4th, 11:00 PM)

(Changsha) All sectors in Hunan were extremely indignant upon hearing the news of Wang's advocacy of peace. They convened a meeting on the 4th to plan a rally to support the war of resistance and punish Wang for his treachery. (Dispatch, 4th)

Kunming: Since the Wang case occurred, public sentiment has been outraged. The Yunnan Provincial Steering Committee, the Anti-Japanese Association, and other organizations sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang on the 4th, expressing their respects and supporting the central government's resolution to remove Wang from the party and dismiss him from his post. (Dispatch, 4th)

(Hong Kong) Where is Wang Jingwei? Various rumors are circulating here, but it seems that the report received by the Japanese side from Hanoi is more credible. The report stated that Wang and five others are currently in the suburbs of Hanoi. Because Wang has been expelled from the party by the Central Executive Committee, he is not convenient to have any contact with the Chinese Consulate General in Hanoi. It is rumored that Zhou Fohai is also with Wang in Hanoi. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

(Chongqing) According to reliable sources, the National Government considers the Wang Jingwei incident to be over. In the event that Wang begins negotiations with Japan, the National Government will punish Wang and his followers. There are currently no plans to make further statements. The rumor that 200 of Wang's followers were arrested in Chongqing is completely unfounded and has been refuted by the authorities. (Haitong Dispatch, 4th)

(Hong Kong) According to late news from Hanoi received by related parties, Wang Jingwei was still in a hospital in Hanoi as of the evening of the 2nd of this month. Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai and others have flown to Hanoi from Kunming on a special plane, but the purpose is unknown. However, according to general speculation, Du and others are going there to persuade Wang Jingwei to abandon his "peace" intentions and continue to support the central government. (Express News Agency, 4th)

(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, Wang Jingwei held a meeting with Itagaki and senior Japanese military officers here yesterday to discuss the reorganization of the puppet organizations in Peiping and Nanjing. It is rumored that Wang will take office as the puppet "President", Wu Peifu will serve as the puppet "Chairman of the Military Commission", and Jin Yunpeng will serve as the puppet "Prime Minister". In recent days, there has been a lot of communication between Peiping and Wang. (Express News Agency, 4th)

(Chongqing) According to predictions from Chinese sources here, the position of Vice President of the Kuomintang, which Wang Jingwei left vacant after his escape, may remain vacant. According to the original proposal passed by the National Kuomintang Temporary Congress in Hankou last year, only Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was elected as President, and there was no mention of a Vice President. Later, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally recommended Wang Jingwei, and he was then elected to the position. However, there were many who opposed it at the time. (Reuters, 4th)

(Chongqing) A Chinese spokesperson, in response to questions from reporters at a press conference, stated that no political prisoners had been arrested in the past week.

Editorial

### The Resignation of the Japanese Cabinet

The news of the resignation of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet was slightly heard at the beginning of this year, but unexpectedly, when Konoe convened the first cabinet meeting of this year on January 4th yesterday, he had already decided on the total resignation of the cabinet and immediately asked the Japanese Emperor for approval. In China, when Wang Jingwei, who was acting as an echo of "Konoe's Peace," was severely reprimanded by the people of the whole country, his "Konoe's Peace" mechanism collapsed at the same time. This is particularly worthy of our attention.

Since Konoe formed his cabinet in June of the year before last, the war against China immediately broke out. The Japanese warlords used large-scale military offensive means to try to destroy China in one fell swoop, while Konoe often released clever "peace" arguments, using political conspiracies to cover up their aggressive traces with a gesture of relaxation in the international arena. He was naturally a powerful pillar of the Japanese wartime cabinet, but why is this pillar now collapsing itself? According to Konoe's own declaration, the reason for the cabinet's resignation is that "the current incident has entered a new situation and reached a period where all efforts should be devoted to building a new order, and the current cabinet is afraid that it will not be able to cope," so it is necessary to resign. This statement is of course a respectable excuse, but it is not difficult for us to speculate on the internal truth from various aspects.

First, we can assert that the inability of the Konoe Cabinet to sustain itself is due to the pressure of internal fascist warlord forces. As a result of the eighteen-month war against China by the Japanese warlords, the people have been impoverished and their wealth exhausted, and there is still no solution to the military situation. Naturally, they can only increase their power even more frantically. This requires more military spending and greater military control power. However, the former will inevitably lead to a panic in Japanese finance, while the latter will inevitably subject the lives of all Japanese people and the activities of all public and private organizations to stricter intervention by the military. Even the Japanese political parties themselves must be dominated by fascist warlords as much as possible. So how can the Konoe Cabinet itself cope with this new situation? Therefore, reports that the cause of the cabinet upheaval is related to the "political national mobilization" advocated by Interior Minister Makida, who has a deep fascist tendency, shows that the Japanese warlords' anxiety over the war against China has first caused a new change in domestic politics.

Second, in terms of the international situation, the increasingly unfavorable situation for Japan has become increasingly evident, which is also enough to make Konoe's "double reed policy," which he has always played with the Japanese warlords, go unheeded in the future. Recently, the large loans from Britain and the United States to China, as well as the economic sanctions against Japan advocated by various countries, all clearly indicate that Japan has caused a very deep reaction in the international community. Moreover, yesterday's new note from the United States to Japan does not recognize Konoe's so-called "new situation" and "new order." This kind of diplomatic pressure is becoming more and more obvious every day, which is naturally enough for the Konoe Cabinet to feel unable to sustain itself and open up a new situation in diplomacy. As far as China is concerned, Konoe's forte is to collude with the wavering elements in China, using "peace" as a cover, as a sugar-coated poison, in an attempt to subdue China without a fight. Unfortunately, Wang Jingwei's call for a peace declaration did not have the "unexpected effect" claimed in the Bai Ling Machine advertisement. On the contrary, the elimination of these wavering elements has further strengthened China's strength in the war of resistance. This is not only a failure of Wang Jingwei's conspiracy, but also a failure of Konoe's political conspiracy. Konoe's performance in international diplomacy is like this. If he does not resign, how can he develop a new situation for Japanese fascism?

In the opinion of the Japanese army and navy, since a weak cabinet like Konoe's cannot cope with the needs of wartime, they naturally hope that a more powerful centralized government can be established in the future, so that the Japanese warlords can do whatever they want. Therefore, the successor cabinet will be doomed to the same fate if it is not a tool of the warlords. However, despite catering to the wishes of the military and disregarding the lifeline of Japan's finances and economy, the tragic fate of Japan's finances and economy will surely come without delay. This can be seen from the recent closures of Japanese enterprises and the increase in unemployed workers, which have already revealed signs. No wonder the news of the resignation of the Japanese cabinet has just been released, and the prices of various stocks on the Japanese stock exchange have fallen sharply. The pessimistic feeling about the future of the war is fully revealed here. The changes in the Japanese political situation are like this, which can greatly increase China's infinite courage in the war of resistance, because everyone can know that even the peace dreams of the Konoe type have also fallen with Konoe's demise. The rise of Japanese fascist arrogance is bound to intensify the attack on China in order to make a final gamble. As long as China perseveres in its resistance, the final victory will be closer and closer!

### Voices from the Highest Academic Institution in England: Oxford University Deans and Professors Send Telegram, Respect Chiang Kai-shek and His Wife, Believe Leadership in the National Resistance Will Accomplish Great Undertakings, The Difference Between Chinese Civilization and Japanese Barbarism is Vast

(London) Several deans and professors from various colleges of Oxford University recently jointly telegraphed General Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of China, saying, "Your Excellency leads your nation's heroic resistance against aggression by those who invade your country and are enemies of your freedom. The deans and professors of our colleges express their utmost respect. Your Excellency and the people of your country are enduring hardships and striving hard, thus accomplishing extraordinary achievements, which are enough to be recorded in history and will not be forgotten by humankind for a long time. In the past, our nation was ignorant and had doubts about the true meaning of Chinese civilization and culture. Today, witnessing the barbaric hatred and narrow-minded nationalism of the Japanese side, which China still treats with a respectful attitude and self-restraint, there is no doubt as to which side represents civilization. Previously, when Your Excellency decided to abandon the city of Hankou, millions of civilians abandoned their homes and followed the resistance army westward. Your Excellency, as the leader of the nation, approved of this. Such a tragic act is something that other countries would not dare to do. Upon hearing this, we were shocked, but considering our traditional spirit and the events experienced by Nanjing and hundreds of other cities in your country, there was no other way to go. We believe that all democratic countries will one day be able to assist your country with a firm and unyielding attitude. The heroic spirit of your nation, even in the enemy country, cannot but elicit admiration in accordance with traditional spirit. Once that day arrives, Your Excellency will surely lead a unified country and prove that your nation is rich in talent and resilience. Even the sincerity of the British nation can be clearly demonstrated. We now express our respect to Your Excellency and Madame Chiang, who share joys and sorrows with you," (Havas News Agency, 3rd)

Oxford: Several deans and professors of Oxford University sent a letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, Madame Soong Mei-ling, who share his hardships, and to the Chinese people, expressing admiration and sympathy. The letter stated, "The Chinese people are now bravely resisting aggression, and Your Excellency is personally leading the fight against those who are trampling on their freedom. We deeply admire this. Your Excellency and the people are able to strengthen themselves unceasingly and, with a spirit of courage and perseverance, build achievements that are incredible. This is a great undertaking worthy of being recorded in history and never forgotten by mankind. We, on the one hand, are taught by the barbaric evil intentions held by those who worship petty nationalism, and on the other hand, are influenced by the noble self-restraint shown by the spirit of the Chinese people resisting Japan. There is no doubt in whose hands the torch of civilization is held." It continued, "We hope that one day in the future, the democrats of the world will stand firmly on your side, and the courage of your people will even win due recognition from the enemy, which they will be forced to give in accordance with their own traditional customs. If that day comes, then Your Excellency will be the leader of a united nation and will be able to prove the innate vitality of your people. Moreover, it will prove the sincerity of the British people, which is what we deeply hope for." The letter was signed by the deans of various colleges of Oxford University and professors of international law, Greek, German philosophy, modern history, economics, moral theology, American history, Chinese philosophy and religion. There are also some important officials who are currently not at the school, but would undoubtedly have signed if they were at the school. (Reuters, 4th)

### Canada and the Philippines Forbid the Shipment of Military Supplies to Japan, The Situation in the British Far East Becomes More Uneasy, Considering Strong Measures to Deal with Japan

(Hong Kong) Tokyo Dispatch: The Director of the East Asia Information Bureau of Japan and Inada of the Army General Staff Headquarters received information that the governments of the Philippines and Canada suddenly secretly ordered various munitions factories to stop selling munitions to Japan from now on. Starting in 1939, all Japanese orders will be rejected, and Japanese munitions purchasing agents will be notified that the government's move is actually the result of persuasion by prominent figures in both the United Kingdom and the United States, along with people in the Philippines, to the government. (3rd)

(London) The news that Japan plans to implement a three-year plan to create a new situation in the Far East has caused extreme anxiety among people in London. Banking and exporting circles are determined to put pressure on Prime Minister Chamberlain to wake up quickly, lest it be too late. Leland, a prominent figure in British business, published a letter in this morning's London Times, strongly stating that China is a good market for the United Kingdom, with the greatest potential for development, and that the United Kingdom must not allow Japan to leave it for its own use. The United Kingdom has invested no less than 300 million pounds in China, which is more than the total investment of all other countries (including Japan). In the past, British goods accounted for 12% of China's total imports, but in the first ten months of 1938, they only accounted for 8%. The author also cited Taiwan and Korea as examples. Since the above two places were annexed by the Japanese Empire, British trade has fallen to 1%. The trade situation in "Manchukuo" has also evolved similarly. If Japan can realize its plan in the future, it will not only monopolize the trade in the five provinces of North China, but even the trade in Central China. The Daily Telegraph takes the same attitude. The Sino-Japanese-Manchu Group's damage to the interests of Western powers has reached a degree that the powers cannot tolerate. Even German stores have been unable to gain a foothold in Manchuria, and American and British gasoline companies have been hit even harder since "Manchukuo" implemented oil controls. An examination of the current situation of British investment shows that China has the largest amount of foreign investment after Argentina. Therefore, the United Kingdom's economic interests in China are even greater than those of the United States. As for Japan, if the East Asian Economic Group achieves its wishes, it can obtain raw materials from China at will, and the benefits are self-evident. (Haitong, 4th)

(London) The Yorkshire Post (known as the organ of former Foreign Secretary Eden) recently reported that the British Cabinet ministers will discuss countermeasures to the policies implemented by Japan in China before the parliament reconvenes on the 31st of this month. At that time, they may adopt a tougher attitude to deal with Japan's discrimination against British trade. All actions taken by the British side will be in line with the attitude of the United States. (Havas, 4th)

### Artillery Battle on the East Bank of the Yellow River, Chinese Troops Assault Japanese Troops in the Ancient County of Wencheng Amidst Intense Gunfire

### Zhou Zuoren Survives Assassination Attempt

(Beiping) Yesterday, a young man went to the residence of Zhou Zuoren, a famous writer and former professor at Peking University, intending to assassinate him.

The Japanese authorities have now announced drastic measures to suppress such terrorist activities. (Haitong, 4th)

### Chinese Troops Counterattack Southwest of Sanshui, Heavy Casualties Among Japanese Troops at Taiping Market

(Hong Kong) In recent days, both the Cantonese and Japanese sides have had little activity due to Wang Jingwei's departure and hopes of promoting peace. The general resignation of the Japanese cabinet has had a more profound impact on the war situation in South China. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Chinese army launched simultaneous counterattacks against the Japanese army southwest of Sanshui and in other directions, achieving considerable success. The Japanese troops at Taiping Market in Fogang were heavily attacked by the Chinese army yesterday, caught off guard, and suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese army is now only up to Fogang. Conghua is definitely in the hands of the Chinese army. (Special dispatch, 1:00 AM, 5th)

(Hong Kong) The Japanese army in Dongjiang is now concentrated in Zengcheng, Dongguan, and Taiping, totaling more than 20,000 men. The various units of the Chinese army counterattacking in the eastern sector have completed their movements. (1) Crossing Lianhe Xu from Boluo Futian to Lizhi Ao.

Another unit broke into the north gate of Zengcheng and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army, destroying nearby bridges. After fighting each other until dawn, the Japanese army was unable to hold out and dispatched reinforcements from Shitan and Guangzhou, densely bombarding the Chinese side with artillery. The Chinese army, considering that its mission had been accomplished, withdrew to its original defenses and held firm. The Japanese army did not dare to pursue them out of the city. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 90 casualties in the Shetouling area, and more than 70 Japanese soldiers were killed in the Zengcheng area. (4th)

Zhanggongdu: The Lushan Chinese guerrilla force often takes an offensive stance, active in the rear of the Japanese army on the north bank of the Xiuhe River, and has repeatedly achieved military victories. At dawn on New Year's Day, when the Chinese forces launched a general attack on the entire Nanxun line, they also simultaneously launched attacks on the Japanese army in four routes. One route attacked the Japanese army in Gaolong Zaijiajian, defeating the Japanese army, killing more than ten Japanese soldiers, and seizing two rifles, military blankets, military helmets, and other military supplies. Another route, in coordination with the local people's self-defense force, attacked the Japanese army at Qiaojianshan, the tip of Hebei Bridge, killing and wounding more than 40 Japanese soldiers, seizing two light machine guns, seven rifles, two bicycles, a telescope, and many other military supplies.

### Japanese Army Fiercely Attacks the North Bank Positions of Zhanggongdu, Chinese Troops Launch Attacks and Inflict Heavy Damage on the Japanese Side, Japanese Troops in Qiujin Also Open Fire and Bombard Randomly

Zhanggongdu: On the afternoon of the 3rd, the Japanese army, gathering more than 700 men, launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army on the north bank of Zhanggongdu. After the Chinese army bravely repelled the attack, they gathered again at 7:00 PM that evening, gathering more than 500 men, and once again launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army on the north bank. The Chinese defenders calmly responded, bravely launching an attack, and engaged in several hand-to-hand combats with the Japanese army. Until the afternoon of the 4th, the Japanese army's offensive weakened due to heavy losses. After dusk, the battle situation calmed down slightly. On the 4th, the Japanese army in Qiujin continuously used fierce artillery fire to bombard the Chinese army's south bank of Zhanggongdu, Tonganling, and the highway area, firing more than 800 rounds, seemingly to cover the attacking units of the Japanese army on the north bank of Zhanggongdu. At the time of dispatch, clear artillery fire could still be heard. (4th)

Zhanggongdu: In retaliation for the Chinese side's attack on New Year's Day, the Japanese army has been gradually moving the Japanese army from Jiujiang, Xingzi, De'an, and other places forward. Since 3:00 PM on the 3rd, they have concentrated artillery fire to bombard the Chinese positions in Zhanggongdu and the south bank of the Xiuhe River, and used hundreds of infantrymen to launch a fierce attack on Zhanggongdu under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese army responded calmly and fought fiercely for several hours. The Japanese army ultimately did not succeed.

### U.S. Navy Department Submits Document to Congress: Establishment of Thirty Military Bases; Existing Bases on the Philippine Islands to be Maintained; President Roosevelt Proposes Revision of Neutrality Law

(Washington) The Navy Department recently submitted a memorandum to the 76th Congress requesting the immediate construction of thirty aviation bases and submarine destroyer/mine-laying ship bases on various U.S. possessions.  Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, also submitted a report to Congress advocating the establishment of an impregnable naval base on Guam in the Pacific (the Washington Treaty of 1922 stipulated that Guam could not be fortified).  The island is the closest U.S. territory to Japan.  When the U.S. Navy withdraws from the Philippine Islands in the future, Guam should become the forward-most U.S. naval base in the Pacific. Its scale should be as large as possible to accommodate a large portion of the U.S. fleet and facilitate the defense of the Hawaiian Islands and the U.S. Pacific coast. In addition, Admiral Hepburn proposed strengthening defenses along the Atlantic coast, the Pacific coast, and the central Pacific.  The main points are as follows: (1) The aviation base at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on the Atlantic coast should be strengthened, and aviation bases should be added at Narragansett Bay, New England; the southeastern coast of Florida; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. (2) The base at San Diego on the Pacific coast should be strengthened, and the base at Alameda Bay should be maintained. At the same time, essential bases should be added at three locations on the Alaskan Peninsula: Sitka Island, and Kodiak Island. (3) The base at Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands in the central Pacific should be strengthened, while existing bases in the Philippine Islands should be maintained within the limits of not hindering current U.S. foreign policy. (Havas, 3rd)

(Washington) After the opening of the 76th U.S. Congress today, President Roosevelt is reportedly scheduled to submit a message on the 4th of this month, stating that the Neutrality Law in its current form is unfair, and under certain circumstances, it facilitates aggressor nations and must be thoroughly revised. In addition, the President will submit the 1939-40 budget to Congress on the 5th of this month, and a message on national defense within the next week. (Havas, 3rd)

(Washington) President Roosevelt, while speaking today with Acting Secretary of State Welles and Justice Department officials, is reported to have raised for discussion the question of how to penalize American merchants who violate the Neutrality Law by privately smuggling arms for export. (Havas, 3rd)

(Washington) The 76th U.S. Congress convened today, and conservatives from both the Republican and Democratic parties will likely unite to oppose President Roosevelt's New Deal. After the adjournment of the 75th Congress, the government's attitude toward totalitarian countries hardened. It is unknown whether Congress agrees with this government policy.  Asking Congress to vote to approve vast national defense expenditures is likely to encounter considerable backlash. President Roosevelt's message to Congress is ready and he is expected to personally deliver it to Congress tomorrow, but he will present the construction of national defense to Congress within the next week.  Although the amount of funding the President proposes for the Army and Navy is still unknown, it is estimated to be between $1,300,000,000 and $1,500,000,000; only with this amount can 12,000 military aircraft and two 45,000-ton battleships be built, and the personnel and equipment of the Army and Air Force be enhanced. Although the preliminary meeting of Congress today seemed harmonious on the surface, signs of political warfare are evident everywhere, as many of the proposals registered by the important committees of the two houses are highly contentious. Conservative Democrats are now mostly gathered around Vice President Garner, whose prestige has greatly increased in the last two months. The intention of conservative Democrats is to revise President Roosevelt's New Deal in the next two years and to nominate a conservative figure as a presidential candidate at the 1940 Democratic National Convention. As for the President's position in Congress, it has been greatly strengthened as many strong supporters of the New Deal have been elected, such as Senator Barkley, who has been elected Senate Majority Leader, and Congressman Bankhead, who has been re-elected Speaker of the House. (AP, 3rd)

(Washington) The 76th U.S. Congress opened at noon today.  The chambers of both the Senate and the House were crowded.  New and returning members were introduced to each other. The thirty-five newly elected senators were immediately sworn in before the President of the Senate, Vice President Garner. The representatives must wait until Speaker of the House Bankhead is elected for reelection before they can be sworn in.  Today Congress only held the opening ceremony; apart from the routine announcement of the opening of the session, no resolutions were discussed.  The atmosphere in the chamber was extremely harmonious, but it is widely understood among most members that heated debates will inevitably arise when the Neutrality Law, national defense, and unemployment relief issues are discussed in the future. The party distribution in the 76th Congress is as follows: Senate: 69 Democrats, 23 Republicans, 1 Progressive, 1 Independent, and 2 Farmer-Labor; House of Representatives: 261 Democrats, 169 Republicans, 2 Progressives, 1 Farmer-Labor, and 1 American Labor. (Havas, 3rd)

(Washington) The 76th U.S. Congress convened yesterday, with national defense and public relief being the two most pressing issues. It is generally expected that President Roosevelt and Vice President Garner will compete for control of the Democratic Party, in what most newspapers openly declare is a "struggle for supremacy." Garner represents the conservative wing of the Democratic Party and intends to revise parts of the New Deal, generally reorganize its procedures, and limit its continued implementation. President Roosevelt, on the other hand, will strive to maintain his freedom within the party and ensure the nomination of a progressive candidate for president in 1940. It is said that Roosevelt is handling the relief issue quite swiftly, simply notifying Congress that if it does not vote to approve funding for the Works Progress Administration, 3 million people will be unemployed by February 7. Currently, Republicans and conservative Democrats are advocating for cuts to relief spending and the return of administrative power to the states to prevent unemployment from being politically manipulated. However, government officials say they believe that opposition politicians will act cautiously and vote to approve the necessary funds when faced with the responsibility of deciding whether to continue or interrupt the funds upon which millions of people depend for their livelihoods. It is anticipated that President Roosevelt's message to Congress today will use strong language to reiterate his opposition to the advancement of authoritarianism and urge the United States to declare its leadership of the democratic front in the Americas, even if it means maintaining it on a larger scale. Bankhead was re-elected Speaker yesterday by a vote of 250 to 167. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted yesterday that this Congress will undertake a complete review of legislation that could affect U.S. relations with other countries. (Reuters, 4th)

### Pittman's Speech: A Prelude to a Hardline Policy: The U.S. Will Take All Possible Measures to Deal with Treaty Violations and Aggression by Various Countries

(Washington) Following Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issuing a statement the other day advocating the prohibition of Japanese goods being imported into the United States and the transportation of American goods to Japan, well-informed sources here recently declared that the U.S. government has practically decided to use every means short of war, including breaking off diplomatic relations, to resist any country that violates existing treaties, engages in military aggression, or incites unrest in other countries in the hope of changing the current international situation. This opinion was expressed by Pittman. In addition, Pittman said that even if Japan were to declare war on the United States in the future, it would not have a major impact on the United States. This statement also applies to Germany. Some say that if the United States takes overly harsh measures against totalitarian countries, it may provoke war. However, judging from Pittman's statement, it can be seen that members of the U.S. government are prepared to refute this argument and will continue to propagate the idea that the American people are clear about the strength of the United States and its geographical advantages, and in reality, there is no need to worry about any war crisis. The responsibility of the United States is to maintain the fundamental principles of democracy and the international order with the greatest perseverance. It seems that President Roosevelt has decided to continue to psychologically mobilize the entire nation to resist totalitarian countries. Public opinion largely supports this move by the President. In the case of the Sino-Japanese conflict, American public opinion generally supports providing loans to China. Regarding the Spanish issue, American sympathy for the Nationalist government is decreasing day by day. Even American Catholics, who previously supported the Nationalists, are now divided in their opinions. Conversely, there is a growing number of people advocating providing food to the Republican government of Spain and even lifting the arms embargo on the Republican government. Not only that, but one of the key points of the U.S. naval expansion plan is to strengthen the defenses of Guam in the Pacific, which shows the government's intention to ensure that both the continental U.S. and its distant territories are prepared for any eventuality. Once Pittman's proposed measures are implemented, even if Japan attacks the United States, it will be able to resist. As for how Congress will react to this firm policy, it is currently difficult to say. Although the number of isolationists is not very large, they still retain considerable influence. There may be debates when Congress discusses the amendment of the Neutrality Law in the future, because the amendment of the Neutrality Law is truly a touchstone of whether the United States can implement a new foreign policy. (Havas, 3rd)

### Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Vows to Defend the Motherland

(Moscow) Newspapers here recently published the oath of the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Navy, which reads: "I, a citizen of the Soviet Union, joining the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, hereby swear with utmost sincerity to always be an upright, brave, and disciplined soldier, and I am willing to forever safeguard the state's military secrets, obey military regulations and the orders of superiors.

New recruits to the Red Army Navy must take the oath no later than two months after arriving at their location. Before the oath, the officers explain their tasks, the importance of the oath, and the obligations regarding military service and the defense of the Motherland in Articles 132 and 133 of the Soviet Constitution. Each person is given a day off on the day of the oath. According to a resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Navy and border guards must take the oath on February 23, 1939, which is the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Red Army.

Godia, Vice President of the Tunisian Consultative Council and French member, gave a speech saying that the French in Tunisia were unanimously determined to firmly reject unreasonable demands from foreign countries. Chenik, the leader of the Tunisian members, followed with a speech stating that the Tunisian natives were entirely loyal to France and that there were similarities between France's democratic ideals and the Muslims' ideals of freedom and equality. He expressed outrage at certain demands that sought to treat them with outdated colonial attitudes. (Havas, 3rd)

### The Experiences of the Red Army Led by Xiang Ying Participating in the War of Resistance Against Japan (Continued): Most of the New Fourth Army Operates on Both Sides of the Yangtze River; Has Now Recaptured Tongcheng, Shucheng, and Chaoxian

The base of the New Fourth Route Army is in Anhui, and most of its operations are on both sides of the Yangtze River in that province. A part of the army is active in Jurong and Jintan in the Nanjing area. The main base of Anhui supplies it with munitions. The New Fourth Route Army is not like the Eighth Route Army, without its own government. It is commanded by the Third War Area Headquarters and supplied with munitions. Its area of activity is roughly semi-circular, extending from the Nanjing area to 200 miles to the east and as far as Lu'an to the west. Its supply base is within 80 miles on both sides of the Yangtze River. Four-tenths of the army's forces are on the north bank, which is more suitable for guerrilla warfare because there are many steep mountains and forests, making it easy to retreat and to ambush. There are also many large villages, with ample food supply, and mass mobilization is more widespread. Therefore, when Japanese trucks enter the area, villagers prepare to help attack. According to the army, last summer they overturned and destroyed as many as 60 Japanese trucks. In the New Fourth Route Army's area of operations on the north bank of the Yangtze River, there are two highways that the Japanese used to attack Hankou last summer. The mountain range is between the two routes, so the area is also suitable for guerrilla warfare. According to the New Fourth Route Army, the highway from Hefei to Hanshan is now impassable, and the highway from Hefei to the south is often damaged. When the Japanese army advanced along the Hefei-Huangmei highway last year, even though the New Fourth Route Army was not yet fully organized, it fully utilized the terrain to cut off the Japanese rear supply lines, destroy highways, and destroy bridges. At that time, the Japanese army had no spare strength and no intention of fighting guerrillas in the rear, so their advance was delayed. According to the army, when the Japanese army attacked Wuhan, they destroyed 150 Japanese trucks on the highway to Huangmei. Today, the New Fourth Route Army has recaptured Tongcheng, Shucheng, and Chaoxian. So far, the main Japanese bases on the north bank are Hanshan and Anqing. The south bank is not as suitable for guerrilla warfare as the north bank, because there are many plains, rivers and streams crisscross, the Japanese can use small motorboats, the river surface is eight feet higher than the ground, the levees are easy to breach, causing floods, and there are few forests near the mountains along the river. Because the New Fourth Route Army puts the people first, they not only do not breach the levees to trap the Japanese army, but also prevent the Japanese army from doing so to the best of their ability. As in other guerrilla areas, the Japanese army in the area only occupies the main transportation lines and large cities, while most of the area is still under Chinese control. It is claimed that, except for Jiangning County south of Nanjing, all other counties have government-appointed county magistrates. So far, the Japanese army in the area does not dare to advance, but instead concentrates its forces to protect the transportation lines. The terrain behind the New Fourth Route Army's operations on the south bank gradually rises, eventually reaching the Yellow Mountains, which are 1,400 meters above sea level. The area has beautiful scenery, a mild climate, and rice, wheat, and tea as its main products. Since the terrain is suitable for guerrilla warfare and the products are abundant, the New Fourth Route Army in the area can be expected to make a new record in its history.

### Rugao: River Bandits Rampant; Passengers of the Ruihe Robbed; Losses Exceed 70,000 Yuan

Rugao Correspondence: Rugao is adjacent to the river and the sea, with an extremely long coastline. Since its fall, the riverbanks have been frequently shelled by Japanese warships, making it impossible for guerrillas to deploy defenses. However, land routes are strictly inspected, so banditry on the shore is rare. But in the river, bandits appear and disappear at will, day and night. At the end of last month, two rowing boats leaving the county were consecutively robbed by bandits, carrying pigs worth more than 5,000 yuan, which have not yet been returned. On the morning of the 31st, the Ruihe ship sailed from Shanghai to Changyinsha, with about 30 Rugao passengers on board, some coming to Shanghai to sell goods, others to settle accounts before the New Year. After disembarking, they transferred to iron barges, which were towed by small steamers to various ports in Rugao. That day, due to a missed schedule and strong winds, the passengers could not bear the cold. Coincidentally, a rowing boat approached the iron barge, and they all eagerly disembarked. The boat sailed west with its sails up, heading towards Dongjie Port, when suddenly it dropped anchor, demanding rowing fees. After a long while, it proceeded west again. At this time, another boat had already raced ahead to the west from Dongjie Port. As the rowing boat approached that boat, seven or eight bandits jumped into the rowing boat, brandishing guns and shouting threats, driving the passengers into the bandit boat and carrying away their goods. After searching each passenger and confiscating their money and belongings, they drove them back into the rowing boat. Before leaving, they pointed their guns at the passengers and shouted loudly, "We are from Xinshenggang (Japanese-occupied territory)!" They then pointed at the boatman and said, "This boatman is not a good person and should be shot immediately!" Then they roared away. The passengers were all deathly pale. Among them, a cotton merchant named Mr. Li had 17,000 yuan confiscated, which was hidden in an orange basket, the entire basket being taken away. A ham merchant had 15,000 yuan confiscated. The total loss for the entire boat was more than 70,000 yuan. The passengers were distraught, weeping, and almost wanted to throw themselves into the river. After the bandit boat left, the rowing boat raised its sails and headed north. When it approached Xiaoligang (Tongjing), another bandit boat suddenly appeared, shining a searchlight. The passengers, like startled birds, quickly docked at the Xiaoligang beach and fled through the sand. As they came ashore, the rowing boat was deemed suspicious, so they reported it to the troops stationed at the port, who apprehended and interrogated them. According to their confession, they admitted to being accomplices in the robbery. The chief of the Qiao detachment, considering the boat's involvement in the robbery of passengers to be extremely unlawful, ordered them to be shot as a warning. Now, all passengers traveling to and from the area are filled with fear and vigilance due to the rampant banditry, lamenting the difficulty of travel.

### The Jiangnan People's Self-Defense Corps Actively Deploys to Recover Lost Territory, Mobilizing the Military and Civilians for Cooperation, and Elucidating the Meaning of Warfare

Zhenjiang Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, civilian armed forces have also been extensively developed. The "Never Be Slaves People's Self-Defense Corps" is also active. The Jiangnan United Corps Command of the corps is currently actively deploying to recover lost territory, and it is heard that their first goal is to recover Guangde, Changxing, and Yixing, as capturing these three places would allow them to control Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The Command is also mobilizing the military and civilians for cooperation, promoting both broad and narrow senses of warfare, and has issued various propaganda materials to ensure that the people thoroughly understand. Excerpts from the propaganda materials are as follows: (I) The Name of War: If the name is not correct, words are not smooth; if words are not smooth, things cannot be accomplished. Therefore, a gentleman must be able to speak, and what he says must be practicable. This is why Confucius told Zilu that if he had to correct something, he would start with the name when Wei Zhe seized the country and resisted his father. Applying this principle, no matter what, correcting the name is the most important and the first thing to do, especially in a war that concerns the nation's honor. Tang exiled Jie, and Wu attacked Zhou to save the people. Emperor Gao of Han rose in revolt to drive out the tyrannical Qin. Zhuge Liang attacked Wei to restore the Han Dynasty. Li Yuan replaced the Sui Dynasty, following the will of Heaven and the people. Emperor Taizu of Ming transferred the mandate of the Yuan Dynasty, and Sun Yat-sen overthrew the Qing Dynasty, embodying nationalism. Washington broke away from Britain to seek independence, unable to endure British oppression. The North and South American Civil War lasted for decades because Lincoln wanted to liberate black slaves. All of these were justified, and they were able to seize the initiative with their righteous cause. What about the Japanese invaders? They seized our Northeast Provinces on September 18th, disturbed our Shanghai on January 28th, launched a surprise attack on Lugouqiao on July 7th, and then massively invaded Shanghai on August 13th. All of these were unprovoked attacks. The reason they didn't declare war is that their cause is unjust. Now, try to ask anyone for a legitimate reason for their war, and I dare say that no one can provide an answer on their behalf. However, our country is different. The Japanese invaders' rape and slaughter of our people are meant to insult our national dignity. We use war to preserve it. The Japanese invaders' threats and enticements of our people are meant to undermine our national dignity. We use war to protect it. The Japanese invaders' enslavement policies toward our people are meant to destroy our national dignity. We use war to build a strong guarantee of our national dignity, so that the two words "national dignity" will shine for all eternity, as bright as the sun and stars, lasting as long as heaven and earth. With a correct name and smooth words, how can the cunning and cruel Japanese invaders succeed?

(II) Broad and Narrow Warfare: As the saying goes, "A military can be unused for a hundred years, but it cannot be unprepared for a single day." Being prepared means not forgetting war. Not forgetting war requires preparing for war, and then we can talk about war. However, preparation can be tangible or intangible, and war can be tangible or intangible. Tangible preparation is how we prepare against others, while intangible preparation can make others relax their guard and forget about preparing against us. Tangible warfare cannot guarantee victory even with fierce fighting, while intangible warfare can subdue others without fighting. This is the distinction between broad and narrow senses of warfare. What is the narrow sense? It is tangible preparation and tangible warfare. What is the broad sense? It is intangible preparation and intangible warfare.

King Zhao Ling of Zhao changed to Hu clothing and learned horsemanship and archery, so the Xiongnu dared not spy on Zhao's borders. This is preparation that belongs to the tangible. Goujian spent ten years accumulating resources and ten years training his people, eventually defeating Wu. This is preparation that belongs to the intangible. Zhou Yu defeated Cao Cao at the Red Cliffs, and Xie An defeated Fu Jian at the Fei River. This is warfare that belongs to the tangible. Tao Kan practiced labor by moving bricks, and Liu Kun danced with the crowing of the rooster. Although these are not related to warfare, the spirit of warfare is revealed in the intangible. Moreover, since ancient times in our country, peasants have also practiced archery and horsemanship. The feudal lords did not abandon hunting in the meadows, which is the same as Westerners holding horse races, boat races, and ball games, all to promote a martial spirit and prepare for the selection of future defenders of the country. We should not wait until the war has already begun before starting training. Alas, the broad sense of warfare is indeed more necessary than the narrow sense of warfare. The Japanese invaders are relying on the full force of their sea, land, and air power to invade our country. This clearly belongs to the scope of narrow warfare, but they do not know that they devoted themselves to the broad sense of warfare decades ago before daring to launch a large-scale invasion against our country. Economic aggression, cultural aggression, and the establishment of special agent organizations throughout the provinces of North China all started with the four words "broad warfare." Alas, how terrifying! Therefore, our country must mobilize the entire nation to engage in a universal movement of broad warfare in order to contend with the Japanese invaders. Gandhi spun yarn, wove cloth, dried salt, and even fasted in order to achieve India's independence. Piłsudski restored Poland by teaching piano. These are all excellent models of broad warfare, which our people should urgently emulate. If we can learn their spirit and train the entire nation into soldiers, even if the Japanese invaders are strong, it will not be difficult to devise a plan to annihilate them in jest. Alas, how can we have a home if the Xiongnu are not destroyed? This life-and-death moment is only for the final struggle. May our people not neglect it!

(III) The Meaning of Broad Warfare: The meaning of broad warfare has been outlined in the previous "Broad and Narrow Warfare," but the importance of engaging in broad warfare is actually ten times or a hundred times greater than that of narrow warfare. Therefore, I will supplement it as follows. The meaning and importance of broad warfare, the theories of which are scattered throughout the classics and commentaries, are most detailed in the Book of Mencius. Mencius said to King Hui of Liang, "If Your Majesty implements benevolent governance for the people, reduces punishments and taxes, encourages deep plowing and weeding, and allows the strong to use their leisure time to cultivate filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, and trustworthiness, entering to serve their fathers and elder brothers, and going out to serve their superiors, you can enable them to use sticks to beat Qin and Chu's strong armor and sharp weapons." He also said, "To secure the people, do not rely on the boundaries of the territory; to fortify the country, do not rely on the dangers of mountains and streams; to awe the world, do not rely on the benefits of weapons and armor. Those who gain the Dao have much help; those who lose the Dao have little help. To the extreme of having little help, even relatives will betray them. To the extreme of having much help, the world will submit to them. Using what the world submits to attack those whom relatives betray, therefore, a gentleman may not fight, but if he fights, he will surely win." Although Mencius did not explicitly define the term "broad warfare," his theory has exhaustively elucidated the meaning and importance of the four words "broad warfare." Mencius argued that to achieve military victory, one must first focus on the people's army. What is the people's army? It is education and politics. Seeking victory in military affairs is like digging a well when thirsty, while starting with education and politics is like preparing mugwort beforehand when treating a disease. Looking back over the millennia and across the nine continents, none can escape the scope of Mencius's theory. Yue's defeat of Wu and Germany's victory over France were both based on education and politics. The current large-scale invasion by the Japanese also stems from their decades of diligent governance throughout the country before daring to recklessly attempt it. Airplanes and cannons are merely the tools of their narrow warfare. Duke Huan of Qi united the feudal lords nine times without using military chariots, and Duke Wen of Jin showed good faith when attacking Yuan and demonstrated ritual during a grand hunting, achieving hegemony after one battle. All of these were preparations made before war, and that is how they achieved such results. However, I believe that even when two countries face each other in battle, one cannot rely solely on strong armor and sharp weapons to defeat a powerful enemy. Zhizhiwu originally declined to serve as a war minister but ultimately relied on persuasion to repel the tyrannical Qin. Zheng Xuangao, as a merchant, feigned a welcome to the troops and relieved the national crisis. Similarly, Sun Bin used deception to avenge himself, Zhuge Liang used the Empty City Stratagem to repel the enemy, Zhang Zifang replaced flags, and Tan Daokai sang while measuring sand. As the saying goes, "Application lies in the heart," and it is up to the commander to be divine and enlightened. Furthermore, to gain the hearts of the military, one must first gain the hearts of the people. If one gains the hearts of the people and uses them well, one can achieve the effect of the entire nation being soldiers. If one does not use them well, one will immediately face the danger of being in the same boat with the enemy. The people are like water, which can carry a boat or overturn it. The common people can be deceived but cannot be truly deceived. Here, I will discuss the importance of broad warfare in detail and briefly add my own opinions.

### After the Fall of Guangzhou: Observations Along the Guangdong-Guangxi Route (I): Refugees Overcrowded, Many Dead and Injured; All Counties and Towns Bombed

Wuzhou Correspondence: When Guangzhou was unfortunately lost under the defense of Yu Hanmou, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, on October 21st, as the lifeblood of Guangzhou was hanging by a thread, your correspondent decided to leave the city, cross the river from Huangsha to escape danger, and walk westwards by land. Passing through Shunde, Panyu, Nanhai, Sanshui, Gaoming, and Gaoyao, I then went up the West River into Guangxi. Along the way, either due to vehicle congestion or temporarily staying in various market towns and villages, I inquired about the situation in various places. Therefore, it took me more than twenty days to reach the border of Guangxi. I will now record the observations and situations along the way as follows:

Guangzhou unfortunately fell on October 21st, under the defense of Yu Hanmou, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army. That night, as the lifeblood of Guangzhou was in imminent danger, your correspondent decided to leave the city, crossed the river from Huangsha to Fangcun. When I arrived at the Huangsha wharf, I saw crowds of citizens, young and old, carrying their belongings, packed together and vying to cross. The sounds of shouting and crying merged into one. Shops were also scrambling to move goods out of the city, either crossing to Shiwetang, going to Fangcun, or moving to Henan. Cars, trucks, and rickshaws filled the roads, leaving pedestrians with almost no room to turn around. In the midst of the clamor and congestion, an air raid alarm suddenly sounded, and all the lights in the city went out. The refugees were even more frightened and in a more desperate state. The elderly, weak, men, women, and children who were pushed into the water or suffocated to death along the coast were found everywhere. I hired a small sampan for five yuan and crossed from Huangsha to Fangcun. When I landed, it was already past 9:00 PM. Looking towards the Huangsha Railway Station on the north bank, I saw dark shadows moving about. A moment later, the sound of machine guns erupted near the station, as dense as firecrackers, lasting for a full twenty minutes before stopping. At that time, several locomotives were firing up in the station, waiting for orders. Large numbers of troops were gathered before and after the station, and military supplies and heavy weapons were piled up like mountains, presumably waiting to board the trains and retreat north along the Guangdong Railway. That night, the order in Guangzhou had already fallen into a state of chaos. (To be continued)

### A Brief History of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association

— Shugan

The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association was established in the spring of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927). The motive for its organization was to oppose the increase in house taxes in the French Concession and to demand an increase in Chinese directors and the political participation of citizens. The stated purpose was to develop autonomy within the concession, seek public benefits, and advocate for equal treatment.

The presence of Chinese directors on the French Concession Municipal Council actually began with Article 4 of the agreement between China and France regarding the extraterritorial roads of the French Concession on April 8, 3rd year of the Republic of China (1914). At that time, the first Chinese directors were Wu Xin, the director of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall, and Lu Bohong, the general manager of the Huashang Electric Company. After taking office, they established a Chinese Directors Office near the Sanyangjing Bridge on Avenue Edward VII, with 300 taels of office expenses to be allocated monthly by the Jiangsu Finance Department. Later, due to the financial difficulties of Jiangsu Province, the aforementioned funding was suspended for a long time, and the office also ceased operations. In the 8th year of the Republic of China (1919), Wu's position became vacant, and the vacancy was filled by Lu Wennong, director of the Bao'an Hall. Lu's position became vacant in the 15th year of the Republic of China (1926), and was not filled. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the taxpayers in the concession believed that the Municipal Council only had two Chinese directors, and they were all appointed by the French Consul General. Although the Chinese directors had fulfilled their due responsibilities, the number of seats was too few and lacked fairness. Therefore, they launched a movement to demand an increase in Chinese directors. At that time, the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, and the international situation changed greatly. The French Concession authorities, taking into account the people's sentiment, automatically promulgated a new charter for the Municipal Council and increased the number of Chinese members to three. The first Chinese members were Zhu Yanzhi, Wu Zonglian, and Wei Tingrong. However, this did not shake the belief of the general taxpayers in demanding an increase. On the contrary, it inspired their awareness of organization, making them understand that only organized action could generate great power and achieve the desired goals. Therefore, they convened an inaugural meeting and publicly elected Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, and Du Yuesheng as the preparatory directors of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, and established a preparatory office at Eight Immortals Lane on Rue Wagner. Coincidentally, at that time (July of the 16th year), the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement planned to increase the house tax from 14% to 16%. The French Municipal Council followed suit and also prepared to increase the first and second house taxes to 14% (Note: The two concessions have always taken the same steps in collecting house taxes and other reforms. However, in the 10th year of the Republic of China, the authorities of the two concessions both planned to increase the house tax from 12% to 14%. After the Shanghai Commercial Federation of the French Concession sent a letter to politely discuss the matter, the French Consul General Mr. Fletchers reviewed the financial situation of the Municipal Council and then automatically waived the increase. This is the origin of the difference in house tax rates between the two concessions). The preparatory committee used the slogan of opposing the increase in house taxes to enhance its appeal. The reason given was that the Municipal Council's budget for that year had a very slight deficit, and there was no need to increase the house tax. After several resolutions opposing the increase, the French Municipal Council realized that it was not appropriate to increase the tax without the consent of the citizen groups. Therefore, they asked Du Yuesheng to mediate to avoid escalating the situation. After Du Yuesheng's repeated consultations, the two sides agreed to temporarily increase the tax for six months to make up for the Municipal Council's budget deficit for that year. After six months, the original rate of 12% would be resumed. Therefore, all the 14% house tax bills that had already been printed by the French Municipal Council in the autumn and winter of the 16th year were temporarily stamped with the words "Temporarily collected for six months" to serve as a marker. (Note: This case was renegotiated the following year, and the rate was reduced by one percent, which is the current 13% rate collected by the French Municipal Council.)

After the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association resolved the case of opposing the tax increase, it established a temporary council. It was organized by twenty-seven temporary council members elected by representatives of various organizations. In January of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the first re-election was held. More than 800 voting citizens elected twenty-one citizen representatives and twenty-four organization representatives. The representatives held a general meeting and elected fifteen executive committee members, including Gong Jingyan, Xu Caicheng, Qu Zhenhua, and Dong Kechang, and four alternates, including Yuan Ludeng and Fang Jiaobo. The supervisory committee consisted of Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, and Jin Tingsun, with Lu Tingjian and Xie Qianggong as alternates. Zhang Xiaolin was elected as the chairman of the committee.

In July of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Chinese directors Wu Zonglian and Zhang Xiaolin resigned successively. The general meeting of representatives elected Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin as Chinese directors to the French Municipal Council. As for the case of demanding an increase in Chinese directors, it was not until October 23rd of the 19th year of the Republic of China that the French Consul General responded, agreeing to establish five Chinese director seats and nine special committee members. On November 8th of the same year, the association convened a general meeting of representatives and elected Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Zhu Yanzhi, Wei Tingrong, and Lu Bohong as Chinese directors for 1930, and Zhang Jixian, Jin Tingsun, and Gong Jingyan as nine Chinese committee members. This was the beginning of Chinese directors being completely elected by the people.

In July of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the second re-election was held. The number of participating voters was greater than the first election. Most of the executive and supervisory committee members were re-elected, but Du Yuesheng was elected as the chairman of the committee.

In the 21st year of the Republic of China, Du Yuesheng resigned from his concurrent position as Chinese director to focus on association affairs, and his concurrent position was succeeded by Qi Yunqing.

In December of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the third re-election was held. The number of participating voters was even greater. The number of executive and supervisory committee members was also increased. The executive committee members were Du Yuesheng, Gong Jingyan, Jin Liren, Qu Zhenhua, Mao Yun, Dong Kechang, Wang Deyan, etc., nineteen people, with Xue Fuji, Gu Wensheng, etc., seven people as alternates. The supervisory committee members were Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Jin Tingsun, Zhu Wenqi, Dai Chunfeng, etc., five people, with Shao Baoxing, Lu Tingjian, etc., three people as alternates. The first resolution meeting of the executive committee re-elected Du Yuesheng as chairman.

In December of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Zhang Xiaolin, Lu Bohong, Zhu Yanzhi, Qi Yunqing, and Wu Kaisheng were re-elected as Chinese directors for 1934, and Zhang Xiaoxian, Jin Tingsun, Gong Jingyan, etc., nine people, were re-elected as Chinese committee members.

In December of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Zhang Xiaolin, Lu Bohong, Zhu Yanzhi, Qi Yunqing, and Zhang Jixian were re-elected as Chinese directors for 1935.

In December of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the fourth re-election was held. More than 3,700 voters participated, electing citizen representatives such as Du Yuesheng, twenty-one people; organization representatives were elected by the Second Special District Citizens' Federation, etc., such as Qu Zhenhua, twenty-four people. A general meeting of representatives was held at the Zhonghui Building on December 25th, electing Du Yuesheng, Jin Tingsun, Dong Kechang, Mao Yun, Qu Zhenhua, etc., nineteen people as executive committee members, and Zhu Wende, Zhang Xiangyun, seven people as alternates. Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhu Wenqi, etc., five people as supervisory committee members, and Shao Binxing, etc., three people as alternates. Du Yuesheng was elected as chairman, and Jin Tingsun as vice-chairman. As for the 1936 Chinese directors, they were Zhang Xiaolin, Lu Bohong, Qian Xinzhi, Qi Yunqing, and Zhang Jixian. The Chinese committee members were Zu Xingrang, Zhang Fayao, Dong Kechang, etc., nine people. In 1937, the Chinese directors were not re-elected due to the war. This year (1938), due to the vacancy of Chinese director Lu Bohong, Zu Xingrang was elected to succeed him, and Zu's vacancy on the Chinese committee was filled by Gui Yanfang. Although there have been personnel changes in the executive committee, due to legal restrictions, it has not been re-elected to this day.

The above is a brief history of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association. The general situation of the organization and the work situation over the years are not within the scope of this article, so they will not be elaborated on.

### American Global Wireless Electric Company Has a National Government License; Japanese Protest Based on Two Key Points; The Company Believes Supervision Is Unnecessary

According to the English Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, the Japanese authorities lodged a protest with the American Consul General in Shanghai regarding the telegrams sent by a certain American wireless electric company. This matter was also mentioned at a press conference held by the Japanese side yesterday (3rd). It was learned that in the past few days, a certain American wireless electric company had sent telegrams from China without being inspected. At the press conference held at the Broadway Mansions last night, the Japanese side informed reporters that the Global Wireless Electric Company, operated by Americans at 51 Guangdong Road, had been sending commercial telegrams. The Japanese authorities had lodged a protest with the American Consul General in Shanghai. It is understood that the Japanese protest is based on two key points: first, the Global Wireless Electric Company's business license was obtained from Chongqing; second, the company sent telegrams "without the supervision of the Japanese authorities." This morning (4th), a person from Global Wireless Electric Company told reporters that the company engaged in such communication business with the permission of the National Government. Therefore, it has been working with the National Government for many years. It has obtained a license from the National Government to send commercial telegrams. According to international communication rules and regulations, only the National Government in China has the right to issue licenses. It also stated that Global Wireless Electric Company is an independent company opened and operated by Americans. According to the rules and regulations of the US Federal Communications Commission, it has obtained its proper license to engage in communication between the US and China. Therefore, Global Wireless Electric Company does not need to be "supervised." At the same time, it was learned that the protest lodged by the Japanese authorities with the American Consul General in Shanghai has been forwarded to Washington for consideration.

### Rice Market Opens; Rice Prices Stable; Transactions Increase; Supply from Inland Also Strong

After the New Year holiday of three days, the rice market in this city reopened yesterday. Rice prices were stable, transactions between rice shops and customers increased sharply, and the supply of rice from inland areas was also strong. After Japanese merchants and the puppet organizations in various counties in the guerrilla areas monopolized food, they evaded taxes and exported it. There were 40,000 to 50,000 bags per week. Details are as follows:

Market Opens; Rice Prices Stable

The Bean and Rice Market at 515 Fuzhou Road, closed on December 31st last year. Due to the New Year, it was also closed for three days as usual. Yesterday (4th), it reopened as usual. From 9:00 AM to 11:45 AM when the market closed, except for the slight increase in the price of thin rice and Ke Xian due to increased demand, the prices of early and late new japonica rice remained the same as at the end of last year. Therefore, the market sentiment was extremely stable.

Transactions Increase; Supply Also Strong

During the three-day New Year holiday, transactions between rice shops and customers stopped. The rice shops used the rice they had in stock to supply the citizens, and their inventory had been reduced. Therefore, after the market opened yesterday, transactions between rice shops and customers increased sharply, with a total transaction volume of 12,000 to 13,000 bags (all warehouse goods). The supply from inland areas was also quite strong. Because the customs office was closed during the holiday, the rice shipped to Shanghai since the end of last year was loaded on ships and began to be unloaded yesterday morning after the customs office opened.

Japanese Merchants Smuggle Large Amounts of Rice

Due to the economic depletion in Japan, heavy taxes, and the increased burden on the people, the Japanese are eager to seek our resources to make up for their losses. In the guerrilla areas within the reach of the Japanese military, Japanese merchants and puppet organizations actively monopolize food. They collect rice in the countryside as much as possible and depress the market price. The farmers are suffering greatly. Farmers in more economically prosperous rural areas store rice and are unwilling to mill it and sell it in order to resist. However, Japanese merchants use collaborators to purchase rice on their behalf everywhere. It is learned that 40,000 to 50,000 bags of rice are shipped from inland areas to Shanghai every week, smuggled out through Hongkou. That is, the rice owned by Chinese merchants is checked under the pretext of military affairs, and then carried away without paying a penny.

### Disposition Method for Smuggling Prohibited Goods for Export: Direct Assistance to the Enemy Verified, Life Imprisonment or Death Penalty

To control the transportation and sale of goods, increase exports, and prevent aiding the enemy, the government, in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, has adjusted the export of goods in various regions. It is learned that the authorities, to prevent the smuggling of prohibited goods for export, have specifically instructed the provincial governments and customs bureaus to implement the following disposition methods if any are discovered: (1) For those transported from the date of the local competent authority's public announcement, the original owner shall be ordered to retrieve the goods and submit a pledge not to smuggle them again; (2) For those transported after the date of the announcement, in addition to confiscating the goods, a fine of up to one thousand yuan may be imposed; (3) If direct sale to the enemy is verified, a sentence of life imprisonment or death penalty shall be imposed; (4) The confiscation of goods and the imposition of fines shall be executed by the local competent authority after submission to and approval by the higher competent authority.

### Telegram Received Yesterday by People in Shanghai: Dinghai's Order Restored, Misunderstanding Between Guerrilla Force and Water Police, Not Pirates Landing, Public Peace of Mind

On December 25th of last year, a guerrilla force of 317 people arrived in Dinghai from Chuansha, Jiangsu, on civilian boats. The county government, considering that the team had come from afar across the sea to preserve the country, treated them with utmost courtesy and selected a public place in the city as the team's garrison location. For five or six days, they lived in peace. Unexpectedly, on the 31st, a misunderstanding suddenly occurred with the original water police in Dinghai. The headquarters of the water police team stationed in Xidao was surrounded by the guerrilla force, and both sides exchanged gunfire with live ammunition, creating an

unusually tense

situation.

Upon hearing the news, the Zhenhai Overseas Water Police Bureau telegraphed Haimen and Shibu, dispatching three squadrons of water police, each with forty-eight men, totaling more than one hundred and forty men. On January 2nd of this year, they arrived in Dinghai on a certain ship. Because they could not dock at the pier, they returned to Zhushanmen. The guerrilla force rushed to that place and ordered two squadrons to surrender their weapons. One remaining squadron, seeing the unfavorable situation, immediately fled back to the original ship, which sailed to Haimen, disembarked the one squadron of water police, and then sailed to Ningbo. This is the factual account of what happened. Investigation reveals that the Dinghai

Water Police Headquarters

had a wireless telegraph, allowing them to communicate with the outside world. At this time, it was also controlled by the guerrilla force, making it impossible to send telegrams, resulting in confusion among fellow villagers in Shanghai regarding the truth, causing great alarm. Several days ago, a bandit gang of over one hundred people raided Linghe Township, causing significant losses to the residents. Because the township is very close to the city, there were rumors outside that bandits had occupied the county seat, which is indeed a minor certainty. Chen Yingxin, the magistrate of Dinghai County,

telegraphed his resignation

and it has already been approved. Lin Shize, a special commissioner of the county party headquarters recommended by Chen, has succeeded him, and the provincial authorities have also approved. Someone with a certain surname, unable to obtain the position of county magistrate, harbored resentment in his heart. Regarding this incident, some suspect that he incited it from within. These are just rumors, and we dare not believe them. Now, the order in the city and streets has been restored. The fellow villagers of Dinghai in Shanghai received reply telegrams yesterday, bringing great peace of mind.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Joint Transportation: Haimen Promulgates Inspection Measures, Jinhua-Ningbo Opens Joint Transportation Service

After Zhejiang East promulgated navigation measures and re-registered ships, Haimen promulgated measures for inspecting ships. Before direct Shanghai-Ningbo voyages are approved, Haimen will serve as the center for organizing joint transportation of passengers and goods. Jinhua-Ningbo will open joint transportation service starting from the 15th. The details are as follows:

Shanghai-Ningbo Joint Transportation: Taizhou as the Center

The Meida vessel of the Portuguese company Melly & Co., operating on the Taizhou-Shibu-Dinghai-Ningbo line, and the Haifu vessel of the German company Reiwa Yoko, operating on the Shanghai-Taizhou line, are jointly operating Shanghai-Ningbo transportation, with Taizhou (i.e., Haimen) as the center. The joint transportation of goods has already been implemented at the end of last month, and the joint transportation of passengers is currently under discussion. The American company Wah Mei & Co. has now decided that the Tangsai vessel operating on the Taizhou-Shibu-Dinghai-Ningbo line and the Tangbei vessel operating on the Shanghai-Taizhou line will jointly operate transportation, also with Taizhou as the center, dividing into passenger and cargo services. Preparations are complete and it is expected to be implemented starting today. The Tangbei is scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Taizhou this morning. For passengers who purchase Shanghai-Ningbo joint tickets, the company will handle the loading and unloading of luggage free of charge. The loading and unloading of goods will also be handled in the same way.

Regarding the Shanghai-Ningbo Direct Voyage Issue

Regarding the issue of direct Shanghai-Ningbo voyages, according to news from the shipping industry yesterday, various fellow villagers' associations in Zhejiang East and shipping companies operating in Zhejiang East all hope that the authorities will approve it as soon as possible to facilitate travel and smooth cargo transportation. However, it has not yet been approved by the authorities. Whether it will be approved in the future is currently uncertain. However, the approval of direct voyages for cargo ships is more promising than for passenger ships. As for the temporary special permission for the Moufu vessel to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou and then from Wenzhou to Ningbo to load goods, it is temporary and not permanent. That vessel is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Wenzhou and then to Ningbo for the second time today. Now, before the authorities approve it, shipping merchants have decided to comply with the order to suspend direct Shanghai-Ningbo voyages.

Four Vessels Temporarily Stop at Wanding, Dinghai

The foreign vessels Shantai, Hana, Haifu, Tangbei, and Gaodeng, which operate on the Shanghai-Taizhou line and also call at Wanding and Dinghai, have been ordered to stop calling at Wanding and Dinghai, and now use Haimen or Shibu as their final destinations. The vessels are currently rushing to complete re-registration procedures. According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the Tenth Army Group Commander has allowed the above vessels to call at Wanding and Dinghai again. After the approval document is delivered to the Ningbo City Defense Commander, they can resume operations. Currently, the foreign vessels operating in Dinghai are the Tianbao, Libao, and Tangsai and Meida on the Yongding line. A total of four vessels temporarily suspended operations due to the incident in Dinghai. They will resume operations after order in Dinghai is restored.

Haimen Formulates Inspection Measures

The Haimen Port Inspection Joint Implementation Measures: (1) These measures were jointly discussed and formulated by the Haimen Martial Law Inspection Office, Taizhou Goods Import and Export Inspection Office, Third District Anti-Smuggling Office, Cigarette Management Office, Consolidated Tax Inspection Office, Linhai Japanese Goods Inspection Team, and other agencies. (2) Before each ship enters or exits the port, the inspectors dispatched by each agency must gather in front of the Martial Law Inspection Office and go together for inspection. However, agencies unrelated to the duties may not send inspectors. (3) When inspectors implement inspections, they must bring the badges or armbands of their respective agencies or other inspection tools for identification. (4) After the inspectors arrive at the port, they will be divided into two groups, one group to board the ship to inspect people and goods, and one group to inspect luggage on the shore. Each group will implement inspections according to the inspection rules of their original agency. (5) After the boarding inspectors have completed their tasks, they must all disembark at the same time and must not loiter privately, except in cases of special circumstances. (6) If the inspectors find any contraband, tax-evading smuggled goods, or Japanese goods, they must detain the people and goods together, register them at the Martial Law Inspection Office, and then take them back to their respective competent agencies for handling according to the law. (7) These measures will be implemented from today. If there are any omissions, a joint meeting may be convened at any time to revise them.

Ningbo Jinhua Joint Transport Service

For the convenience of travel, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau is organizing direct transport service between Jinhua and Hengzhang (15 kilometers from Ningbo). Wu Yanqing, the acting manager of the Yin-Feng Long-Distance Bus Company, has reached an agreement with the province. The Provincial Highway Bureau and the Yin-Feng Bus Company will jointly operate the service. To ensure the energy of the drivers and the safety along the way, the direct transport service will be changed to joint transport service, with Changle in Sheng County as the exchange point. It is reported that it will be implemented starting from the 15th of this month.

### Former French Commander-in-Chief in China, General Destrac, Returns to France, Military Officers Stationed in Shanghai Host Farewell Banquet

According to the French Shanghai Daily, General Destrac, the former Commander-in-Chief of the French Defense Forces in China, will return to his country tomorrow (the 5th) on the French postal ship "Nadette." It is reported that last night (the 3rd), French military officers stationed in Shanghai held a farewell party to send him off.

### How to Pay Business Income Tax: Results of Research by Banking Association, Three Proposed Methods for Reference

The business income tax of each bank is required to be reported and paid within three months after the annual settlement. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, each bank has been affected by the war and suffered losses in the war zone, which have not yet been fully determined, resulting in many failures to complete the procedures as scheduled. The government, noting that most banks have not paid overdue taxes, has instructed the industry association to inform each bank to complete the reporting and payment procedures as soon as possible. The association, considering the actual difficulties of each bank, sent letters to each bank to solicit opinions, collected actual situations, and entrusted the practical research association of the Banking Society to discuss it in order to obtain an appropriate method for the industry to consider and adopt. After a multi-decision meeting, the research has yielded results, and the letter has been sent to the association for reference. The research results are as follows:

After multi-decision discussion by the practical research association of the case, it is believed that each bank suffered significant losses last year due to the war. The exact amount of property losses in a part of the war zone cannot be investigated. Therefore, the difficulty in preparing the final accounts is understandable. From the perspective of the banks, if they can wait until the war is over and the exact amount of losses is determined before reporting and paying taxes, it is still reasonable. However, some banks have already prepared final accounts and are ready to report and pay taxes. Therefore, they should report and pay taxes immediately. The results of the research show that the current situation of each bank is not entirely the same, so the methods adopted are naturally difficult to unify. Currently, each bank's preparation of final accounts is divided into those that have been prepared and those that have not been prepared. For those that have been prepared, the net profit exceeds 5% of the actual capital and those that do not exceed it. If the net profit exceeds 5% of the actual capital, the business income tax to be paid is also less than the already deducted income tax on public debt interest, and there is no need to pay. Therefore, in fact, it is difficult for each industry to take a unified approach. Several methods are proposed: (1) According to Article 168 of the Company Law, the annual final accounts must be approved by the shareholders' meeting. However, Article 2 of the Provisional Measures for Maintaining Profit-Making Legal Persons during Extraordinary Periods, promulgated on April 23 of this year, stipulates that the convening of shareholders' meetings and the re-election of supervisors of profit-making legal persons in or near the war zone may be postponed. Therefore, all banks that have prepared final accounts but have not yet been approved by the shareholders' meeting may postpone the reporting of total income tax on the grounds that they have not been approved by the shareholders' meeting. (2) For those whose final accounts for the 26th year have been completed and approved by the shareholders' meeting, if the percentage of their net profit to the actual capital is less than 5%, according to Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, they should be exempt from paying business income tax. Furthermore, according to Article 15 of the First Category Collection Instructions, even if the net profit exceeds 5% of the actual capital, the tax payable can be offset against the previously deducted income tax on public debt interest. In fact, it may not be necessary to pay again. However, according to Article 19 of the First Category Income Tax Collection Instructions, it is still necessary to fill in a form and submit it for review. (3) For those whose final accounts for the 26th year have been prepared, but the exact amount of losses in the war zone has not yet been determined, resulting in inaccurate final accounts, the method is A. Wait until the losses in the war zone are determined before reporting and paying taxes. The exact amount of losses last year has not yet been determined, so the prepared final accounts cannot be accurate. If this is used as the tax standard, it is unfair. Therefore, after the situation is stabilized and the investigation is accurate, the tax will be verified and paid. B. Report and pay according to the provisional net profit. After the actual amount of losses is determined, complete the procedures for tax refund or supplementary tax payment. (1) Regarding the loss of property, although the loss of property in the war zone cannot be determined, the income tax may be temporarily reported and paid according to the net profit calculated according to the estimated amount. After the actual amount is determined, complete the procedures for tax refund or supplementary tax payment. (2) Regarding the elimination of bad debts, last year was affected by the war, so the bad debt provisions made can be regarded as actual losses in calculating net profit.

### Government Actively Assists, Inland Industry Advances Vigorously, New Methods Used to Mine Coal in Southwest, Foundation for Chemical Industry Also Being Laid

In order to promote the industrial construction of various provinces in the interior, meet the needs of the people's livelihood, and support the long-term resistance war, the National Government has actively implemented the predetermined plan for more than a year, and has achieved remarkable results. Regarding iron production, a large-scale iron and steel plant has been planned and established under the leadership of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, preparing for mass production. The factory's construction is scheduled to be completed this autumn. In addition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is assisting several private companies to engage in production. The coal production in the southwestern provinces is very rich, but the mining mostly adheres to the old methods, resulting in very low output. Now, new equipment has been added separately to mine with new methods, and it is expected to be successful in a short period of time, and the fuel supply can be enriched. Chemical industries, such as acid production, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, ammonia, etc., are also planned, and the Yongli Company, which has experience in handling this type of industry, is invited to assist in the handling, in order to lay the foundation for the chemical industry. Hydropower undertakings are also being promoted. We also actively assist the silk and paper industries to increase production. As for private factories, they are now being assisted in relocating to the interior one after another, and some of them have begun to resume production at the designated locations. With government encouragement, cotton production has greatly increased.

### Central Government Cooperates with HSBC to Stabilize Exchange Rate in Open Market, Although Transactions Have Increased Compared to the Past, Exchange Rate Fluctuations Are Minimal, Open Market Price No Longer Accurate Market Price

The open market exchange rate in Shanghai (i.e., the black market) has increased sharply since the implementation of the import permit system. The reason for this is that some merchants have no way to apply for foreign exchange from the Central Bank, and general speculators take the opportunity to manipulate it. The current open market price is 40% lower than the legal price. However, today's Shanghai has lost its position as the national financial center. In addition, under special circumstances, its open market price is no longer an accurate market price. Since the Central Bank cooperated with HSBC to be responsible for stabilization, the exchange rate fluctuations have been minimal. Recently, since the success of the Sino-British and Sino-American loans, the exchange rate has turned for the better. The open market exchange rates for the past few months are recorded as follows: (1) British exchange rate: April, highest one shilling one penny five six two five, lowest one shilling zero three one two five; May, highest one shilling zero nine three seven five, lowest ten pence three seven five; June, highest ten pence three seven five, lowest eight pence; July, highest nine pence zero one five six two five, lowest eight pence three seven five; August, highest eight pence five six two five, lowest seven pence eight seven five; September, highest eight pence eight one two five, lowest eight pence half; October, highest eight pence half, lowest eight pence. (2) US exchange rate: April, highest 28.25 yuan, lowest 25.5 yuan; May, highest 26.875 yuan, lowest 21.475 yuan; June, highest 21.375 yuan, lowest 16.5625 yuan; July, highest 18.5 yuan, lowest 17.125 yuan; August, highest 17.375 yuan, lowest 16.125 yuan; September, highest 18 yuan, lowest 17 yuan; October, highest 17.125 yuan, lowest 15.78125 yuan.

### Relief Expenses for Refugees Actively Soliciting Donations, Soy Sauce Industry Assists in Soliciting Donations, Association Adds Solicitation Committee Members

In order to assist in soliciting donations for refugee relief expenses, the soy sauce industry in this city has hired Fan Dongsheng, Lu Junyue, Yu Hongwen, Zhang Yunyuan, Zhang Jiasheng, Hu Benxin, Chen Jiefu, Yu Rupin, Shen Weiya, Zhang Zhaokang, Chen Zhenlin, Shen Jiaxing, Hu Shiqing, Tang Qingxiang, Shen Zhaokang, Ye Dechang, and sixteen others as solicitation committee members. After organizing the solicitation committee, they held a meeting yesterday to discuss the implementation methods. Fang Jiaobo, the director of the association's solicitation committee, attended and the following resolutions were made: (1) Elect Fan Dongsheng as the chairman of the committee, Zhang Jiefu, Zhang Jiasheng, and Hu Benxin as standing committee members. (2) The fundraising method will be based on the number of sales of urns, with an increase of 50 cents in national currency for each group, to be used as funds for refugee relief. (3) The association will formulate forms and notify all industries to fill in the numbers, with the sales amount for December of last year as the standard. (4) It is scheduled to be implemented on January 16th, and the association will publish a public announcement in the newspaper.

Relief Association Adds Committee Members

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has now added the following solicitation committee members: Xie Xigui, Zhang Shide, Hu Gengpei, and Li Zifeng from the glasses industry; Jin Shanxin, Dong Zixing, Zhou Linxiang, Mao Wenrong, Hu Qaqin, and Zhuang Zhihe from the watch industry.

Fifteen Solicitation Teams Hold Meeting Record

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the 15th Solicitation Team of the Citizens' Group held a joint meeting of deputy team leaders and all executive committee members of the 31st Sub-Association at the meeting place of the 31st Sub-Association of Citizens. Zheng Fangbo, Fei Liangheng, Yu Yaoqing, Tang Linsheng, Li Jiafu, Chen Zaiyang, and over twenty others were present. Song Shixiang, the team leader, was elected as the temporary chairman to discuss refugee relief and promotion of solicitation methods. The following resolutions were made: (1) Distribute announcements to stores and households on this road, asking them to donate as they see fit. (2) This team should obtain donation forms from the solicitation committee of the citizens' group for filling out to various stores and households. The team does not handle the collection of funds. (3) The team leader and deputy team leaders, and all executive committee members of this association will set off in batches to solicit donations from door to door. (4) If there are enthusiastic gentlemen on this road who are willing to join this team, please send a letter to this sub-association, which will be welcome, or please introduce them through various deputy team leaders and executive committee members. (5) Song Shixiang introduced Li Wencai of No. 3 Wanxiang Lane on this road as the deputy team leader of this team.

Solicitation Achievements Published in Booklet for Credibility

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Citizens' Group Solicitation Committee has been soliciting donations for refugees by broadcasting, which has been enthusiastically participated in by caring people from all walks of life, achieving good results. In order to show credibility, the association is compiling a crediting record for distribution to all walks of life to promote benevolent virtues. The paper and printing costs required for this crediting record have been donated by Dong Hefu, a kind person from Mao Fu Foreign Firm, through Zhou Bangjun, a standing committee member of the association. Dong Zhuomao, a kind person from Huifeng Paper Store, has donated the printing. The association has sent letters to thank both benefactors.

Wuxi Benefactor Participates in Adoption

The Citizens' Group Solicitation Committee's campaign to solicit donations for the adoption of refugees has been enthusiastically participated in by caring people from all walks of life in this city. Du Meibao, a kind person from Daoghang Lane in Wuxi, learned of this adoption campaign from the newspaper and generously adopted a refugee for half a year. Yesterday, he sent the adoption fee of 12 yuan through the post office. The association has sent a reply to thank Mr. Du for his enthusiastic support for the city's relief work, even though he is in another city.

Saving Meal Expenses to Adopt Refugees

The organization of the Pujiji Meal Association in this city is entirely charitable. The organizers are Chen Shaozhang and others. They hold a meal gathering once a month. The association, in view of the fact that refugees are victims of the country and suffer from their lives, has been allocating funds to charitable organizations every month from the meal expenses to cover relief expenses for a long time. Now, the association has determined that the Citizens' Group's advocacy of the refugee adoption campaign is a very practical and sustainable method. It has specifically decided to adopt 50 refugees per month starting from January of this year, saving 100 yuan in national currency from the meal expenses each month to be used as the living expenses for 50 refugees. The funds for January have been sent to the Citizens' Group for receipt. Their enthusiasm is admirable. It has been found that there are many meal gathering organizations in this city. If they can consistently save money and assist refugees as the association does, they will be able to achieve significant relief effects.

### Petty Thieves Rampant in Western Shanghai, Concession's Strict Precautions, Authorities Determined to Maintain Security, Strict Suppression of Traitors Hidden

The Public Concession authorities, in order to rectify security and protect the safety of residents in the western Shanghai concession area due to rampant smoking dens, gambling, and bandits in the road construction area, have set up barbed wire obstacles at the key entrances and exits of the area to cut off traffic and strictly prevent them. Unexpectedly, the patrol car of the Jing'an Temple Police Station was shot at by thugs in the dark while patrolling Dunxin Road the other night. The police authorities considered the matter serious. In addition to stepping up precautions, since yesterday, they have added several large teams of armed detectives to patrol in shifts day and night. On the one hand, they have also secretly deployed detectives around the smoking dens and gambling tables. Anyone with suspicious behavior will be detained and searched. They are also afraid that unscrupulous traitors will hide in these areas or privately hide contraband. Therefore, all the houses inhabited by the people of Western Shanghai will also be investigated when necessary to ensure the safety of the concession. Therefore, the situation in Western Shanghai for the past two months has been extremely tense. Armed patrols are endless, which has never been seen before.

Gunfire Sounds, Four People Run Away

The English Great Beauty Evening News reported that this morning (the 4th), four Chinese men ran along Dunxin Road, ignoring the patrol officers' order to stop, thus becoming the target of the patrolling patrol officers. A total of four shots were fired at the suspects, but they were obviously ineffective. The details are as follows: A squad of patrol officers from the Jing'an Temple Police Station was walking along Dunxin Road. At about 3:00 AM, they heard a gunshot from somewhere on the roadside. A few seconds later, they saw four Chinese men running away. The patrol officers ordered them to stop and prepared to shoot. However, the four Chinese men suddenly hid in a side alley and moved quickly. The patrol officers quickly fired four shots at them, but the four men had disappeared into the darkness. A large number of patrol officers and White Russian merchants patrolled the roads in the area all night. In addition to the bandits, they encountered another danger. Last night, near the five-corner square on Jessfield Road, a patrol officer was knocked down by a car and suffered a concussion.

Bandits Attack Patrol Police Car

The night before last at 9:30 PM, a patrol police car of the Public Concession on Dunxin Road was suddenly attacked by bandits. The detectives in the car immediately returned fire. In the case where the bandits began to flee, it is now learned that the Central Police Station has arrested one wounded bandit. After questioning and confession yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, the police took the arrested bandit to the Tiandesen Wine Shop at No. 420 Fahua East Town (the house is a temporary wooden house), where they arrested four men and three women, totaling seven people. Later, it was learned that the bandits had three pistols, which they sank in the Fahua River. The detectives then searched and recovered one pistol and confiscated an iron bar in the house. Together with the arrested criminals, they were taken to the Central Police Station for interrogation. However, two pistols have not yet been recovered. It is planned to order people to fish them out again today.

### Silver and Money Trades: Resumption of Business Today, Variously Shaped Development in All Sectors, Banks All Profitable

Member banks and money shops of the Shanghai Silver and Money Trades Association, having completed their New Year's holiday, are all scheduled to resume business today. The Shanghai market is developing in a unique way, bank settlements are showing profits, and the business policy for this year is determined to be based on consolidating one's own foundation and supporting the development of various industries. All industrial and commercial sectors are preparing for the annual general closing. The details of each situation are recorded below.

Banks and Money Shops Resume Business Today

Member banks of the Bankers Association, the Joint Reserve Committee of Voice Banks, the Bankers' Acceptance House, the Clearing House, as well as member money shops of the Occupational Association, the Money Trade Reserve, the Money Trade Market, and various financial markets such as cash, public bonds, miscellaneous grains, cotton yarn, cloth, foreign exchange, and discounting, all took a four-day holiday for the New Year. This period has now ended, and it is scheduled to uniformly enter the market today, conduct business as usual, and resume office work.

Year-End Settlements All Profitable

Various banks are handling the final settlements for the year 1938. A portion of these settlements were completed before New Year's Eve, while another portion was rushed to completion during the holiday. The results all show considerable profits. The figures for the past two or three years have been reported to the Bankers Association for compilation and publication. This year, due to the war, and the fact that most government and commercial banks, such as the head offices of the Bank of Communications, have relocated inland, with Shanghai only being a branch, the profit figures for each bank this year are not yet determined for public release.

Business Policy Strives for Stability

The business policy of various banks in Shanghai has been to adopt a prudent approach since the outbreak of the war. They have been quite cautious with various loans. Moreover, the population of Shanghai has increased after the war, the demand for goods exceeds supply, and factories are operating day and night to rush production, creating a uniquely developed phenomenon. The market has suddenly become active, so the funds released before and after the war can be recovered as scheduled. The business policy of each bank this year is also determined to be based on consolidating its own position, supporting the development of industrial and commercial sectors, utilizing funds, and assisting the government in developing the southwest, to increase wealth.

Various Sectors Prepare for General Closing

The period for the year-end general closing of various industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai has always relied on the money trade. The general closing period for the money trade has traditionally been Lunar New Year's Eve. This year, Lunar New Year's Eve is February 18th. The money trade has decided to conduct its general closing on this day. Various industrial and commercial sectors are also preparing for this by planning ahead, actively promoting business, and because the local production in various guerrilla areas is on the verge of collapse, they are all flocking to Shanghai to purchase goods. Therefore, the business of various sectors is particularly prosperous. This year's general closing is determined to be able to be passed safely.

### West District Car Robbery Case Cracked, Thirteen Criminals Captured

Public Concession police, yesterday, together with Japanese military police, searched villages and towns in the western district of Shanghai. As a result, several bandits who robbed a foreigner's car a few days ago were all captured. The arrested include ten men and three women. Several pistols were also seized, one of which belonged to a Municipal Council police officer and was robbed in recent weeks. During the search, the police surrounded the newly built houses along the Suzhou River. The bandits attempted to escape, and the police fired automatic rifles and machine guns, but there were no casualties.

### Hundreds of Dock Workers Request Relief, Renji Hall Unable to Accommodate, Relief Association Trying to Find a Solution

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, cargo transportation in Shanghai has declined. Nantong and Guangzhou have fallen, and Ningbo and Dinghai have restricted the entry of ships, making it even more difficult for a group of workers who rely on cargo packages at the docks for a living. Apart from barely managing to eat, their clothes are tattered. Even in the severe cold weather, they still wear summer clothes and sleep on the streets and alleys at night, as well as in small barges along the river. Since the beginning of winter, several people have been frozen to death in the Bund area every day. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., hundreds of dock workers, with a signed petition, gathered at the entrance of Renji Hall and elected five representatives to enter and request relief. The reception department of Renji Hall received them, but due to financial difficulties, they were unable to accommodate them. The representatives then went to the Refugee Relief Association, requesting to be received by the person in charge of the association. They were promised that they would try to find a solution. They then withdrew and informed the workers to disperse.

### Ding Xisan Inspects Defense of Various Counties, Provincial Government Restores Administrative Institutions, Appoints County Magistrates and Assigns Commissioners

Previously, the Japanese army invaded Pudong and, after more than ten days of resistance by the Chinese mobile troops, suffered heavy losses. As a result, they returned empty-handed. Therefore, there are now very few traces of the Japanese army in various places in Fengxian and Nanhui. However, Ding Xisan, the commander of the 8th Detachment of the Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army, believes that the current expansion and distribution of his subordinates along the

Jiangsu and Zhejiang Coasts

as well as the Fengxian, Nanhui, Songhu area, after this battle, should be reorganized and improved to facilitate offense and defense. He recently inspected various places, including Tinglin, Zhangyan, Songyin, Yexie in the west, and Lujiahui, Hangtou, Li灶, Xinchang in the east, Zhapu, Hujiaqiao, Qingcun Port, Nanhui, Zhuanqiao, and Wujiaxiang along the Pu River in the suburbs of Shanghai in the south, spanning six or seven counties. He has redeployed the troops in various places and requested instructions from his superiors to determine new offensive and defensive strategies for future opportune offensives. As for

Nearby Counties

the Jiangsu Provincial Government has now restored administrative institutions, appointed county magistrates, with Cai Renxi as the county magistrate of Shanghai County and concurrently the Administrative Inspector Commissioner, Li Leng as the county magistrate of Songjiang, Ruan Kaiji for Fengxian, Yu Taosheng for Nanhui, Tang Yaoyu for Chuansha, and Bao Buchao as the commissioner separately established for Pudong. Evidenced by the above situation, the suburbs are almost entirely under the control of the Chinese army.

### Professor Kang Huandong's Steadfast Aspirations

Professor Kang Huandong is a veteran of the Chinese judicial community. Several years ago, he left his official career and came to Shanghai to teach at China Public School, Great China University, Fudan University, Political Science College, Law School, and other schools. He often used moral integrity and aspirations as his teachings and was highly respected by students. He is currently still teaching at the Law School and Great China University. A clarification notice from the professor was suddenly seen in the newspaper a few days ago. Yesterday, his friends specially visited Kang to inquire about this matter. The professor sincerely told them, "I have served in the political arena for decades, and there are countless colleagues and old friends. At this time of turmoil, it is inevitable that some acquaintances are listed as 'new nobles'. Some short-sighted people, not examining the reality, only see my old friends among the 'new nobles' and mistakenly believe that I can also change my aspirations. This kind of pointless speculation arises from this. They do not know that I read the Spring and Autumn Annals in my youth and deeply understand the great principles. Therefore, in addition to teaching, I often cite the personalities of those who in ancient times were loyal to the people to inspire students' integrity in this time of national crisis. This can be asked of all the students I teach. Now, I am frail and ill and cannot actively serve to save the nation from danger, which is already a matter of regret. How can I do things that are harmful to the nation? I tell you now, even if I lose my job in the future and fall into poverty, I would rather die of hunger and cold than change my original aspirations." The professor's tone was passionate and his demeanor was serious. The reporter paid his respects and left.

### Iron Factory Owner Extortion Case, Criminals Awaiting Detailed Investigation, Criminals Confess Iron Factory Owner Sells Iron to the Enemy, Confession Made Regarding Huang Jisheng Case

Zhu Zhongsheng, a 35-year-old man from Chuansha, residing at 312 Rue Latreille in the French Concession, recently impersonated a guerrilla commander and sent a letter to Room 531 of the Zhonghui Building in the French Concession, extorting 20,000 yuan from Huang Peng (currently residing in Henry Lane, formerly operating an iron factory in Nanshi). The two parties met at Room 104 of the Weida Hotel on Avenue Joffre. As a result of the negotiations, it was resolved with 5,000 yuan. Public bond tickets worth 1,000 yuan were used for payment. Now Zhu's father sent a letter to 358 Rue Fulu, to Huang Jisheng's home

Plotting to Extort a Large Sum

Unsuccessfully. This was discovered by the French Police Department, which dispatched detectives at 2 p.m. on December 30th of last year. First, Bao Chongzhen, a man from Pudong, was arrested in Room 15 of the Dalai Hotel on Rue Gascogne, and a 1,000 yuan public bond ticket was found. Then, the main culprit Zhu Zhongsheng and related persons Zhou Junmei (30 years old, from Jiading), Zhang Yaozhong (21 years old, from Pudong), Zhang Guojun (28 years old, from Pudong), Zhang Amao (30 years old, from Pudong), Zhang Fengxiang (32 years old, from Pudong), etc. were successively arrested, and

Handguns Seized

One handgun, two hand grenades, and drafts of threatening letters, stationery symbols, etc. in a large leather suitcase were taken back to the police station for investigation. The details have been briefly reported in the newspaper. Yesterday, the police station escorted the defendants and others to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division 1, where Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated them. According to the attorney Gu Shouxi, representing the French Concession administrative authorities, the police department needs to conduct a detailed investigation of the case of the defendants' intimidation and extortion, and requested that the defendants be detained and the case investigated at a later date.

Request to Hear the Case

Following this, detectives reported the process of solving the case. When Zhu Zhongsheng was questioned, he confessed that because Huang Peng was a big traitor and sold steel to the enemy for profit, he extorted 5,000 yuan from him. Although he went to Huang Jisheng three times to threaten him and attached two bullets to the letter, asking him for 50,000 yuan, he gave up because he found no evidence that Huang was a traitor. Bao Chongzhen confessed that Zhu Zhongsheng owed him 200 yuan, and now he used the 1,000 yuan public bond ticket as compensation, and he did not know that it was obtained through intimidation and

Extorted Funds

The people did not participate in the intimidation. Zhang Yaozhong confessed that he worked for Zhu Zhongsheng, and the threatening letter was written by Zhou Junmei, but it was just to warn them. When questioned, Zhou admitted to writing the letter. Zhang Amao, Zhang Fengxiang, Zhang Guojun, etc. confessed that they were friends with Zhu and went to visit him that day. They did not know about the extortion. Judge Zhang verified the confession and ruled that the hearing would be postponed to January 18. The defendants were taken back into custody.

### Six Puppets Compete to Be Town Head

In the Pudong area along the Pu River, the puppet "municipal government" is cooperating with the Japanese Marine Corps to promote a puppet "autonomous system" in an attempt to deceive the public. They have established puppet "town offices" in various towns and are looking for small puppets to fill the role of puppet "town head." It is learned that in Changzhan Town, there are now six traitors competing for the position of puppet "town head." (1) Fan Futang, the puppet "Self-Praising Corps Commander"; (2) Yao Jinxiang, the puppet "Self-Defense Corps Deputy Commander"; (3) Chen Zhusheng, formerly a Baochang; (4) Ma Yigen, a translator for the 5th Battalion of the Japanese Navy, who used to be a tailor in Japan; (5) Chuan Azhu, also a translator for the 5th Battalion of the Japanese Navy, who came from the same background as Ma; (6) Gu Liangsi, who opened the Gu Liangji Shrewd Hospital in Shiba Jian, and is also the puppet "Maintenance Association Chairman" of Shiba Jian. Among these six people, the first three are backed by the 3rd Battalion of the Navy, and the last three are protected by the 5th Battalion of the Japanese Navy. They are all doing their best to compete, hosting banquets in turn, inviting Japanese and puppet officials to feast. Because the forces of both sides are equal, it has not yet been possible to produce a result. The outcome of who will win is unknown. The outside world is paying close attention to this ridiculous farce.

### Private Counterfeit Cigarette Manufacturing Operation Cracked on Wuding Road, Internal False Walls and Fake Doors, Layers of Secret Chambers, Confiscated Counterfeit Cigarettes and Accomplices

The Public Concession Police Department suddenly received a confidential report on the morning of the first day of the new year that someone had secretly set up a cigarette manufacturing operation inside No. 921 Wuding Road, Maigen Road, imitating the products of the British American Tobacco Company, requesting to crack the case. After receiving the report, the Police Department immediately ordered the Central Police Station to dispatch a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to secretly arrest them at the address. The layout of the operation was extremely elaborate, mysterious, and unpredictable. Entering it was like entering a maze. Fortunately, the detectives were quick and agile, and they were able to explore their way in. They saw false walls and fake doors everywhere in the rooms. After searching for a while, they finally managed to enter the machine room, where more than ten workers were working diligently beside the machines. They were immediately arrested. Then, they ordered the workers to lead them into the storeroom and office, where they found several molds of counterfeit Da Ying, Pin Hai, and Lao Dao brand cigarette boxes, 100,000 counterfeit cigarettes that had been rolled, as well as countless tobacco, advertisements, flyers, etc. They were then moved out one by one, and the cigarette-making machines were dismantled. Together with the 13 suspects captured, they were taken back to the police station. After a brief interrogation, they were temporarily detained, awaiting escort to the court for investigation. A search is underway for the main culprit to thoroughly investigate the inside story.

### Japanese Army in Tonghai Makes Moves, Fierce Fighting for Days, Nearly 100 Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded

Yesterday, a gentleman came to Shanghai from Haimen, talked about the guerrilla warfare situation in Tonghai, and I quickly recorded it to inform the fellow villagers in Shanghai. (1) Recently, the Japanese army in Tonghai launched attacks in multiple directions, claiming to clear the countryside, and using the newly completed South Trunk Road as a key route for troop movement, riding in cars, armored vehicles, trucks, and horses, carrying new-style weapons, and rushing around all day long to create a false show of strength. One route advanced along Guanyin Mountain and Sanxu Town, another route attacked Xiting Jinsha from Kan Jia'an, and another route attacked from Ba Chang and Luhongzha. On the Haimen side, one route has already occupied the county seat, and another route attacked Sijiaba in Nantong County. County Magistrate Peng led his elite troops to intercept them separately. After several days of fierce fighting, Yuxi, Jiangzao Port, Sanxu Town, Xiting, Dongshe, and Erjia Town have been recovered. Jinsha was once recovered, but is now recaptured by the enemy. The southern Xiaohai Town and Chuan Port Town are also stationed with enemy troops, and residents are fleeing to the surrounding countryside. (2) The Japanese army harassing Sijiaba is said to be taking a shortcut to attack Jiulong Town. Peng's troops are now joining forces with allied troops to guard Qian to the west of Sijiaba and jointly encircle the enemy in Dongling. At the same time, they are starting to destroy the South Trunk Road. According to intelligence, in the continuous battles, more than 20 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded in Sijiaba. There are more than 40 wounded being transported from Yuxi Jinsha to Tangzha, including three squad leaders. The Japanese army in Tangzha held a meeting to mourn them. Our army also suffered considerable losses. (3) The new County Magistrate of Haimen, Sun Xinfu, has not yet taken office. People from Haimen in Shanghai are hoping that Sun will be able to refresh the county administration, unify command, and recover the Japanese army's strongholds in Sanchang City as soon as possible, so that the order of the whole county can be gradually restored.

### Transportation Company Owner Accused of Fraudulently Obtaining Money, Falsely Reporting Quantity of Transported Machines, Fraudulently Obtaining Freight Charges, Imprisonment for Three Months

Meiheng Textile Co., Ltd., located at 207 Tianjin Road, has its main factory in Wuxi. Since the outbreak of the war and the westward movement of the National Army, Wuxi has fallen. All the machines in the factory were not moved out in time. On December 12th of last year, Xu Juchang, a representative of Meiheng Factory, wanted to find a way to transport the machines out of the Wuxi factory, so he consulted with Sun Jianshi, the owner of Haima Transportation Company, located at 14th Museum Road, who was from Wuxi.

Entrusting Transportation

At that time, it was agreed that the freight for each dan of machine would be 3 yuan, 8 jiao, and an advance payment of 4,250 yuan would be made. Until December 30th of last year, Sun Jianshi of Haima Transportation Company notified Meiheng Textile Company that all the machines that had been transported out were 3,400 dans, totaling 12,920 yuan. In addition to the advance payment received, 8,670 yuan was still owed. At that time, Xu Xuechang, a representative of Meiheng, paid 8,000 yuan, and the remaining 670 yuan was waived, as a settlement. However, after Meiheng found that only 2,523 dans of machines had been transported out, a shortage of 877 dans, Sun Jianshi had

Falsely Reported Numbers

Fraudulently obtained more than 2,000 yuan. After repeated negotiations, they were unsuccessful. Xu Xuechang then hired two lawyers, Qian Zheng and Yao Junyu, to report to the General Police Department, which ordered Chinese detectives Kang Zengxiang and Zhou Zhenxing to arrest Sun Jianshi and search Sun's bedroom, Room 30, Lianyuan Inn, 666 Hankou Road, and seize 1,600 yuan in legal tender. All were taken back to the police station for detention. This morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court 4 of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyers Zhang Shizhu and Jiang Baolian, in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law,

Fraudulently Obtained Money

filed charges, and stated the above situation and requested an investigation. Subsequently, the plaintiff's attorneys, Qian Zheng and Yao Junyu, rose to state that the case had already been settled out of court, so they requested leniency for the defendant. When questioned, the defendant Sun Jianshi confessed, "I transported the machines of Meiheng, and in total, it was many trips back and forth from Wuxi to Shanghai. The first two trips were all weighed, but the third trip was due to

Special Circumstances

in Wuxi, and in a hurry, they were loaded onto a large transport ship to Shanghai, and together with the staff of Meiheng, the weight was slightly skipped. However, because the cost of this trip was greater than the previous two, I asked the plaintiff to increase the freight. Unexpectedly, he reported it to the police station, and I was arrested. I really had no intention of deliberately falsely reporting the quantity to defraud the freight." Judge Fang verified the confession and sentenced Xu Xuechang to fraud, imprisonment for three months, allowed to be released on bail of 500 yuan, and the confiscated legal tender was returned to the plaintiff for collection.

Ge Mingsheng was found by a patrol officer and summoned an ambulance to the Shanghai East Hospital for treatment. At noon that day, the victim Xu Fangfu returned home and only then learned that he had been robbed. Not knowing that it was his cousin Xu Fangqing who had released the dragon, he had to report to the Yangshupu Police Station based on the intelligence. The Chinese detectives Jin Wanrong, Liu Changgen, and Lu Yisheng investigated and learned that the inner thread of the case was his cousin Xu Fangqing, who at noon yesterday

Arrested His Cousin First

confessed his accomplices, Ju Yuhu, Liu Shunliang, Wang Asan, Chen Deliang, Yuan Jiulin, and others. They secretly went to the Shenxin No. 6 Factory on Hejian Road, arrested them all, and took them to the police station for detention. This morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court 3 of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin elaborated on the details of the case, and learned that Ge Mingsheng, one of the robbers, was seriously injured in the hospital and his life was in danger. He requested a postponement. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the defendants and ordered them to be taken back into custody and re-examined at a later date.

### Dispute over Shortage of Coal Balls Leads to Fatal Case, Old Steward Dies Tragically from Mistakenly Taking Injury Medicine

Chen Fuyuan, a 31-year-old man from Yuyao, was an old steward in a certain coal shop on Parker Road. The day before yesterday afternoon, he was ordered by the shop to deliver a load of coal balls to No. 9, Hongan Lane, Haining Road. At that time, the female owner of the house saw that the coal balls in the load seemed different, so she questioned him and weighed them. Sure enough, there was a shortage. As a result, a dispute arose between the two parties, and neither would give way. The male owner of the house came out and reprimanded Chen. Chen did not respond, which led to a mutual fight. In the end, they were dispersed by others. In the evening, Chen suddenly felt pain in his waist, fearing that he had been beaten. The shop owner bought him a dose of injury medicine and told him to take it and sleep. Unexpectedly, after midnight, his condition suddenly worsened and he was in great pain. His shop friends saw that his complexion had changed and feared the worst, so they quickly sent him to the hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, he died in the hospital due to mistakenly taking the injury medicine, and there was no way to save him. The hospital reported the case to the police station, and the body was sent to the morgue for examination.

Upon inspecting the losses, it was discovered that the robbers had stolen a significant amount of clothing, cash, and jewelry. A detailed list of the stolen items was immediately submitted to the local police station, requesting them to investigate and apprehend the culprits.

An urgent report was made to the police station, who then notified the fire brigade. A rescue vehicle was dispatched to the scene, and efforts were made to sift through the debris. As a result, the body of a man, approximately 40 years old, who had been crushed to death by the collapsed house, was pulled out. It was believed that he was a resident of the house, but due to the mangled state of the body, it was difficult to identify him. The body was first sent to the hospital for cleaning before being transferred to the coroner's office, pending examination by the court.

### Dr. Yu Nai'an Discusses Reasons for Smallpox Epidemic

Recently, smallpox has been prevalent in this city, with many infants being infected. Even adults who have been vaccinated once or twice are experiencing recurrences this year. According to Dr. Yu Nai'an, a Shanghai specialist in measles and smallpox (clinic address: No. 1, Lane 2, Liuxian Village, Route Magy, south of the Sino-French School), the severity of the smallpox epidemic this year is rare in the past 30 years. The reasons are that the population of Shanghai has increased, and residents in the interior delay vaccinating their infants. Often, they procrastinate and do not vaccinate until the age of two or three. With the onset of winter and the abnormal weather, the epidemic has spread more widely. It is hoped that residents of this city will pay attention. Whether adults or children, all should be vaccinated once to prevent the disease.

### Gambling Losses, Gang Robbery of Clan Brother, Carrying Loot and Fleeing Encounter Another Gang of Thieves, All Thieves Apprehended and Held for Investigation

Xu Fangfu, a native of Yangzhou residing at No. 84 Puai Fang, Zhoujiapai Road, is a coppersmith at the Electric Light Company and has a modest family income. He lives in the same room with his distant cousin, Xu Fangqing. Recently, Xu Fangqing lost money gambling and developed bad intentions. He discussed robbing his clan brother Xu Fangfu's property with his colleagues from the Shenxin Sixth Factory on Hejian Road, Jiangbei natives Ju Yuhu, Liu Shunliang, Wang Asan, Chen Deliang, Yuan Jiulin, and others. Around 9:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th of last month, these people hid two sharp knives in their sleeves and went to attempt the robbery. When they arrived, the gate was closed, and they knocked but no one opened it. Suddenly, a patrolman came from afar, and the group panicked and fled in succession. Around 5:00 AM the next morning, they brought flashlights and went again. They rushed in through the back door. Xu Fangfu had already gone to work at the Electric Light Factory. Ju Yuhu took out a sharp knife and threatened Xu's wife, Wang, forbidding her from making a sound. They robbed a clothing chest and rushed out the door. While traveling near Funing Road on Lan Road, they encountered another gang of five thieves who blocked their path and forced them to open the chest to check what was inside. At first, Ju Yuhu and the others were afraid because the other group had handguns and they could not resist. Then, they saw that there were no firearms, so they took out sharp knives and stabbed Ge Shengming, who was examining the clothes inside the chest, in the buttocks. Chen Deliang also took out a sharp knife and slashed Ge's left chest, causing a serious wound. Ge fell to the ground, dying. The other four members of Ge's gang were shocked and took the opportunity to escape. Ju Yuhu and the other five people carried the clothing chest to the home of their friend Liu Yujing at No. 135 Danyang Road, opened the chest, took out 185 French dollars, and divided the spoils with Xu Fang and dispersed. Later, the injured

### Finance: Shanghai Gold Breaks Through $2,000 Mark, Up $11 Before Closure, Shortage of Chips, Price Easy to Rise

Yesterday, the Shanghai gold cash market, though due to the New Year holiday, the sentiment of all parties became prosperous again due to the sharp rise in British pure gold. The Hong Kong gang's desire to buy gold is also increasing, and they are buying at high prices. Moreover, the city's gold reserves have been exhausted by the Hong Kong gang and Tianjin gang, so the circulating chips have become scarce, and the price has repeatedly risen. According to unofficial prices, it has broken through the $2,000 mark. It is said that a certain money exchange business received dozens of taels from new colleagues at a price of $1,993 (because the color was slightly inferior, it was reduced by several yuan), and then received 30 taels from a customer at a price of $2,000. Another money exchange business searched for more than 100 taels for the Hong Kong gang at prices of $2,000 and $2,003, which were all supplied by colleagues and local gangs.

Ornamental Gold Hangs at $202

Jewelry gold in jewelry stores has not increased during the holidays, and the original price is still suspended. Da Tong Hang hangs at $202, Xin Tong Hang $200 (received at $194-5)

Pure Gold Rises Another 5 Pence

Also, the London electricity on the 3rd, British pure gold has been affected by the sharp contraction of the British exchange rate, so the rising wind is increasing, and each ounce has increased by 5 pence, reaching 7 pounds and 10 and a half pence (a total of 5 pence compared to before the holiday)

### London Silver Bars, Unprecedented Surge, Indian Silver Continues to be High

London electricity on the 3rd, some people covered their positions, the supply was limited, but the entrants felt satisfied. After the market closed, the market was very trance. The recent period was soft, the listed price was 1.875 lower than the price. The forward period was flat and soft. Silver bars recently soared by 1.0625, reaching 21.125. The forward period also rose by half a pence, to 20.125. New York, the price of American silver is still in short supply, and the Mongbai electricity, the Indian silver market is quite buoyant, and the spot price has risen by 3 anna, and the near and far futures have also risen by 2 anna.

### Yarn Flower Prediction Today, Yarn Price Should Have a Good Side, Cotton is also Difficult to See Loose

According to a certain yarn merchant's news yesterday, there is an image of Zhejiang East activity, but yarn merchants are unwilling to sell rashly in this closure, and they must wait for the market to open today to observe the general trend before making a business plan. Therefore, a compromise could not be reached. According to the above situation, today's market price should have a good side. I also heard that 70 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Tianjin, 40 pieces were transported to Yantai, and 5 pieces were transported to Xiamen, 240 pieces were transported to Shantou, 5 pieces were transported to Haikou, and 4 pieces were transported to Beihai. 110 pieces were transported to Haiphong. Also, the cotton market, at the end of last year, all factories were at a standstill, and the market was sluggish, but according to the opinions of most colleagues, the market will be difficult to loosen after the opening. The control of a certain party is very allowed. The price of Su North cotton is quite low, and Myanmar wool is all within the 50 yuan mark. However, the outer transport layer has a troublesome process and is extremely difficult. There are many kinds of miscellaneous taxes, with many items and different categories. There are transit taxes, passes, special taxi taxes, export taxes, in other words, the purpose is to cut money easily. It is said that each burden is added to Shanghai, adding up to fifteen or sixteen yuan, and farmers and merchants are crying incessantly in this environment. Therefore, the selling price of Shendi Tonghua is between sixty-four and five yuan. Yesterday, a large amount of Yaohua was reported to be imported, estimated at more than 10,000 bags, and several thousand bags are still on the way. There is no problem with the market, and all the previous discarded goods have been delivered to the factory in succession. Also, 180 pieces of cotton were transported from Xingang, and 60 pieces were exported to Japan.

### Overseas Consumption Soars: Indian Cotton Reaches New High Since May

Foreign cotton prices: New York cotton market opened with a slight drop of three to five points due to sluggish trading. Later, according to statistical reports, cloth transactions were booming during the holidays, boosting confidence. Simultaneously, due to firm gold prices, brokers, firms, and exporters engaged in large transactions, resulting in a closing price that rose six to seven points higher than before the holiday. In recent days, Indian cotton prices have been rising continuously for many days due to a surge in overseas consumption of Indian cotton, coupled with previous rumors that the Indian government would reduce acreage last year. Consequently, various firms and exporters have been actively purchasing, pushing cotton prices to their highest level since May. This is truly worthy of our countrymen's attention. Egyptian cotton prices are exceptionally weak, falling another six to seven points yesterday. Yesterday was a bank holiday, so there were no exchange rates, and thus no spot market prices.

Local foreign cotton trading was quiet yesterday as most yarn mills were still on holiday. However, all Japanese cotton firms have already resumed operations. Yesterday, the British-owned Lun Chang Dyeing Factory ordered 1,000 bales of lower-grade long-staple American cotton from Fu Jia and Mei An foreign firms, with payment terms of immediate cash upon loading. Due to the bank closures, the purchase was based on gold prices, at 9.5 cents per pound, equivalent to 84 yuan per unit including tax and delivery to the factory.

### Grains: Changshu Coarse Rice Reaches 9.5 Yuan; Shanghai Market Shows Tightening Again; Rice, Wheat, and Grains Are Exported

Yesterday, the source of domestic rice was limited to eight or nine boats of goods from Hexia and one or two thousand packages of military rations. The outlets on this street and in storage yards are not as active as before. However, it is said that after Japanese companies monopolized Changshu and other places, the price of coarse rice unexpectedly soared to 9.45 yuan, equivalent to 12.56 yuan in the Shanghai market. As a result, sellers are very firm and holding on tightly, and the market is showing signs of tightening again. The prices of both thick and thin粳 rice have increased slightly, but only Yangjian rice has a wide distribution, still fetching a premium of one角. Du Yangjian rice is also quite stable, and Yin Yuan rice remains strong due to shortages, while Bian Yuan rice is also tight. Today, 1,300 packages of rice will be shipped to Xiamen.

The day before yesterday, 2,900 packages of flour were shipped to Dalian, and today another 1,000 packages will be shipped to Xiamen and 3,500 packages to Shantou.

Also, yesterday, 370 packages of wheat came from Xinxiang.

Today, another 3,000 packages of bran and 120 packages of beans will be shipped to Xiamen, and 150 packages of beans to Shantou.

### Whole Lot Transactions of Hakka Xian Rice: Decision Awaited Today and Tomorrow

Yesterday, there was a slight arrival of Hakka Xian rice, but digestion was weak. After the street had smoothly handled Hakka and local Xian rice the previous days, their appetite had turned sluggish, and Hakka gangs and Japanese merchants had not yet initiated transactions. Therefore, only three to four hundred packages were traded in small quantities throughout the day. Although there were negotiations for whole lot transactions, a decision is still required today or tomorrow. The opening quotations were slightly higher than the previous market, but the situation quickly stabilized.

### Sugar Market: Re-exported Raw White Sugar Rises by 5 Fen

Yesterday, the sugar market trended towards stability. The guild set the price for spot 24 Dutch raw white sugar at 24.45 yuan per unit for goods in the warehouse, with no change. However, re-exported goods rose by 5 fen, with transactions at 16.25 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar spot goods in Puxi remained at 24 yuan, while goods in Pudong were quoted up by 1角. Domestic sugar was stable. More than a thousand packages of Chaoqing sugar continued to be offered, with Huanggangqing at 12 yuan, and the next grade at 11.80 to 11.75 yuan. Several hundred packages of Shangmian red sugar were sold at 14.80 to 14.67 yuan, and over a hundred packages of Hainan red sugar fetched a higher price of 11 yuan. Jianbang offered over two hundred packages of Diaoqing sugar at 11.1 yuan, which settled at 10.09 yuan. One hundred and ten packages of Xing red sugar were sold at 14.7 to 14.3 yuan, and dozens of packages of miscellaneous white sugar were sold for 18.1 yuan.

### Dried and Fresh Produce: Guangdong and Hong Kong Gangs Actively Purchase Hunan Lotus Seeds

Hunan lotus seeds are in tight supply because both the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs have been actively purchasing them in recent days. The market is very tight, and the previous quote of 120 yuan has been settled. Transactions on this street are also very active, so there are more merchants holding on to their goods. Yesterday, the market was re-quoted at 122 yuan, compared to the settled price of 180 yuan.

Today, there are 1,950 packages of raw peanuts.

Seafood: Winter Shark Fins Sell Well

Shark fins, according to usual practice, sell better at the end of the year. Recently, various grades have been sold, with prices ranging from 800 to 1,000 yuan per担 for Luzon King, 600 to 700 yuan for Tongbai, 700 to 900 yuan for Ding Sha, large and small Ersha are in short supply, 250 to 300 yuan for Sisha, 580 yuan for Duichi, 400 to 550 yuan for Mianqun, and Shangqing Pidai has also recently been out of stock, with Wugou at 170 to 280 yuan, Wupi at 100 to 200 yuan, and Wuyang at 40 to 100 yuan.

### Imports and Exports: Cargo Traffic Between Shanghai and Ningbo Is Quite Substantial

Since the opening of Ningbo, outgoing cargo from this city has been exceptionally congested. A large batch of sugar, piece goods, cotton yarn, and soybean oil has already been shipped. This morning, a German ship going to Ningbo carried more than 2,000 packages of sugar, more than 1,800 pieces of piece goods, and more than 700 pieces of cotton yarn. Incoming goods are also plentiful. Yesterday morning, a foreign merchant shipped more than 14,740 of cotton from Ningbo, a substantial amount. It is said that there is still a large batch waiting to be loaded in Ningbo. Also, the day before yesterday (the 3rd), a foreign merchant shipped more than 5,280 pieces of 儿子 from Wenzhou.

### Finance Section: Economic Data: Shanghai Financial Statistics Chart for 1938 (Summary of This Newspaper's Weekly Business Summary)

Entering 1938, Shanghai had unfortunately fallen. Fortunately, through the calming of public sentiment and the arduous efforts of all sectors, Shanghai's overall social economy was spared from disruption. The financial aspect was particularly stable. Since the resumption of newspaper publication, a weekly business summary has been published. To facilitate reference for all parties, we have specially compiled a summary of the past year and drawn a curve chart to allow readers to clearly understand the changes in general trends. We hope all sectors will pay attention.

Negotiable Instruments

After the establishment of the bank draft acceptance center, negotiable instruments clearly developed. Since the beginning of the war, the reduction in the circulation of negotiable instruments is definitely not due to a lack of creditworthiness. The main reason is the contraction of credit by the banking and financial sectors.

Interest Rates

Since the currency reform, the financial circles in Shanghai have gradually entered an era of low-interest rates. The authorities have also assisted in promoting the low-interest rate policy to promote the start of the national economic construction movement. However, since the August 13th Incident, banking and finance have been contracting credit, and the government authorities have been vigorously implementing currency contraction. Although the Shanghai interest rate market has not skyrocketed, it is enough to show a glimpse of the stability of the financial market.

Domestic Debt

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the stock exchange was ordered to suspend operations. Therefore, bonds after August 13th last year no longer had a legitimate market. The table below lists the shadow market prices. The emergence of the shadow market is said to have been caused by investors raising funds, which was then exploited by speculators. Now, the black market is used to maintain the bond market. Is this using poison to fight poison? Observing the rebound in the bond market in recent months, although stimulated by the bright prospects of the War of Resistance, the fact that someone is maintaining it cannot be denied.

(Note) All figures from August 1938 are Dawn Market prices, unit: National Currency Yuan. The total average index of each bond is based on the full price.

Gold Market

The fluctuation of gold prices in Shanghai is undoubtedly affected by the price of British gold. However, the rise in Shanghai gold is far more intense than that of British gold, which is undoubtedly stimulated by the outflow of funds. This trend became more obvious after April 1938. In autumn, British gold skyrocketed, and the rise in Shanghai gold became even more out of control.

(Note) Before August 1937, it was the price of Standard Gold. In September of the same year, it was the price of Standard Gold. From October to April 1938, it was the bank's purchase price of spot goods. After that, it was the closing price of the cash shadow market (Standard Gold per bar weighs ten Shanghai taels, equivalent to slightly more than eight and a half Treasury taels). The number of pence per ounce in London is the average price for the whole month.

Foreign Exchange

For half a year after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, China's foreign exchange remained stable. However, since the Japanese side created the "Federated Reserve Bank" and issued counterfeit banknotes in North China, China implemented controls to prevent foreign exchange from being lost, and gradually progressed to managing foreign trade. Those who lost their conscience took the opportunity to enter and exit the black market and were willing to be used by others, which is why the foreign exchange market plummeted. The table below shows the black market prices after March. The central bank's listing and its supply to those who are approved are still calculated according to the legal exchange rate and have never changed.

(Note) From March 1938, based on the average closing price of the foreign exchange black market, unit: One British pound equals National Currency Yuan; the rest are National Currency hundred yuan equals the number of US dollars, marks, francs, Hong Kong dollars, and Japanese yen. The solid line in the chart is the shadow market price after March of this year, and the dashed line is the central bank's listed price.

### A Discussion on Calligraphy in Primary and Secondary Schools

— Huang Ruozhou

The writing of every language has two forms, printing and handwriting. Our country's handwriting generally uses the regular script. However, the so-called regular script, although simpler than the original ancient script, seal script, and official script, is still not simple enough. Recently, whether it is the writing of literati, the notes of scholars, the accounting of merchants, or all kinds of applied documents of the masses, they generally use cursive script, simplifying various methods as handwriting, which can increase efficiency by three times. This shows that our country's handwriting style is no longer sufficient for regular script application.

Our country's writing has evolved from Guzhou to Small Seal Script, from Official Script to Cursive, Standard, and Running Script. The traces of its evolution are clearly visible. One type of cursive script, called Modern Cursive, mostly uses turning movements to replace the complicated strokes of regular script, and the brushstrokes are rounded and linked, which is quite suitable for writing. However, the current cursive script, running script, and simplified script have no standards, and both writers and readers feel inconvenienced because identification is difficult and many errors occur.

According to the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry, the intermediate grade of primary school should be familiar with the commonly used running and cursive simplified characters, and the senior grade should practice writing these characters. However, due to the lack of copying models and the lack of teaching methods, no one has complied with them, so that scholars need to copy and pick up things from east to west in the future, and develop today's neither donkey nor horse characters. If we follow the old ways and spread errors, we will not know where to end. This is the crisis of our country's writing. Recently, the Ministry of Education has seen that the local culture is gradually declining and has issued an order to primary and secondary schools across the country to focus on practicing calligraphy. Primary school graduates should be able to write regular script and commonly used semi-cursive script, and junior and senior high schools should focus on regular script and running cursive script, all mainly written with a brush. I believe that the regular script is common throughout the country and is always unanimous, and there is often no objection, but the running and cursive script has never had a style. All the running and cursive script calligraphy books of past dynasties have no fixed method, and often one character has several methods, and one method has several uses, making learning even more difficult. Therefore, it is suitable for appreciation, but it is not suitable for practical use. With this in mind, the reporter has selected a common book to supplement the deficiencies of regular script and use it as a handwriting style for standardization and facilitating circulation. The selected characters are the more common, recognizable, and easy-to-write characters in cursive, running, and simplified scripts. There is absolutely no reform of the characters, creating new styles from oneself. The author adheres to the principle of narrating but not creating, and there is no conflict with the inherent culture and the customary habits, so it is extremely convenient and easy to carry out. In this way, calligraphy in primary and secondary schools takes regular script as the foundation and running cursive script as the application, so that learning has a foundation, and the purpose of universal application is achieved, and the right track of learning calligraphy can be followed. Because there has been no method for teaching running cursive script, beginners feel it is difficult to get started. The reporter does not mind seeking details and has deeply researched and systematically reorganized cursive, running, and simplified calligraphy, so that scholars can understand the way. The compilation is generally based on regular script as the outline and is classified according to the Ci Yuan radicals. There are also characters that are easy to write but not easy to recognize, have a long history of circulation, and are widely used and indelible, such as "寿" (longevity), "者" (person), "尔" (you), etc. A separate character root is compiled, still based on the stroke number of the regular character as the determinant sequence. Under each radical and character root, the methods of forming the top, left, middle, right, and bottom are listed to achieve the effect of learning one thing and understanding three. However, this is a major matter, and I hope that the people of Hongda in the sea will further teach it, which would be fortunate.

### West Youth Basketball League: Ineffective Chase in the Second Half: Moore Loses to Hwa Lien; Chih Chih Also Loses to Mai Ling Hung; Tonight Paramount Plays Xu Fang

There were originally three matches in the West Youth Basketball League last night, but the first match between Zhen Dan and Mai Ling Jin was postponed for some reason, so only two matches were played. The match between Mai Ling Hung and Chih Chih took place first. Mai Ling Hung's momentum was strong, and Chih Chih was also well-organized, but ultimately, because Mai Ling's players were tall and strong, Chih Chih was 18 to 24 behind by six points in the first half. In the second half, Chih Chih tried hard to catch up, but because Mai Ling Hung's defense was tight, Chih Chih lost to Mai Ling Hung 38 to 47. In the final game, Hwa Lien played Moore. Hwa Lien's momentum was very high in the first half. After Sun Huipei opened the scoring, they were leading by a long way with 8 to 1 and 10 to 4. At the end of the first half, Hwa Lien was 15 and Moore was 7 points. After switching sides and fighting again, Moore's Ling Peng was very active. After 13 to 20, Xuan Hegao and Ling Peng scored three consecutive goals, chasing to 19 to 20, only one point behind. However, the good times did not last long. Hwa Lien's Shen Yugong and Sun Huipei's penalty shots were consecutive and accurate. Although Moore's Yu Tianqing pulled back a goal, it was still a drop in the bucket. When the whistle sounded, Hwa Lien defeated Moore 33 to 23.

### Hong Kong Holds Sino-Western Charity Track and Field Meet; South China Athletic Association Wins Both Men's and Women's Championships

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Sino-Western charity track and field meet, held to aid refugees, took place on the 24th and 25th of this month (that is, last Christmas) at the South China Athletic Association's stadium in Causeway Bay. Over 140 participants, representing various Chinese and Western organizations and individual athletes, competed in over 20 events. It was the grandest track and field meet on Hong Kong Island. Ticket sales totaled over HK$470. The South China Athletic Association swept both the men's and women's championships. The men's runner-up was Pui Ching Middle School, and the women's runner-up was Guangzhou University. While the track event results were not particularly outstanding, Tyler of the Hong Kong Police Force broke the Chinese national record in the discus throw, with a distance of 38.41 meters (the previous Chinese national record was 37.85 meters), adding considerable excitement to the event. In addition to track and field, there was also a gymnastic performance by the Overseas Chinese Middle School, which was well-received.

School Overview

### Zhengxing Girls' Middle School

The private Zhengxing Girls' Middle School, founded in the autumn of the twelfth year of the Republic, has now been in existence for five years. There have been several changes in personnel. In the twenty-third year, it was renamed Zhengxing Vocational Girls' Middle School. In July of the same year, the word "Vocational" was removed, and its registration was approved. The school was initially located on Seymour Road, near Jing'an Temple Road, and later moved to Avenue Lafayette, near Route Cardinal Mercier. In March of the twenty-fifth year, it moved to 162 Avenue Foch. The initial chairman of the board was Shen Junru, who was later succeeded by Chu [omitted character]. The principals have been Huang Daping from the twenty-second year to February of the twenty-fifth year, and Shen Junru from March of the twenty-fifth year to the twenty-seventh year. After August 13th, the renowned lawyer Shi Youfu took over. The student body has grown from over one hundred to over four hundred and thirty students, and the number of classes has expanded from six to eleven. After five years of effort, the school has now taken on a preliminary scale. The internal organization is currently divided into three departments: Secretariat, Instruction, and General Affairs. Each department has a director. Guo Xiuyan serves as both Secretary and Director of Instruction, Xu Jinan as Deputy Director of Instruction, and Shen Yue as Director of General Affairs. The curriculum for junior high school is undivided. For senior high school it is divided into General and Commercial. Teachers include Zhu Tianfan, Ze Sheng, Qian Boxian, and Zhu Shumei for Chinese Language; Wang Gong'an, Wang Dexun, Chen Liangyi, and Yang Zhongyun for Mathematics and Science; Lü Jingmei and Lu Zhuang for English; Huang Jueren and Chen Fengzhu for Social Sciences; Fan Beisan and Wang Shanzhang for Natural Sciences; and Gu Pinyu and Wang Rui for Commercial subjects. The internal facilities have been gradually added and improved over the years, and have not been affected by the war, so they can be described as substantial. Furthermore, in view of the heavy burden on parents during the national crisis, the tuition and miscellaneous fees charged are particularly low, and there are free tuition quotas for each grade, so there are also a disproportionately large number of students from impoverished families studying at the school. An affiliated elementary school is attached. It currently has over five hundred students. The middle and elementary schools together have over forty faculty and staff members, and over one thousand students.

### The Division Between Civilization and Barbarism

— Bai Ying

According to the boasting of a Japanese soldier, the level of knowledge of Japanese soldiers is far higher than that of Chinese soldiers. As a result, a "rear area" writer immediately wrote an article, asserting that China is a barbaric country with a low level of culture, and citing the words of a famous person, saying that great generals have never come from among barbarians, but from among cultured people.

Then, in order to show his "writer's" "impartial" attitude, he also said that we cannot deny the strength of wildness and prove the strengths of civilized people. Because in ancient history, there were many civilized countries that were conquered or threatened by barbarians. For example, ancient Persia, with a high level of civilization, was often invaded by barbarians. The Central Plains cultural area of China was often disturbed by Yi and Di tribes, and even conquered several times. Moreover, he concluded that the attempt of the proletariat to "conquer" the bourgeoisie is nothing more than the delusion of a victory of wildness with a lower cultural level.

However, the final victory in the battle between barbarism and civilization will inevitably still belong to civilization, even this "rear area" writer admitted. It is said that the struggle between ancient Sparta and Athens is the best example. Because although Sparta's military strength was strong for a time, Sparta ultimately perished, while the civilization of Athens still survives in the world today.

If today's Japan is the "civilized" Athens, and China is the "barbaric" Sparta, I don't know if this "writer" has the courage to admit it? Although he wanted to slap others in the face when he picked up his pen, he ended up slapping himself in the face every time!

Aggression is a barbaric act, even Hitler and Mussolini said so. Our "rear area" writer, as a supporter of the Berlin-Rome axis, naturally does not dare to innovate. In fact, a truth that has long been universally recognized cannot be denied no matter how cunning you are. However, the ambitions of aggressors will never stop their acts of aggression simply because such a truth exists. Therefore, one has no choice but to misattribute and switch the rifles around, insisting that the aggressor is the aggressed and that the aggressed is the aggressor. Although this strategy of reversing right and wrong is extremely weak, because it is "barbaric," they can no longer think of a "civilized" strategy.

To still be arguing today about who is the aggressor between China and Japan is simply an idiot talking nonsense. The League of Nations, gathering civilized countries from around the world, has already determined for us who the aggressor is, and world opinion has long unanimously exposed the true face of the aggressor. However, because "barbaric" weapons are still in the hands of the aggressor, although the theorem of right and wrong is clear, we still have to prove the truth of this theorem with our own blood and flesh.

From the perspective of common sense knowledge, perhaps the military technical knowledge of Japanese soldiers is stronger than that of Chinese soldiers. This is because Japan has this military technical equipment. If China also had this high level of technical equipment, then the knowledge of Chinese soldiers in this area would certainly not be inferior to that of Japan. As for the knowledge from the perspective of truth, the "cultural" nature of Japanese soldiers is most clearly demonstrated in the Nanjing Massacre and other atrocities. Taking another look at one of Amelets Veapa's Japanese spies (now published in "Translation Report"), one can better understand how much difference there is between the "cultural nature" in the mouths of Japanese soldiers and the "bestiality" of barbarians.

Great generals come from among cultured people, which is correct, as exemplified by China's supreme commander and his subordinates. As for Japan, the frequent changes of commanders in the sixteen months of the Sino-Japanese War (and now another major reshuffle) show their fluster, and the ugliness of the so-called "great generals" has been completely exposed. A schemer like Doihara is the epitome of a Japanese "great general"—cruel, tyrannical, ruthless, lacking in reason. All of this is the intellect of Japanese soldiers!

The division between civilization and barbarism of a nation is determined by the nation's sense of justice and its practice. This explanation also applies to the division between civilization and barbarism in the Sino-Japanese War. All distortions and cover-ups will not escape the demon-revealing mirror of truth.

### Flight

— Ji Han

This place is not a street, nor is it considered a lane, and it's even less of a road. It's just a mud path between two shacks, so let's call it a mud path.

The residents here don't use terms like "master," "madam," "miss," or "young master." But recently, someone new came, and everyone calls him "Mr." His surname is Bao. Counting from Little Sanzi, Little Liuzi, and so on, they call him Little Bao Mr.

Little Bao Mr. is only in his twenties, with a fair face, a high nose, and a receding hairline combed back. He wears a long gown and walks with a dignified air, but he is very kind to people.

Normally, for someone like Little Bao Mr. to appear in a shack would be quite a miracle. Now, everyone assumes he escaped from the war zone and is staying temporarily. Everyone knows he will eventually fly away like a bird.

But before he flies away, he always sits in front of the shack reading the "News" newspaper, especially on good weather mornings.

"Ah, Little Bao Mr. knows how to read?"

"Tch, how could he read the newspaper if he didn't know how to read!"

The person who was scolded walked away with a red face.

Little Bao Mr. laughed when he heard it, his eyes shifting to the one who said "Tch" to the other, nodding at him:

"Good morning!"

"Oh, oh, Little Bao Mr., good morning to you!"

"What's your name?"

"My name is Ronggui." He wrung his hands as if he didn't know where to put them. "My mom calls me Little Guier."

"Haha, great, great!"

This laugh made Little Guier happy, and he moved closer, also peering at the newspaper. Little Bao Mr. knew he was looking at the black man in the Darkie toothpaste advertisement. Looking at Little Guier, apart from his yellow teeth, his face did resemble him.

"Guier brother, how old are you this year?"

"Nineteen!"

"Have you studied?"

He shook his head.

Little Bao Mr. knew this question was unnecessary.

"Have you always lived here?"

"No, last year I lived in Zhabei."

"How many people are in your family?"

"Dad, Mom, me, three. I used to have an older sister, but later..." His eyes reddened, and he couldn't continue.

"Later! What happened?"

"Later in Zhabei she was ××..." He hesitated, "was ×× killed!" He explained, with an angry look on his face.

Little Bao Mr. understood and didn't pursue it, changing the subject and talking to him about unimportant things and the news in the newspaper. He waited until his mother called him before he left.

From that day on, Little Guier and Little Bao Mr. became friends, always chatting when they had nothing to do. Other young men, not much different from Little Guier, all flocked around, and Little Bao Mr. talked and asked questions as usual.

In the morning and evening, there would be crowds of people on this mud path, listening to Little Bao Mr.'s talk: the news in the newspaper, and his own opinions. Whenever there were news related to ××, he always talked about it vividly. Undoubtedly, the hearts of these resilient young men were gradually warming up and becoming inflamed.

Finally, on a dark night, when Little Bao Mr. believed the time was ripe, he quietly led more than a dozen enthusiastic young soldiers, leaving this narrow mud path, and flying to their vast journey, to do that great work.

### Regarding "A Record of the Massacre in Jiading" – A Reportage on the People's Resistance Against the Qing Dynasty in the Late Ming Dynasty

— Yang Kuanzheng

The book "A Record of the Massacre in Jiading," originally named "Dongtang Diary," also known as "Jia Ding Yi You Ji Lue," is a book that records and describes how the people of Jiading resisted during the late Ming Dynasty! The author, Mr. Zhu Zisu, personally experienced it, and what he recorded is of course a very personal fact. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Wu Sangui led the Qing troops south, and Han traitors surrendered one after another. After Yangzhou was broken, the people who were still defending and resisting were Jiayin, Kunshan, Jiading, Songjiang, and Jinshanwei. The resistance in Yangzhou, Jiading and Jiangyin was the most enthusiastic and tragic, and the massacres were the most severe. There was even such a popular saying at the time as "Suffering is worse than Jiading, and tragedy is worse than Jiangyin!" The tragic situation at that time can be imagined!

"Dongtang Diary" is a real record of the time, and is a first-class reportage of national consciousness. The author, Mr. Zhu Zisu, named Jiu Chu, was a student of the Yi Xiang. He abandoned the post of the Ministry of Rites in Jiashen, and retired to teach. He was of course a man of integrity. He also compiled Records of the Remaining People of the Past Dynasties, and Sad and Loyal Records of Wu Lue, etc., which are all rich in national consciousness. Mr. Zhu's work depicting the resistance of the people of Jiading is of course also rich in national consciousness. As far as I know, there are currently six publications of this book:

Jingtuo Yishi Edition

Mingji Baishi Edition

Record Compilation Edition

Shenbao Hall Lithographic Edition

China's Internal Disorder and External Calamity Series Edition

Jiaqing Jiazi Huitang Zhu Chunsheng Manuscript Copy

The Zhu Chunsheng manuscript copy is signed with the original name "Dongtang Diary," with a brief introduction by Zhu Jiuchu in the front and a postscript by Zhu Chunsheng on the 23rd night of the first month of Jiazi at the back. It is now in the collection of Zhou Chengzhong of Jiading, and was once printed and distributed. The original was displayed at the Shanghai Literature Exhibition held at the former Shanghai Museum. Comparing this version with the previous publications, it is known that the previous publications have been altered by people of the Qing Dynasty, and have lost their original appearance! But this manuscript copy is Mr. Zhu Zisu's original manuscript.

This manuscript copy calls the people's "righteous army" "our army," and the "Qing soldiers" "northern soldiers." All the newly appointed dignitaries of the Qing court are also referred to as "northern" without the prefix "Qing." However, many publications call them "Great Qing" "Qing soldiers," and also call "Prince Yu" "Grand Marshal of the Qing Troops," which is of course not the work of Mr. Zhu Zisu, who had a national consciousness. This manuscript copy criticizes the then magistrate of Jiading, saying that Magistrate Qian Mo "was not interested in his official position, and the people had no laws and disciplines," but the publications have deleted this! As evidence, "Tizhai Jianwen Lu" by Su Rong of Jiading also says:

"The new magistrate of Jiading is Qian Mo from Jiashan, Zhejiang, who was selected from the south. His name is Mo, and he was a Jinshi in the same list as the former magistrate Cao. In the court, he became a family disciple. He was known for his youth and his reputation, and when he was in politics, he was dedicated to abolishing [illegible], and the people were mostly resentful!"

At that time, the magistrate Qian Mo was indeed a playboy who exploited the people, but the publications deleted his crimes and hid his sins!

This manuscript copy says that there was a man named Jiang Ruolai at that time, who was truly a loyal and virtuous man, saying, "When the northern soldiers entered Nandou, Ruolai escaped and returned, killed his wife and children, and went to the sea to rely on King Yiyang." How virtuous it was for him to kill his wife and children and escape into the sea! However, the publications call Ruolai "a rascal in the market, who met by chance with [illegible] strength, and was promoted to Dudou. When he heard that Weiyang had fallen, he abandoned his post and fled back," turning Ruolai into a derelict rascal! This manuscript copy says that Ruolai "looked at the dozens of copper cannons in the warehouse, and had people carry them with him as he left, and then entered the sea through the Xu family line." He carried away the heavy weapons stored in Jiading to avoid aiding the enemy. This was the most necessary thing to do during the retreat! But the publications changed it again, saying that Ruolai "[illegible], leaving only tens of thousands of copper coins, [illegible] as he left, he plundered the Xu family line, leaving nothing behind, and the cries of the poor people shook the sky." Jiang Ruolai became a bandit! The Qing people's ability to change [illegible] is really clever, changing "dozens of copper cannons" into tens of thousands of copper coins, and changing "then entered the sea through the Xu family line" into "plundered the Xu family line." It was not enough to say it so badly, so they added the sentences "leaving nothing behind, and the cries of the poor people shook the sky!"

Also, when the righteous soldiers of Waigang Loutang fought a great battle with Liang Desheng, and the righteous soldiers won a great victory, this manuscript copy described it in great detail and vividly—

"At that time, our army was on the verge of collapse, but the Waigang Loutang soldiers engaged in fierce fighting. Niansandu has always been known as a den of thieves, and its people are quick and courageous. They killed the most, and after a few hours, the village soldiers gathered together, competing to burn (Liang) Desheng's ship. (Li) Chengdong took the fine gold and beautiful pearls, famous swords and precious knives that he had obtained from Weiyang, Jinling, Biling, and Jingkou, and put them all to the torch. Those that had not been destroyed were all plundered by the village soldiers. The ship was full of women, who were burned very miserably. Among them, there was a very beautiful woman who called out: "I am the daughter of a Hanlin official, and my home is in Yangzhou. I was taken here by force. Please save me!" The village soldiers all said, "You can jump into the water!" The woman cried and said, "My feet are chained and I can't escape!" Before she could finish speaking, the raging fire burned her body! The smoke and flames covered the sky, and the red light shone for more than ten miles. It did not extinguish until dawn. Desheng fled east in the night, barely managing to arrive."

How brave and resourceful was the ambush and fire attack of the righteous soldiers at this time! The customs of the people in the Waigang area are still very strong today. The bandits in peacetime will stand up and become heroes of righteousness when the great era comes. This is the same in ancient and modern times! The publications that had been altered by the Qing people only had a few words, saying: "At dawn, several of Desheng's soldiers' heads were counted, totaling eighty-four. The rest of Desheng's troops fled east, barely managing to arrive."

In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the Qing people wantonly altered this type of work that displayed the national consciousness, playing around with black and white. This "Record of the Massacre in Jiading" is another example.

(Note) The "Jiading County Yiyou Chronicles" in "Painful History" published by the Commercial Press in the first and second years of the Republic of China was based on Zhu Chunsheng's manuscript copy. "Painful History" is now out of print. I and my friends have been searching for two or three years. Two months ago, Zhao Jingshen found it in Laiqingge. It is now included in the "Biography of Jiading Righteous People" published by the World Book Bureau to spread it widely. Editor

### A Traveler on a Journey

— Ai Ding

The last glow of the setting sun,

Sinks on the treetops of the forest.

The traveler eagerly hopes:

That the sunlight does not fall.

He still has to travel a stretch of the road.

The horizon drowns out the setting sun,

And the golden light of the gossamer is also withdrawn.

He still moves forward,

Wanting to drag back the sunlight's illumination,

To let him travel another section.

Groping forward in the twilight,

Thorns break his feet.

Reeds sting his hand,

Go, go,

Not afraid of difficulty, only of doing.

Across the river flickers a bright lamp,

Surrounded by a warm countryside.

He wants to get over there,

Although in front of him is a river,

And behind him is a mountain!

### New Year and New Clothes

— Zhang Zhenshan

The progression of time is like a running train, quickly carrying the New Year once again. Welcoming the New Year with joy and happiness, and watching everything prepare for a fresh start, the surging inner self has an indescribable feeling of pleasure, excitement, good fortune, and pride! Those who have been striving and toiling all year round will use entertainment to wash away the year's fatigue and exhaustion, and at the same time, they will inevitably make new expressions in their private lives.

No matter what class of people they are, the most obvious activity in the New Year is changing into new clothes. Even if they are poor scholars, or shabby young men, they must change into a relatively clean outfit. Speaking in a boastful tone on the surface seems somewhat vulgar, but in fact, wearing new clothes in the New Year not only serves as a festive embellishment, but also implies many profound meanings: it represents a fresh start and the renewal of all things, it symbolizes increasing joy and happiness, it has the power to encourage people to make new efforts and progress, and it has the advantage of regulating a depressed spirit.

Therefore, wearing new clothes in the New Year is not unique to Shanghai, not unique to China, and in fact, every nation in the world has this custom and habit. It seems to be an innate sense and action. At this time, even those who don't like to dress up will naturally dress up. The wealthiest millionaires, wives, misses, and young masters wear brand-new, noble clothes. The less wealthy will wear slightly lower-quality new clothes, and the even less wealthy will wear cheaper new clothes. Although the division of materials is based on economic environment, the meaning is the same.

### Tofu and Tofu Milk

— Shuangxi Yiye

"Speaking of winter, I suddenly thought of tofu. It's a 'small saucepan' (aluminum pot) of boiled tofu, steaming hot. The water is boiling, like many fish eyes. Small pieces of tofu are kept inside, tender and slippery, as if wearing a white fox fur coat inside out. --- Father said it was cold at night, and eating it would warm everyone up. We all liked this plain boiled tofu..."

The above passage is what the literary researcher Mr. Zhu Ziqing tells us in his essay titled "Winter."

Tofu! Tofu! People all over the world like to eat tofu, but they don't know why tofu is tofu.

According to a food nutrition researcher, the soybeans used to make tofu contain the most protein, and also contain many other nutrients needed by the human body. It can be seen that all the conditions for a food to be complete can be obtained from tofu. If we use more modern terms, then vitamins A, B, C... all the way to X or N (although some have not yet been discovered) are all contained in it. It is truly a "background player" among tonics! Other tonics only have vitamin C but not A, or only have A but lack B; there are many omissions, which are not comparable to tofu. Why must Zhu Ziqing write about tofu when he eats tofu? It's because he has to write it; there is probably a good reason.

Tofu's "friend for life" is tofu milk. In terms of experience, tofu is of course more experienced, but in terms of quality, tofu milk must be considered first.

Tofu can be old or tender, while tofu milk is a flowing body that is so tender that it cannot be any tenderer. It can be said that it is a small family jade who has not yet left the "pot" [?]. Its pleasantness and its ability to benefit people's vitality cannot be described in a few words.

As for its low price, the convenience of using it, and the ease of digestion, these are especially the case. It is truly the supreme tonic for the public in winter.

### The Story of Gift-Giving

— Books

Speaking of gift-giving, it's truly a difficult problem! Often, someone spends a great deal of money, thinking they've found an extremely satisfactory and precious item, but the result is that the recipient doesn't even glance at it with proper eyes, isn't that strange? Let me give you an example: In the past, Mr. Kraner, a British man who was the Chief Traffic Superintendent of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, loved to smoke cigars. What wasn't needed along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway? What wasn't contracted out to merchants? When the New Year season arrived, which merchant wouldn't plan for their business in the coming year by flattering him—presenting a generous winter solstice gift? My friend, Mr. Sun, contracted for yellow sand and gravel. At first, every year he bought very expensive cigars to give to Mr. Kraner, who would always laugh and accept them, perhaps saying "Thank you." Once, when the gift was delivered a little late, Mr. Kraner happened not to be home. A servant was in the process of opening boxes of cigars. From the cigar boxes discarded to the side, Mr. Sun knew at a glance that they were all very precious imports, and his own brand was among them. "Why are they being thrown into baskets?" he wondered, and asked the servant. It turned out they were all winter solstice gifts from other people. Because Mr. Kraner didn't like smoking them himself, he soaked them in a water tank, preparing to use them as fertilizer for the flowers and trees. He was even more puzzled and had to ask the servant again. Only then did he learn that the cigars Mr. Kraner smoked were managed by only one foreign firm in Shanghai, and only a very small number of famous people smoked them. If you didn't specify that you were buying them as a gift for one of these smokers, you couldn't possibly buy them. Mr. Sun received this unexpected news, quickly took the gift he had brought with great enthusiasm and left. He went personally to the Renji Foreign Firm, explained his intention, and indeed, he achieved his goal this time. He rushed to Mr. Kraner's house that very night to give them to him. When Mr. Kraner saw that he was being given exactly what he loved, he immediately smiled brightly, extended his hand, and shook it tightly, repeatedly saying, "Thank you! Thank you for your kindness!" Mr. Sun's joy was truly extraordinary. From then on, everything went smoothly. Until Mr. Kraner left his post, his contract for yellow sand and gravel never suffered any unexpected problems, all thanks to this small box of cigars!

The thread in the young lady's hand, the clothes on the healthy son.

Corrigendum: In the article "Face Painting in Peking Opera," published on January 2nd, there was a slight error in the text. In the fourteenth line, the word "後 (hou, back)" in "...片子往後貼一些 (the hairpieces should be pasted a bit back)..." should be "前 (qian, front)." Also, the following was omitted: "...反之，瘦的臉就可以把這些兩鬢的片子貼後一些 (conversely, for thin faces, these hairpieces on the temples can be pasted further back)...." We hereby correct this.

### A Weekly Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

I'm very ashamed! In this season of renewal, I have no good dishes to offer to my dear readers. Chicken is what I desire; duck is also what I desire; but after flipping through my menu, I can't seem to find them as if they were treasures. Again and again, it's all for the sake of economy. I've been reading this newspaper these past few days and have seen the advertisements for the Quansheng electric cooker in restaurants, which can't help but make my appetite stir. However, including it in home-style cooking is not economically feasible; moreover, probably not many homes have an electric cooker. Now, to satisfy our cravings, let's make a Ten-Ingredient Small Hot Pot. Take beef slices, shredded onions, chicken or duck gizzards, vermicelli, tofu, and tatsoi or spinach, etc., add soy sauce and lard, braise until thoroughly cooked, then put them in a small tin pot and place it on a small stove to heat and eat. It's even more flavorful than eating Quansheng, and even the Japanese-style "Sukiyaki" can't compare. If you, dear readers, have a poor appetite, why not give it a try?

### Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation in Chengdu

— Xu Eryin

In Guangdong and Guangxi, all we see is short clothing, it's rare for anyone to wear long robes; but in Chengdu, all we see are long robes, it's rare to wear short clothing, the exact opposite. Chengdu also has a fashion for mandarin jackets, and not only older and middle-aged people wear them, but young people can't do without them either. One of my classmates used to wear suits and hats in Shanghai, but after returning to Chengdu for four years, he wears silk robes, black mandarin jackets, and a melon-shaped skullcap. Civil servants naturally wear Zhongshan suits, but because most civil servants are somewhat hunchbacked, and can never puff out their chests, they still can't look energetic wearing Zhongshan suits. Students naturally all wear gray ramie student uniforms, but students in Sichuan often go to teahouses, open the buttons on their necks, put their belts on the tea table, and recline in bamboo chairs as if they're sitting but not sitting, sleeping but not sleeping. In this way, they are even less presentable than the remnants of the long-robe and mandarin-jacket era.

Women's clothing, however, is the same as everywhere else, you can see everything from ancient times to Westernized styles.

On the street, what especially attracts the attention of newcomers are the lamas, in their dark red robes. The clothing of ordinary Hui people is exactly the same as ours, as are their food, housing, and transportation.

Food Speaking of the food of Chengdu, it's truly inexhaustible. Sichuan cuisine is famous, needless to say; but what's even more unforgettable are the many snacks that can only be tasted in Chengdu.

On my first night in Chengdu, I was invited by my classmates to a snack shop with "Wu Chaoshou" written on the sign. I thought to myself, it's probably named after an outstanding chef named Wu. I heard my classmates call out "Two orders of chaoshou," and only then did I realize that chaoshou is a type of food. I asked my classmates, and they told me that chaoshou is wonton, the same as wonton in Cantonese restaurants. Besides Wu Chaoshou, there's also Dwarf Chaoshou Ye Degui, both are clean, but their small storefronts are always packed. Naturally, their reputations are well-deserved, a small bowl is enough to make you ask for more. The taste is indescribable. In short, all the snacks in Chengdu have several common advantages: one is that they're cheap, two is that they're delicious, and three is that they don't fill you up.

The dumplings in Lychee Lane unfortunately must have a large amount of "red oil" added, if you can't eat spicy food, the deliciousness will be driven away by the spiciness.

An order of steamed dumplings has ten, only equivalent to one or two elsewhere, not too many to put all in your mouth. The glutinous rice balls and 24 Spring are the best of their kind.

In short, Chengdu is an antique and decadent city, Chengdu has "decadent snacks" that don't harm the spleen and stomach, as Mr. Zhou Zuoren said. It's a pity that Mr. Zhou didn't realize there's such a good place outside of Beijing.

Housing Naturally, Chengdu also has slums, which are outside the city and far away.

Inside the city, it's completely different. Westernized are the shops on Chunxi Road commercial field, those with ancient styles are the mansions in the residential area of Shao City.

Whether large, medium, or small, mansions always have, first, a very presentable gatehouse, second, a red lantern hanging at the entrance, and third, a white-haired gatekeeper sitting between the outer and inner gates. This gatekeeper may be half-paralyzed, or may be blind in both eyes, and nine out of ten love to doze off, so people entering and exiting are not blocked every time. It is said that this is merely to "make the mansion look like a mansion."

Entering the inner gate, you can see one or two withered trees, three or four slender bamboos, five or six pots of chrysanthemums, then, a spacious living room, a lifeless courtyard.

The way people live in Chengdu is probably the same as their transportation, maintaining a full official style.

Transportation People in Chengdu rarely go out. Chengdu is nine and three-tenths of a mile square, they say they live their whole lives within these nine and three-tenths of a mile. Going out beyond Niushi Kou is a big deal, going to Shanghai is called studying abroad, and they can receive overseas study expenses in the provincial government. After returning from studying abroad, they all compete for jobs, whatever they learned outside is not questioned.

But people in Chengdu still don't like to move. They can't bear to leave the comfortable, leisurely Chengdu.

People in Chengdu walk on the street, mostly without anything to do, maybe they just came out of a teahouse, maybe they're going to some "De Yi Lou," "Gu He Yuan," "Bu Ru Gui" to sip tea. They always walk very slowly, so even rickshaws can only go slowly, because the sidewalk and the road are not separate, except when important people are passing through, and the middle of the road also has leisurely strollers.

There are few cars in Chengdu, and many rickshaws, which are cheap, almost the most in the country. There are horses, mules, public vehicles, sedan chairs, bamboo carriers, wooden boats, and wood-fueled road vehicles. The roads of Shu are not difficult, the difficulty lies in the lack of modern means of transportation, but it's still passable.

Arts and Entertainment

### A Brief Discussion of Acrobatics

— Limei

"Jianghu" skills, there are many kinds, using either tools or animals, generally called acrobatics, also called mixed plays. Examining its origins, it has been around for a long time. The History of the Later Han Dynasty mentions stopping fish-dragon acrobatics; the History of the Tang Dynasty states that in September of the second year of the Baoli era, acrobatics were viewed at the Xuanhe Hall for three days and then stopped. So the name "acrobatics" existed in the Han Dynasty. The idea is that selling skills and presenting art became complete by the Han Dynasty, so even the emperor often enjoyed watching them. However, as the pear garden became more prosperous in later generations, this type of acrobatics gradually declined, and those who practiced it were mostly common and rude people, not worthy of elegance, so they were not valued by the world.

For those performing acrobatics with tools, in ancient times there were lifting tripods, walking on beams, swallowing knives, and treading on fire, etc.; what is popular today are large sets of magic tricks such as juggling bowls, hanging upside down, walking on ropes, swallowing swords, and eating iron balls, which often attract audiences. Juggling bowls, hanging upside down, and walking on ropes are mostly performed by women. Swallowing swords, eating iron balls, and catching knives with the gate are mostly performed by men. What the world calls "two and a half sets of magic" refers to the skills performed by these men. Generally, women's performances are characterized by agility, while men's performances are characterized by the control of vital energy.

As for performances using animals, they can be divided into monkey shows and horse shows. Monkey shows originated earliest, the Book of Rites and Music Records mentions that "disturbing the children" refers to monkeys, and that dancing refers to monkey shows. It turns out that playing monkeys for entertainment existed as early as the Spring and Autumn period. Monkey handlers teach monkeys to perform actions, guiding them with gongs and drums, making them wear hats, clothes, ride sheep, push carts, carry sedan chairs, etc., to entertain people. Horse shows also have ancient origins, the Discourses on Salt and Iron mentions horse shows fighting tigers; the Biography of Empress Zhen in the Records of the Three Kingdoms states that when the Empress was eight years old, there were people performing horse shows outside, and the family all went to the attic to watch, but the Empress alone did not go; it can be seen that the evolution of horse shows has a long history. Horse shows are more complex and elaborate than monkey shows, some dismount, grab the saddle with their hands and go up, which is called tingma (listening horse). Others hold the stirrups firmly and swing back and forth from behind, which is called tiaoma (jumping horse). Others leave the saddle, extend their right foot, hang on the horse's tail, put their left foot in the stirrup and hold the tail with their right hand, which is called xian'an (presenting the saddle). Others throw their feet to the ground, drag the horse backwards, pick up objects from the ground, and then jump back on the horse, which is called tuoma (dragging horse). These kinds of skills are very similar to the performances of Western circus troupes.

Performers of acrobatics sell their skills everywhere, often supplementing with monkey shows and horse shows to form a troupe, using them to decorate. These people mostly belong to the salt registration, and every year on the sixteenth day of the first month, they must gather at the ancient Ji Temple in the west of Yancheng County (sixty li from the city) for three days. Performers come to gather from as far north as Dalu and as far south as western Zhejiang, and the number of boats gathered is countless, at least several hundred. When the period is over, they scatter and return, so many families near the ancient Ji Temple also use acrobatics as a side business. The ancient Ji Temple is just a small village, with only over a hundred families in the surrounding area. When the children of acrobatic families are five or six years old, they are taught various skills, such as following flying feet and doing somersaults, etc., and when they grow up, they are taught other skills according to their gender. There are also those who raise adopted children and teach them skills, and when they grow up, they rely on them for a living.

Performers of acrobatics are not valued by the world, unlike the world-renowned Western circus troupes. I have tried to discuss this, and I deeply believe that there are several reasons for the decline of acrobatics in our country: first, weak capital, these people often use old and broken equipment, have narrow ambitions, and do not plan to improve. Second, outdated technology, mostly following their teachers, going out to perform, never thinking about research and improvement, and even less about using scientific technology. Third, the viewing methods need to be improved, after the audience pays to enter, the person in charge repeatedly asks for money, giving people a bad impression. Objectively speaking, this kind of acrobatics is most suitable for the entertainment tastes of our country's rural people; it is easy to hold a performance in a ten-acre field, sounding gongs, unlike city theaters which require a certain amount of construction costs. I hope that those who care about the entertainment of the masses will rise up and seek ways to improve it.

### A Groundbreaking Theatre Person: An Interview with Ms. Gu Han

— Tieli

"Has Miss Gu Han always been in Shanghai?" I asked.

"Shanghai and I have known each other for quite some time, but this time, I haven't been in Shanghai for long." Her Mandarin was very crisp.

"Where has the lady been in the past?"

"In the past, I could really be considered a traveler of life." She smiled slightly, and didn't continue. Seeing that I was hoping to hear more, she continued, "Nanjing, Beijing, Fujian, Chengdu, Lianyungang, and places in Jiangnan and Jiangbei. Recently, it's not as convenient as before, and I've become one of those confined to a lone island."

"Since the lady has seen so much and has such rich life experience, participating in theatre and performing life is most suitable for the needs of the theatre movement. May I ask, what did the lady study in the past? Has she ever performed plays anywhere?"

"I'm very ashamed, although I've traveled to many places, I have no special skills. I love music the most, and I studied it in a specialized school. After I graduated from teacher's college, I performed operas on a large scale in Lianyungang. I've also tried several plays."

She is a girl with a very Eastern charm, her speech and manner are obviously generous and without a trace of affectation; she smiled again and said: "Life should be more serious, the so-called "modern" seems to lack the purpose of a good and beautiful life."

"I heard that Director Wu Cun believes that the lady is the most expressive out of hundreds and thousands of people. Why doesn't the lady want to be on the silver screen?"

"You're too kind! Where would I have such talent? There are many better ones! The bitter and spicy tastes of life have given me many deep impressions!" The lady was somewhat touched.

"What are the lady's thoughts on performing in the play 'Night of Joy'?"

"What thoughts could I have! You're overestimating me! But a person must always recognize their own position." This is a very philosophical answer. Miss Gu seems like a quiet daffodil, a lotus flower standing tall.

"What kind of roles does a lady like to play?" I asked. "I think I have to try them all, but I hate those who are absurd and unconscious."

"What kind of role is the lady playing now?" I asked again.

"Not so much. Those with more action are more difficult to play, and they are often not easy to please, that is to say, they are generally easily overlooked by the audience, but those who know the truth are not included." She said very solemnly.

"The lady is tired! The lady's efforts with a serious stance are a rare gain in the art world."

In the sound of "goodbye," I was left with an impression that was both rich in experience and lively and generous.

### Talking About Radio Plays (Continued)

— Chen Dabei

It is true that the audience of radio plays willingly relegated themselves to the position of the blind, just as the audience of silent films in the past willingly relegated themselves to the position of the deaf. But many Shanghai friends who love to listen to a certain kind of local opera have told me that when they first heard that kind of opera on the radio, because they were familiar with the dialect, they found it indescribably beautiful; but when they saw the same group of actors performing on a stage at a grand gathering, they realized that they were a group of vulgar and unsightly "hooligans," and so they were not very willing to listen to their broadcasts anymore.

Yes, the beauty of the imagination that we evoke from hearing is a million times more beautiful than the beauty of the phenomena that we arouse from sight. Six years ago, I organized a radio drama group called the "Shanghai Guanyin Drama Society." In that society, there was a Tianjin lady whose voice was very round and beautiful, and whose tone was very rich in emotion and power. Her power was able to draw tears from her companions, causing everyone to sob and cry without end. She was also so smart that she could read new scripts that she had never seen before, and express every sentence and every word fully, expressing the emotions that the playwright hoped she would express, causing countless listeners to involuntarily write letters to praise her performance art. There were even many lustful youths who sent love letters, asking to meet her once. After she finished reading those boring letters, she always threw them into the stove or the letter basket, and never wrote back. But one night, after she finished broadcasting at the radio station, she suddenly burst into tears. After I repeatedly asked her, she showed me a signed love letter, which stipulated that she would meet at ten o'clock the next morning in the French Park, and if she disappointed him, he would immediately jump into the Huangpu River. She lost her mind and asked me to help her solve the problem of "saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda." This time, I persuaded her to go. After she went and came back, she cried even more. It turned out that the beautiful part of her was entirely in her intelligence and voice, but her posture and appearance were enough to make the youth who sent the love letter not say a word to her, bow deeply to her, and walk away. It is likely that he would no longer be willing to jump into the Huangpu River. (End)

The special feature of radio plays lies in this point, it can bring out the highest standard of beauty in your ideal - the beauty of Cui Yingying and Lin Daiyu... the beauty that no star or king can play

More on the production, performance, dubbing and other issues related to radio plays will be discussed later.

### "Working Women's Drama Troupe" to Perform "Women's Apartment"

The Shanghai Chinese Professional Women's Club is organized by professional women in Shanghai. Since its opening, it has achieved remarkable results, and various entertainment departments have become more active. The drama group has recently developed into the "Working Women's Drama Troupe," and recently participated in the three-day joint performance of four groups raising funds for destitute refugees, receiving rave reviews and high praise. The troupe is now scheduled to perform the four-act play "Women's Apartment" on the fifteenth of this month (Sunday) at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, day and night. The director, Wu Mei, has a long history in the theatre movement, and everyone who pays attention to the production movement knows her. This time, she is using her experience to take on the role of director, and she is sure to be happy and competent, needless to say.

### New Year's Jokes

In the feudal bureaucracy of the past, people loved to hear auspicious words, especially on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. A servant named Gao Sheng worked at a certain mansion. This man was extremely mischievous, often making the master so angry that he wanted to die; but according to the rules of the bureaucracy, he could not fire anyone until the end of the year. Seeing that New Year's Eve was approaching, the master decided not to use him next year. Who knew that on the big day of New Year's Eve, everyone, high and low, was busy, and by the time they had finished worshiping the gods, they had already kowtowed to welcome the New Year. The master suddenly remembered that he wanted to fire Gao Sheng. Gao Sheng was a clever ghost, and as soon as he saw that the situation was not right, he ran to the master before the master could open his mouth, gave him a salute, and asked, "Master, will you still get promoted next year?" The master thought, this kid is really hateful, just after saying goodbye to the old year, on the side of the New Year, how can he say that the master will not be promoted next year, and quickly replied with a smile: "The master wants to get promoted, wants to get promoted." Gao Sheng turned his face away and said to his companions: "I, Gao Sheng, will work for another year." (Mu Yun)

### Secret History of the Imperial Court and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (6) (5)

— Xu Muyun

Once, someone said that a hobbyist sang opera and didn't understand "qi kou" (that is, taking a breath when singing), and often after three or two sentences, he would be exhausted and hoarse, and was booed off the stage. One day, he suddenly visited a brilliant teacher, and asked, "Is there any secret to taking a breath when singing?" His teacher replied, "Of course there is, but you have to remember clearly where to take a small breath and when to take a big breath, and that's it." He asked with difficulty, "I'll have to ask the teacher to teach me this." His teacher then recited the erhu interlude and asked him to sing Hong Yang Dong. "For the country..." Four sentences in Erhuang. As soon as he finished singing the three words "for the country," his teacher stared at him with two big eyes, as if shouting a command, and said, "Small breath!" Then he sang "that he can," and as soon as he finished singing the word "he," the teacher shouted again, "Half breath!" Then he sang "half a day of leisure," and the teacher shouted again, "Big breath!" He seemed to feel much less effort. Because his memory was not good, he was afraid of mixing up the places for the three kinds of breaths, so when the teacher shouted the command, he also recited it. Who knew that this had become his habit, and when he went on stage to sing opera again, as soon as he came on stage and sang "for the country," he also shouted, "Small breath!" After that, he kept shouting "half breath" and "big breath." At this time, the erhu player, the drummer, and those who watched the show were all confused and said that his singing method was neither in the style of the Zhang school nor the Tan school, and that it was probably the Yang school (insiders often call outsiders yangmao).

Also, one time, an old actor was singing "Dingjun Mountain," but the one playing Yan Yan had a lisp, and when Zhang He asked him to report his name, he pronounced Yan Yan as "Grandpa." When Huang Zhong heard this, he couldn't hold it in anymore, and he laughed so hard that he couldn't straighten up. Yan Yan quickly ran forward and pulled him, saying, "Get up and take an arrow!" Huang Zhong continued to lie on the stage laughing, saying, "Good grandson, grandpa really can't get up."
