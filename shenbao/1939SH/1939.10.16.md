### Soviet Union Continues to Pursue Active Policies in the Far East; Soviet-German Rapprochement Weakens Japan's Position; Negotiations on Japanese-Soviet Issues Have Not Yet Begun

Paris: Political figures here recently stated that the Soviet Union has not abandoned its active policies towards the Far East. After concluding a non-aggression treaty with Germany at the end of August, it unexpectedly signed a ceasefire agreement with Japan on the Nomonhan border. This action was in stark contrast to the protracted negotiations in the past (the Japanese-Soviet fisheries negotiations being one example), which surprised the general public. At the time, the German side explained that this was a victory for its foreign policy because the Soviet Union, being adjacent to Japan, could unite with Germany to fully address various issues in the West. There were even rumors that Japan and the Soviet Union would hold further wide-ranging negotiations to resolve various outstanding issues. However, in reality, these negotiations have not yet begun, and the Soviet government has closed its consulates in various occupied areas of China, apparently intending to provide substantial assistance to the Chinese Nationalist government. The recent victories of the Chinese army in northern Hunan are, to some extent, due to the Soviet Union's increased assistance. In this way, the Soviet Union, after approaching Germany, has not only destroyed the Anti-Comintern Pact but has also weakened Japan's position, enabling it to seize extremely great benefits. Even in terms of assisting China, it contradicts the complete cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union that Berlin has been promoting. (Havas dispatch from the 15th)

Tokyo: Last night, political figures here received reports that Ambassador Tōgō Shigenori and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov are conducting negotiations on a Soviet-Japanese trade agreement.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that he had no knowledge of the imminent conclusion of negotiations on a Soviet-Japanese trade agreement. (Haitong dispatch from the 15th)

Editorial

### Reforming the Moral Reformation

In July of this year, a World Assembly for Moral Rearmament was held in California, USA. The Moral Rearmament movement began in June of last year and was initiated by Dr. Frank Buchman. The first international conference was held in Switzerland, and the one held this summer in the United States was the second conference. There were participants from 30 countries, with 1,500 representatives, of which 14 were Chinese. On July 7, it opened in Pasadena, California; on July 19, a meeting was held in Hollywood; thereafter, an international representative training conference was held in Monterey Peninsula; this newspaper has recorded its grand occasion. It is now heard that the Chinese representatives have returned to Shanghai, and will continue their efforts for the Moral Rearmament movement. As a reporter concerned with the welfare of humanity and the Chinese nation, I hope that this movement will achieve substantial and great results.

The nature of the Moral Rearmament movement transcends national, racial, and class boundaries. It is currently being initiated by the Christian Church as the center of the movement, but its significance also transcends the boundaries of religion. Its stated principles are extremely high, and its target is extremely broad. However, the beginning of the movement comes from small actions in one's own life. The standard of living it sets is fourfold: absolute honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love. The primary task is to reform oneself, and then extend this to others. Therefore, the movement's goals are threefold: new individuals, a new nation, and a new world. In terms of the theoretical basis and program, it is similar to the ancient sages' meaning of being sincere in one's intentions, rectifying one's heart, cultivating one's character, managing one's family, governing one's state, and bringing peace to all under heaven; it also particularly aligns with Chairman Chiang's New Life Movement. All movements that are based on truth and justice, and that embrace the goal of benefiting the people and saving the world, not only do not contradict each other, but also lead to the same destination by different paths. The New Life Movement is advocated from above, and the Moral Rearmament movement is promoted from below, and both take personal practice as the creed of effectiveness.

Whether one is honest or not lies in one's intention. Whether something is right or wrong, good or evil, is discerned by knowledge. In terms of intention, who does not begin with sincerity? In terms of knowledge, who does not distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil? However, among the multitude of people, there are vast discrepancies in morality. This is because some people, due to a selfish thought, only seek to benefit themselves, and find that being honest is disadvantageous or inconvenient to themselves, and that doing good is disadvantageous or inconvenient to themselves. Therefore, they betray their sincerity and do wrong. Those who can disregard gains and losses, and are sincere from beginning to end, and are committed to doing good, are moral people who adhere to the creed of personal practice. In short, without personal practice, there is no way to demonstrate sincerity, which is the same as being dishonest. Without personal practice, there is no way to clarify knowledge, which is the same as being ignorant. This is true for individuals, for the society formed by interactions between people, and for the international community formed by interactions between countries. It has been said that during the year since the launch of the Moral Rearmament movement, there was a story in Europe: Bill Rowl, a British man, was the leader of more than 400,000 unemployed workers. After being unemployed for seven years, he deeply resented the privileged class and cursed capitalism. However, calling on the masses and shouting in the streets only revealed the contradictions of the real society. The suffering in his heart was even greater than the pain of unemployment, and he wandered around unable to find a solution. Then, there was Phillip More, a nobleman who was dissatisfied with the greed and corruption of the privileged class. He was moved to deeply enter the ranks of the unemployed, spending three weeks day and night with Bill Rowl, sharing his heart and soul, and sharing his joys and sorrows. Finally, they both discovered the futility of resentment and recognized that the key lies in absolute honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love. Self-examination and personal practice can reveal the light, happiness, and value of life. This conclusion spread far and wide and became a popular story, greatly promoting the Moral Rearmament movement.

While Europeans and Americans see it as a good story, Chinese society may not be able to sense its underlying meaning. Upon careful observation of general Chinese society, one can find signs of moral denial, which is even more pronounced in urban areas, especially among shallow young people with a smattering of knowledge. These people are not unaware of the terms and theories of morality, but they do not believe that there are truly moral people and events, nor do they take morality as the guide for their behavior. Instead, they believe that it is acceptable to deceive and feign, and they take selfishness and self-interest as a matter of course. They do not see this as their own immorality and imagine that everyone else is equally immoral. Even worse, they consider being good at deception and being skilled at pursuing personal gain as the secret to success in life. These people are not all in cities, nor are they all young, nor do they make up a large proportion of the general population, but if they are not stopped, not attacked, and not corrected, then they may become a habit and spread like a contagious disease. For this reason, we especially hope that those who engage in the Moral Rearmament movement will practice it personally and achieve practical and great results!

### German Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Acknowledges Hope for Peace Not Extinguished; Hopes Neutral Countries Can Mediate; US Statement States No Formal Request Received from Germany

Berlin: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman announced yesterday afternoon that a possible mediation to end the war might still have a glimmer of hope, but the German side will no longer offer guarantees or suggestions. Chamberlain clearly stated in his recent speech that the British government no longer trusts Germany's suggestions, and under these circumstances, continuing to make suggestions would be futile. The spokesman concluded that if a possible mediation is carried out, then Germany and all countries participating in the war should implement the same demobilization, and the participating countries must accept the same conditions before mediation can begin. (Haitong dispatch from the 15th)

Washington: According to President Roosevelt's secretary, O'Leary, Germany has not formally invited the United States to mediate the war in Europe. According to the headlines in New York newspapers, many prominently featured "The United States Disregards Germany's Request for Mediation." However, according to O'Leary, this headline is not in line with the facts, because Germany has not actually requested the President of the United States to mediate the European war.

### Firm Belief in Wartime Goals in British and French Public Opinion; Do Not Be Deceived by Germany's False Peace; Neutral Countries' Press Praises British Prime Minister's Remarks

London. The "Observer" today carries an article by Mr. Calvin, stating that Britain and France have now resorted to force to defend the world from the tyranny and treachery of barbarians. Before the terror is eliminated, even if it is stopped immediately, Mr. Calvin urges the Allied countries to adhere to their position and not accept a false peace, saying that a truly fair and lasting peace must be built in an international conference. However, this conference should be broader and wiser than the victorious countries' conference hastily convened more than 20 years ago. The principles needed have been outlined in the speeches by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier last week. However, we should not call their declarations a rejection of Hitler's peace proposals, because the conditions proposed by Mr. Hitler are a carefully planned conspiracy, the purpose of which is none other than to maintain his gains and plunge democratic countries into a state of eternal ruin. Mr. Calvin also mentions the documents published in the British Blue Book to prove his arguments, saying that by looking at the contents of these documents, it is clear that Mr. Hitler has a double plan: on the one hand, to destroy Poland, and on the other hand, to lure democratic countries into his trap. However, we, the British Allies, and the whole world, had already seen through this conspiracy before the outbreak of the war, and so on. (Reuters, 15th)

Paris. The opinions of the Paris newspapers all believe that the neutral countries do not take the threat of Germany and the Soviet Union seriously. "Superior News" states that the determination of the Allied countries and the increase in military strength have restored confidence in the small countries and expressed satisfaction with the firmness of the will of Britain and France. "Times" states that Britain and France have won the unanimous support of world opinion, and although Hitler has used all kinds of tricks in the past month, no country has fallen into his trap. (Reuters, 15th)

London. Neutral countries' newspapers commented on British Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent speech in the House of Commons, praising him and agreeing with the attitude taken by the Allied governments. Many parties said that Hitler's words were untrustworthy, which was the main obstacle to peace. Portugal's "Voice News" said that Hitler's peace offer was still based on a foundation that Britain and France could not accept with honor. Sofia's "Slovo News" solemnly stated that Britain and France were determined to oppose force, and praised Chamberlain's peace efforts. The Swiss newspapers discussed the results of the declarations of Hitler, Daladier, and Chamberlain, and almost unanimously said that peace now depends on Germany behaving itself. The Swedish "Lining Daily News" reviewed the overall situation and said that one thing can now be decided: Germany is now rapidly heading for destruction and will eventually be disappointed. Denmark's "Social

### Italy's Attitude Towards the European War Is One of Observation, Encouraging the Formation of a Neutral Bloc in Southeastern Europe to Prevent the Continued Expansion of Soviet Influence

Rome. The Italian government is striving to maintain an attitude of observation towards the current war in Europe, while at the same time stepping up preparations in military and economic terms to be able to cope with all contingencies. However, general public opinion believes that Italy may not be able to maintain its current favorable policy of neutrality for long, and that it may not act as a mediator in the peace offensive launched by German leader Hitler. Judging from the fact that the two Allied countries, Britain and France, refused to negotiate on the basis of accepting the accomplished fact, it is known that it is very difficult to find a solution acceptable to both belligerents for the time being. However, if the scope of the war expands, it will also be unfavorable to Italy. Therefore, Italy is still doing everything possible to prevent the war from expanding. The Italian government is now working hard to encourage the countries of the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River Basin to form a neutral bloc, on the one hand to maintain peace, and on the other hand to resist the political or ideological expansion of communism in those countries. Among them, Hungary and Romania are conducting negotiations under the aegis of Yugoslavia, and are to some extent encouraged by Italy. This is the first step in organizing a neutral bloc. Romania and Bulgaria will also hold talks in the near future, and it is expected that Italy will play an important role at that time. In addition, according to Italy's broad plan, Spain should also be asked to join the neutral bloc. If this action is realized, a very large neutral front with anti-Bolshevik tendencies will be formed from the Balkan Peninsula in the east to the western Mediterranean in the west. (Havas, 15th)
civil newspaper" viewed the British Prime Minister's speech as clearly rejecting Hitler's peace proposal without using strong words. The newspaper also believed that the speech did not reject all negotiations, but stipulated the specifics of what peace could achieve. (Reuters, 14th)

### The Soviet Union Demands the Cession of Three Small Islands from Finland; Finnish Delegation Returned Home Yesterday for Instructions; Will Also Attend the Four-Nation Nordic Conference

Moscow. The Finnish representatives and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov negotiated on the issue between the Soviet Union and Finland yesterday, and an agreement was reached last night. After dinner, the Finnish representatives returned to the Finnish capital at 0:30 this morning to report the results of the meeting to the government authorities. They will come here again soon. Well-informed sources expect the Soviet Union to demand three islands in the Gulf of Finland from Finland. They do not believe that the Soviet Union's demands will mention a military alliance. (Associated Press, 15th)

Finnish Capital. The Finnish delegation, led by Ambassador Basikivi to Sweden, returned to the country last night after holding talks with the Soviet authorities again in Moscow today. According to a message issued by the semi-official Finnish News Agency, the delegation's return to the country does not mean that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland have broken down. According to the Swedish capital's "Aftonbladet," the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland have involved the issue of re-establishing defenses on the island of Åland. The Soviet government believes that if Finland can sign a political agreement with the Soviet government, it will no longer oppose the establishment of defenses on the island of Åland. (According to the Baltic Sea's island of Åland, which is located between Sweden and Finland, at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia, and is sufficient to control the Gulf of Finland, its geographical position is extremely important. It is regulated by international conventions that no defensive works can be set up as a military base.) (Havas, 14th)

Swedish Capital. Today, a telegram was received here from the Finnish capital, stating that although the Finnish government cannot announce the details of the Soviet proposals, it feels that it can continue to discuss them with the Soviet Union. According to general impressions, the discussions between the Soviet Union and Finland will last for a week or more. The Finnish government is now aware of the content of the Soviet proposals and has not shown any signs of panic. The general public is gradually becoming optimistic. However, Finland's precautionary measures are still in progress.

Everyone hopes that Finland's chief representative, Basikivi, will return to Moscow in the coming days, and that a satisfactory compromise can be reached after the discussions. At the same time, the Finnish newspapers all stated that Finland has resolved to reject all conditions that would damage the country's honor, integrity, and independence. According to news from Moscow, observers there believe that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland can be concluded satisfactorily. (Reuters, 14th)

### Soviet Demands Include Four Items

Swedish Capital. According to as-yet-unconfirmed news from Finland, the Soviet Union's greatest ambitions for Finland include four items: (1) Three small islands opposite the port of Kronstadt and the island of Hogland (the Finnish residents of which have already been evacuated) should be ceded to the Soviet Union. The port of Hanko in the southwest should be leased to the Soviet Union. (2) Regarding the issue of fortifications on the Åland Islands, there is a joint consensus: (A) The Soviet Union requires that the Soviet Union and Finland jointly build fortifications. (B) Finland can build fortifications alone, but on the condition that the Soviet Union and Finland carry out extensive cooperation politically. (3) The Soviet Union and Finland conclude a mutual assistance treaty. (4) Finland's export trade should be organized by the Soviet Union. It is rumored that the Soviet Union will not put forward conditions in the style of an ultimatum. For the time being, the above four items will be the basis for continuing negotiations with Finland. As for the compensation measures that the Soviet Union can offer, the country will cede a small part of the coastal area of Karelia to Finland, and allow the country to use the Soviet Union's Ladoga Lake canal to the White Sea for commercial purposes. (Havas, 15th)

Danish Capital. A reporter from the Maritime News Agency learned tonight from well-informed sources that the Soviet Union has made the following demands on Finland: (1) Finland cedes the islands of Tytärsaari, Lavansaari, Seiskari to the Soviet Union (the island of Suursaari may also be ceded). After Finland cedes the above islands, the Soviet Union will provide territorial compensation in Eastern Karelia. (2) Finland guarantees that it will not build fortifications on the Åland Islands and recognizes that the Soviet Union enjoys temporary control over the islands in order to verify that the islands are not fortified. (3) A military alliance between the Soviet Union and Finland. If Finland is threatened by an unprovoked attack by a third country, the Soviet Union not only has the right to use all its forces to defend Finland, but also has the obligation to defend Finland.

The islands of Tytärsaari, Lavansaari, Seiskari, and Suursaari are all located near the Soviet coast in the Gulf of Finland. Eastern Karelia is Soviet territory bordering Finland's eastern frontier, and its residents are Finnish. After Finland cedes the islands, it will receive territorial compensation in Eastern Karelia.

Finland already has a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. Erkko continued, saying that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland have reached a critical juncture. Only the four members of Finland's wartime cabinet, as well as the Finnish President and Chief of Staff, are aware of the plan under consideration. The Foreign Minister declared that he believed that the United States had a very good friendship with Finland. "President Roosevelt's letter to Moscow will be a powerful factor in resolving the current dispute." He said that although the government is prepared to move elsewhere if necessary, his family intends to remain in the Finnish capital. (Associated Press, 15th)

Riga. Germany and Latvia signed the first draft agreement yesterday on the negotiations for the withdrawal of German overseas Chinese in Latvian territory and the German minority in Latvia, stipulating that the first batch of 480 German overseas Chinese will be allowed to leave Latvia and return home first.

Riga. The talks between Germany and Latvia on the repatriation of Germans in Latvian territory are nearing completion. The Latvian government has submitted a draft agreement for the German government to consider. The draft is based on two principles: (1) Every German Latvian citizen voluntarily declares whether he is willing to lose his Latvian citizenship and obtain German public rights. If he decides to do so, he will not be allowed to return to Latvia. (2) It is undoubtedly permissible for Germans returning to Germany to take daily necessities out of the country, but movable property with special value and related to Latvia's economic life is prohibited from being taken away.

The official formal announcement will be issued after the German submarine commander returns. (Associated Press, 15th)

London. Naval sources claimed that they were not surprised by the sinking of HMS Royal Oak, as the ship was one of the oldest in the Navy. Such old ships often sail in more dangerous places, but they do not deny the new victory won by the German submarine. "Although HMS Royal Oak was an old ship that had been in use for 25 years, it was one of the Navy's 'sea fortresses' and was considered to be unable to be sunk by the power of ordinary submarines. It had special anti-mine devices. It participated in the Battle of Jutland in the last war and has recently been listed in the Navy's reserve fleet. It rejoined the service in June, commanded by Colonel Benn. In this disaster, Colonel Benn and Lieutenant Colonel Nichols were rescued. (Associated Press, 15th)

The air defense authorities did not issue an alarm, and the anti-aircraft artillery fired fiercely for two hours. At that time, explosions occurred in several places, but the authorities did not allow the radio stations to announce where the locations were. In addition, newspapers in the Swedish capital carried a telegram from a reporter stationed in Berlin stating, "At 9:00 p.m. last night, anti-aircraft fire in Berlin was heavy, and searchlights searched the sky. Residents were terrified and looked out from the windows. It is said that several planes were seen passing over the northern suburbs." The British Air Ministry solemnly denied all of this.

(Associated Press, 15th)

London. According to the British Air Ministry's statement to the Associated Press reporter today, the rumors that there was an aircraft of unknown nationality over Berlin last night were related to the British Air Force. The Air Ministry had no knowledge of this. (Associated Press, 15th)

### Western Front German Forces Complete Offensive Preparations New German Troops Arrive at Siegfried Line Artillery Battles Southwest of Saarbrücken

London According to reports from neutral observers, Berlin is now prepared in every way to move Hitler's office to the Western Front. The offensive by German forces may begin by the end of this week. The necessary preliminary attacks have almost been completed. French observers also say that new troops have arrived at the Siegfried Line. A large number of German troops are gathered at the corner formed by Luxembourg, the Moselle, and the Rhine, ready to launch an offensive at any time. However, the area is narrow and mountainous, making a long, direct advance difficult. Furthermore, the French defenses are strong. If the German forces attack from there, the price they pay will definitely be shockingly high. Therefore, some observers predict that the German forces will attack simultaneously through the Netherlands and Switzerland in order to分散 the Allied powers' resistance. Currently, the German position seems to be divided. The biggest factor determining everything is the internal situation in Germany. The domestic population now hopes for significant developments. However, whatever decision Hitler makes, the British and French commanders have confidence that they can inflict heavy damage on the German forces. The command and training of the British and French armies are considered superior to that of the German forces. The equipment of the British and French armies is at least equal to that of the German forces, and the French trenches and fortifications from Lauterbourg to the Siegfried Line are even stronger than during the last World War. (Reuters, 14th)

London Reuters military correspondent reports that the "probing" war on the Western Front could turn into a major war at any time, and the stubborn German military may drive large forces to attack the Allied defense lines. However, it is difficult to solve the problem of when and where the mechanized units gathered behind the front line can be moved out to attack points where resistance is weaker than it is now. Currently, due to rainy and foggy weather, there is little activity. The German forces were quite active before the strikes, aiming to discover the location of the British Expeditionary Force and British aircraft, but this activity has now decreased and ultimately failed to achieve anything. The correspondent heard from extremely reliable sources that Germany must leave at least twenty divisions stationed in Poland. Young conscripts belonging to the National Socialist Party have now been transferred to the Western Front. However, the German army now has many shortcomings not seen in the German army of Emperor Wilhelm in 1914. The German army has expanded from seven divisions to ninety divisions in four years, so there is a severe shortage of experienced officers, while the British and French have more experienced officers than before. (Reuters, 14th)

British Army Positions in French Territory France's strong defense line today is truly the only great construction after the Great Wall of China. British army units have joined the fighting on this line, stationed in important locations between the English Channel and Switzerland. A reporter visited the front lines of the British army positions. Every few yards along the way, there was a small fort made of steel and cement. Such facilities were only found in a few places in the Verdun positions during the last World War. British troops on the front lines are all digging trenches to build even stronger defenses. Farmers continue to farm. I met an optimistic farmer in one place, scattering seeds for next year. (Associated Press, 15th)

Paris General Headquarters has just released war bulletin number eighty-one, stating, "Enemy reconnaissance units were very active today in the area west of the Saar River and south of Zweibrücken. They were all repelled by our forces. In addition, there was heavy artillery fire between both sides southwest of Saarbrücken." (Havas, 14th)

Amsterdam A correspondent from a local newspaper in Berlin reports that general opinion in Germany is that Germany will strive to avoid a large-scale conflict, so there will be extremely important decisions made during the next week. The correspondent also states that what Germany welcomes most at the moment is the cessation of any major oppressive threat from the Western Front. (Reuters, 15th)

Berlin The German High Command issued a communiqué this afternoon stating briefly that there were no changes in the Eastern Front situation, and there was a slight artillery battle on the Western Front. Near Breitenfeldt, German forces shot down an aircraft on the 13th. There was no significant activity by either side's air forces on the 14th. (Haitong, 15th)

### Warsaw After the War Gradually Returns to Normal

Berlin A correspondent from a German newspaper stationed in Warsaw, having returned to the city, sent a report today on the situation in Warsaw after the war, stating briefly that life in Warsaw is now gradually returning to normal under German administration. Obstacles hindering traffic, barbed wire, etc., have all been removed, and ditches have also been filled in. The most difficult problem, drinking water, has been solved by the German authorities. Engineers are repairing water pipes everywhere. There are no problems with the water supply in the main areas of the city. Electricity is available in several areas, and buses can be used. Railway traffic is gradually recovering. Freight cars loaded with grain arrive in Warsaw every day, so wartime prices have gradually decreased. City traffic has not yet fully recovered. Only two bus routes are in operation, but trams have not yet returned. According to the correspondent, the German authorities are currently engaged in relief work, hoping to restore normal conditions this winter. (Haitong, 15th)

### French Air Force Activity Limited to Reconnaissance Has Not Yet Engaged in Bombing

Paris The authorities have recently announced the activities of the French Air Force since the start of the war, measuring and reconnaissance, never engaged in bombing. German aircraft have also not bombed French territory, but only engaged in reconnaissance. However, their reconnaissance planes are often intercepted by our fighter planes shortly after leaving their base, so they have not been able to complete their mission. Our reconnaissance planes, day and night, penetrate deep into German airspace to carry out reconnaissance. From the third of last month to the seventh of this month, daytime reconnaissance totaled more than two hundred times, and nighttime reconnaissance totaled sixty times. Although enemy fighter planes have attacked, our planes have still been able to take many photos of the German Siegfried Line and German military positions, and have been able to report the concentration of German troops to our General Headquarters. In a word, the results are extremely good. As for the air combat situation between the enemy and our forces, our pilots have excellent skills, and the quality of our aircraft is also superior to that of the enemy's. A total of twenty-four enemy planes have been shot down, and our losses are only eight planes. (Havas, 14th)

### German Finances Adapt to Wartime Needs Industrial Production Declines

Berlin According to the "German General Report," Germany has been able to meet wartime needs and maintain currency stability by using increased taxes, savings, and funds from savings banks and insurance companies. During the last World War, Germany promulgated the first wartime tax law five years after the outbreak of the war. Three-quarters of the war expenses, amounting to a huge sum of 130,000,000,000 marks, were paid with public debt. The current German budget has implemented savings and reduced various non-essential expenditures. According to Deputy Finance Minister Lienhardt, the issuance of wartime public debt is not currently being considered. Germany is good at issuing treasury bonds, absorbing excess funds, and supplying war expenses, and the amount of paper money in circulation will not increase significantly due to wartime needs. People's savings are also not threatened due to the stability of wages and prices. (Haitong, 15th)

New York A certain German economist published an article in the steel industry publication "Iron Age," predicting that the German industrial system would collapse in four to eight months due to a lack of raw materials and exorbitant labor costs. He said that Germany lacks important raw materials such as pig iron, fuel, machinery, gasoline, copper, wheat, and cotton, and that domestic workers are fatigued and undernourished, resulting in a gradual decrease in the per capita output of various manufactured goods or raw materials. (Reuters, 14th)

Vienna German Economics Minister Funk delivered a speech here yesterday to representatives of the industrial sector, discussing Germany's wartime economy, declaring that Britain's blockade policy had completely failed, that the German people's economic life had not been affected in the slightest, and that Germany not only had other ways to obtain the raw materials it needed, but also had domestic substitutes, so that it would not be completely dependent on foreign supplies. In addition to military "armament expansion," the German government also had economic "armament expansion," increasing relations with Southeastern European countries to ensure that even if the war was prolonged, Germany could maintain 80% of its peacetime foreign trade." (Haitong, 15th)

### British Merchant Ship Convoy System Successful British Ships That Have Been Convoied Have Never Suffered Aerial Attacks

London Germany now admits that the submarine warfare aimed at destroying British shipping has been defeated by the convoy system, but says that German aircraft can make up for the shortcomings of submarines. According to observers here, since Britain implemented the convoy system, ships that have been convoyed have never suffered aerial attacks, showing that Germany's claim that aerial bombing can sweep away British maritime power has not become a reality. As for the claim that British destroyers are intercepting and searching Japanese ships in Japanese territorial waters, it is even more absurd. After exercising maritime power for hundreds of years, the British naval authorities would never neglect their duties and deliberately offend a country that has declared strict neutrality. (Reuters, 14th)

London The Information Department recently stated that British ships now entering and leaving British ports are protected at sea by the British Air Force for hundreds of miles. Even in the past few weeks, when there have been storms and rain and poor visibility, the escort work of British reconnaissance planes has not been greatly interrupted. When there are heavy storms and rain, the British planes escorting merchant ships sometimes fly very low, and the crew members watch the sea and sky. As soon as they see a submarine, they drop bombs to drive it away, and they notify British warships to sail to the location and drop depth charges again. (Reuters, 14th)

Danzig It is now known that four German pilots landed yesterday in the Rugpin area. The plane they were flying had been shot down by British planes. It is said that this German plane initially fought with British planes outside British territorial waters and then, unable to withstand the attack of the British planes, landed off the Danish coast. At that time, the British plane signaled to a Danish ship to rescue the German pilots who had fallen into the sea. (Reuters, 14th)

### British and French Aircraft Production Exceeds Germany

London An Information Department statement said that it can now be predicted that when the industrial mobilization of Britain and France is completed, they will be able to build five times more aircraft than usual. This is a fact and not an overly optimistic exaggeration. Even if Germany accelerates the production of its aircraft factories to the extreme limit, the aircraft produced by Britain and France will still be three times that of Germany. The French aircraft industry will soon employ more than 300,000 workers. The statement mentioned the situation in the Western Front, saying that neither French nor German aircraft have dropped a single bomb in the Western Front. (Reuters, 14th)

### German Aircraft Flies Over Dutch Airspace

### US Congress to Discuss Two-Ocean Navy Plan Navy Department Collects Various Materials

Washington Judging by various events, the US Congress will discuss the US two-ocean navy plan at its next meeting, that is, to defend the coastlines of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at the same time. The Navy Department is now studying the convenience of public and private shipyards in realizing this plan and will submit the materials obtained to a special committee of Congress for research. It is said that the Navy does not hope to split the US Navy in two, fearing that Congress will question the truth of the matter, so it first starts with collecting facts. Furthermore, the US two-ocean navy plan was generated because of the European war. According to the views of some strategists, the United States should first concentrate its fleet in the Pacific and then quickly build up its fleet in the Atlantic. (Associated Press, 15th)

### American Security Zone Must Not Be Violated Senator Pepper Talks

Washington Democratic Senator Pepper stated today that the security zone stipulated in the Panama Declaration should be fully patrolled and policed by American democratic nations so that the warring nations recognize that the American nations are not easy to deal with. "If the warships of the warring nations deliberately violate the American security zone, they should be detained. In fact, however, I believe that all submarines, cruisers, and other warships that violate this security zone should be sunk." The Panama Declaration has clearly stated that if the warships of the warring nations violate this area, the warring nations themselves must bear the responsibility for the danger. (Associated Press, 15th)

### Japan Hopes US Will Initiate Renewal of Commercial Treaty

Tokyo According to Ginjiro Fujiwara, chairman of the Japan Industrial Federation, who recently arrived in the United States from Europe, speaking to a reporter from the Nichinichi Shimbun, Japan should not immediately contact the United States to renew a new commercial treaty at present. Fujiwara asked Japanese businessmen to prepare for the complete abolition of the Japan-US commercial treaty and to wait quietly for the time to ripen to sign a new commercial treaty with the United States. Fujiwara believes that Japan does not need to rush to sign a new Japan-US commercial treaty. It is best for the United States to initiate it, not Japan. In any case, Japan must grit its teeth and wait for the opportunity to come. Moreover, when the United States initiates a request to Japan to sign a new commercial treaty, if the conditions it proposes do not satisfy the Japanese side, the Japanese side can reject them until satisfactory conditions are obtained. (Associated Press, 15th)

### German Labor Exchanges Established in Polish Territory

Berlin An official from the German Labor Department published an article in the "German Labor Report" describing the achievements of the German labor exchanges in Polish territory. These exchanges were quickly established in various parts of Poland following the German army. On the third day after the outbreak of the war, a German labor exchange was established in Rybnik in Upper Silesia, Poland. By September 8, the number of exchanges had increased to nineteen. It increased to thirty on September 18, and to seventy at the end of September. Currently, there are a total of 115. Polish farmers were transported to various parts of Germany at the end of September to help with the autumn harvest. As of October 14, there were a total of 120,000 Polish farmers in Germany. Technical workers from the industrial areas of Upper Silesia and Olsza have been assigned to wartime industrial workers. (Haitong, 15th)

### US Isolationist Congressmen Propose Requesting British and French Territories to Offset War Debts A Heated Debate in the Senate

Washington In yesterday's Senate meeting, because isolationists proposed asking Britain and France to cede their territories in the Western Hemisphere to the United States as compensation for war debts, Minnesota Senator Lundeen, an extreme isolationist, said, "If those Allied nations do not repay their war debts, the United States will send troops to occupy the West Indies." North Carolina Democratic Senator Reynolds even proposed occupying Newfoundland and part of Canada. Texas Democratic Senator Connally immediately rose to attack those isolationists, saying that they wanted to drag the United States into the whirlpool of war. Kentucky Democratic Senator Barkley called the isolationists' remarks "cowardly," "Why not do it in peacetime, but want to seize it during wartime?" Washington Democratic Senator Schwellenbach said that this was similar to Molotov's demands on the Baltic states. North Dakota Republican Senator Frazier attacked the neutrality law amendment proposed by President Roosevelt again, saying that this amendment would drag the United States into the war. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman issued a formal document yesterday attacking the remarks of aviator Lindbergh. (Associated Press, 15th)

### Under the Heavy Burden of War, Cracks Appear in the Japanese Economy

The *Millard's Review* recently published an article by John Ahlers regarding the economic strain Japan is experiencing during its invasion of China. A translation is provided below:

Japanese militarists have formulated a model for Japan's economic policy, primarily aimed at promoting the military, both domestically and on the Asian continent. This policy is becoming increasingly solidified. Although the Hiranuma Cabinet fell six weeks ago, its economic policies continue to be implemented. This is because Aokii, the president of the Planning Board and a key representative of this policy, has recently been appointed Minister of Finance. It's clear that Aokii is neither an independent economist nor a representative of Japanese big business, but rather a tool of the military. He may even rise to the level of an active duty commander within the General Staff.

The current Minister of the Army, Shunroku Hata, has made sweeping changes among key military personnel within the Army Ministry and various Japanese Army commands. This suggests that the military figures dominating affairs in Tokyo are not likely to gain any new perspectives on the Japanese economy. The military, accustomed to commanding soldiers and seeing them blindly obey, completely fails to understand that it's impossible to similarly command industry, goods, prices, exchange rates, and other economic elements without creating chaos. For two years, the military has attempted to reshape the Japanese economy, altering its foundations and structure, forcing it to develop in a one-sided manner, establishing more war industries, and restricting development in other areas. As the war against China progresses, the military's demands on the economy and its interference have steadily increased, leading to growing economic difficulties for Japan. The military appears to be blind to this fact. The Abe government has only just begun to take new action on one aspect of the economy. Many knowledgeable Japanese people are aware that Japan's economic difficulties are increasing daily. Hiranuma had prohibited all public reporting on Japan's economic hardship, absolutely forbidding newspapers from publishing the true problems facing Japan. However, the new Prime Minister, Abe, seems to feel that the difficulties are so numerous that they can no longer be ignored. In fact, Abe seems to have decided to publicize these difficulties so that the Japanese people can prepare for another major sacrifice. Apparently for this reason, the financial sections of major Japanese newspapers are filled with news of increasing shortages of goods, with little other news. They also explicitly state the need for further restrictions on civilian consumption and tighter government economic controls. These reports give the impression that things were going relatively smoothly under Hiranuma's rule, but under Abe's administration, Japan's economic situation seems to be worsening. This impression is, of course, inaccurate, as Abe is simply revealing what his predecessor had concealed. However, the full truth about Japan's economic and financial straits has yet to be announced. In the initial stages of its invasion of China, the Japanese people readily accepted restrictions. Millions of obedient Japanese people discarded leather shoes and returned to wearing traditional wooden clogs. They wore clothing made of mixed fibers without much complaint and managed to forgo familiar imported goods. The masses' lives were not greatly affected by the war. The entire nation expected a quick, easy, and inexpensive victory over China, as promised by the military. They not only expected all economic abnormalities to disappear soon, but also looked forward to a steady stream of war spoils and an economic boom. However, after more than two years of war, economic improvement has remained elusive. Worse still, the existing economic difficulties have gradually increased. It is only natural that the Japanese masses are beginning to express genuine alarm about the situation.

Now, Abe has allowed the controlled press to publicly disclose material shortages, which deeply affect the daily lives of every Japanese person. Restrictions must be placed on household consumption of coal, electricity, gas, and paper. The Japanese Empire has also begun to clearly understand the shortage of food. Rice, sugar, eggs, and canned goods are now being rationed to the public daily by the government. The price level rose sharply in August and September, but ordinances have prohibited increases in wages and salaries at a time when they have not yet been adjusted to the new price level. Although newspapers continue to carry illusory reports of victories in China, they cannot dispel the despairing situation that Japan finds itself in. It is no longer easy to hope that the Japanese people will feel that this news compensates for the new difficulties they are experiencing.

The Abe Cabinet has implemented new economic control regulations, with the number of regulations far exceeding the number of days since the new Abe government took office. The new forms of restrictions are the same. Regarding the newly controlled goods, the Army and Navy departments first requisition the supplies they need or believe they will need. When allocating the remaining items, war industries have a definite priority. The worst affected are peacetime industries and civilian consumption. However, it is peacetime industries and peaceful consumption that truly support Japan. The electricity supply to the textile industry, which has long suffered, has been greatly reduced, resulting in a sharp drop in the production of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and rayon in recent weeks. The daytime electricity supply to spinning mills in the Nagoya area has been completely cut off. Its operations have had to be limited to midnight, when the general public's need for electricity is minimal. The government, which had long opposed the merger of textile factories, is now suddenly encouraging it. As a result, some factories may close, while the remaining ones will be transformed into new, first-class factories. The newspapers are now urging civilians to become "greater and better patriots," tighten their belts, go to bed early, not burn too many lights, and economize on everything. However, everyone must save even more money and deposit it in savings banks so that the Ministry of Finance can use these funds to subscribe to war and national debt bonds. An imperial ordinance issued on October 6 aims to curb the recent rise in prices. According to these orders, all prices, such as wages, salaries, rent, and freight, must not exceed the levels of September 18. The government reserves the right to permit exceptions to exceed this level. These sudden measures are based on a request made by former Minister of the Army Itagaki months ago, despite the strong opposition of Ikeda, Chairman of the Central Commodity Committee, the former Minister of Finance and a close associate of Matsui. Ikeda is now an outstanding representative of Japan's private high finance sector. This indicates that the military has finally prevailed over Ikeda and shows what forces control the Abe government's economic policies. However, the new price control plan will absolutely not cure the root cause of rising prices, so it is bound to fail. The government accuses merchants of hoarding and raising prices for speculative purposes, which may be partly true. However, there are many fundamental reasons for the recent surge in prices in Japan. The main reasons are that the general public has become aware of the increasing shortage of goods in Japan, the depreciation of the yen following the pound, and the increasing trend of inflation. At the end of last month, prices in Japan rose to the highest level since the outbreak of the war, and the amount of banknotes in circulation at the Bank of Japan reached a new high for the year, exceeding 2.6 billion yen. These two events are certainly not coincidental. The official announcement by the Bank of Japan of currency reserves is 500.1 million yen. Many well-informed sources believe that these reserves have already been depleted. Even if the Bank of Japan still has 500.1 million yen in reserves, the yen's reserves have fallen to 12%, far less than half of the legal tender reserves based on the current exchange rate in Shanghai.

Japanese militarists do not understand that it is not the Japanese economy that is creating the difficulties, but rather the military situation they themselves have created that has exacerbated Japan's economic hardship. Because the mass production of military supplies to supply the domestic and Chinese land and naval forces, the productive peacetime industries are subordinate to the unproductive wartime industries. Thus Japan is experiencing a shortage of goods. Japan is currently financing its adventurous war in China through continuous expansion of national debt. This is the reason for Japanese inflation. The fundamental cause of Japan's economic hardship is the Chinese war. This has placed an unbearable burden on the Japanese economy. Japanese militarists are attempting to accomplish what their nation's economic structure and resources cannot support. This is why the previously stable Japanese economy now shows dangerous cracks. The actions of the Japanese militarists are indeed too reckless.

### Singapore Government Restricts Import of Goods, a Total of Thirty-Four Items Intended to Control Foreign Exchange

A Hong Kong dispatch: In recent years, Chinese manufacturers have shipped a large volume of goods to Singapore and other ports in Southeast Asia for sale. However, since the outbreak of the European war, the Singapore government has suddenly announced a ban on the import of thirty-four categories of goods. Manufacturers in Hong Kong are greatly concerned about this, as most of the products made in Hong Kong are sold in Singapore and the islands of Southeast Asia. Once imports are banned, it would be equivalent to placing manufacturers in a death trap. Therefore, they have been sending telegrams to their agents in Singapore to inquire about the details. Yesterday, the manager of a factory said that he had received a report from Singapore stating that this move by the Straits Settlements government was merely a step to assist in controlling foreign exchange. Merchants in the area who wish to handle Hong Kong goods only need to obtain a permit from the import and export bureau, and they can handle the goods as usual without any difficulties. In reality, the local government does not completely prohibit the import of these thirty-four categories of goods, but only imposes certain restrictions. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Manufacturers Association has called a special meeting to discuss countermeasures. The attendees were very enthusiastic. The thirty-four categories of restricted goods are listed in detail below: (1) Taxable beverages and tobacco, (2) Animals not for food, (3) Non-metallic minerals and petroleum-based minerals, (4) Raw cotton, (5) Other textile raw materials, (6) Pottery, glass, and non-cement and glass jars, etc., (7) Non-iron products, etc., (8) Electrical appliances, (9) Machinery, (10) Cotton thread and products, (11) Wool products, (12) Silk and silk fabrics, (13) Other textile manufacturing raw materials, excluding Manila hemp, (14) Clothing, (15) Pharmaceuticals, (16) Leather and products, (17) Vehicles, (18) Rubber products, (19) Bracelets, (20) Artificial pearls, (21) Furniture, (22) Antiques, (23) All cosmetic products, (24) Artificial flowers, (25) Gold thread, (26) Imitation gold and silver leaf, (27) Jewels and goldsmith supplies, (28) Paint supplies, (29) Lamps and lanterns, etc., (30) Various musical supplies, (31) Perfumes, powders, etc., (32) Paintings, (33) Silversmith supplies, (34) Silver thread, etc.

Furthermore, regarding item 15 in the table, the scope of "pharmaceuticals" reportedly only refers to manufactured drugs, and does not include raw Chinese medicinal materials.

### Suzhou People Suffering from Extreme Hardship

High Prices Make Life Difficult

A Suzhou dispatch: Prices for various goods in Suzhou have recently skyrocketed, increasing people's consumer expenses and causing great hardship. According to investigations, the current selling prices of several daily necessities are one to two times higher than at the same time last year, and in some cases, even more than three times higher. For example, kerosene was selling for seven yuan per box last year. This year it once rose to twenty yuan and five jiao. Retail prices have also risen from twenty-odd fen to about sixty fen per jin. Although there has been some relaxation in recent days, the market price is still seventeen yuan, so the retail price is still about fifty fen per jin. As a result, many families have switched to candles or oil lamps. However, their prices have also continued to rise like kerosene. Every year, after autumn arrives, firewood and grass, made from rice straw and tree branches, can be used as fuel, so the market price should be lower this autumn. Now, however, the prices are even higher than in the summer, exceeding one time. Even thatch is in short supply. Rice straw used to be two hundred jin per yuan, but now it is only one hundred and twenty jin per yuan. Rolled tobacco, such as Pisi cigarettes, has also soared in price. As for vegetables, pork was three jin per yuan in the same period last year, but now it is only two jin and four liang per yuan. Due to a lack of raw materials, the rapeseed produced in various rural areas has been almost completely absorbed. Furthermore, the transportation of goods from Zhejiang and Anhui has been hindered, and sources are scarce, making oil production difficult. Oil is now also becoming increasingly scarce, while demand is increasing. Salt is now fifty yuan per dan at the market, and five jiao per jin for door-to-door sales. Due to transportation disruptions from the production area, goods are not easy to obtain. From the first day of the ninth lunar month, after discussion among industry members, the prices of various Shaoxing wines have been increased by two yuan and four jiao per dan, and retail prices have been increased by two fen and four li per jin. The prices for Jing Zhuang is nineteen yuan and two jiao, Bamboo Green is twenty yuan, Hua Diao is twenty-two yuan and four jiao, Aged is twenty-four yuan, Shao Jiu is twenty-one yuan and six jiao, Gaoliang is twenty-five yuan and six jiao, Yanghe is thirty-two yuan, Xilu is forty-eight yuan, Yuanliang is sixty-four yuan, Top Yuan is eighty yuan, and White Rose is twenty-six yuan and four jiao. Because the prices of daily necessities have soared, the general public is constantly complaining.

### Nanhui, the Chinese Army Recaptures Datuan

The Puppet Army of Jiang Rebels and a Japanese Army Captain is Killed

A Pudong dispatch: Since the provincial government sent Xia Lvzhao to take over as the magistrate of Nanhui County, the original magistrate Yu Taosheng and the leader of the Chuansha Guerrilla, Li Zhiming, resigned one after another. Their 8,000 troops were handed over to Ding Xishan. On the morning of the 9th, Ding's troops counterattacked Datuan. Jiang Guiqing, a former bandit recruited by the Japanese army, suddenly led his troops and shouted, "We are Chinese, rise up quickly and fight to the death with the XXXXX!" As a result, the Japanese troops occupying Datuan were cut off from front to back, unable to coordinate. Because the situation was sudden, the Japanese army could not respond and trampled on each other. Ding's troops, with Jiang's troops as their inside support, were unstoppable. They completely recaptured Datuan Town. Japanese army captain Fujimori was also killed. Jiang's troops have now been reorganized into the Ninth Detachment by Ding Xishan.

### World Shipping Market Conditions

— Qinhuai Bi

Outbreak of European War and Shipping Market Conditions

Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the long-stagnant world shipping industry has suddenly shown a reversal posture. The soaring freight and ship rentals for long-distance ocean routes are like those at the outbreak of the First European War.

The following is a list of freight rates on the world's major tramp vessel routes, which are the most sensitive to market conditions, to show the general situation of soaring prices. (Unit: Shilling)

(Note) Freight rates from the Far East to Europe and from Europe to the Far East have increased by about 20%.

Looking at the grain freight rates on the world's standard route, South America Liverpool to Europe: initially from 10 shillings to 30 shillings. According to the telegram on September 7, it will rise to 40 shillings. According to the telegram on October 11 and 2, it is said that it will soar to 50 shillings. Ship charter rates have also become active accordingly. According to the telegram on September 9, the six-month charter rate for small West Indian ferry ships in the New York market is 3 US dollars, but according to the telegram on October 11, it is said that all charter rates originally set at 1.75 US dollars are now changed to 4.75 US dollars. This surge has made the world shipping market rate more than six times hotter than before the war. In the future, it is inevitable that the sea market will continue to maintain a gradual upward pace.

As of September 18, the freight rates for the world's major routes are roughly as follows:

A. Comparison Table of Freight Rates on Major Routes Before and After the European War. The soaring freight rates on major routes can be seen in general. In short, tramp vessels have generally increased by one time, while scheduled vessels have increased from 20% to 50%. However, it is speculated that there may not be excessive changes in the future.

The European War is continuing, and governments of various countries are considering in detail the price countermeasures that should be taken to cope with the current difficulties. However, these kinds of countermeasures are fundamentally different from the policies promoted under the free economy during the First European War, which can be expected. At least like during the First World War, it would cost 600 shillings to transport rice from Saigon to Europe and 270 shillings to transport miscellaneous grains from Plata to Europe. This kind of madness is unlikely to reappear.

British Freight Countermeasures

Simultaneously with the outbreak of the European War, the British government, in order to ensure the transportation of its troops and important wartime materials, organized a chartering committee on the one hand, and took measures to deal with the wartime economy on the other hand, and made every effort to focus on suppressing prices at home. As for the soaring freight rates, it is certainly necessary to try its best to prevent and mitigate them. That is to say, for freight rates from the Philippines to New York that want to increase by 50%, only an increase of 25% is allowed; from Singapore to New York that wants to increase by 50%, only an increase of 20% is allowed; Australia to Europe 25%, Manila to Hong Kong or Shanghai is also 25%. In addition, the British government has also determined the official freight rates for grains. On the other hand, for the huge maritime relief plan proposed in Parliament on July 13 as a five-year plan, it advocated strengthening it; for the transfer of the world shipping center market from London to New York, which is sufficient to weaken the guiding position, it strongly opposed it; Therefore, the British government is engaged in strengthening work, sparing no effort, in order to impose severe sanctions on the New York market. For example, the government has officially set the freight rate for miscellaneous grains from Plata to Europe at 30 shillings, and the same is true for ship charter rates. As for the charter rate regulations for domestic ships, large ships are 7 shillings 6 pence to 6 shillings 6 pence. This is a good plan for the British government, but most shipowners are dissatisfied. Later, according to a certain intelligence, the United Kingdom will set up a Ministry of Shipping in the cabinet. Although we do not quite understand what the effect of the first institution and its operation will be, it is certainly not without reason for a major power that has fully experienced the previous world war to suddenly add this Ministry of Shipping.

Increased Maritime War Insurance Rates

In addition to the soaring freight and ship charter rates mentioned above, maritime war insurance rates are also increasing. Since the outbreak of the European War, there have been two revisions one after another. The newly revised rates are twice as high as before the war. The following are the rates from Shanghai to various places (calculated per 100): Shanghai to the British Irish Free State or Continental Europe (excluding Germany and Italy and their territories) is 2.375 yuan, Shanghai to North American Atlantic ports via Suez (including Mediterranean surcharges) is 2.875 yuan, Shanghai to North American Atlantic ports via the Cape of Good Hope is 0.875 yuan, Shanghai to North American Atlantic ports via Panama is 0.675 yuan, Shanghai to Mediterranean ports (including surcharges) is 2.750 yuan, Shanghai to the Persian Gulf (newly set) is 0.5 yuan, Shanghai to East Africa and South Africa (newly set) is 0.665 yuan, Shanghai to the Black Sea (newly set, including surcharges) is 3.75 yuan. Because the surcharge for passing through the Mediterranean has increased from 1 yuan to 2 yuan, the rate from Shanghai to London via the Mediterranean has increased from 2 yuan, 3 jiao 7 fen 5 to 4 yuan, 3 jiao 7 fen 5. Other routes to the east and west coasts of South America via the Cape of Good Hope are 8 jiao 7 fen 5, to Australia 8 jiao 7 fen 5, to the Straits Settlements India East Africa 3 jiao 7 fen 5, and to other routes and various parts of the Chinese coast 2 jiao 5. There has been no increase in the rates to Australia and Chinese ports. However, these rates do not apply to Germany, Italy, and their territories.

The outbreak of the European War has naturally increased the danger of maritime transportation, and the increase in war insurance is a natural thing. However, the simultaneous soaring of various expenses such as freight and ship charter rates will naturally have a great impact on the shipping industry, and the result will be the recurrence of a world trade recession.

Decline of Shipping Industries of Various Countries in China

Finally, let us talk about the impact of the European War on the shipping industries of various countries in China. Since the major ports of China have been blockaded by the Japanese Navy, the business of European and American shipping companies has plummeted. Not only has North China's shipping industry been completely seized by Japanese ships, but even South and Central China have been severely hit by Japanese merchants; Among them, the United Kingdom has suffered the most. Before the war, there were four major British shipping companies operating in the Yangtze River: Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Xiangtai, and Asia, with a total tonnage of 65,700 tons; In terms of the number of ships, it also accounted for 39%, ranking first. Now, the first place has been exclusively occupied by Japanese merchants. As for coastal shipping, due to the blockade by the Japanese army, business is declining day by day, with little hope for the future. The British government has repeatedly protested to the Japanese government, but not only has it had no effect, but under the promotion of anti-British policies, the prospects of British shipping in China are on the verge of bankruptcy. Now that the United Kingdom is busy with affairs in Europe, the shipping industry in the Far East is even more affected. Now, most of the British ships originally sailing to the Far East have been transferred, so Japanese shipping has become more active.

The Beiyang shipping routes are divided into: Shanghai-Hai, Shanghai-Qing, Shanghai-Tianjin, Shanghai-Liaoning, Shanghai-Yingkou, Shanghai-An regions and Qing, Hai, Yantai, Longkou, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Yingkou, Liaoning, An various sub regions. In the past, the ships operating on various routes included the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the private Zhengji, Northern, Zhidong, Zhaoxing, Datongxing, Yu Da companies, and foreign ships included the British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies. However, after the war, Chinese ships were subsequently forced to suspend operations, and British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships were repeatedly obstructed, and could only barely maintain the Shanghai-Qingdao-Yantai-Tianjin routes. Now, due to the European War, they have announced the suspension of operations. As for Japanese merchants, under the cooperation of the Japanese naval authorities, they have greatly expanded. In addition to Japanese shipping companies such as Nisshin, Dalian, Yamashita, Osaka, Near Seas, and International, who are trying their best to dominate North China's shipping, they have also acquired all the ships of the Zhengji company and leased various Chinese merchant ships, specializing in North China's shipping routes, so that the North China shipping routes have become the world of Japanese merchants.

The Nanyang shipping routes are divided into: Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Wenzhou, Shanghai-Fuzhou, Shanghai-Xiamen, Shanghai-Shantou, Shanghai-Hong Kong, Shanghai-Guangzhou regions, as well as Inner Harbor Shanghai-Taiwan, Shanghai-Ruiping, Shanghai-Xingquan and Ningbo, Dinghai, Xiangshan, Taizhou, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Macau, Wuzhou various sub regions. Among them, except for the Inner Harbor routes operated by Chinese merchants, the Shanghai-Fuzhou, Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou routes have always been operated by British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships. However, later, the Japanese warships, on the pretext of military operations, attempted to blockade Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xinghua, Sandu Ao, Shacheng and other ports, and arbitrarily detained and inspected foreign ships along the coast, obstructing navigation, so that ships of various countries operating on these routes lost their freedom of navigation and their business declined sharply. Therefore, at present, it is the day when shipping industries of various countries with more than 80 years of history in China have encountered misfortune.

### Past Week

In the past week, the phenomenon of rising prices for all goods has at least stopped; in the speculative market, there has generally been a state of decline in all goods. Comparing the market prices of last Saturday with those of the Saturday before: cash small six (a type of coin) was 60 yuan; twenty strands of Double Horse (a brand of yarn) spot goods were a little under 22 yuan; Tongzhou flower (a type of cotton) was a little under 11 yuan; the prices of various grades of rice were generally a little under 6 or 7 yuan to 12 or 13 yuan, varying. At this time, foreign exchange rates were steadily increasing, and the weakness at the weekend was only the result of struggles by major players. The results of the struggles were only this much, showing that the power of the bulls will always lose out to the improvement of objective circumstances! What are the improved objective circumstances? One is that the great victory in Changsha has strengthened the confidence of the Chinese people in final victory; the other is that the not-quite-dead, not-quite-alive war situation in Europe has greatly activated China's export industry. Therefore, the way to have a good life is not difficult, and the direction everyone should strive for is nothing more than this. (Editor)

If you want to "gain both fame and fortune," the opportunity is waiting for you at the small window of the post office. According to reports, more than 1,000 post offices across the country will be selling "National Construction Savings Bonds" starting from the end of November. Use your savings to buy these savings bonds, helping "national construction" now, and in the future, you will not only get back your principal but also earn interest income; wouldn't that be "gaining both fame and fortune" in one fell swoop? (Wang Siwei)

The wave of resignations of all internal and external officials in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, due to Abe's yielding to his subordinates, seems to have come to an end. If there are no other obstacles in the future, the Ministry of Trade will probably be able to open on an auspicious day. The purpose of establishing this ministry is nothing more than to use trade to assist diplomatic negotiations, and at the same time, attempt to achieve the desire to revitalize exports. However, it only has the export power of peaceful commodities, which is definitely not welcomed by various countries; the military supplies that various countries welcome to import are exactly what Japan cannot spare the effort to export. Therefore, it cannot exert any power in diplomacy with this, and even the hope of revitalizing exports is very small. Moreover, the prerequisite for revitalizing exports is to have sufficient raw materials. It only has one way, which is to take it from China. If it hadn't suffered a major defeat in northern Hunan, the tricks of "cooperation" and "control" in the occupied areas might have been very lively already. (Zhengze)

The reporter accurately predicted in the last issue of this publication that Vice Admiral of Shipbuilding Takao Utaro would not be able to stay in the position of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and would sooner or later hand it over to someone else. Unexpectedly, yesterday's Tokyo telegram already had news of Utaro's resignation. Abe's ideal of a centralized system has therefore been discounted again. I can't help but feel disheartened for Abe.

### The First Half of the Year for China's Banking Industry

— Yang Zheng

Changes in the establishment of banks: In the past six months, only two new banks have been established, the Xingwen Bank in Kunming and the Gansu Bank in Lanzhou. The former was reorganized from the Xingwen Official Bank and was established on May 1, with a capital of 600,000 New Yunnan currency funded by the Yunnan Provincial Department of Finance. According to the history of the Official Bank, it was initially named Xingwen and was established during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, operating two types of businesses: remittance and pawnbroking. After the Republic of China, it underwent several reforms. After the Department of Finance joined the government shares, it was changed to the Official Bank, with a total capital of 3 million Yunnan New currency. The scope of business was expanded compared to before, in addition to deposit, trust, and pawn businesses, it also acted as the treasury of the Department of Finance, funding for education, and military and political funds. The latter was reorganized from the Gansu Provincial Ping City Official Money Bureau under the order of the Ministry of Finance and opened on June 1.

The bank that closed down in the past six months was the Beiyang Baoshang Bank in Peiping, which announced liquidation on January 5. According to records, the bank was initiated by the Minister of Beiyang in the 34th year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty and was not established until the 2nd year of Xuantong. The initial authorized capital was 4 million taels, which was later changed to a limited company with a paid-up capital of 1,129,500 yuan. The head office was located in Peiping, and a branch was located in Tianjin. It issued banknotes, which amounted to 3 million yuan by the end of last year.

Mergers and additions: In the past six months, a total of six branches of banks have been merged, including four branches and two offices. In terms of region, five were in Shanghai and only one was in Yichang.

In the past six months, the establishment of branches of banks has mostly been in the southwestern provinces. This is a manifestation of the shift of China's financial center to the southwestern provinces; a list of branch additions in the past six months is as follows: Month Bank Name Region January

Business trends: The business trends of banks in the past six months have been carried out in accordance with China's wartime financial policy. For example, the central and special banks, in view of the importance of finance in the rear, through the resolution of the joint headquarters of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, laid out a financial network in the southwest and northwest provinces, which was carried out in four phases and was to be completed within this year. The four-bank discount committee has provided financial assistance to local industries, the salt industry, the metal industry, the electrical materials industry, the shipbuilding industry, and various manufacturers in various places, all of which are directly or indirectly related to military affairs. Furthermore, due to the bombing of various cities and the evacuation of the population, funds have been allocated to build houses in nearby villages, with an estimated cost of 10 million yuan. It is actively assisting the government in providing reconstruction loans after the bombing of various cities. In addition, the Ministry of Finance stipulates that the Bank of China handles remittances from overseas Chinese. The business trends of provincial and municipal banks, after the second local financial conference in March, resolved the following six items: (1) Develop economic strength (1) Maintain currency system credit, (3) Increase business, (4) Purchase materials, (5) Balance prices, (6) Meet the needs of food. The essence contained in each item is closely related to people's livelihood, national economy, and the foundation for economic revival. Provincial and municipal banks have been able to proceed in accordance with the resolutions, and there have been significant achievements.

### Grain: New japonica rice soaked in water, sold at a discount

The market price plummeted by 13 yuan.

Arrivals from various roads are also surging.

The rice market yesterday was deserted due to heavy rain. Yesterday, locals came to the market to buy, and there were quite a few additions, so sales felt brisk. However, the sources from various roads were also strong. Two or three boats arrived from the river, and 5,000 to 6,000 bags were transported by wheel. Moreover, a considerable number were soaked by rain on the way. Merchants were afraid of changes in the quality of the rice and intended to sell quickly, making it difficult for the market to see improvement. If the broken japonica, new japonica, kiln seeds, Bage (types of rice), and Lu Yangjian (another type of rice), except for water-soaked goods, the market price still sticks to the original price. Changxi broken rice is calculated at 30 yuan, and decisively 27 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Sichuan pickled mustard tuber is in short supply and prices rise

Sichuan pickled mustard tuber, recently, there have been no subsequent arrivals, and the market inventory is dwindling. There are only a few hundred remaining, so although the sales season has passed, the selling price has instead increased. Yesterday, Fuling mustard tuber arrived at 82 yuan. According to a message from Hankou, the inventory is also short, and the purchase price has risen by 5 or 6 yuan.

### Coal: Hongji coal transactions are sluggish

Hongji white coal, since a large batch arrived the previous week, the price has fallen by 10 yuan from 126 yuan, causing people's hearts to be shaken and watching. At this time when the water transport season has not yet arrived, most people take goods according to the market and dare not seek greed. Therefore, transactions among colleagues have become sluggish, and the daily turnover is less than 100 tons, but the door shop still sells at the original price, because most of the street customers have stocked goods, the cost is higher, and they are unwilling to sell lightly. Screened blocks are 17 yuan per basket (100 city catties per load) and 6.8 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: The United States uses more real silk

The statistics of raw silk in New York show that imports and sales in September increased compared with the previous month. It is because the season has entered late autumn, and winter silk fabrics have been put on machines, and raw materials are mostly made of real silk. On the other hand, it is said that artificial silk factories have been affected by the European war, which has also made the sales of real silk smoother. According to the statistics, New York's raw silk imports in September were 39,569 loads, an increase of 7,162 loads, sales were 36,869 loads, an increase of 3,774 loads, and the bottom stock increased by 2,700 loads, but compared with the bottom stock in September of the previous year, it has decreased by a huge 12,951 loads. The statistics are specially transcribed for the reference of the silk industry.

### Broadcloth and overcoating wool are selling well

Recently, broadcloth and overcoating materials such as cavalry twill, Tussah, Crombie, chocolate, plain black and gray tweed, herringbone corduroy, etc., have been selling even more vigorously, and each yard has risen sharply by 1 or 2 yuan. Searching around Daxin Street is even more diligent. At this moment, British-made 1005 cavalry twill is all priced at 18 yuan, Kongshi brand is increased by 5 jiao, Crombie Tussah is 17.5 yuan, non-Western goods Yuanchang Tussah corduroy first-class is 11.5 yuan, second-class is 9.5 yuan, Zhanghua Yihua cavalry twill is all shouting 10.05 yuan, Yihua Tussah is 14 yuan, Yongxing is 11 yuan.

Sex Hygiene

### Hygiene of primary sexual characteristics and reproductive function

— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School

Regarding the differences between the sexes, on the surface, it seems very obvious and easy, but in fact, it is sometimes vague and difficult to distinguish. There are several kinds of animals whose sexual characteristics are only obvious during the mating season. Some birds and reptiles can only be determined by people with considerable knowledge and experience as female or male, which is impossible for ordinary people. Even in humans, sometimes the distinction between men and women is also difficult to determine, and it must be checked by experts or specialized doctors for a long time before a clear distinction can be made, because humans are also similar to animals, and there are people with both male and female characteristics (commonly known as hermaphrodites), but the quantity is less than that of animals. Usually, what is seen is mostly similar hermaphrodites, only their appearance has the characteristics of both male and female sexes; if they really have both sexes' reproduction, then they can be called true hermaphrodites, but the number is very small. Therefore, it is not enough to distinguish men and women by appearance alone. It is necessary to see whether there are ovaries or testicles to be the standard of distinction. If a person has testicles in his body, then this person is male, and similarly, a person has ovaries in his body, then this person is female. Therefore, the primary sexual characteristics are distinguished by the testicles and ovaries that are directly related to reproduction.

Generally, people have testicles or ovaries at birth, so the primary sexual characteristics are innate. The hygiene of both sexes' reproduction is closely related to the prosperity of mankind, so it is described separately as follows:

The hygiene of reproduction, in a word, is desire. Before marriage, it is best to remain chaste, have a clear mind and few desires, do not defile yourself and cause injury, so that the metabolism of the old and new declines, premature aging and kidney deficiency, the brain and kidney lose the guarantee of prosperity, and all kinds of diseases arise, such as spermatorrhea, neurasthenia, back pain, gradually forming. If you don't remedy it early, the consequences are worrying. I, as a doctor, prove that the treatment of this disease can only hope for rejuvenation by actively taking the old German brand testicle essence preparation for men, "Buti Kang". At the same time, it is advisable to avoid mistakenly purchasing similar counterfeit drugs, because although there are preparations with the same ingredients on the market that attract patients, most of them are aphrodisiacs in disguise, or tonics similar to aphrodisiacs. Only Buti Kang is a real male strong animal testicle essence tonic, and it has brain tonic phosphorus added. The female use has the function of regulating menstruation and seeds, treating anemia and premature aging, and the effect is quick.

Amazing Discovery Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Medical Doctor in America

Gonorrhea Spring and Autumn

### There is already a specific medicine for gonorrhea

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Medical Doctor in America

I have been studying gonorrhea for more than ten years. When I was studying in the United States, I paid attention to the radical cure of this disease. I deeply know that gonococcus is a fast-breeding thing, absolutely inferior to general inferior bacteria, so it should be treated quickly, so as not to change, and in treatment, not only take a rapid treatment policy, but also must have solid conditions. Because blindly using powerful drugs to seek quick effects often leads to counterproductive results due to the powerful side effects. Therefore, special attention must be paid to this point.

After two weeks of gonorrhea infection, gonococcus has gonococcus flowing in the blood. Although only the symptoms of gonococcus are seen on the outside, various symptoms often occur. Therefore, it must be treated. According to the experience of scholars from various countries and mine, only increasing white blood cells and immune antitoxin therapy can kill bacteria with the strong force of blood cells, and as a result, gonococcus has nowhere to escape. Only "Kelin Nong" invented by Dr. Peter of Germany can often do this without shame. This agent is made of refined yellow pigment protein. All acute and chronic gonorrhea, plus prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, cystitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, etc., can be taken, and "Kelin Nong" can be used to cure them radically. After taking this agent for the above-mentioned various gonorrhoea, it can produce non-specific anti-gonococcal toxin to attack gonococcus, so all gonococcus can be quickly cured and never recur. As for external medicine, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is the best. Patients can wash the urethra at home according to the diagram and instructions to clear the gonococcus in the urethra. Women can use "Kaerxuedishi vaginal tablets" as suppositories for external use, which will be more effective. Because only this kind of therapy can wipe out gonococcus like the wind sweeps away the residual leaves, which is not comparable to the general transmembrane sterilization therapy. This is why it has long been appreciated by doctors in various countries.

### Tuberculosis Treatment Examples

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Patient Feng Yongde is physically weak. At the age of twenty, he suffered from hemoptysis. He recovered after resting for several months. Later, due to excessive use of his brain, he relapsed last summer, with chest tightness and shortness of breath. Coughing up bloody sputum. He had a slight fever of 37.7 degrees at dusk, and his body became thinner and thinner, haggard and unbearable. He had difficulty falling asleep at night. He had many dreams and palpitations, and he also had night sweats, which caused dizziness and fatigue in the morning. After X-ray examination, there were silver-sized cavities in the lungs, and pulmonary tuberculosis had reached the third stage. He was instructed to take German "Bufei Naer" internally. After taking less than two bottles, the night sweats and fever were gone, and the condition improved greatly. So he continued to take it for three weeks, and at the same time ordered him to be absolutely quiet at home and take more nutrients: cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, etc. were completely cured, and his appetite increased greatly, and his weight increased. He has been transformed into a healthy and beautiful man.

Cured case of spermatorrhea

### Spermatorrhea and Brain Weakness

— Dr. Zheng Ting, Medical Doctor in Germany

Patient Chi Hongbin, a native of Danyang, 21 years old, lives in Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, this city (self-reported) —— I have been weak and sickly since I was a child. I came to Shanghai to work at the age of sixteen. I have no bad habits of masturbation, and I have no bad habits. Since the autumn of eighteen, I have had nocturnal emissions in my dreams every night, but I didn't take it seriously, because I was naive at that time, and I didn't realize the harm of spermatorrhea. On average, I had four nocturnal emissions every month, but on the morning after the nocturnal emissions, I felt mentally exhausted, had headaches and leg pain. At this time, I bought and took a certain malt extract cod liver oil, and it was ineffective after taking three bottles. After half a year, the number of nocturnal emissions gradually increased, and I often had dizziness, weak memory, and suffered from insomnia. Later, I was introduced by a friend to a certain Chinese medicine doctor for diagnosis and treatment. It was said that it was caused by excessive daytime labor. After taking two bottles of pills, it was also ineffective, and the symptoms worsened. I saw the newspaper report and came to seek treatment (cure process) —— I prescribed a large number of "Naires spermatorrhea tablets" to stop his spermatorrhea, and also used "Buti Kang" for men to treat neurasthenia and to replenish his losses. Mr. Chi followed the instructions and after three weeks, there was no spermatorrhea. He also slept peacefully at night. He was ordered to take it for another two months, his spirit was greatly invigorated, his mind was clear, and his weight increased by thirteen pounds. Spermatorrhea has been radically cured since then.

Gonorrhea Lecture

### The Problem of Radical Cure of Recurrent Gonorrhea

— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Gonorrhea is originally a very stubborn disease. If it is not properly treated when it is first contracted, and it becomes chronic, there is no determination to cure it, so the progress of the virus becomes more profound. Although it is lucky to recover for a while, there is often the risk of recurrence, because gonorrhea patients have very strong resistance when they are healthy - part of their resistance is caused by the occurrence of gonorrhea. However, if patients encounter other reasons, such as physical weakness, then the gonorrhea, which was regarded as healed, will take the opportunity to rise up and wreak havoc on people. The patient's pain at that time must be worse than before, and the changes in the disease are also more difficult to predict than before, because gonococcus has been suppressed for a long time. Although the appearance is safe and sound, its internal situation is because the gonococcus breeds and lurks, so once it is launched, it is like a flood, and it is difficult to contain it. Although the above is said, it is only that gonorrhea patients can temporarily recover because of their health and ability to follow health methods. What's more, because of the use of powerful drugs or clumsy surgery, they are temporarily subdued and then recur, which is even more severe than before. In short, if there are no symptoms of gonorrhea on the surface, but there is still gonococcus lurking in the body, it can never be regarded as a radical cure. In recent years, I have been confident in the treatment of this kind of recurrent gonorrhea. First, use serum testing to prove that there is gonorrhea toxin lurking, and then use German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy alternately, while taking the gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelin Nong" internally, so that its bactericidal effect will wash the whole body, then any gonococcus can never escape, so it can be completely and fundamentally solved. Therefore, once cured, there will be no recurrence. This is truly worthy of the gonorrhea method that fundamentally solves gonorrhea. Diagnosis time: 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. 20 numbers are sent for diagnosis every day, and only 5 jiao is charged for each number, and a "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth 1 yuan is given as a gift.

### The Shanghai Consular Corps Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss Problems in Western Shanghai, and Decide on a Negotiation Policy After the British and American Attitudes Are Firm and Will Never Concede

Regarding the negotiations on the construction of roads beyond the boundary, Mr. Phillips, Director-General of the Public Works Department, exchanged views with the pseudo "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan twice in June and early September of this year, hoping to find a solution. However, the pseudo-party's actions have become more and more intensified, having already infringed on police power and attempted to seize taxes worth more than one million yuan per year. The Japanese-proposed plan to adjust the defense area also requires the withdrawal of British defense forces from the road construction area beyond the boundary. Recently, after thorough discussions by the parties concerned, they have all adopted a firm attitude, believing that except for negotiations with the Chinese government that are related to territorial sovereignty, other methods seem to be unable to obtain a thorough solution. Therefore, it is quite advocated to temporarily put aside the negotiations on road construction beyond the boundary and the defense area issue. The United Kingdom and the United States have significant rights and interests in its public concessions and will never easily concede. Although the United Kingdom is currently having affairs in Europe, the United States cannot ignore it. Yesterday, a reporter from the Dachung News Agency obtained another reliable news in diplomatic circles, hearing that the Consular Corps has decided to convene a meeting within this week, at most five days, to discuss the issue of road construction beyond the boundary in western Shanghai, to exchange opinions on the report of the authorities and the views of the British and American sides, and to determine the Public Works Department's future negotiation policy with the pseudo-party.

Unarmed pseudo police were blocked twice

The Chinese-Foreign Newspaper (字林報) reports that 160 to 180 unarmed policemen from the "Special Municipal Government," traveling in four trucks, were blocked twice yesterday (the 14th) from entering the British defense area. The matter was peacefully resolved by British Major Ashmore and the Japanese advisor to the "Special Municipal Government," Katie Uka (transliteration), and an official Wang (transliteration) from the "Municipal Government." The four trucks eventually carried the police towards the Hongqiao area. The details are recorded as follows:

Four trucks

Arrived at the railway crossing of Baillinan Road at nearly 5 pm, attempting to enter the Public Concession. However, the British soldiers stationed there immediately blocked the road, and the trucks could not pass and turned to the Daxilu crossing, where they were also blocked by the British soldiers and could not pass. Major Ashmore

Reported immediately

Arrived at the scene a few minutes later. Around 7 pm, the Japanese advisor and Mr. Wang also arrived. Major Ashmore explained to the two that those who passed in groups would not be allowed to pass without the permission of the British military authorities. It is heard that Major Ashmore also told the two that it had been repeatedly explained that those who intended to cross the border in groups must obtain permission. The nature of the conversation at the time was extremely friendly. The Japanese advisor then ordered the trucks to return to the defense area. The general public does not pay much attention to this matter.

### Salvation Army Major to Work in Chongqing

Traveling with Chinese staff to serve in the Southwest

The Continental Daily (大陸報) reported yesterday (the 14th) that the Salvation Army Headquarters announced that Major Baglai of the Army and four trained Chinese staff will depart for Chongqing on Tuesday. The work of the Salvation Army will be expanded to southwestern China. Major Bei has been the second in command of the Salvation Army in the Shanghai area for the past two years, proving that his previous experience in social work in India and North China has special value. Major Bei took office as an officer in 1919 and was sent to China in 1921. For the past 18 years, he has held a very responsible position in this charity and has traveled all over China. This decision was made in response to the call of friends who said that Chongqing urgently needs the services of the Salvation Army, and he is currently establishing a new agency in Chongqing.

### Stalled Settlement of Local Goods Exchange, Shortened Shanghai-Ningbo Voyage Schedule

The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route is currently stalled due to the requirement for foreign exchange settlement for Ningbo's exported local products. Although various industries in Shanghai and Ningbo have sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance requesting flexibility, the export of local Ningbo goods to Shanghai remains suspended until instructions are received. However, as ships are only carrying passengers, round trips are shorter. It is reported that the Far East Company's "Hana Maru" departed for Zhenhai yesterday, and Jardine Matheson & Co.'s "Mowatt" is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Zhenhai on the 17th, carrying only passengers, with cargo loading temporarily suspended.

### U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Departs Shanghai for the Philippines This Morning; U.S. Consul General Gauss Feted Him Last Night, with Admiral Hepburn Also in Attendance

The newly appointed U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, arrived in Shanghai at 2:45 p.m. yesterday aboard the Dollar Steamship Lines' "President Cleveland." Various American organizations in Shanghai and U.S. Consul General Gauss, among others, went to the Jianghai Customs pier to welcome him. At 6 p.m. yesterday, the U.S. Consul General hosted a banquet at Xiejiao, Jing'an Temple Road.

Admiral Hepburn,

Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, was also in attendance. The atmosphere was very cordial. Gauss delivered a welcome speech, and Sayre gave a brief thank-you speech. Sayre is scheduled to take office on the 19th and did not want to stay in Shanghai any longer. He departed Shanghai this morning on the same ship for Hong Kong and the Philippines to assume his post.

The previous

High Commissioner

to the Philippines, Mr. McNutt, returned to Washington this spring. The Washington government then internally decided that Sayre would succeed him. Also arriving in Shanghai on the "President Cleveland" was

Mr. Douglas,

who will take up the post of Captain of the Yangtze River Fleet. Mr. Douglas recently completed a trip to his native Finland. He went to the United States after the outbreak of the European War. During his short stay in the U.S., he once gave a radio address to America about the world war. He then took the "President Cleveland" from San Francisco to Shanghai.

According to Western Newspapers

The Shanghai Times reported that the American community in Shanghai eagerly welcomed Mr. and Mrs. Sayre, the newly appointed U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, and their staff, who arrived aboard the "President Cleveland" scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 1:45 p.m. today (the 15th), and will depart on the same ship

for Manila

to take up their new posts tomorrow morning (the 16th) at 10:00 a.m. It is expected that after the "President Cleveland" docks, Mr. and Mrs. Sayre will disembark on Admiral Hepburn's private yacht. According to the plan, Admiral Hepburn, U.S. Consul General Gauss, and several members of the American community will board the "President Cleveland" on a U.S. Navy motorboat to meet Mr. Sayre. Gauss stated that due to the limited time the ship is docked in Shanghai, the American community will not hold a

formal reception.

However, from 5 to 6 p.m. today, a banquet will be held at the Columbia Country Club to give the American community an opportunity to meet Mr. and Mrs. Sayre. It is noted that U.S. President Roosevelt appointed Sayre as the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines on July 27, succeeding McNutt.

### Transportation Bank's Withdrawn Branches Resume Business Today; Payments Made Through Rear Door, Employee Examinations to Continue

After the former site of the head office of the Bank of Communications at 10 Hankou Road was forcibly requisitioned by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, the branches that had withdrawn are waiting for a reasonable resolution from the concession authorities. The withdrawn branches are scheduled to resume business at their original locations this morning. All documents from the tutoring classes have been moved out, and the employee recruitment examinations will continue after a suitable location is found. The details are as follows:

Resuming Operations at the Original Location Today

The temporary liaison offices of the Bank of Communications' Zhejiang Area, Shanghai Area, and Zhenjiang Area branches, which were forced to temporarily cease operations on the 13th, have not only telegraphed the head office for instructions but have also convened a meeting of the withdrawn branches by the Shanghai branch. It has been decided to resume payments at the original locations starting today (Monday). Those who wish to withdraw funds from the various withdrawn branches should enter and exit through the rear door of the bank on Hankou Road. At the same time, employees of the withdrawn branches have been sorting everything out since the morning before yesterday. The doormen and patrolmen hired by the bank have also resumed their duties.

Documents and Examination Questions Moved Out Yesterday

Since the Japanese Military Police Headquarters forcibly requisitioned the third and fourth floors of the building, the concession authorities are responsible for negotiations. The Shanghai Municipal Council is submitting this matter to the board of directors for discussion, but no decision has yet been made. However, the Bank of Communications is waiting for a legal resolution from the concession authorities. As for the tutoring class's documents, equipment, and examination questions used for the recruitment examination, they were completely moved out yesterday. Therefore, the bank will continue to conduct the examinations after a suitable location is found. However, the employee tutoring class has been forced to temporarily suspend classes due to the occupation of its location.

Employee Examinations to Continue

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited the bank on the Bund of Hankou Road yesterday. The reporter noted that the rooms requisitioned by the Japanese soldiers are the entire third and fourth floors, while the ground floor and second floor are used for the offices of the withdrawn branches. The third and fourth floors are separated from the ground floor and second floor, and the Japanese soldiers enter and exit through the main entrance at 10 Hankou Road. Therefore, the operations of the withdrawn branches are not affected in any way. Furthermore, the reporter met with a deputy manager of the bank yesterday, who confirmed that the withdrawn branches are scheduled to resume business at the original location today, and the documents of the tutoring class have indeed been moved out as stated. The recruitment examination will continue after a suitable location is found.

British Troops Visited for Inspection

The location of the Bank of Communications is purely within the defense zone of British troops. The Japanese side's sudden action not only undermines the concession's police authority but also directly threatens the British troops. The British military authorities in Shanghai, upon learning of this news, dispatched a small team of over thirty Central British soldiers, fully armed, to inspect the Hankou Road area yesterday morning around 9:00 a.m. They withdrew around 10:00 a.m. It is reported that after the British troops inspected, they will report the information to the highest British military authority in China for instructions on how to respond accordingly.

Western Newspaper Reports Rental Nature

The Continental Daily News reported yesterday (the 14th) that twenty Japanese in plain clothes forcibly occupied the third and fourth floors of the former Bank of Communications building on the Bund of Hankou Road on Friday morning. At that time, the Shanghai Municipal Police planned to ask the British troops patrolling the area for assistance in expelling the invading Japanese. It was later learned that in the past few days, a Japanese person had visited the building with a bank employee. The police were unaware of any relationship between the bank and the Japanese side, so they had to postpone taking action pending further developments. The North-China Daily News reported yesterday that the Japanese side had proposed renting a portion of the building to use as a dormitory, paying a monthly rent of several thousand yuan, said to be three thousand yuan, at least according to what the employees knew.

### Unabated Street Flooding, High Tide Persists for Three More Days, Low-Lying Areas Still Ankle-Deep Last Night, Central District Particularly High and Relatively Dry

The high tide in the Huangpu River that began on the 13th will continue until the 20th before it subsides. During the high tide, water inevitably overflows from the low-lying roads and sewers. The tide times and levels for today (the 16th) to the 19th are recorded below: On the 16th, the high tide at 1:44 a.m. was 10 feet, 7.5 inches; the high tide at 2:10 p.m. was 11 feet, 2.8 inches; on the 17th, the high tide at 2:20 a.m. was 9 feet, 5.3 inches; the high tide at 5:52 p.m. was 10 feet, 8.2 inches; on the 18th, the high tide at 2:55 a.m. was 8 feet, 9.2 inches; the high tide at 3:40 p.m. was 10 feet, 0.5 inches.

Street Flooding Has Not Yet Subsided

After the heavy rain yesterday morning in the city, the high tide in the Huangpu River continued yesterday afternoon, causing the street flooding to recede very slowly and not yet completely subside. According to surveys, areas such as the intersection of Qihaiwei Road and Ma Huo Road, Alabastine Road, Gansu Road, Jiaozhou Road, Saposai Road, north of Avenue Albert and Avenue Joffre, Route Cardinal Mercier, mid-section of Route Paul Henry, Rue Massenet, Avenue Foch, and Route Haig are still flooded.

High Tide Continued Yesterday Afternoon

According to the predictions of the

Harbour Bureau, the Huangpu River continued to experience a high tide at 1:35 p.m. yesterday, with a level of 11 feet. Therefore, water overflowed from the street sewers again, and low-lying roads were once again flooded. Regarding transportation, everything had returned to normal yesterday, but public buses, such as those on route 22 in the French Concession, still had to detour via Avenue Foch and still had to wade through water until late at night. The sky was overcast all day yesterday, and the weather was not yet formally [clear].

### Eyewitness Account of Chinese Air Force Attack on Hankou

36 Japanese Planes Completely Destroyed, Pilots Also Killed in the Planes

Chinese Cheer and Applaud

The Japanese ship "Hoyo Maru" arrived in Shanghai from Hankou the day before yesterday. According to a Chinese passenger who took the return trip to Shanghai, at approximately 1:00 p.m. on the 3rd of this month, just as the "Hoyo Maru" arrived in Hankou from Shanghai and was about to dock, the brave Chinese Air Force

appeared over Hankou.

According to the eyewitness, there were six large bombers flying at a low altitude, with over thirty fighter planes guarding and covering them at a high altitude. The bombers then fiercely dropped bombs amidst the Japanese anti-aircraft fire, with the bombs

raining down like trash.

The explosions were deafening. There were thirty-six Japanese planes at the airfield, with pilots already in the cockpits, preparing to take off to intercept. Due to the lack of time, the planes were completely destroyed and burned, and over thirty pilots

were killed in the planes.

The burning lasted for over an hour. When the Chinese planes were bombing, no Japanese planes were seen taking off to resist. However, the Chinese gathered in the French Concession cheered and applauded. The Japanese military police stood outside the concession, helpless.

### Railway Traffic Conditions from Rangoon to Lashio; Yunnan-Burma Road Temporarily Open to Baoshan, Connection to Burmese Railway Awaits

Since our country's Yunnan-Burma Road began military traffic, British Burma has become an important gateway for the import and export of materials in the southwest. Currently, the Yunnan-Burma Road can only reach Baoshan. The direct connection to the Burmese railway from Lashio to Rangoon, for direct intermodal transport, is still pending. However, the importance of this road is not diminished by the fact that it has not yet been connected. The current status of railway traffic between Rangoon and Lashio is described in detail as follows: The Rangoon to Lashio railway is 903 kilometers long, with a travel time of 28 hours. Freight express can arrive in three days. From Rangoon to Toungoo (267 kilometers), it is double-tracked. From Toungoo to Mandalay (53 kilometers), Mandalay to Hsipaw (199 kilometers), and Hsipaw to Lashio (84 kilometers), all are single-tracked. The main passenger train on the Rangoon to Mandalay line has a mixed train running daily in both directions. It arrives in Lashio at night and departs from Lashio in the morning. The first, second, and third class carriages are available, but there are no fourth-class seats. In addition to the stations, ticket sales points are set up in many downtown areas of major cities to sell tickets for each section and accept parcels. Rangoon and other stations also have railway reception centers, which are exclusively for first-class passengers to rest. The room rates are relatively high, and the maximum stay is no more than five days. As for the dining rooms along the route, although many are set up, they are only for first and second-class passengers to eat. The prices are fixed, and meal tickets must be purchased in advance.

### Exemption from Exchange Settlement for Zhejiang Province Native Paper Requested

Since the promulgation of the Measures for Exchange Settlement and Collection of Exchange Rate Differences for Export Goods, trade associations in Shanghai have called for relief. As a result, goods transported from Zhejiang, Fujian, and other places to Shanghai have been forced to be blocked at ports such as Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, after receiving requests from various trade associations, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs requesting swift relief to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. It again telegraphed the ministries yesterday, stating that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing are aware that the Zhejiang Customs has refused to allow the export of native paper because it has not settled foreign exchange, and the source of supply is about to be cut off. Native goods are made by hand using local raw materials, and sales are already minimal. Now, they are also required to settle foreign exchange, which will not only cause foreign paper to be dumped, but also harm the collectors, transporters, and local farmers. The public sentiment is urgent, and it is requested that relief be granted immediately. It is appropriate to telegraph the ministries to request that they consult the Zhejiang Provincial Government and order the Zhejiang Customs to exempt native paper from exchange settlement and allow its transport. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully.

### Exchange of Small Denomination Notes Restricted Due to Crowding; Large Quantities of Small Denomination Notes Recently Shipped from Hong Kong; United Association of Special District Urges Recall of Tokens

The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank has already limited the exchange of subsidiary coins to 20 yuan per business. The issuance of 10-cent and 20-cent subsidiary notes has not been restricted in terms of the amount of exchange. However, due to the crowding of those applying for exchange, the number of notes exchanged exceeds the previous number. Deeply fearing that large sums will flow into the occupied areas, the bank will, from today, also impose appropriate restrictions on large-scale exchanges. It is also heard that a large number of subsidiary notes have recently been shipped from Hong Kong, all printed by the China Book Company. Furthermore, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association is extremely concerned about the difficulty of the shortage of small denomination coins in the city. Because the streetcar company, the bus company, and various industry coupons have not been recalled immediately after the Central Bank issued subsidiary coins, the circulation of subsidiary coins has been hindered.

### Proposed Amicable Settlement After the Collapse of the Tonghe Bank; The Process Was Conducted at the Bankers' Association Yesterday; Settlement Would Be Discussed After Auditors Such as Dong Yu and Others Checked the Accounts

The Tonghe Commercial Savings Bank in the city collapsed over a year ago, owing depositors hundreds of thousands of yuan. The bank authorities applied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for an amicable settlement in accordance with the bankruptcy law. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has twice convened meetings of debtors and creditors to discuss settlement methods, but no resolution has yet been reached. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has drafted a settlement plan for the incident: (1) 50% of savings deposits will be repaid, and the remaining 50% will be issued as shares of the bank. Directors and supervisors will advance 10% of the cash first, and receipts for 50% of the stock funds will be issued at the same time. It will be deposited with the Central Bank to guarantee that when it is ready to be collected, another 40% will be issued immediately; (2) It is estimated that 50% of commercial deposits can be repaid. The remaining 50% will be issued as shares of the bank when it is restored to business after the amicable settlement. There are three methods: First, it is estimated that one-third of the three million yuan in mortgage loans of the bank, or one million yuan, can be recovered; second, it is estimated that two-tenths of the 780,000 yuan in credit loans and 50,000 yuan in collection receivables, or more than 160,000 yuan, have a chance of being recovered. If the restoration of business and the amicable settlement are successful, the commercial depositors will first withdraw 100,000 yuan from the bank's fundraising to repay 10% of the deposits. Afterwards, the called-in amounts shall be repaid in batches. The remainder will be issued as shares of the bank when it is restored to business. The creditors of the savings department have accepted the settlement plan, but the creditors of the commercial department are still unanimously opposed. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of debtors and creditors at the Bankers' Association yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. to conduct the amicable settlement. 70 creditor representatives attended, representing a claim amount of more than 500,000, which was legally insufficient. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce representatives Pei Yunqing and Xi Yushu announced that the meeting would be changed to a discussion meeting. Then, representatives of both the debtor and creditor parties spoke in succession. The creditor Wang Licai first thought that he was a representative to check the accounts. After Dong Yu and other lawyers described the process of recommending representatives to check the accounts, Wang was speechless. Finally, Xi Yushu concluded that after Wang Licai, Wang Hongji, and Dong Yu and other representatives checked the accounts, they would talk again. The meeting then adjourned.

### Soviet Union Withdraws Consulates; Japan Has Not Received Explanation; Believes This Move Has Some Significance But Has Not Received Formal Explanation From Soviet Side

The Continental Daily News reported that when the spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy greeted the press yesterday (the 13th), he claimed that the Japanese authorities had not received a formal explanation regarding the transfer of the Soviet consulates in the Japanese-occupied areas of China to the Norwegian consulates. For this move by the Soviet side, various reasons can be "inferred," but even if any of the reasons are correct, he should not disclose them. Eleven Soviet consulate officials have been recalled, leaving two or three people to take care of the consulate buildings. Due to the position of these two or three people, they cannot handle consulate affairs. If the spokesperson was asked whether he believed that the recall of Soviet consulate officials was purely a local matter or had a wider significance, the spokesperson replied that the public had expressed various opinions on this measure by the Soviet side, but this matter certainly had some significance. The Japanese side has not received a formal explanation from the Soviet side. The spokesperson also admitted that he did not know that several Soviet consulates in the Japanese-controlled areas had been transferred to the care of the Norwegian diplomatic authorities.

### The Adventures of the Two German Ships; Avoiding Interception by British Warships, Enduring Hardships, Passengers Left Their Fate to Heaven and Were Glad to Be Alive

The North German Lloyd's "Scharhörn" and "Cremon" passenger ships were well-known to the people here. At the beginning of the European War, the two ships happened to be sailing in the waters of the East, and their whereabouts suddenly became mysterious. All circles were also very concerned. It was later learned that the two ships detoured to avoid interception by British warships and escaped to the coast of Japan to dock, and they were gradually

faded from memory.

A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency met a Westerner in Shanghai yesterday who had arrived from Japan. According to him, his relatives and friends who were passengers on the "Scharhörn" and "Cremon" personally experienced the dangerous situation. The frightening story is as follows: The "Cremon" left Singapore on August 25 with passengers bound for Manila. That evening, all passengers were summoned to the deck. The captain arrived shortly and delivered a speech. He first said that the ship had been requisitioned by the German Navy, so it was no longer the "Cremon."

Female passengers

Hearing the news, they burst into tears. The captain continued, saying that the ship would no longer sail to Manila, but would go to an unknown location. At this point, the passengers could only console themselves by leaving their fate to heaven. From then on, the "Cremon" sailed in the Pacific Ocean, meandering around. The smokestacks and ship name were painted over. After sailing for more than 20 days, it finally arrived at

Kobe, Japan

and docked. The passengers' adventurous journey came to an end. Normally, the ship would take only five days to sail from Singapore to Manila, but this time the passengers spent more than twenty days and were sent to Kobe, which they did not want to go to. They had to buy another boat to go to the Philippines. The visitor then mentioned the "Scharhörn", saying that on the

eve of the outbreak of the war,

it happened to be leaving the port of Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. The captain received a radio order to rush to Japan and warned that there were two British warships waiting outside the waters of Batavia, preparing to capture the ship. Therefore, it sailed at super speed, rushing to Kobe. It was not discovered by British warships along the way. However, the ship's speed exceeded its capabilities, and the passengers were uneasy. Fortunately, it was spared an accident and arrived safely at the port. Only then could they sleep peacefully.

### Commercial Registration Approved in Shanghai

The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently approved the temporary registration of commercial enterprises in the city, including Yihua Industrial Cooperative, Binsheng Silver Shop, Continental Screw Factory, China Button Factory, and twelve others. Their business scope, capital amount, name and address of the principal or partners, and the number of registration notices have all been published in the Commercial Monthly, Volume 19, Number 9, in accordance with the Ministry's order.

### Increased Mooring Fees for Ships Berthing at Buoys; Fees Doubled Starting from the 26th, Calculated per 24 Hours

Starting from the 26th of this month, the Jianghai Customs will increase the mooring fees for ships berthing at buoys in various sections of the Huangpu River. The details are described as follows:

Measures for Collecting Fees for Ship Berthing

The buoys set up by the Inland Customs in various sections of the Huangpu River are for the needs of various ships berthing. The mooring fees are based on the length of the ship. Longer ships must occupy two buoys at both ends (i.e., Type A), and smaller ships only need one buoy (i.e., Type C). Regarding the ship's berthing time, it is calculated per 24 hours. If it is less than 24 hours, the fee is still charged for one day.

Types A and C Doubled

Currently, the mooring fee is 30 yuan in national currency per 24 hours for Type A and 15 yuan for Type C. According to news from the Jianghai Customs yesterday, the Customs Harbour Affairs Department said that the cost of labor and metal products has increased significantly, resulting in a sharp increase in the cost of repairing buoys, cables, and machinery. The original fee is not enough to compensate. Therefore, it has been decided to double the original fee starting from the 26th of this month, that is, 60 yuan for Type A, which was originally 30 yuan, and 30 yuan for Type C, which was originally 15 yuan.

### Train Derailment in Linping, Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Casualties; Japanese Train Hits Landmine and Explodes, More Than 300 Officers and Soldiers All Annihilated

Jinhua, 15th telegram. The Chinese army in western Zhejiang buried landmines near Xitang Village, between Linping and Chang'an on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road on the evening of the 6th. A Japanese train with four attached flower cars left Hangzhou North. It hit a mine and exploded when it arrived there on the morning of the 7th. The train head was torn to shreds, and the train cars immediately overturned. More than 100 meters of railway track and 60 to 70 meters of roadbed were also destroyed. The Chinese ambushing troops took the opportunity to attack fiercely, throwing hand grenades into the train cars, killing nearly 100 senior Japanese military officers, including Kondo Yoshiyuki and Masuda Kiyoshi, and more than 200 soldiers and military police escorting the train, all of whom were annihilated. The Chinese army seized a large number of weapons, ammunition, and documents. Later, the escorting train rushed to the scene, and the Chinese army safely transferred.

Japanese Increase Defense of Bridges on Shanghai-Hangzhou Road

Due to the active mobile units of the Chinese army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line, the Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places specially dispatched Japanese and puppet troops from Shanghai by truck to reinforce the defenses along the railway yesterday morning. In addition to reinforcing the defenses at each bridge along the railway, a reconnaissance plane from Wusong Airport flew low along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line for reconnaissance at around 7:00 a.m. yesterday. In the afternoon, another three Japanese planes flew along the railway and highway for reconnaissance.

Shanghai's Fourth Peace Preservation Army Heavily Suppressed

Gao Fenggui, who was a mid-level officer in the warlord era, organized the puppet "Peace Preservation Army" in the western district of Shanghai and set up agencies all over the suburbs. It was surrounded and suppressed by the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army in the southern and western districts of Shanghai the day before yesterday, suffering heavy losses. It has retreated into the Japanese military cordon.

Heavy Sacrifices in the Battle of Zhabei Port

Hu, the captain of the Zhongdui of Ding Xishan's Pudong Guerrilla Force, recently led his troops to recover the area south of Zhabei Port, completely resolving the puppet army there and executing the puppet "Maintenance Association Chairman" and others, and hoisting the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. However, it was secretly reported by spies, and the Japanese army mobilized more than 300 naval and ground troops on the third day to surround and attack. The Zhongdui captain's troops were only less than 50 people, fighting alone for two hours before breaking through to the south. More than 20 people were gloriously sacrificed, and the Zhongdui captain was also killed in action. The remaining troops retreated to the headquarters to gather. Now, Ding has consulted with his friendly troops, Gu Shouxin, the detachment leader of the old unit of Yu Taosheng, to unite, so he is actively mobilizing troops to launch a major counterattack. Therefore, the Japanese army has opened up two warships in Zhabei Port and the Pudong area, totaling six ships in the Southern Huangpu area in the Xingtang Estuary of Minhang Dujia. In the warships in Zhabei Port, sentry posts are raised every day, and Japanese naval officers observe the movements of the guerrilla areas with binoculars on the top of the building. At night, they are supplemented with searchlights.

Ding and Fan Are Safe, Ding's Mother Was Murdered

The She Wen News Agency reported that there was a rumor in the city a few days ago that Ding Xishan, commander of the 8th Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, and Fan Gencai, the brigade commander, were killed. According to reliable sources, Ding and Fan are both safe. However, Ding Xishan's mother came to Shanghai from her hometown last month, and she was indeed captured and murdered on the way.

### Preferential Treatment for Families of Soldiers on Active Duty; Grain Loans Allowed Exemption From Repayment

To provide preferential treatment to families of soldiers on active duty, the Chinese military authorities have stipulated that families of soldiers on active duty who have borrowed grain from storage are allowed exemption from repayment. An order has already been issued to all provinces to comply.

### Sluggish Sales and Lack of Raw Materials Lead to Many Rubber Factories Shutting Down

Due to sluggish export sales of domestic rubber manufacturing factories in this city after the war, only about a dozen factories were operating. Since the outbreak of the European war, the price of rubber raw materials has soared many times over, and recently, the Malay Peninsula has banned the export of rubber, further exacerbating the difficulties. As a result, up to five-tenths of the factories have voluntarily suspended operations, and the remaining one-fifth have also uniformly reduced working hours to get through this period.

### Shanghai Medical Community Rushes to Rear Hospitals; Giving Up Practices to Serve the Country

After the outbreak of the war, various medical groups in this city actively organized rescue committees, dispatching personnel to the combat zones to rescue wounded soldiers, achieving remarkable results. As the Chinese army moved westward, the battle lines gradually traversed the entire country. These wounded soldiers' hospitals were relocated to the rear in advance to continue providing services. However, there are many newly established hospitals in the rear, and there is a great need for medical talent. The Military Affairs Commission has repeatedly advised doctors in various places to serve the country immediately. Upon hearing the news, many doctors in Shanghai promptly went to the interior to serve. A reporter from Daguan News Agency learned from medical groups that Yan Fuqing, Pang Jingzhou, Zhu Shenbi, and others from the Rescue Committee, after observing rescue work on the front lines, believed that the intense military resistance required a great need for rescue talent. They sent letters to various medical groups in this city, selecting experienced personnel to work in the interior. In recent days, many doctors have voluntarily given up their practices and gone to hospitals in the rear to serve. Their ardent patriotism is truly admirable.

### Orphanage Seeks Winter Clothing and Supplies; Letters Sent to Public Organizations to Promote Donations; Appealing to All Sectors to Actively Donate Items

The Shanghai Refugee Children's Home, established in September of last year, has reached its first anniversary. It initially housed 27 orphans, but the number has gradually increased. The Le Shan Temple site on Xiafei Road was no longer sufficient, so 28 new buildings were constructed in Lane 258, west of Maithesi Road on Wuding Road. These were completed last month, and the orphans were moved into the new buildings. The number of orphans cared for has increased to 507. As the number of orphans has suddenly increased, and in a blink of an eye, autumn is passing and winter is coming, the winter clothing and necessary supplies for the orphans are mostly lacking. It is reported that the orphanage sent letters to various public organizations in this city yesterday to seek support and promote donations. It has also drafted donation standards, appealing to all sectors to actively donate items. The donation standards are as follows: 1. 500 cotton quilts, priced at 6 yuan per quilt (for use as blankets). 2. 250 quilt batting, at 4 yuan per quilt (for use as mattresses). 3. 300 bedsheets, at 2 yuan each. 4. 500 lined uniforms (gray twill fabric, including labor cost 2.5 yuan per set). 5. 500 cotton uniforms (gray twill fabric, including labor cost 5 yuan per set). 6. 500 cotton overcoats (black Shilin fabric, including labor cost 3.5 yuan per coat). 7. 1,000 sets of undershirts and pants (2 yuan per set). 8. 1,000 undershirts (1 yuan each). 9. 100 dozens of towels (1.5 yuan per dozen). 10. 500 toothbrushes. 11. 100 dozens of socks. 12. Generous benefactors who donate the above items or donate money in lieu of items are welcome. Please specify the quantity and send the donation form to the orphanage.

Please call 38133 and ask for the orphanage, and someone will be sent to contact you.

### National Tea Sales Method; Agreed Upon Methods to Be Implemented Jointly

Regarding the issues of national tea procurement and sales, outsiders often do not understand the true situation. Excerpts from the outline of the national tea methods jointly formulated by the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance and the China Tea Company of the Ministry of Economic Affairs are as follows: (1) The China Tea Company handles matters related to tea improvement, production, procurement, transportation, and domestic sales under the supervision of the Trade Commission. (2) All teas that meet the requirements for export, except for those contracted by the China Tea Company and China Trust Bureau this year, will be handled separately. The China Tea Company should, according to the conditions of the Trade Commission, be entrusted by the Trade Commission to purchase all of them and hand them over to the Trade Commission for external barter and external sales. (3) The China Tea Company collects export teas on behalf of the Trade Commission. The main points of the method are as follows: A) All teas suitable for export shall be graded by the Trade Commission together with the provincial governments, tea management offices, provincial tea industry guilds, and the China Tea Company. Each year, outside of tea making, the Trade Commission shall, based on the facts and with reference to the opinions of all parties, announce the prices according to the grades. During the purchase, the grading committee shall be organized by the Trade Commission together with the provincial governments and the China Tea Company to assess the grades and pay according to the announced prices. B) The delivery location of the goods collected by the China Tea Company shall be agreed upon by the Trade Commission and the China Tea Company. The transportation, storage, safekeeping, and insurance costs from the receiving point to the delivery point shall be paid by the Trade Commission based on the facts. C) The Trade Commission shall give the China Tea Company a commission of 3% for the tea purchased, in principle, but it should be stipulated in the formal contract based on the actual expenses of the company and considerable benefits. (Rest omitted).

### A Ship That Had Just Been Repaired Suddenly Sank; Those Arrested Have Not Yet Been Released

The Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochang Temple, Nanshi, was occupied by the Japanese and then taken over and operated by the Japanese company Mitsubishi. It specialized in repairing Japanese warships and ships. In the middle of last month, a Chinese ship salvaged from the Yangtze River was towed to the shipyard by the Japanese. After four months of repairs, it was completed and launched into the water, mooring in the river center. Just as it was about to be tested and put into use, around 11 p.m. on the night of the launching, several holes suddenly appeared in the bottom of the ship, and water poured in. By the time it was discovered, it was impossible to save it. The ship sank to the bottom of the river in less than an hour. The next day, the Japanese army was greatly alarmed, believing that the sabotage was carried out by Chinese patriots disguised as workers in the shipyard. A large-scale investigation was launched, and more than 100 coppersmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters, and workers were arrested and detained, subjected to brutal torture and interrogation. After finding that they were not suspects, several batches were released. Now, a month has passed, and the ship has been salvaged again by the Japanese. It is covered in mud, and all the machinery is destroyed. It will take several months to repair it, and the estimated loss is at least 230,000 yuan. However, 17 coppersmiths who were arrested have not yet been released, and their fate is uncertain. Although their families have tried to rescue them, there has been no news. It is widely rumored that they have been secretly executed.

### Inquiry Regarding the Prohibition of Native Cloth Sales in Fujian

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that the Native Cloth Association had reported news that the Fujian Provincial Government had prohibited the transportation of native cloth to Fujian. A special telegram was sent to the Fujian Provincial Government and the Fuzhou County General Chamber of Commerce, Silk and Cloth Trade Association to inquire.

### The French Concession Authorities Do Not Interact With Germans; No Construction or Business Licenses Are Issued; The Public Concession Takes a Different Stance

The Shanghai Times reported that, regarding the French Concession authorities' declaration that they will not interact with Germans within the concession, reporters inquired with the Municipal Council yesterday (the 13th) about the Council's attitude toward the rights of Germans, whether Jewish or not, within the Public Concession. According to a representative of the Municipal Council, the Public Concession allows people of all nationalities to live and do business, so the above question does not arise. It is noted that the French Concession Municipal Council declared on Thursday, through the French Consul General, that it had received instructions from Paris not to have any dealings with Germans and not to issue any construction or business licenses to holders of German passports. However, the Municipal Council is not subject to the sole control of any national government, and no capital city can issue orders to the Municipal Council, as the Municipal Council is only subject to the control of the Consular Body organized by the Consuls General of various countries stationed in Shanghai.

### The "Turtle" Trademark Lawsuit; Tiger, Turtle, Bear, and Deer Are Accused of Counterfeiting Trademarks

Chen Taiyan from Ningbo is in the Western medicine business. His Meiling Pharmacy recently produced a tonic called Tiger, Turtle, Bear, and Deer (also known as Wealth, Honor, and Prosperity) Kidney-Invigorating Pills. When it was launched, Chen published large-scale advertisements in various newspapers in Shanghai. It has been sold for more than half a year. Recently, Han Longzhou, the owner of the 63 Industrial Company, claimed that his company's Kidney Qi Pills had a turtle depicted on the trademark.

A Turtle Was Drawn

And Chen's product also has a turtle, which he believes is an allusion to counterfeiting. Initially, they published attacking articles in newspapers. Now, they have hired lawyers to file a lawsuit with the criminal court of the First Special District Court against Chen Taiyan for obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce, requesting that Chen be convicted of counterfeiting. At the same time, they filed a civil suit, requesting that Chen Taiyan be ordered to stop using the

Tiger, Turtle, Bear, and Deer

Name and destroy the bottles and boxes printed with the trademark, as well as publish an apology advertisement in various newspapers for three days. On the afternoon of the 14th, this case was heard by Judge Fang Qinghuan, who summoned the defendant Chen Taiyan. Chen Taiyan hired lawyers Qian Xingzhong, Rao Guangzu, Zhu Qichao, and others to appear in court and defend him, presenting the following evidence: (1) The defendant's product has already been submitted to the Trademark Bureau for

Legal Approval

And has a certificate of approval. (2) It has passed the inspection of the Municipal Council. (3) It has been resolved by the joint meeting of the Shanghai New Medicine Industry Association and the Pharmaceutical Industry Association to notify all members to sell it on consignment. (4) The color of the defendant's box is green, while the plaintiff's box is black. (5) The defendant's medicine is yellow, while the plaintiff's medicine is coffee-colored. (6) The turtle in the plaintiff's trademark

Is Very Large, While the defendant's trademark, in addition to a small turtle, also has three animals: tiger, bear, and deer. In this way, the defendant's product, regardless of the difference in the name, is clearly completely different in terms of medicine color, box color, and trademark. Customers can tell at a glance that they are two completely different products. How can it be said to be counterfeiting? Moreover, if the plaintiff in this case believes that there is a similarity in the trademark, he can

File a Dispute

With the Trademark Bureau according to the law. Now, the plaintiff does not seek this but violates the provisions of the Trademark Law and directly files a lawsuit. Moreover, the lawsuit was not filed when the defendant's drug was launched but several months later, which is obviously deliberately making trouble and should be rejected by the court, declaring the defendant innocent. After questioning by Judge Fang, the case was adjourned and will be summoned again after investigation.

### A Swindler Defrauds People of Money; The Civil Suit Concludes; The Defendant Admits He Cannot Afford to Repay

Wei Kuishun from Shaoxing, who worked as a runner in the Yishengheng Woolen Store at No. 64 Xingsheng Street, met Yang Dongsheng, a young con artist from Suzhou, in early July of this year while walking on Villemont Road. Yang was performing sorcery and boasting that he had a wonderful method to turn one yuan into ten yuan, and that poor people could become rich immediately. Wei

Mistakenly Believed It Was True

On the tenth day of this month, he took 1,000 yuan of relief money he had received, along with 11 yuan in small change he had on him, to Villemont Road to ask Yang to perform the transformation. Yang then colluded with his gang, Zhou Yunfei and Yuan from Ningbo, to set up a room in the Nanyang Small Hotel in Nanyang Bridge, ordering Wei to put the banknotes in a Buddhist yellow bag and kneel in front of a clay statue, waiting for them to perform the magic for three hours, after which it would turn into 10,000 yuan. Wei obediently held the yellow cloth bag and knelt in front of the statue,

Praying With His Eyes Closed

Yang and the others took this opportunity to flee with the money. Wei opened his eyes and looked into the cloth bag and found a roll of waste newspaper. After being defrauded, Wei reported the theft to the police station. The French police escorted him to the Second Special Court, where he was sentenced to 30 days of detention for false reporting, with a suspended sentence. On August 1, Wei was passing by Yinghua Street when he ran into the con artist Yang Dongsheng, who was also passing by. Wei grabbed him and took him to the Old Gate Police Station, who then transferred him to the Second Court.

Based on the Confession

Zhou Yunfei was subsequently arrested at No. 5 Ziyang Lane, Lafayette Road, and 70 yuan and a large number of swindling tools were found. Yang Dongsheng was sentenced to four months of imprisonment and Zhou Yunfei to six months of imprisonment for joint fraud, with a concurrent fine of 200 yuan each. The accompanying civil suit was heard by the Immigration Court. The case was heard by Judge Li of the First Special Court in the Civil Division 7 the day before yesterday. The plaintiff, Wei Kuishun, entrusted lawyer Xu Wufang to represent him in court, stating the

Swindling Process

As before, the court questioned the defendants Yang and Zhou, who confessed that they had only received 500 yuan of the stolen money, and the rest had been taken by someone named Yuan. We only had 70 yuan left, and the rest has already been used up. We are currently unable to repay it. The court reviewed the statements and announced the conclusion of the trial, scheduling the sentencing for the 18th.

### Husband Sells Drugs; Wife Arrested

Lu Da from Nantong, at 5 a.m. on the 10th of this month, was carrying a net basket containing six cans of biscuits, hired a rickshaw, and planned to go to the Bund to take a boat back home. At the intersection of Aiduoa Road and East Xin Bridge, he was searched by detectives, who found ten bags of morphine in the biscuit cans. He was taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. During the investigation at the police station, Lu confessed that he had bought the morphine from Chen Mingfu at No. 3 Mianshou Lane, Kangti Road. Detectives went to arrest Chen Mingfu, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. His wife, Chen Zhangshi, was arrested and sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Court the day before yesterday. Judge Liao interrogated her. The police lawyer requested an adjournment to be tried together with Lu Da. Chen Zhangshi confessed that her husband had been doing morphine business for a short time and that she did not know where her husband had fled. The court reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained pending trial together with Lu Da.

### Dispute Over a Stall Site Leads to Death

At around 10 a.m. yesterday, at the entrance of No. 54 Molly Street, Vegetable Market Street, French Concession, a vegetable vendor named Li Hede (57 years old) from Tianjin and a person nicknamed Ning Bi Agou were fighting over a stall site. As a result, Li Hede was seriously injured, and Agou escaped after the incident. Someone reported to the police station, and the police chief immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene, intending to send Li to the hospital. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died on the way. The body was transferred to the mortuary, waiting for a report to the Second Special District Court for inspection. Meanwhile, the police are looking for the murderer, hoping to catch and interrogate him.

### Younger Brother Violently Kicks Older Sister's Abdomen; Fetus Dies in Utero; Surgery Needed for Removal or Life Is in Danger; Li Miaoquan Arrested for Deliberately Causing Harm

Li Miaoquan (also known as He Lin) from Tongzhou, 28 years old, a chauffeur residing at No. 290 North Shanxi Road, is habitually violent. At 6 p.m. on the 8th of this month, he and his wife, Ms. Wang, were having dinner at their home at No. 4, Lane 349, North Henan Road, when his older sister, Ms. Zhu Li, arrived and demanded the repayment of 50 yuan owed to her. They started arguing and then

Started Fighting

Li kicked his sister's abdomen with his foot. Ms. Zhu Li was six months pregnant and, in extreme pain, fell to the ground and cried for help. People hired a car to send her to the Refugee Hospital on Xizang Road for treatment. By noon the day before yesterday, Ms. Zhu Li felt increasing pain in her abdomen. After a doctor's diagnosis, the fetus in her abdomen

Died in Utero

### Falsely Accused of Being Guerrillas; Extortion Attempt Exposed; Four Youths Arrested Together

Zhu Zhaogen, a local resident, 18 years old, currently studying at the China Vocational School on Carter Road, residing at 77 Panqing Road, French Concession, was suddenly visited by four well-dressed individuals at around 7:00 PM yesterday. The four claimed to be officers of the Japanese military headquarters. One of them, who was shorter, even claimed to be Japanese. The four told Zhu that Zhu had a friend named Zhang Yong, who was a guerrilla member and had been arrested. According to Zhang's confession, Zhu was also a guerrilla member, so they had come to investigate. They then repeatedly threatened and demanded 500 yuan to settle the matter. Zhu agreed to pay 300 yuan. Although the negotiation was successful, Zhu did not have the cash on hand. Zhu asked a friend to go out and raise the money. The friend realized that they were attempting to extort money and immediately reported it to the police. The police immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, who rushed to the scene in police vehicles and arrested the four individuals. According to the individual who impersonated a Japanese officer, his name was Lu Xiaofeng, 19 years old, a local resident. The other three individuals identified themselves as Chao Weizu, 19 years old, from Changzhou; Yan Wenkui, 19 years old, from Ningbo; and Guo Jiarong, 21 years old, from Changzhou. They confessed to attempting to extort money. After interrogation, the police chief ordered them to be detained and sent to the Second Special District Court for further investigation.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### Feng Yuxiang's Shoes and Food

— Yong

Feng Yuxiang is now the Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. In his childhood, he was just a child picking up scraps in the wilderness.

Because of poverty, he never even wore handmade cloth shoes when he was young. At home, he usually wore "second-hand shoes," which were old, worn-out shoes that were mended a little by a shoemaker. It is said that Feng Yuxiang had a foot ailment because he wore ill-fitting second-hand shoes at that time. When picking up scraps in the wilderness, he wore straw sandals; sometimes, he didn't even wear straw sandals and went barefoot.

Now, he still loves to wear cloth shoes made by his wife. He doesn't even want to look at Western-style leather shoes.

As for food, he also had a hard time when he was young. He rarely had meat more than a few times a year. For three meals a day, it was either sesame cakes or corn buns. In the 22nd year of the Republic, when he went to Shanghai, someone criticized him for eating sesame cakes and fried dough sticks for lunch. He said, "Being able to eat sesame cakes and fried dough sticks is like ascending to heaven for me!"

There is also an interesting anecdote: Whenever he went to Baoding, he always went to a food store called Ping Lao Jing on South Street to eat beef buns. Someone asked him, "Why?" He said, "Because the owner of that store once pawned a pair of gold-plated bracelets in a pawnshop. When he went to redeem them, the shop assistant gave him a pair of genuine gold bracelets, but he still returned them. I feel honored to eat at a store like that, not because the buns they make taste good."

### Hunan Students' Homespun Uniforms

— Wu

The development of education in Hunan is unmatched in the country. Taking the provincial capital as an example, schools are everywhere, and those in charge are able to work hard and manage effectively. The students also have a spirited and energetic attitude. As for the simple student uniforms, in the bustling streets, the students you see, whether male or female, wear a full set of homespun uniforms all year round. They rarely wear silk or woolen fabrics. In general, female students not only wear homespun skirts and jackets but also do not wear makeup. As for the homespun raw materials for making clothes, they are purely spun, woven, and dyed by themselves in the countryside. Only this can be called completely domestic products.

Their clothing is mostly a short jacket and short skirt. The upper body wears a plain-colored homespun jacket, and the lower body is paired with a plain-colored homespun skirt that reaches the knees. Their foreheads are covered with hair, and their eyes are bright. On the right side of their chests, the name of the school and the school-assigned number are embroidered with white yarn. Although they do not wear makeup, their light and plain attire has a unique style and reveals a natural and healthy beauty, which is unmatched by the female students in Jiangsu and Zhejiang who have bobbed their hair and wear fashionable clothes.

### Marshal Soy Sauce

— Jun

"Tonghai Soy Sauce is the best in Yunnan, Marshal Soy Sauce is the best in Tonghai." There are six or seven soy sauce manufacturers in Tonghai, and among the six or seven, Marshal Soy Sauce is the leader. Because Marshal Soy Sauce has been famous for its delicious taste and pure quality for three generations since its founding. Cooking dishes with it enhances the flavor, so in cooking, good and large dishes are all eager to use it to boast about their cooking skills. In recent years, its reputation has grown and sales have increased. There are no fewer than dozens of distributors in the surrounding eight prefectures and districts. Travelers passing through Tonghai also consider it a rare treat to buy and take a bottle with them. In Kunming, its value is said to be ten times higher. The total annual output is more than 200,000 catties. In terms of output, it can be considered a marshal. What is Marshal Soy Sauce? It is the famous "Tiao Ding Zhai."

Then, where did the name "Marshal" come from? According to the owner of "Tiao Ding Zhai," the name "Marshal Soy Sauce" has existed since ten years before the Republic of China. Because Tang Jiyao, the military governor of Yunnan, was very particular about food and drink, and every dish was inseparable from soy sauce, and he only ate soy sauce from "Tiao Ding Zhai." Because Tang Jiyao once held the rank of marshal (the Grand Marshal at the time was President Sun Yat-sen), the soy sauce was named after his honor. This is just like how Emperor Wu of Han named his book after obtaining a tripod, and how Shusun named his son after winning a victory. It is a marvel similar to the "Governor's Steamed Buns" of Yiliang, a strange anecdote in Yunnan.

### Walking and Health

— Ying Dai

If you can take the bus less when you go out, it can also improve your health, it's just that most people ignore this. People who live in cities are used to being pampered and always use cars and chartered cars for transportation. On weekdays, they only know that movie theaters and opera houses are places of entertainment and do not exercise. These young masters enjoy all the pleasures of the world, but their bodies are mostly weak and often get sick. This is the drawback of walking less and exercising less.

For working people, due to time constraints, in a city like Shanghai, they mostly take rickshaws, trams, and buses. In terms of physique, working people are also mostly thin and weak. Now, many people have felt the weakness of their bodies. The main reason is the lack of exercise, but some are limited by age, and some are due to the lack of public sports facilities in the city of Shanghai. Even though they know the drawbacks of lacking exercise, they do not exercise.

In fact, there is no fixed format for exercise methods; in other words, as long as a person's hands, feet, and body are constantly moving, it is also exercise. Therefore, a laborer is actually exercising all day long, even if he does not do various exercises, while only the young masters who sit in the office or just eat without doing anything are truly lacking exercise. We can exercise to strengthen our physique and make our bodies strong.

In my opinion, walking is also exercise and can make the body healthy, because when you walk, your hands and feet have to move, and your body also has to move. So I believe that walking can also improve health. I remember when I was in school, if it didn't rain every morning, I always walked to school. I had to walk along Avenue Edward VII and Beijing Road and turn into Sichuan Road, walking a long way in the morning and evening. At that time, my body was better than when I had not come to Shanghai. Recently, due to the war, my income has decreased, and I have also been practicing thrift, so I don't take the bus much when I go out and walk more. But recently my body has also been better than it was a year ago. I rarely exercise on weekdays; therefore, I have realized that walking does improve health.

In a city like Shanghai, some people have to take the bus because of their jobs, and some people pretend to be rich because they have money. Some jobs are not related, and they are not wealthy, but they still take the bus to save effort, while at the same time knowing that they lack exercise and are very weak, and wanting to exercise but are either limited by time or not good at exercising. In this situation, we might as well replace exercise with walking. It may not be impossible to improve our health!

### Interesting Facts

Shanxi people eat vinegar more than anyone else in the world. Also, women in Shanxi, after the age of 30, feel it difficult to walk without three legs; the so-called "three legs" are two feet and a cane.

The current location of the capital of Guizhou Province—Guiyang—has a road called "Salt Row Road." More than half of the shops on that road are salt shops, and most of the residents are salt merchants.

Mr. Soong Tse-ven often enjoys riding alone in the green fields in his spare time.

Mr. Wang Zhengting, the first ambassador to the United States, always had a cigarette or cigar in his mouth. When he had nothing to do at home, he would sit alone in a room, close his eyes, and smoke to pass the time.

Hui people like to eat beef and mutton, just like Shandong people like to eat green onions. Also, Hui people, regardless of men, women, old, or young, bathe once a week and take a small bath five times a day.

The Javanese live a simple life. They sleep and eat on the ground. What they wear, whether men or women, is just one "sarong." A sarong is shaped like an apron. Also, the people of Siam wear "sarongs."

German women are proud to marry men in military uniforms. Also, no makeup can be seen on the faces of German women. (Lian)

### A WEEK'S ECONOMICAL MENU

— Ms. Hua Ying

Shrimp is extremely expensive these days. Not to mention that it's rare to see it in everyday home cooking; even going to a restaurant and paying a high price for a plate of stir-fried shrimp, there are more green peas than shrimp, which isn't enough to satisfy one's appetite. As for whole prawns, they are long out of season, and although you can occasionally find them in Cantonese restaurants, they are all from the freezer. In my economical menu, shrimp has almost no place recently. If you absolutely must taste shrimp, then you have to rely on small white shrimp. Although small white shrimp also cost four or five cents an ounce, buying ten cents' worth, with added side dishes, can be divided into two bowls, enough for two meals, day and night. The methods are very common, and every household knows how to make them. One is scrambled eggs with small white shrimp, another is braising small white shrimp with tofu; another is stir-frying small white shrimp with chives, and another is braising small white shrimp with edamame, fragrant mushrooms, water chestnut tips, diced water bamboo shoots, and dried tofu, which is somewhat like "stir-fried ten delicacies."

### THE MOBILE HOME INSIDE AN AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE

— Xing

—Including the four aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation—

—Fully equipped with household facilities—

In America, there is a young traveler, Mr. James Smith, who has loved traveling since he was a child. Therefore, he designed and created a trailer for his car, which serves as a temporary home when traveling. The car is about seven feet wide and twenty-five feet long, with a streamlined design at both ends. Inside the car, there are three exquisitely equipped small rooms, and all the equipment in the rooms is modern. It includes hot and cold water taps, toilets, bathrooms, power supply, dining room, bedroom, etc., and can accommodate the living and dining needs of eight people. After the travel trailer was completed, he drove it from his hometown of Xuebo to the western coast of the state of Florida in the United States.

This novel way of traveling has aroused the interest of many Americans. Many fashionable people have followed suit. In less than five months, hundreds of them were found on this coast. As a result, some speculators have opened grocery stores, restaurants, hospitals, and even barber shops, bookstores, and laundries in these types of cars, providing everything needed. Therefore, this communal car family can maintain more than ten days of independent living without relying on any external supplies. If they get tired of playing in place A, they can immediately move from place A to place B.

The smallest of these types of cars can also accommodate the lives of a couple and a child. The car contains one or two small rooms, and all the equipment is very simple and exquisite. Common ones include a dining table, two single beds, two foldable chairs, a water tank that can hold twenty gallons, a refrigerator, a wardrobe, a wooden box for storing dining utensils, a bathtub with a showerhead, an electric stove for cooking, and a radio. Every item in the car can be folded and hidden when not needed. In short, the arrangement of each item is not annoying or inconvenient. In particular, every place in the corner of the car roof is properly utilized. At the rear of the car, a small platform is cleverly installed. When driving in the wild, you can sit on the platform and look at the scenery. As for the lights in the car, they usually use storage batteries, but in areas close to the city, they can also be connected to the city's alternating current.

Every summer, when the weather is hot, most of these cars drive to California to escape the heat. Speculators there have also established a square specifically for car families to rest, called the Car Family Concentration Camp. Staying in this concentration camp for a week costs one dollar per car. After paying the fee, you can enjoy free electricity and tap water. Therefore, tens of thousands of car families go there every year to escape the heat, and fifteen gas stations have also been established for these many car families.

In addition to living and traveling, this mobile family car can also be used for other purposes. Some people use it to open mobile shops, movie theaters use it as a mobile movie theater, and when film companies go to the wild to shoot outdoor scenes, movie stars can use it for makeup and rest. Hospitals use it as a mobile treatment room, and swimmers can use it as a changing room and rest room. In short, this type of car family is a novel discovery and a very interesting type of small family.

Spring and Autumn

### LANGUAGE EXHIBITION BEING PREPARED

— Xin Meng

The scope of items solicited is very broad.

Clearly demonstrates the evolutionary stages of the Chinese language.

The long-publicized language exhibition is said to officially open on November 3rd. It is initiated by the Chinese Language Education Society, which is organized by linguists and researchers in Shanghai. The scope of items solicited is very broad, and the deadline for submission is the 20th of this month. If you want to participate, you can send the items to the Medical Bookstore at 246 Meibaige Road. In order to find out more about the exhibition, I made a special trip to get a copy of the regulations for soliciting items, and also conducted a brief interview.

Indeed, the scope of this exhibition is very broad. In terms of classification, it can be listed as follows: (1) Tools for recording language; (2) Books and newspapers; (3) Charts and graphs; (4) Language and local customs; (5) Language seen on objects; (6) Lecture topics; (7) Performances; (8) Other items related to language. From this, we can easily see the broad scope of the items solicited for this exhibition. If you have research and interest in language items and actively participate, then this exhibition will definitely be quite spectacular.

Furthermore, regarding tools for recording language, models of knot-tying and knife pens, pens, ink, oracle bones, bark, bamboo slips, typewriters, printing tools, etc. are all included in the collection. In terms of books and newspapers: grammar books, dictionaries, newspapers, magazines, vernacular literature, Christian Bibles, Taoist scriptures, Buddhist scriptures, and texts in various Chinese minority languages, such as Manchu, Mongolian, Tibetan, Xixia, and Han Chinese books, etc. Charts and graphs include paintings, photographs, rubbings, calligraphy, inscriptions, and artistic characters related to language. Language and local customs include the Eight Trigrams, auspicious characters, auspicious words, talismans, and incantations. Objects include coins and stamps with characters on them. Lecture topics include language development, dialect research, and modern tools for transmitting language, such as telegraphs, telephones, wireless radio, and printing. Performances include performances of Braille, shorthand, telephones, new writing systems, dialects, and flag signals.

From the above, we can see that this exhibition is rarely seen in previous exhibitions, and such an exhibition can fully and clearly demonstrate the historical and evolutionary stages of the Chinese language. At the opening, the organizers will also compile and print a bilingual catalog of all the exhibits, free of charge, to be distributed to guests. I think people who care about language at that time will definitely rush to be the first to see it.

### THE LIFE OF A HARDWORKING STUDENT

— A Letter

I am a student who has been affected by the war and is suffering from economic oppression. I am currently studying in the senior high school department of Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School. Now I will tell the people of society about my daily life situation, and I hope that students in Shanghai who are economically wealthy will not waste money. My living situation is now described in detail below:

(1) Financial Income and Expenditure

Income: Relatives' subsidy of 60 yuan per semester,稿费 of newspapers and magazines, about 50 yuan per semester, and the rest relies on students' subsidies. Expenses: Tuition fee of 35 yuan, accommodation fee of 10 yuan, food fee of 50 yuan, and other miscellaneous expenses for books and stationery of 25 yuan.

(2) Source and Destination of Books

(1) Borrowed from students' fathers and brothers and relatives; (2) Purchased from old book stalls. This is the source of books. Their destination is also divided into two types: (1) Borrowed books are returned to the original owner; (2) Purchased books are sold to freshmen or second-hand bookstores. Therefore, after reading for a year, there are no books left after reading for a year.

(3) Utilization of Paper and Notebooks

Each piece of draft paper is written on three times: the first time is written in pencil, the second time is written in pen, and the third time is written in ink. Exercise books and composition books, etc., in addition to slightly adding a few copies, are all re-stapled from the unused or half-used ones from the previous semester.

(4) Diet and Living

Get up at 5:00 am and go to bed at 10:00 pm. In addition to reading and working time, all remaining rest time is only 40 to 50 minutes. In terms of diet, I eat nothing but one bowl of porridge and two meals a day, all year round. As for laundry, everything from quilts to socks is washed by myself.

The above is my daily life situation, which can be described as extremely difficult. If my relatives stop subsidizing me one day, then I will not be able to continue my studies, and the income from稿费 is not absolutely guaranteed. Compared with the children of wealthy families, the proportion of their lives can be described as heaven and hell. Therefore, the purpose of this manuscript is to hope that poor students like me will try their best to work hard in their lives; on the one hand, I hope that wealthy students will use this good environment to study hard and not waste time and money.

New Movie Introduction

### SNOWFLAKE DOUBLE BLOOM

— Qi Hua

"Winter Carnival"

"Snowflake Double Bloom" writes about the love story of a pair of sisters (Jill Buster and Ann Buster), with the winter festival at Dartmouth College as an interlude. The playwright uses the different experiences of the two sisters to clarify that young men and women should not treat love as a child's play, which is a good meaning, but in terms of writing skills, there are some shortcomings. Jill just divorced Duke Alex and met her old lover from six years ago, John, a young professor at Dartmouth College, at the festival. Their love comes to fruition, and the emotional process is well written, but Ann's infatuation with sweet words, abandoning Mike and transferring her love to Count Lenbog, is too hasty. Moreover, the reporter's running around by Tiger and Tang Ruinos, father and son, and the average development of the festival, weakened Jill's power to persuade Ann. At the same time, it made the whole play appear unusually loose. For example, at the end, Duke Alex brought a large number of newspaper reporters to visit Jill's whereabouts, and the simultaneous writing of the ice skating high jump competition made the director's hands and feet very obvious when Jill and John got together, and Ann and Mike reconciled.

Just because of the parallel development of these four lines (Jill and John; Ann and Mike: Tiger and Tang Ruinos; and the festival), the whole play cannot be tightly organized. The most important scene, Jill persuading Ann, can only be perfunctorily passed in the dance. But there are also a few very good scenes, such as John saying goodbye to Jill, the bleak atmosphere is very strong. John and Jill's night at a friend's house: wiping pots and taking care of children... The side description of them reliving their old dreams is also delicate and exquisite. That is, Jill dressed up to go to the dance floor and snatch Count Lenbog from Ann's arms. The different emotions of each person were also very moving.

The so-called "un" actress Ann Shirley Dan, on the contrary, Jill's role is played very well, but according to yesterday's news, she has been selected as one of Hollywood's four "un queens". The movie merchants' publicity is really confusing!

### AFTER THE RAIN, THE SKY CLEARS

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Sixteen: Planning to Establish Medical Science and Building a School, Thinking about Expanding Village Governance and Entrusting Children to a Suitable Place

However, Village Chief Zhu has always done things his own way and does not promote himself. Only a few people who know him admire his village governance and are pragmatic. People who don't know him still don't know him, and he doesn't hope that people will know him in any way. He is truly a person who "does not resent being unknown to others." However, the number of people who know about Freedom Village is gradually increasing. In this era of dispersing from the city to the countryside, many people have taken a fancy to this Freedom Village. For example, the He sisters initially wanted to go to Freedom Village because their father disliked Shanghai. Later, they suddenly launched a plan for a silk weaving factory, so the silk weaving factory was designed to open there. Because in the midst of this urban dispersal, no one wanted to open a factory in Shanghai anymore. Because land prices in Shanghai are expensive, labor costs are expensive, and everything is considered uneconomical. Since Freedom Village is the most suitable place for urban dispersal, it has gradually prospered, and land rents have also increased, which is inevitable. In addition to land rents, we must talk about village-run enterprises. Among the village-run enterprises, the first thing to talk about is collective farms. Freedom Village has several collective farms, all of which belong to the village. They divided them into the First Collective Farm, the Second Collective Farm,... until the Seventh Collective Farm. Naturally, these collective farms vary in size, depending on the region. However, this income is really the majority of the village's income. Just saying that Freedom Village has several nurseries, the annual appropriation is not small, and they are managed by several agricultural experts. Because the cultivation business in various provinces in inland China is rising like a storm. Many were originally wastelands that had never been reclaimed before. Some were originally cultivated land, but because of years of war, the old were transferred to gullies and ravines, and the strong were scattered in all directions, leaving the land barren. Now we have to reorganize from scratch. In addition to rice fields and wheat fields, trees are planted everywhere. What kind of soil is suitable for planting what kind of tree, this does not necessarily require agricultural experts with high skills, and even the old farmers and gardeners in China in the past can understand. Therefore, we must go to various farms to search for seedlings, on the one hand, to cultivate forests, even if it was originally a barren mountain, we must now teach it to become a forest. Village Chief Zhu said that he was a speculator in this regard. Because when Freedom Village was just organized and established, he set up several nurseries. That kind of nursery does not require much capital, and it can be opened by simply opening up a few acres of wasteland. Who knew that now, the seedlings in Freedom Village are famous throughout the country, but they have become oversupplied. (191)
