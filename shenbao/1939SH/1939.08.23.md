### Major Shift in the International Landscape: Soviet Union and Germany Sign Non-Aggression Pact; German Foreign Minister to Fly to Moscow Today for Signing; Anti-Comintern Pact Bankrupt, Where Does Japan Go?

Moscow – Following the conclusion of a commercial credit agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany, the issue of improving Soviet-German political relations has arisen. As a result of the exchange of views between the two governments on this matter, it has been determined that both sides are willing to ease tensions in political relations, thereby eliminating the crisis of war and concluding a non-aggression pact. Therefore, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will arrive in Moscow within days to conduct the necessary negotiations. (TASS dispatch, 21st)

Berlin – Huitong News Agency has learned from authoritative sources that Germany and the Soviet Union have agreed to sign a non-aggression pact. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to fly to Moscow on August 23, accompanied by Gaus, Director of the Legal Department of the Foreign Ministry, Counselor Wiehe, Director of the Intelligence Department Schmidt, and the famous translator Schmidt-Bellemer, among others. (Meitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin – Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, accompanied by 32 staff members, took a plane to Anisburg in East Prussia at noon today and will transfer to Moscow tomorrow morning. Political figures here claim that all issues have been resolved through diplomatic channels, and once Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrives in Moscow, the treaty will be completed quickly. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin – The news that Germany and the Soviet Union will sign a non-aggression pact came suddenly. All sectors of the Japanese community here were completely unprepared for this move by the two countries. Upon learning of it, they seemed extremely dismayed, all saying that the anti-communist public purpose is now of no value. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin – Japanese people here are very surprised to hear that Germany and the Soviet Union have agreed to a non-aggression pact. Japanese Ambassador Oshima has strongly advocated joining the German-Italian alliance. He convened a meeting of key embassy staff at midnight yesterday and afterwards sent a long telegram to the Tokyo embassy expressing great concern about the future fate of the Anti-Comintern Pact. (Havas, 22nd)

Tokyo – At this morning's cabinet meeting, the Soviet-German non-aggression pact and the Anglo-Japanese talks were discussed. Foreign Minister Arita said that the Anglo-Japanese talks had effectively broken down, but the Japanese government would decide its attitude after ascertaining Britain's true intentions. Arita also informed the cabinet members of the information regarding the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, saying that the information was not yet complete. The cabinet members then exchanged views on the new situation in Europe, but made no decision. The Ministry of the Army had not received official information and did not wish to express an opinion. However, all sectors of the army are now paying serious attention to this new move by Germany and the Soviet Union. This morning, administrative personnel of the Ministry of the Army held a meeting. The Ministry of the Army will issue a statement after receiving official information, explaining the army's attitude towards the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Tokyo – The official reports on the Soviet-German non-aggression pact from Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima and Ambassador to Italy Shiratori were delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:00 PM today. Foreign Minister Arita immediately visited Prime Minister Hiranuma at his residence at 3:30 PM, and they talked until 4:20 PM, holding a meeting to discuss Japan's plan to deal with this new situation. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Tokyo – According to critics here, Japan has received a painful lesson in any case: the spiritual constraint of the anti-communist public purpose has no force in Hitler's realistic policy. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Paris – The officialdom here was very surprised to learn that Germany and the Soviet Union were about to conclude a non-aggression pact. They all said that after the Soviet Union's western border was guaranteed, it would be free to act in the Far East, indicating that Japan had been sacrificed by its European allies. As for the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, they would inevitably be profoundly affected. Although the security system created by Britain and France would be hindered as a result, the ideological viewpoint of the German-Italian axis was also overturned. Germany's occupation of Bohemia and Moravia violated the racial doctrines of National Socialism. From now on, the principle of the anti-communist crusade no longer exists. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

### British and French Authorities Extremely Surprised and Panicked; Consider It a Major Blow to the Peace Front; British Parliament to Reconvene Tomorrow

London – Key figures here today not only expressed surprise but also panic at the news that Germany and the Soviet Union would sign a non-aggression pact, calling it a major blow to the British peace front. It is generally believed that the Soviet government, having negotiated with Britain and France for months without effect, has become impatient and is taking its final move. If the Western powers still do not accept its conditions, the Soviet Union is prepared to abandon them and allow Germany to achieve its ambitions in Poland. If necessary, Germany could extend its influence over the Balkan countries that have rejected Soviet military aid. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

London – Officialdom here has not yet commented on the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. All newspapers and non-officialdom have expressed surprise at the news. The Daily Mail said that if this is true, then the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact and the Axis anti-Comintern Pact are both invalid. The Daily Herald said that today's event directly encourages Germany to continue its actions against Poland. In other words, the Soviet Union is inviting Germany to do what it wants. Britain should convene Parliament immediately. The key to war and peace will be decided within days. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

London – After strong requests from the opposition parties in both the House of Lords and the House of Commons, both houses are very likely to reconvene on Thursday. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Paris – Unofficial circles were greatly shocked by the announcement that Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed to conclude a non-aggression pact. Officialdom has not yet commented on this. It is widely believed that one of the key figures behind this agreement must be the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Paris – Regarding the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, people in the Foreign Ministry here are all taciturn, saying only that the two countries concluded the Treaty of Rapallo on April 16, 1922, which has not yet been repealed. Their current relationship still has significant changes due to this treaty. German newspapers are currently making a big deal of it, indicating that the authorities there attach great importance to this matter psychologically. Observers analyzing the current situation said that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Britain and France were progressing slowly, so they induced Germany to provide guarantees that were even more advanced than what Britain and France could provide. (Havas, 22nd)

### British Cabinet Holds Meeting

London – The international situation continues to deteriorate, so today's cabinet meeting has been changed to a full cabinet meeting. The outcome is now of great concern to the British public. London officialdom believes that the British government's attitude remains completely unchanged, calm and strong, as before. Among the events to be considered by cabinet members today is a "declaration should be reissued by the British government, reiterating its attitude towards any act of aggression." However, the general opinion is that the British government's previous declarations on this matter have been extremely clear, and there seems to be no need for a new statement. Furthermore, it is not appropriate to stir up emotions with unnecessary remarks. However, cabinet members will review what they have seen and take the steps they deem necessary. The cabinet meeting is scheduled to be held this afternoon, so Prime Minister Chamberlain has the opportunity to meet with cabinet members in the morning to discuss matters with each other. Reuters diplomatic reporters have heard from officialdom that the Axis powers are certain that Britain and France are determined that if Poland conflicts with Germany because its independence is threatened, then Britain and France will back Poland. This cannot be answered by London, but the attitude of a democratic country, which should be understood by the Axis powers, goes without saying. It is generally acknowledged here that the British government has used correct and clear words to the best of its ability to explain its attitude and obligations, in order to safeguard peace. British Foreign Secretary Halifax stated on June 27, "In the event that further acts of aggression occur, we are determined to immediately use all our strength to fulfill our promise to resist aggression." Prime Minister Chamberlain later firmly stated that the Foreign Secretary's remarks represent the British government's considered policy. At today's meeting, cabinet members will study whether there are other ways, in addition to what the government has already done, to ensure that no one has any doubts about the meaning of the above promise. As everyone knows, any effort to distort Britain's attitude is a common trick, aimed at undermining trust in democratic countries and having a negative impact on neutral countries. Whether to convene the British Parliament may also be a question that cabinet members need to consider today. Before the regular session of Parliament adjourned, Chamberlain assured the House of Commons that if there were developments in the situation that warranted the convening of Parliament, the government would convene Parliament before the date of the resumption of Parliament on October 3. But Chamberlain also refused to advocate convening a special session of Parliament on August 22 at that time, so today the Prime Minister and other cabinet members may still believe that the convening of Parliament is not yet necessary or is not yet the time. The leader of the opposition party in the House of Commons, Greenwood, visited Chamberlain at Downing Street yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### Japan Suffers Triple Blow

London – Chinese officials and non-officials here have expressed satisfaction with the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, as this move allows the Soviet Union to have no worries about its western border and is free to deal with everything in the Far East. According to Chinese sources, since the United States announced the abolition of trade with Japan, and Britain refused to discuss the issue of Chinese legal tender and silver deposits in Tianjin, now there is the conclusion of this agreement, which has caused Japan to suffer a triple failure and has to change its entire policy. Japanese officials here are all keeping silent. The Japanese business community was already unhappy with the advocacy of joining the Axis by Japanese extremists, now saying that German propaganda in Japan has been completely successful so far. It began by guiding public sentiment to resist the Soviet Union, and then in recent months shifted its target to concentrate public sentiment against Britain. Now that Germany and the Soviet Union have concluded a non-aggression pact, Japan should understand that Germany's words and actions do not match, or it may return to its former mood and become more friendly with Britain, which is also possible. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Berlin – Regarding the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, observers here said that Germany had notified Italy in advance, but not Japan. Officials did not want to comment on the fate of the Anti-Comintern Pact, only stating that the pact was based on ideology, while the non-aggression pact was political in nature, and that it did not interfere with the obligations that Germany and the Soviet Union had accepted towards third countries. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

### Turning Enemies into Friends: German Newspapers Report Extensively; Hailing It as a Great Success; Germans Bewildered

Berlin – People in Berlin were greatly surprised to see the news in the morning newspapers that Germany and the Soviet Union were about to conclude a non-aggression pact. The two countries, National Socialist Germany and Bolshevik Russia, with their vastly different ideologies, suddenly changed their relationship overnight, which was truly unexpected. German newspapers all published the news with extremely large headlines. The National Socialist Party's organ newspaper printed two eight-inch long red-letter headlines on the entire front page. However, the newspapers did not write a single word of commentary. Readers were bewildered, not knowing what path Germany would take. The negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union were conducted in great secrecy, and almost no one knew about them except for a few top officials. Even government spokesmen expressed great surprise. People in foreign political circles in Berlin regarded this as a great success for Germany, which would completely change the European political situation, and regarded it as the starting point for more important developments. The world is now watching with great interest how this move by Germany will affect Germany's relations with Spain and Japan. It is expected that Japan will be very disappointed with the rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union, as Japan has undoubtedly relied on its closer relationship with Germany in order to be detrimental to the Soviet Union. German political circles are very pleased with this agreement, saying that this matter was unexpected by the Allied countries. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Editorial

### Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact

The imminent signing of a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany is an unexpected piece of news in the newspapers, an unexpected change in the international situation, and an unexpected lesson for politicians.

To elaborate on this matter, we must first clearly understand the outline of the event. According to a Berlin dispatch from the German National News Agency Huitong News Agency yesterday, August 22: Germany and the Soviet Union have agreed to sign a non-aggression agreement, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to fly to Moscow on the 23rd, accompanied by his subordinates, the directors of the Legal Department and the Propaganda Department. According to a Moscow dispatch from the Soviet National News Agency TASS yesterday: As a result of the exchange of views between the Soviet Union and Germany, it has been determined that both sides are willing to ease the tense situation in political relations in order to eliminate the war crisis and conclude a non-aggression agreement. The German Foreign Minister will arrive in Moscow within days to conduct the necessary negotiations. The two countries and the two news agencies each issued dispatches from their respective capitals, each with its own details, but the main points were the same. In short, both sides expressed a strong desire to sign a non-aggression pact, but it remains to be negotiated and has not yet been established.

At this point before it has been established, it should be regarded as a matter of both success and failure, until the end of the negotiations. The so-called non-aggression pact can have any content, that is, problems can arise in the clauses. The location of the problem is not necessarily harmonious. Let's raise a doubt: Is aggression towards us narrowly defined, or broadly defined? If the aggression does not extend to the homeland of the signatory country, but in addition to the homeland, there are so-called neighboring countries that are vital to survival, can they also be aggressed against? If a neighbor vital to survival is seized without force, can it not be called aggression? The negotiations between the Soviet Union and Britain and France took the issue of guaranteeing the security of the three Baltic states as one setback, and the definition of indirect aggression as another setback, because the Soviet Union regards the three countries as vital to the Soviet Union's survival. How is the Soviet Union striving for it with Britain and France, and how is it compromising with Germany? This newspaper once said, "The Soviet Union handles all issues meticulously." Compromising with Germany is impossible. Therefore, the future of the Soviet-German negotiations should not be regarded as without problems.

However, we would rather judge from various perspectives that the Soviet and German negotiations to conclude a non-aggression pact will be concluded. In other words: Although there are various internal and external difficulties in the negotiations between the two countries, the non-aggression pact that both sides are eager to conclude will not only not be aborted due to difficulties, but also will not be a difficult birth, but will be completed quickly. Now there is no time to elaborate on the basis of our judgment, so let's assume that the judgment is not wrong, take it as a basis and elaborate on it.

After the Soviet Union and Germany formally sign the non-aggression pact, at least since the last year (?), everything related to the international community: the foreign policies of various countries, military standards, the division of friends and enemies, the debate on doctrines: whether it is a public fact form, a plan to work hard with one's head buried, a contest of strategy and retreat, or a thunderstorm of propaganda and agitation; none of them do not need to be re-evaluated, re-considered; and even must start anew and be thoroughly changed. To analyze it in detail, words cannot express it. Indeed, the nature of the non-aggression pact seems to be passive prevention rather than active action. The protagonists now seem to be only the Soviet Union and Germany, and have nothing to do with other countries, but the impact will be so great that even the most restrained will no longer be able to pretend to be calm.

What is the impact? Taking the protagonist of the signing as an example: On the Soviet side, with National Socialist Germany, their very nature as founding nations makes them like water and fire, and Germany is the center of the Anti-Comintern Pact, which has led to a very sharp confrontation between the two countries. Now that the non-aggression pact has been concluded, it is like water and fire in different vessels, each with its own merits. This is its meaning. Although it is regarded as mutual recognition and respect for each other's doctrines, and mutual understanding and security in essence: this is one point. The two countries are in confrontation. Germany has always expressed no compromise with the Soviet Union, and Germany's aggressive policy is allowed to show people at any time and place that it will try its edge, which is deeply unsettling for the Soviet Union. Therefore, there is first a mutual assistance pact with France, and then discussions with Britain and France on mutual assistance methods. In short, the Soviet Union feels that it cannot be without friends and cannot be isolated from the whirlpool of the European situation. Now that the non-aggression pact has been concluded, the Soviet Union has not only no enemies in Europe, but has also crossed its only trench and shook hands with the enemy: this is the second point. The Soviet Union spans both Europe and Asia, and Germany and Japan have long been allied, appearing to strangle its eastern and western ends. Now that the non-aggression pact has been concluded, the Soviet Union no longer has to worry about its western border. Whether the Soviet Union will then take action in the Far East is another question, but from now on it has the possibility of acting freely and the possibility of acting with full force: this is the third point.

On the German side, since Hitler became the leader, he has been strengthening the military and preparing for war, and has no regard for Eastern and Central Europe. Even for Western Europe, it is dismissed. Only the Soviet Union is not only incompatible in terms of national ideology, but also the only strong enemy in terms of military strength and strategy. Judging from the speeches of the leader Hitler, his arrogance is boundless, but he has long ceased to attack communism, which shows his great concern. When Czechoslovakia was conquered, Britain and France became determined to show their strength, and Moscow was sought after by Britain and France. If the Soviet Union readily accepted the wishes of Britain and France and formed a strong and capable group, even if Germany wanted to leap forward, it would not be able to break through the grasp of those who "surrounded" it. The fatal wound of the aggressive policy is also the death knell of the National Socialist regime, which Hitler was very angry about. Now it has concluded a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, the meaning of which is not that Germany has gained a close friend or that aggression has gained an accomplice, but directly that the Soviet Union is no longer Germany's enemy, and indirectly that the Soviet Union no longer helps Britain and France to be enemies. Since Hitler took control of German politics, this is an unprecedented diplomatic success.

The important key points of this influence on the international situation are two: (1) The content of the non-aggression pact will almost certainly stipulate something about the survival and abolition of the treaty. If it is stipulated that one party to the signing country has any aggressive behavior towards a third country, the other party to the signing country may declare the abolition of the treaty. If so, the international situation will indirectly gain considerable stabilizing force. (2) After signing this treaty, how does Germany intend to think? What is its spirit? How will it act? Under the tacit understanding of the Soviet Union, what path and method will it take to implement its wishes? Everything is unpredictable. These two key points all depend on the German side. In addition to these two, study its impact individually. Germany has its heart set on Danzig, and will certainly not abandon its desire for Danzig as the price for obtaining the Soviet Union's signing of a non-aggression pact. Moreover, in terms of Danzig's geography and history, and in terms of its economy and bloodline, Poland will inevitably find it difficult to hold Danzig for long. But it is not only Danzig that has become a problem. Therefore, the impact of the establishment of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact will be closest and most significant to Poland, which will be in distress, confusion, and even sorrow. Germany, Italy, and Japan are known as allies, Germany and Italy are real, and Germany and Japan are false. It is true that they echo each other in diplomacy, and it is false that they jointly oppose communism in belief. Japan is unwilling to vigorously assist Germany and Italy in the European situation, and Germany and Italy are unwilling to sacrifice the market in the Far East. Japan wants to swallow China alone, and Germany and Italy have no old grievances against China. However, Japan believes that Germany and Italy are happy to be used, and that anti-communism can be used as a slogan. Therefore, the international situation has been brewing and evolving to another level, and Japan is still clinging to the past, still believing that the anti-communist public purpose is necessary and has a wonderful use. How could it know that Germany has removed the anti-communist banner, asked Italy for its consent, and is negotiating a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. Japan is still in the drum, still outside the door! Therefore, how Japan will deal with itself in the future is another question, but the fact that the international community proves that it is isolated is undeniable. As for Britain and France, after gaining this great lesson, they must have a profound understanding. They have been pursuing the Soviet Union for half a year, hoping to make it their ally in politics and military affairs. When the Soviet Union was uneasy about Germany's aggressive arrogance, they were not unmoved. Now that the Soviet Union and Germany have each gotten what they wanted, the efforts of Britain and France have failed. It is truly no different from being in love, then unrequited love, and then broken-hearted. Diplomatically speaking, Britain and France have failed greatly, but the negotiations between Britain and France and the Soviet Union have not been abandoned halfway because of this, and the achievements obtained in the future will be at least equal to the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union. Moreover, Britain and France's national strength and prestige can only be insulted by themselves, and cannot be easily insulted by others. Therefore, although Britain and France have suffered a regrettable setback, they have actually not been weakened at all.

### German Side Expects Important Negotiations Among Nations, Seeking a Comprehensive Solution to the Eastern European Problem, Germany and Poland Still Engaging in Military Preparations

Berlin: It is generally said here that major countries' governments and politicians will conduct extremely important negotiations in the near future, and international affairs will therefore have decisive developments. The people, upon hearing the news, feel a sense of relief, believing that the current crisis can be peacefully resolved. Those in charge also predict that the Danzig issue can be quickly advanced. It is also said that what Germany is demanding includes not only the city of Danzig, but also any place within Poland where a majority of Germans reside, such as the Polish Corridor, Poznan Province, and Upper Silesia. Some say that the Germans in these areas can be exchanged for Poles within Germany. It is understood that Germany's hope is to greatly transform Eastern Europe politically, not just to resolve outstanding issues with Poland. However, some say that Germany's prestige and destiny are in a dangerous stalemate, and that the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union provides a glorious way out. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)

Warsaw: Well-informed sources here claim that the situation is increasingly tense, and there may be shocking developments by the end of this week. Polish newspapers are more cautious in their pronouncements compared to Germany's intense propaganda. The "Polska" newspaper's Berlin dispatch states that Hitler's speech in Tannenberg on August 27th will be astonishing. However, it is not yet known whether his words are an excessive response to Poland's memorandum of May 5th, or whether they will destroy all channels of communication, causing the situation to reach extreme tension. However, judging from Hitler's psychology, the latter is more likely. The "Wieczór Warszawy" newspaper said that Hitler previously made very unpopular moves on the issue of Italian immigrants in Tyrol. He could now take some action to win back people's hearts, namely, to abandon the idea of war. However, in any case, Poland must prepare for all eventualities. For this reason, Poland and its allies are prepared. (Reuters, 22nd)

Berlin: The tense atmosphere here seems to be increasing. People generally believe that new developments will occur soon. General Göring, the Air Force Minister's mouthpiece, "National-Zeitung," commenting on the Anglo-Polish treaty, said that this matter, like other important issues, will be decided this week. Political circles also believe this, saying that Polish atrocities cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. At the same time, according to reliable sources, Germany's trial mobilization is progressing rapidly. The gathering of nurses, the organization of propaganda teams, the inoculation of soldiers, and the requisitioning of vehicles are actively underway. However, the shortage of automobiles is worse than before. Cologne and other towns in the Rhine region have begun three-night blackouts. Berlin officials are extremely secretive about everything and offer no opinions. However, German political circles still claim to be optimistic, but cannot explain the reasons for their optimism. Many people believe that Britain will not go to war over the Danzig issue. (Reuters, 22nd)

Berlin: According to news received here last night, the tense situation on the German-Polish border is becoming increasingly dangerous. Germans fleeing from Poland are forming large groups. In the past two days, more than two thousand Germans have fled. Poland is increasingly engaged in military construction in various locations. Machine-gun positions and trenches have been set up in the Tczew area. Roads near Świecie have been reinforced with steel-reinforced concrete military obstacles. Reinforcements have been sent to the border areas, from Debrzno to Szczytno. The highway bridge from Poland to Moravia has been completely destroyed. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

Berlin: The long-distance telephone line between Berlin and Warsaw was suddenly cut off last night. According to the Berlin telephone bureau, this was because the Polish side cut the cables. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

Danzig: The authorities in this city are actively making military preparations and are rushing to build defensive fortifications along the Polish border. Even on Sundays, work continues as usual. Anti-aircraft guns have been installed along the coast, and barbed wire has been placed around the city. The city authorities have also requisitioned civilian trucks. The situation is tense, and rumors are rampant. It is said that this city will soon be incorporated into Germany. The general population is extremely anxious. The Nazi Party has repeatedly stated that Poland will encounter decisive setbacks in the next few days, and that Germany's goals will be achieved as predicted. However, there are conflicting rumors about what steps Germany will take. Some say that all Polish customs officials at the city's customs office will be expelled. Others say that the city authorities will take over the city's railway lines, which are the property of the Polish government. However, Polish people here remain calm, saying that all the rumors are just intimidation. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

### Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Exceptionally Busy, Newspapers Still Mocking Poland, Advocating Direct Negotiations with Germany

Rome: Rumors say that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano returned to Rome from Albania to convene a meeting of Germany, Britain, France, and Poland to seek a peaceful resolution to the current problem. Well-informed sources in Rome seriously deny this, saying that Ciano did not meet with any diplomatic representatives all day yesterday, which shows that the rumors are not credible. Semi-official Italian newspapers continue to maintain a consistent tone, strongly urging Poland to negotiate directly with Germany, and at the same time advising Britain and France not to interfere. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

Rome: Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here is exceptionally active, it has revealed no signs of what it is doing. It is believed that the Italian ambassador to Germany, Attolico, met with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano last night. It is heard that Attolico met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Munich, but did not meet with Hitler. The "Il Popolo d'Italia" newspaper today published an editorial, first commenting on the critical situation, and then asking Britain and France to consider their responsibilities to the world and the future of their peoples and empires at this most important moment. It also said that France's last-minute appeal for Italy to mediate in order to save peace is truly remarkable. The French must reread their words against Italy during the Munich Conference and recall everything France has done to Italy's interests. Italy's policy is the Axis policy. Italy has advised Poland to conduct direct negotiations with Germany. If this, a timely mediation, is not understood and followed, it is not Italy's fault. (Reuters, 22nd)

### The Pope's Anxious Gaze Upon Difficult Times

Vatican City: Rumors that the Pope has sent a special envoy to Warsaw have been denied here today. It is heard that the Vatican's envoy to Poland, Renzivo, is in Warsaw handling the Vatican's diplomatic affairs. According to Vatican sources, the Pope cannot and does not want to make any specific suggestions for resolving the crisis, because he still wants to remain outside the disputes that are not within his mission. However, the Pope earnestly hopes that everyone will pay attention to their duty to save mankind from the scourge of war. The Pope also asks those who can influence major changes to always have a sense of responsibility. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Polish Ambassador to Germany Suddenly Returns Home, Newspapers Give Little Coverage to News of German-Soviet Understanding

Warsaw: Following the decision by Germany and the Soviet Union to conclude a non-aggression treaty, the Polish ambassador to Germany, Lipski, returned here from Berlin yesterday at midnight on a special plane. He was immediately received by Foreign Minister Beck. The French ambassador to Poland, Noël, also visited the Foreign Minister for talks shortly afterwards. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)

Warsaw: Regarding the agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union to negotiate a non-aggression treaty, the semi-official Polish Press Agency has issued a statement saying, "This action by Germany and the Soviet Union has not caused a deep impression in our political circles. The balance of power in Europe has not undergone any major changes as a result. What we can say is that the Soviet Union has now openly withdrawn from the European political stage. This can already be seen from the protracted indecision of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations. Our attitude remains the same."

### Anglo-French-Soviet Mutual Assistance Negotiations Can Still Continue

Moscow: Responsible officials here have stated that the non-aggression treaty to be signed between Germany and the Soviet Union is not a treaty of assistance to aggression. All previous non-aggression treaties concluded by the Soviet Union with other countries contained an extreme clause stipulating that if one of the signatory countries commits aggression against a third country, the other country can automatically invalidate the treaty. This will also be the case this time. In addition, the Soviet Union and Britain and France can still conclude an agreement, and will not be affected by this decision in any way. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)

London: According to news received here, talks between Britain and France in Moscow will continue. However, according to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the military representatives of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union did not hold a meeting this morning. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Japanese Delegation to Arrive in Italy, Led by Terauchi Daisuke

Rome: The Japanese delegation, led by former Minister of War Terauchi Juichi and Admiral Rokkaku Shigenari, will arrive at the port of Naples on August 28. The delegation will stay in Italy for a long time. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd). The newspapers have not given this prominent coverage. Most newspapers only mention it on the second page in a few lines, which shows that the government does not want to overemphasize this matter or cause the public to have a bad impression. As for the comments made by the newspapers, they only state that the Soviet Union has effectively withdrawn from the European political stage and is fully dealing with the Far Eastern problem. Political figures here say that this is Germany's strategy to deal with Poland and the Western European democracies. The future attitude of Poland must wait until the reaction of Britain and France is determined. In addition, the question of what impact this action by Germany and the Soviet Union will have on the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Far Eastern situation is of great concern to the general public here. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)

### American Observations

(Washington) According to observations by senior government officials and those familiar with current affairs here, if Germany and the Soviet Union conclude a non-aggression treaty, the position of Germany and Italy will be greatly strengthened, making it possible for Germany to forcefully resolve the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues. However, some political circles still harbor doubts about the conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty. They believe that this stance by the Soviet Union is either to pressure Britain and France to accept the Soviet Union's demand for a military alliance. (Associated Press, 22nd)

New York: News that Germany and the Soviet Union will sign a non-aggression treaty has drawn great attention here. This morning, newspapers here carried the headline in large letters: Hitler's "Diplomatic Masterstroke". However, officials are still taking a cautious and silent attitude towards this matter. The New York Times said that the motive for this news may be false propaganda. If it is true, the impact will be great. It seems that Stalin is attempting to avoid Soviet participation in the European war. In other words, the Soviet Union's main interests are in the Far East. Furthermore, if this treaty is concluded, the balance of power in Europe will immediately change, dealing a severe blow to Poland. The newspaper's London correspondent said that if this treaty is concluded, Britain will suffer a great disgrace, and Germany will win another diplomatic victory. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

Los Angeles: Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said today that in recent months, there has been no greater crisis or possibility of war in Europe than today. He said that although he advocates American neutrality, "the United States cannot be completely indifferent to changes in the situation in Europe." (Associated Press, 21st)

### British Nationals in Poland Ordered to Evacuate, German Embassy Staff Also Returning Home One After Another

The Japanese troops retreated northward. Earlier, the Chinese troops advanced towards Jincheng from the east on August 10. After two days of fierce fighting, they finally reached the western suburbs of the city. At the same time, another Chinese mobile unit also arrived in the bushes north of Jincheng. The Japanese troops then launched an offensive against the main force of the Chinese troops west of the city under the cover of heavy artillery.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Sincerely Concerned About People's Livelihood, Bumper Harvest in Sichuan Province This Year, Deeply Concerned About Low Grain Prices Harming Farmers, Telegraphically Instructed President Kong of the Executive Yuan to Instruct Practical Relief Measures

Chongqing: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in view of the bumper harvest in Sichuan this year, and deeply concerned that low grain prices would harm farmers and affect people's livelihood, telegraphed to President Kong of the Executive Yuan today, instructing relief measures. Kong, President of the Executive Yuan, is informed that according to reports from various sources, Sichuan has seen a bumper harvest this year, which is beneficial to the people's food and military supplies. This is a gratifying thing during the War of Resistance and is truly comforting. However, observing the situation among the people, there are two phenomena: one is that as a result of the bumper harvest, grain prices in various places have uniformly fallen, which has caused low grain prices to harm farmers; the other is that due to the high prices of other commodities, wages have increased accordingly, so that some poor farmers are watching the abundant harvest of crops, but are unable to afford to hire workers to harvest them. Upon learning of this, I am deeply concerned. In addition to my telegraphic order to the troops and security teams stationed in various places to earnestly assist farmers in speeding up the harvest to protect grain production, the issue of low rice prices should be handled jointly by the central government and the Sichuan Provincial Government. They should quickly plan practical and effective measures to actively maintain reasonable prices. On the part of the central government, a fund should be allocated from the national treasury, instructing the Agricultural Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Farmers Bank to ascertain the total rice production in the province, conduct practical planning, formulate the quantity to be purchased, determine appropriate prices, and plan for large-scale purchases. On the other hand, the Ministry of Finance should instruct public and private banks to do their best to assist in this matter. Applications for loans from institutions that purchase agricultural products for non-profit purposes should be reviewed based on the actual situation to facilitate them. Tangible collateral should be regarded as the most secure, and should not be rejected because it is cumbersome. On the part of the provincial government, in addition to the provincial local banks being responsible for providing as much funding as possible at the local level in each county, they should also order cooperative organizations, food management organizations, and county governments throughout the province to assist in the purchase, so that the central and local governments can work together and closely link up. It must be ensured that each county in the province, to the best of its ability, can ensure that genuine farmers obtain the actual benefits of this year's bumper harvest, so that they can stabilize their livelihoods. My concern for people's livelihood is extremely sincere. Please have the Executive Yuan preside over and supervise the immediate dispatch to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Sichuan Provincial Government to swiftly follow the above-mentioned guidelines and proceed immediately, informing all subordinate competent authorities to expedite the work without delay. The specific implementation methods should be submitted as a basis for assessment, and the competent authorities should also report the implementation methods at any time. All the handling situation should be reported. Chiang Chungcheng, the 22nd in Chongqing. (Dispatch, 22nd)

### Fenggang County Organizes Volunteer Corps

Guiyang: Chen []tao, the county head of Qian Fenggang, is working hard on conscription propaganda in the county, so the awareness of the War of Resistance is deeply rooted in people's hearts. Currently, there are more than 1,500 people in the county who are willing to serve as volunteers. All of the county's social training instructors, conscription section chiefs, secretaries, district chiefs, etc., have voluntarily participated. Principals, teachers, and students have also strongly requested to participate, reaching more than 300 people. This has set a new record for voluntary military service in various places since the War of Resistance. Chen has now organized the Fenggang Volunteer Corps and has resigned from his post as county head. He intends to request to be transferred to serve as the commander of the corps, leading these more than 1,000 able-bodied men to the front lines. Once approved, they will go to Chongqing for training and then transfer to the front. (Dispatch, 21st)

### The National Government Decides to Plan the Establishment of Reclamation Zones to Settle Refugees

Chongqing: The National Government has now decided to establish "National Reclamation Zones" to settle wartime refugees, so that they can obtain living space and occupations.

### Anti-British Tide in South China Has Not Yet Been Launched

Guangzhou: According to observations by foreigners here, the Japanese army in South China currently has no intention of launching an anti-British movement. It is heard that the Japanese army in North China had asked the Japanese army in South China to also launch an anti-British movement, but the Japanese army in South China did not agree. They only slightly searched the Chinese people entering and leaving the concessions, but it only lasted for a few days, and then it was stopped. At the same time, it was once forbidden for Chinese people to be employed as foreign employees, and Chinese servants who brought food for foreigners were deliberately harassed, but after diplomatic protests, it was stopped again. The treatment of British people arriving in Guangzhou by sentries is no different from that of people of other nationalities. According to a Japanese military spokesman, the Japanese side is now paying attention to the effect of Wang Jingwei's activities to determine future actions. (Associated Press telegram on the 21st)

### A Man Shot Dead in Front of the Hong Kong Nanhua Daily, Rumored to be Wang's Nephew or Cousin, Three Assassins Acted Swiftly

The three assassins acted extremely swiftly, completing the matter in just a few seconds and calmly leaving. (Associated Press telegram on the 22nd)

### Economic Situation in the Occupied Areas

Chongqing: According to a government official who has returned from inspecting various provinces in Central China, the economic problem in the occupied areas is more important than the political one. Taking Anhui as an example, Japanese goods are everywhere. The large ones are transported in from Shanghai, and they all have counterfeit Chinese trademarks, so it is extremely difficult to identify them. The Chinese side has now hired experts to identify them. Another serious problem is the Japanese side's use of economic resources in the occupied areas. The method is to have the Japanese side exclusively buy and sell the main products. For example, the rice in Wuhu has been purchased in large quantities by the Japanese side, and the price has risen to 20 yuan per dan (unit of weight), but on the opposite bank of the river, it is only sold for 6 yuan per dan. It is also said that although Anhui's finances are difficult, income and expenditure can still offset each other. The difficult thing is actually the currency system problem.

### The Tianjin Four Chinese Case: The British Supreme Court Heard the Case Yesterday; The Foreign Secretary's Representative Attended and Stated the Government's Opinion

London: This morning, when Supreme Court Judge Caisells heard the case of the habeas corpus writ for the four suspects in Tianjin again, the applicant was represented by Sir Cornwall, the Public Prosecutor, and civil representatives. Sir Listowell, in the affidavit submitted in the name of the Aid China Movement Committee, strongly stated that the American side's intention to extradite the four people to the Japanese side was completely illegal and unjust. According to the provisions of the Tianjin Treaty, the British authorities can hand over these four people to the Chinese authorities, but there is no reason to extradite them to the Japanese side. Mr. Monckton strongly stated that because there is currently no legally organized Chinese government in Tianjin, it would be inappropriate to hand over these four people to a court of an usurper. "There is undoubtedly a legally organized Chinese court in Shanghai. The Shanghai court has requested in the past few days that these four people be handed over to that court for trial." Mr. Monckton also said that there is currently no fact that can indicate that the Chinese authorities in Tianjin have inherited the treaty rights that the Chinese side there should enjoy. Mr. O'Connor, who represented Foreign Secretary Halifax, argued that the Tianjin court still exists and performs its duties. It is absurd to request that these four suspects be sent to London. He really could not say how many warships of the domestic fleet would be needed to achieve this goal. The lawyer representing the applicant did not indicate who entrusted him to issue this request for these four people. He deeply suspected whether these four people themselves were willing to make this request. Mr. O'Connor also said that the habeas corpus writ could not be issued to the Foreign Secretary, because the Foreign Secretary had no jurisdiction over these four people, just as he did not. All the Foreign Secretary can do at present is to convey the advice he received in London to the British Ambassador to China. Furthermore, this kind of habeas corpus writ does not and has never had anything to do with foreigners abroad. It was announced at the beginning of the case that it would be heard publicly in court.

### After Returning Home, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Issues a Statement, Still Emphasizing National Honor, Acknowledging Pressure from Germany and Italy

Budapest: Foreign Minister Csáky recently gave an interview to a reporter from the semi-official Hungarian News Agency, stating, "All the rumors caused by my visit to Germany and Italy are not true.

We have always emphasized national honor, but we also do not want to have any estrangement with friendly countries." (Havas telegram on the 21st)

Budapest: After returning from Germany, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky claimed that no one in Germany or Italy had made any demands on the Hungarian government or its Foreign Minister. It is reported that Csáky met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Germany, and then visited Hitler at Berchtesgaden. Although Csáky declared to a Hungarian newspaper reporter that he was temporarily residing in Germany in a purely private capacity and was not conducting negotiations with anyone, it is generally believed that Germany wants Hungary to join the Axis military alliance, so that Hungary will be bound by military, political, and financial restrictions.

### Stalin: The Trend of Foreign Policy

After Germany annexed Czechoslovakia on March 15th of this year, British Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately suggested to the Soviet Union that they form a tripartite alliance against aggression between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, to resist the Axis powers of Germany and Italy. The Soviet Union immediately accepted, and negotiations began. It has now been more than five months, and they are still negotiating. The international situation is critically dangerous, yet they proceed with such composure and ease. This is truly a rare event in diplomatic history. It is all because Chamberlain harbors ulterior motives, fearing that if the alliance succeeds and the three nations of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union defeat Germany, the Soviet Union's power will reach Central Europe, making it extremely difficult to deal with in the future. At the same time, because of Germany's aggression, the situation is perilous, so he is using negotiations for an alliance with the Soviet Union to continue promoting his appeasement policy, hoping that Germany will therefore comply and achieve a temporary peace. What kind of person is Hitler? How could he be intimidated? And what kind of person is Stalin? How could he willingly be used? As a result, Germany's aggression has intensified step by step, and the Soviet alliance has become a pipe dream. According to recent telegraphic reports, Germany and the Soviet Union have signed a credit loan agreement and will soon conclude a non-aggression pact. It is unknown what magical powers Chamberlain will have to deal with this. The following is an excerpt from the American publication "Modern History," which explains Stalin's foreign policy very clearly. Reading it can reveal the reasons why the Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been so slow to succeed. As for the end of the article, which hopes that Stalin will join the democratic countries rather than the Axis powers, that is the American standpoint, and of course, they would make such a suggestion. In short, if the Soviet-German non-aggression pact is established, or if there are further actions, it will all be the consequence of Chamberlain's "insincerity." Translator

"To make Germany and the Soviet Union fight each other is a blessing for Britain because if these two countries fight until they are bloody and bruised, Britain will become even stronger." This was a striking statement made by Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov during his May 31st speech on foreign policy. Although this speech still left the door open for continued negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, he believed that the proposals made by Britain and France to enlist Moscow's support for an anti-aggression agreement were insufficient and therefore rejected them.

When the Soviet Communist Party held a major meeting in March of this year, Stalin himself could have made such a statement in his speech. At that time, Stalin criticized Western European democracies for trying to increase the Soviet Union's hostility towards Germany, poisoning the atmosphere, and inciting the Soviet Union to start a war with Germany without clear justification. In fact, this statement had already been made on May 23, 1914, two months before the outbreak of World War I, when the Imperial Russian Duma convened, expressing distrust of Britain. It was made by Markov, an extremely conservative monarchist deputy. This deputy, a staunch supporter of the Romanov dynasty's autocracy, made a memorable speech at the time, expressing perpetual suspicion about the gifts offered by Russia to Britain. Markov said, "British friendship can only exist when there is no need for active assistance to Russia…If we were to conclude a small alliance with Germany, that would be much better than forming a great friendship with Britain." Today, on the eve of the second world war, which seems about to break out again in twenty-five years, Stalin sees Britain reluctantly extending its hand with the same trepidation as before. The previous time it was extended, the Rasputin (the "mad monk" of Imperial Russia) clique around Tsar Nicholas II was disturbed. This time, the Soviet people cannot avoid becoming suspicious. As for Soviet public opinion regarding its own foreign policy, it is completely in the dark because ten years of Bolshevik revolutionary propaganda have greatly obscured the obvious fact that "the Soviet Union is Russia."

The Soviet Union must now choose a policy. The decision it makes is of great importance. In determining the future of the Soviet Union and the world, it will indeed play a decisive role. This decision rests in the hands of one person, Stalin. It would be a misunderstanding to think that he has completely destroyed the legacy he created when he was a revolutionary Bolshevik. All of his political training was under the guidance of Lenin. In Lenin's mind, Russia was never just a country.

Lenin's theories were largely formulated during his exile abroad, living in humble dwellings in London, Stockholm, Geneva, Munich, Krakow, and Zurich. He was an internationalist, not only because he had read Marx's works, but also because he had spent most of his adult life as a stateless person. He seized power during a period of general social upheaval and wartime and post-war chaos in Europe. He saw that all the countries of the world were coming to an end, and that an international labor dictatorship would be born in response, rising to replace them. With this belief, he personally signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, forfeiting one-third of European Russian territory. Originally, he sincerely believed that as long as the Russian Bolshevik Party could retain power for a short period, by the "red day of judgment," all the boundaries of all the countries in Europe would disappear without a trace. Until the day he died, he did not attend meetings on national power politics.

Stalin, however, was very different from Lenin. Although he was born in Georgia, he was more Russian than Lenin's disciples, who were exiled in Europe in their early years and constantly flitted from one capital to another. Before the Russian Revolution, he rarely lived outside the Empire. After joining the Bolshevik Party, he still lived in various cities and villages in Russia, sometimes in remote parts of Siberia. In his view, the "International Labor System" was nothing more than an abstraction of Lenin's beliefs. His experience came entirely from associating with Russian farmers, workers, and police.

Soon after Lenin's death, Stalin broke with the main tenets of Bolshevism, which required the international movement to achieve its goals. Trotsky and Zinoviev continued to stir up trouble in the international labor movement and the world revolution. Stalin gradually turned his gaze to the Russian Empire, its people, and its unlimited resources. Stalin won.

For twelve years, Stalin has been directing the policies of the Soviet Union with a single finger in the palaces where the Tsars used to govern. In recent years, he has done everything within his power to revive Russian national patriotism. He encouraged people to read the works of famous figures who were previously considered middle-class and restorationist and were banned. Soviet cinemas now show the battle achievements of early Russian princes and tsars, regarding them as national glory. This was absolutely forbidden in Lenin's time. Soviet newspapers have now actively resumed using the phrase "motherland" as a propaganda topic. This phrase was considered the most opposed to revolution and internationalism in the past. He also instructed people that for the sake of Russian territory, it is worthwhile to fight, even sacrificing their lives. Stalin's foreign policy unfolds in this atmosphere. This is also the background that makes his foreign policy understandable. The recent foreign actions of the Soviet Union are all dominated by its own national interests. This can be best evidenced by the newspapers run abroad by Soviet exiles. These newspapers are very unkind to Stalin, and even more disliked by Bolshevik foreign policy. One is the daily newspaper published in Paris by Professor Milyukov, who was foreign minister in the short-lived Russian democratic republic in 1917. The other is the bi-monthly magazine published by Kerensky, who was prime minister in that government. Both publications are supplied with news at any time by authoritative secret visitors living in the Soviet Union. They foresaw that the Soviet Union's foreign policy would change long before the world saw even the slightest hint of it. Milyukov's newspaper pointed out that between the Munich Conference in September 1938 and the occupation of Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, in March of this year, the Soviet Union must have sold a large amount of goods to Germany.

After the Munich Conference, Hitler formulated a plan to establish an autonomous Carpathian Ukraine state in the eastern suburbs of Czechoslovakia and used huge sums to encourage the Ukrainian separatist movement. The Western European powers did not regard this as a major concern, thinking that German troops would soon attack Soviet Ukraine. However, in March, this piece of land was given to Hungary, so Hitler's plan was shelved. The harmonious relationship between Berlin and Moscow greatly unsettled the nerves of Downing Street in London. The Soviet Union has undoubtedly returned to national power politics. The Communist Party is quite perplexed by Stalin's flirting with Germany, but this is a strategic movement aimed at dealing with those who recently attempted to sacrifice the Soviet Union to appease Hitler. Therefore, the essence of this movement is to preserve the Soviet Union as a European power. Russia's experience in dealing with Britain over the past hundred years has made Moscow deal with Britain "with caution in every move." Imperial Russia once saw Britain monopolize advantages in Asia, the Far East, the Bosphorus, and the Balkans to control its enemies.

Only the possibility of Soviet-German amity has forced Great Britain to interact with the Soviet Union on equal terms, or without any conditions, because only this trick can make Britain anxious.

As far as the international communist movement is concerned, Soviet-German understanding is a fatal blow because the propaganda of the Third International has always focused on anti-fascism. But from the standpoint of Soviet national security, this scheme is not without legitimate reasons. Stalin said at the Communist Party Congress, "Our constitution is the most democratic in the world. No one dares to question this fact."

This is indeed close to sincerity on paper. There are very few remedial clauses in the middle, or they have been eliminated, or they still exist. It is appropriate to regard it as a privilege for existing rights and freedoms, but it has a propaganda effect. The creation of this constitution is part of a fervent effort to cultivate patriotism and national conscience to cope with the danger of war. It floats like a ghost over the Kremlin.

The final task of fighting on the side of the Western European democratic countries, and the vague excuse for gaining freedom as a result, is sufficient as a stimulus. That is exactly what the Soviet people need for their suppressed aspirations for political freedom. A Soviet state taking up arms and fighting alongside Britain and France to resist the principles of totalitarian states in 1939, even like the League of Nations in 1914, has already shaken autocracy.

Stalin cannot blindly ignore the demand to clearly join the Western European democratic countries and abandon autocratic Germany. However, the fact that the Soviet Union is on the side of the invaded has created the image of her as a country dedicated to peace, and has repeatedly warned and cared for the country with several plans, and has clearly understood most of world opinion, whether it is correct or wrong, so he cannot make a choice in his decision.

The Soviet Union now enjoys great international prestige, exceeding any era in recent history. Even the most stubborn power-holders cannot lightly abandon this prestige. No matter which path he takes, there are dangers. However, if he colludes with Hitler, the Soviet Union will immediately lose its moral standing in the eyes of the Soviet people and world opinion.

The Soviet Union now, like in 1914, has to decide what to take and what to leave. This decision must go beyond the personal likes and dislikes of her dictator. Stalin, forced by historical turmoil, must replace the monster of world revolution with the interests of the Soviet Union, must pay attention to changes in the situation, and take a tragic and heroic path.

### Portuguese President Returns Home from South Africa

Cape Town: Portuguese President General Carmona has completed his visit to the Union of South Africa and today boarded the "Colonial" ship here to begin his journey. A large crowd gathered at the pier to warmly see him off. A British warship and the shore fired a 21-gun salute. According to reports, General Carmona is the first foreign head of state to set foot on South African territory. The purpose of this trip was to inspect the Portuguese African colonies. After completing the inspection, he came here for a visit. (Reuters, 21st)

### Japanese Troops Reoccupy Shenzhen, British Troops Urgently Move to Border for Alert

Hong Kong Correspondence: Shenzhen, close to Hong Kong Kowloon, was once occupied by Japanese troops last year. After a counterattack by Chinese troops, the Japanese troops withdrew north along the Kowloon-Canton Railway line. On the evening of the 15th of this month, Japanese troops invaded Shenzhen again. On the morning of the 16th, they arrived at the Sino-British border. The British troops stationed in Hong Kong immediately dispatched a company of the Middlesex Regiment and a company of Indian soldiers to guard the border. The situation is recorded as follows:

Japanese Troops Land

On the evening of the 15th, a thousand Japanese troops, with several light artillery pieces and more than ten machine guns, departed from Taiping, Dongguan County, on a Japanese merchant ship and two transport ships. They arrived in the waters off Bin'an County in the evening. At that time, there was a strong storm. The Japanese troops then boarded dozens of speedboats and landed in Chiwan, infiltrating Nantou (i.e., Bao'an County seat). Chinese troops joined forces with the local militia to bravely resist, but due to the disparity in numbers, they retreated to a certain high ground north of the city, and Nantou was lost. On the morning of the 16th, small ferries traveling between Hong Kong and Nantou departed as usual. When they arrived at Shekou, they could not dock and returned to Hong Kong.

Shenzhen Falls

After occupying Nantou, the Japanese troops, with a force of more than five hundred, turned to the highway towards Shenzhen. Among them were a cavalry unit and a bicycle unit. Fearing an ambush by the Chinese along the way, the Japanese troops dispatched four aircraft to provide cover. These Japanese aircraft flew to Shenzhen at around 5 a.m. on the 16th for low-altitude reconnaissance and then flew towards Buji. It was reported that three bombs were dropped in Buji. At around 8 a.m., they returned to Shenzhen and conducted low-altitude strafing. After discovering the vanguard of the Japanese troops, the Chinese militia immediately coordinated with the local police force and calmly fired at the Japanese troops. Later, as the main force of the Japanese troops arrived, they gradually retreated to a certain place, preparing for a counterattack. At this point, Shenzhen fell again. Customs and radio stations received the news, and all staff members safely retreated into British territory and are now gathered in Sheung Shui in the New Territories. A farmer wounded in Shenzhen entered British territory and said that Shenzhen farmers found to have weapons are all slaughtered by the Japanese troops. After the Japanese troops entered Shenzhen City, they began searching house by house. If firearms were found, the able-bodied men in the house were dragged out and executed on the spot. The farmer saw several people carrying rifles surrender to the Japanese troops, but that did not guarantee their lives. The farmer (as he called himself) killed two Japanese soldiers and was then pursued by a Japanese squad and fired upon more than a hundred times. He was finally able to enter British territory. Although he was hit by a bullet in the arm, it was not fatal, and he considered himself fortunate.

British Troops on Alert

After receiving news of the Japanese troops' invasion of Shenzhen, the Hong Kong authorities ordered the local garrison to be on strict alert and dispatched a company of British Middlesex Regiment and a company of Indian Riflemen to the border. Both teams arrived at the border at noon on the 16th. About 50 people were stationed in Lo Wu, and more than 100 were stationed in Man Kam To. The defenses were stricter in Lo Wu because Japanese troops were stationed in the Shenzhen Hotel, facing them from a distance. The crossing was closed with barbed wire. Four British soldiers patrolled with loaded guns, not allowing pedestrians to pass. However, the Man Kam To section was not closed because no Japanese troops had been found, and pedestrians could enter and exit as usual. However, there were many British and Indian soldiers and police. A small portion of the refugees who fled from the Lo Wu military entrance also returned to Chinese territory from that location in the afternoon. The majority flocked to the Sheung Shui and Fanling areas, looking particularly miserable and indignant at the devastation of their hometown and fields.

Refugees Retreat

After the Japanese troops invaded last year, the Shenzhen Hotel was converted into a refugee shelter and temporary hospital. The Red Cross rescue team and the World Red Cross Society both sent personnel to serve there, housing more than a thousand refugees. After receiving news on the morning of the 16th that Japanese troops were infiltrating Shenzhen, the shelter evacuated all the refugees towards British territory. The sick were transported by ambulance, and the refugees moved to Yikeng in Fanling. The sick were transported to Kwong Wah Hospital in Kowloon. According to news from the rescue team, the staff was exceptionally diligent. Those who could not retreat in time due to the suddenness of the event included four rescue team members and more than fifty wounded soldiers. Also, according to reports, the refugees who fled from Bao'an to British territory on the 16th mostly crossed the Shenzhen railway bridge in the morning, but completely disappeared in the afternoon. However, those who fled into the old territory from Man Kam To and Sha Tau Kok were endless throughout the day. A refugee map was presented again between Lo Wu, Sheung Shui, and Fanling, with a tragic situation. The Central Relief Committee immediately sent personnel to Sheung Shui, Fanling, Lo Wu, Cha Keng, and Kam Tin to express condolences and inspect, and immediately handled emergency relief. Often, the refugees in that area, originally located at the old site of the Shenzhen Yau Sang Theatre, were the responsibility of the Hong Kong Red Swastika Society. When the incident occurred, the staff of the society rescued all the men, women, and children and evacuated them to the New Territories. They then asked Tsai Pin-tin, a New Territories Councilor and Vice President of the Red Swastika Society, appointed by the Hong Kong government, to temporarily house all 900-plus refugees in the Cha Keng temporary shelter, while rushing to prepare dry food for relief.

### Rice Prices Drop in Wuxi and Wujin Counties

Wuxi Correspondence: Rice prices in Wuxi and Wujin counties have soared to 20 yuan per stone, making it difficult for ordinary people to obtain food. Recently, because the Wuhu rice in Anhui Province has been decontrolled, various rice merchants have gone to purchase it one after another. Thirty to forty vehicles of newly harvested rice have been transported, and forty more vehicles are scheduled to be transported to Su, Xi, and Wu counties for sale. Rice prices have fallen. High-quality new rice now only costs 15 yuan per stone, and white glutinous rice costs 17.5 yuan. This year, Anhui Province has had timely rainfall, and the autumn harvest is very abundant. The rice is of good quality and color. However, when transporting it to Shanghai, exorbitant taxes are levied, and there are various obstacles, making it difficult to reduce costs. The authorities must make every effort to mediate so that the rice can be transported steadily.

### Shanghai West Incident: Municipal Council Lodges Protest, Responsibility Lies with Puppet Police Based on Evidence, Willing to Arbitrate Disputes Fairly, Japanese Side Also Lodges Protest with Council

Regarding the incident that occurred on Rue de Gascogne on the 19th of this month (Saturday), the Shanghai "Special Municipality" has lodged a protest with the Municipal Council. Yesterday (22nd), in the late evening, the Council sent out its reply. The reply is translated as follows:

Regret Over the Accident

"We regret the occurrence of an accident on Rue de Gascogne on the 19th of this month (Saturday). The letter from the Shanghai Special Municipality regarding the incident, issued on August 21st of this year, has been received by the Council.

Responsibility Lies with the Police Based on Evidence

Regarding the evidence concerning this incident, the Council has carefully reviewed it. Based on all the evidence, the incident should clearly be the responsibility of the police of Your Municipality and cannot be attributed to Patrol Leader Jin Loke, who was leading the Council's police officers at the time. Patrol Leader Jin, in the course of his duties, questioned the police of the Shanghai Special Municipality as to why they were marching in formation with weapons on the Council's roads and what their destination was. While he was questioning them, a member of the police squad of the Shanghai Special Municipality, without reason, became angry and shot and wounded Patrol Leader Jin. The other members of the squad also aimed their weapons at Patrol Leader Jin. Patrol Leader Jin then loaded bullets into his pistol and, for self-defense, fired his weapon in an attempt to disperse the police who were aiming their weapons at him.

Protest Against This Action Should Be Lodged

The Council not only believes that it is not responsible for this unfortunate incident but also believes that a protest should be lodged with Your Municipality regarding the actions of the police of the Shanghai Special Municipality. To maintain law and order, Your Municipality clearly needs to take measures to prevent the same situation from occurring on the Council's roads in the future. It is legal for the personnel of the Council's Police Department to patrol the Council's roads.

Willing to Submit Any Disputes to Arbitration

Based on the evidence obtained from the investigation, the Council firmly believes that the above conclusion is entirely based on facts. If the Shanghai Special Municipality disputes any of the facts ascertained by the Council, the Council is willing to submit the incident to individuals agreed upon by both parties for a fair investigation.

Japanese Consul Also Lodges Protest

Regarding the above incident, the Japanese Consul General has also lodged a protest, which was delivered to the Municipal Council yesterday. The Council has informed the Japanese Consul General of the gist of the reply to the Shanghai Special Municipality and has expressed to the Consul General its willingness to present all the evidence for a fair investigation.

The Council Does Not Recognize the Puppet Regime

The Continental Daily News reports that the Municipal Council has decided to submit a written protest regarding the shooting incident in which Probationary Western Patrol Leader Jin Loke was shot and wounded by armed "Great Road" police on Rue de Gascogne. The nature of this diplomatic procedure by the Council is to protest the letter sent to the Council by Chu Minyi, the "Mayor" of the city under Japanese patronage. It was heard last night that the Council's reply will be sent directly to Mr. Chu. Previously, the Municipal Council had no formal interactions with Mr. Chu. However, according to news received last night, this reply to the puppet "Mayor" will not constitute formal recognition of the municipal authority. "Mayor" Chu visited Franklin, Chairman of the Municipal Council, yesterday. The Municipal Council received Mr. Chu's note before evening. At the same time, it was seen that large reinforcements of Japanese troops outside the Zhao Feng Garden British Defense Zone were patrolling back and forth on the railway controlled by the former group, traveling by truck. The shooting incident was still under investigation yesterday. The Police Department and the "Great Road" side both claim that the other side fired first. The Police Department's firearms expert will determine today (22nd) the firearm from which the bullets fired by the "Great Road" personnel came. Western Patrol Leader Jin Loke is in the Hong Si Hospital, and his injuries have improved well yesterday. Mr. Jin has received many praises for his courageous response.

Japanese Side Uses Excuse to Refuse to Return Authority

According to Japanese sources last night, Consul General Miura sent a letter to Council Chairman Franklin on [date] informing him that the Japanese side had been actively working to restore the Municipal Council's police authority north of the Suzhou Creek. However, because of the unlawful killing of a "Municipal" police officer by a Council police officer, the Japanese side deeply feels that the Municipal Council poses a great danger to maintaining law and order. Therefore, the return of police authority north of the Suzhou Creek has been postponed.

"Reformed Government" Attempts to Recapture Concessions

According to Japanese sources from Nanjing, the "Reformed Government" Ministry of Foreign Affairs has drafted a plan to recover the Shanghai International Settlement as a fundamental solution to the issue of the International Settlement and foreign concessions in China. This move was decided upon because of the shooting incident in Shanghai on the 19th of this month, which involved Jin Loke, a Western patrol leader of the International Settlement, and several police officers of the "Shanghai Municipal Government" under Japanese patronage. This plan will be submitted to the "Reformed Government Executive Yuan for approval.

### Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes: Great Expectations from All Sectors; Many Visited the Central Bank Last Month to Exchange Notes; Postponement of Issuance Purely Due to Unfinished Procedures

Following the order of the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank commissioned the American firm, Yong Ning Company, to print one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes. The initial batch of 500,000 yuan was originally scheduled for issuance yesterday. However, due to temporary printing issues, it was decided to postpone the issuance. A public announcement will be made once the printing is completed. As for the handling of postage stamps after the issuance of the fractional currency notes, the Postal Administration has already inquired with the Kunming General Administration yesterday. Details are as follows:

Reason for Postponement: Printing Issues

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday from the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank that the first batch of 500,000 yuan of fractional currency notes, including 300,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan in five-cent notes, was commissioned to be printed by the American firm, Yong Ning Company. According to the contract, the goods were to be delivered within 20 days from the date of signing. It was originally scheduled for issuance starting yesterday (i.e., the 22nd). However, due to the fact that the fractional currency notes were not printed as scheduled, the issuance date had to be postponed. A public announcement will be made once the printing is completed and delivered to the bank. Furthermore, a responsible person from the bank firmly stated that the rumors circulating that the issuance would take place on the 23rd were not true.

Thousands Gathered to Exchange Notes Yesterday

People from various industries in this city were delighted to hear that the bank's new fractional currency was officially to be issued at the Shanghai branch starting yesterday morning. Based on reports in yesterday's newspapers, each person would be allowed to exchange up to one yuan. As a result, without prior arrangement, citizens from both settlements carried legal tender worth one yuan each and gathered outside the bank's door on Albert Road, Yiyuan, at dawn yesterday (around 6:00 AM). By nearly 8:00 AM, the road outside the bank's door was blocked, with a crowd of five to six thousand people wanting to exchange notes. Upon receiving the news, the general police station of the French Concession, Lujiawan, dispatched a large number of detectives to maintain order. Subsequently, the bank posted a notice stating that the issuance of fractional currency notes had been temporarily suspended due to incomplete procedures. Only then did the people seeking to exchange notes disperse. Fortunately, no incidents occurred. It was heard that some people came from afar to exchange notes yesterday. Unable to exchange fractional currency notes, they changed to new subsidiary currency notes of one or two dimes. Various responsible persons from the bank stated that the bank's internal procedures had not been completed and that the issuance date would have to be determined by instructions from the head office. No mention was made of the counterfeit notes found on the market.

Tobacco Exchange Notice: Refusal to Accept Counterfeit Notes

Mr. Shen Weiting, chairman of the Tobacco Exchange Association, recently sent a letter to the Central Bank requesting permission to receive the new notes, but has not yet received a reply. He went to the bank at 8:00 AM yesterday to meet with the person in charge and inquire about the situation. He was told that the issuance of the notes would be postponed and that there would be no problem with various industries receiving the notes in the future. However, according to reliable reports, counterfeit notes had already been found circulating on the market. The bank will promptly develop necessary measures. For now, it is hoped that various industries will refuse to use the counterfeit notes before the bank's new notes are issued. After the meeting, Mr. Shen immediately returned to the association and ordered the section to issue a temporary notice, which read: "Regarding the issuance of fractional currency notes by the Central Bank, this association has sent a letter to the bank for collection. Before these fractional currency notes are received, members are requested not to accept or use them temporarily. This is a notice."

No Decision Yet on Minting Aluminum Coins

In order to facilitate the usage, the Central Bank previously planned to issue one-cent and five-cent aluminum coins. After research by the bank and the Ministry of Finance, it was found that the cost of an aluminum one-cent coin would be more than one cent, not including the minting costs. Therefore, after minting, issuance, and circulation, there was great concern that unscrupulous merchants would buy and melt them. Therefore, the plan to mint aluminum coins has not yet been decided. It is believed that issuing fractional currency notes is the most appropriate method. No decision has been made on when the second batch of fractional currency notes will be printed.

### Pay Raise for Postal Workers Settled

Employees of the Shanghai Postal Administration, finding living difficult due to high prices, previously requested a pay raise from the authorities. It is now known that the temporary measures set by the postal authorities began in July. Those with monthly salaries below 150 yuan received a uniform increase of 7.50 yuan. In the current month, it has been changed to a uniform raise of 7.50 yuan for all those with monthly salaries below 190 yuan. This pay raise will increase the post office's monthly expenses by 25,000 yuan. It is heard that post office gatekeepers have also requested a similar raise, but the postal authorities believe that since they are not postal workers, the request for a pay raise can only be made to the police department. However, it has not been completely rejected, and the general affairs section of the post office is currently considering the matter. Regarding the issue of refusing to hire married female employees, the postal savings and remittance bureau and the Jianghai Customs have already implemented it. The Shanghai Postal Administration, however, has not considered this matter. It is heard that the Shanghai Administration, including female postal workers and postal assistants who were withdrawn from Nanjing to Shanghai, totals seventy to eighty people. Their treatment is the same as that of male employees, except that their vacation time is slightly longer. Their hiring began ten years ago.

### Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Compete to Purchase Scrap Metal to Offer to the Motherland; Competing with a Certain Party at the Same Price; Losses Compensated by Donations from Overseas Chinese

Since the outbreak of the war of resistance in the motherland, overseas Chinese in the Philippines have been most enthusiastic about donating funds, offering gold, and purchasing national salvation public bonds, ranking first among overseas Chinese in various regions. Now, the overseas Chinese in the Philippines, seeing that a certain party is searching for old iron to replenish military supplies and gradually extending to the Philippines, have initiated a movement to compete to purchase scrap metal to donate to the motherland as a way to resist this. At present, anti-Japanese associations in Xili Province and other places in the Philippines have established organizations for this purpose, competing with a certain party at the same price. The losses are compensated by donations from overseas Chinese. The situation is very enthusiastic.

### Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association Requests Price Controls on Flour; Vagrants in the Western District Attempt to Rob Rice Without Success; It is Heard that Rice Transported to the Huangpu River Has Been Detained

The Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Regarding the skyrocketing price of flour, we request that you forward the request for price controls to the authorities. Flour is the primary element in supplementing the people's food supply. With the price of rice skyrocketing on the black market to over 30 yuan and the price of flour soaring to 6.20 yuan per bag, the price of food for the people has reached an extreme. The poor cannot make a living. Noodles are a blessing for the working class. If the price increases again, the poor will have no way to make a living. We earnestly request that your chamber approve and immediately forward the request to the authorities that price controls should be imposed on flour. This would be a great benefit. Representatives of the Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association, Chu Shaokun and Wang Jinwen, jointly."

Advising Rice Merchants Not to Hoard

The Municipal High Council sent a letter to the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Shop Industry Association, stating, "In reply to your previous letter regarding the relief of rice shortages, we are fully aware. Currently, the stock of rice is lacking. The key to relief is to dredge the sources. We have discussed the matter with the Public Concession Works Department to make proper arrangements as soon as possible. Your association should also do its best to negotiate with the Works Department to handle the matter carefully in order to take care of the people's food supply. It is most important to advise members not to hoard rice and secretly sell it in order to achieve their own profit."

Chamber of Commerce Asks to Dredge Sources

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Concession Works Department yesterday, stating, "The price of rice in this city is high, reaching the highest record since the opening of the port. The general residents and commercial employees feel extremely uneasy. Over the past two years, the area under your administration has gradually returned to its original state, and new small-scale industries have also shown signs of recovery. If the rice price crisis causes unrest in all sectors, then the efforts of the Goods Bureau over the past two years will be in vain. The key to this matter need not be elaborated upon by this chamber. Last year's autumn harvest was considered good. The current situation must be due to obstructed sources. If the issue of dredging the sources can be addressed, then the supply of rice will surge, and prices will naturally fall. It is hoped that your bureau will use its authority to break through this difficult situation so that the trend of rice shortages and market shutdowns can be alleviated, and the price of rice will gradually fall, which would be fortunate for both Chinese and foreign citizens. We urge you to strictly investigate and order the sale of rice at fair prices for those who hoard and raise prices in order to prevent the results of dredging rice sources from being exploited by such individuals."

Rice Merchants in the Western District Temporarily Suspend Door-to-Door Sales

At 7:30 PM the night before last, dozens of poorly dressed male and female poor people suddenly came to a rice shop in Xujiahui to buy rice. In the chaos, the poor people took the opportunity to enter and carry out a robbery. Fortunately, the shop clerk was alert and reported to the nearby police station, who came to the scene to suppress the incident, preventing it from happening. As a result, starting yesterday, Yang Baokang, Yisheng, Yida, Shenji in the old street of Xujiahui Town, Maoshun, Yuanyuan in Tongren Street, and Quansheng, Gonghe, Wanxing, Shundetai, Wanshun, Chengda, Yongheng, Daxing, Xinji, and Santai, Cihongshun, and other rice shops, had no rice for sale. Even if there was a small amount of rice in stock, they were afraid of accidents during sales and temporarily suspended door-to-door sales.

Rice Transported to Shanghai Intercepted in the Huangpu River

According to news from the Miscellaneous Grains Industry, a large quantity of rice, more than 10,000 bags, was purchased and loaded onto the Japanese merchant ship Lun Xijiu Maru for convenience in order to sell it at a good price in Shanghai. However, it was intercepted by the Japanese naval authorities in the Huangpu River, and a satisfactory arrangement has not yet been reached.

### Borrowing Rice Issues: Attempt to Take Over the Court; The Puppet "Municipal Government" Sends Letters to the Consular Corps and the Public Concession Bureau Again; Hoping for an Early Reply on This Matter

The Zi Lin Bao reports, "'Mayor' Fu Xiao'an sent a letter to the Consular Corps and the Public Concession Bureau yesterday (the 21st), urging cooperation with the 'Shanghai Municipal Government' in order to prohibit wartime merchants from manipulating rice. The letter stated that the most effective way to curb the activities of merchants is to transfer the jurisdiction of the First and Second Special District Courts to the 'Great Way' authorities, which will severely punish the merchants. Regarding the matter of the court, he has repeatedly negotiated with the Consular Corps and the Public Concession Bureau, but has not yet received a reply or expressed an opinion, which is regrettable. Please give the most serious consideration to this issue and reply as soon as possible."

### Efforts to Rescue Four Chinese in Tianjin: Continuing Efforts; British Lawyers Appeal Directly to the Full Court to Issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus

The Shanghai Times reports that Mr. Jones, from the British law firm of Ellis & Hays, told reporters yesterday (the 20th) that there will be important developments today (the 22nd) regarding the case of the writ of habeas corpus for the four persons detained in Tianjin. The result of the petition submitted last week by Aird & Birbeck (the legal representatives of Ellis & Hays in England) is that it has been decided to apply to the court in London today for a writ of habeas corpus. It is understood that Ellis & Hays has already applied for a writ of habeas corpus in Shanghai regarding the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin, but it was rejected by Magistrate Jones. However, Jones and Leeks, representing Ellis & Hays, are prepared to appeal directly to the Full Court to issue a writ of habeas corpus if the petition by the London representatives fails today. In this case, Magistrate Moss will convene an appeal court. This court may be composed of only two magistrates, namely Magistrate Jones and Moss himself, or it may be composed of three magistrates. The third magistrate may be the clerk Haynes or someone else well-versed in the law appointed by Magistrate Moss. British law recognizes the importance of personal freedom and should allow applications to be made to any number of magistrates. Therefore, if the petition by Aird & Birbeck fails today, Jones will first appeal to Magistrate Moss, and Magistrate Moss will hear the case alone. At the same time, Jones stated that he is currently waiting for letters from the four Chinese detainees in Tianjin authorizing him to represent them in this legal matter. When Magistrate Jones rejected the petition for the writ at the British Consulate General here, he stated that the petition for a writ of habeas corpus must be made by the prisoner and supported by an affidavit authorizing someone to act as their representative. This affidavit is expected to arrive immediately. The merits of this petition will be debated in the London Court Office today, and then a decision will be made as to whether a writ should be issued. Judge Cassel may be listening. Action will be taken here only after the decision made in London is known.

### The Isolated Army Incident in Shanghai: Previously Agreed to by the Japanese; Food and Expenses to Be Borne by the Chinese Government; Japanese Accuse Ignorance of the Intended Purpose

The Zi Lin Bao reports that a reporter inquired with officials yesterday (the 21st) about the Isolated Army incident. It was stated that on November 1, 1937, the day after the Isolated Army was detained by the Public Concession Bureau, the Bureau sent identical letters to the Consular Corps and the Japanese Consulate, informing them of the Bureau's decision to detain these soldiers and that the Chinese government would bear the cost of their upkeep until the end of the Sino-Japanese War. In a surprisingly short period of time, a reply was received notifying the Public Concession Bureau that they fully agreed to the detention. In this regard, the Japanese Consul General, as a member of the Consular Corps, not only replied on behalf of his own consulate, but also did not object to the Consular Corps' reply to the Public Concession Bureau. It is noted that taxpaying Japanese have recently accused the Public Concession Bureau of assisting in the maintenance of the Isolated Army, threatening them with non-payment of taxes. Regarding this point, officials also stated that the Chinese government is fully responsible for all expenses.

### Automatic Subsidies in the North-South Groceries Industry: Stabilizing the Lives of Employees; Increasing Efficiency

Since the sudden devaluation of the black market exchange rate, the prices of all goods have soared, especially oil, rice, and food. The general salaried class has been hit the hardest and is constantly complaining. Therefore, there have been requests for pay raises to seek relief. Understanding employers, in order to stabilize the lives of their employees, are mostly happy to accept. Some have also voluntarily provided subsidies without waiting for requests from the labor side. The following is a record of what has been seen and heard, as a reference for various industries:

Xin Yuan Feng Incense Shop

The owner of the Xin Yuan Feng Incense Shop on East Xin Bridge, Avenue Edward VII, recognizing that the price of rice has soared and the lives of all employees are difficult, has decided that starting from August, regardless of rank, each person will receive a rice subsidy of 5 yuan per month in addition to their original salary. Apprentices will continue to receive an additional subsidy of one yuan until the price of rice returns to normal.

North Goods Industry Association

Qiu Yangzhi, chairman of the Shanghai North Goods Industry Association, Zheng Changgeng, and Lu Wenbin, members of the Standing Committee, recognizing the difficult lives of the association's employees, have voluntarily increased their salaries by 20% starting this month to stabilize their lives and increase their efficiency in handling matters. This move sets an example for others and deserves attention.

Sugar and Sea United Market

The salaries of all employees of the Shanghai North-South Groceries Industry United Market on Tongyun Street, Xiaodongmen, will also be subsidized appropriately starting this month to maintain the status quo.

### Sand and Gravel Detained in Wusong: Have Been Transported to Shanghai Through Circuitous Routes; Panic in the Construction Industry Has Been Roughly Resolved; But the Soaring Prices of Materials Make Construction Extremely Difficult

More than 30 sand transport ships in this city, loaded with yellow sand and gravel from the islands of Si Jiao and Sheng Shan, were transported to Shanghai for sale. However, when they passed through Wusong, they were forcibly detained by steamships sent by the puppet "Jiangnan Sand and Gravel Company," forcing them to dock in the Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang area, resulting in the interruption of the source of sand and gravel in the Shanghai concession, soaring market prices, and the construction industry being severely affected. It is now known that various gangs, due to the urgent need for sand in Shanghai, transported the sand to Shanghai through circuitous routes at night to supply the needs of various construction industries. Currently, with the gradual increase in the supply of sand and gravel, market prices have also fallen slightly, and the panic in the construction industry regarding sand and gravel has been roughly resolved.

Contract Quotations Have Been Affected

The Shanghai Construction Industry Association has stated that with the recent devaluation of foreign exchange rates and the soaring prices of building materials, the prices for contracted house construction previously agreed upon are now twice as high compared to the current prices of materials, making it impossible to fulfill the contracts. Yesterday, a public announcement was made to various industry leaders to request ways to remedy the situation. The original text read: "We hereby inform you that members of our association have reported that recently, foreign exchange rates have plummeted, prices of all goods have skyrocketed, and financial panic has reached its peak, which can be described as an unprecedented catastrophe. Most of the raw materials required by our industry come from overseas, and the impact has been greater than in other industries. Even domestic raw materials, in addition to being affected by foreign exchange rates, have also doubled in price due to special circumstances. Labor costs will also increase in the near future. Withdrawals from banks are limited by the restrictions set by the Ministry of Finance code, and the contraction has reached its extreme.

Unable to Stop and Unable to Advance

My colleagues and others calculate all contracted projects based on the financial situation and the price of goods at that time. This sudden and extraordinary change makes it impossible to stop and unable to advance. We are anxious and frightened. Therefore, we have no choice but to appeal to the public officials of the association to find ways to remedy the situation, study the matter carefully, and find a solution that takes into account both legal and emotional considerations and benefits both the public and private sectors, so that our colleagues can have something to follow, which would be a blessing for the industry and a blessing for society, etc. After reviewing the above-mentioned claims of the members, the situation is indeed real. This financial crisis cannot be attributed to any party and is actually an unavoidable event.

Hoping That Owners Will Understand

The only solution is to hope that the owners can understand the special circumstances of the environment, understand the hardships of their colleagues, take into account the facts, and find an appropriate solution so that there is no conflict with both law and emotion, and that both the public and private sectors can get their due. Although our association is an industry association, we are concerned about the general financial security, so we dare not be presumptuous and express the real situation and appeal to the owners on behalf of our colleagues, and we dare to hope for understanding."

Construction Bamboo and Wood Are Still Prohibited Items

The Zhejiang Provincial Government approved Commander Gu's telegram on behalf of the Military Commission, citing a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, stating that although bamboo was originally designated as a prohibited item, the Executive Yuan later revised the original method, and bamboo and wood were only restricted to those suitable for construction. Those not suitable for construction will be released. Informing subordinates to take note, etc. The provincial government has transferred and instructed all counties and relevant agencies to take note.

### Robbing Vegetables Transported to Shanghai at the Intersection of Hongqiao Road and Zhongshan Road; Forcibly Dragging Vegetable Vendors Onto Cars and Escorting Them to Hongkou for Sale; Vegetables from Pudong Have Been Controlled by the Hongkou Market

Regarding the abandonment of the Japanese attempt to control vegetables from Pudong due to concerns, incidents of Japanese intercepting vegetable vendors and transporting them to Hongkou have reoccurred at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai. Since the 20th of this month, four or five Japanese people have been standing guard at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Zhongshan Road from 4-5 am to 7-8 am and from 2 pm to 6 pm. Next to them is a truck. Whenever they see a vegetable vendor entering the concession from China, they forcibly take the vegetables and fruits they are carrying and load them into the truck, and

Four Vegetable Vendors

(limited to four people) are forcibly dragged into the car and whisked into Hongkou. One thing worth noting is that the Japanese soldiers stationed there do not interfere and even inform the vegetable vendors to seek other routes. As for the vegetable vendors who accompany the trucks into Hongkou, it is not yet known what they get for their wares and where they are taken. Inquiries with people in the ground cargo industry reveal that this has indeed been witnessed and is expected to be

unknown to the Japanese Military

authorities, similar to the recent incident of controlling vegetables in Pudong. It is also understood that around the Baziqiao area of ​​Zhabei Dachang, the Japanese sent 3,000 Taiwanese migrants last spring to occupy the homes of the people in the area to plant fruits and vegetables. The yield is very abundant, but it is exclusively for the needs of the Japanese troops and various units. If there is a surplus, they are sent to the Hongkou market for sale. Chinese people who want to return home to manage their old businesses are charged rent by the Taiwanese.

Cuckoo Occupies Magpie's Nest

It is also reported that Pudong has begun to force vegetable vendors to transport their vegetable loads to the Hongkou market, transfer them to concession vegetable vendors, and collect commissions from them. Another method is to weigh the vegetable loads passing through the Hongkou market and extract donations, but they are still allowed to sell in the concession.

### Collecting Tolls in the Hongqiao District; Japanese Soldiers Stop Cars Yesterday; Demanding Five Dimes per Car

The English Da Mei Evening News reports that this morning (the 22nd), drivers of cars in the Hongqiao district were surprised to see two Japanese soldiers at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Warren Road stopping cars and asking for five dimes per car. The day before yesterday, "Great Way" police officers were stationed in the area, but they were asking for one yuan per car. This fact is a mystery, as these roads are owned and maintained by the Public Concession Bureau. Now they are asking for "road repair fees." The Public Concession Bureau and the consular authorities are

studying this matter

and have taken no action. From last night until 9:00 am this morning, no tax collectors were seen by those surprised drivers passing through the area. They seem to go to "work" whenever they want. According to someone living in the Hongqiao district, the tax collectors earned no more than twenty yuan yesterday, because they did not try to stop all passing cars. This morning, a Japanese tax collector was asked why he only collected five dimes instead of one yuan. He replied that someone in Shanghai had strongly protested the collection of this tax, saying that the road belonged to the Public Concession Bureau. The Japanese felt it was inappropriate to collect one yuan, so today

only half the amount is collected

and the other half is left for the Public Concession Bureau to collect. According to the Zi Lin Bao, a British expatriate was driving along Warren Road near Hongqiao Road not long after noon yesterday (the 21st). Because he refused to pay the "fee" of one yuan, he was threatened by a "Great Way" policeman with a box cannon. The British expatriate knew that if he did not pay the "fee" and continued to drive west, he would risk his life, so he drove back to the Public Concession. According to the British expatriate, there were

three "Great Way" police officers

stationed at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Warren Road, stopping cars going west. As soon as the car stopped, a person in plain clothes handed the driver a printed English notice stating that starting from noon yesterday, cars passing by must pay a "fee" of one yuan. The money collected will be used for road repairs. Others who drove by were also stopped and, after paying the amount demanded, received a receipt allowing them to continue driving without being harassed. The receipt is valid for one day and can be used to

drive arbitrarily

any number of times on that day without having to pay again. Yesterday, an official from the Public Concession Bureau, in answering an inquiry about the matter, said that the two roads are outside the boundary and are now occasionally repaired by the Works Department of the Public Concession Bureau. He went to the two roads yesterday evening and saw that the road surface was in excellent condition.

It is not the first time

that the "Great Way" authorities have attempted to collect "fees" from those who use the roads built and maintained by the Public Concession Bureau. However, on several previous occasions, the "Great Way" authorities have stopped their attempts when the Public Concession Bureau has taken action. It was the first time yesterday that a foreign expatriate was actually threatened with a gun by a "Great Way" policeman. Since the Japanese army occupied the Hongqiao district, the police station has not exercised its duties in the area.

### Circulating Stamps: Post Office Decides on Measures; Slightly Damaged Stamps May Be Accepted for Use; No Consideration Will Be Given to Recall

Since the news was released that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank would issue 1-cent, 5-cent, and fraction-of-a-cent banknotes starting from the 23rd, the use of stamps in the market was thought to be coming to an end. Yesterday, it was learned that the issuance of these fractional banknotes has been postponed, and stamps will continue to be used as usual. Regarding the already circulating stamps, the postal bureau has specific measures for their handling. The details are as follows:

Post Office Decisions on Stamp Disposal

Although the post office has received letters of recommendation from various organizations in this city, it places greater emphasis on the three recommendations from the Chamber of Commerce. After deliberation and decision by Mr. Tharpelin, the Shanghai Postmaster, the post office will accept and implement one point: that slightly damaged stamps, within a possible range, will be accepted for use and no penalties will be imposed. However, regarding the issue of recall, it was stated that there would be no consideration whatsoever. Mr. Tharpelin has officially replied to the Chamber of Commerce regarding the above decision. Furthermore, according to the person in charge of the bureau, the post office has no intention of submitting further requests to the Directorate General of Posts, as it is unnecessary.

Chamber of Commerce to Request Government Recall

According to news from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber has received a formal reply from the Shanghai Postal Administration regarding the three recommendations it made to the postal bureau. The Chamber believes that the inability of the post office to recall damaged stamps held by peddlers is of great concern to the livelihoods of the poor. Therefore, it will continue to make requests to government agencies. However, the target and method of the request will be decided by the committee.

Commoners and Peddlers Petition Yesterday Morning

Regarding the stamp issue in this city, no definitive solution has been reached. The commercial community, on the one hand, believes that the Central Bank is about to issue fractional banknotes. On the other hand, cigarette and exchange shops and residents returned much of their collection of one-cent copper coins yesterday. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, thirty to forty commoners and peddlers gathered in front of the Directorate General of Posts, claiming that they demanded to be received by the authorities in order to exchange stamps for cash. Fortunately, after gentle persuasion by the postal authorities and the dispatch of detectives by the police, no incidents occurred, and they dispersed.

H.P. Krogh, the Danish head of the business department of the Great Northern Telegraph Company on Avenue Edward VII and captain of Company A of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps, was suddenly shot dead by two thugs in Western suits on the morning of last Friday (the 18th) at around 8:20 AM as he drove his car out of the carport at his residence on Anhe Temple Road. The Public Security Bureau of the Public Concession is closely monitoring this matter but remains silent. They have only requested ballistics experts to conduct a thorough analysis of the two bullets. It is heard that the authorities have made some discoveries, and it is generally believed that a definite conclusion may have been reached. Mr. Krogh's wife and one-year-old son were vacationing in Beidaihe. After hearing the bad news, they took a special trip back to Shanghai on Jardine Matheson's ship "Taishan" and arrived here yesterday afternoon. However, Mr. Krogh's funeral was completed the day before yesterday (the 21st) at 4:30 PM, presided over by the International Settlement Volunteer Corps. It is heard that the cremation ceremony for Mr. Krogh's remains is scheduled for 5:30 PM this afternoon at the Western Cemetery on Jing'an Temple Road. In addition to his wife presiding over the ceremony, all members of Company A of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps and other officers will participate. Mr. Krogh was 39 years old and was born in Jutland, Denmark, in 1900. He was transferred to Shanghai by the headquarters of the Great Northern Telegraph Company in 1928. His wife is British. Mr. Krogh was a member of the Shanghai Club and the French Chamber of Commerce.

### Adulterous Monk; Woman Absconds with Money and is Arrested; Tearfully Confesses to Being Deceived by Lascivious Monk; Public Prosecution for Embezzlement of 10,000 Yuan Will Be Filed Separately

Yang Yunwu, a native of Gaoyou who once served as a county magistrate during the warlord era, is 50 years old. Because he accumulated hundreds of thousands of yuan during his time in office, he extensively acquired concubines and lived as a rentier in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, Yang moved his family to No. 9 Shengde Lane on Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, neighboring the Leshan Temple. Yang has a concubine named Sun Lanzhen, 35 years old this year, also a native of Gaoyou, who has been married to Yang for 16 years. Because she has lost her beauty and favor, the monk Wanyuan of Leshan Temple, because he and Sun Lanzhen

Saw Each Other Morning and Night

Did not disdain her as a broken branch or remaining leaf. The two unexpectedly formed an inseparable bond. This spring, Yang again moved his family to No. 3, Lane 44, Rue Raoul-Follereau. Sun Lanzhen and the monk Wanyuan still frequently visited each other, but feeling inconvenienced, on the tenth day of the fourth lunar month, Sun Lanzhen took more than 6,000 yuan in cash and gold jewelry and fled without a trace. After his concubine fled, Yang reported it to the French Concession police for investigation. Last month, Wang Changchun, a detective of the French police, arrested the monk Wanyuan and confiscated embroidered pillowcases and other stolen goods. He was sent to the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court and has already been tried and sentenced to

Six Months Imprisonment

Sun Lanzhen had been hiding at No. 2, Lane 2, Roberts Road, until she was arrested by the French Concession police the day before yesterday. Yesterday, she was brought to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, requesting detention for investigation. Judge Qiu Huanying took the bench to interrogate her. The defendant, Sun Lanzhen, stood before the court in tears, claiming to be 35 years old, from Gaoyou, and that her husband, Yang Yunwu, was a government official. She has been in the Yang family for 16 years, and the relationship between husband and concubine has always been good. This was because of the move to Leshan Temple due to the war, neighboring the old monk. Because of a moment of confusion, she had an infamous affair with the monk Wanyuan of Leshan Temple. Later,

Wanyuan Incited

Her to run away, so she took 2,500 yuan in cash, three jade bracelets, six gold rings, and several leather suitcases. She first stayed with Monk Wanyuan at the Baxian Hotel. After five days, they went to Hangzhou Temple to stay for ten days, then returned to Shanghai and stayed at the Oriental Hotel. The gold bracelets and gold rings were all taken by Wanyuan. As for the 2,500 yuan in cash, 2,000 yuan was taken by Wanyuan, supposedly to lend to his master, Monk Qinliang, to mortgage the Leshan Temple property. Unexpectedly, Monk Wanyuan has already been arrested and imprisoned, causing me to have

Nowhere to Live

I was completely deceived by the old monk. At this point, Sun Lanzhen pulled her own daughter and cried bitterly, asking for mother and daughter reunion. Yang Yunwu also requested leniency from the court. Judge Qiu reviewed the testimony and ordered that the defendant, Sun Lanzhen, be detained and re-examined on the 29th of this month. As for the monk Wanyuan, the French police will file additional charges of instigating theft.

### Chen Maochang of Shaodian Was Chopped Six Times with an Ax

Chen Maochang, 30 years old, from Shaodian, lived at No. 557 Xinzha Road. At around 7 PM last night, Chen was walking past the entrance of the Quan'an Teahouse on Xinzha Bridge Road when suddenly a dozen people swarmed forward and stopped him. One of them pulled out a sharp ax and, without asking any questions, chopped him six times: twice on the back, twice on the left thigh, and twice on the right calf. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Afterwards, Chinese constable No. 1651 stepped forward and arrested one of the perpetrators. An ambulance was called to take Chen to Shilong Hospital for treatment.

### A Careless Fire at a Tung Oil Factory on Jessfield Road Spreads to More Than Ten Neighboring Factories

A careless fire suddenly broke out at the Fuxing Tung Oil Factory at No. 1486, Lane Jessfield Road. Because tung oil is extremely flammable, it quickly became uncontrollable. After vigorous firefighting efforts, it was extinguished after two hours. As a result, in addition to the complete destruction of the factory, the fire spread to as many as sixteen or seventeen neighboring factory buildings. Even two flower sheds at the back door of the Zhaofeng Huakai in front of the factory were affected.

### Apprentice Falsely Reports Robbery; Arrested After Exposure

It was reported that Yongheng Money Exchange at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Shandong Road sent an apprentice to deliver funds at around 10 AM yesterday. A total of more than 2,800 yuan was wrapped in cloth and carried out. Unexpectedly, it had already been coveted by bandits waiting outside the door. As soon as the person came out, one bandit wearing a suit and holding a pistol and another bandit wearing short clothes grabbed him, ordered him to keep quiet, and forced him to get into a car parked on the side of the road, speeding south and turning into the French Concession. When the car reached Rue de Consulat, the bandit with the gun took out a handkerchief and blindfolded the man, pushing him out of the car. The bandits drove away in the original car. The victim could not recall the car number or any other details. He immediately reported the incident to the French police, who transferred it to the Public Concession police for investigation. However, after investigation, it was learned that the case was purely fabricated by the apprentice, who had intentionally made a false report. The apprentice has been detained and will be sent to court for prosecution.

### Resolution of Dispute Over Dumping Excrement

The disposal of garbage in the entire French Concession had been delayed due to threats from the puppet authorities to increase subsidies, requiring 80,000 yuan per year. Before the war, all garbage in the French Concession was transported by barge to Punan and Xinlonghua for disposal, with the contractor subsidizing the former municipal authorities 20,000 yuan per year for sanitation fees. It is now learned that the negotiations between the two parties have been resolved and a contract has been signed. The annual subsidy to the puppet authorities is still written as 80,000 yuan in legal tender, but in reality, it only costs 60,000 yuan. Garbage dumping has resumed to its original state since noon on the 22nd.

In addition, the excrement from the two concessions was also innocently obstructed due to the Japanese puppet authorities' prohibition of garbage dumping, claiming it to be related to sanitation. All ships from farmers in the suburbs coming to Shanghai to purchase excrement fertilizer were cut off, causing a stench and chaos. Fortunately, the excrement contractor managed to sell it at the manure factory. Now that the garbage dumping subsidy issue has been signed and resolved, restoring the original state, farmers in the four surrounding villages can also freely come to Shanghai to purchase artificial fertilizer. However, the excrement contractor secretly suffered considerable losses.

### Fire at North Railway Station Warehouse; Japanese Claim Arson Again

Afterwards, the Japanese claimed that the fire must have been caused by arsonists and strictly prohibited all coolies from entering or leaving, questioning them one by one. However, there were no clues, so the investigation is still ongoing.

### Owner of Sanguantang Excrement Wharf Shot Yesterday; Yao Xinwei Shot in the Waist

Wang Ronggen, an 18-year-old from Tongzhou, residing at No. 216 Gansu Road, worked at Yihua Packing Factory. Recently, he associated with bad friends, whoring and gambling, squandering money. Between July 28th and the 19th of this month, he stole 180 yuan in legal tender and a bicycle worth 85 yuan from his mother, Wang Yan's, home, pawning them for cash. When she discovered this, she twisted her son Wang Ronggen over to the Chinese constable on duty, who took him to the Huishi police station and detained him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted him for theft, stating that the defendant's father, Wang Shichang, had been sentenced to eight months in prison for carrying military firepower and was serving his sentence, and that the defendant was Wang Yan's adopted son, not her biological son. Judge Huang interrogated Wang Ronggen briefly and ordered him to be detained and the case re-examined at a later date.

Xue A'ren (also known as Wenlong), the owner of the Yilun Silk Factory in Butterfly Bridge, Wuxi, was kidnapped by bandits in the factory on March 25th of this year. Because no one negotiated a ransom, he was bound with hemp rope and shot dead by the bandits next to a tomb in the wilderness on the afternoon of the 28th of the same month. His wife, Xue Dai, heard the news and went to identify the body at the location. She was also shot in the left temple of her head, but fortunately the bullet did not injure the skull, so she escaped death.

The Kuailelin Film Company at No. 6 Renchang Lane, Rue Cardinal Mercier, was destroyed by fire due to carelessness at around 4:00 PM on the 5th of this month, burning eight tenants to death. After the case occurred, Zhang Bingsheng, the owner of the Kuailelin Film Company, was sued by the French Concession administrative authorities in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for causing death by negligence. The family members of the victims, Zhang Baotang's lawyer, also commissioned Huang Jiyuan's lawyer to appear in court, filing an incidental private prosecution requesting that the defendant Zhang Bingsheng be ordered to pay damages of more than 7,400 yuan. After Judge Miao Aibang summoned and ordered the defendant Zhang Bingsheng several times to pay 8,000 yuan in bail to be released and await trial, etc., it has been repeatedly recorded in previous reports. Judge Miao opened the First Criminal Division again yesterday to continue the trial. The defendant Zhang Bingsheng insisted on claiming that he was away on business when the fire broke out and requested leniency. However, the family members of the victims, Zhang Baotang and others, insisted that the defendant Zhang Bingsheng was guilty of negligence in his business and disregard for public safety by not properly storing flammable films, resulting in this fire that killed eight people, requesting that he be punished according to law. The court reviewed the testimony and ordered a debate, announcing the conclusion of the trial and setting the sentence for the 26th of this month. The defendant remained on his original bail.

### Shen A'biao Posted Bail in the Assault Case at Yuanshang Lane; Trial Set for Sentencing Yesterday

Morphine king Shen A'biao (i.e., "Pockmarked" A'biao), at the instigation of Zhang Xiaomao, a driver currently working for the Hu Mansion, led dozens of hooligans, including female hooligan Yang Ye and the fugitive robber Lao San, etc., each holding wooden sticks and knives, to the home of Xie Dejun, the owner of the Lao Zhengxing Restaurant on Yunnan Road, at No. 1 Yuanshang Lane, Dongzilaihuo Street, at around 4:00 PM on the 5th of this month, assaulting Xie without asking any questions, seriously injuring Xie's partner, Li Binghuan, and destroying all the furniture in Xie's room, opening the boxes and leaving with a whoop.

### Haimen Middle School to Relocate Back to the Mainland

Recently, prices in Shanghai have been soaring, and students from various places who come to Shanghai to study and reside are experiencing increasing difficulties in their lives. There are countless student families who cannot afford the burden. Therefore, some schools are relocating back to the mainland to operate. Yesterday, it was learned that Haimen Middle School on Haifang Road and Xiaoshadu Road has decided to relocate back to its original location when the fall semester begins. However, it will continue to enroll students in Shanghai to help those who cannot afford to continue studying in Shanghai. This school was originally located in Haimen County.

Now, because the Haihu area is not a military area, it has been peaceful as usual in recent years, so it has been decided to merge the Shanghai school with the Haimen school.

### Finance: Germany and the Soviet Union to Sign Non-Aggression Pact; Foreign Exchange Increasingly Loosening.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices showed no increase or decrease. In the black market for British and American exchange rates, spot and current month conditions were mediocre, but market sentiment was still affected by the tense European situation. Hong Kong banks such as Hua Bank and Huashang continued to sell, and Western merchant Sassoon also came to sell, but HSBC's appetite was still good, so the initial momentum was only slightly firm and stable. After 10:30 AM, news suddenly broke from Reuters that Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed to sign a non-aggression pact. Everyone believed that this was beneficial to China, so the selling trend became even stronger. However, because HSBC was still buying spot at lower prices, the loosening trend was blocked. The highest British gold price was 3/8 d., to 31.25, and the lowest US dollar price was 6.875. The market closed at 3/8 d. and 6.8125. September futures, in general, the bulls were increasingly panicked and competed to sell. Some banks, which had opened with buying prices in the morning, had become firm again at British gold 3/8 d. 1875 and US dollars 6.1875. Later, due to news that Germany and the Soviet Union would sign an agreement, the loosening trend became even sharper. One bank once bought US dollars at the extremely low price of 6.375, but the appetite of foreign banks such as Yuli was not weak, so the situation softened slightly. In the end, it was slightly looser than the previous day, at 1/8, and the US dollar also hardened by 25. Therefore, the swap for August and September saw a squeeze. According to the evening closing price, the British gold difference was 2.96875, and the US dollar difference was 5.9375. However, one bank was only willing to post half a yuan for the US dollar, which is equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of about 8%. Trading was still active throughout the day. It was also reported that due to the chaotic European situation, Chinese and Western merchants mostly conducted transactions through neutral country banks.

Bulls Panicked and Sold

The morning opening saw London gold close to four and a quarter higher for both near and far. New York silver prices rose sharply by 1.25. London raw gold remained flat. Exchange rates: British against US shrank by 1 hao, against French a slight increase of 1 centime, against Shanghai a significant increase of 0.0625. US against British/Shanghai remained flat, against French a rise of 0.0625. Central government listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Bank opening prices for spot exchange in the morning: British gold 3/8 d. 46875, US dollars 6.75, with no rise or fall compared to the previous closing. After the opening, market conditions were calm and trading was quiet. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no increases or decreases, and the silver balance tax was still exempted. After this, Hong Kong telegraphed to sell, estimated to sell spot British gold to foreign banks like HSBC for 3/8 d. and spot US dollars for 8.125. Then Huashang and Western merchant Sassoon successively sold to foreign banks such as Yuli and a certain American bank this month's British gold for 3/8 d. 46875 and half d., and this month's US dollars for 75 and 8.125. The process was extremely stable. Around 10:30 AM, Reuters reported that Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed to sign a non-aggression treaty. In addition, Chinese merchants were inclined to sell, causing the market to be firm, with the March futures even looser. Foreign merchants sold to foreign banks like HSBC spot British gold at 3/8 d. 53125 at different times and spot US dollars also hardened to 6.875. Later, Huashang bought from foreign banks September US dollars originally at 6.25, eventually soaring to 375. Approaching noon, the situation turned flat. Bank spot selling prices at noon close: British gold 3/8 d. and US dollars 6.8125. It was heard that it was difficult to settle at this price after closing.

September US Dollars Sold at 6 Yuan

In the afternoon, because Hong Kong telegraphed to sell again and Chinese banks also had intentions to sell, the market was stable and firm. It is estimated that Chinese banks and Hong Kong telegrams successively sold to foreign banks such as HSBC spot British gold at 3/8 d. and 53125, and spot US dollars at 6.8125. Later, Huashang yarn and cloth dealers also sold September US dollars to foreign banks such as Yuli for 6.1875 and 25.

### Hong Kong Investors Buy on Dips; Gold Prices Unlikely to Fall

Yesterday's cash gold spot market was lackluster, with no significant changes on the day, but volatility remained. Prices generally rose first, then fell, and then fluctuated. Initially, Hong Kong investors were strong buyers, and with a relatively stable foreign exchange trend, sellers were weak. The price briefly rose to 4,585 yuan. Subsequently, news broke from Reuters that Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed to sign a non-aggression pact, causing external demand to ease. This led to a wave of selling in the market, and with a temporary lack of support, the price plunged to a low of 4,500 yuan. However, securities firms quickly bought aggressively on the dip, and by noon, the price had rebounded to 4,560 yuan. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market showed some strength, causing many buyers to hesitate. Additionally, some money exchange houses successively offered to sell, causing the price to fall again to 4,530 yuan. Ultimately, the market closed at 4,535 yuan, a further decrease of 10 yuan from the previous day. However, operators continued to focus on the trends in European and domestic political situations, and trading remained active, at around 1,000 taels. Silver jewelry prices remained unchanged throughout the day, and customs gold and Sino-British pure gold prices remained consistent.

Spot Gold Down Another 10 Yuan

The price per bar (ten taels) at the start of the morning was relatively stable. Money exchange houses initially sold ten taels to silver firms at a price of 4,540 yuan, which was 5 yuan lower than the previous closing price. After the opening, some silver firms bought on behalf of customers, and money exchange houses also showed buying interest, causing the price to rise by 30 yuan in a short time. Money exchange houses traded 30 taels among themselves at 4,570 yuan. At that time, silver firms and cash dealers frequently offered to sell, causing the price to fall by 20 yuan. Silver firms sold 30 taels to gold dealers at 4,550 yuan. Subsequently, some silver firms resumed buying, and some gold dealers and money exchange houses also bought first, causing the price to rebound. Before long, the price rose by 35 yuan. Money exchange houses sold 50 taels to silver firms at 4,585 yuan. After 10:30 am, news broke from Reuters that Germany and the Soviet Union would sign a non-aggression pact. At the same time, due to strong foreign exchange rates, market sentiment deteriorated. Buyers temporarily hesitated, and money exchange houses and retail investors turned from buying to selling. Cash dealers were particularly eager to sell, causing the price to plunge by 85 yuan. Money exchange houses traded 20 taels among themselves at a price of 4,500 yuan. Subsequently, after hearing that the foreign exchange market had stabilized, securities firms aggressively bought on the dip and quickly recovered 60 yuan. Securities firms sold 10 taels to silver firms at 4,560 yuan, the closing price for the morning session. The market opened 5 yuan lower in the afternoon. Money exchange houses sold 10 taels to gold dealers at 4,555 yuan. Later, after hearing that the foreign exchange market was stable with a slight upward trend, although some silver firms bought slightly, some money exchange houses were still eager to sell, causing the price to fall another 25 yuan. Money exchange houses traded 10 taels among themselves at 4,530 yuan. Afterwards, some silver firms bought another 20 taels from money exchange houses at 4,535 yuan, the closing price for the evening session. As a result, the price fell another 10 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 85 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash dealers' gold was 1,000 yuan higher than the spot gold price. The current bid price for gold was 65 yuan lower than the listed price, with few transactions.

Jewelry Prices Remain Unchanged

The price of silver jewelry remained unchanged throughout the day. Da Tong Hang still quoted the original price of 460 yuan per tael, while Xin Tong Hang quoted 458 yuan. The purchasing price was reduced by about 20 yuan.

Sino-British Pure Gold Stable

London, August 21st, Reuters: The price of British pure gold remained stable at £7 8s 7d per ounce, causing the market prices of central banks to remain the same as the previous day.

### Discount Rate Declines

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts and bills decreased from high to low. The initial rate for each 1,000 yuan was close to the 200 yuan mark, but soon gradually fell. At noon, the rate was 195 yuan, and it remained stable in the afternoon, closing at 195 yuan, 2.5 yuan lower than the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Exchange Association remained unchanged, opening at 1.7 cents in both the morning and afternoon sessions.

### Pound Sterling Rises Alone

Yesterday, the supply of foreign currencies, including British, American, and gold pounds, was scarce. The British gold pound rose alone, while the American gold pound remained stable. However, British and American gold drafts decreased significantly due to the easing of foreign exchange rates and the fluctuating weakness of spot gold prices. Hong Kong drafts rose first and then fell, with no change in the final result. There was no demand for French francs and Annam piasters, and the market was weak. Australian gold and consignment drafts were weak, following the downward trend. There was strong demand for Japanese gold drafts, and the market was tight and expensive. Money exchange houses sold them at 1.20 yuan in the evening session. Korean piasters were very stable, selling for 1.01 yuan in the evening session. Other currencies remained stable. Yesterday's market prices were: British pound up 5 jiao, British gold drafts down 1.5 yuan, American gold drafts down 2 jiao, French franc drafts down 1.2 li, Annam piasters down 1.5 jiao, Australian gold drafts down 1 yuan, and other currencies unchanged.

### Overseas Silver Prices Soar

London, August 21st, Reuters: A sharp upward trend occurred in the silver market. Increased trading by India and speculators, coupled with a lack of supply, caused both near-term and long-term prices to rise sharply by 4.375. The market was firm after the close. India bought at 0.0625 above the listed price, and sellers held back. Also, New York: The American silver market was also firm. Spot prices soared by 1.125 to 3.625. Also, Bombay: Indian silver prices soared. Near-term and long-term futures prices rose sharply by 39 annas (2 rupees 7 annas), reaching above 48 rupees. The market later calmed down, with only 50 contracts traded and trading still thin.

### Food Prices: Early Season High-Quality Rice Opens at 39 Yuan; New Supplies Arrive Steadily; Market Returns to Normal in the Afternoon

Rice: New supplies from various regions are gradually increasing. Yesterday, a total of 14 cars of Songting brand early and late indica rice and Wheel Brand rice cakes arrived from downriver. In addition to over 1,000 packages of Linjing goods, over 1,000 packages of new Jiashan and Jiaxing pointed rice arrived in eight cars. Over 10,000 packages of new and old pointed rice from Wuhu and Nanjing arrived, so market sentiment eased slightly. The morning market continued the momentum from the previous day, and prices remained high, rising by another 1-2 yuan. However, local shops and stores remained cautious. The market trended downward in the evening, ultimately stabilizing. The subsequent market trend seems difficult to sustain. High-quality glutinous rice opened at 39 yuan, medium-quality at 38 yuan, fresh Changzhou glutinous rice at 39 yuan, and Su Tong Kun glutinous rice at 38.5 to 38 yuan. Early and late indica rice from Songjiang and Nanhai downriver opened at 35-34 yuan, original packages at 37.5-36.3 yuan, high-quality old Wuhu pointed rice at 36-35 yuan, and new Wuhu pointed rice at 34-33 yuan. No transactions of glutinous rice were reported. Total transactions in the city were estimated at over 7,000 packages.

Indica Rice: Buying interest remained strong yesterday morning, with high-quality Jingwu indica rice quoted at 35-36 yuan. However, as new indica rice from various regions has already been sampled, and 1,500 packages of new indica rice from Jiangbei have arrived, and as indica rice from the Jingwu and Jiangbei areas is transported to Shanghai by truck, although the quantity is not large, market sentiment has stabilized somewhat. It is also reported that rice merchants are requesting 100,000 packages of Wuhu rice permits from the Japanese side, so the selling price in the subsequent market has returned to normal.

Imported Rice: There were no formal transactions yesterday. Merchants held firm on their stockpiled goods. However, it was reported that various factories and groups in the city have purchased small quantities, ranging from 30-50 tons to 300-500 tons. Prices for No. 2 and No. 3 Saigon rice were around 40 yuan, and No. 1 high-quality Saigon rice was 44-45 yuan.

### Amidst Rising Rice Prices, Flour Sales Surge; Wheat Arrivals Continue Strongly; Selling Price Nears 10 Yuan

Flour: Yesterday's flour trading continued to be active. As flour sales increase daily amidst rising rice prices, retail sales at various flour shops have been overwhelming. Therefore, actual sales in the local area have surged. To maintain food supplies for the people, various factories have had to continue supplying flour as usual. However, large-volume transactions and wholesale sales to merchants are still being rejected. Total city transactions increased from over 20,000 packages to over 30,000 packages. It is reported that returned goods are favored by merchants, and trading is good, with prices still exceeding factory prices by more than 2 jiao.

Wheat: Supplies remain plentiful, with 6,000-7,000 packages arriving from various regions. Due to the activity of flour sales in the local area, factories have a strong need for raw materials, and many merchants are also buying. However, production costs are high, and merchants are hoarding goods amidst rising rice prices, unwilling to sell easily. Total city sales opened for wheat from Suzhou, Zhitang, Wuxi, Anting, Yangzhou, Kunshan, Nanjing, Changzhou, Benniu, Dan Yang, Wuyi, and Qishuyan, totaling 50 cars. Besides the 22 cars purchased by the Fuxin and Fufeng factories, the remaining were purchased by merchants. Prices rose by another 2-3 jiao compared to the previous day, with the highest price reaching 9.98 yuan.

### Oilseed Cake: Large-Scale Speculation; Oilseed Hoarding

Following the momentum from the previous day, prices for various oilseed cakes continued to rise sharply. Outsiders were willing to pay high prices to collect them, with the financial sector being the most active. Domestic industry became increasingly eager. Market prices changed three times a day. In the morning, soybean oil continued to rise by 1 yuan, with over 1,000 pieces of various oils and 1,500 cans transacted. Peanut oil opened with 500 cans, soaring by 1.5 yuan. Soybeans rose again by 1-1.5 yuan, with 700-800 packages opened. Other various grains jumped by 4-5 jiao (detailed market prices are listed in the market price section). In the afternoon, rumors unfavorable to the market spread, and market sentiment fluctuated, with the underlying trend remaining a large rise with small declines.

3,000 packages of soybeans arrived from Beisha on the 22nd.

### Yarn and Cotton: Sales to Merchants Stagnate; Yarn Market Reflects Sudden Increase; Double Globe Plummets by Over 10 Yuan

The yarn market opened high and closed low, with a hesitant trend. This situation has persisted for four to five days. However, the Hong Kong merchants, who had been actively buying for days, have now turned sluggish. In fact, the environment there is unfavorable, and they are temporarily pausing their purchases. Market prices are trending downward, and there is some awareness that prices have reached high levels. Stagnant sales to merchants have led to a sudden increase in supply, but raw cotton has not eased. However, prices are high, and factories are not buying. The price of 20-count Double Globe yarn was 635 yuan, a sharp decrease of 10.05 yuan from the previous day.

The market opened tight this morning due to small amounts of Double Horse yarn still being purchased by Guangzhou merchants, with opening prices up 3-4 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 777 yuan for goods in external warehouses and 693 yuan for warehouse receipts. Shortly after, news of easing foreign exchange rates and stagnant actual demand caused the market to loosen, and a downward trend began. Speculators rushed to close their positions, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell sharply to 764 yuan, and warehouse receipts fell to 677 yuan, a drop of 14-15 yuan in an instant. The total volume traded in half a day was only 826 packages. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell 11 yuan, and Double Globe fell 20.05 yuan. However, the price of wool fell only 2 yuan due to tight supply. Furthermore, today's cotton yarn exports included 45 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 20 pieces shipped to Haiphong, and 6 pieces of cloth also shipped to Haiphong and 16 pieces shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by various merchants are listed below:

Afternoon News: The yarn market continues to weaken as speculators are eager to close their positions. The current price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 760 yuan, a further decrease of about 4 yuan from the closing price.

### Exchange Rates Ease; Foreign Cotton Trading Active

Trading in domestic and foreign spot cotton is still relatively weak. Factories' buying interest is flat due to the slump in the yarn market. However, traders' sentiment is exceptionally shrewd because local inventories are decreasing daily and foreign companies' prices remain high. Therefore, some are holding tight to their goods, optimistic about the future.

Another report from Shanghai states that foreign cotton trading became active again yesterday due to news from Europe and easing exchange rates. The total volume traded yesterday was 500 bales of American cotton at 156 yuan and 300 bales of Brazilian cotton at 170 yuan.

The price of foreign cotton cloth in New York did not improve yesterday. In the morning, it rose slightly due to positive news from Liverpool, but the sudden changes in the European political situation and the signing of the Soviet-German pact caused anxiety, and trading was quiet. However, hedging sales were strong in the South, and short sellers mostly closed their positions due to the unpredictable political situation. As a result, market prices fell by 5-6 pounds. Indian cotton futures fell by 1.5 rupees, and Egyptian cotton fell by several pounds.

Indian cotton continues to arrive. According to previous reports, the British company Jardine Matheson's ship "Jilawa," which departed from Calcutta with 800 bales of cotton, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 21st and docked at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong, where unloading has been completed. The ship is carrying a large amount of goods to Japan and is scheduled to depart for Japan this morning. It is also reported that the British company Butterfield & Swire's "Elmbank," chartered by the Japanese company Yamashita, has departed for India to load cotton and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th of this month. The exact amount of cotton loaded is unknown, but it is estimated to be around 5,000 tons. Upon arrival in Shanghai, it will dock at Hongxing Wharf in Pudong for unloading. (Zuo)

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Fluctuate; Foreign Stocks See Some Selling

Yesterday's securities spot market showed no improvement, remaining in a fluctuating state. Market sentiment remained weak, with prices fluctuating within 1-2 jiao. Therefore, the high-low difference in the morning session was minimal. After the close, rumors suddenly spread that after the signing of the trade agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, there would be a non-aggression pact. Exchange rates lengthened. Factory sentiment stabilized slightly, and pricing was still strong, making it difficult to calculate profits. Chinese factories did not buy a single bale, and Japanese factories only purchased 100 bales of real cotton from Da Kang Factory, with delivery scheduled for September. The future of the cotton market remains uncertain. Supplies from northern Jiangsu are increasing, with 677 packages of Tongzhou cotton arriving. The sales situation is recorded below. Market sentiment was suddenly stimulated. International intrigue became increasingly bizarre, but it was beneficial to China. Therefore, the securities market suddenly rose slightly after the spot market. Class C stocks rose above 41 yuan. Since large investors are still watching, the rally has not been strong. The future may improve. At the opening, Tong Kang and Yong Kang sold successively, and there were many offers to sell No. 15 stocks. Later, Dafeng, Lianyi, and No. 14 stocks bought in, and prices strengthened slightly. Therefore, the result was only a fluctuation of 5 jiao, with high and low prices mixed. After the close, market sentiment was stimulated by rumors, and short covering suddenly increased, with a sudden rise of 6-7 jiao. Temporarily, some bulls sold off, and Class C stocks broke through 41 yuan, then retreated again. Market sentiment remains inconsistent. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 800,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below: Category, Highest, Lowest, Closing Price, Change from Previous Day.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity stock were traded at a price of 6.3 yuan.

Also, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that war fears enveloped the market, and some stocks were sold off in a panic. For example, "Katoob Road" rubber stock traded as low as 3 yuan, and buyers once had the right to command the buying price. No matter how low the bid price was, there were sellers willing to sell. Later, the pressure eased slightly, and the market rebounded slightly. Despite favorable factors in the current uncertain state, such as the recent sharp decrease of 3,500 tons in London rubber reserves, they were ignored. The market behavior in the next few days will depend on the development of the political situation.

London British Far East Companies Stocks: The listed prices on August 21st (Monday) uniformly fell. Mercantile Bank shares fell 5 shillings, priced at £6.5. HSBC Bank London-registered shares fell £3.5, priced at £68.5. Hong Kong-registered shares fell £4, priced at £71. Kaiping Coal Mine shares fell 1 shilling, priced at 12 shillings 6 pence. Kuala Klang Rubber shares fell 3 pence, priced at 17 shillings 3 pence. The rest remained stable.

London Chinese Foreign Bonds: The listed prices on August 21st (Monday) remained stable, with no changes in prices.

### Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Exports Encounter Obstacles for the First Time

Yesterday's silk market: New York near-term contracts fell 3.5 points, and far-term contracts remained unchanged. Japanese silk spot prices fell 7 points, Shanghai silk fell 6 points, Yokohama spot prices fell 3 yuan, and far-term contracts fell 2 yuan.

Local silk sales were sluggish, mainly due to export difficulties, and importers were watching. It was reported that a certain foreign company's silk exports had encountered obstacles for the first time. People in the silk industry are deeply aware of the impending crisis, so they have decided to ignore the so-called "Raw Silk Inspection Institute," and its methods will likely face difficulties.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Slightly Eases

Yesterday's sugar market reported slight improvement from overseas. The closing price for September was 7.00 Dutch guilders, London reported 6 shillings for December, 6 shillings 0.25 for March of next year, and 6 shillings 1 penny for June. The association's listed price for 24 coarse white small triangle sugar was 40.5 yuan for goods in local warehouses and 40.2 yuan for external warehouses, and 32.2 yuan for transshipment goods. Taikoo granulated white sugar eased slightly. Eastern warehouse B mark was down 2 jiao to 44.3 yuan, and Western warehouse rose 1 jiao to 44.8 yuan. The rest varied slightly by 1-2 jiao. H mark granulated red sugar rose 5 jiao to 28.5 yuan. Spot Dutch red sugar initially rose 0.5 yuan to 36.5 yuan, then rose another 0.3 yuan to 36.8 yuan. Transshipment goods rose 1 yuan before and after, initially to 30 yuan, then reaching 3 yuan. No changes were made to local No. 1 white sugar and local rock sugar. Only a few dozen packages of domestic sugar extract were opened, priced at 39 yuan.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: New Hunan Lotus Seeds Appear; Shipped from a Certain Party to Shanghai

New Hunan lotus seeds cannot be freely purchased in Hankou, and domestic merchants have not dared to try. It is reported that a certain party has shipped them to Shanghai, totaling 40 bags, which have already been sold. The merchant's listed price is 168 yuan, all for local lotus seeds. The market trend is firm, and the quality and selling price of old goods kept in cold storage are similar. There is not much stock in the market.

Spring and Autumn

### Shanghai One Day: Inside the Shikumen

— Liu Lang

Woke up in the morning and read the newspaper:

"...Rice store robbed...Conflict in western Shanghai...Subsidiary currency arrives in Shanghai..."

There was a noisy sound of people outside the door. My line of sight was disturbed and left the newspaper. My eardrums were again imprinted with the familiar mixed northern and southern accent of the landlady:

"You can't find a cheaper house than this anywhere you look. Sir! Fifteen yuan, in this day and age, can only be considered fifteen small coins, don't you think? Hahaha... Really, if it wasn't because there were so few of you, I really wouldn't want to rent it out!"

Images of fifteen yuan and a dark attic without sunlight or air were again intertwined in our minds, and feelings of hatred and resentment flooded our hearts again.

Just as I was about to gather my scattered thoughts and find the remaining news in the newspaper, the stairs thumped. Someone was running very anxiously, saying breathlessly:

"Early show opened, number sixteen!"

As soon as I heard this voice, I knew it was the tenant from the back building. He spends all day in the back building, which is like a chicken coop, holding a pencil in his hand, writing on a hand-folded book. People often run up to him, mutter a few words, and stuff something into his hand. Most of these people are old and young women. As for him, he only goes out in the morning, at lunchtime, and at dinner time. At first, I didn't know what he was doing. Later, I figured it out: he was running a "shipping boat."

My peace was disrupted. I simply got out of bed, though I didn't plan on doing anything after getting up. I sat there blankly, letting the various cries of street vendors in the alley chaotically collect in my ears.

"Bitter--ah--"

It was a woman's cry, pressing down on her throat and dragging out the final sound, coming from the front building on the second floor. A beautiful girl appeared before my eyes. She starts her day by practicing her vocalizations, and in the evening, a painted, effeminate drama teacher comes to teach her opera. Why should she learn such antiquated operas? I once asked the landlady – her father – and the reply was:

"What can a woman do? Even if she graduates from university, she still won't have anything to do. It's better to have her learn opera. In the future, if she has a little fame, two or three hundred yuan, six or seven hundred yuan, wouldn't be a difficult thing to earn."

"Another girl's life ruined by a bad family education!" I could only sigh helplessly.

The Beijing fiddle on the first-floor alcove rang again! Once in the morning, once in the afternoon, once in the evening, as if he was doing his homework. In my view, this person is the darling of this shikumen, and besides playing the huqin, he changes into a freshly ironed suit every day and goes out to play. I have never seen him have any worries about his life. I have never greeted him, and I don't know what kind of person he is, but I hate him for no reason.

My mother came back from the vegetable market with an unhappy expression. She muttered:

"It's really outrageous. I gave them stamps, and they嫌嫌 this and that, saying they wouldn't take them. I gave them fractional currency, and what they gave back wasn't even stamps! Really, if it wasn't for the sake of eating, who would be happy to put up with this? And, and those black-hearted rice shops, raising the price of rice to thirty-eight yuan. At this rate, we really won't be able to live!"

My mother threw the stamps in front of me, and I found that there were even cigarette coupons mixed in. She was very angry.

After this, the smoke from the stove enveloped me until after lunch.

In the afternoon, the front building on the third floor began to get lively. A dancer lived there, dressed up in bizarre and strange ways every day. Every afternoon, young men in suits came to visit her, and their lewd laughter was unbearable to hear.

I often associated this dancer with the female workers in the thread factory in the main room and the "wild chickens" in the back room. The female workers work all day long, and even the best of them only earn five mao a day. They say, "One person's food costs four mao a day!" And the "wild chickens" in the back room get up early to wash clothes, go out to the early market after lunch, and low sobbing can often be heard late at night. Compared to them, that dancer is more comfortable. In fact, this is just a superficial comparison. That dancer has a mother who smokes opium and is often scolded severely for lacking money. They are all women suffering from the same hardships!

I hate this shikumen, but I don't have the power or courage to move. So, I stay cooped up in this shikumen all day long, from the time I get up in the morning until the landlady closes the main gate at twelve o'clock at night.

### The Eve of the Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes

— Su Chen

Since copper coins were bought up by unscrupulous merchants, leading to the use of stamps as currency in the market, the troubles are needless to say, and the disputes arising therefrom are countless. Thus, every citizen looks forward to the early issuance of fractional currency notes.

The newspaper the day before yesterday told us the good news: the fractional currency notes are scheduled to be issued on the 22nd, and some newspapers even printed copperplate images. However, before this good news arrived, unfortunately, confusion arose again. Let me report what I saw in the past two days:

Regarding the disposal of the 400,000 yuan worth of stamps, the three suggestions made by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, except for the first one which is no problem, according to the news in yesterday's newspaper, the second and third points are "beyond the scope of postal services and there is no room for consideration." In other words, it is impossible for the post office to take them back. However, many shops, households, and vendors now have a considerable amount of stamps in their hands. They are kept for mailing letters, but in reality, they cannot use so many. Moreover, the small amount of capital of vendors and merchants is affected by the difficulty in selling stamps, which affects their business, no, their livelihood! Now that they hear that fractional currency notes are about to be issued, they naturally hope for it like a great drought hoping for rain clouds. But what follows is the transitional period on the eve of the issuance, which has created a chaotic phenomenon.

Everyone knows that after the issuance of fractional currency notes, the stamps in hand will be stranded. However, business must be done, so all whole-number transactions in places like dry goods stores and small vegetable markets require a minimum purchase of one mao (dime). When there is really no other way and there are odd amounts, they are willing to accept the fare coupons issued by the tram company because these fare coupons can be exchanged for cash. As for tofu stalls, pancake stalls, etc. on every street, although they cannot hang signs saying that they do not sell for odd amounts, they accept the fare coupons of the tram company. For the remainder, they temporarily stamp a paper with the store's seal as proof, and they are responsible for taking it back after the fractional currency notes are issued. In this way, the trouble of the procedures is needless to say, and the cost of living has increased invisibly.

Originally, this is a phenomenon that should exist during the transitional period. The loss of one or two days can always be tolerated, but the issuance of fractional currency notes has been postponed again due to insufficient procedures. The newspapers did not specify how long this postponement would be. On the one hand, stamps can no longer be used, and on the other hand, the issuance of fractional currency notes is postponed. If the chaotic situation of these two days continues to expand during this extended transitional period, it is indeed worrying!

Therefore, we make one last request to the postal authorities, that is, to be complete and clean, and to especially consider the general public, and allow them to be taken back, or even limit the amount each person can exchange, because it is most important to stabilize the lives of vendors and merchants at present!

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Fifteen: Overseas Scandal Suddenly Welcomes Peach Leaves, Miraculous Scene in the Fire Actually Blooms Lotus Flowers

However, white people have always held deep-seated prejudices against people of color. They believe that Eastern culture, no matter what, is ultimately inferior to Western culture. For example, a young man like Chenggong is praised by the teachers in the school. In exams, his grades may even be better than those of white children. However, their prejudice is simply that it is a pity that Chenggong is not a European or American, but a Chinese. Therefore, although Alice is getting closer to Chenggong, her parents and relatives ultimately do not want Alice to marry a Chinese. Alice has an aunt, a devout Catholic who is a spinster and has never married. She is somewhat conservative and stubborn. She even taught Alice's mother to enforce the rule and not allow her to associate with Chenggong anymore. At this time, the love between Alice and Chenggong had gradually taken root. It seemed that if they did not see each other for a few days, they would miss each other. Alice felt that it was really turning a game into reality. One day, her aunt, using a preaching tone, wanted to persuade Alice not to marry a Chinese. She collected all the bad things about the Chinese as her material. She said: "Chinese people want to bind their feet. Even if they don't bind your feet, they won't teach you to bind your feet. If you have a daughter in the future, they will force her to bind her feet. Are you willing to turn your lovely baby into a deformed cripple with her two feet?" She said: "Chinese parents are very dignified. A daughter-in-law has to kowtow to her parents-in-law. I heard that the Chinese boy surnamed Cheng has lost his father, but his mother is still alive. The Chinese have a large family system, and there are many elders. When you go to China with him in the future, will you have to kowtow to each of them?" She said: "The Chinese have a polygamous system. It is not surprising to have three wives and four concubines. When you go to China, you will be isolated and helpless, and you will become a Chinese citizen. Your motherland will no longer be able to protect you. When that happens, your man will fall in love with someone new and abandon you. What can you do? Will your lifelong happiness be sacrificed in vain?" She said: "In the Chinese marriage system, if a man dies, a woman cannot remarry. She has to observe chastity for him until she dies. If a woman dies, a man can marry another woman within a month, and no one will say he is unfeeling. This is stipulated by Chinese law and customs. Do you think you can endure such gender inequality?" In addition, she nagged and said many embarrassing things. In conclusion, marrying a Chinese man would ruin a woman's happiness. There is nothing more foolish than this! (172)

Life Reports

### Buttonholes

— Xu You

In ordinary tailor shops selling ready-made Western suits, after they rent a small shop, they divide the shop to make a buttonholing room, which must have ten to twenty female workers who make buttonholes.

Here, you can never see the sunlight, and a five-candlepower electric light is lit all day long. This group of buttonholing female workers makes those small navy blue buttonholes under this dim light. Humid, dark, foul odor, coupled with deafening machine noise, people who come here for the first time will feel seasick.

The company undertakes mostly overcoats, raincoats, and most of all school uniforms. They pull and sew stitch by stitch every day.

A Zhongshan suit has a total of thirty-one buttons, and at most four sets can be sewn every day. The wage for each set is one dime. A raincoat has eight buttons, but the wage is only five cents. Work clothes have ten buttons, but the wage is still five cents. Even if you work hard, you can earn at most forty cents a day, and you have to pay for the thread yourself.

Others may think that this needlework life is easy and effortless, but when you have worked for three hours, you will feel dizzy and blurred.

If the sewing is not done well and is found out during inspection, it must be taken apart and resewn. Once the buttonhole has been taken apart, the threads will loosen, and the work done will be twice as laborious as the first time.

The work in tailor shops is seasonal. When it is busy, you are so tired that you cannot breathe. You have to work fourteen or fifteen hours a day, so dizzy and blurred that your head feels like it weighs dozens of pounds. When it is idle, there are only one or two days a week to work, or even seven days of eating white rice at home.

### Concentrating Manpower, Materials and Financial Resources: RKO's New Film Plan

— A Yun

——Completing Fifty-Eight Feature Films

July of each year is the period when all film companies in Hollywood are mobilized, and there is a comprehensive review of the production policy for the second half of the year and the next year, personnel transfers, budget estimates, and signing of sales contracts. RKO Pictures announced a shocking new film plan during this period, which is to produce fifty-eight feature films and one hundred and ninety-eight short films from the second half of 1939 to the first half of 1940. The magnitude of this number can be said to be a brand new record in the history of RKO production.

Comedic stars Laurel and Hardy will also star in "The Flying Deuces" under the banner of RKO. There is also a comedic giant, Luo Ke, who also has his own new work distributed by RKO. The star lineup is quite large, including Qin Shu Lao Ji Si, Que Er Si Lao Dun, Li Si Kang Huo Hua, Ka Luo Lang Bai, Ka Lai Ge Lun, Anna Ni Ge Er, Fan Peng Ke Jr., Lei Meng Ma Sai, An Xiu Lan, Wei Duo Mai Ke Luo Lun, Li Que Di Ke Si, Shi Bei Zi Ling, Ke Lan Qu Le Fo, etc., all have excellent starring works.

What is most worthy of special mention is that the artistic master Hua Er De Di Si Nai, who gave the princess a special white, will put all his efforts in 1939-1940 to produce another five-color feature cartoon, named "Pinocchio". The capital and technical personnel used in the film are twice as much as "Snow White". When it is completed in the future, it will surely cause a sensation around the world.

The great French writer 俄氏's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is once again made into a sound film, starring the most outstanding film actor Que Er Si Lao Dun. His superb acting skills and calm demeanor in playing this role will undoubtedly overwhelm the past Lang Que Nai.

There is also a historical epic film about Lincoln, "Abe Lincoln in Illinois", starring the New York actor Lei Meng Ma Sai. In addition, there is a Broadway hit "The American Way", which has been a sensation for two years. Ka Lai Ge Lun stars in "Passport to Life", and Li Si Lian Huo Hua plays three roles at the same time, starring in, producing, and directing "The Man Who Lost Himself".

This time, RKO Pictures will concentrate manpower, materials, and financial resources to complete the above-mentioned plan in twelve full months.

Notes from the Entertainment Industry

### One Aspect of Acting Experience (Part 1)

— Sun Min

Talking about the Difficulty of Villainous Roles and Virtuous Roles

Editor's Note: Sun Jing has been dedicated to the film industry very early, and he is also a veteran in the film industry with a lot of acting experience. In the past, he had a wide reputation and was known as the "Romantic Young Man". In recent years, since he changed to playing villainous roles, he has become a screen villain denounced by everyone. It can be said that his ability to play both virtuous and villainous roles is his strength, and the arguments in this article are all based on experience and are very interesting.

When the domestic film industry was just budding, I joined this barren art garden and became a loyal laborer. First, I studied at the China Film School, and then joined the Shenzhou Company. I filmed for nearly three years, and then transferred to "Great China" for two years, "Great Wall" for two years, "Tianyi" for four or five years, "Mingxing" for more than four years, and until this spring when I was invited to "Xinhua". I have filmed no less than a hundred films. In terms of experience, I seem to be no weaker than others, but in terms of results, I always feel that I only have a false reputation and there are no satisfactory works.

In the past, I only played virtuous roles and was always called the "Romantic Young Man". In the domestic film style five or six years ago, before it was transformed into focusing on consciousness, except for so-called martial arts films, all the young male roles were based on the so-called "handsome and elegant" form, and there was no fundamental difference between tough and soft roles. Later, there was a new realization on this, and I also followed the changes of the times.

The reason why I suddenly changed from playing virtuous roles to playing villainous roles was when I joined "Mingxing" six years ago. At that time, most people felt that there was a lack of villainous young male roles of the new type. Several directors thought that I had enough acting experience to cope with it, so they asked me to take on the role. After this change of style, and with their praise, I was no longer allowed to play virtuous roles again. Until now, I have passively become a role specializing in playing villainous roles.

Although villainous and virtuous roles seem to be the same as acting, I have many different feelings in my experience. In fact, villainous roles are much more difficult to play than virtuous roles. In reality, it is not only difficult and not easy to please, but the general public also tends to view the position of villainous roles as lower than virtuous roles. Judging from this, playing villainous roles is indeed too much of a disadvantage.

### Tan Li Debin

— Zheng Yu

Young Male Actor of Song Dezhus Troupe

The first batch of actors after the autumn cool season at the Golden Grand Theater have invited Song Dezhu and Yang 森. I have written about Song and Yang in this newspaper. I have not mentioned the supporting actors of Dezhu. The supporting actors of Dezhu have been invited and will not be changed. There are young male actor Li Debin, martial arts actor Xiao Deyin, clown Ai Shiju, martial arts assistant Tong Dexin, etc. Among them, Xu Shiju is already well-known to the people of Shanghai and does not need to be introduced. Deyin will be recorded in another article. Here, the so-called is the young male actor Li Debin.

Debin was originally named Zhibin. His father died early, so he and his mother lived in his maternal grandfather's house and were raised by his uncle, so he was able to become an adult. He studied in elementary school in his childhood. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, he was admitted to the opera school. The school thought that he was beautiful and gentle, so he asked the old actor Feng Huilin to teach him young male dramas. His opening play was "Yuan Dou Shooting Halberd". Later, he was guided by the famous ticket holder Bao Dan Ting. He can perform more than a hundred plays, and he is best at performing hero roles, such as "Eight Great Hammers", "Ya Guan Lou", "Cui Ying Hui", and "Yellow Crane Tower". He is also a masterpiece. Recently, he will come to the south with Dezhu to dedicate his art to us. At this time when there is a lack of young male talents, it is expected that Debin, who is both civil and military, will become popular in Shanghai.

### Visiting the Dance League

— Mu Zi

(1) Motivation

At the end of June this year, the Dance League, like a child leaving its mother's arms, began to learn to walk. In early autumn, it became more lively. I want to visit the "Dance League" to record some laughter or bitterness for the suffering sisters under the flooding tide of the times.

(2) A Terrible and Lovely Girl? Before entering the gate of the Dance League, I first remembered a sentence. This was told to me by a friend who could tell witty words two years ago: "This is a terrible and lovely girl!" After entering the gate, I only saw a piece of sky blue. Before I could see clearly, a plain-dressed and smiling girl walked out of it. She bowed deeply to me and asked me in a bell-like clear and soft tone: "Which one are you looking for, sir?"

After explaining the purpose, she expressed welcome and led me to visit the inner room: several ladies sitting and reading books stood up and stared at me. The lady who led the visit introduced them to me one by one. They all wore homespun clothes.

(3) Embarking on the Bright Road

In the inner room, in addition to a piano placed in the center, what can attract people's attention most should be the inscriptions of many celebrities. Mr. Yuan's dragon "Self-Reliance" and Mr. Kanghou's old-fashioned handwriting "If you have surplus energy, use it to learn." Here, there is also a newspaper reading area and a book lending department. The music room and the reception room are connected. The inner room and the outer room are only separated by a moon gate. This design is clever and beautiful enough. It is easier to make people feel a quiet pleasure when accompanied by a piece of sky blue. In the center of the office is a large notice board. All the words on the notices are written in vernacular or even more vulgar words. Looking from the outer room to the inner room, you can clearly see a long couplet in the moon gate: "Embarking on the bright road, offering that pure conscience." How profound are these words.

(4) From now on, I will never use suicide to end a useful life.

During the visit, I had many conversations with the plain-dressed and smiling girl, but I never dared to ask her name, because in my understanding, I came to visit the "League" and not to know the "people", but the "people" were finally known. This is the last few words of that girl, and it is also my first real emotion for this. When she spoke excitedly, I was afraid that she would shed tears. She was spitting out word by word in a fighting voice: "Sir, we are human beings, we are also women who have souls and are willing to move forward. We must work harder to awaken our sisters. From now on, we will never use suicide to end our useful lives!"

### New Inventions in the Film Industry

— (Jing Yuan)

Recently, a famous cinema in London—the Wen He Cinema—has adopted a new invention that allows deaf people to hear the sounds emitted by the film.

The device of this new invention is to connect an amplifier to a microphone, which is installed on the sound machine behind the screen, and then connect it to the specially set seats with underground wires (placed under the carpet). When the film is screened, due to the relationship of the induced current, the sound is transmitted to the eardrums of the deaf people, which is extremely clear, so that the deaf people can hear the dialogues and songs directly emitted from the screen. This new invention has made the business of Wen He Cinema much better.

Currently, major cinemas are installing them one after another.

Shaving and Plucking Hairs are the Two Great Sufferings of Actors

Westerners often wash their hair with cold water, intending to show skill, but the Chinese habit of shaving must first use boiling water to scald and wash, and then shave it. If done occasionally, it will not cause much harm. If a Jing Xing (painted-face actor) has to do this every day, his pain and unsanitary condition are probably the worst. In the past, in the backstage of opera troupes, there were often one or two barbers who were good at doing the washing and shaving work for the Jing Xing. Now that there are safety razors, and the big actors are using porters to carry their bags, these daily chores are mostly done by these deaf people. However, some theaters still use barbers as before.

It is a unique situation on the Chinese stage to have men dress up as women, but after a man reaches the age of twenty, his beard will naturally grow out. Moreover, the more you hate this thing, the faster it grows. The more often you shave it, the harder and blacker it becomes. Once you reach the age of thirty, it is simply impossible to stop it. Imagine that a Dan Jue (female role) relies entirely on a delicate face and fair skin to be welcomed. If the beard is too dense and too strong, even if you can shave it off with a knife once a day, the black stubble turns a dark green color when you apply powder, which is exactly as the saying goes, "smearing lime on an eggplant," which really reduces the beauty. If an old Zheng Gong Qing Yi (leading female role), such as Chen Delin and Wu Caixia, occasionally plays a role, the audience can especially forgive them, because they pay close attention to their singing, acting, and skills, and have long put the question of beauty aside. For the four famous Dan (female roles) such as Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang, and other male Dans, it seems that the audience's psychology cannot be separated from the question of beauty. Therefore, everyone has to discuss the beauty of the "appearance" at the mouth and neck. (86)
