### Chamberlain Announces in British Parliament: Final Reply Sent to Germany, Correspondence Temporarily Unannounced, Only Main Points Explained, Hitler Calls Party, Government, and Military Conference to Discuss Reply

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated this afternoon in the House of Commons that since the adjournment of the House on August 25th, the danger of a calamitous outbreak has not diminished, nor has there been much change. Although a great disaster has not yet arrived, I cannot say that the danger has lessened. During this period, the various developments in the situation should be reported to the House of Commons as much as possible. This will be the principle we will adhere to in any future meetings of the House. The Prime Minister then advised the press to exercise extreme caution in their statements, saying that inconsiderate remarks in the press, though not particularly important, could undermine the government's entire effort to seek a satisfactory solution. He also said that the British government's final reply to Germany was delivered to the German leader last night. We have stated therein that Britain's obligations to Poland will be implemented. We now await Hitler's response. The time ahead is for us to study the situation and allow the many forces working for peace to proceed, depending on the nature of the German reply. At the same time, we have no doubts or disagreements about our duties. Our resolve is not weak (cheers from the crowd). We have prepared everything. The Prime Minister then detailed Britain's military preparations, saying that air defenses have been well deployed, and the air force is ready for war. Although the issue of peace or war is still undecided, we will not slacken our resolve to adhere to our established course. We have no fear, nor any violent impulses. All this is due to our plans, and the calmness of the British people is also commendable. The Prime Minister then mentioned the exchange of documents between London and Berlin, saying that Sir Nevile Henderson returned from Berlin on Saturday night, believing that Berlin did not consider his return that day necessary. However, Hitler was eager for us to carefully study his note, so the British government spent the entire Saturday night and Sunday morning making a very careful and thorough study of the German document. It was then decided to reply, and the knight flew back to Berlin with the reply yesterday and personally delivered it to Mr. Hitler last night. He was happy to publish the contents of the two documents. However, members of the House should know that in such a delicate situation, with such a serious dispute, and with danger hanging in the balance, publishing such confidential documents or commenting in detail at this stage would not be in the public interest. Hitler was eager for a complete and lasting understanding between Britain and Germany and wanted Britain to feel his desire. Hitler also stated emphatically that the issue between Germany and Poland must be resolved immediately. The British government, of course, welcomes discussions with Germany to permanently resolve the dispute, but everything will depend on how the current dispute between Germany and Poland is handled. The necessary condition for a beneficial opportunity for discussion of the German-Polish problem is to reduce the tension on both sides of the border. Therefore, the British government hopes that the governments of Germany and Poland will do their utmost to prevent accidents from recurring and to stop the spread of false rumors and the occurrence of other dangerous events.

(London) The House of Commons convened at 2:45 PM this afternoon, and the hall was packed. Everyone present warmly welcomed Prime Minister Chamberlain when they saw him. The Prime Minister then delivered a speech, briefly stating that Leader Hitler had declared to our government his willingness to establish a complete and lasting understanding between the two countries and had also emphasized that various issues between Germany and Poland urgently needed to be resolved, in clear and unambiguous terms. Our country's obligations to Poland, which were confirmed by the agreement signed on the 25th of this month, will definitely be fulfilled. This has already been clearly stated. In short, the British government still hopes that the consultations between Germany and Poland can lead to a fair solution through free negotiations, thereby concluding a broader agreement that will benefit world peace. The key to peace or war is still undecided. We still hold hope and are willing to continue to work for peace. However, since we have chosen a course, we must adhere to it unswervingly. All naval, land, and air forces are ready and can handle all contingencies. (Members of Parliament cheered enthusiastically.) Thereupon, the House of Commons adjourned until September 5th, but could still be convened at any time if necessary. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) Leader Hitler, along with key figures from the party, government, and military, has been holding meetings at the Chancellery without interruption. General Keitel and General von Brauchitsch, Commanders-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Minister of Aviation Göring, and Minister of Propaganda Goebbels all left the Chancellery before 4 PM. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) At 1 AM this morning, Leader Hitler was still at the Chancellery, discussing the document brought by the British ambassador and the German government's forthcoming reply with Minister of Aviation Göring and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop late into the night. It is believed that the written reply can be delivered to British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson this morning. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 29th)

### British Ambassador Flies to Berlin, Immediately Meets with Hitler, Berlin Political Circles Say the Door to Negotiations is Not Closed, German Government to Issue Important Statement

(Berlin) British Ambassador to Germany Sir Nevile Henderson flew here from London at 8:30 PM today. He immediately drove to the British Embassy to talk with French Ambassador Coulondre. Then, at 10:15 PM, he went to the Chancellery, where Leader Hitler immediately received him. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Foreign Ministry interpreter Schmidt were present. Minister of Aviation Göring also arrived shortly thereafter. The meeting ended at 11:40 PM. It can be seen that Ambassador Henderson not only delivered the British reply to Leader Hitler but also discussed the situation at length. Afterward, an official statement was issued, saying only that Leader Hitler met with British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson at 10:30 PM in the evening, and the ambassador personally delivered a document from the British government. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. Leader Hitler then held a meeting with key government figures, which lasted all night. It is generally believed that the German government will submit a written reply to Britain tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) When British Ambassador Henderson arrived at the Chancellery, the Black Guards saluted with their rifles and immediately led him to Hitler's office. Mr. Henderson quickly walked into the brightly lit inner room, where several high-ranking Nazi officials in brown uniforms stood up to greet him. Regarding the content of the British reply, not a word has been revealed to the outside world. According to Reuters, although the situation is extremely serious, the possibility of a peaceful solution has not been completely blocked. People in London feel that the key to peace or war in Europe lies in the hands of Hitler alone. Mr. Henderson was photographed by people when he left the London airport at 4 PM this afternoon, and he looked quite happy. Before leaving, he bid farewell to the reporters who saw him off, saying, "Thank you for seeing me off. I sincerely hope that this trip will have good luck." The plane Mr. Henderson took was a Lockheed airliner of British Airways, the same type of plane that Prime Minister Chamberlain took to Germany last year.

(Berlin) It is expected that the German government will issue a document, but when it will be issued is not yet known. The air here is filled with anticipation. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) Berlin is now filled with tension and anticipation. After British Ambassador Henderson returned here with the British government's important reply, it is generally said that all events have now rapidly reached a decisive period. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### Messengers Shuttle Between London and Berlin, Two More Germans Fly to London

(London) British Ambassador to Germany Sir Nevile Henderson, who took a plane to Berlin yesterday, arrived at Heston Airport in the suburbs at 3:30 PM this afternoon. There were three passengers in total, one British and two German. The luggage was labeled with the name of British Chargé d'Affaires in Germany Sir Forbes. British Airways officials refused to announce who the passengers were. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) It is heard that the British reply requested Germany to make a glorious retreat so that an international peace conference could be convened. This peace conference may be convened by Mussolini. (Associated Press dispatch, 28th) Rome The Roman People's Daily recently stated that according to remarks made by external personnel today, the British note to Germany contained the suggestion that Germany and Poland first demobilize a portion of their forces and postpone for several months to allow the atmosphere to cool down, and then hold a meeting. If the British note is based on such naive remarks, then there is little hope for preserving Europe. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) Reliable sources in Germany say that Hitler completed military preparations last night. The regular army has been fully mobilized, totaling about 2.5 million troops, all of whom have been deployed to key locations. Nazi Party sources say that Hitler is determined to first recover Danzig and the Polish Corridor and then consider peace negotiations. However, if peace negotiations can proceed according to Hitler's wishes, he may change his attitude. Hitler is extremely willing to cooperate with all parties to maintain European peace, but all parties must make considerable concessions. Senior Nazi Party officials believe that there will be no military action this week, although they also acknowledge that the situation is volatile. German officials say that no genuine action has yet been seen regarding mediation. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) A spokesman for political circles told a Reuters reporter today that the door to negotiations is still open, but we must insist on realizing the German leader's demand for the return of Danzig and the Corridor to Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### Belgium and the Netherlands Mediate for Peace, Plan to Convene a Five-Nation Conference

(Paris) It has been learned that Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pierlot, during a meeting with French Ambassador Bargeton last night, requested him to convey to the French government that the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands are willing to come forward to mediate and try to convene a five-nation conference of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland in order to find a peaceful solution to the current crisis in Europe. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

Belgian Capital The Belgian News Agency recently issued a message stating that Prime Minister Pierlot met with the ambassadors of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, and the envoy of Poland, and the discussion concerned Belgium taking on the role of mediator. However, official circles have not yet confirmed this. In addition, the Belgian government's preventive measures for the current military situation are already sufficient, and there are no plans to take further action for the time being. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### Ambassador Guo Visits British Foreign Secretary

(London) Diplomatic and political figures here were unusually active today. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi and Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru successively visited the Foreign Office in the evening to conduct talks with foreign authorities. Shigemitsu Mamoru stayed at the Foreign Office for an hour and a half. Dominion Secretary Inskip summoned senior commissioners stationed in England from the various dominions to inform them of the contents of the government's reply delivered to German leader Hitler. Prime Minister Chamberlain met with opposition Labour Party leader Greenwood at 4:30 PM in the afternoon, reportedly also to explain the contents of the reply. In addition, the National Labour Movement Executive Committee is scheduled to meet in the House of Commons tomorrow evening to discuss the European situation. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

Editorial

### Britain's Far Eastern Policy

Chinese Ambassador to England Guo Taiqi met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax in London yesterday; the details of the meeting were not made public. It is rumored that the British Foreign Secretary provided assurances to Ambassador Guo, stating that even if there were drastic changes in the European situation, Britain's Far Eastern policy would not change. Both his words and his actions remain to be verified, but we believe they are credible.

In the past five or six days, the general atmosphere in the international arena, following the sudden signing of the non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany, has become more gloomy and turbulent. This is because countries directly affected by the Soviet-German treaty, with their interests at stake, should urgently take action to adapt to the new situation. All changes involve much effort and are unavoidable and reasonable. There are also those who are driven by emotion, rushing and shouting without understanding the facts; there are also those who are confined by temporary changes, worrying about gains and losses, and acting like the hungry who do not choose their food. Upon examining the propaganda from all sides, weaknesses are evident; thus, the superficial turbulence appears more intense than the actual evolution. The assurances made by the British Foreign Secretary yesterday have the effect of making a portion of the international turbulence tend towards clarification and stability, which is commendable.

How has the international situation come to its present state? The causes, consequences, merits, and demerits are not limited to one aspect; some blame Britain, but in reality, Britain is hardly solely responsible. However, Britain is encountering the most difficult circumstances, which should be universally recognized. In Europe, it is the object of German resentment; in the Far East, it is squeezed by Japan. To be tough would risk triggering a war and sacrificing too much; to yield would risk losing national power and approaching collapse. To ally with the United States is often hindered by American isolationism; to befriend the Soviet Union is ultimately rejected by the Soviet Union's isolationist policy. As of today, it can only watch Hitler's moods while maintaining a strong defense. Although, the unity and firmness of British public opinion have never been greater than they are today. When it wanted to be tough but dared not, wanted to yield but could not, it wavered on the crossroads, and every step was wrong, only attempting to achieve both ends by luck, only attempting to find a shortcut. Now, although peace or war depends on Germany's decision, it is truly in a situation where it has reached the final turning point, and it is no longer possible to have other thoughts. If there is war, a mobilization order will be issued, and there will be no turning back; if there is no war, there will be a joint effort to resolve all kinds of disputes, which is not just a matter for Britain alone. When it was pursuing Moscow, it hesitated and had endless hopes; with many hopes, its ideas were inevitably mixed and impure; moreover, trying to abandon real contradictions and break traditional barriers with the Soviet Union, whose doctrines, policies, national character, and national institutions are completely dissimilar, is truly no different from simultaneously tasting sweet, sour, and bitter. Inevitably, suspicion arises, and one is overwhelmed with gratitude. Now, the signing of the non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany is a straightforward creation for the Soviet Union and Germany, and it clears away strange illusions for the international community. For Britain, it seems like an unexpected change, but in reality, it can recognize the true face, which is also a valuable harvest. The British do not say they have gained nothing.

Today's Britain, after twists and turns, returns to its original state, and after磨折, it becomes firm. It will inevitably put away its illusions from now on and have no other thoughts. Protecting national power and protecting rights and interests have no shortcuts, nor can they be borrowed from the international community. International relations, whether close or distant, must have a basis; it is not a matter of hastily following along and acting perfunctorily. Whether to cooperate or not depends on national policy and needs; each country has its own national policy. Seeking to change the national policy of other countries to suit one's own needs and appealing to diplomacy will ultimately fail. If needs coincide, it is better to respect the national policies of other countries. Examining Britain's Far Eastern policy in this light, there are three aspects that today's Britain can certainly fully understand: Given China's emphasis on trustworthiness and the shared interests of China and Britain, and given that China has adopted resistance as the only way to deal with aggression, and that China has adopted defending the integrity of its sovereignty and territory as the only goal of resistance, Britain should confirm its significance and do its best. Only strength should be considered; this is the first aspect. The squeeze that Britain has been subjected to in the Far East is fundamentally due to the contradiction between the interests of the status quo and ambition, not due to international incitement, not due to the conflict of doctrines, nor to any friendship, enmity, or grievances outside of interests. Today's changes in the international situation are not enough to reconcile fundamental contradictions, nor do they seem to be able to eliminate the ambitions of the other party. The impact of international changes on Britain in the Far East is, at most, that the squeeze it is subjected to may have different degrees of urgency and visibility in the future, but it will not be free from being squeezed; this is the second aspect.

The United States has a fixed national policy in the international arena. It has inevitable attitudes and distinctions towards China, Britain, Germany, and Japan. However, the efficiency of promoting its national policy will vary with the situation. Some believe that the United States sympathizes with Britain and France, so it will woo Japan in the Far East for Britain and France. This depends entirely on whether the Far Eastern policies of Britain and France suit the national policy of the United States. Others believe that if Britain and France woo Japan, they can offset the Soviet Union's change of heart. In fact, if the actions of Britain and France in the Far East conflict with the national policy of the United States, then wooing Japan can also offset the sympathy of the United States; this is the third aspect. The British authorities must be familiar with all three of these aspects. Therefore, what Foreign Secretary Halifax candidly said to Ambassador Guo is likely not empty words.

(Tokyo) After visiting Mr. Machida, Mr. Nakajima, Mr. Kuhara, and others this afternoon, General Abe gathered his cabinet formation advisors Endo Ryusaku, Yokoyama Sukenari, and Kanozawa Toshiki at the Kasumigaseki Hall in Toranomon at 3:30 PM to discuss the active formation of a cabinet. The decision on all key members of the new cabinet must be completed by the morning of the 30th, and the inauguration ceremony of the cabinet ministers is planned to be held in the Imperial Palace in the afternoon of the same day. (Domei dispatch, 29th)

(Tokyo) According to news released tonight, the selection of members for the Japanese Abe cabinet will be officially announced at the earliest tomorrow. The list is roughly as follows:

Prime Minister: General Abe, Foreign Minister: Shigemitsu (Abe will temporarily serve as Foreign Minister before Shigemitsu returns to the country), Minister of Interior: Ohara Nao (former Minister of Justice during the Okada cabinet), Minister of Finance: Aoki Kazuo, Minister of the Army: Hata Shunroku, Minister of the Navy: Yoshida Zengo, Minister of Justice: Miyagi Chogoro, Minister of Education: Kawaharada Gaho (former Minister of Interior during the Hayashi Gonnosuke cabinet), Minister of Commerce and Agriculture: Godo Takuo, Minister of Communications: Nagai Ryutaro (former Minister of Colonial Affairs during the Saito cabinet), Minister of Colonial Affairs: Kanemitsu Tsuneo (Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives). (Associated Press dispatch, 9th)

(Tokyo) Okuchi Zenroku of the Japanese Seiyukai has decided to join the new cabinet. (Domei dispatch, 29th)

(Tokyo) The new Prime Minister Abe is currently very busy meeting with various leading politicians for the formation of a cabinet. However, it is generally expected that the new cabinet will be difficult to complete before Wednesday evening. The Japanese newspapers and financial circles have expressed their approval of Abe's appointment. The newspapers expect Abe to continue to pursue the basic East Asian policies of the Konoe and Hiranuma cabinets, with the handling of the Sino-Japanese War as the primary goal, while in other aspects of the world, he will base his policies on enhancing friendship with other countries, in order to establish a new independent policy, but only with those countries that recognize Japan's mission to build a new order in East Asia and are willing to cooperate. It is believed that as a result of the rapidly changing international situation, Japan will inevitably be subjected to more external pressure. It is heard that people in the military here have expressed today their desire to see the new cabinet engage in strengthening national mobilization and the powers of the Prime Minister. It is said that the policies supported by the military include the following: (1) Establishing national unity and enhancing the national spirit; (2) Increasing military expenditures, especially to deal with the Soviet Union; (3) Expanding production capacity; (4) More efficient trade controls; (5) Adjusting national economic and social affairs. In addition, military personnel believe that Japan's foreign policy must be based on its policy towards China. It is heard that the military will adjust everything that hinders its work in China and must eliminate it. This morning, the Japanese newspapers all published comments on the resignation of the cabinet and Abe's appointment to form a cabinet. The Asahi Shimbun stated that although the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact was the reason for the collapse of the Hiranuma cabinet, if a more accurate judgment is made, the executioner of the previous cabinet was actually the issue of strengthening the Berlin-Tokyo anti-Comintern axis. The Hiranuma cabinet had decided to adopt a policy of strengthening the anti-Comintern pact between Japan and Germany, which had been submitted to a five-minister conference for deliberation. Unexpectedly, Germany suddenly announced the conclusion of a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, so the thought conference could not but stop its discussion. Hiranuma and his cabinet accepted responsibility for the failure of their policies and resigned. The newspaper expressed its approval of Hiranuma's decision to stop proposing to strengthen the anti-Comintern axis with Germany, believing that he had seen that defending against communism had become one of the main goals of Japan's war against China. The newspaper also praised Hiranuma for leaving the responsibility of formulating a new European policy to his successor. The Hochi Shimbun predicted that Oshima, the Japanese ambassador to Germany, who most strongly supported the anti-Comintern pact and advocated Japan's joining the Axis military alliance, would soon be recalled to the country. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

After General Abe Nobuyuki was ordered to form a cabinet in Tokyo, well-informed political figures declared that the Hiranuma cabinet was forced to resign due to pressure from the military. At the same time, the military will have significant decision-making power in the selection of new cabinet members and the drafting of new government plans. It is said that Minister of the Army Itagaki still enjoys the trust of the military, opposing the inclusion of former Foreign Minister Ugaki, Hirota, former Ambassador to England Yoshida, and Ambassador to France Sato in the cabinet, but agreeing to Ambassador to England Shigemitsu Mamoru's assumption of a cabinet post. In addition, the military also requested more action and fewer meetings to increase the Prime Minister's authority and to quickly end the war against China. (Haitong dispatch, 29th)

(London) The Daily Telegraph today published an editorial on the resignation of the Japanese cabinet, stating that regardless of who is chosen for the new cabinet, one thing can be said for certain: trusting in Germany's promises is no longer their creed. Moreover, under the current circumstances, reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Japan is a distant prospect. The Italian guarantee given to Foreign Minister Arita, adjusting Italy's attitude towards Japan so that it will not change due to Germany's actions, is sure to be accepted by Japan. However, from Japan's perspective, the anti-Comintern pact is equivalent to being shattered, and this guarantee has no deep impact. The newspaper concluded that Japanese politicians will be motivated by a new concept in the future and will seek friendship outside their own borders. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

### Three Prominent Figures of the Ministry of Finance All Enter the Cabinet

Japanese Financial and Industrial Circles Hold High Expectations for Aoki

(Tokyo) The new Minister of Finance in the Abe Cabinet has finally been appointed: Aoki Kazuo, President of the Planning Board. The so-called three prominent figures of the Ministry of Finance are Kaya, Ishiwatari, and Aoki. Now, with the formation of this new cabinet, all three gentlemen are simultaneously appointed as ministers, which is indeed a beautiful thing. Mr. Aoki hails from Nagano Prefecture. After graduating from the Law Department of Tokyo Imperial University in Taisho 5 (1916), he immediately took a position in the Ministry of Finance. In Showa 11 (1936), he transferred to the Director-General of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau and Vice-President of the Planning Board. When the Hiranuma Cabinet was established in January of this year, he was promoted to President. With the birth of this new cabinet organization, he was immediately appointed as Minister of Finance. (29th Dispatch from the Allied News Agency)

(Tokyo) Regarding the expectations of the financial circles for the new Minister of Finance, they are listed below. After the formation of this new cabinet, what the financial and industrial circles here expect from the new Minister of Finance is the establishment of a Japanese-Manchukuo-China economic system and the adjustment of external economic relations. In general, the implementation of Japan's wartime economic policy is based on established principles that any Minister of Finance can clearly put into practice. However, regarding the crucial issue of how to smoothly navigate the complex and eventful wartime economic policies of today, many believe that the new Minister of Finance Aoki, as a long-time expert in financial administration, along with Kaya and Ishiwatari, are known as the three strongmen of the Ministry of Finance. Later, Mr. Aoki served as Director-General of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau and President of the Planning Board, implementing reforms such as expanding the currency and stimulating production in North and Central China. Part of this expertise is suitable for the new East Asian economic construction. Now, after the major tax system reform, the calculation of the next fiscal year's budget is very urgent. Furthermore, there are complex and diverse international financial situations, such as the outbreak of the European War, which need to be addressed. How the new Minister of Finance will demonstrate his abilities is something we are paying close attention to. It is also hoped that government and the private sector will cooperate to prevent any drastic changes in the financial world. What the industrial circles expect from the new Minister of Finance is the establishment of a solid goal, a willingness to adapt policies as much as possible, and cooperation with those with will and drive. However, Mr. Aoki is generally recognized here as an authority on financial adjustment policies. Moreover, since assuming the presidency of the Planning Board, he has been striving to coordinate wartime economic operations and formulate mobilization plans for goods, and he is presumably well-versed in the industrial field. The industrial world places great emphasis on the so-called suitability of the new Minister of Finance upon assuming office. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be significant changes to Ishiwatari's financial policies after the appointment of the new Minister of Finance Aoki. Nevertheless, the new Minister of Finance has a thorough understanding of trade and exchange rate policies, so he will strive for new and active initiatives in export trade. The issue of establishing a Ministry of Trade will become more concrete. (29th Dispatch from the Allied News Agency)

(London) Japanese sources in London claim that there is currently no confirmed information regarding the rumor that Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Shigemitsu Aoi, will be transferred to become the new Foreign Minister. Although Shigemitsu Aoi is a suitable candidate, the former Foreign Minister Sato Naotake is also one of the candidates for this position and is currently in Tokyo. If Shigemitsu Aoi returns to his home country to take up the new position, it will take several weeks to conclude the affairs of the embassy and return to Tokyo. They believe that the position of the resident ambassador in London is crucial in Japan's future policies, so it is more appropriate for Shigemitsu Aoi to remain in office in the UK because Shigemitsu Aoi is generally recognized as one of Japan's most capable diplomats and is welcomed in London. According to the general opinion of the Japanese in the UK, Japan must maintain neutrality in the European war. Currently, Shigemitsu Aoi is constantly communicating with Tokyo, and his advice is an important factor in formulating Japan's new foreign policy. (9th Dispatch from Reuters)

### Brief Biography of the New Army Minister, General Hata

(Tokyo) The new Army Minister, General Hata Shunroku (61 years old), is from the Tohoku region. He graduated from the 12th class of the Army Officer Academy, specializing in artillery. His family was poor. General Hata had a deceased elder brother, Eitaro, who was also an Army General. During his lifetime, he and General Hata were an honorable pair of Army Generals. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, General Hata served as the supreme commander of the Central China Front, and he wore the military sword left by his deceased brother to show that he would not forget his late brother's will. This is sufficient evidence of the harmony and affection between the two brothers. Furthermore, among the graduates of the Officer Academy in the same class as the General were the current Supreme Commander of the North China Front, General Sugiyama Moto, and former Colonial Minister Koiso. His classmates at the Prefectural First Middle School included former Minister of Justice Shiono and Professor Ikeuchi Hiroshi of Tokyo Imperial University. The General is a modern military officer who can endure hardship, is considerate, and has a clear mind. This spring, he established distinguished military achievements in Central China. After returning to his home country, he was appointed as Aide-de-Camp to the Emperor on May 25th. (19th Dispatch from the Allied News Agency)

### Brief Biography of the New Minister of Justice, Mr. Miyagi

(Tokyo) Mr. Miyagi Chogoro (62 years old), who has been appointed as the new Minister of Justice in the new cabinet, is a prominent figure in the Japanese prosecution world. From Showa 7 (1932) to 9 (1934), he handled a series of earth-shattering cases, such as the May 15th Incident, the God Sent Troops Incident, the Black Riot Group Incident, the Japanese People's Incident, and the Tokyo City Council Scandal. These major cases are worthy of the world's memory. Furthermore, Mr. Miyagi and Shiono, the Minister of Justice from a purely judicial background, and Chao Yuan Nei, etc., graduated from the Law Department of Tokyo University in Meiji 39 (1906) in the same class. (29th Dispatch from the Allied News Agency)

### Japan Secretly Sends Overtures to Britain and the United States, Still Using Anti-Communism as a Pretext

(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun published an article today, stating that if Germany can continue to show cooperation in Japan's establishment of a new order in East Asia, then Japan will be able to enhance its friendly relations with Germany from a completely new standpoint. Japan's opposition to the Communist Party remains unchanged, and defending against communism is the greatest objective of our war against China. It is an inconceivable fantasy to suddenly change its policy towards the Soviet Union and immediately cooperate with the Soviet Union. Therefore, Japan's policy towards the Soviet Union is unlikely to change course for the time being. If Britain can proceed with everything according to the methods agreed upon by Foreign Minister Arita and Ambassador Craigie and agree to cooperate with Japan, then Japan is prepared to conduct negotiations with Britain. Everything will depend on the extent to which Britain recognizes the reality of the Far East. As for the recent policies of the United States, there are many aspects that are regrettable. If the United States can correct its attitude towards Japan, then the friendship between the two countries may be maintained. (29th Dispatch from Reuters)

### Britain Reassures China Again that Its Far East Policy Remains Unchanged

Guo Taiqi and Shigemitsu Separately Visit the British Foreign Secretary. The Two Meet in a Room but Remain Silent.

(London) British Foreign Secretary Halifax assured Chinese Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi yesterday that Britain's Far East policy will not change due to European disputes or the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. It is said that Mr. Guo explained to Foreign Secretary Halifax that what China has been striving for in the Far East in the past two years is no different from what Britain is trying to do in Europe. The goals of both sides are to fight against aggressors. Observers here believe that the Chinese government fears that Japan may become diplomatically isolated after the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, and that Britain may sacrifice China to seek understanding with Japan in the Far East. When Mr. Guo went to the British Foreign Office, he met Japanese Ambassador to the UK Shigemitsu Aoi in the waiting room outside the British Foreign Secretary's office. The two did not greet each other. Foreign Secretary Halifax separately received the ambassadors of China and Japan. The purpose of Shigemitsu Aoi's visit to the British Foreign Secretary has not been announced, but it is generally believed that he was inquiring about the latest developments in the European situation and informing the British Foreign Secretary of the Japanese cabinet reshuffle. (29th Dispatch from the Associated Press)

### British and American Observers' Views on the Japanese Political Situation

(London) The Times commented on the resignation of the Japanese cabinet today, saying that Japan has some reason to feel deceived. Many Japanese must have known long ago that Hitler would abandon Japan when the opportunity was right, but no one expected it to be so sudden. Without the warning of even a day, they were suddenly abandoned, and the beneficiary was their main enemy. Such a fate is certainly not welcome. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's contemptuous allusions when mentioning Moscow and his comments that Japanese-German relations could become even closer are enough to prove the unpleasant truth that Germany not only treats Japan with no courtesy but also regards Japan as a fifth-rate country. This is truly regrettable. But apart from wounded honor, Japan has not lost much and has gained a very valuable lesson. It can now freely plan its own future. However, its future has no ideological connection with Europe and is full of entanglements. Even if the situation in Europe clears up, the new Prime Minister Abe will still have many troubles. But one thing that Abe understands is that British-Japanese relations are very important to Japan. The new Japanese government also knows that there have been no surprising moves, ambiguous attitudes, or double-dealing tactics on the British side. The purpose of British Far East policy is still the same as when the Sino-Japanese War first broke out. Britain wants to have good relations with Japan, the same as it has with other countries such as China. Britain is happy to see the restoration of peace in China, but this must be a just peace. Britain demands that its interests in China be respected and is prepared to protect them. In summary, any improvement in British-Japanese relations is a contribution to peace. If the simple and firm principles of Britain are understood by the Japanese side, then there is nothing in British Far East policy that can prevent the realization of this improvement. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)

(Washington) State Department officials are unwilling to make any criticism of the new cabinet until its personnel and policies are fully understood. However, according to those familiar with current affairs here, the cabinet reshuffle in Japan is due to a change in public opinion within Japan. Many Japanese people believe that the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty has indeed endangered Japan's security. However, some believe that Japan's future international activities are difficult to predict. In general, however, Japan will ease its hostile attitude towards Britain and the United States. This change of attitude is extremely reasonable, both militarily and commercially. After adopting this attitude, if the European war does not break out, then Japan's position in the Far East will not be too unfavorable. If the European war breaks out, then Japan can of course do more business without being resented by the democracies. Another political critic named Laurence argues that the United States should take advantage of Japan's abandonment by Germany to restore friendly relations between the United States and Japan. He means that Japan must accept the Nine-Power Treaty as the basis for resolving the Far East issue. China's territorial integrity must be maintained, but Japan's spheres of influence and economic opportunities in China must also be duly recognized. After the adjustment of US-Japan relations, the US fleet can transfer a portion to the Atlantic to cheer on the democracies. (29th Dispatch from the Associated Press)

(Washington) The Japanese cabinet reshuffle is receiving great attention from the State Department. Undersecretary of State Welles held talks with Ambassador to Japan Grew (currently on leave in the United States). British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay also visited Undersecretary Welles to discuss the situation in Europe and the political situation in Japan. (Ambassador Lindsay is scheduled to return to the UK on the 30th of this month.) Sources close to the State Department said that after the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, the most serious impact has been placed on Japan, which may now form a moderate cabinet and have the possibility of approaching Britain and France. As for the United States, if Japan forms a moderate cabinet and is willing to restore the balance of power in the Far East, then the position of the United States is very good. There is no end to the problems that the United States and Japan can discuss. In addition to concluding a new trade agreement, the "Manchukuo" issue can also be studied. Currently, Japan's policy in China completely contradicts the open-door principle on which US Far East policy is based. Now, if Japan is willing to change course and try to approach the United States, then the US government may act as a "faithful intermediary" and try to bring Japan and Britain and France together. Although this is hypothetical and the future results are difficult to predict, some State Department officials still hope that Japan's attitude will be more moderate, and said that if Japan joins hands with Britain and France, it will be enough to offset the impact of the Soviet Union's change of attitude in Europe.

### Japan Still Deploys Heavy Troops on the Border. Hong Kong Authorities Remain Vigilant. Rumors of British Troop Withdrawal Are Not True. Schools Are Requisitioned as Field Hospitals, with Roofs Painted with Markings to Prevent Air Raids.

(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong government is under orders to prepare for contingencies. The Great Hall of Hong Kong University and other parts have been requisitioned and converted into field hospitals. King's College and Queen's College will also be converted into temporary hospitals if necessary. The authorities have also selected small islands near Hong Kong as evacuation areas for refugees, which will be well-equipped and managed. All public and private hospitals have large red crosses painted on their roofs to prevent air raids. The situation on the Sino-British border is gradually stabilizing. Japanese troops are withdrawing between Shenzhen and Nantou. There are approximately 8,000 Japanese troops in Shenzhen, Nantou, Shatoujiao, Huangsongshan, and other places. British troops in the New Territories have also begun to withdraw their defenses, and more than 100 British vehicles have carried military supplies back to Hong Kong. (29th Exclusive Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Today, I inspected the British border and found that only a portion of the Japanese troops withdrew yesterday. I heard that the eight transport ships loading Japanese soldiers in Taishan Bay are all small Japanese ships, each carrying only a few hundred soldiers. Heavy troops are still stationed on the border, but patrols have been reduced, and large groups of Japanese soldiers are not commonly seen. (29th Dispatch from Reuters)

(Hong Kong) A very small number of British expatriates have returned to the Fanling border area. The authorities have denied the rumors of British troop withdrawal. (29th Exclusive Dispatch)

### Chinese Troops Once Charged into Zengcheng

Wengyuan: The Chinese troops besieging Zengcheng suddenly launched a fierce attack on the Japanese stronghold of Heling in the northern suburbs on the 28th. The Japanese resisted desperately, but were eventually bravely attacked by the Chinese troops, who captured a large number of them. The Japanese abandoned about 100 corpses and retreated to the north bank of the North Gate, confronting the Chinese across the river with artillery fire. Until 3:00 AM this morning, a unit of the Chinese × regiment, under the cover of artillery fire and braving the rain of bullets, swam across the river and charged into the North Gate of Zengcheng, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese for an hour, killing many Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, a large Japanese reinforcements arrived and concentrated their firepower, bombarding the Chinese troops. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the Chinese troops who had entered the North Gate immediately retreated to the high ground in the northern suburbs, where they continued to fight fiercely with the Japanese. (29th Dispatch) Wengyuan: On the morning of the 28th, after a unit of Chinese troops once attacked the North Gate of Zengcheng, they retreated to the nearby suburbs due to the large number of Japanese troops and the small number of Chinese troops, waiting for an opportunity to continue their advance. Currently, the Japanese troops in the four suburbs of Zengcheng are all under intense pressure from the Chinese troops. Furthermore, on the morning of the 29th, the Japanese troops in Fuhe Xu and Datangwei (northwest of Zengcheng) were also being encircled and annihilated by the Chinese troops. (29th Dispatch)

### Under the Moonlight Night, A Large Number of Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing. Divided into Four Squadrons with a Total of Fifty-Four Aircraft. Bombs Dropped in the Western Suburbs Cause Three Fires. In the Air Battle, Two Aircraft Are Shot Down.

(Chongqing) Four squadrons of Japanese aircraft, totaling 54 aircraft, raided Chongqing at 9:00 PM, 9:30 PM, 10:30 PM, and 10:50 PM last night. Immediately after the initial alert, the Japanese aircraft launched their attack, which lasted for an hour and a half. The Japanese aircraft dropped 12 incendiary bombs in the western suburbs of Chongqing, causing three fires, but all were extinguished within five minutes. Because the bombs did not hit the refugee camps, the casualties were minimal. Several bombs fell on the south bank of the Yangtze River, with no loss. Although the moonlight was bright and the target of Chongqing was visible, it was not attacked. Thirty Chinese fighter planes took off to meet the attack and engaged in a heroic air battle with the Japanese aircraft. According to reliable sources, two Japanese aircraft were shot down. (29th Dispatch from the Associated Press)

(Chongqing) On the night of the 28th, Japanese aircraft once again launched a stealth attack on Chongqing. Under the moonlight, a fierce air battle broke out. When the Japanese aircraft invaded in batches, the Chinese air force waited for the opportunity to attack, inflicting heavy damage. One Japanese aircraft was shot down by the Chinese side. After defeating the Japanese aircraft, the Chinese air force returned in formation. The Air Defense Command had previously reported that three batches of Japanese aircraft, numbering about 20, were flying west along the Yangtze River from Hubei, with the intention of attacking Chongqing. The Chinese air defense forces made early preparations. Soon, the first batch of nine Japanese aircraft sneaked into the airspace from the north. Taking advantage of the fact that the Japanese aircraft had come from afar and were illuminated by the lights, the Chinese air force fought bravely. The Chinese artillery units also fired their guns to provide support. The Japanese aircraft did not dare to linger and hurriedly dropped bombs as they passed through the city's airspace before fleeing to the east. Subsequently, at intervals of no more than ten minutes, a second batch of nine aircraft invaded the city's airspace. The Chinese air force soldiers then redoubled their efforts and concentrated their firepower, launching a fierce attack. The Japanese aircraft were heavily pressured by the Chinese side and had little power to resist. Moreover, their formation was quite scattered after being attacked by the Chinese side. At that time, it was seen that the right-wing aircraft in the Japanese aircraft formation was hit by a shell, and white smoke came out of the tail of the aircraft, which fell from the air. Several other aircraft were damaged, and the remaining aircraft knew that they could not compete and fled east across the city's airspace. About an hour later, the third batch of Japanese aircraft still arrived on the outskirts of the city from the original direction. However, by then, white fog was spreading over the river, and it was no longer possible to distinguish the number of incoming aircraft. After circling in the air once, they did not drop bombs and fled in panic. According to a post-incident investigation, the Japanese aircraft in the first and second batches dropped bombs, but they all fell in the barren land in the suburbs, so the Chinese side suffered very little loss. The investigation is ongoing. (28th Dispatch)

(Chongqing) Twenty-seven Japanese bombers, divided into three squadrons, attacked Chongqing at 9:00 PM, 9:15 PM, and 10:30 PM last night, dropping bombs in the western suburbs. Therefore, explosions were barely heard here. The Japanese aircraft encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire each time, and Chinese fighter planes quickly engaged in battle. The alert was lifted at 11:30 PM. (29th Dispatch from Reuters)

(Chongqing) Last night, the Japanese air force took advantage of the moonlit night to continuously bomb Chongqing three times. Each time, there were nine Japanese aircraft dropping bombs in the suburbs of the city. Chinese fighter planes took off to pursue them, and at the same time, anti-aircraft guns fired intensely. The Japanese aircraft fled one after another. The extent of the damage is under investigation. (29th Dispatch from Haitong News Agency)

(Chongqing) The Air Defense Command officially announced today that Chinese fighters shot down at least one Japanese bomber last night, and several other Japanese aircraft were badly damaged and may not be able to fly back to their original defenses. The second squadron of nine Japanese bombers appeared over the city of Chongqing at 11:15 PM, but were chased by Chinese fighters, causing the Japanese formation to break up. One of the aircraft on the far right wing was hit in the tail by machine gun fire and immediately caught fire and fell to the ground. (29th Dispatch from Reuters)

(Chongqing) According to a Chinese military spokesman today, one of the Japanese aircraft was indeed shot down by the Chinese side during last night's air raid, and its wreckage was found on the south bank of the Yangtze River this morning. (29th Dispatch from the Associated Press)

### If War Breaks Out in Europe, China's Foreign Policy Will Remain Unchanged

—Statement from a Senior Official— Close Attention Will Be Paid to the Situation. The Hope for Peace Between China and Japan Is Extremely Slim.

(Chongqing) According to a senior Chinese official speaking to the Associated Press today, if war breaks out in Europe, China's foreign policy will remain unchanged. Because China's greatest task at present is to resist Japan, it is unwilling to pay too much attention to changes in the diplomatic world. However, China will closely monitor the situation so that we can change our actions at any time. Speaking of the Japanese cabinet reshuffle and the impact of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty, a Chinese official told the Associated Press that Japan currently has only three paths to take: (1) Compromise with Britain and the United States; (2) Compromise with the Soviet Union (According to the Soviet side here, the signing of a non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan is in fact impossible); (3) Make peace with China. As for China's established policy, it is that unless the Japanese troops withdraw from China and the Japanese government changes its policy towards China, there is absolutely no possibility of peace talks. In other words, as long as the Japanese troops do not withdraw from China and the Japanese government does not change its policy towards China, China's resistance against Japan will not stop for a single day. According to the official, the hope for peace between China and Japan is still extremely slim at present. Although Japan has changed its cabinet this time, the policy of the new cabinet will still be the policy set before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. Subsequently, the official believed that Japan's flattery towards Britain and the United States (such as automatically easing the blockade of Tianjin and withdrawing the Japanese troops from the Kowloon border) would not achieve anything, because Britain would never make major concessions that would ruin its interests in the Far East.

### German Nationals in Shameen Have Not Received Evacuation Orders

### Observations from Chongqing: Trends in Japanese Diplomacy; Pursuing Amity with Britain and America to Exert Full Effort Against Russian Threat

(Chongqing) According to observations from the Chinese side today, the reason for the resignation of the Hiranuma Cabinet still lies in the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. Japan's diplomatic policy has never utilized the Anti-Comintern Pact to restrain the Soviet Union. After the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact, the effectiveness of Japan using the Anti-Comintern Pact to contain the Soviet Union was completely lost. Therefore, it was necessary to change the cabinet and re-formulate a new diplomatic policy. According to the Chinese side, the collapse of the Konoe Cabinet was due to its inability to end China's resistance after issuing a declaration of peace. As for the resignation of the Hiranuma Cabinet, it was because it could not maintain the core of Japan's diplomatic policy, the Anti-Comintern Pact. According to observations from the Chinese side, Japanese Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu indeed has the possibility of being appointed as the new Foreign Minister, seeking to utilize him for closer relations with Britain and America. However, the Chinese side is determined to respond to this Japanese conspiracy with all its strength. Furthermore, according to observers familiar with current affairs, the Japanese are now planning to transfer a large army to the "Manchukuo" area to prevent large-scale military actions by the Soviet Union. However, according to the Soviet side here, speaking to the Associated Press, the Soviet Union has no intention of attacking Japan. However, rumors that Japan and the Soviet Union will conclude a non-aggression treaty are practically impossible. Some people also believe that the fall of the Hiranuma Cabinet was due to its inability to defeat the Soviet troops at Nomonhan. Therefore, the appointment of the new Minister of the Army will inevitably strengthen its position against the Soviet Union. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

### He Yingqin Reports: Military Overview for the Past Three Months; All Japanese Attempts Have Failed; Combat Capabilities Are Weakening Daily

(Chongqing) Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin reported on the military overview of the past three months at the Central Memorial Week this morning, stating briefly that, in the past three months, apart from the battles in southeastern Shanxi and the area around Minggang in southern Henan, there have not been any very fierce battles in other areas. Other relatively major situations were the Japanese landing in Chaozhou and Shantou, and the landing near Bao'an at the mouth of the Pearl River, and the battle of Shenzhen at the Sino-British border. (1) The battle in southeastern Shanxi: The Japanese in North China attempted to eliminate our troops based in the mountainous areas of southern Shanxi. In mid-May, they exerted all their strength and launched eight attacks on Zhongtiao Mountain in southern Shanxi. After our army bravely counterattacked, by mid-June, the attacking Japanese had been completely defeated. After our army recovered □□ on June 15, the Japanese changed their plan and concentrated troops from southern and central Shanxi, as well as the Pinghan Railway and Daoqing Road, and launched a five-pronged attack on the Taihang Mountains. Their main target was to attack Jincheng, because Jincheng is a very important stronghold in southeastern Shanxi. In July, there were fierce battles in Yangcheng, Qinshui, Changzhi, Licheng, and Linyuan. Although Jincheng was eventually occupied, our army then successively recovered Yangcheng, Qinshui, Changzhi, Licheng, and Qinyuan, constantly cutting off their lines of communication. Because the Japanese were threatened from behind by us, they used the main force of the XX Division to hold Jincheng and part of the XXX Division to hold Changzhi, while the other divisions were transferred back to their original locations. Our army actively launched counterattacks on various fronts and intercepted their outer lines of communication everywhere. Consequently, on August 20, Jincheng was recovered, and on the 13th, Gaoping was recovered. Now they are pursuing and attacking them on all fronts. The Japanese attempts in southeastern Shanxi have been completely shattered by this point. (2) The battle of the Japanese army landing in the Chaozhou and Shantou area: In late June, the Japanese drew troops from Guangdong and, with the cover of naval and air forces, landed in Shantou. Our defending troops resisted fiercely, but because the troops stationed there were relatively weak, Shantou fell. Our army withdrew to the mountainous area northwest of Chao'an according to plan. The purpose of the Japanese attack on Chaozhou and Shantou was to blockade our South China ports. Although a part of our commercial economy has been slightly affected, it is not of great consequence. (3) The battle in the Minggang area of southern Henan: The Japanese in southern Henan and northern Hubei had been lurking for a long time after the failure of the Battle of Suizao in mid-May. In mid-July, when the Japanese in Shanxi Province were carrying out a five-pronged attack on the Taihang Mountains, the Japanese in the Xinyang Changtaiguan area of southern Henan also gathered more than 10,000 infantry and cavalry and harassed the northwest in two directions. Their purpose was to contain our various routes on the south bank of the Yellow River in order to support their attack in central Shanxi. Thus, there was the battle in the Minggang area. On July 24, they invaded Minggang and on the 25th Pingchang, and then divided their troops to invade Qinyang and Tongbai, with one part harassing Queshan to the north. After interception by our forces in Qinyang, Tongbai, and Queshan, they were thwarted. Subsequently, our army launched a planned counterattack, and on August 3, the Japanese north of Minggang were eliminated, and the Japanese retreated south, and Minggang was recovered. (4) The Japanese army landing near Bao'an at the mouth of the Pearl River and the battle near Shenzhen: On the third day of the suspension of the Anglo-Japanese talks, at one o'clock in the morning, more than a thousand Japanese suddenly landed at Nantou, south of Bao'an, at the mouth of the Pearl River, and immediately advanced towards the border between Shenzhen and Kowloon. Shenzhen fell on the afternoon of the 18th. The purpose of the Japanese landing on the Sino-British border was to threaten Britain and make the Tokyo talks easier to concede, and to create the possibility of blockading Hong Kong, which had no particular impact on the Chinese military. As for the battle results we have achieved in the past three months, they have been announced by the responsible authorities at the end of each month and published in the newspapers, so there is no need to repeat them. Looking back on the past two years of the War of Resistance based on the situation in the past three months, we can draw a general observation of the Japanese situation: (1) In terms of military affairs, the Japanese combat power has indeed become weaker day by day. Especially after the Battle of Wuhan, the Japanese offensive power is far from what it used to be. In battles such as Suizao, Zhongtiao Mountain, and Taihang Mountain, not only were they unable to achieve their expected goals, but they also suffered great losses. The reason is very simple. First, the Japanese have lost most of their elite troops after a long period of combat. Most of the replacements are reserve soldiers, and their morale and education are naturally far inferior. Second, the extension of the front line and the expansion of our war zone mean that the Japanese have to allocate some troops to every place, making it impossible to maneuver. The third is the disintegration of military morale. After two years of the war of aggression against China, not only the Japanese people have deeply realized that the Chinese people cannot be conquered, thus brewing anti-war sentiment, but also the lower-ranking Japanese officers and soldiers have developed a sense of weariness, which has led to anti-war behavior. (2) In terms of diplomacy, the Japanese behavior is completely unrighteous and untrustworthy. The invasion of our country is already a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty. After that, they bombed American ships, shot British envoys, and injured British ships in Changsha. The damage to the lives and property of foreigners is countless. The recent blockade of Gulangyu and the Tianjin Concession is intolerable to anyone. We can see from world opinion towards Japan in the past two years that Germany's resolute conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union is a clear recognition that Japan has no strength, so Japan has been completely isolated internationally. If they fail to wake up, they will eventually be abandoned by the world. In addition, the Japanese have another factor of defeat: the corruption of discipline, which has reached an irreparable point. The Japanese have failed in military, diplomatic, and political terms, but they still cannot wake up, so in the past six months, they have used their superior air force to continuously bomb our undefended cities in the rear, attempting to disrupt our rear and strike at the morale of our country. But this is not a manifestation of strong military force, but a reflection of their predicament of having no other choice against us. Taking Chongqing as an example, everyone can see that our people have not reduced their spirit and determination to resist the war because of the bombing. The number of our troops has doubled compared to before the Battle of Wuhan, and the technical skills of war have been greatly improved due to long-term combat experience, so the combat power is several times stronger than before the Battle of Wuhan. These detailed situations have been reported in various aspects in the past, so there is no need to report them again. In short, the Japanese combat power is declining day by day, while we are becoming stronger and stronger. As for the international community, it has moved from spiritual sympathy to practical assistance for our country. Moreover, the unity of the national spirit, the concentration of will, and the belief in a single doctrine and obedience to a single leader are beyond the reach of the Japanese. Therefore, our victory is very predictable. We have been able to lay the foundation for victory and obtain international sympathy and assistance entirely because of the efforts of our entire country, and entirely because we have always respected faith, valued peace, and fought this war of resistance to uphold human justice and peace. It is by no means a fluke. Now, the attainment of our final victory is getting closer day by day. We only hope that our comrades in the front and rear, and our compatriots in the front and rear, will become more united, persevere, and work together to complete the final task of this War of Resistance.

### Southwest Highway: Thriving Transportation

(Chongqing) The Fuxing Trading Company, a Chinese import and export trading company with the United States, will greatly expand its transportation capacity in September because 900 new trucks from the United States will be used entirely for transportation. It is reported that 100 of these new trucks have already started operating in Guangxi, specializing in transporting tung oil to the Annam railway station. It is reported that after all these trucks are in operation, the amount of tung oil transported to the United States each month can reach more than 4,000 tons. At the same time, a large amount of gasoline, machinery, and munitions can be transported in from the United States. After these new trucks are put into use, the number of trucks operated by the Southwest Transportation Company will reach as many as 2,000. The company's manager, the American Grove, and other American truck experts have established the most advanced transportation system in China. The training school established by the company has two branches, and 600 driving talents and technicians have been hired from Singapore and Shanghai as training cadres. Repair shops, refueling stations, warehouses, and dormitories are set up everywhere on the various routes of the Southwest Highway. At the same time, in the past, the life of a truck in wartime was only six months, but in the future, the life of a truck can be extended to two years. It is reported that in addition to transporting tung oil to the United States, Fuxing Trading Company also plans to transport it to the United Kingdom to repay loans, and also to transport it to the Soviet Union to conduct barter trade with the Soviet Union.

### The Netherlands and Switzerland Implement Mobilization: Determined to Strictly Maintain Neutrality; Norway Calls Up Naval Reservists; Belgium Completes the First Step of Mobilization

The Hague The Netherlands mobilized its army and navy, limited to the 15th class. From 3:00 PM today, all passenger cars nationwide will be temporarily suspended and used exclusively for mobilized officers and soldiers.

The Hague Queen Wilhelmina gave a radio speech tonight, stating briefly that our country has decided to defend its neutrality. For the sake of vigilance, the government has taken various mobilization measures this afternoon. This is compelled by the situation and is understood by the people of the country. At this moment, the situation is indeed very serious, but preserving peace is not completely hopeless. As far as the Netherlands is concerned, it is impossible to maintain its neutral position without mobilizing the strength of the entire country. The government is aware of this and has decided to immediately take various active preventive measures to ensure complete safety. But in reality, our country has no reason to be threatened by any party. Our precaution is only because the situation is tense and we have to be careful." The Queen also ordered today that Lieutenant General Landell be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the national army and navy. (Havas telegram, 28th)

Gada, the spokesperson for Rachele, said that even at the last minute, the Prime Minister's policy is still a policy of peace. However, when presenting peace proposals to Mussolini, attention must be paid to the peace proposals previously put forward by Mussolini himself, so as not to contradict them. This means that Mussolini very much wants to convene an international conference, not only to discuss satisfying Germany's demands, but also to discuss Italy's demands. (Associated Press telegram, 29th)

(Rome) The Italian radio station yesterday broadcast a speech commenting on Italy's attitude towards the international situation and expounding on the historical mission of the Axis powers. It said briefly, "Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly issued calls for a peaceful resolution of international disputes based on the principles of rights and justice. At this moment, with the threat of war imminent, the Italian Prime Minister has not given up hope for a peaceful resolution. If the other party still speaks of re-establishing mutual trust, then we should answer that the Treaty of Versailles must be abolished before it can make amends for the facts. The Italian Prime Minister has devoted himself to the cause of peace for seventeen years. In order to seek world peace and justice, as far as the merits and demerits of the Axis countries are concerned, the Axis countries have worked hard to save the European crisis." (Haitong telegram, 29th)

(Rome) Italy is now anxiously awaiting the outcome of the exchange of documents between Britain and Germany. The people have not shown any warlike spirit and unanimously hope to preserve peace. This is the most prominent feature of the current crisis. All newspapers are saying that Mussolini is now working hard to maintain peace. The Postal News published an article by Battano, saying that Italy will first consider its own interests. The lesson that Versailles cannot be forgotten makes Italy have to carefully consider the move to rashly participate in the war. Peace is above all else, but if all attempts to maintain peace fail, Italy will not hesitate to abide by its statements. (Reuters telegram, 28th)

(Rome) The Roman People's Daily has been confiscated by the authorities because it had a large-character headline on the front page that said, "War?" (Havas telegram, 29th)

### Slovakia: German Troops Enter; Plan to Attack Poland on Three Routes

Bratislava The government announced today, stating briefly that German troops have now entered the territory of Slovakia and have been ordered to defend Slovakia when necessary. (Reuters telegram, 29th)

(London) The London Times recently published a telegram from a correspondent in Bratislava, claiming that Slovak Prime Minister Tiso said yesterday that since the state is a protectorate of Germany, it should be prepared to "fight alongside" it. The correspondent also said that the German troops concentrated near the border between the state and Poland are divided into three routes. The first route plans to attack along the Vah River, the second route plans to attack along the Civalong Highway, and the third route plans to attack along the Presov Highway. The task of the Slovak troops seems to be to cover the rear of the German troops or to defend the areas near Hungary. The state is now stepping up the anti-Polish movement. All propaganda slogans are the same as those used by Germany. Residents in various places have held demonstrations many times, demanding the recovery of the cities ceded to Poland last September. Incidents have also occurred near the city of Katowice, when a team of Polish soldiers mistakenly entered the Slovak border and were immediately detained by German troops. A Polish officer was also killed. (Havas telegram, 29th)

### British Newspapers Advocate: Exchange of Nationals; To Resolve the German-Polish Dispute

(London) The Times published an article today, saying that the German claim of a lack of living space is actually nothing more than a new German method of conquest. If Poland's treatment of the German minority is indeed a genuine pain, then this is merely a simple matter of moving this minority of Germans into Germany. The exchange of populations is a method of making political and ethnic boundaries suitable for each other. It has been carried out elsewhere in Europe and has been effective. This move can eliminate the source of this pain forever, but the excuse of pain is to seek strength, and the need for frequent trends is to coerce Poland, or to recognize this solution as unwelcome. The News Chronicle also made the same suggestion, saying that if Hitler is prepared to discuss the exchange of populations to solve the minority problem, as France and Turkey have already done and Italy is currently trying in the South Tyrol province, then this is indeed a proposal that can be discussed and is part of a general solution. (Reuters telegram, 29th)

### US Authorities Closely Monitor: International Situation, Discover; Prepare to Convene an Extraordinary Congress When Necessary; Isolationists Gradually Tend to Abolish Neutrality Law

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull gave a speech to reporters today, stating briefly that he could not disclose the situation in Europe and the Far East, but its development is being closely monitored by the State Department, and reports are being received constantly. It is rumored that the US government intends to convene a meeting of the American republics in accordance with the resolutions of the successive Pan-American Conferences and issue a final appeal to European countries, but in fact, this is not the case, but any head of a Latin American republic who can follow in the footsteps of President Roosevelt and issue the same statement is welcome. In addition, reports that the US government intends to appeal to Stalin for peace are also unknown to official sources. (Havas telegram, 28th)

(Washington) The White House has drafted a message, which will be signed by President Roosevelt as soon as it is certain that European war is inevitable, to immediately convene Congress to hold an extraordinary session. At that time, Congress should support the President and decide to aid Britain and France to the greatest possible extent. White House officials even said that Congress may go even further than maintaining "friendly neutrality" towards Britain and France. Although President Roosevelt does not intend to require the people to "maintain neutrality in speech and thought, as President Wilson did in 1914, he is determined to maintain lasting peace for the United States. (Havas telegram, 28th)

(New York) According to a Washington dispatch from the New York Post, the leaders of the isolationist factions of the Republican and Democratic parties, who previously struck down President Roosevelt's neutrality bill in Congress, have now decided to change their resolution when war breaks out. It is said that they do not want newspapers to announce their names. They have recently announced to people that they have changed their point of view because they now believe that the people of the whole country want them to make this change. If war breaks out, they will vote in favor of abolishing the current neutrality law. After examining the situation, they feel that there will be no difficulty in abolishing the current neutrality law. (Reuters telegram, 29th)

### Soviet Conference Discusses New Conscription Law, German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact Approval Unlikely to Be a Problem

(Moscow) According to official sources here, the rumor that the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact has already been approved is incorrect. This issue is the third item on the agenda of the current Supreme Soviet meeting, and only the first item was discussed yesterday. It is expected that approval will not be possible until tomorrow at the earliest. (Haitong Telegraph, 29th)

(Moscow) The Supreme Soviet meeting was held today. Discussion of the ratification of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty will have to wait two or three days. The new Conscription Law and the Agricultural Tax Law will be put to a vote first. According to the current Conscription Law, the term of military service is already very long. In the army, infantry service is fixed at three years, and after the expiry of that term, soldiers continue to participate in military training for two years. The term of service for other arms, such as cavalry and artillery, is even longer. In the navy, the term of service for new recruits is uniformly fixed at five years. It has been rumored that the term of military service stipulated in the new Conscription Law will be extended for some time, but it turns out that this is not the case. The term of military service will remain the same. After the establishment of the new Conscription Law, the number of young men enlisted nationwide will be higher than it is now, because under the current Conscription Law, only one-third of new recruits at all levels are enlisted. In addition, young people across the country who have been deprived of their political rights by the government were originally exempt from military service, but from this year onwards, they will also be enlisted for six months. (Havas Telegraph, 28th)

(London) According to a correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" in Moscow, the impression among foreigners in Moscow is that the reason why the ratification of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Agreement was listed as the last item on the agenda of yesterday's Supreme Soviet meeting is that if war breaks out and the agreement has not yet been ratified, the Soviet Union will reconsider its position if it deems it convenient. Yesterday, the Supreme Soviet unanimously passed a three-point agenda, the third point of which was the ratification of the new German-Soviet Agreement. The meeting lasted only five minutes. (Reuters Telegraph, 29th)

### Details of German-Soviet Trade Agreement Announced

(Berlin) The details of the German-Soviet trade agreement were disclosed for the first time yesterday. The main points are as follows: (1) Germany will lend the Soviet Union 200 million marks, of which only 120 million marks will be used in the first year. (2) German goods exported to Russia include factory equipment, mining equipment, chemical industry machinery, and electrical equipment. (3) Soviet goods exported to Germany include agricultural and forestry products, raw materials, and petroleum. (4) Current trade is not included. (Haitong Telegraph, 29th)

### Panorama of India: Night Flights Banned

Simla: Flights are prohibited near the defense zones of Karachi, Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras from today onwards. Night flights are prohibited throughout India. (Reuters Telegraph, 29th)

### Sweden and Finland Withdraw from the Gold Pound Group

(London) The Treasury has ordered a ban on the trading of various overseas securities on the stock exchange, which has been met with satisfaction. According to stock exchange personnel, this is a good strategy for maintaining the pound. Today, the price of gold in London reached a new peak of 161 shillings per ounce, an increase of six shillings compared to yesterday. This is a natural result of the continued strength of the US dollar. (Reuters Telegraph, 28th)

Stockholm: Sweden has now decided to withdraw from the sterling bloc, lowering the exchange rate of the pound from 19.4 kronor to 17.9 kronor. The Swedish krona is no longer linked to the British monetary system. After the government adopted this new measure, banks stopped exchanging pounds for Swedish kronor. It is believed that the value of the pound will fall again. At the same time, hotels here are also refusing to accept pounds, causing some British tourists to be unable to cash their pounds or pay their hotel bills to return home. (Haitong Telegraph, 29th)

Helsinki: The Finnish National Bank today abandoned its link to the gold pound and set the exchange rate for the Finnish currency at 210 marks to one British gold pound. The previous exchange rate for the gold pound was 217 Finnish marks. (Associated Press Telegraph, 29th)

### Diplomatic Maneuvering by France and Poland: London Dispatch

— Uncle Di

According to information, since the establishment of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Germany's attitude towards Poland has become increasingly tough. This letter was sent more than ten days before the announcement of the agreement. The situation in Europe is very different from today, so the letter contains statements such as "The Danzig problem has suddenly eased in the past two days and has largely retreated to an inconspicuous position." However, its contents are still worth reading. - Editor -

In recent days, the situation in Europe has been changing rapidly. The proper diplomatic maneuvering by France and Poland is indeed one of the biggest factors in stabilizing the situation in Europe in the short term. These two countries may be placed together in many ways, but in their recent diplomatic maneuvering, we can see a common point. What is this common point? Undoubtedly, it is the same direction that runs counter to the "Chamberlain Cabinet Line."

We all know a public military secret, which is that the goal of the British Air Force's expansion since last year is to reach the same level as Germany between the end of December this year and the beginning of January next year; France, for its part, will reach the same level as Italy during the same period. The German and Italian authorities are of course perfectly clear about this. If Germany and Italy really want to risk starting a war with Britain and France, then the best time would be at the beginning of this year. Therefore, after Dr. Schacht's economic negotiations with Britain failed, the general view at the time was that it was the most dangerous period. In particular, Nazi strategists have always believed in quick-win battles, so the biggest worry at the time was that Hitler might suddenly launch his combat apparatus at any time and rush straight at Britain and France. Later, the crisis was finally overcome safely. Since then, time has moved forward, and along with it, the massive expansion of British and French armaments; and becoming inversely proportional is the danger of war. Expanding our horizons a little further, in the Far East, the difference in strength between China and Japan is changing significantly. And Russia and the United States, which are much more powerful than Germany, Japan, and Italy combined, are standing on this side.

Even today, it would be a lie to say that Britain and France, if they are faithful to the anti-aggression front, are in danger of being directly attacked by Germany, Japan, and Italy. The real danger to the heart of the anti-aggression front is the "Chamberlain Cabinet Line." This "line" has the potential to dismantle the anti-aggression front itself, and therefore also has the potential to threaten world peace; and in the current short-term phase, it has placed the survival of the British and French empires in a most dangerous situation.

Therefore, while Britain is currently united in monitoring Prime Minister Chamberlain and his ilk, the proper diplomatic maneuvering by France and Poland in recent days deserves to be pointed out.

First, France. After the Munich Conference last year, France's position in the European diplomatic arena fell to that of a second-rate country. For a year, her diplomacy has also been that of a second-rate country. And now, on the eve of this major crisis in Europe, general observers are once again estimating that if Daladier still follows Chamberlain this time, then the result will be that France's diplomatic position will fall again to that of a third-rate country. Therefore, everyone is worried about France's future. But recently, we have suddenly seen several very powerful steps by Daladier, which is really a cause for great joy. That is: first, the British-French-Soviet alliance issue. As soon as the British Parliament adjourned, he immediately recalled Strang, who had been in Moscow for two months; and then, he extended the departure date of the military delegation as much as possible. This was originally a plan that Chamberlain and his ilk had arranged long ago. Therefore, on the night of the adjournment of Parliament, the British government leaked the news that the military delegation might be delayed, the reason being that they needed to exchange views and information in detail with the French representatives first. But everyone knows that the French delegation had already been appointed. Moreover, France's views had been notified to Britain long before the British delegation was appointed. This move by the British government was clearly intended to delay. But because Parliament had already adjourned, British public opinion lost its most powerful support, and everyone was very anxious. Fortunately, France stepped forward. She directly sent a delegation to Britain for face-to-face talks, and then detoured to Russia. Now this group of British and French military representatives is finally on its way, although it was originally intended to fly directly to Moscow, it has now been changed to travel by ship, first detouring to Leningrad, resulting in a total delay of a week. Even now, as I write this dispatch, the current British government is still not sincere about the establishment of the British-French-Soviet alliance; otherwise, it should have stopped the "Tokyo negotiations" with Japan and the secret contacts with Germany long ago. At this time, we can only place a large part of our hope for future success on the diplomatic maneuvering of France. Second, regarding the Far East. France is willing to do its utmost to support the steps taken by Britain in the Far East, which is obvious to all. However, perhaps because it was too subservient to Chamberlain's policy, it also praised the purely humiliating diplomacy of "Tokyo style" in a vague way. Some French newspapers even said that it was a very clever move, because Britain and France were fortunately not fooled by Hitler and distracted by the Far East, neglecting the European situation. Then, after the British Parliament decided on the adjournment date, at the last meeting, Chamberlain openly declared that Britain in the Far East had no choice but to submit; because: (1) Britain was standing there alone, and the United States and France did not intervene; (2) If it was to be tough, it would have to send a battleship immediately, but under the current tense situation in Europe, it could not spare one at all. At this time, France took another powerful step. She immediately guaranteed to the British government that if Britain thought it necessary to send a battleship, it could be transferred from the fleet stationed in the Atlantic; as for the vacated Atlantic defense, France could send a ship to supplement it. Moreover, the French naval authorities believe that in the near future, Germany and Italy will absolutely not be able to threaten the Atlantic defenses of Britain and France. As soon as this news came out, the hearts of the British people were immediately cheered up. However, now, Prime Minister Chamberlain's plan to build a battleship seems to have been shelved again. Even so, this move by France has made Chamberlain's face even clearer and should have eliminated one of his most powerful excuses. Third, it is a contribution to the formation of the anti-aggression group. Although on the surface, British diplomacy is acting alone towards Poland, Turkey, and other countries, we know that on the other hand, France's diplomatic role in promoting it is actually no less than that of Britain. The loans and land concessions to Turkey have long been regarded by everyone as wise moves. And recently, when Finance Minister Simon deliberately delayed the issue of loans to Poland not long ago, France immediately expressed its willingness to cooperate and urged it. France is willing to lend a considerable amount of money to Poland to expand its armaments. This move, when compared with the sacrifices of allies such as Czechoslovakia and Spain, cannot help but make you feel the great difference between French diplomacy in the past and the present. As a result of this move, the partial establishment of the British-Polish loan was promoted.

Not long ago, I mentioned the mission of France in today's evolution of the international situation. Now we have seen these recent French diplomatic measures. From this, I think we can roughly infer the future direction of French diplomacy. The term of office of the Daladier cabinet has been extended for another term, and French diplomacy will be in his hands in the next two or three years. If it can be strengthened in this way and remain unchanged, then it is really a blessing for the anti-aggression front.

Next, let's talk about Poland.

Let's not talk about the previous diplomatic achievements; the success of Poland's diplomatic maneuvering this time is indeed too noteworthy. The period in which the events occurred was within the ten days of early August. At that time, we all knew that in Italy, there were large-scale demonstrations and exercises in the Po River basin; in Germany, there had been the mobilization of more than one million troops; and inside Danzig, there were 60,000 armed forces preparing to take action. In such an environment, Hitler suddenly summoned the Nazi leader of Danzig, putting on the same posture as he did for the Sudetenland last year. At the same time, Germany and Poland began a propaganda war, filling Europe with dark clouds. In Britain, some people were even worried about being dragged into the war and began to complain about Foreign Secretary Halifax's move to form an alliance with Poland.

But at this time, Poland did something even more surprising; it issued an ultimatum to the Danzig parliament, setting a deadline of the 5th to withdraw the order prohibiting Polish inspectors from exercising their powers on the East Prussian border. At this time, everyone thought she was taking too much of a risk! Because the measures of the Danzig parliament at that time were initiated by Hitler himself, and even for the sake of his personal authority, it would be difficult for Hitler to give in. But then, in the second step, Poland gathered two divisions of troops on the border, claiming that it was preparing to attack Danzig. Until the end, the Danzig parliament finally surrendered; and this was also Hitler's surrender! This is indeed a major gain for Polish diplomacy; greatly exceeding the expectations of the general public, especially the expectations of the current British government.

Her secret to success lies in strictly closing the door to mediation and intervention by third parties in advance.

Therefore, the so-called Danzig problem, which had been brewing for several months, has suddenly eased in the past two days and has largely retreated to an inconspicuous position. Therefore, Foreign Minister Ciano is again planning to meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, probably the most important thing is to discuss how to step down on the Danzig issue. Hitler is still doing "military diplomacy" and does not intend to launch a major war immediately.

Poland's victory is a major blow to the "Chamberlain Cabinet Line"; it has deprived it of a gift to ingratiate itself with Germany, and it is also a major warning to it that Germany can buffer with Poland if Britain and France do not promote the anti-aggression front as soon as possible.

In addition to the Danzig issue, everyone's attention is now focused on Hungary and Yugoslavia. (Sent on August 11)

### Japanese Army Attempts to Open Up Fujian and Guangdong

Japanese Army Greatly Reinforces Shantou and Chaozhou, Corresponding to the Japanese Army on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway

Shantou Correspondence: After the Japanese army in Guangzhou invaded Baoan, it successively increased its troops, attempting to invade Huiyang along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and then sweep through Chaozhou and Meizhou from Huiyang, connecting Zhangzhou and Xiamen in southern Fujian, in order to open up Fujian and Guangdong. Therefore, the Japanese army in Chaozhou and Shantou has also been greatly increased since the 16th, in order to correspond. Half of the troops increased were from the Taiwanese army and more than 5,000 puppet restoration troops transferred from a certain place. Combined with the original Japanese army, there are now more than 10,000 troops. According to investigations, the battles in eastern Guangdong have been stalemated on the Anjie Road for more than a month. The Japanese army has suffered heavy losses. If it is not greatly reinforced, it is feared that even the strongholds on the railway stations cannot be guaranteed. Now, only on the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway line, traces of the Chinese army are found every day. Since the 17th, the Japanese army has only fired randomly from a long distance. On the evening of the 17th, a certain battalion of the Huazhen Middle Brigade of the Chinese army rushed into Fuyang Station and destroyed the platform. In this battle, more than 40 Japanese soldiers were killed and more than 30 feet of railway tracks were dug up. It was not until 2:00 a.m. the next morning that they retreated to their original positions. On the 18th, the Japanese army immediately transferred 200 troops from Shantou to reinforce Chaoan. On the 19th, they divided into two routes and advanced towards Fengxi, Fengling, and Yunti Mountain, one departing from Chaoan County and the other heading north from Anbu and Caitang, with tanks and cavalry as the vanguard. The Chinese army used hand grenades and machine guns to fight back at Niaoyang Mountain and Yunti Mountain. The Japanese army could not break into Anjie Road. On the 20th, they were still fighting fiercely. On the 19th, there were two Japanese destroyers in Shantou Port, one Japanese cruiser outside Mayu Kou, and four other transport ships. More than 30 steamships were moored in the port. Every day, more than a dozen ships sailed inland to loot livestock and food. On the afternoon of the same day, four armored fishing boats and speedboats, carrying more than 200 Japanese soldiers, sailed from Mayao Dianxi Island into Shantou, transporting a lot of military equipment and forcing the people to help them unload and land. These armored ships are equivalent to shallow-water submarines. Looking at their intentions, they have a plan to invade Jieyang from the waterway. Therefore, according to general observations, when the Japanese army on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is in a tight battle to spy on Huiyang, there must be a fierce battle in Jieyang.

### Sino-Foreign Exchange Rate Used to Set Rice Prices, Approval for Purchase of £10,000 Worth of Gold, Yu Hede and Others Petition for Relief of People's Food Shortage, President Kong Replies Approving and Exempting Taxes

The Municipal Council Issued a Public Notice Yesterday Stating that Rice Prices Will Gradually Decline

(Chongqing, 29th) Shanghai's situation has become extremely serious due to Japanese and puppet obstruction of transportation and rice-snatching riots. Yu Hede, Li Ming, Xu Jiqing, and others jointly telegraphed President Kong on the 24th, requesting relief. President Kong, concerned about the people's food shortage in Shanghai, immediately approved the purchase of £10,000 worth of gold, to be used by various Shanghai organizations to jointly order 20,000 shi of Saigon rice, to be rushed to Shanghai for emergency relief. The incoming and outgoing telegrams are recorded as follows:

Telegram from Yu Hede and Others

To Your Excellency President Kong:

The Shanghai citizens are experiencing a severe food panic due to obstructed transport of domestic rice and difficulty in purchasing foreign rice due to black market restrictions. Investigations reveal that the total rice reserves in the entire foreign concessions are only about 80,000 bags, making the situation extremely precarious. Even at the inflated price of thirty-five yuan per shi for foreign rice and thirty-eight yuan for domestic rice, there is nowhere to buy it. The people are bewildered and greatly concerned. Moreover, the concessions are sheltering over 80,000 refugees, making food provision even more difficult. We, therefore, request your Excellency to consider the people's hardship and approve the application for £10,000 worth of gold at the Sino-Foreign exchange rate to pay for the 20,000 shi of Saigon rice to provide relief. Awaiting your orders,

Yu Hede, Li Ming, Xu Jiqing, respectfully.

President Kong's Reply Telegram

To Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Li Fusun, and Mr. Xu Jiqing of Shanghai:

Your respectful telegram is acknowledged. This year, Jiangzhe areas have had bumper harvests. We were concerned about farmers suffering from low grain prices and the inability to transport domestic rice to Shanghai for sale due to transport obstructions. Furthermore, Jiangzhe hinterland has been disrupted, and the number of people seeking refuge in Shanghai is increasing daily. Coupled with sheltering over 80,000 refugees, the population increase has led to insufficient rice supply, with prices rising to over thirty-five yuan per shi and nowhere to buy it. The people's food shortage is deeply distressing. Your request to purchase £10,000 worth of gold at the Sino-Foreign exchange rate for various organizations to jointly order 20,000 shi of Saigon rice is approved. It is hoped that it will be rushed to Shanghai for emergency relief. Special exemption from import duties is granted to reduce rice prices and benefit the common people. In addition to instructing the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee and the Chief of Customs, this urgent telegram is being sent for your information. Kong Xiangxi.

The Municipal Council Issued a Public Notice Yesterday

Yesterday, the Municipal Council issued a public notice stating that domestic rice has been continuously shipped to Shanghai in recent days, and the quantity is sufficient for normal consumption. Rice prices have already decreased. Although the current selling price is still too high and unsatisfactory, further price reductions are expected in the near future. Regarding the rice issue, the Municipal Council is conducting important negotiations and considering various optional plans, and it is inconvenient to explain the Council's position to the outside world at any time. In the past few weeks, the Council has been deeply concerned about the state of rice supply. This issue has been continuously discussed by the Council's directors and staff, and a Food Supply Committee has been specifically established to handle it. The chairman of the committee is Sir Victor Sassoon. As for the rumors that there is a certain amount of rice in storage that can be arbitrarily disposed of by the Council at any time, this is completely inaccurate. Furthermore, it is said that the recent rice shortage is due to hoarding by certain private individuals in the Public Concession. According to the results of the Council's investigation, this statement is also inconsistent with the facts. Daily reports are made on the quantity of rice in the Public Concession, and the Council carefully verifies the amount of rice stored in each warehouse at any time. The French Concession authorities are fully cooperating with the Council on the rice issue.

Dredging Supply Routes is of Paramount Importance

The Municipal Council shipped rice from Saigon to Shanghai in 1937, but the environment at that time was different from the present. If the Council purchased and shipped a large amount of foreign rice at the current foreign exchange rate for the long-term use of the residents of this city, it would inevitably run the risk of significant economic losses. Moreover, after the rice panic occurred, the Council has always believed that it is necessary to dredge the supply routes from the hinterland in order to achieve a truly practical solution to this problem.

Serious Situation Significantly Improved

Therefore, the Municipal Council has expressed its views to the Japanese authorities, requesting them to facilitate the transportation of rice from the areas controlled by the Japanese side to Shanghai. The Council's views have been sympathetically considered by the Japanese side, and as a result, the serious situation has been significantly improved. After the rice panic occurred, the Council has been in contact with any group or individual who can assist in transporting rice to Shanghai at all times. The Council is very grateful for the cooperation from all parties. The sharp rise in rice prices has naturally had the greatest impact on Chinese residents of lower social classes. Therefore, the Chinese directors of the Council should pay special attention to this. A certain Chinese director has found a way to raise funds for the purchase of 1,800 tons of Saigon rice to meet the urgent needs of refugees and poorer residents.

First Batch of Foreign Rice Shipped to Shanghai

It is also reported that Mr. Yu Zhiqing, a leader in the Shanghai business community, previously considered that the rice reserves in Shanghai were insufficient and the supply from the hinterland was obstructed, resulting in a sharp rise in rice prices, which had a very serious impact on the livelihood of the common people. In order to reduce the panic over food and stabilize the general public, he adopted expedient measures and proposed ordering foreign rice to provide relief. He first ordered 18,000 bags from abroad, and all the rice funds were raised by Mr. Yu. According to a reporter from Da Guang News Agency, the first batch of foreign rice was loaded onto a Norwegian merchant ship yesterday and shipped from Saigon. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai before the 10th of next month. As for the foreign rice recently ordered by various groups, the procurement will continue. In terms of funds, 300,000 yuan has been raised. If necessary, the initiators Yu Qiaqing and others will raise 1 million yuan to replenish the reserves and curb the price of domestic rice.

Domestic Rice Pours In, Public Sentiment Stabilizes

It is also reported by a reporter from Da Guang News Agency that the Municipal Council has negotiated with the Japanese military authorities to dredge the source of domestic rice in order to maintain the people's food supply. It is said that the Japanese side has agreed, so the source of domestic rice has been smooth in recent days. Yesterday, 15 boats arrived at the river, totaling more than 2,300 bags. At the same time, a large amount of rice will also be shipped from Wuhu to Shanghai, so the public's sentiment has become more stable. In the market, because foreign rice is about to arrive in Shanghai and the source of domestic rice is pouring in, prices are unanimously expected to fall. Hoarders are taking the opportunity to sell, but buyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and are unwilling to purchase easily, resulting in a sluggish market. Most hoarders are suffering.

Rice Prices Expected to Continue to Fall

Yesterday's rice market行情 was weak due to oversupply and sluggish trading, so prices fell again. Newly harvested Xian rice plummeted by three to four yuan, with the best quality selling for twenty-five to twenty-seven yuan. Top-quality white粳 rice fell by three yuan, selling for thirty yuan per shi. The highest-priced包子 rice was only thirty-four yuan, a drop of more than ten yuan from its peak. Glutinous rice fell by two yuan, estimated at about thirty-seven or thirty-eight yuan. According to people in the rice industry, given the current state of the rice market, rice prices are expected to continue to fall. At most in a few days, rice prices may fall close to the limit price.

Canadian Trade Commissioner to Hong Kong Transferred to Shanghai

French Chief of Staff Returns Home

According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, Mr. Duke Porth, the Canadian government's Trade Commissioner in Hong Kong, has been transferred to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of October to take office. According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, Captain 巴志, the Chief of Staff of the French military headquarters in Shanghai, recently returned to his country on the Aramis.

### The Typhoon Shifted Direction and Invaded Shanghai Last Night, the Wind Was Extremely Strong But Moved Very Slowly, its Outward Movement Has Lost Freedom

The Xujiahui Observatory reported: (1) At 6:00 a.m. yesterday, the typhoon had reached 29.30 degrees east longitude and 124.30 degrees north latitude. The direction had changed from northwest to west-northwest. The wind force in the center was 60 nautical miles, but the wind was very strong. It is now 180 nautical miles from Shanghai, and Shanghai may be attacked. (2) The 4:00 p.m. report stated that the typhoon had reached 30.30 degrees east longitude and 123.30 degrees north latitude. The direction was still west-northwest, the wind force center was about 30 nautical miles, and it was still strong, but the progress was very slow. Also, yesterday afternoon, the wind force at the mouth of the Yangtze River was seven, and the wind force at Xujiahui in Shanghai was six. The wind force in the center of the typhoon is more than this, so the wind is still very strong.

Wind Direction Changed, Shanghai Under Attack

Observations at 6:00 p.m. the night before showed that the typhoon was heading northwest, so Shanghai would not be attacked and would pass north of Shanghai. Since the direction changed to west-northwest, Shanghai may be attacked. The direction remained the same last night and was attacked after 10:00 p.m. There have been strong winds and showers since yesterday, and the weather has turned very cool. The Zhoushan Islands area has already been attacked by the typhoon, and it is expected that the Wusong Chongming area has also been attacked.

Wind and Rain Disturbance

Since the day before yesterday, this city has been disturbed by the typhoon wing, with strong winds and heavy rain. The wind and rain continued all night. The wind was very strong yesterday. The Huangpu River was extremely quiet because ships stopped entering and leaving, and only ferries were still operating. There were few pedestrians on the road. Also, the Huangpu River had high tides starting at zero o'clock yesterday afternoon. Jiangxi Road, Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road, Yinhua Street, Guangxi Road, Gansu Road, Fuxu Road, and Sapo Sai Road were all flooded with tidal water, and the road surface was all flooded. Also, due to the influence of the wind, the river water on the Bund overflowed the bank.

High Tides on the Huangpu River Deserve Attention

During this period of typhoon attacking Shanghai, the Huangpu River has high tides. Yesterday's morning tide was eleven feet two inches, the afternoon tide was ten feet zero four and six minutes. Today's morning tide is eleven feet eight inches, the afternoon tide is eleven feet zero two inches. Tomorrow's morning tide is twelve feet one inch, the afternoon tide is eleven feet two inches and four minutes. The highest of the morning and afternoon tides from the 1st to the 4th is eleven feet seven and a half inches, and the lowest is nine feet eight inches.

Although the Wind is Strong, the Movement is Not Fast

According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, according to the Customs Signal Station's report at 11:00 a.m. this morning (the 29th), the possibility of the typhoon attacking or approaching Shanghai has been greatly reduced. The report stated that at 6:00 a.m. this morning, the typhoon turned 30 miles north from its previous location. At that time, the center of the typhoon was within 60 miles of 29.50 degrees north latitude and 124.50 degrees east longitude, 180 miles southeast of Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs flagpole flew two black balls this morning, indicating that the typhoon was heading towards Shanghai. At 11:00 a.m., one ball was removed, indicating that the danger had decreased. The signal station received a radio message from the President Harrison, which was arriving in Shanghai, just after 9:00 a.m. this morning, stating that the ship was 90 miles north of the typhoon center and there were no strong winds nearby. A similar radio message was sent by a Japanese freighter sailing to Taiwan in the same area. Based on this news, it is generally believed that although the typhoon's wind force is strong, its movement is slower than before, and the wind is heading north-northwest towards the Shandong Peninsula.

Wind Tightened Again Starting Yesterday Afternoon

The day before yesterday (the 28th), there was news that this city would be attacked by a typhoon, so the customs hung a black ball during the day and changed it to two red lights at night, warning ships not to sail out of the harbor to avoid danger. This morning, two black balls were still hanging high on the flagpole on the roof of the customs clock tower, indicating that the typhoon had not yet passed. However, at about 11:00 a.m., there was news that the wind had changed direction. At that time, the wind had indeed weakened slightly, and the customs removed one black ball. At about 1:00 p.m., a report was received that the typhoon was about to arrive in Shanghai again, so the removed black ball was immediately re-hung, and the wind gradually tightened. Ships in the Huangpu River originally planned to set sail, but then stopped again.

Ocean Liners' Actions Have Been Obstructed

There were no ships arriving in the morning yesterday. Departing ships included the American mail ship President Cleveland, which set sail back to the United States at 7:00 a.m. yesterday, and the French mail ship Aramis, which departed back to Europe at about 10:00 a.m. However, there is no confirmation whether the two mail ships sailed out of the mouth of the Yangtze River yesterday or anchored in the mouth of the Yangtze River to avoid the wind. At about 1:00 p.m. yesterday, one ship named Dalian (transliteration) arrived, and at about 5:00 p.m., the Japanese ship Shintaiko Maru arrived. The British company's mail ship Kasaki, originally scheduled to depart at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to return to London, was temporarily stopped due to the typhoon in Shanghai. It will depart as soon as the wind weakens. The Italian ship Ruliangaisha, which was originally scheduled to return to Venice from Shanghai today, was said by the company yesterday that it was uncertain whether it could set sail on time today due to the typhoon. It will depend on the wind conditions. Also, the American Shipping Company's President Pierce, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the United States at noon today and stop at buoys 12 and 13, has no confirmation yet whether it can arrive today. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong and Jiangsu ships, which were supposed to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday, have been changed to arrive today and tomorrow respectively due to the typhoon. The Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Dingsheng and Tonghe ships, which were supposed to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, have also been changed to arrive today. The departing Guisheng and Lisheng ships have been postponed for two days. It is also uncertain whether the Taikoo Company's Beiyang class Hunan and Nanhua class Qingyuan ships can depart today.

### National Salvation Bonds Pay Interest, Bank of China Telegraphed Chongqing for Instructions, Reconstruction Bonds to be Discounted and Paid from Tomorrow, Railway Construction Bonds Default on Principal Repayment

The National Debt Fund Management Committee, in order to maintain creditworthiness, will allow the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture to discount and pay tariff-guaranteed domestic debts. Reconstruction bonds will be discounted and paid from tomorrow. The payment of interest on national salvation bonds has been telegraphed to the Chongqing head office for instructions. Railway construction bonds will default on principal repayment. The details are as follows:

National Salvation Bond Interest Payment Requires Instructions from Head Office: The National Government, in order to encourage the people to concentrate their financial resources and fill the national salvation expenses, issued 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds on September 1, 1937, stipulating an annual interest rate of 4%. Interest is paid once a year at the end of August, starting in 1938. The first interest payment was fully paid by the Central Bank at the end of August last year. The second interest payment, according to the regulations, is on the 31st of this month, totaling 20 million yuan in national currency. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank telegraphed the Chongqing head office yesterday morning to request instructions on the method of paying interest on national salvation bonds. It will be followed as soon as the head office replies. It is expected that the reply telegram will arrive in Shanghai today.

Reconstruction Bonds Discounted and Paid: The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank received a notice from the head office that the seventh principal and interest payment of the 25th year reconstruction bonds, guaranteed by tariffs and due on August 31, will be allowed to be discounted and paid by the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture in accordance with the unified bond method. The bank and its entrusted China and Communications banks will start discounting and paying from tomorrow. All bondholders should first fill out an application form for discounting principal and interest of tariff-guaranteed domestic debts, and the bank will issue a temporary receipt, which will be exchanged for a "discount certificate" in the future. Shanghai will pay in six installments, each installment being one month, and will be paid by汇劃票據.

Railway Construction Bonds Default on Principal Repayment: The third phase of railway construction bonds managed by the Ministry of Communications, the first and second issues, were each 40 million yuan in national currency. The regulations stipulate that the principal and interest payment dates are the end of February and the end of August each year. The fund is also managed by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. Since February 1939, the third principal and interest of the first issue and the second principal and interest of the second issue have only paid interest and defaulted on principal repayment. This time, the fourth principal and interest of the first issue and the third principal and interest of the second issue, which are due at the end of August, will only pay interest and default on principal repayment. The National Debt Fund Committee has requested instructions from the Ministry of Communications, and will follow them after receiving a reply telegram.

### Resumption of Navigation of German Ships on Shanghai-Ningbo Line is a Temporary Measure, Future Definite Actions will Depend on European Situation

After the German merchant ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line received a notice from the German Consulate on the 26th, ordering them to suspend navigation immediately, the Haiford of Reiss & Co. stopped sailing to Zhenhai. Yesterday, a special envoy of Reiss & Co. went to the German Consulate to request instructions on navigation matters, and the consulate allowed the resumption of navigation of German ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line on a temporary basis. However, the definite actions in the future will still depend on the tightness of the European situation. Also, after the fall of Dinghai County, the local residents have flocked to neighboring islands to seek refuge. The residents of Qingji Island, located between Dinghai and Zhenhai, are particularly numerous and urgently need to take ships to Shanghai. It is known that the EWO has dispatched the Lima to operate between Shanghai and Jintang to facilitate travelers. Haiford did not sail yesterday due to the typhoon. However, requesting landlords to extend rent increase 本埠, a joint association of Chinese and Western tenants in some apartments organized the Shanghai Tenants Association, which issued an open letter to Shanghai landlords yesterday, stating briefly that the association originally scheduled a mass meeting on the 23rd of this month, which was postponed due to the serious international situation, but does not intend to wait until the situation is clear to hold the meeting. It is now requested that the landlords consider postponing the rent increase request. If the landlords accept this request, the tenants will definitely feel relieved and will improve the increasing tension between landlords and tenants.

### Diplomatic Community in Shanghai Remains Optimistic About European Situation, Believes that Hitler's Allowing Continued Negotiations is an Exciting Factor

According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, it was learned today (the 29th) that the diplomatic community in Shanghai remains optimistic, because it is said that the European situation has improved as a result of the meeting between German leader Hitler and British Ambassador Henderson in Berlin last night. The diplomatic community also said that Hitler is now negotiating under the threat of force. Although Germany's urgent preparations for war are a "bad omen," no matter what the situation of the meeting is, Hitler's continued negotiations are an exciting factor. It is rumored that Hitler is somewhat disappointed in the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, because it is now rumored that the Soviet Union only concluded this pact with Germany because it is weak and unable to fight in Europe, rather than having any active friendship with Germany. There is a brighter prospect for the relationship between Japan and the Western democracies. This is another reason for optimism. It is said that Tokyo is forming a moderate cabinet, and Japan has an image of renewing relations with the Western democracies.

### Polish Government Appoints 巴斯德 as Chargé d'Affaires to China, 魏登濤 Summoned to Return to Ministry to Serve, Deeply Regrets Ill Health Prevents Trip to Chongqing to Say Goodbye

Polish Minister to China 魏登濤, who came to China as Chargé d'Affaires in 1919, signed the Sino-Polish Commercial Treaty with former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting. In 1934, he was promoted to Minister. Up to this year, he has been in office for ten years. Due to old age and illness, 魏氏 has long been tired of his duties. Recently, he was ordered by the government to transfer to the Ministry to serve. He has decided to return to his country on the Japanese Empress of the Changxing Company on the 3rd of next month. His successor has been appointed by the Polish government as 巴斯德 as Chargé d'Affaires, who is expected to arrive in Shanghai to take office on November 1. Before 魏氏 returns and the new appointee arrives, the duties of the embassy will be carried out on his behalf by Bao Hemolizhi, the Consul General in Shanghai. The reporter visited the Polish Embassy in Shanghai yesterday morning. The details are as follows:

魏氏 is Old, Has Been Ill for a Long Time, and Has Just Recovered

魏氏 is over sixty years old. His morality and writings have always been valued by the world. He is proficient in both English and French, and his wife is particularly proficient in French. In addition to his wife, he only has one ten-year-old daughter in Shanghai. In recent years, he suffered from eczema, with spots of skin peeling off. He was treated by both Chinese and Western medicine for a year before he recovered. It is heard that the Chinese doctor is from Qingpu and is Professor Li Ximou of Jinan University. This gentleman used snake gallbladder in medicine to treat him, and it was quite effective. Among the foreign ministers in China who take Chinese medicine for treatment, 魏氏 is probably the first one. Unexpectedly, after the eczema was cured, he suffered from appendicitis and was operated on at Hongen Hospital on July 4. Because he was weak and the weather was hot, it was not appropriate to use a knife to remove the abscess. What could have been cured in two weeks took a month to heal, and he was discharged from the hospital on August 5. 魏氏 was ordered to start his return to his country in mid-August and report to the Ministry in October. Now, because he has just recovered from a long illness and has difficulty walking, he had to delay his trip slightly. It is heard that he will first go to the United States for two months of convalescence and then return to Poland.

The Ministry Urges Him to Come, But He Cannot Overcome the Hardships of Travel

As far as the reporter knows, 魏氏 repeatedly planned to visit Chongqing in the two years after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War to visit the central authorities. This year, Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui repeatedly sent letters to 魏氏 urging him to come, but 魏氏 was unable to make the trip due to his weak health. According to diplomatic practice, when a minister of a country leaves his post and returns to his country, he must go to the seat of the host country's government to say goodbye. 魏氏 deeply regretted that he could not overcome the hardships of travel, so on July 26, he sent a letter to Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui to say goodbye, explaining that he could not go to Chongqing and expressing his apologies. It is heard that the Ministry has replied to Shanghai, extending greetings and farewell remarks. When the reporter arrived at the embassy yesterday morning, 魏氏 had just gotten up and was being examined by a doctor. 魏氏 sent an embassy official to meet the reporter on his behalf. Because the reporter was unable to meet with 魏氏, he asked the person who met him on his behalf to ask 魏氏: "Is Poland determined to resist? Will the European situation become a second Munich Agreement?" 魏氏 expressed very firmly that Poland's "determination to resist aggression" and "determination not to agree to convene a second Munich Conference" are beyond doubt.

### Yu Taosheng's Troops Prepare to Attack Nanhui Datuan

The guerrilla forces of Yu Taosheng, scattered east of the Qinxiao Pond in Nanhui County, Pudong, are now taking advantage of the fact that the Japanese troops in Zhuqiao Town at the end of the Shangchuan Road have been repelled, so there is no need to worry about the north. Therefore, the main force is now advancing towards the Qinxiao Pond, preparing to drive out the Japanese troops in Nanhui City, Datuan Town, which are in a state of isolation. As soon as the deployment is completed, the attack will begin, and the civilians in the city and Datuan will be notified to quickly move to a safe area to avoid being suspected and harmed. Those villagers who are relatively well-off have been moving to the Shanghai urban area along the Pudong coast in recent days. Evacuees have been found in the Dongchang Road area of Pudong. Because they do not have "citizen certificates," they are often detained. It is said that Datuan Nancheng, regardless of the rich or the poor, has been evacuated, leaving only the old and weak. No shops are open on the streets, which is equivalent to a dead city.

### Rescuing Four Chinese in Tianjin: Another Protection Order to be Requested

Petition Expected to be Filed with the British Consulate in Early September; No Immediate Signs of Extradition for the Four Chinese

A Mainland newspaper reports that although the British government has decided to hand over the four suspects in the Tianjin assassination case to the Japanese, the legal firm of Mr. Ellis, the suspects' lawyer in this city, received a telegram yesterday (the 28th) from a lawyer in London stating that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus will be submitted to the British Consulate-General here in early September. Mr. Jones of the Ellis law firm, which is handling this world-renowned case,

emphatically declared

that while the British government seemed to have made a final decision on August 26 regarding the immediate extradition of the suspects, there are still no signs of an imminent handover. The petition for the writ, to be submitted in early September, might coincide with the return to Shanghai of Sir Mose, a judge of the British Consulate-General, and the petition may be heard

twice by Judge Jones.

However, Judge Jones is scheduled to leave Shanghai for vacation soon. It is reported that the London lawyer has obtained written authorization from the four political prisoners. They first petitioned for the writ with the British Consulate-General here in early July, attracting worldwide attention, but both times it was rejected. The suspects' lawyers are now in a race against time, as the prisoners may be extradited at any moment. However, if this case continues, they will appeal to the British Supreme Court if necessary.

### Distribution of Fractional Currency Notes Awaits; Postage Stamps to be Temporarily Used

Central Bank Telegraphs Chongqing to Inquire About Methods for Distributing Fractional Currency Notes; Various Businesses Plan to Temporarily Use Postage Stamps for Market Stability

The Central Bank, upon orders from the Ministry, is issuing fractional currency notes, with an initial batch of 500,000 yuan, entrusted to the American company Yong Ning for printing. Originally scheduled for release on July 22, the issuance was postponed due to the discovery of sample notes in the market. For the sake of caution, the matter was extended, and negotiations were held with the printing company. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank that the branch had telegraphed the head office in Chongqing regarding the discovery of sample notes in the market and other related matters, requesting instructions. Therefore, the date of issuance will depend on the head office's reply to Shanghai before further action can be taken.

Various Businesses Still Hope for Postage Stamps as a Substitute

Since the Central Bank's fractional currency notes were suspended due to the incident, and at the same time, the post office declared its refusal to redeem postage stamps at face value, resulting in the stamps being unusable, various businesses in this city have faced numerous difficulties. In desperation, they hastily issued substitute currency notes. At the time, it was only intended as a temporary emergency measure, but unexpectedly, after several days, it was exploited by unscrupulous individuals who imitated the styles of various businesses and privately printed counterfeit notes, leading to repeated disputes in the market recently, even resulting in fatal incidents. The substitute currency notes issued by the United Dried Seafood Merchants Association have already been recalled due to the emergence of counterfeit notes. Other businesses are also well aware of the dangers and have ceased issuing them. The Chamber of Commerce and various sectors have already notified businesses, explaining the dangers and urging them not to issue any more. It is now known that various businesses in this city, in view of the lack of fractional currency, have suffered significant losses in their operations. If remedial measures are not taken as soon as possible, it will lead to serious consequences. At this critical time, merchants can hardly bear further heavy blows. In addition to requesting the Central Bank to issue fractional currency notes as soon as possible, yesterday, the Southern Goods, Northern Goods, and Tobacco Exchange industries jointly submitted a request to the City Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Exchange industry, requesting them to approach the Postal Bureau and ask it to consider the difficulties of the time and make special accommodations regarding the redemption of postage stamps, or to formulate alternative redemption methods, so that postage stamps can temporarily be used as substitutes to stabilize the market.

Tobacco Exchange Industry Urges Cautious Issuance

Recently, large and small businesses have been independently printing substitute currency notes for circulation in the market. Some are jointly issued by several businesses, while others are issued by individual businesses, in a wide variety of forms. Most are makeshift, using simple written words and adding the business's chop, making them usable. However, because of the inconsistent designs and poor quality of paper, and the number of notes issued is not publicly announced, they are easily exploited by unscrupulous individuals. Citizens who receive these substitute currency notes can only use them to make purchases at the issuing business. Other businesses often refuse to accept them, leading to frequent disputes, especially among tobacco exchange shops. The Tobacco Exchange Industry Association in this city, in addition to submitting a request to the City Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Central Bank to quickly issue fractional currency notes for circulation, has also urged its members to be cautious about issuing makeshift substitute currency notes that are prone to abuse, in order to avoid disputes.

Sexual Health

### Youthful Masturbation: One More Layer of Protection for Health

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

The period of puberty is the time when individuals are most likely to develop a habit of masturbation. In women, although there is mucus, there is no conscious awareness of any sensation. However, like men, nerves sometimes become tense, because their reproductive organs have fully matured and become congested. However, the degree of mental tension does not seem as strong as in men. Women themselves can feel the accumulation of this mucus. Women who have reached a certain age often develop a habit of masturbation if they hear discussions about sex and masturbation. For example, ignorant parents or nannies, in order to stop infants from crying, rub the child's genitals, not knowing the evil consequences this causes. In fact, a child's masturbation habit is often acquired unknowingly, or due to uncleanliness, scabies, or overly tight clothing. If children develop this habit at a very young age, they will masturbate even in front of their parents. Since their parents do not have sufficient knowledge about masturbation, they think it is just a child's matter and let them do as they please. If such children enter school, they cannot get rid of their masturbation habit. There is not a single student in school who does not commit this evil habit. In schools, young men and women who indulge in masturbation will, sooner or later, spread this evil habit throughout the school. During after-school hours, male and female students indulge in extreme lewd talk, and if students are tempted by masturbation or prostitutes, they sometimes fall into the evil path of lust.

If masturbation is not stopped, there is no guarantee of physical and mental health. Masturbation is easy to do and can easily become a habit, causing neurasthenia, spermatorrhea, and premature ejaculation. If it is not stopped and treated quickly, the condition will spread to the whole body, causing symptoms such as pale complexion, muscle wasting, headaches, mental weakness, forgetfulness, and insomnia. Fortunately, modern medicine has invented endocrine therapy that can completely cure this condition. Actively taking "Body-Building Tonic" for men, a strong animal testicle endocrine preparation, can quickly eliminate premature ejaculation and impotence, restore sexual health, and ensure no short-lived effects. At the same time, it invigorates the mind, promotes metabolic function, strengthens muscles, and gives a rosy complexion. This agent is effective in all aspects and can generate sperm and nourish the kidneys in 24 hours. Therefore, its efficacy is the best of all endocrine preparations. "Body-Building Tonic" for women can regulate menstruation and promote fertility.

Modern Medicine

### The Role of Endocrine Glands in the Body

— Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

People communicate with each other, and there must be a way for them to communicate. Similarly, there must be a way for the various tissues and organs in the body to communicate with each other. This way is a special chemical component. This component is produced in a certain organ, circulates in the blood, and when it reaches other tissues and organs, it has a significant impact on their function due to chemical action. Often, the action of organ A affects the action of organs B and C. There is mutual communication between them to maintain the unity and harmony of the body's life functions. The one that can perform this important task is Hormon, also known as endocrine, and the name Hormon comes from the Greek root of "awaken" (Opuaw). The reason why it is also called "endocrine" is that the secretions of most glands are sent out of the body through ducts, such as mammary glands and sweat glands, which secrete outwards, and gastric glands and intestinal glands, which secrete inwards. However, endocrine glands are the opposite. They do not have ducts, and their secretions are mostly sent directly into the inside of the body—that is, into the blood, hence the name. Endocrine glands are called endocrine because endocrine secretion occurs in the blood.

A person's intelligence, the development of sexual function, and our well-being all depend on whether the function of the endocrine system is healthy. Therefore, the importance of the position of the endocrine system can be generally seen.

If the endocrine glands lose their normal function, then problems occur in physical development, such as short lower body, dull nerves, lack of memory, scattered spirit, inability to concentrate, and failure in career. Symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and kidney atrophy are also often caused by disorders of endocrine function. "Body-Building Tonic," invented by Dr. Melen, a leading German endocrinologist, is an authority in endocrine preparations. Taking it can correct disorders of endocrine function and restore it to normal, and all sexual diseases and developmental deficiencies caused by endocrine disorders can be cured.

### Symptoms of Qi Reversal in Lung Disease

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

If patients with lung disease experience symptoms of Qi reversal, the disease is quite dangerous and has undoubtedly entered the third stage of lung disease. Those who cough up blood are even more seriously affected. Therefore, patients must not ignore it. However, according to my experience, as long as patients can rest quietly, consume nutritious foods, and receive medication, there is no one who will not respond with a miraculous effect of revival.

Recently, there was a patient named Zeng Tianyuan, 24 years old, from Wuxi, who had been suffering from lung disease for more than two years. Although he had taken various Chinese and Western medicines, none of them were effective. Last autumn, he was introduced by a friend to my clinic for treatment. After an X-ray examination, it was found that there were one large and one small cavity in his lungs. He was suffering from severe Qi reversal and profuse night sweats. His condition was very critical. I prescribed "Lung-Nourishing Elixir" and instructed him to rest and recuperate. Three months later, his condition had improved significantly, and after another three months of medication, he recovered.

### Cured Case of Spermatorrhea: Spermatorrhea Should Not Be Treated with Inferior Medicine but Should Be Treated with Proper Therapy

— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

A patient named Tang Renji, from Wuxi, 25 years old, (complained) —— at the age of seventeen, he was seduced by bad friends and developed a habit of masturbation, but later he realized the harm and quit. A year later, he went to work in a shop, where he was busy and had no rest all day, so he felt quite tired. Before three months had passed, he suddenly had spermatorrhea in his dreams. At first, it was about once every five or six days, but later it became once every one or two days. He was very flustered, so he read the newspapers and saw that a certain sperm-consolidating pill was being sold. He bought it and took it, and it was indeed effective. He continued to take it for two months, claiming that his spermatorrhea had been completely cured. Unexpectedly, after he stopped taking it, the condition became even worse. During the day when he was working, semen flowed out naturally. He realized that he had been harmed by inferior medicine, etc. (Treatment process) —— Tang Jun's sperm gate was lax, and his endocrine system was deficient. I ordered him to recuperate and prescribed "Nair's Spermatorrhea Pills" and the male testicle essence preparation "Body-Building Tonic" and electric therapy for fifteen minutes every day. After one month of treatment, the spermatorrhea was completely cured. It has been three months now, and the spermatorrhea has never recurred, and his muscles are strong and his body is healthy.

Discussion on Gonorrhea

### The Key to Treating Gonorrhea: Easy or Difficult

— Written by Physician Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

The differences in the treatment of gonorrhea cannot really be spoken of with a single rule. However, within no rule, there is also a certain rule. What is this rule? It is the scientific rule. Any therapy that conforms to scientific rules makes the treatment of gonorrhea easy. However, ordinary doctors are limited by vulgar views, confined to outdated methods, and do not know to take the initiative to change to the latest scientific methods. Then, even if they have rich experience, it is not enough to take. Because experience does not necessarily have value, because sticking to old methods, even if a doctor has a hundred years of experience, it is not at all valuable, and instead may be ridiculed for being outdated. The difficulty of gonorrhea treatment depends on whether the therapy is reasonable, and at the same time, patients should understand the necessity of recuperating. If these two necessary conditions are met, then any stubborn gonorrhea, no matter how fierce, can eventually be controlled. Otherwise, no matter how experienced any doctor is, if they do not pay attention to the progress of the times, do not know how to use scientifically invented effective gonorrhea medicines, and do not instruct patients on the method of recuperation, the results will inevitably be laborious and without success.

I also have twenty years of history, but I do not belittle generally effective therapies. Based on my many years of research, the result of choosing the best and discarding the worst is that, in terms of oral medicine, the most effective gonorrhea medicine is "Kelimunon". This agent is made of a mixture of protein and yellow pigment and has anti-gonococcus and phagocytic effects. All the gonococci in both new and old gonorrhea, as long as they take "Kelimunon", will be destroyed like a dry branch and rotten wood; they will all be quickly cured. I also use the latest German-invented electrostatic therapy and anti-gonorrhea serum, etc., to treat prostatitis, arthritis, seminal vesiculitis, cystitis, etc. in acute and chronic gonorrhea, and the cure is especially fast.

Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, twenty numbers will be given out every day, with a fee of only five dimes per number, and two volumes of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one dollar will be given as a gift.

### Dangerous Conditions for Barge Passengers on Ningbo Ships; Fellow-Provincials Association Requests Proper Improvement Plans

Passenger numbers should be limited, and passengers should not be allowed to scramble onto barges; each ship should have iron ladders to facilitate passengers boarding and disembarking.

The Daguan News Agency reports that the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai is requesting improvements in the methods for barging passengers on Ningbo ships in order to emphasize the importance of life. Yesterday, they sent letters to the shipping departments of the German merchant Lihua Yanghang, Far Eastern Shipping Company, Italian merchant Zhongyi Shipping Company, and Yihua Yanghang, etc. The letter states: "We are writing to inform you that, according to a letter from our fellow-provincials as a whole, since the Moufude, Deping, and Hana ships of the upper month's eighth day have all sailed directly between Shanghai and Ningbo, which has made it convenient for our fellow-provincials, these ships are anchored outside the mouth of Zhenhai,

Barge Transportation of Passengers

Boarding ships via barge at and after 8:00 PM, in times of darkness and rapid tides, transporting elderly, weak, women and children is inherently extremely dangerous. All these shipping companies only know to greedily take on more passengers, and don't have passenger number limits; before the barge transportation, the majority of passengers wait on the wharfs in Ningbo and Zhenhai, and at the time of barging there is no method to maintain order, which allows the passengers to compete and disembark. Strong and powerful men rush ahead to embark first, and the weak remain overnight at the wharfs for five, six, even ten nights and are still unable to embark. Cases of people who

Exhaust their Resources

unable to return are known. Cases of heatstroke and illness, becoming incapacitated are known; the sounds of sobbing and complaints are unbearable to listen to. During the jostling to board the barge, they push against each other, causing luggage to fall into the water, family members become scattered, shouts and screams, it is horrifying to behold. This unnecessary suffering, the shipping companies should take full responsibility for. There is also a portion of passengers trapped in Zhenhai who, fearing that being slightly late to embark, will find the ship full and be denied boarding, hire ferry boats in advance to board the ships before the Deping departs. Unexpectedly, when sailing near the blockade line outside the mouth, the tidal flow is rapid, resulting in the boats striking the ships and capsizing,

Passengers Drown

More than ten people (see the Ningbo Current Affairs Gazette of August 2nd). The creation of this accidental disaster, the shipping companies' methods are inadequate, resulting in it. It is also heard that during the Deping's barge transport, passengers crowded, with two people falling into the sea and losing their lives (see the Current Affairs Gazette). Learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, each shipping company for the passengers' boarding and disembarking methods outside of Zhenhai mouth, it is naturally necessary to have improvement. Your association serves the country and town and is dedicated to pursuing benefits for our fellow provincials, not neglecting any effort.

The association has also turned this into a letter to the various companies, requesting that they adopt and comply with it.

### Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Declares Shutdown; Tianjin Floodwaters Haven't Receded; Passengers and Cargo Quietly Await Disposition

The Tianjin flood has remained extremely severe as of yesterday. The water level in the Japanese Concession has risen to over thirteen feet. The Japanese side estimates that material losses have reached a staggering four hundred million yen. Furthermore, the railway between Tanggu and Tianjin has been washed away by the floodwaters, causing travelers intending to go from Tianjin to Dagu to be stranded. All foreign ships operating on this line have declared a shutdown due to the Hai River's banks being a vast expanse of water and the navigational channels being indistinguishable. Shipping between Shanghai and Tianjin has been completely blocked. The Swatow of the Taikoo Yanghang, originally docked at the mouth of Tanggu, returned on the 27th without carrying any passengers. This ship will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 31st), and the date of its next departure to Tianjin will depend on the situation of the floods in Tianjin. The Shanghai-based Weili Han Shipping Company, Taikoo Yanghang, Hongyun Shipping Bureau, Taichangxiang Shipping Company, and Weitai Shipping Company's Xinan Na, Xinan Fu, Xinxiangtai, Hongshun, Anshui, Taishun, and Shengjing, etc., after sailing from Shanghai to Tianjin one after another, have been temporarily docked at Dagu, Tanggu, and Zizhu Lin, etc., due to being blocked by the floods. The cargo they carry cannot be unloaded. The companies have announced to their customers that they intend to store the goods at the nearby port of Dalian, according to Article 13 of the bill of lading, with all freight charges still borne by the customers. However, the customers mostly advocate transporting the goods back to Shanghai, so negotiations are still underway with the companies' authorities. As of yesterday, no decision has been made. Therefore, each ship is currently docked at Tianjin, quietly awaiting the company's instructions before sailing to Dalian or returning to Shanghai.

### The Chinese Staff of the Zhao Feng Park Murder Case; Four Criminals Sentenced Separately; Hua Yi is Also Transferred to the First Court to Face Charges; Guns and Ammunition Await Verification Before Transferring to the French Police

Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen (aka Qian Xizhen), both from Changzhou, were instigated by their mentor (i.e., the master of the gang) Ren Xiaorong, and persuaded their friend Qin Yuanxing to steal two handguns, over one hundred bullets, and a lighter in the shape of a gun from the residence of their employer, British expatriate Mr. Willington, located at No. 4, Lane 641, Xiafei Road, in the French Concession, on the afternoon of the 16th of this month. They handed them over to Ren's disciple, Ah Gou, to hide them in a room at the Oriental Hotel. Ren, fearing that Qin would reveal the crime afterward,

ordered Chen and Zhou

to lure Qin to the Zhao Feng Park that evening, where they gathered Zhou Wenqing (i.e., Xiezhen's younger brother) and Zhang Xiaoer to strangle his neck with a rope and beat him severely, hoping to silence him by killing him. Qin cried for help, and nearby British soldiers heard the cries and entered the park, capturing Wenqing and Xiaoer. Guoyuan and Xiezhen escaped into the darkness, but were captured by detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station the next day, and the stolen goods were recovered. They were sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. Qin Yuanxing, who was beaten severely, was sent to the hospital for treatment. The French Police, because the gun theft occurred in the French Concession, first took Qin to investigate and sent a separate letter to the First Special Court to transfer

the other four criminals

The details of what happened have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Tingke ordered the four criminals, including Chen Guoyuan, to be brought to court for further trial. The French Police also sent detectives to escort Qin Yuanxing to court to testify and requested that the four criminals be handed over to them for further investigation. Judge Meng first questioned Qin Yuanxing about the circumstances of the attack that night. According to Qin, at three or four o'clock in the afternoon on the 16th, Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen came to the apartment, suggesting a walk in Zhao Feng Park. I arrived at the park with Chen at five o'clock. Xiaoer and Xiezhen arrived at seven o'clock, followed by Wenqing, and we sat down to chat, discussing Jinbao introducing me as a lover. Unexpectedly, Guoyuan suddenly took advantage of the dark night when there were no lights and few people, left his seat and approached me from behind

and strangled my neck tightly with a rope. I immediately cried out, and the other three began to beat me fiercely. By the time the British soldiers arrived, I had already lost consciousness. He denied knowing about the theft of the guns and ammunition from his employer. When questioned, Zhou Wenqing and Zhang Xiaoer only admitted to helping to beat Qin, and said that they did not participate in the rope strangulation. Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen admitted that they used a rope to strangle Qin's neck and ordered Wenqing and Xiaoer to assist in the beating without denying it. However, they claimed that the whole thing was instigated by the runaway mentor Ren Xiaorong, and they dared not disobey his orders, etc. Finally, the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu, based on the facts of the case and the confessions of the defendants, requested that Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen be punished for

premeditated murder.

as well as the evidence is clear for the remaining two defendants. The lawyer Fan Gang then defended each defendant, and Judge Meng immediately ruled that Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen were each sentenced to seven years in prison, and Zhou Wenqing and Zhang Xiaoer were each sentenced to one year and six months in prison. After the sentence was pronounced, the four criminals, along with Qin Yuanxing, were handed over to the personnel from the Second Special District Local Court to be taken back for trial. As for the stolen guns and ammunition, it is said that they must be inspected by the Bureau of Public Works' firearms inspection office before being transferred to the French Police.

### Hua Central Opium Suppression Bureau Intensifies Poisoning, Holds Important Meeting

After the exposure of the corruption case of "Director-General of the Hua Central Opium Suppression Bureau," Zhu Yao, and due to connections seeking a thorough investigation, Zhu became greatly fearful. He first sought assistance from the puppet "Governor of Jiangsu Province," Chen Zemin. Still fearing that he could not maintain his position, he further pleaded with Liang Hongzhi, crying and lamenting. As Zhu was a close relative of Liang, the thorough investigation was temporarily suspended. Therefore, in order to repay the favor, Zhu actively promoted the policy of poisoning. He recently convened an important meeting with the owners of opium paste shops in various counties at the headquarters on North Sichuan Road. He ordered each opium paste shop owner to sell at least a whole number of units each day, divided into upper, middle, and lower grades. The upper grade was required to sell 200 taels per day, the middle grade 100 taels, and the lower grade 50 taels. Those who violated this regulation would have their public sales licenses revoked. The opium paste shop owners expressed difficulties with this coercive policy and requested a reduction, but Zhu refused. It is reported that this resolution will be implemented starting on the first day of the month.

### Finance: British and American Exchange Rates Diverge; British Exchange Rate Once Reached Four Pence; American Dollar Actually Contracted

Yesterday, the market was open as usual after the holiday. The HSBC posted rates showed that the British exchange rate rose by 0.025, reaching 0.035 pence, while the American exchange rate rose by 0.1875, reaching 6.25 yuan. Other rates also generally increased. The British and American exchange rates suggested that the inter-exchange rate between Britain and America had sharply contracted by 0.11 to 0.225 yuan compared to last Saturday. The morning opening showed a British stable and American weak scenario, with the British gold rate at 0.03875 pence and the American exchange rate at only 6.9375 yuan. Later, due to selling pressure from the China Bank and China Merchants Bank, as well as slight sales from Hong Kong Electric and the Japanese Bank, and sluggish buying interest from foreign banks, the market was listless. Subsequently, under selling pressure, the situation hardened, and the rate increased to the 0.04 pence level. However, HSBC had unlimited buying interest at the 0.04 pence British gold rate, so the decline was blocked. Afterwards, China Merchants Bank and others, seeing HSBC's strong buying interest, also started to buy, so the situation slightly softened. As a result, the British rate loosened by 0.0625, while the American rate contracted by 0.1875. The futures market was also very calm, with trends similar to the spot market. Trading in the spot and futures markets was very quiet throughout the day due to large investors remaining on the sidelines.

HSBC Posted Rates Generally Increased

In the morning, the London rate for large amounts recently contracted by 0.09375, and the forward rate decreased by 0.011875 pence. The New York silver price slightly decreased by 0.03625. The London spot gold price surged by 0.106 pounds. The exchange rate between British and American currencies fell by 0.21 yuan, rose by 0.025 yuan against Shanghai, and fell by 0.12 yuan against France. The American exchange rate fell by 0.2025 yuan against British currency, rose by 1.05 yuan against Shanghai, and decreased by 0.001125 yuan against France. All of the above were adjusted according to the exchange rate before customs duties. The Central Bank posted rates remained the same. The morning opening selling price for spot goods was 0.03875 pence for British gold and 6.9375 yuan for the American exchange rate, which was stable for the British rate and tight for the American rate compared to last Saturday. This was due to the continued decline in the exchange rate. After the opening, due to sales from Hong Kong Electric and the China Bank, and poor buying interest from foreign banks, the trend weakened. Hong Kong Electric and the China Bank sold spot British gold to foreign banks such as HSBC and China Banking Corporation at 0.04 pence. Soon, the Japanese Bank also sold spot British gold to a certain bank, still at 0.04 pence. When the HSBC posted rates were announced, the British exchange rate surged by 0.025, the American exchange rate rose by 0.1875, and other exchange rates also increased. After the announcement of the silver balancing tax, the rates were posted as tax-exempt. After this, the situation became very quiet, and the trend was also flat. Hong Kong Electric and the China Bank sold spot American exchange rate at 7 yuan and 7.125 yuan to a certain bank and China Banking Corporation. Later at noon, a certain bank sold September British gold at 0.0375 pence to China Merchants Bank. By the closing at noon, the bank's spot selling price was 0.0396875 pence for British gold and 7.0625 yuan for the American exchange rate, which was 0.0009375 pence higher for the British rate and 0.00125 yuan higher for the American rate compared to the morning opening.

British Gold Stabilized Slightly in the Afternoon

The afternoon situation remained very quiet, and trading was very sluggish. It was reported that Hong Kong Electric resold spot British gold at 0.04 pence and 0.0396875 pence, and spot American exchange rate at 7.0615 yuan to foreign banks such as HSBC. Afterwards, China Merchants Bank and foreign firms bought spot British gold at 0.039375 pence from foreign banks, causing the market to soften slightly. By the closing in the evening, the bank's spot selling price was 0.039375 pence for British gold and 7 yuan for the American exchange rate. The September British gold rate was 0.0365625 pence and the American exchange rate was 6.375 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the spot and September British rates both loosened by 0.000625, while the American rate contracted by 0.001875.

The Hong Kong Exchange Market Was Unstable

Hong Kong, August 29th: The exchange market opened this morning without any telegrams from Shanghai. At 10:00 AM, the market was extremely unstable. The first telegram indicated that the spot British exchange rate was 0.0003125 tighter than yesterday's closing, at 1.290625 yuan, while the spot American exchange rate sharply contracted by 0.08125, at 26.5 yuan.

### British Pure Gold Repeatedly Reached Unprecedented High Prices; Cash Market in Shanghai Inevitably Increased

The 4,000 Yuan Mark Was Once Breached

The situation in the cash market yesterday, which was actively traded in the dark, opened weak in the morning but then rebounded sharply. The market sentiment was firm. After the 4,000 yuan mark was breached, it retreated again. This was because the sentiment was originally weak, and the news that the British gold rate had reached the 0.04 pence level caused strong selling pressure, especially from a certain money exchange business, which sold heavily. In addition, buyers remained on the sidelines, causing the morning opening to fall to a low of 3,930 yuan. Subsequently, retail investors took advantage of the low prices to buy heavily, and Hong Kong investors also showed strong buying interest due to the easing of the situation in the region. Although securities firms tried to sell at that time, they still felt that the supply was insufficient. The price surged to 4,080 yuan. The noon closing retreated to 4,065 yuan. The afternoon opening was still flat. Soon, a certain jewelry store resumed active buying on behalf of Hong Kong investors, and securities firms also turned from sellers to buyers. In addition, the foreign exchange rate slightly softened, causing another leap to a peak of 4,135 yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold firm took advantage of the high prices to cash in, causing a slight decline. The closing price was 4,105 yuan, which was 80 yuan higher than last Saturday. Trading volume throughout the day was about 1,000 taels. Gold jewelry stores also saw prices rise sharply, with prices for Customs Order gold and Chinese-British pure gold surging and reaching unprecedented highs.

Actively Traded Cash Increased by 80 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened low due to weak sentiment and news that the British exchange rate had reached the 0.04 pence level, which caused sellers to rush to the market, especially a certain money exchange business acting on behalf of local investors. The opening was 95 yuan lower than last Saturday, or 140 yuan lower than the off-market price on the previous day. A money exchange business sold 30 taels to a certain gold firm at a price of 3,930 yuan. After the opening, the market sentiment stabilized and there was frequent absorption by brokers who saw the price as cheap. While a certain gold firm still had buying interest, securities firms frequently came to sell, but the demand still exceeded the supply, and the price rose. Soon, it surged by 140 yuan. A money exchange business bought 20 taels from a gold firm at a price of 4,070 yuan. Afterwards, securities firms sold again, and buyers reduced their buying interest, lowering the price by 30 yuan. A securities firm sold 10 taels to a cash firm at 4,040 yuan. At that time, Hong Kong investors strongly supported a certain jewelry store's aggressive buying of more than 200 taels. Although a certain gold firm sold, the trend continued to rise. Soon, it rose by 40 yuan. Jewelry stores sold 20 taels to a money exchange business for 4,080 yuan. Later, jewelry stores frequently sold, and Hong Kong investors stopped buying, causing the price to gradually fall by 40 yuan. Jewelry stores sold 30 taels to a money exchange business at a price of 4,040 yuan. At the time, a certain money exchange business aggressively bought dozens of taels, causing it to rise by 35 yuan. A money exchange business traded 50 taels mutually at 4,075 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm sold 10 taels to a jewelry store, causing the price to fall back by 15 yuan to 4,060 yuan. Then, a cash firm bought 20 taels from a money exchange business for 4,065 yuan, setting the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the first transaction was a mutual trade between money exchange businesses for 10 taels, and the price was still 4,065 yuan. Soon, a certain jewelry store started another buying spree, and securities firms and a certain money exchange business followed suit, and the foreign exchange rate slightly softened, and sellers' intentions were weak, causing it to surge by 70 yuan. A securities firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange business for 4,135 yuan. Later, the wind of rising was thwarted because a certain gold firm liquidated profits, and it fell by 30 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange business for 4,105 yuan, setting the evening closing price. The result was that the active trade rose 80 yuan compared to the holiday before (last Saturday). The price of cash firm's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the actively traded gold, and the current bid gold was 65 yuan lower than the posted gold, and few deals were concluded.

Jewelry Gold Posted at 415 Yuan

The exchange rate of gold jewelry per tael also turned from falling to rising. Datong Trading Company was at 9.5 yuan, which was 405 yuan. At 9:45, it rose 5 yuan, and at 2:30 PM, it rose another 5 yuan, reaching 415 yuan. Xintong Trading Company initially fell to 403 yuan, then rose back to 413 yuan (the take-back price was about 20 yuan lower), all rising by 5 yuan.

British Pure Gold Rose Again by 6 Shillings

The Central Bank posted rates showed that the Customs Order gold surged violently, soaring by 0.172 yuan, reaching an unprecedented peak of 2.601 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price surged by 85.4 yuan, exceeding the 1,300 yuan mark, reaching 1,309.2 yuan. The Chinese pure gold buying price rose accordingly, reaching 1,313.9 yuan. This was because during the Confucius birthday holiday, the European situation became increasingly critical. World War II was about to break out, causing great shock in the London market. The British pound lacked support and was extremely weak. All parties were selling off British pounds and buying pure gold as much as possible, resulting in a surge of 0.46 pounds on the 26th and a further surge of 0.6 pounds on the 28th. The two days totaled 1.06 pounds (or 126 pence), rising to an unprecedented peak of 8.1 pounds.

Silver Prices Sharply Contracted: London, August 28th - The silver market suddenly moved in the opposite direction, falling sharply. Indian and speculative merchants sold, and there was a lack of support, causing the recent rate to sharply contract by 0.09375 and the forward rate to contract by 0.010625, both retreating to around the 0.19 pence level. After the market closed, the situation stabilized. A few buyers quoted the posted price. A telegram from New York stated that the American silver spot price was still falling sharply by 0.013625, retreating to 0.36125. A telegram from Mumbai stated that the Indian silver spot and October rates both contracted by 0.03 rupees, while the September rate contracted by 0.01 rupees. A total of 100 contracts were traded, and the market situation was calm.

Discount Rate Fell Slightly

Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts and bills of exchange fell slightly, hovering around 177.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan throughout the day, without significant fluctuations. It fell by 2.5 yuan compared to last Saturday. The money industry association's call rate remained unchanged, posting 0.18 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.

British and Australian Gold Tickets Rebounded

Yesterday, foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds were first weak and then firm, but the results were not stable. Although the British gold ticket exchange rate loosened again, there was hope for peace in the current situation. The market sentiment was optimistic, and the market situation was firm and bullish. There was not much demand for American gold tickets, and the posted rate was slightly higher, and the market situation was slightly loose. Hong Kong tickets rebounded due to the easing of the border situation and stable public sentiment, and the market price rebounded. Singapore and Annam tickets did not see demand and all turned downward. Australian remaining tickets fell too violently last week, and now peace has not been completely abandoned, and the market situation is firm and rebounding. Japanese gold tickets were first weak and then firm, and the results were not very glorious. The evening market was 1.165 yuan. Korean tickets are scarce and the market is very popular. The evening market was 1.05 yuan. Yesterday's market price was British gold ticket up 2 yuan, American gold ticket down 0.05 yuan, Hong Kong ticket up 0.2 yuan, Singapore Cai down 0.1 yuan, Annam ticket down 0.2 yuan, Han gold ticket up 5 yuan, and other currencies were not changed.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Sound of Bidding Prices Filled the Market; The Decline in Cotton Yarn Continued

Double Horse Plummeted by 45 Yuan

The yarn market is weakening, and the decline is fierce. This is because actual sales were weak. Hong Kong investors depreciated the Hong Kong dollar. Moreover, Guang investors absorbed a large amount, resulting in a stalemate in the market. The Hong Kong investors first removed their own goods and rushed to install them to avoid losses. Therefore, they did not intend to try to buy the goods of the yarn companies. As a result, the chips were loose, and those who shouted to sell came one after another. The past mutual high bids have changed into everyone pressing down and rushing to make a first offer. Therefore, the decline of Double Horse was the most tragic. In fact, it is the cycle of heaven. Such an increase is like such a decrease. The price of 210 thread Double Horse plummeted by 45 yuan compared to the previous day.

The opening situation of the current yarn market in the morning was poor. Because the Japanese cabinet resigned and the black market for foreign exchange loosened significantly, colleagues gathered to observe the situation and moved slowly. It did not open until 9:05 AM, because of the lack of actual sales. Later, the opening price fell by 30 yuan. The factory price of Double Horse was 595 yuan, and the spot price was 670 yuan, a drop of 35 yuan. Afterwards, there were still no sales, and it fell another 9 yuan. The factory price rose slightly by a few yuan due to purchases from colleagues, reaching 600 yuan. It was found that the half-day transaction statistics were only 714 bales. The market prices were Double Horse down 43 yuan, Heavenly Girl down 34 yuan, and Two Earths down 20 yuan. Today, 35 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 10 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 30 pieces were shipped to Haikou. The amount purchased by each investor is listed on the left.

### Sagging Yarn Prices Make the Cotton Market Even Quieter

Current cotton trading remains quiet. Factories need to clear their inventory, mainly because yarn prices continue to fall significantly by thirty to forty yuan. Manufacturers have no interest in high-priced raw materials. Furthermore, new cotton from various regions is continuously entering the market, but transportation to Shanghai remains difficult. Prices at the origin are relatively cheaper. The supply from northern Jiangsu continues smoothly, with 446 bales arriving in Tongzhou. Regarding spot cotton, only the Japanese-owned Dakang Factory imported 200 pieces of "Dala" cotton, priced at 132 yuan, with payment in banknotes made directly to the factory.

In other news, regarding Shanghai's foreign cotton trading, factories' enthusiasm is low due to the recent slump in yarn prices, so no deals have been reported. Recently, the price of pure gold in London has soared, and the customs gold unit has also risen from 3.396 yuan to 2.60 yuan, equivalent to an increase of over 0.5 yuan per picul of raw cotton. There are rumors in the market that customs duties will increase starting in September, so cotton merchants are generally unwilling to sell at low prices.

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market opened with a drop due to a telegram from Bombay, leading to the liquidation of long positions. U.S. stock prices were weak due to the tense situation in Europe, significantly impacting the New York cotton market. Speculators were aggressively selling. Yesterday's market price remained weak throughout the day, and the closing price was over 20 points lower than the previous day. However, all European cotton markets rose. India, including forecasts, rose by over one rupee, Egypt rose by over 20 points, and Liverpool rose by over one point.

### New Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cotton Enters the Market

Special dispatch: New "Yao" cotton from Zhejiang has already entered the market in large quantities. Due to the suspension of German merchant ships, it should arrive in Shanghai soon. In areas such as Taicang and Jiading along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the weather has been favorable this year, and new cotton is growing vigorously, so it has entered the market earlier than in previous years. The local selling price there is 85 yuan, and sales have already begun.

### Piece Goods: Restrictions on Imports to the Interior, Reduction of Cloth Sales Tax

Domestic Cloth

Since the National Government gradually strengthened the management of trade and foreign exchange, cotton cloth imported from Shanghai to the interior has been subject to strict restrictions, such as lowering selling prices, raising exchange rates, and implementing a procurement permit system. As a result, various merchant guilds face operating difficulties, and sales have sharply declined. According to news from the Ningbo guild, there is talk of an additional tax of two yuan per piece (calculated at 40 yards) starting on September 1st. Merchant guilds have little interest in purchasing and stockpiling cloth, and there is a willingness to sell off goods with the market. The market shows signs of softening, but factory costs are increasing daily. It is unlikely that the market will continue to decline. Yesterday, white and colored cloths were generally weak, with opening prices largely unchanged. However, small amounts of hand goods were resold by merchant guilds, resulting in price reductions of 0.1 to 0.5 yuan per piece. Selling prices were chaotic. Over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, and velvet were traded on this street. The Ningbo guild handled sixty to seventy boxes of colored twill, blue cloth, serge, and broadcloth. The Guangdong guild handled over 2,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, undyed cloth, and yarn. The Sichuan, Yunnan, and Southeast Asian guilds only added small amounts of goods. Wholesale business in this street's stores and in the guerrilla areas of the interior has uniformly declined.

Eastern Piece Goods

The white cloth market continues to soften, with fine cloth falling another 0.1 to 0.15 yuan per piece. The current price of "Dragon Head" fine cloth is 17.60 yuan. However, "Flying Fish" 12-pound fine cloth was collected by buyers on this street, with over 100 bales traded, rising from 16.95 yuan to 17.10 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands uniformly declined. Fine twill is relatively firm. Brands such as "Blue Double Fish" and "Baby" are continuously needed by dye factories on this street, so the price is stable.

Exports

Piece goods scheduled for export today include 70 pieces to Hong Kong, 30 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 7 pieces to Haikou, 3 pieces to Beihai, and 15 pieces to Xiamen. However, whether they can be exported at that time depends on the wind conditions.

### Grain: New and Old Grain Arrive in Large Quantities, Rice Prices Plummet, Merchants Sell Off at a Loss, High-Quality Indica Rice Opens at 35 Yuan

"Du" Rice: Since the influx of new grain from various regions caused prices to plummet, they have fallen by about 7 yuan from the highest prices. If the inflow of new grain continues unabated, the market may continue to decline. Yesterday, although only Songjiang No. 6 rice arrived from the riverine areas, over 10,000 bags of new and old grain of various grades arrived from the "cartwheel" and "baozi" regions, causing further market anxiety. Most people are struggling. Stores on this street are watching from the sidelines, and brokers are also standing by, resulting in a stagnant situation. Generally, merchants are unanimously and aggressively selling off their goods in an attempt to quickly get rid of them, but it is still difficult to attract interest. As a result, high-quality japonica rice fell by more than 3 yuan, and ordinary early and late season rice fell by more than 4 yuan. The price reduction for old and new "Jian" rice was particularly severe, with the lowest reaching 9 yuan. However, the total volume of transactions in the city was less than 3,000 to 4,000 bags. High-quality Xixi japonica rice traded at 35 yuan, 34 yuan, and Sutong-Kun japonica rice traded at 34 yuan, down to 32 yuan. Riverine early and late season rice traded at 30 yuan, 29 yuan, and original bags traded at 30 yuan, 31.5 yuan. Old "Lu Jian" traded at 30 yuan, 29.5 yuan, new "Chuan Jian" traded at 28 yuan, and lower grades traded at 25 yuan. "Bian Yuan" traded at 30 yuan, 29 yuan, and "Yin Yuan" traded at 25 yuan. Old "Yang Jian" traded at 32 yuan, and new "Yang Jian" traded at 28 yuan, 27 yuan. "Tuan Jian" traded at 29 yuan, 28 yuan, and "Du Jian" traded at 27 yuan. 100 bags of "Cha" rice are being shipped to Xiamen today.

Customer Indica Rice: Yesterday's supply was particularly abundant, with 7,000 to 8,000 bags of new and old indica rice arriving from northern Jiangsu, Wuhu, and Nanjing. There are rumors that restrictions are gradually easing, and the flow of goods has not been as repeatedly blocked as it was a few days ago. Furthermore, it is rumored that grain merchants' requests to transport large quantities of rice have been approved. Market sentiment is unanimously downward, and the newly arrived indica rice from northern Jiangsu is particularly eager to be sold off at reduced prices. Yesterday's high-end rice traded at only 28.5 yuan, with mid-range prices ranging from 27 yuan to 25 yuan. High-end Beijing indica traded at 31 yuan, and Wuhu indica traded at 30 yuan, with lower grades trading at around 26 yuan, a decline of 3 to 4 yuan compared to the previous market.

### Returned Flour Continues to Weaken, Lower Than Factory Prices by 0.2 Yuan, Wheat Prices Fall, Sales Increase

Flour: Yesterday's spot flour market continued to show signs of softening. Although factory prices remained stable, returned goods gradually weakened. Currently, they are 0.1 yuan lower than factory prices. Scattered buyers in the interior slightly absorbed flour at low prices, but actual sales on this street sharply declined due to the drop in rice prices. As a result, returned goods remained abundant, with prices only at 6.15 yuan to 6.1 yuan, a further decline of several points. The total volume of transactions in the city was estimated at 20,000 bags. Trading was extremely quiet due to windy and rainy conditions. Today, 3,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Xiamen.

Wheat: Yesterday's price decline was particularly severe, mainly because arrivals have been continuous in recent days. Factories were initially hesitant to purchase due to the sharp drop in rice prices and the sluggish flour sales on this street. Furthermore, the Northern Ocean merchant guilds were affected by the floods, making sales prospects bleak. Therefore, factories' demand for raw materials was very low. Seeing the unfavorable situation, customers actively reduced prices to sell off flour, which triggered factories' opportunistic buying. As a result, prices fell, and sales increased. It is estimated that the "Fu" and "Fu" factories jointly handled over 40,000 bags of wheat from Beijing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, and Suzhou, with the highest price at 9.1 yuan, down to 8 yuan, a decline of about 0.5 yuan.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Continue to Rise, Foreign Bonds Mixed

The securities market's off-exchange trading showed a continued bullish trend yesterday, with increasing buying interest. Some believe that the cause is the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet. In reality, a military cabinet is no different from replacing a cow with a sheep. It is unlikely to change its old ways. However, the recent rapid changes in the world situation, as seen in the attitudes of Britain and Japan after the German-Soviet rapprochement, have been drastically different. Therefore, there are rumors of a peaceful atmosphere, although it is too early to say. However, it is necessary to guard against a similar strategy of Germany and the Soviet Union, striking like lightning. Short sellers in the government bond market are already feeling apprehensive. Therefore, even if market prices fluctuate, they will eventually rise in a curve. The opening saw "Mao Tai" raise prices to buy in, followed by "Tong Kang," "Da Kang," and "Heng Fu" selling off and falling by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. Later, "Yong Kang" took advantage of the low prices to absorb a large amount, and "Da Feng Lian He" also made significant purchases. The sellers were mainly scattered retail investors, apart from "Hong Kang Lian Yi." As a result, the final rise was still significant, ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 yuan. In the afternoon, prices continued to rise by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan but failed to stabilize. The total transaction volume was estimated at over 700,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

In stock trading, 150 shares of "Huashang Electrical" were traded at 5.3 yuan per share.

Furthermore, the Shanghai Public Industry Association reported that the stock market is still dominated by the European situation. Coupled with the complexity of this settlement, the public's interest is generally lacking. In the afternoon, the market slightly improved, with several thousand shares of "Yihe Yarn Factory" being traded at around 18 yuan.

The stock market quotations for British-owned Far Eastern companies in London on the 28th of this month (Monday) were sluggish with little change. Only "Gulag Rubber" slightly fell by 1.5 pence, to 15 shillings and 7.5 pence. The rest remained unchanged. Gulag Lin Pang 15/7 1/2 down 0.1/2.

London's Chinese foreign debt market quotations for the 28th of this month (Monday) showed mixed ups and downs. British-German continuation (British issuance) and British-French (British issuance) each rose by 2 pounds, with the former at 41 pounds and the latter at 40 pounds. The "Crespo" loan rose by 1 pound, to 18.5 pounds. The "Rehabilitation" loan and the "Shanghai-Nanjing Railway" loan each fell by 1 pound, with the former at 25 pounds and the latter at 12 pounds (according to the telegram from the 23rd, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway loan fell from 13 pounds to 8.5 pounds due to a coding error. This is a correction). The "Tianjin-Pukou" original British issuance fell by 1.5 pence, and the "Tianjin-Pukou" original German issuance and the "Tianjin-Pukou" continuation British issuance each fell by 2 pounds, with prices all at 10 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

### Silk and Tea: Tea Prices Do Not Fall

In the past two days, the sales of foreign-owned green tea have been very sluggish due to the tense situation in Europe. The trading of various green teas, especially ordinary "Zhenmei," is the most stagnant. Only a few "Chouxin Zhenmei" have been sold. Although "Xiamu Zhucha" is relatively active, the market is not as good as before. Market sentiment is weak, and tea prices have uniformly decreased. Yesterday, only "Tongfu Baochang" and other firms bought "Zhucha" and "Zhenmei," totaling over 180 boxes. "Zhucha" sold for 385 yuan, "Zhenmei" sold for 240 yuan, and "Chouzhen" sold for 346 yuan. The market has fallen by 50 to 60 yuan compared to before, and it may be difficult to stabilize in the future.

Spring and Autumn

### Soaring Prices and Wage Increases

— Mangmang

Since the slogan of "United Front" was shouted, everyone concentrated on dealing with the war of resistance, and the class struggle has long been stopped. Laborers are enduring under the conditions of being able to maintain the minimum standard of living. And the capitalists do not oppress the workers as they used to. In the two years of the War of Resistance, the situation of labor-capital coordination has never been seen before.

In recent months, because of the special status of Shanghai, the soaring prices have made people breathless. This has a huge impact on the laborers. The compensation obtained by the laborers was originally to maintain the minimum standard of living, but now the standard of living has suddenly increased sharply. This can be solved by "reducing expenditure" in the middle and upper classes, but laborers have no "expenditure" to "reduce," and now even struggling is impossible. Fortunately, the capitalists are well aware of the righteousness and understand the difficulties of the suffering masses, and have taken the initiative to increase wages (as mentioned in this publication the day before yesterday), and the question is easily resolved. On the one hand, it is that capitalists gradually understand the true meaning of "United Front"; and on the other hand, they also understand that the result of oppressing laborers, in addition to unfortunate conflicts, will also cause social unrest, thereby affecting the stable life of capitalists. Therefore, the act of increasing wages automatically is not only beneficial to the War of Resistance, but also beneficial to the capitalists themselves.

However, there are still a few capitalists who remain in the pre-war stage, taking a short-sighted view of their own interests and refusing to agree to the laborers' request for wage increases, which has led to unfortunate disturbances such as the Ruyi factory strike, which is very regrettable. However, there is no fundamental conflict in this. There is still a bit of misunderstanding. Laborers should be able to avoid using drastic measures and argue reasonably in good faith; and if capitalists can make concessions within a possible range, the gap between labor and capital will be eliminated.

In order to make it easier for capitalists to accept, the demands put forward by the laborers may be dynamic, not fixed. In other words, increasing or decreasing remuneration according to the level of the standard of living is beneficial to both parties. For capitalists, a lower standard of living can proportionally reduce wages, so that there will not always be a larger expenditure. For laborers, when the standard of living rises again in the future, wages can also be increased proportionally again, without having to re-raise the request and cause trouble.

Below, I will suggest a few methods that I have thought of for social reference.

(1) The method of increasing wages should not be distributed according to the proportion of the amount of salary. Methods such as adding 10 yuan to those with 100 yuan and adding 1 yuan to those with 10 yuan are completely useless, because the people who are in difficulty are originally the people in the small salary class, so it should be based on the minimum living expenses as the standard, and it is reasonable to add to those with low salaries. (2) Wage increases may be based on the level of rice prices, because what constitutes the living elements of laborers is rice! (3) If you are unwilling to increase wages, you can use the rice subsidy method. The original salary amount is not increased, and a subsidy is added to the salary according to the rice market.

(5) The capital side purchases a large amount of rice and resells it to the laborers at the lowest price (avoiding hoarding, speculation, and profiteering).

(5) The capital side directly provides laborers with food and accommodation, allowing the families of laborers to move to the interior and maintain their family life with their original salaries.

(6) Thoroughly eliminate exploitation between labor and capital.

These conditions may be considered as an additional expense from the capital side, and the income on the labor side may not be as good as before. Therefore, labor and capital are not hostile to each other. On the contrary, labor and capital have a common hostile person, and the War of Resistance is to eliminate such obstacles. The sincere cooperation between labor and capital is to stabilize the country and help the War of Resistance. Then, for the sake of future freedom and happiness, both labor and capital must temporarily endure and solve the current difficulties without expanding them.

### Tears from the West

— Wang Yizhi

History is the supreme treasure of the human world. If you are nurtured by national history to save the country, you will have a strong and unyielding spirit of unity. If you are a scientist who knows the history of science in detail, you can achieve inventions. The "Shen Bao" is the oldest daily in Chinese history. Great figures in the West, such as Wilson of the United States, achieved their life's work from political history; such as Dr. Colijn, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, a generation of authority traces back to economic history. The use of history is too numerous to mention. On a smaller scale, as for oneself, because of not forgetting the past, it is easier to solve the difficulties and setbacks of the second half of life, so Zhao Shi has helped my ability and spirit. I am grateful for the hard struggle of life, from the past to the present, and I will never forget the past of Mao Yi, who sacrificed himself to exchange experience for me in the lane 20 years ago. On the 20th anniversary of Mao Yi's death, I composed 20 seven-character quatrains. This is the painful history of the past, which is the foundation of my life's learning, and I advise my compatriots across the country not to lose heart if they suffer pain. You must know that the more painful the spirit, the stronger it is, and only with the strongest spirit can you achieve great success. October 14th, 27th year of the Republic of China.

A mound floats outside the misty autumn smoke,

Ten thousand emotions sob before the setting sun,

I bitterly remember the place of heartbreak in the West,

Twenty years of regret are paid to the abyss.

The place of heartbreak refers to the Lankenau Girls' School on 22nd Street in Philadelphia, the old capital of the United States, where Mao Yi died in the seventh year of the Republic of China.

Lotus Pavilion and Orchid Oar, I ask about the old traces,

Water flows out of Yongjin Gate,

A broken dream remains where the green mountains are missing,

Hang a late bell when the blue sea withers.

In the sixth year before the beginning of the Republic of China, in the year of Bingwu, I met Mao Yi on a yacht in the Hu Mansion on the edge of the Lotus Fragrance Residence by the West Lake.

Qiannan is as dangerous as Hangu Pass,

I got several bends of the road in the setting sun,

Green leaves are like tides, yellow leaves are like rain,

The whip silk and temple shadows are between the tribute chapters.

In the autumn of the fifth year before the Republic of China, in the year of Dingwei, I followed my father-in-law, Lian Zhai Mingfu, south to take up a new post. The following autumn, I forked and traveled north with my entourage. The whip silk and temple shadows were reflected among the overlapping mountains and peaks. Mao Yi rode in a sedan chair, and I and my brothers Zhi Xiang rode horses, enjoying the scenery of Qiannan. This feeling will never be forgotten.

Hundreds of miles of baskets and wide eyes,

Teenage tours of Jiangshan city,

What is worth remembering in life,

Firecrackers and bright lights under Ganzhou.

At the beginning of the fourth year before the Republic of China, in the year of Wushen, I was newly appointed as the principal of An Yuan, and I immediately packed my bags and went to Ganzhou to manage the Wen Lai. On the eve of the fifth day of the New Year, I arrived at the government city. Along the way, there were firecrackers and bright lights, as if welcoming distant guests. On the way back, I traveled in the mountains in a sedan chair. The wind and snow were heavy. After returning to the Yishou, Lian Zhai Zhang and Duanmu Juchu Fu cared for me so much. Good times do not come again, and the impression is profound.

The ancient gate and idle government office have no barking dogs,

I lingered in Sanjiang to avoid the summer,

How extreme is the feeling on this night,

The bright moon shines on thousands of homes and brocade windows.

In the second year before the Republic of China, in the year of Gengxu, Lang Xian Xian.

Uncle Yue Yong took office as Sima of Sanjiang, and I wanted to avoid.

To spend the rest of the summer, I went to Cao'e River for a tour. (Unfinished)

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 15: Overseas rumors suddenly greet Taoye, a strange scene in the fire turns into a lotus flower.

Do you know who this person is? It is this Chinese student who studied in France who succeeded. Sure enough, Alice had a headache this day and had already fallen asleep. Moreover, because her mother had gone out, the house was quiet and she slept soundly. It was not until the fire trucks came on the road and there was a lot of noise that her sweet dream was awakened. In fact, there were many neighbors on the fifth floor, and they had all escaped. Wouldn't they wake up Alice? They had no sense of public morality and only cared about their own lives? That's not true. They thought that Alice and her mother had gone out, and Alice's cancellation of the concert was a temporary one. They also saw that the lights in her room were dark, and they thought that her mother and daughter were not at home. Alice woke up from her dream, and fortunately, her bedroom was facing the road. When she looked at the situation on the road, she knew that there was a fire. She didn't know where the fire was, because the fire on the third floor was behind their house. She quickly ran to the elevator without putting on her clothes, but no one was opening the elevator and no one was answering the bell. She quickly ran to the steps, and just as she went down a floor, she saw a cloud of thick smoke rolling up the stairs and hitting Alice's face, making it impossible to open her eyes. Alice screamed sharply and knew that the fire was in the apartment. Suddenly, she thought of the escape door. Going out from the Taipingmen and going downstairs, there was still a spiral staircase, and all the chances of survival were only in this line. She opened the Taipingmen and looked down, shouting: Ah! Only half of the spiral staircase was left, and the bottom was broken. She still ran back to her bedroom, opened the window, and wanted to jump down. But how could she jump down from the high building on the fifth floor? Jumping down would also break her hands and feet and burst her brains. At that time, she was wearing a snow-white long gauze nightgown, with jade-snow-like feet bare, and black hair as fluffy as dark clouds, dragging on her head, neck, and back, kneeling on the ground and praying. She had to wait for the fire to burn her body, and there was no other way. She also thought in her heart: If it weren't for the headache, I would have gone to the concert with my mother long ago. It was also my fate to suffer this tragic disaster, so I was left here alone. I wonder if my mother is still at the concert at this moment? When you come out, your daughter will have become scorched wood. Lord! Have mercy on me, an innocent daughter! While she was praying silently, she saw a person rushing in from the window. She couldn't see clearly who it was. She only saw him walk up to her and gently and skillfully hold Alice in his arms. He attached to her ear and said: 'Miss Alice! I'm here! Your mother is so anxious, let's go down!" (175)

### The Inside Story of the Automobile School

— A Person Who Has Been There

Twenty Days of Vacation a Month, What to Learn? After a Year of Practice, I Still Don't Dare to Take the Exam

In order to acquire some skills during the summer vacation, I resolutely went to ×× Automobile School to register after the big exam. I was learning to drive. In addition to the 32 yuan tuition fee, the license fee cost 8.3 yuan, and other miscellaneous fees were not included. The driving location is in the western suburbs of Shanghai, for the convenience of time, every day. After the car arrives at the designated location, anyone can go up and drive. However, an old car that can no longer be broken can accommodate up to six people. After you compete, the strong ones naturally occupy the seats, and the weak me has to watch them drive away. One car...two cars, it wasn't until the last car that I had my seat. Although it was said at the time of registration that you could drive every 20 minutes, in fact, no trip exceeded 10 minutes. Moreover. There are so many holidays that it is difficult to count. In addition to Sundays and anniversaries, holidays in the abolished calendar must also be taken off according to school rules. There are also unexpected price days, such as rainy days and car damage. Sometimes, in order to break a tire, you have to rest for half a day to a day, allowing students to be exposed to the sun on the road. They never come to inform you. If there is any damage to the inside of the car, it is not uncommon to take several days off in a row, so they often use Daodian to save their gasoline. Like the windy and rainy days these two days, they are exactly what they want. There are at least 20 days a month when you don't drive. Can you still practice so skillfully? Let's take myself as an example. I'm not good at being smart, but I'm not too stupid. I've been learning for two months now, but my driving skills are still indifferent, and the test has only become a dream. There are many students who have been studying for almost a year and still can't try.

The two-month summer vacation has passed slowly, and most schools have started again. Of course, I can't let the precious time be destroyed in empty expectations, I have to continue to work hard in my position. However, I hope that my comrades and friends will not repeat my mistakes. I am a good warning. And I dare to guarantee that, in addition to this school with only an external appearance, there is no school more corrupt than it.

Random Notes on Performers

### Miss Yu Sulian, a Famous Dan, Talks About Stage Life and Aspirations (Part 1)

— Leng Fang's Records

(Editor's Introduction) Yu Sulian, from Hangzhou, is twenty-two years old. She specializes in female roles (Hua Shan) and has a wide repertoire. She initially performed local plays, and her true talent was not revealed. Last winter, she joined "Golden Stage," and finally, she was able to fully demonstrate her strengths. As a result, her reputation rose sharply, and her position in the theater world changed dramatically from the past. Eager to improve, she is not complacent, and her future achievements are immeasurable. Today, among the southern female roles, she is indeed a rare and excellent person.

While learning and performing at the same time, my stage life has unknowingly reached seven years today! Singing is such a difficult job. In such a short process, there will certainly not be very high achievements in art. However, I have a very strong commitment to learning and have not neglected my courses and work for even a day. I firmly believe that success always belongs to those who work hard. Therefore, my only task is to constantly bury myself in hard work on the path of art.

Learning to Act as a Child

My father's stage name is Yu Xiaonong, and he used to play male roles (Xu Sheng). He was originally from the Xiliancheng Opera School in Beijing. When I was ten years old, he taught me to sing opera at home in Hangzhou. Because I didn't really like learning male roles, we soon moved to Ningbo, where I went back to school to study. Later, when I was thirteen, we moved to Shanghai, where I began to learn opera from teachers, focusing on Qingyi and Hua Shan roles. I have had more than twenty opera teachers, and I have learned quite a few different plays, probably around a hundred.

First Time on Stage

I remember my first time on stage was in Hangzhou, singing a week of charity performances. I was only fourteen years old at the time. For the first few days, I was a little nervous on the red carpet, but after singing for two or three days, my enthusiasm suddenly soared, and I no longer felt shy. After that, I worked hard to learn opera and also hired a female teacher to teach me to read. When I was sixteen, the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident occurred. Coincidentally, someone from Ningbo invited my father and me to join their troupe. We left Shanghai in a semi-refugee situation. I performed in Ningbo for a year, which was also the beginning of my formal debut. Regarding my acting experience, from the age of seventeen, I spent more than a year wandering around Nanjing and the Yangtze River area. The following year, I returned to Shanghai and was invited to perform at the same stage for nearly two years. Then, I moved to the Carlton Theater for eight months. In the early winter of last year, I was hired by the Golden Theater, and I have been there ever since.

### Preface to the An Kang Elegant Gathering (4)

— Tian Xu Wo Sheng

Among the "Four Unions", although there are also places where Yifan transitions, its first section is purely southern style, never mixing in northern tunes. It is only when transitioning to allegro that it enters the northern melody and uses Yifan. People in the Ming and Qing dynasties liked to incorporate Southern Xianlü into Shuangjiao tunes, which shows that "Four Unions" actually originated in the Ming dynasty. Although Song people had lyrics like "Four Offenses" and "Eight Offenses" and favored self-composed tunes like Jiang Baishi, they still did not adopt Yifan. Only Su Dongpo's "Water Melody" has the style of a Guanxi strongman with a bronze zither and iron clapper. This is because Long and Shu are close to each other, making it so. The name "Four Unions" can be proved by "Eight Unions."

In our Hangzhou Lantern Festival, the dance of fish and dragons is performed, with a so-called score of "Yang Xiang Eight Unions." All eight sounds of gold, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, and wood are fully equipped, similar to ten-beat gongs and drums, but without Zhaojun's pipa and Wenji's Hu jia. This is based on Shao Shi Yang striking the chime stone and Xiang. Two cymbals, three gongs, two drums, and one clapper are used with hand percussion and wooden fish to mark the rhythm. Additionally, trumpets are used instead of Xun Chi. The so-called "Four Unions" removes gold, stone, gourd, and earth, and uses silk, bamboo, leather, and wood. But drums and clappers are combined with silk and bamboo, and gongs and drums are not used. Although divided into four sections, there are eight segments, from adagio to allegro, symbolizing the division of time. Heaven has no words, so there is sound but no text. It cannot be compared with the loss of sound of Lu drums and Xue drums. It is like the unspoken understanding between high mountains and flowing water. As for its singing sentences, they are not seven-character quatrains, but Partridge Sky and Auspicious Partridge. Qin Guan and Yan Shu liked this tune, which proves that it is a Song dynasty lyric rather than a Tang dynasty poem. It is a pity that Wen Tianxiang's story has no tradition of singing. It was probably forbidden by the Yuan people, just like the Guangling San, which has been lost. It is a pity. I sincerely hope that the people in the An Kang Elegant Gathering can supplement its loss like Shu Xi, so that it will be beneficial to the world and people's hearts like the poems of South Nigh.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The new theaters have superstitions about opening the door and breaking the stage, so general insiders always attribute the blame to the pharmacy opposite the stage. The gate of the Tianchan is facing northeast, and the pharmacy opposite is located in the corner facing southwest. The so-called tip-to-tip, corner-to-corner, point-to-point is not biased. I do not understand why the owner who built the house in the first place, since he wanted to build a theater, no matter what the seniors of the Pear Garden said, he could always change the gate to face north or east, avoiding this number, wouldn't it eliminate the distorted psychology of general superstitious people? In addition, such as the wind of the stage often rises, sometimes open and sometimes closed, is also in line with a Beijing slang: it is really a bit evil.

The opening of the door is certainly a careful matter, and at the same time, when the stage is completed, there must also be a grand ceremony of breaking things. The actors who sing martial arts plays and the people of the entire martial arts line are certainly particularly devout to pay attention to this matter, hoping for the blessing of the gods, so that they will not throw the knives and guns out of their hands and smash them on the eyes of the audience, or fall off the iron railings (now abolished on the stage) and several tables and break their waists and legs. Even the students, dans, and clowns who sing civil plays are also afraid that they will get their head tendons and break their arms and backs at the limit of bone setting during grabbing backs and hanging hair (the limit of bone setting, that is, the important). If there are really these unfortunate events on stage, then the general actors will blame it on the carelessness of the initial breaking of the stage, resulting in today's mistakes, if they do not recognize their own mediocrity. Regarding this matter, I have personally seen it in the Yunlong Stage in my hometown, and the actor who caused the trouble that day was the martial arts student Shan Deyuan, who is currently performing on a certain stage in this city. Those who are familiar with Shan Ling may wish to inquire. (Eight Nine)
