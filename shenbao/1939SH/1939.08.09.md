### Donghua Army in Shanxi Recovers Lin County; Japanese Troops Near Sui County Attacked by Chinese Forces from North and South; Highlands Near Yangzi Occupied by Chinese Army; Successful Counterattack by Guangdong Army Recovers Xinjie Station

The war situation in eastern Shanxi is progressing smoothly for the Chinese side daily. The Japanese army had previously concentrated its forces, based in Changzhi and Lucheng, attempting to join forces with the Japanese troops in She County to attack Licheng. Their aim was to open up their east-west trunk line from Linfen to Dongyangguan. However, due to a preemptive strike by the Chinese army, which attacked Huguan, captured Changzhi, and forced the Japanese troops stationed in Tunliu to move west, the Japanese army felt at a loss. Furthermore, continuous rain and rising river waters forced the Japanese troops in She County to retreat due to high water levels, making their previous plans a complete failure. Under favorable weather conditions, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on the Japanese troops in Hengshui (east of Lin County) on the 2nd. A plainclothes team of a certain unit even encircled and attacked the Japanese flanks. After fierce fighting until noon, the Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties and were unable to hold out, retreating towards Shuiye (west of Anyang). The Japanese army's supply lines to Lin County were cut off by the Chinese army. A certain unit of the Chinese army then took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese troops in Lin County. After a day and night of intense fighting, the Japanese troops, feeling isolated, concentrated all their forces to launch a fierce assault on a certain unit of the Chinese army north of them. The Chinese army, in order to lure the Japanese troops away from the Lin County town, feigned weakness and gradually retreated north. The Japanese troops, unaware of the ruse, pressed on relentlessly. Once the objective of luring the enemy away from the mountain was achieved, a local team of the Chinese army took advantage of the situation and recaptured Lin County in one fell swoop. Having lost their base, the Japanese troops took advantage of the pre-dawn darkness to flee northeast. The Chinese army is now consoling the civilians while pursuing the Japanese troops. The recovery of Lin County provides an additional layer of protection for the Chinese side's superior outer defenses of the Taihang Mountains. (7th dispatch)

(Luoyang) The war situation in western Shanxi has been dormant for a long time. Recently, in order to support the war situation in eastern Shanxi, the Japanese troops in Lishi set out on the 4th in four routes to invade westward, attempting to spy on Liulin Jun Ferry. One group set out from Xiyadi Zaolin Village, one group set out from Mamaozhuang, one group set out from Qiaojiacheng Liangjiahui, and one group set out from Lijiawan Wangjiahui. However, each group had only a small number of troops, only a little over a hundred people. The Chinese army xx unit intercepted them on different routes. On the morning of the 5th, they also began mobile strategies and attacked the Japanese. The x unit stormed into Xishu Mountain (north of Lishi) in one fell swoop, killing many Japanese soldiers. The x unit also attacked Daheng Mountain (west of Lishi) with agility. Despite the fierce resistance from the Japanese army, the brave Chinese soldiers risked their lives in hand-to-hand combat, engaging in bayonet fighting. After a fierce battle, they finally completely occupied Daheng Mountain. The remaining Japanese troops are retreating westward. (8th dispatch)

(Luoyang) There have also been small-scale engagements in southern Shanxi recently. At dawn on the 2nd, over 400 Japanese troops attacked from Nantian Gan Luanshi Peak (southeast of Jincheng), but were met with a head-on blow from a certain unit of the Chinese army. After a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops were unable to hold out and fled towards the Daokou Tianjingguan area (southeast of Jincheng). On the night of the 2nd, over 200 Japanese troops in Boai again harassed the areas of Daxiaohuangling (north of Boai). A certain unit of the Chinese army ambushed them midway, and the Japanese troops also fled in disarray towards Xuliang (west of Boai). (7th dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to a statement by the Chinese military spokesman, after the Japanese army's failed offensive at Mingguang Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway, they have shifted their main force to attack the Henan-Hubei border.

At the same time, the Chinese army in Dahong Mountain also launched an attack on Sui County. The Japanese troops, suffering from attacks from both north and south, were met by fresh Chinese forces on the Lishan line. They collapsed and retreated to the Shanshuigou Jiangjiahe area, constructing fortifications to defend. In addition, over a thousand Japanese troops are actively operating in the Junchuandian Anjudian Luoyangdian area. The Chinese Dahong Mountain garrison is closely monitoring them. (8th dispatch)

Miluo. After two months of silence, six Japanese warships and over twenty motorboats sailed into the lake area of the Xiangbei Lujiaoshi on the morning of the 8th, firing over a hundred shells at the shore, creating a probing disturbance. The Chinese lake defense forces also returned fire to suppress them, and the two sides engaged in artillery fire. By 2 p.m., the shelling had ceased, and the Japanese warships and boats had escaped. (8th dispatch)

Zhaoqing. On the 4th, the Japanese troops in Jiangmen forcibly seized 70-80 civilian boats, carrying hundreds of soldiers to the Rongqi River in Shunde. On the 5th, the Japanese troops in Guizhou continuously fired artillery shells, frantically bombarding the Chinese positions, attempting to cover the Japanese troops' advance north. The Chinese military and civilians along the river are calmly preparing to meet the attack. (8th dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Foreign news reports that after the Japanese army's invasion of Zhongshan was repelled, they shifted their focus and concentrated their forces in Yangjiang, east of Guangzhou Bay, and Fangcheng, west of Beihai, causing tension in both areas. There are currently eleven Japanese warships and twenty steamships near the coast of Yangjiang. It is said that this concentration will be larger than the Zhongshan campaign. In addition, 4,000 Japanese troops were sent to reinforce northern Guangdong. The Chinese army took advantage of their absence to launch a counterattack, directly attacking Xinjie Station. The Chinese air force also shot down a Japanese plane at Lotus Mountain. Due to the Chinese army's counterattack, there have been battles on all fronts in Jiangmen, Foshan, Xinhui, and Xin'an. (8th special dispatch)

Fancheng. The Japanese troops in Yangzi, southwest of Dahong Mountain, previously launched a vigorous attack north in coordination with the Japanese troops in Sui County. They were met by the Chinese troops who crossed the river to fight back. Now they are retreating to defend Yangzi. The Chinese army has occupied the highlands over ten miles north of Yangzi, surrounding and attacking them. In the afternoon of the 7th, over two hundred Japanese troops came to reinforce them, but were ambushed by the Chinese forces at Daxiao Chenchong, killing over thirty Japanese soldiers. The Japanese still retreated back to Huangjiaji. (8th dispatch)

(Luoyang) After the Japanese army captured Lishan on the 5th, they continued to increase their strength with over twenty tanks and over a thousand infantry, advancing from Jingmingpu (northwest of Lishan) towards Tangxianzhen (northwest of Jingmingpu), attempting to attack Zaoyang. The Chinese xx unit is currently intercepting them east of the xx line. (7th dispatch)

Those who were even slightly suspicious were immediately killed. There is a shortage of food in Chaozhou City. The Japanese army forced the residents to donate, and the poor residents, unable to bear the oppression, fled in droves. (7th dispatch)

Editorial

### Siam and Today's International Situation

Yesterday's Hong Kong telegram stated: "It is suddenly rumored here that Siam is about to join the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, which has greatly shocked the people, because if Siam does join the alliance, the position of Britain and France in the Far East will inevitably be greatly weakened; however, according to a Bangkok telegram obtained privately here, the Siamese government has already come forward to deny the rumors of joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, and has dismissed them as groundless." This is a private telegram. Last night, another telegram from London stated: "It is rumored that Siam has already joined the Anti-Comintern International Public. The Siamese Embassy in England has firmly denied this." This is credible. In this time of international crises and dangers, Siam's actions are often overlooked by the world. However, Siam's position cannot be overlooked, and if an international war breaks out, the relationship will be very important. Siam has a vast territory of 530,000 square kilometers, which is larger than China's Xikang Province; its population is 12.5 million, which is slightly less than China's Guangxi Province, and overseas Chinese account for 2.5 million, accounting for one-fifth of the total; it is not a large country. The religion is Buddhism, and the monks are the most influential. Eight out of ten civilians are farmers, the cultural level is not high, the political situation has only been stable for three or five years, the finances are not prosperous, and the military strength is insufficient. It is also not a strong country. It is located in the southwest of China, vertically south of Kunming, Yunnan, which is its capital, Bangkok; it borders French Indochina to the northeast, British Burma to the northwest, the Gulf of Siam to the east, the Bay of Bengal to the west, and the British Malaya Federation to the south, which is the mother body of Singapore naval base, the British Far East naval base; therefore, the country is not big or strong, but it is actually located among the powerful. So why should it not be overlooked in the turbulent world? Independent countries have their lives, their strength, and their consciousness; and the only independent countries in the Far East are China, Japan, and Siam. Siam is not strong enough to influence the overall situation in the Far East on its own, but its partiality can have a significant impact. If Siam is on good terms with Britain and France, then Britain and France have no demands on Siam; if Siam forms a strong ally and is hostile to Britain and France, it will become a threat to Britain and France's Far East forces; although the Singapore naval base is strong, it can rely on Siam to strike the back of Singapore; if the "Kra" canal is dug through Siam's waist to connect the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, not only will Singapore no longer be the key to the east and west, but the treasure trove of India can also be coveted. Can it be said that it can be overlooked? The Japanese have been wooing Siam for a long time with smiles, courtesy, sons and daughters, jade and silk, and Amitabha Buddha, without being meticulous. The rumor that Siam has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact has also been frequently spread in recent months, and there are clues for a reason; therefore, yesterday's statement that it has already joined should not be regarded as abrupt; and it is also transmitted at the same time as the vigorous suppression of overseas Chinese, the closure of schools, and the search of banks; the Hong Kong telegram said that the people were greatly shocked by this, which is appropriate. Fortunately, it has now been proven that the rumors are not accurate, and Chamberlain is probably already full of false alarms!

However, there are things that must be discussed: the untrustworthiness of the statement that Siam has already joined the Anti-Comintern Pact does not need London and Hong Kong's public and private telegrams to prove it; the time has not yet come, and the situation does not allow it. Why? Although Siam is an independent country and should have freedom of consciousness, it is difficult to choose between several strong countries and cannot freely express its consciousness; at this time of international chaos, with friends and enemies all over the place, and everything is about to be divided, even if Siam's anti-communist consciousness is full of both the government and the public, how can it first choose its friends and enemies, determine its fate, and eagerly join the Anti-Comintern Pact? It has not been heard that Britain and France have any plans to annex Siam; and when Britain's Singapore naval base is about to be completed, it intends to lend Siam huge sums of money to help it strengthen its military preparations, and the friendship is not bad. Moreover, at this time, Japan has no extra time to manage Siam, no extra power to guarantee Siam, and it is not the time to rely on Siam to divide Britain and France. If Siam rashly joins the aggressive group, so that Annan, Burma, and Malaya will be directly threatened in the future, and India, where resources are located, and Singapore, a military stronghold, will be indirectly shaken, then Britain and France will definitely not raise a boil and will definitely take the lead in getting the upper hand. It can be asserted; and at this time, this situation is as easy as taking something out of a bag; this is well known to Siam, and it will definitely not want to bring disaster upon itself. Thus, it can be known that the statement that it has already joined is unbelievable.

To say that Siam will never join the Anti-Comintern International Public, and London and Hong Kong can be free from concern about Siam; this is not the case, and it must not be the case. The key lies not in how Siam's consciousness will freely choose to obey; but in how Siam's international environment will evolve. If an international war breaks out, then Siam's impartiality can affect a part of the military. Those who lose Siam will be burdened by Siam, so it is said that Siam cannot be overlooked, but this is not what is said today. As it stands now, the war has not yet broken out, then although Siam is jealous of overseas Chinese and abuses overseas Chinese, Siam's attitude towards Britain and Japan, whether as friends or enemies, will depend on the victory or defeat of China's war of resistance; in other words, Siam has newly named its country "Thailand"; "Thailand" means freedom. However, whether it can maintain its status as Thailand while mediating between the British and French forces, or whether it will inevitably suffer the sharp edge of aggression and be reduced to a vassal, merely becoming a ladder for aggressors to advance south, will only depend on the victory or defeat of China's war of resistance. If China's war of resistance is not victorious, "the position of Britain and France in the Far East will inevitably be greatly weakened." Under coercion, Siam will be unable to avoid joining the Anti-Comintern International Public even if it is unwilling, and Britain and France will be unable to oppose its joining. Hong Kong and Annan will no longer belong to Britain and France, which goes without saying. Even Burma and India will not be able to obtain Siam as a buffer or shield. For China must win. Only then will the Far East be stable, the international community have order, and there will be rules to be followed together: and Siam must also maintain its glorious history and be an independent Thailand, so today's London and Hong Kong do not need to worry or rejoice about Siam's joining the Anti-Comintern International Public, but must pay attention to the victory or defeat of the Sino-Japanese War!

### Assault Incident: British Consulate in Tianjin Lodges Serious Protest with Japan; Demands Cessation of Anti-British Movement; Japanese Side Has Not Yet Responded; Admits Mobs Passed Through Japanese Sentry Lines

(Tianjin) Regarding the incident last Friday in which mobs attacked the British Swire branch and the British International Trading Company in the former Russian concession, the British Consul Jameson lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Consul Tadashiro this morning, and requested the Japanese military authorities to stop the anti-British movement in the Japanese-controlled area, and requested that Japanese soldiers be stationed in front of British-owned shops in the Japanese-controlled area for defense. However, as of the time of the telegram, the Japanese Consul had not yet responded. According to those close to the Japanese Consul, the Japanese side will definitely reject the British protest, using the excuse that the Chinese people's anti-British sentiment is a natural expression, or will even state that if the British can support Japan's establishment of a new order in East Asia, then this kind of anti-British movement will naturally be eliminated as a response. According to the Japanese military spokesman, the demonstrators on that day did safely pass through the Japanese sentry lines. These people did not carry passes. The reason why the Japanese sentries let them pass is because these people did not have any suspicious points. (8th Associated Press telegram)

(Beiping) Today, the local newspapers published a list of British goods prohibited from public purchase, with a list of Chinese, Japanese, and German goods that can be used as substitutes, and also carried news of a riot caused by a mass meeting in Zuoshan, Jiaoji Railway. It is said that the masses invaded the property of the Asiatic Petroleum Company and seized a large amount of gasoline and kerosene. According to missionary sources, a new anti-American incident occurred in Huoxian, one hundred miles southeast of Taiyuan. An American belonging to the China Inland Mission in the area has been expelled from the city. The missionary is now avoiding other missionaries in Jiexiu, fifty miles away. (8th Reuters telegram)

(Qingdao) The British cruiser Kent arrived here this morning. (8th Reuters telegram)

### Anti-American Slogans Discovered in North China; Japanese Side Denies Involvement

(Beiping) Several British missionaries arrived here yesterday from Shijiazhuang. They claimed that they had seen anti-American slogans in Shijiazhuang. The Anti-Foreign Movement Committee there had plastered "Overthrow America" slogans all over Shijiazhuang. However, the Japanese Embassy here denied the movement, saying, "Our country's (Japan's) main policy is to maintain good relations with the United States." The Embassy spokesman also claimed that the so-called anti-American movement was a "fabricated message" and was "a British plan to drag the United States into the Far Eastern dispute." He also said that the Embassy had made a long-distance call to inquire with the Japanese troops stationed in Shijiazhuang and Kaifeng. According to the reply from the troops stationed there, no anti-American movement had been discovered locally. The spokesman continued, "There is no reason for anti-American demonstrations now or in the future." Foreigners here are paying attention to the situation in Kaifeng. The British missionaries who evacuated from there have reportedly handed over their property to American citizens for safekeeping. Yesterday, the Japanese military newspaper "Yong Bao" reported that the Kaifeng Anti-British Committee had decided to take over the property of the British churches, "in order to ensure that it would not be burned down by anti-British elements." Foreigners here predict that if the Anti-British Movement Committee expels the American citizens who are guarding the British missionary property, a conflict is quite possible. "Yong Bao" also stated that the Japanese troops stationed in Jinan had dispersed rioters who attacked the Asiatic Petroleum Company on August 1. The Japanese troops had seized six tins of gasoline stolen from the Asiatic Petroleum Company from the rioters and returned them to the company. Foreigners in Beiping believe that the anti-American movement that occurred in Shijiazhuang was carried out independently by local officials without the consent of senior Japanese military authorities.

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly Battle Report (Continued)

Guangdong Front: The Japanese troops advancing on Zhongshan in the West River landed infantry in two routes from Japanese warships, adopting a pincer formation. One route, from Rongqi and Guizhou, advanced from north to south, while the other occupied Hengmen, Qiding Mountain, Dajian Mountain, and Furong Island before advancing from south to north. After several rounds of valiant resistance by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops in the north suffered losses and fled back to their ships. The Chinese army in the south, starting from the first day, encircled and fiercely attacked the Japanese forces in several routes for two days and nights. All areas of Qiding Mountain, Dajian Mountain, Rongqi, and Guizhou have been completely recovered. The remaining Japanese forces are being cleared up. At the same time, another unit of the Chinese army entered Jiujiang (southeast of Sanshui) on the morning of the second day. The vanguard is now approaching Sanshui, causing panic among the Japanese. The Chinese army, which launched another attack on Shantou, reached the suburbs at dawn on the 31st. The Japanese resisted stubbornly, but over 300 were killed by Chinese machine guns and artillery, and all Japanese fortifications were destroyed. A part of the remaining Japanese forces broke through and retreated to Anbu, where they were ambushed by the Chinese army, which launched a surprise attack on their flanks, causing them to collapse in disarray. Over 400 Japanese and puppet soldiers and police officers, including the puppet police commander Huang Liu, were annihilated. The situation on the North River front has been quiet for several days.

The Novara forces, along with the Blackshirt Legion and the "Blue" team, completely surrounded the "Red" team, forcing them to retreat into the Alps. The final battle began at 7:00 AM and ended at 11:30 AM. The Crown Prince and other senior officials were present to observe, but Prime Minister Mussolini was not. The "Blue" team's air force bombed the "Red" team in the morning, forcing them to retreat. (Associated Press, 8th)

(Rome) The Italian army has been conducting a large-scale exercise in the Po River basin in northern Italy since midnight on the 1st of this month. It has now reached its final stage. The "enemy" has repeatedly attacked Turin from the foot of the Alps, but has been repelled by the "defending" mechanized units and armored divisions. General Bassi-Gualco, the commander-in-chief, has declared that the "defending army" has won a complete victory. The units participating in the exercise are scheduled to gather in Turin tomorrow, and on the 9th of this month, King Emmanuel III will review them, accompanied by senior generals. (Havas, 7th)

Warsaw: The Warsaw Evening Post recently reported that a part of the 7th Army of the German Army suddenly arrived in Chaiborz on the 4th of this month and took up positions in various public squares and schools. Chaiborz is located only a few kilometers from the Polish border. (Havas, 7th)

(London) Newspapers here are commenting on the European situation, saying that although the European situation has eased somewhat after the Danzig Free City Council accepted the Polish government's demands regarding the issue of Polish customs officials' authority over the Danzig Free City customs, it remains very serious. The London Times stated that judging from the recent developments in the Danzig Free City customs dispute, both Poland's ability to restrain itself and the Free City authorities' ability to stop at the right time are sufficient. In the meantime, most people believe that the entire Danzig issue remains in a dangerous period, and a slight carelessness could trigger a crisis. As for the reply submitted by the City Council, the Polish side has already considered it "completely satisfactory." However, as for the full impact, Danzig City National Socialist Party leader Forster is currently in Berchtesgaden, Germany, listening to the instructions of Führer Hitler. It is impossible to make a judgment until the content of these instructions is known. The News Chronicle reported that the tense situation has eased somewhat after the exchange of notes between the Polish government and the Danzig City Council on the customs issue. It is gratifying to see that the National Socialist Party does not seem to be inclined to extremes. However, the overall situation has not improved as a result. European countries are also stepping up mobilization. The originator of this dangerous move is the concentration of German troops near the Polish border under the guise of exercises, hoping to use it to support its demands on the Danzig issue. This is naturally the reason for Poland to conscript reserves as a countermeasure. Various countries are therefore preparing one after another, with a total of 10 million troops concentrated, which has indeed formed "a large barracks." (Havas, 8th)

(London) The News Chronicle reports that there are currently 10 million troops in a state of war readiness in Europe. The mobilization of such a large number of troops makes the war crisis imminent. However, due to the strength of both sides, there is a balance of power. At present, the dictatorial countries do not appear to want to overthrow this balance of power by violence. What will happen in the future will depend on the strength of the peace front. (Haitong, 8th)

### Large Amounts of European Gold Transferred to the Americas for Wartime Use

(New York) According to financial sources here, Britain is now storing large amounts of gold in the United States and Canada for use in purchasing various supplies in wartime. Many other countries have also stored gold in the United States, most of which has been transferred since the European situation became tense in recent years. In June of this year, Britain continued to deposit gold worth 25 million US dollars, bringing the total in current accounts to 122.5 million US dollars. This is a special deposit and is not included in the total US financial resources reported by the US Treasury Department. Most of it is intended for wartime purchases of military supplies from the United States. Since Britain's preparations for war and the increasing tensions between the Axis and non-Axis countries, more and more gold has flowed into the United States, especially from Britain and the Netherlands. In addition to the deposits in New York, the deposits in Canada have reached 300 million US dollars, all from London. Therefore, the total amount of gold stored in North America is no less than 1.5 billion US dollars. The inflow has been greatest in the past two months and is still being shipped. In the past week, gold worth 25.5 million US dollars was shipped in, of which 19 million came from London and 5 million from the Netherlands. If Britain is caught in the vortex of war and needs to purchase military supplies from the United States, this deposit can maintain the price of the pound and prevent it from suffering violent fluctuations.

### Poland and Danzig Agree to Negotiate, National Socialist Party Leader Visits Hitler Again, Polish Customs Official Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison

Warsaw: News has just been received here that Danzig Free City National Socialist Party leader Forster, accompanied by Czersky, the editor of the National Socialist Party's organ, the Danzig Vorposten, flew to Berchtesgaden, Germany, yesterday evening to visit Führer Hitler. (Havas, 8th)

(Berlin) There are no signs of easing in the Danzig situation. National Socialist Party leader Forster and Czersky have come to Berchtesgaden from the Free City on Forster's private plane to discuss everything with Hitler. The recent reply from the Danzig Senate to Poland's protest has not improved the situation. It is said that Poland is still dissatisfied with this reply. League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig Burckhardt is making every effort to mediate and create a favorable atmosphere. The Senate's reply stated that it was surprising that Poland considered recent events to be grounds for submitting an "ultimatum." It also stated that the armed patrols of Polish customs officials were a violation of the treaty. Danzig had not excluded Polish customs inspectors from the border since August 6. The reply opposed Poland's threat of retaliation and expressed its willingness to discuss the matter. Political circles in Berlin believe that the Danzig Senate's reply offers the possibility of exchanging views on the customs issue. Various circles in Germany have dismissed as untrue the suggestion that the Senate has already made concessions. German newspapers have described this as a dangerous move by Poland to provoke war. Polish customs inspector Ribensky, who was arrested by the Danzig authorities two months ago, was tried yesterday on charges of espionage, etc. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison for insulting Hitler, Goebbels, and disrupting peace, among other things. (Reuters, 8th)

Warsaw: Regarding the Danzig Free City customs issue, the official here recently issued a communiqué stating that after Polish High Commissioner to Danzig Chodacki submitted a written communication to the City Senate on the 5th of this month, the City Senate authorities verbally agreed that they did not intend to take any action against the Polish customs officials, and did not place an "accomplished fact" before Poland, and pledged to submit a written reply within two days. This reply was delivered to Chodacki this morning. In addition to reiterating the verbal promises, it stated that neither the City Senate nor the customs authorities had prohibited Polish customs officials from exercising their functions. Poland's communication was based on unfounded rumors, and its tone was aggressive and amounted to an "ultimatum," which should be protested. Thereafter, Poland would still be able to maintain control over the various customs offices in the Danzig City, and the City Senate was willing to conduct negotiations with Poland on the entire customs issue. (Havas, 7th)

Warsaw: Regarding the Danzig Free City customs issue, the reply submitted by the City Senate to the Polish government has just been commented on by people close to the government here, saying that Poland's position has not changed. It is willing to respond to the request of the Danzig City Senate and conduct negotiations with it, but on the condition that the legitimate rights of Polish customs officials are not infringed. Although the City Senate claims that it has not prohibited Polish customs officials from exercising their functions, it is true that on the 4th of this month, Polish customs officials in certain locations received a notice stating that they would no longer be allowed to wear uniforms, carry weapons, or perform their duties, otherwise they would be arrested. Then, at 11:00 PM on the 5th of this month, these customs officials received another notice stating that the above measures would be temporarily suspended. Until now, all Polish customs officials are still wearing uniforms and continuing to work. (Havas, 7th)

### Anglo-French-Soviet Alliance Political Negotiations Come to a Conclusion, British Envoy Returns Home to Resume Duty

Stockholm: Strang, the head of the Central European Division of the British Foreign Office, who was in Moscow to conduct negotiations with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, together with the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union, arrived here by plane from Moscow yesterday and flew back to London this morning. (Havas, 8th)

(London) Strang, the head of the Central European Division of the Foreign Office, returned home by plane from Moscow and is scheduled to arrive here at 4:45 PM today and report back to the Foreign Office tomorrow to resume his duties. According to well-informed sources, Sir Oliphant, the Assistant Under-Secretary of the Department, has recently been appointed as the Ambassador to Belgium, and the vacancy he left will be filled by Director Strang. (Havas, 8th)

(London) According to a Warsaw dispatch from the Daily Telegraph, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has informed the Polish ambassador to Moscow and requested that Poland send a delegation to participate in the Anglo-French-Soviet military talks. It is reported that Soviet Minister of War Voroshilov has stated to Molotov that without Poland's participation, the military talks will not be effective. The Anglo-French military mission is currently heading to Moscow on a special ship and can land in Leningrad at the end of this week, and then take a train directly to Moscow. (Reuters, 8th)

Warsaw: Regarding the Anglo-French reports that Poland will send a military representative to participate in the Moscow staff talks, authoritative sources here have denied it, stating that the reports are completely inconsistent with the facts. Poland believes that the Moscow talks are only related to the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, so it will not send a representative to participate. (Haitong, 8th)

### Spanish Government to Be Reorganized, Military and Fascists to Occupy Key Positions

Burgos: Government officials here recently announced that the Nationalist government will be reorganized, and the result will be to increase the power of the Fascists and the military. It is expected that important government positions, such as the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Interior, and Minister of Propaganda, will be filled by Fascist figures. Others, such as the Minister of Commerce, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Agriculture, will be filled by experts. The Minister of Military Affairs and the Minister of Public Security will be filled by military personnel. The position of Prime Minister will still belong to General Franco. Political figures believe that after the reorganization of the government, the national policy will remain the same, that is, to make the revitalization of Spain the most important task. The candidates for the heads of the newly established government departments and committees, such as the Political Committee and the National Assembly, will also be decided at the same time. In addition, the Secretary-General of the Spanish Falange will also be appointed. (Haitong, 8th)

Burgos: Spanish Head of State General Franco is actively preparing for the cabinet reorganization, working up to 18 hours a day. Except for the Minister of the Interior, Suner (General Franco's brother-in-law), all other guests are refused audience. In addition, many leaders of the Falange and important generals have recently gathered here to listen to General Franco's consultations. Most of them have finished their business and left here. (Havas, 7th)

### Bulgarian Parliamentary Delegation Arrives in Moscow, First Time After the European War

(Moscow) The Bulgarian parliamentary delegation, led by Deputy Speaker Markov, arrived here today. Those who came to the station to welcome them included Gorkin, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Bakov, Director of the Treaty Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Haifetz, Vice Chairman of the Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Bulgarian Ambassador Antonov and his staff. (TASS, 7th)

(Moscow) Twenty-five members of the Bulgarian Parliament have arrived here for a ten-day tour. This is the first semi-official or official visit to the Soviet Union from Bulgaria since the European War. Soviet Foreign Ministry officials and the Parliament Secretary greeted them at the train station. According to reliable sources here, this trip is only a gesture of goodwill between the two countries, and no negotiations are planned. The guests include the Vice President of the Bulgarian Parliament, the Director of the Budget Committee, and the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. (Reuters, 8th)

(Moscow) British envoy Strang boarded a plane from here yesterday to return to London. The reasons for Britain's recall of Strang have not yet been announced. He represented Britain in negotiations with the Soviet Union on the conclusion of an Anglo-French-Soviet military alliance. (Associated Press, 8th)

### Monstrosity: Heart Exposed Outside Chest, Breathing Normal

(Manila) A woman named Rafael in a certain obstetrical hospital in the Tondo district here gave birth to a girl last night whose heart was completely outside her chest, and its beating was very normal. People nearby flocked to observe, causing extreme crowding, so the police had to come to the scene to maintain order. According to famous doctors who visited the hospital, the child's breathing is still good, but because the heart is exposed, her life is unlikely to exceed 24 hours. (Associated Press, 8th)

Continued report: The baby girl, who was born with a cry at 12:30 yesterday, has lived for more than 27 hours so far, even though her heart is exposed. This is quite surprising to ordinary doctors. Many famous doctors and important people (including the First Lady of the Philippines) have come to inspect. Some doctors have considered returning her heart to its original position, but after Dr. Yewell examined her with X-rays, he felt that it was impossible to perform surgery. Except for the exposed heart, other parts are no different from normal people. (Associated Press, 8th)

### Japanese Five-Minister Conference Convenes to Review Countermeasures to European Situation, Heated Debate for Five Hours Without Concrete Results, New Instructions from London Arrive in Tokyo One After Another, Anglo-Japanese Conference May Resume Today

(Tokyo) The Five-Minister Conference carefully reviewed its European policy from 1:40 PM to 6:30 PM today. Because the ministers recognized the importance of the situation, they had to carefully consider all aspects, so the conference did not reach any conclusion and adjourned at 6:30 PM. The date of the next Five-Minister Conference has not yet been determined. (Domei, 8th)

(Tokyo) After this morning's regular cabinet meeting, the five ministers immediately gathered at the Prime Minister's residence in the afternoon. The purpose was to decide on a practical plan to adapt Japanese policy to the new developments in the European situation since the government formulated its European policy on June 5. According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," the Five-Minister Conference was initiated by Minister of the Army Itagaki, who believed that formulating a policy centered on the new European situation and focusing on the China Incident was not only inextricably linked to the handling of the China Incident but was also an indispensable condition for ending the China Incident. However, after the Prime Minister and the four ministers of the Army, Navy, Foreign Affairs, and Finance discussed with each other for five hours, they still did not reach any concrete results. Cabinet Secretary Ota published an article saying that the Five-Minister Conference began at 1:40 PM and adjourned at 6:30 PM to review the European situation, but no decision was made, so the five ministers will consider the matter again. It is said that because the matter is of great importance, the Five-Minister Conference must proceed carefully, so today's afternoon meeting could not reach a decision immediately. It is expected that several more meetings will be held before a measure with far-reaching effects on Japan's future policy can be decided. Before asking the Prime Minister to convene the Five-Minister Conference, Minister of the Army Itagaki convened a meeting of the administrative officials of the Ministry of the Army to decide on the Army's attitude toward the new developments in the European situation. After a decision was made, he consulted with the three giants of the Army, namely the Chief of the General Staff, the Inspector General of Military Education, and the Minister of the Army. The three giants approved it at a meeting on August 3. On Saturday night, Minister of the Army informed the Prime Minister of the results, and yesterday afternoon he visited Minister of the Navy Yonai to discuss concrete measures for joint action on this extremely important issue. After informing the Prime Minister of the results of the consultation with the Minister of the Navy, Harada, the private secretary of Saionji, visited Saionji and reported on domestic and foreign affairs, and returned to Tokyo this morning. (Reuters, 8th)

(Tokyo) According to political figures here, the Japanese military has asked the government to take an unambiguous attitude towards the European situation. Military figures believe that for the sake of national defense interests and to ensure Japan's Far Eastern policy, Japan must take firm action in accordance with the principles decided by the Cabinet meeting on June 5. This proposal will be discussed in today's inner cabinet meeting. (Haitong, 8th)

(Tokyo) Judging from the situation, the Anglo-Japanese conference, which has been stalled for more than a week, may resume tomorrow. British Ambassador Craigie stayed at the Karuizawa summer resort for a few days and returned to Tokyo this afternoon. Instructions from London are now being transmitted to the British Embassy one after another. Japanese representative Miyamoto visited British representative Picot at the British Embassy at 10:40 this morning to arrange the Tokyo conference. At the same time, two British technical representatives, Tianjin British Police Chief Tainsh and British Embassy Secretary to China Allen, have left Tokyo and returned to China. According to observers here, the Anglo-Japanese conference, which may be held tomorrow, will determine the fate of the Tokyo Round Table Conference. However, it is worth noting that all parties are still optimistic. (Reuters, 8th)

(London) The Japanese report that London instructions regarding the Chinese monetary system and the Tianjin British Concession Chinese silver case have been sent to the British Ambassador to Japan is inaccurate. The instructions are still under consideration but have not yet been issued. Reuters has learned that although a draft agreement on policing in the Tianjin British Concession has been drawn up, it is still under negotiation. (Reuters, 8th)

### Anti-British Demonstrations in Kobe, Japan, German and Italian Residents Participate in March

(Tokyo) There were two anti-British demonstrations in Kobe on Sunday. German and Italian residents of Kobe all participated. 100,000 people participated in the anti-British demonstrations that day. Many anti-British speeches were given, and many resolutions were passed, all demanding that the Japanese government take a tough stance against Britain. (Associated Press, 8th)

### US Continues to Buy Silver from China, Aiding China's Resistance Against Japan; 6 Million Ounces to be Purchased at Market Price; Chongqing Denies Ordering New Banknotes from Britain

(Washington) According to informed sources, the US Treasury Department has agreed to purchase six million ounces of silver from China, paying the market price at the time of delivery. It is understood that the US sets the price for purchasing foreign silver at 35 cents per ounce. Based on this calculation, the Chinese government could receive $2.1 million. However, such transactions are traditionally kept secret by the government, so the Treasury Department declined to comment. Political figures said that the US policy of buying silver from China is beneficial to China's resistance against Japan and that this policy has been decided to be continuously implemented without any relaxation. This can be seen from this. (Havas News Agency, 7th)

(Chongqing) The Central Bank authorities today formally denied recently ordering a large number of banknotes from two British companies in London. It is understood that news recently spread from London that the Chinese government and the Central Bank had signed two contracts to print over one billion banknotes in total. One of the contracts has already been completed, and the other is expected to be completed in a year. In response to this, Ministry of Finance personnel told a Reuters reporter that the London news gave the impression that the two contracts were newly signed and that the Chinese government was preparing to start inflation. In fact, the formulation of the two contracts was more than two years ago. (Reuters, 8th)

### Japanese Cabinet Meeting; Arita Reports on Diplomacy

(Tokyo) At this morning's regular cabinet meeting, the depreciation of Chinese legal tender was one of the matters discussed. Regarding the Anglo-Japanese round table conference, Foreign Minister Arita said that meetings could continue today or tomorrow, as the British representative had stated that as soon as instructions were received from his government, the meetings could resume. The instructions were just sent from London, so the Anglo-Japanese conference should be able to continue today or Wednesday after the full instructions arrive. Britain was unable to send instructions earlier because it was consulting with relevant countries on the economic issues of Tianjin, Arita continued. Regarding the Japanese oil and coal concession rights in Northern Sakhalin, Arita said that the Soviet government attaches great importance to collective labor contracts, considering them a prerequisite for resolving all outstanding issues in Northern Sakhalin. However, since the representative of the Japanese oil and coal concession rights has already signed a collective labor contract with the Far Eastern Soviet trade union, the Japanese government intends to accelerate negotiations with the Soviet government to resolve all long-standing unresolved issues in Northern Sakhalin on the basis of this contract. Arita, Minister of Commerce Hatta, and Minister of Finance Ishiwata then presented reports on the depreciation of legal tender, and the cabinet members exchanged opinions on the plan that Japan should adopt to deal with the depreciation of legal tender, which lasted about forty minutes. (Reuters, 8th)

### British Defense in Singapore Greatly Enhanced; Army and Air Force Arrive in Steady Streams; Sufficient to Resist Any Foreign Invasion

Singapore. A squadron of twin-engined Mohawk bombers flew in here yesterday from India. This flight team includes thirty-six bombers, eight transport bombers, and four airships. The air force strength here has immediately doubled. The Sunderland airship team is already here, so the arrival of this new flight team makes Singapore capable of resisting any foreign invasion. The arrival of this new flight team is extremely necessary, because the old two flight teams stationed here, except for a few new types of aircraft, are mostly old. Those who doubted the strength of the Singapore air force have been completely relieved since the new team that flew in from India yesterday arrived here. The Agal Army team also arrived here this morning. Eight thousand soldiers will arrive here later this week. (Associated Press, 8th)

(Singapore) A large British army unit and three Indian army units have now arrived here from India. To date, 4,000 troops have arrived here from India. One battalion belonging to the 14th Ben Zhepu Regiment, which arrived here today, will travel by train to Penang tomorrow. At least two more ships loaded with troops will arrive here this week, including artillerymen, sappers, medical teams, etc., carrying complete equipment, such as artillery and ambulances. (Reuters, 8th)

### Roosevelt Signs Bill Adjusting US-Philippine Economy; British Newspaper Says US Retention of Philippines Will Be Cornerstone of Far East Peace

(Washington) President Roosevelt today signed a bill adjusting the relationship between the United States and the Philippines to prepare for Philippine independence in 1946. The bill stipulates the duty-free amount of coconut oil, embroidery, tobacco, and buttons imported from the Philippines to the United States until 1946. (Reuters, 7th)

(London) The Daily Telegraph said that the United States' relationship with the Philippine Islands will be a serious issue in American politics. If the United States implements its announced intention to establish an independent Philippine Republic in 1946, it will lead to the evil consequence of the Philippines being invaded by Japan. This is certainly not the original intention of the US plan. Previous proposals to amend the method of Philippine independence have not been welcomed by the Filipino people. However, the Far East incident may now make them have a second thought about maintaining the benefits of the American flag. The United States may listen to the Filipinos' self-determination, and the main factor in shaping Filipino public opinion will be the success or failure of Japan's continental ambitions. MacArthur, who resigned as Resident Commissioner to the Philippines a few weeks ago, recently gave a speech at the University of Virginia in the United States, arguing that the United States should not abandon the Philippines, saying that if the United States abandons it, it will lose its right to speak in Eastern diplomacy and make the islands between Kamchatka and Borneo in the hands of foreigners, becoming a blockade line for US-China trade. Many Filipinos know that from a spiritual standpoint, independence is very pleasant to hear, but independence may become a transfer of sovereignty. To solve this problem, there is a strategy: in the political aspect, the United States maintains its flag and sovereignty in the Philippines, allowing the Filipinos as much autonomy as possible, but still holding the rights to diplomacy, tariffs, immigration, currency, and public debt. In the event of an incident, the United States should assist in maintaining the civil foundation of the Philippine government. In the economic aspect, the United States gives the Filipinos the best opportunity for trade, limited to not harming American producers. If the United States and the Philippines establish a permanent political and economic relationship, it will be the best method, because the Filipinos are willing to have it, and the United States is not imposing sovereignty on others. When the American flag hangs in the Philippines, the Philippines will be the cornerstone of the structure of peace in the Far East. Once the American flag is removed, turmoil will follow for at least a generation. (Reuters, 8th)

### Anti-Chinese Movement in Siam Instigated by Japan; Propaganda Also Directed at Burma

(Chongqing) According to news from here today, the recent anti-Chinese movement in Siam was mostly instigated by Japanese propaganda. At the same time, Japan is now also vigorously conducting propaganda in Burma in order to alienate Burma's relationship with China. The Japanese method of propaganda is to say that since the completion of the Burma Road, many Chinese laborers have traveled along the road to Burma. If Burma does not prohibit this, it will affect the relationship between Burma and China, because Chinese laborers have low wages, which may affect the lives of Burmese workers. (Associated Press, 8th)

(London) It is rumored that the Kingdom of Siam (newly renamed Thailand) has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Siamese embassy here firmly denied this. (Havas News Agency, 8th)

### True Record of a Southwest Journey

Zhennanguan is a military fortress, so there are no markets or villages there except for the gate and public offices. All daily necessities are obtained from Aikou, more than ten miles away from the gate. The Longzhou Customs Branch is located here. Foreign travelers and goods must be inspected here, so the market in Aikou has gradually prospered. It gathers merchants, drivers, and government transportation personnel. The number of hotels and inns has gradually increased. By noon, it is bustling with noise. Cars can be received from inside the town to outside the town, stretching for one or two miles, slowly waiting for inspection one by one. When the traffic is crowded, it can take a day and a half, so in reality, Zhennanguan cannot be considered Aikou, but it is really a difficult pass. From Fengxiang to Nanning, the route passes through Mingjiang and two ferry crossings. The river surface from Mingjiang Ferry to outside Nanning City is wider, and there are many ferry boats, so it may not take much time.

After Nanning was bombed, the market is not as good as before. Most stores on the most prosperous Minsheng Road and Xingning Road open after 3 pm. Most of the goods have been evacuated to the opposite bank outside the city, so Delin Road is quite lively. It is said that prices are cheaper here than in Liuzhou and above. Most stores can only maintain the status quo and cannot talk about development, but several new banks have opened, such as the China Farmers Bank, which has already opened, so finance is quite active. The most strange thing is that exchanging Vietnamese currency here is cheaper than in Vietnam, which travelers should know.

6. Liuzhou, the Center of Transportation

Liuzhou is located in the center of Guangxi. The Guinan section of the future Hunan-Guangxi Railway and various highways must pass through it. The waterway controls the hub of the Liujiang River. Downstream, it can directly reach Wuzhou, so after the outbreak of the war, it became one of the centers of transportation in the Southwest. From Nanning to here, the entire journey is 260 kilometers, and the journey takes about eight hours, but north of Binyang, you must cross the main stream and tributary of the Qianjiang River twice, which takes a lot of time. The scenery on this line is very good. North of Qianjiang, mountains rise from the flat ground. The car winds through the mountains with no support, and there is really a situation of beautiful scenery that cannot be fully appreciated. Especially north of Datang, there are sixty miles of continuous mountain peaks, which can be called the Yellowstone Park of China without any shame.

Binyang is the branching point of the highways to Guixian and Wuzhou, and Datang is the branching point of the highways to Guiyang, so these two places occupy an important position on the Yiliu line. Generally, people from Liuzhou or Guixian to Nanning, or from Guixian to Liuzhou, mostly have lunch in Binyang. Those from Nanning or Yishan to Liuzhou mostly have lunch in Datang.

Liuzhou is surrounded by the Liujiang River. Hebei is the urban area, and Henan is the industrial and transportation area. Vehicles from all directions are concentrated in Henan. The tool for crossing the river used to be a pontoon bridge, which was very convenient. Recently, it was washed away by a flood, so you have to use ferries. There is now an electric ferry that travels back and forth every ten minutes. In addition, there are many small cabin ships that also carry passengers, departing when there are twelve people, costing five cents per person. If there are few people and you want to depart early, you have to pay this amount.

People with slightly inferior foot strength feel overwhelmed by the uphill and downhill slopes when crossing the river, so for the convenience of taking a car, it is advisable to live in Henan. If you want to stay for a few days, it is better to live in Hebei. Even from a safety point of view, although there are many caves in Henan, Hebei has not been bombed so far. This is also one of the reasons why I advocate living in Hebei.

There are always more than one hundred cars of various types running every night to morning in the Henan area. There are really a lot of passing guests, so travelers and hotels are extremely developed. However, these kinds of hotels do not welcome long-term guests. Most of the hotels are simple and crude, and there is no equipment at all. The reception of the tea room is even more careless. Except for a brief moment in the morning when they are slightly nervous to greet guests to get on the car, the rest of the time, they ignore you when you call them, either dozing off or humming a tune, so conflicts between guests and tea rooms are commonplace.

The market in Hebei only has three horizontal streets, intertwined with four or five straight streets. Among them, Peixin Road, which is directly opposite the ferry terminal, and Qingyun Road to the north are the most lively, forming a T-shape horizontally and vertically. All bookstores, banks, and restaurants are concentrated on these two streets. Qingyun Road in particular has become the cultural street of Liuzhou. The Commercial Press and other bookstores are all located here.

Speaking of food, you can actually taste the flavors of various places in Liuzhou. Not to mention Guangdong restaurants, other restaurants such as Beijing restaurants, Sichuan restaurants, and even Shandong restaurants and Ningbo restaurants are available, but the prices are expensive. However, because there are many passing guests, every family is crowded. However, banquets are mostly held in the evening. At noon, they are afraid of air raids, so the stores operate with their doors half-closed. Although other restaurants do not have this situation, many are afraid that guests will leave in a rush after eating halfway and encountering an air raid without paying the bill, so they collect the money first. The most interesting thing is the tea room. You pay each time you take a plate of dim sum, which has the flavor of a foreign automatic "wheel taking" machine. (To be continued)

### Statistics of Japanese Aircraft Disturbing Zhejiang in the Past Six Months; Over Two Thousand Bombs Dropped

Fangyan Communication, In the past six months, the Japanese navy has been conducting guerrilla harassment along the Chinese coast, and has also been wantonly bombing with airplanes. According to the Zhejiang Provincial Government War Industry report, the following statistics have been compiled from various places. From January to June of this year, the counties in the province were air raided by Japanese aircraft a total of 625 times, dropping 2,000 bombs, destroying 2,408 houses, injuring 444 people, and killing 336 people. The houses destroyed had little military value, and the people killed and injured were not military personnel. On average, Japanese aircraft drop one bomb and destroy one and a half houses, and injure less than one person. Japanese aircraft must drop six bombs to kill one old and weak Chinese person.

### Chinese Army on the Border of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui; Operates Under Cover of the Green Screen; Annihilates Japanese Troops by the Bu Lao River; Railway Tracks on the Jinpu and Longhai Lines Destroyed; Wounded Japanese Soldiers Gather in Xuzhou

Xuzhou Communication, The Japanese army headquarters in Xuzhou considers the undulating mountains and green screen everywhere on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong northeast of Xuzhou to be the base camp for the lurking activities of the Chinese guerrilla teams. The Japanese commander Washizu specially dispatched more than 200 mechanized soldiers on six large trucks, with one tank, and carrying four heavy artillery pieces, departing from Liuquan Jiawang, crossing the Bu Lao River in Huzhuang, attempting to sweep the Chinese army in the Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui border area from the northeastern mountains. The Han Zhilong unit of the column reported in advance, and first ambushed some of its troops in several directions. When the Japanese army was halfway across the river, it launched a joint encirclement and attack. Although the Japanese army relied on its fierce artillery fire to cover and the tanks and cars charged horizontally and vertically, the artillery fire and tanks were ineffective due to the undulating terrain, rocky terrain, and the obstruction and concealment of the sorghum stalks. The Chinese army was even more familiar with the terrain, and surrounded the Japanese army. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was unable to support itself, so it concentrated its firepower on one point and broke through the encirclement and fled the next morning. In this battle, 48 Japanese officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, and two cars were destroyed. The Chinese army also suffered 13 casualties, and seized 19 boxes of artillery shells, 52 rounds of machine gun bullets, seven pairs of leather boots, and 12 meal bags.

Also, guerrilla teams of the Chinese army in Xuzhou, Huaihai and other places are now actively using the green screen for concealment. In addition to attacking Japanese barracks and intercepting important information from time to time, they are also continuing to destroy the railway tracks on the Jinpu and Longhai lines, and the highways in the counties are also cut off from time to time. The Japanese army is unable to defend against it, and recently specially increased the number of defense troops at each station along the Jinpu and Longhai lines, and forcibly drafted strong men, trained them, and assigned them to protect the roads. They also forced the people to cut down all the sorghum within 1,200 meters on both sides of the railway, but the people ignored it.

The Washizu Division of the Japanese army in Xuzhou has been attacked by the Chinese army from time to time in eastern Henan, northern Anhui, and southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu, and has suffered heavy casualties. The dead are mostly cremated on the spot, and the ashes are transported back to the country to the north. Those who are lightly wounded are sent to field hospitals for treatment, and those who are seriously wounded are sent to Tianjin starting from July 20th, with four sections attached to the trains going north from Xubei. About 150 people are transported from Xubei every day. As for the Chinese compatriots from the Northeast or other places who are conscripted, those who are slightly injured in combat are treated, and those who are slightly more seriously injured are cremated together with the dead. Therefore, in the crematorium in the south of Xuzhou, there are often cries for help from Chinese compatriots who are burned due to injuries, and those who hear it are saddened.

### Japanese Army in Jiaxing; Conscripts Laborers; Over 500 People Have Been Conscripted

Jiaxing Communication, The puppet county government recently received instructions from the Japanese side to conscript laborers to rush to build a military highway in the suburbs of Jiaxing to Jiashan. The puppet county chief Shen Hanqing convened a joint meeting of various puppet ward and baojia chiefs, deciding that able-bodied men aged 17 to 37 must serve three days a month. If they do not obey the order to report, they will be fined 30 cents per person per day. If they deliberately resist, they will be severely punished according to military law. However, since the various puppet ward chiefs have been organizing it, it has been difficult to implement it for a while due to various difficulties, and the Japanese army has been urging it strictly. The puppet county government was unable to cope with it, so it secretly instructed the Japanese army to conscript, and instigated the Japanese side, so that the Japanese army went to various transportation hubs to conscript in large numbers at noon the other day. It is said that more than 500 people were conscripted.

### Currency System in the Occupied Areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang; Great Chaos; People Believe in Legal Tender; Refuse to Use Counterfeit Money in Circulation

Suzhou Communication, Since the use of Jinlu Han banknotes in Shanghai has affected the occupied areas, the situation in the Jinghu Hangzhou area is special. In addition to the legal tender of the central Jiao Nong Si Hang, Japanese currency, military notes, and "Huaxing" counterfeit money are also commonly used in the market. Other legal tender from the five provinces in North China and banknotes from the local banks in Anhui, Zhejiang, and Xuzhou are not commonly used, resulting in extreme chaos in the market. The puppet side took the opportunity to wheel in counterfeit money and force the people to use it, but the people still absolutely believe in legal tender, and the central Jiao Nong Si Hang is the most popular among the people. Furthermore, because copper coins have disappeared, they are replaced by stamps, or each acts on its own and issues bamboo coin tokens, which are randomly mixed and used. It is true that the people in the occupied areas are in a situation where they cannot get what they want and cannot find a way to die. In places like Nanjing, the general poor people and illiterate poor people suffer greatly because they cannot find a place to exchange the Jiao votes from the Xuzhou Guanqian Bureau and the Anhui Bank after receiving them. There have been riots in which stores were destroyed. The puppet side was greatly alarmed, so it explained to the merchants and persuaded them to continue to accept the Xuzhou and Anhui Jiao votes without discounts, and arrested several store owners who refused to use them, fining them to appease the general small-scale vendors. In fact, they are still forcing the use of counterfeit money, falsely claiming that North China has refused to use the old legal tender. Rumors are rife, and it is difficult to stabilize.

### Intentions of the Japanese Army's Invasion of Zhongshan; To Rob and Harvest Mature Rice; Japanese Warships Have Already Retreated from Hengmen

Hong Kong Communication, For two weeks, the Japanese army invading Guangdong has invaded Zhongshan in three routes, by land and sea, and fierce battles have occurred along the coast of Zhongshan County. In mid-July, the situation in Zhongshan suddenly became tense, and the authorities had already prepared for it. On the 24th, the Japanese army indeed mobilized two gunboats and several speedboats from Humen and berthed at the Hengmen estuary in Zhongshan. At about 3 pm, 600 to 700 Japanese soldiers were transported by transport ships, and they took more than 40 speedboats to rush into the Hengmen blockade line. They first removed the obstacles and then fired artillery from the Japanese warships to bombard the shore, destroying the defense positions of the shore defense troops. The Japanese Marines then landed on the perimeter of Hengmen Inner River. At that time, the Chinese defense forces fought fiercely, sacrificing more than half of them. In the end, because of the disparity in numbers and the difficulty in resisting the fierce bombardment of the Japanese artillery, they moved their positions to Maoshengwei. On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese army advanced inland, occupied Ma'anshan along the coast, and suddenly advanced to Xiaomen. When they reached Xiaomen, they divided their troops to harass Mazi. One route crossed Maoshengwei and approached Dagangshan. The 5th, 6th, and 7th companies of the Zhongshan defense forces blocked and attacked separately. Fierce battles took place in the surrounding fields and in the area of Mazixiang. The 7th company suffered heavy casualties and retreated to Banzishan and other places in Maosheng. At the same time, the Japanese army moved the Dagangshan artillery position to Pinglangshan. At dusk, the Chinese army counterattacked Yangtianluo (place name) and held each other with the Japanese army on Xingling until dawn. The Japanese army opened fire remotely again. In order to avoid artillery fire, the Chinese army withdrew beyond the range of the Japanese steel guns, using Xiaqishan at the junction of Shanzhou and Licun as a harassment point. The Japanese army then occupied Dongliwei, completely looting the rice and livestock in the area. At the same time, they used speedboats to remove the mines at the Hengmen estuary. The Japanese army wanted to invade Xiaqishan to spy on Shiqi, so they invaded Licun again. On the evening of the 29th, the two sides fought a night battle again and finally invaded the village, hoping to advance to Shiqi City along the highway. The next day (30th), the Japanese army sent planes to bomb Dachuan Village near Shiqi, in order to prevent the Chinese army from reinforcing. Hundreds of houses in the nearby villages were destroyed by Japanese bombs. The situation in Shiqi was particularly tense at this time. People dispersed one after another, and those who walked to Qianshan and Macau to take refuge were endless. The Zhongshan overseas compatriots temporarily lived in Macau and set up a relief association to accommodate the refugees. The Qiguan Highway passenger car was changed to night travel to avoid Japanese air raids, but the driving was uncertain and the traffic was extremely congested. As for the waterway from Shiqi to Macau, all inland river vessels were completely suspended due to the Japanese warships. On the 28th, Japanese warships once approached the inner river of Leishi in Shiqi and bombarded Shiqi, eight shells landed in the city, destroying many houses in the Old Prison Street and Shizi Street, and killing and injuring dozens of people. The stone fortress is located in the west of Shiqi. Although the Japanese shallow-water warships can sail there, the sailors did not dare to land. However, it is just a kind of restraint. On the 30th, the Chinese army reinforced, one route guarded Xiaqishan, and the other route attacked from Mazi. Because the Japanese army was weak and this time was purely to rob and harvest rice and stored grain in Zhongshan (Zhongshan has always been famous for producing rice), they used artillery to control it on the one hand, and sent engineers to rob and harvest the mature rice as much as possible. Therefore, the grain produced in Qiqingwei, Shiqingwei, Suishengwei, Boliwei, Maodewei, and other rice fields was almost entirely taken by the Japanese army. After holding each other for about a week, the Japanese army's robbing and harvesting work was about to be completed. The harvested grain was transported away by ships. It seems that this goal has been achieved and there is no intention to attack Shiqi again. It is said that the Japanese warships in Hengmen have begun to retreat. This kind of action is purely a kind of looting career, and has no great political significance. (August 2nd)

### Japanese Warships Blockade Fujian's Maritime Trade: Sunken Civilian Vessels off Fuzhou and Quanzhou; Mines Planted for Long-Term Blockade

Fuzhou Dispatch: Japanese warships, numbering as many as thirty, concentrated off the coast of Minhou, Lianjiang, Changle, and Fuqing counties at the mouth of the Min River during late June and early July. They incessantly bombed Fuzhou, Yanping, Xinghua, and various locations on both banks of the Min River mouth, including Changmen, Meihua, Guantou, Min'an, and Mawei. Simultaneously, they colluded with pirates to seize islands in the eastern Fujian Sea, such as Haitan (Pingtan County), Chuanshi, Nanri, Dongsha, Nangantang, and Mazu'ao, attempting to threaten Fuzhou. However, due to the strict and comprehensive defense arrangements along the Chinese coast, the Japanese found no opportunity to exploit. Instead, they sank hundreds of civilian vessels seized along the coast and laid mines off Chuanshi Island at the mouth of the Min River, creating a blockade to prevent ships of all nations from navigating the area. They then shifted their focus to southern Fujian. On July 14th, some warships from the mouth of the Min River were sent to the waters off Quanzhou port, with fifteen Japanese warships and ten speedboats anchored off the coast of Jinjiang and Hui'an counties. They notified the Quanzhou Taikoo & Co. that they would land at 8:00 AM on the 15th. Upon hearing this news, the people of Quanzhou became extremely anxious, and many fled overnight to nearby Nan'an, Yongchun counties, and rural areas. Around 9:00 AM on the 15th, Japanese warships indeed dispatched three speedboats carrying over forty soldiers, who secretly landed at Dakou in Hui'an County and conducted extensive searches. However, they retreated around 2:00 PM. After the 16th, due to the intense counterattack by Chinese forces in the Chaozhou-Shantou area and the escalating situation, the Japanese warships off Quanzhou port and the mouth of the Min River were sent to reinforce those areas, leaving only five or six ships behind, with little activity. However, the Japanese warships in Quanzhou port, imitating the methods used at the mouth of the Min River, looted over a hundred civilian vessels along the coast, transporting the food and goods on board to Dazhui Island for storage. They stationed sailors on the island to monitor the goods and observe the movement of ships, while simultaneously sinking vessels in the waters off the mouth of Quanzhou port, attempting a long-term blockade. As a result, no ships can enter or leave the commercial ports of Fuzhou and Quanzhou, and foreign trade has come to a standstill.

### Japanese Troops in Huai'an Attempt to Invade in Three Routes, Failing in Their Ambition; Puppet Maintenance Committee Chairman Arrested

Huai'an Dispatch: The day before yesterday afternoon, over a hundred Japanese and puppet troops, armed with small cannons and machine guns, left the south gate and advanced towards Yueqiao in three routes. One route, consisting of about twenty soldiers wearing white cloth shirts and pants, advanced from Longguang Pavilion in a zigzag formation, attempting to blend in with the Chinese civilians. Another route, consisting of about forty soldiers wearing military uniforms of varying blue and white colors, advanced from the southern bank of the Shi Dai River. A third route, consisting of about forty soldiers wearing gray-yellow military uniforms, advanced towards Yueqiao from the barren fields of Chen Zhaobin behind Longguang Pavilion. They were followed by thirty or forty coolies carrying wheat stalks and fuel, preparing to set fire. As the three routes of Japanese and puppet troops left the city, they continuously fired small cannons and machine guns, and when they reached the north and south bridges, they encountered a fierce battle with a battalion of the Chinese army. The artillery fire from both sides was intense. Platoon Leader Tong Ying fired three consecutive mortar shells at the Japanese troops from the west of Heshangzhuang. The Japanese troops retaliated with seven small cannons from the north and south bridges, with the shells landing in the bathing ponds and rice paddies of Wang San Hotel in Heshangzhuang. During the intense fighting, the Japanese troops ordered dozens of coolies to set fire to the houses along both banks of the north and south bridges, destroying forty to fifty houses. Seeing the fire in front, the Chinese troops bravely advanced, with the battalion commander personally directing the charge at the front line, while simultaneously sending a team to encircle the Japanese troops from the rear. By around 4:00 PM, the Japanese troops were tightly surrounded. Seeing their retreat cut off, the Japanese troops stubbornly resisted. At this time, the Japanese troops on the West Gate artillery platform, seeing the Japanese troops outside the city surrounded by the Chinese army, continuously bombarded the Chinese troops with small cannons. The Japanese troops also used small cannons and machine guns as cover, allowing them to retreat into the city. In this battle, seven or eight Japanese and puppet troops were killed or wounded, along with one horse. The Chinese army suffered one platoon leader, Zhu Changchun, killed in action, and five or six soldiers wounded. Several civilians were also killed or wounded.

After the puppet vice-chairman of the Huai'an puppet Maintenance Committee, Ding Zhenchang, was captured by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops ordered the committee to move into the city to operate. The puppet chairman, Ye Yangwen, accepted the order and entered the city. However, the puppet Director of Public Security, Yu Bing'ou, the puppet Director of Security, Zheng Houzhi, and the puppet Youth Corps Leader, Dong Bing, set up barriers and only opened them once when there were many people. After 3:00 PM, they completely prohibited entry and exit. Yu and others also engaged in forced extortion, leaving no evil deeds undone, causing the people to suffer immensely. Furthermore, the puppet Director of Security and Youth Corps Leader of Huai'an, Liu Binshan, and the puppet Secretary of the Maintenance Committee, Li Fubin, are now suspected by the Japanese troops of harboring intentions to defect and have been placed under surveillance.

### Chinese Army Kills Japanese Troops at the South Gate of Jiangyin

Jiangyin Dispatch: The Shizi Street area near the south gate, up to Duanming Bridge, is primarily an industrial zone. After the war, the area is sparsely populated. The Yingfu Bridge, located nearby, is well under the control of the guerilla forces. The Japanese troops stationed ten soldiers in the ancestral hall of the Qian family, located between Shizi Street and Duanming Bridge, to check passengers on the ships and passing vessels and to levy exorbitant taxes. Around 11:00 AM on the 2nd of this month, three Japanese soldiers went to the bridge to purchase goods and were suddenly attacked by the guerrilla forces, resulting in the immediate death of two soldiers. The guerrillas then threw a grenade to demonstrate their strength. After about ten minutes, the Japanese troops rushed out from the city. The residents of the boatmen community in Shizi Street outside the south gate fled. The Japanese troops conducted a house-to-house search, and after several hours, the Japanese troops retreated back into the city.

### Shanghai to Resume Alert State from This Morning; Full Mobilization and Joint Defense by Both Concessions; Roads Leading to Western District All Blocked

The precautions of the Public and French Concessions went into effect, one after the other, starting from 10:30 last night. Their planning and defense are more comprehensive and meticulous than before. On the French Concession side, after 10:30 PM, the major entrances and exits along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch were first sealed off. Except for Rue Jules Ferry, Rue de la Caserne, Avenue des Soeurs, Rue Amiral Bayle, Avenue de Notre Dame, and Avenue Albert, which were left as entrances and exits and had armed soldiers and detectives stationed to strictly inspect all pedestrians and vehicles, the remaining entrances and exits of all roads were blocked with barbed wire, temporarily cutting off traffic. On the Public Concession side, preparations began around midnight. All roads in the bustling city area that lead to Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch were restricted in the same way as the French Concession. For example, the Bund, Jiangxi Road, Henan Road, Shandong Road, Zhejiang Road, Guangxi Road, Yunnan Road, Avenue Edward Ezra, and Chengdu Road were all cut off to traffic, while Sichuan Road, Fujian Road, Nanking Road, Race Course Road, Chongqing Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road, Hardoon Road, and Hart Road were left with only side roads for access, which were also subject to strict inspection. Armored vehicles and security vehicles were also dispatched to patrol within their respective boundaries, especially in the border areas, where the defenses were even tighter.

Special Precautions Started Early

The second anniversary of the Shanghai Battle is approaching. For the sake of safety within their boundaries, the authorities of the two concessions in this city have adopted joint precautionary measures and banned any gatherings starting from the 6th. The work of searching pedestrians on the roads has also been intensified. In view of the tense situation, it has been decided to start special precautions from this morning. All police personnel in the two concessions have been fully mobilized. As for traffic on the roads, it is not intended to be blocked except on the 13th. These precautions will last until late at night on the 15th, when they may be lifted. However, if the situation is good, they may be shortened temporarily.

Shanghai Volunteer Corps Ordered to Mobilize

The headquarters of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, commanded by General Fessenden, has been ordered to summon all national members of the corps. After receiving the order, General Fessenden issued an order this morning to prepare for full mobilization. The units include: 1. The light cavalry of the cavalry regiment, the American cavalry regiment; 2. The armored car company and the C-type machine gun company of the combined regiment, and the translation team of the Chinese company; 3. The British A and B companies, the Scottish company, the Jewish company, and the anti-aircraft company of the A-type battalion; 4. The American, Filipino, Portuguese, and other companies of the B-type battalion, and the American machine gun company; 5. The White Russian Volunteer Company of the D-type battalion have all been mobilized. From 6:00 AM tomorrow, they must wear uniforms and go to the writing office to work, ready to report for duty and move out within ten minutes of receiving the order. The armored car company will move out first.

Traffic in the Suburbs to be Blocked

The Japanese and puppet sides are deeply afraid that Chinese guerrillas will take the opportunity to launch a surprise attack and are extremely panicked. Therefore, they have already built defensive fortifications in the four suburbs of Shanghai, added Japanese and puppet troops and police to guard them, and will block traffic in the Pujiang, Beixinjing, Minhang, and Zhabei areas. All small boats operating on the inland rivers will be temporarily suspended from the 12th.

"Badlands" of Western Shanghai to be Blocked

According to the North-China Daily News, at 5:00 AM on the morning of the 9th, the defense forces and police of the Public and French Concessions will mobilize to prepare for the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle. At that time, Shanghai will resume the familiar scene of armed defense. Today (the 8th) throughout the day and early tomorrow morning, public works department coolies are erecting barbed wire barriers in various parts of the city. All bridges and roads leading to the "badlands" of western Shanghai will be blocked.

Precautions More Stringent Than Before

According to an announcement by the headquarters of the Public Concession Police Department yesterday, the precautionary measures will be the same as those implemented last year, but will be generally strengthened. The curfew will remain unchanged but will be strictly enforced regardless of nationality. Extra police patrols will patrol the troublesome western, central, and Putu Road factory areas, as well as the Bund. British defense forces, the US Marine Corps, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will assist the police in maintaining patrols and search teams in various districts.

Special Police to Deploy This Morning

Special police are scheduled to deploy at 5:00 AM tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning) to assume their duties, which will last until the "dispersal" order is issued on August 14th. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps will carry full equipment and be on standby from 5:00 AM tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning) at their offices until 5:00 AM on Sunday morning. The French Concession authorities will implement the measures taken on the anniversary of the July 7th incident and will fully cooperate with the Public Concession authorities. During the precautions, all defense forces in this port will be recalled from leave so that every soldier can effectively perform their duties.

### Japan Plans to Monopolize All of China's Shipping Industry: Organization of the East Asia Shipping Company; North and South Seas Shipping Routes Included; Third-Party Shipping Industry Devastated

After the coastal ports and Yangtze River waterways of China were occupied by the Japanese army, foreign shipping vessels were regarded with extreme suspicion, with numerous instances of obstructing shipping and detaining ships. However, Japanese merchants were still unable to exclusively enjoy the benefits, feeling dissatisfied. Therefore, they meticulously planned to achieve their goals. Thus, a large-scale shipping organization has recently been formed. The following is a brief overview of the organization:

Organization of the East Asia Shipping Company

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all coastal areas were under Japanese control. Subsequently, as the Chinese army retreated westward, Japanese warships sailed up the Yangtze River, and Nanjing, Jiujiang, and Hankou fell one after another, the entire Yangtze River was occupied. The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha took the opportunity to resume operations, falsely claiming military transport, resulting in a thriving loan and transport business. Although foreign merchants repeatedly proposed to resume shipping, the Japanese side used military reasons as an excuse, preventing them from doing so. Therefore, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha continues to exclusively enjoy the profits. However, it is unable to exclusively enjoy the benefits in South and North China, feeling dissatisfied and constantly seeking a solution. Thus, the large-scale "East Asia Shipping Company" organization was formed, and the inaugural meeting was held in Tokyo on the 5th of this month, with a capital of 73 million yen. The organization is composed of Japanese shipping companies.

Most Japanese Ships Join

As for ships, they are allocated by various companies. The capital is estimated based on the value of the allocated ships. The companies in this city include Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line), Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK Line), Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (NKK Line), Kinkai Yusen Kaisha (KYK Line) (formerly managed by NYK Line), Mitsui Bussan Kaisha, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K Line), Okazaki Kisen Kaisha, Awa Kuni Kyodo Kisen Kaisha, Harada Kisen Kaisha, Yamashita Kisen Kaisha, and Daito Kaiun Co., Ltd., a total of eleven companies. However, Dalian Kisen Kaisha, Showa Kisen Kaisha, and Kokusai Kaiun Kaisha have not participated. In the future, branches will be established in sixteen trading ports in China, Taiwan, and Japan. The Shanghai branch is rumored to be located within Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, but this has not been confirmed as it has not yet been established. In addition to the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's routes on the Yangtze River, the NYK Line's Sino-Japanese connecting lines' Huashan Maru, Songshan Maru, Tangshan Maru, and Lushan Maru, and the Osaka Shosen Kaisha's Fuzhou, Taiwan, and Keelung routes' Changsha Maru and Fujian Maru, among others, will be transferred to the management of the new company. Some of the staff will also be transferred to the new company. The date of realization of the organization is still uncertain.

Capital of 73 Million Yen

The detailed internal organization of the general office of the organization is listed as follows: (1) Name: East Asia Shipping Joint Stock Company; (2) General Office: Tokyo; (3) Capital: 73 million yen; (4) Objectives: A. Engaging in maritime transport between Japan and China, between coastal ports of China, and between China and foreign countries; B. Operating wharves and warehouses; C. Engaging in related businesses and investing in related enterprises.

Eleven Shipping Routes Operated

(5) Eleven shipping routes operated: Between Japan and Tianjin, between Japan and Qingdao, between Japan and Shanghai, between Japan and South China, between Taiwan and Shanghai, between Taiwan and Tianjin, between Taiwan and South China, between Dalian and North China, between Tianjin and Shanghai, between Tianjin and South China, and between Dalian and South China. The Yangtze River is not included. Sixteen branch offices are established, with locations roughly as follows: Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Kobe, Moji, Nagasaki, Taipei, Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and five other locations.

### British Ship Bombed by Japanese Aircraft in Yichang; Britain has Lodged a Protest; Japanese Naval Authorities Deny the Incident; However, it has been Handed over to the Army Authorities for Investigation

According to the Continental Daily News, Rear Admiral Holt, commander of the British Yangtze Patrol Flotilla, has recently lodged two protests with Vice Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura, commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet in Chinese waters, against the bombing of the Asiatic Petroleum Company's property and two Jardine Matheson & Co. ships during the Japanese air raid on Yichang on Sunday. It is reported that Nomura has replied that the air raid was not related to Japanese naval aircraft, but the matter is currently being handed over to the army authorities for further investigation. A Japanese naval spokesman also denied bombing Yichang by naval aircraft at a press conference yesterday (the 7th). An army spokesman said that the air raid is currently under investigation by the army authorities and that if the information received here is correct, the bombing of British property and ships was a "most regrettable accident." He had not received official information on the air raid and therefore did not know the details.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Zhenhai Yesterday; Fire in the City; Details Unknown

According to a telegram received by a shipping company, Japanese aircraft invaded Zhenhai airspace again yesterday morning (the 8th), dropping six bombs, which immediately caused a fire in the city. Due to the brevity of the telegram, the details are unknown, but it is generally believed that the damage will not be severe, as residents have already evacuated voluntarily.

Shipping Between Shanghai and Zhenhai Not Obstructed

Although there has been shelling by Japanese warships and bombing by Japanese aircraft in the Zhenhai port area in recent days, shipping between Shanghai and Zhenhai has not been obstructed. Outbound ships are operating as usual. The Italian merchant vessel Poli of Yihua Foreign Company returned to Shanghai at 4:00 AM yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in port at 5:00 PM. The German merchant vessel Moufu of Lihe Foreign Company left Zhenhai this morning and is scheduled to arrive in port at 4:00 PM this afternoon, with a return voyage scheduled for the morning of the 12th. Currently, the Hana and Deping are still anchored outside Zhenhai port unloading passengers and cargo and will return to Shanghai one after the other in the coming days.

Ende Approved to Join Shipping

Since the resumption of indirect transportation on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, the Moufu, Deping, Hana, and Poli have been approved by the Ningbo Garrison Command to operate. It has now been learned that the Italian merchant vessel Ende of Zhongyi Company has also been approved to operate and is scheduled to close customs on the 9th of this month and make its first voyage to Ningbo at 4:00 AM on the 10th (Thursday). The ship will dock at the Wa滩 Garden Wharf.

### Shanghai West Guerilla Forces in Contact with Japanese Troops; Opposing Lines Less Than 100 Yards Apart; Clear Gunfire Audible Late at Night

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, guerrilla attacks on Japanese garrisons near Xujiahui and Hongqiao are becoming more frequent. Last night (the 7th), a small engagement was heard near the French Concession, with rifle fire lasting for ten minutes. It is estimated that the opposing lines are less than 100 yards apart. Residents of Route Mayne claim that in the past few days, they have heard heavy artillery fire similar to mortars and field guns coming from the west.

### Eurasia Aviation Corporation Resumes Northwest Routes; Southwest Routes Slightly Changed

The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's northwest routes were mostly suspended due to the war situation. As the situation in the northwest has stabilized and there are many passengers, the routes have been gradually resumed. The routes flying to the southwestern provinces have always been in operation, but there have been occasional changes. The following is a list of the company's recent flight schedules for the southwest and northwest routes:

Chongqing-Kunming Route: Southbound on Mondays, Fridays, and Saturdays; Northbound on Wednesdays and Fridays.

Chongqing-Guilin Route: Southbound on Thursdays; Northbound on Fridays.

Chongqing-Chengdu Route: Westbound on Fridays; Eastbound on Saturdays.

Chongqing-Xi'an Route: Northbound on Wednesdays; Southbound on Thursdays.

Xi'an-Lanzhou Route: Westbound on Wednesdays; Eastbound on Thursdays.

Chongqing-Guilin-Hong Kong Route: Southbound on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays; Arriving in Chongqing on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

Chengdu-Xi'an Route: Round trip on Mondays, but the northbound schedule is not yet fixed.

Lanzhou-Xining Route: Round trip on Thursdays.

Lanzhou-Qinghai Route: Round trip every Friday.

Kunming-Hanoi Route: Round trip every Tuesday and Saturday.

Chengdu-Kunming Route: Round trip every Tuesday.

Lanzhou-Liangzhou Route: Round trip every Friday.

Note: The Chengdu-Lanzhou route is a direct route from Chengdu to Lanzhou. There was no service on this route before, but it has recently been established. The one-way fare is said to be 470 yuan per person. The fares for the other routes remain unchanged from the previous prices.

### Tight Foreign Exchange, Buyers Waiting and Watching; Coal Market Stagnates; All Goods Continue to Rise to 2-3 Yuan; Japanese Coal Competes for Sale, No One Asks

Due to the repeated tightening of foreign exchange in the black market, the coal market saw all goods skyrocket by 2-3 yuan yesterday. Buyers were at a loss, temporarily suspending purchases, and the entire transaction stagnated. The use of coal briquettes has also decreased. Japanese coal is competing for sale in the market, but few people are interested. The firewood and charcoal industry is collectively discussing uniform prices, but the city is in the summer season, and fuel use is scarce, so there is no impact. The following is a detailed record of the situation:

Coal Market: All Goods Slightly Increased

A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the coal market yesterday that the market was affected by the repeated tightening of foreign exchange in the black market, which fell to 4 pence, causing the spot market to skyrocket to 2-3 yuan per ton, resulting in market confusion. Buyers were at a loss, and the entire market transaction stagnated, closing early. According to a leader in the industry, the current coal market, except for Indian Kailuan coal, Japanese coal is competing for sale in the market, but few people are interested, and the selling price is relatively low. There are still more than 30,000 tons of Indian coal in stock.

Coal Briquettes and Firewood Charcoal: Uniform Selling Price

The Coal Briquette Industry Association held a committee meeting earlier and collectively discussed uniform selling prices for various coal briquettes. All transactions will be made at the newly set prices starting from August 1st. There are a total of 18 coal briquette factories in the city. The wholesale prices are calculated by the metric ton, with two types: 55 yuan and 54 yuan. As for various types of firewood and charcoal, there is sufficient stock, and there is no significant impact. The industry will sell at uniform prices and will not raise prices further. As it is summer, the use of fuel has decreased, so there is no fear of a fuel shortage.

### Gap in North Jiangxi Road Still Not Closed; Japanese Issue Permits; Population Obviously Greatly Reduced

According to Datong News Agency, although a week has passed since the Japanese side sealed off the eastern end of North Jiangxi Road, the shops, households, and alleys have not yet been closed. However, there are still a few Japanese soldiers on guard. Residents who enter and exit do not need permits. After several days of relocation by households or shops, the population has obviously decreased, resulting in streets full of "vacant house for rent" postings, but few people are interested. The Japanese side is still issuing temporary permits to those who remain in the area. From this, it can be inferred that it remains to be seen when the new obstacles will be removed.

### Staff of Miscellaneous Grain Exchange Request a Change in Gate Regulations; Petition the Chinese Ratepayers Association; Request the Issuance of Credentials for Entry and Exit

Since the French Concession police implemented emergency precautions, all iron gates of the Avenue Edward VII Miscellaneous Grain Exchange have been ordered by the authorities to open at 8:00 AM and close at 11:00 AM, then reopen at 1:30 PM, and close completely at 7:00 PM. The staff and families living within the exchange are concerned that if a fire or emergency occurs, they will be unable to escape due to these regulations. Therefore, they have petitioned the French police and the exchange authorities for a change in the regulations, but without success. Thus, at 10:00 AM yesterday, two representatives were sent to the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association with a written petition requesting intervention, or that the authorities issue credentials for entry and exit to protect lives. Secretary Wang Runsheng met with them and promised to consult with the acting chairman and handle the matter impartially.

### The Authorities are Consulting on Measures to Suppress Rice Prices Based on Reports; The Zhexi Grain Sales Organization is Not Yet Sound, and Various Counties are Intercommunicating to Maintain People's Food Supply

The bean and rice market, consisting of 105 firms, is seeing a recent scarcity of national rice sources, leading to public unease. Speculative rice merchants are taking advantage of the opportunity to become active, devising various schemes to enrich themselves. They frequent the market, engaging in private transactions, causing the black market to become increasingly rampant. People are restless and uneasy, filled with anxiety. Such occurrences are rare in history, resulting in a standstill in overall market transactions, a sluggish market situation, and noisy crowds. Although there is a bustling back-and-forth, everything is just empty talk. Formal transactions have completely disappeared.

Report Indicates the Actual Market Situation

The Public Concession's Bureau of Works and the French Concession's Board of Directors dispatched detectives to set up posts in the rice market, supervising daily and setting price limits for rice, which were strictly enforced. For a time, rice prices fell, but recently, due to hoarding merchants refusing to sell, the market supply has dried up, and black market transactions have proliferated. The order is becoming increasingly chaotic. In addition to closely monitoring black market transactions and rewarding those who report them, the authorities' supervisors have now reported the chaotic market situation to the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the two concessions to devise appropriate measures to suppress the market situation and crack down on black market activities. It is reported that the committee is very concerned about the market situation and has agreed on a major plan to stabilize the rice market and maintain the food supply for the entire city.

Retail Sales Face Difficult Circumstances

Since speculative merchants in the bean and rice market raised prices, members of the Rice Merchants Association have found it difficult to purchase the scarce rice supplies limited to 20 yuan and 16 yuan. Retail departments of rice shops are selling off remaining stock at the limited prices for good rice, but the supply is about to run out. If black market activities are not suppressed, there will be no goods available for sale. Yesterday, prices in the market continued to rise by one yuan or seven to eight jiao. Top-grade white japonica rice exceeded the 25-yuan mark.

Poor Distribution of Grain in Zhexi

The Zhexi Administrative Office previously received reports from various counties stating that panic was increasing daily, requesting prompt relief. The office promptly advanced funds and telegraphed the product sales office to actively find ways to transport and provide relief. According to the reply, the office has purchased a total of 9,818 dan and 4 dou of grain before and after, with 3,687 dan and 2 dou still in storage unsold. However, this grain relief has encountered various difficulties due to the failure of various parties to cooperate. For example, the sales organizations for grain in the war zone counties are mostly unsound, or even non-existent, so the rice transported by this office is not accepted by anyone. Counties with organizations lack capital and are unable to pay cash as required for receiving grain from this office, resulting in poor turnover. Furthermore, the local selling prices set by various counties do not match the market prices at the grain source locations, making it impossible to accept the rice when the price of incoming rice exceeds the local selling price. The original rice in the local area flows out to other places with higher prices. In terms of transportation, there is a shortage of tools and manpower, and the assistance from the county governments is minimal.

Instructing Various Counties to Improve Organizations

These various difficulties cannot be resolved. As a result, the purchased rice cannot be transported out, the transported rice cannot be sold, and the sold rice cannot be cashed out. The administrative office specially instructed various counties that in the future, each county should immediately improve its local rice sales organization, raise funds, and pay cash immediately for the grain purchased on their behalf by the transportation and sales office when it arrives in the county to facilitate turnover. At the same time, local rice prices must not be deliberately suppressed, and refusal to sell is prohibited. As for transportation, civil labor should be hired at any time to actively assist in transportation, so that a steady supply can be ensured. The supply of food rice in the interior is not severely low, but there are difficulties with operating a good plan.

### French Concession Police Sent Detectives to Search Hehe Lane, but Found Nothing

Yesterday morning at six o'clock, the French Police Department dispatched a large number of detectives in trucks to Hehe Lane at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Hua Long, surrounding both the north and south lanes and searching house by house. The search ended around eight o'clock, and it was reported that nothing was found.

### Two Hundred and Fifty Jewish Refugees Arrived and Were Settled in the "Jewish Quarter"

Two hundred and fifty Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria arrived in port on the Italian postal ship Victoria on the afternoon of the 7th at 4:00 PM. These refugees may be settled in the "Jewish Quarter" in the area of Ward Road and Pingliang Road. It is reported that by the end of this year, the number of Jewish refugees will exceed 10,000.

### European Mail Arrived in Shanghai, One Batch from Vancouver, One Batch from Italy

Yesterday, two batches of European mail arrived in Shanghai. One batch, from Vancouver, consisted of 400 bags and was transported by the Empress of Russia. The other batch, from Italy, had an unspecified number of bags and was transported by the Vesuvia.

### Severe Market Fluctuations: Foreign Exchange Rates Plummeted Again Yesterday, but it Had No Impact on the Overall Financial Structure; The Government Maintained Extraordinary Stability of the Legal Tender

Shanghai's financial market is subject to fluctuations due to the machinations of unscrupulous individuals who spread rumors for profit, as the government's authority does not extend there. However, this has no impact on China's wartime financial structure. In areas controlled by the government, foreign exchange rates for the legal tender are exceptionally stable. Imports of necessities are still supplied with foreign exchange as much as possible. The details are as follows:

Extraordinary Stability of Legal Tender Foreign Exchange

Since the government has made every effort to stabilize the currency system, the foreign exchange rate of the legal tender in all non-occupied areas under the direct control of the government has been exceptionally stable. The entire financial system remains stable. For the import of essential goods, one can apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for legal foreign exchange. Although it is necessary to pay a balancing fee for the difference between the legal exchange rate and the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, one can still obtain 70% of the required foreign exchange. For the export of major native products, one can receive the legal exchange rate from the foreign exchange settlement bank, along with the difference from the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee continues to equalize foreign exchange as much as possible in non-occupied Shanghai. The established legal prices of foreign exchange in various places remain unchanged.

Special Circumstances in Occupied Areas

The situation in occupied areas such as Shanghai is special. The government's authority does not extend there temporarily, resulting in the interception of customs revenue and expenditures by the Japanese. Japanese goods and luxury goods are imported from the occupied areas. Speculators are manipulating the black market for foreign exchange. The flight of capital from the concessions has caused the black market exchange rate in occupied Shanghai to plummet from 80% to 40%. In fact, the fall in the legal tender exchange rate in the occupied areas has no impact on China's wartime financial structure. The true value of the legal tender remains one shilling two and a half pence and thirty US dollars. The black market exchange rate in Shanghai is not maintained and is allowed to fluctuate naturally to avoid encouraging someone from extracting foreign exchange.

Preventing Escape and Encouraging Internal Migration

To prevent capital from escaping to occupied Shanghai, the interior is working hard to restrict remittances to Shanghai, causing the Shanghai exchange rate to rise in various places. For example, remittances to Shanghai from Chongqing and other places have risen to 1,400 yuan. Remittances are paid in Shanghai and limited to high amounts. However, to encourage the internal transfer of capital, remittances from Shanghai to the interior are exempt from remittance fees, and Shanghai is allowed to pay remittances, while the interior provides full cash. The Domestic Remittance Management Committee, established by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, handles this. It is reported that a large amount of capital is staying in Shanghai, and various banks and firms have a surplus of capital. They are now considering how to transfer the surplus capital internally.

Legal Tender Credit is Always Solid

China's legal tender policy was successful before the war, and its credit has become even more apparent during the war. As of the end of June this year, the cash reserve for legal tender was still above 44%. All inspections have been in line with the legal ratio. The government has never resorted to paper money policies, and legal tender credit has always been solid. To this day, it is still circulating as usual in the occupied areas. Although someone has repeatedly tried to use their "Lianquan" and "Huaquan" to expel the legal tender, as of now, even in areas under Japanese influence, the Lianquan and Huaquan lack value and are always below the legal tender. All payments are still mainly made in legal tender, and people are still happy to hoard legal tender.

The Financial Market is Fluctuating Severely

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the financial market yesterday that the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have denied the incident of ordering 100 million legal tender banknotes from London via telegram. However, the Shanghai financial market remains chaotic due to the manipulation of speculators. Yesterday, HSBC's listed exchange rates fell again, with the British exchange rate down 3.75 pence and the US exchange rate down 7.3125 yuan. As a result, the official transaction prices in the black market broke through the 4-pence mark for the British exchange rate and the 8-yuan mark for the US exchange rate. Speculators continue to aggressively seize opportunities, and the black market price of gold has risen sharply again, closing at 4,050 yuan in the morning and 4,080 yuan in the afternoon. Unified securities fell by 1.3 yuan for type A, and 0.9 yuan for types B, C, D, and E. Remittance discount rose to 210 yuan again.

### Enthusiastic Investment in Western China Development; The Development Company Raised Funds, Exceeding the Original Amount by One Times

The Western China Development Company, recently launched by the industrial sector, has raised funds in Shanghai, exceeding the original amount by one times. Various sectors in Chongqing and other provinces in the southwest have also made large investments. The designated development areas include Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Gansu, Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces. It is reported that the central government will soon promote this development work to facilitate its full realization.

### The Bureau of Works' Publication of Official Gazette Caused Criticism from Western Newspapers; This Year's Publication is Still Issued by the North China Daily News, and Western Newspapers Jointly Filed a Strong Protest

The Continental Daily News reported that the Public Concession's Bureau of Works recently decided to continue its current arrangement to have the North China Daily News publish the Bureau of Works' official gazette for the 31st consecutive year. The managers of major local newspapers criticized this yesterday (the 7th), and there was a strong reaction. They unanimously believe that the Bureau of Works' arbitrary decision has no legal or moral basis, nor any economic reason.

In Terms of Law

Giving any one newspaper an exclusive priority for matters related to all taxpayers is contrary to the Public Concession's charter. In terms of morality, it shows unfair discrimination against foreign nationals and violates the moral principle of acting fairly. In terms of economics, it uses taxpayer funds without allowing them to see the Bureau of Works' public tender, so the Bureau of Works

Can Contract With The Lowest Price

The Ta Lu Pao, Shanghai Times, Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, Deutsche Shanghai Zeitung, Russian Slovo, and Japanese Continental News have recently submitted a strongly worded joint appeal to the Bureau of Works, objecting to the long-term discriminatory treatment. They stated that the Bureau of Works' action is extremely unfair and warrants the most careful consideration so that the principle of fair public administration can be restored. The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury also said that a subcommittee of the Bureau of Works' Economic Committee recently issued a report

Supporting Continued Publication

By the North China Daily News. Six foreign daily newspapers here have filed a strong protest. Because the Bureau of Works is on summer vacation, it has not yet formally responded. The protest was signed by six newspapers, including the Shanghai Times, and submitted to Mr. Phillips, the Secretary-General of the Bureau of Works, on Saturday. Mr. Phillips said yesterday (the 7th) that he was aware of the appeal and would ask the Bureau of Works to pay attention to it after the summer

Vacation Ends

This morning (the 8th), Mr. Phillips said again that the Bureau of Works can only convene a meeting during the summer vacation in the event of special and urgent events. According to the subcommittee's report to the Bureau of Works, urging the continuation of the practice of the North China Daily News publishing the official gazette, the cost is still considered fair. If the equipment is purchased and printed in the prison on Ward Road, it will cost 100,000 yuan.

### Special Import Permits for Necessary Supplies; The Ministry of Finance Has Promulgated Eight Measures, and Has Also Promulgated Measures for Export Foreign Exchange Settlement

After the Ministry of Finance promulgated measures prohibiting the import of goods during extraordinary times, it ordered the Director-General of Customs to forward the order to various customs offices to prohibit the import of goods under 18 groups and 230 tax tariff numbers. It is estimated that after the implementation of the above measures, based on the import amount in the 27th year, 23 million yuan in national currency can be saved, equivalent to US$68 million and £13 million. However, because the wartime requirements of

National Defense Supplies

Materials for industry, transportation, etc., still rely heavily on imports, the ministry order with the number "渝資字第八六二號" was specially issued to promulgate eight measures for obtaining import permits for goods prohibited from import during extraordinary times to meet actual needs. If it is for the purpose of adjusting market prices in the rear and supplying special essential uses, and it is approved by a government agency, an

Import Permit Shall Be Issued

After review and approval by the ministry in accordance with the measures. At the same time, to allow export goods to be freely transported and sold, fifteen measures for foreign exchange settlement reporting of export goods were promulgated, attached with a detailed list of restricted goods for export reporting and transshipment, and a table of designated restricted areas for reporting and transshipment of restricted goods. In addition to detailed regulations for foreign exchange settlement reporting, Article 8 also stipulates that merchants

Settle Exchange Amounts

With the national bank, they may obtain from the bank an amount equivalent to the difference between the legal price and the bank's listed exchange rate. All the full texts of the above two measures and attachments will be published in the Industrial and Commercial Information column so that Shanghai merchants can be fully informed.

### Industrial Common Sense and Safety Training Class; Correcting Misunderstandings and Instilling Common Sense; Training is Free for All Students

### Collecting Gold and Silver Nationwide to Replenish Legal Tender Foreign Exchange Reserves; All are Concentrated in Hong Kong and Then Shipped to the UK and the US; Various Provinces are Working Hard to Collect in Accordance with Ministry Orders

Since the Ministry of Finance collected gold and silver nationwide and concentrated it in Hong Kong for shipment to the UK, the US and other countries to replenish the foreign exchange reserves of the legal tender, the US has agreed to purchase a huge amount of silver from China. Therefore, various provinces and cities have received Ministry orders to continue working hard to collect it. The amount of gold and silver exported after the war is recorded as follows:

Silver

From September to December of the 26th year, 336,119,039 yuan was exported. In the entire 27th year, 80,330,037 yuan was exported. In the first half of the 28th year, 1,422,081 yuan was exported.

Gold

From September to December of the 26th year, 1,802,640 gold was exported. In the entire 27th year, 670,138 gold was exported. In the first half of the 28th year, 1,280,185 gold was exported.

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Issues Certificates for Factory and Shop Employees; Salary Books and Receipts Must Be Examined

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has stipulated the following measures for issuing service certificates for employees of factories and shops in the city: (1) Employees of factories and shops in the city who apply to the Chamber for a service certificate must comply with these measures. (2) Employees who apply for a certificate must provide their name, age, native place, address of their hometown, the name of the factory or shop where they work, and its detailed address (the exact location must be stated, such as a certain lane and number in Shanghai), along with two 2.5-inch half-length photos and salary books and receipts from the factory or shop for each year.

(5) The Chamber only handles this certificate for members of the Chamber. (6) These measures may be amended by the Chamber at any time if there are any outstanding issues.

### The Puppet Organization in Nanshi Promotes the Baojia System; Implementation of Drafting Strong Men; Residents are Anxious

The puppet Nanshi District Office at No. 50 Yisu Lane, Penglai Road, Nanshi, in order to ingratiate itself with its masters and plunder the people, invented the Baojia system in September last year, issued Good Citizen Certificates, and set up a Baojia Office at No. 29 Wanzhu Street in the refugee area, specializing in this matter. Unexpectedly, at the same time, Yu Ying, the puppet police chief, announced the dismantling, ordering citizens to obtain citizen certificates from the nearest sub-bureau. For a time, the masses felt at a loss.

Unable to Bear the Noise

Moreover, those who had already obtained Good Citizen Certificates were being attacked and beaten by Japanese soldiers who tore up their certificates when entering and leaving the docks. This caused an uproar. Soon, the Baojia Office collapsed invisibly. Unexpectedly, recently, the puppet Nanshi District Office has restarted the Baojia system, setting up a registration office at No. 6 Chengd坊, Minli Street, outside the Great South Gate. Zhu Huimin, the chief of the second section of the puppet office, concurrently serves as the head of the Baojia section. The registration of Baojia households has been implemented house by house in various districts since last month. The method is to combine several surnames and families living in one house, or one surname,

With a Larger Population

Those who live alone in a house, that is, one house is taken as a unit, and a household head is selected. One Jia head is selected for every ten households, one Bao head is selected for every ten Jia, and one District head is selected for every ten Bao. Nanshi is divided into several districts, which are uniformly managed by the Baojia section. Each household unit must fill out a printed form in detail, including the name of the household head, family members, residents or employees, age, gender, native place, occupation, address, number of years of residence, religion, relationship between family members and the household head, and the relationship between residents or employees and the household head.

Joint and Several Guarantees

After being filled out, it is reviewed and approved, and then a household registration certificate is issued. Each person is given a certificate to carry with them for passage. At the same time, the puppet Nanshi Police Sub-Bureau has been ordered to stop issuing citizen certificates and household registration certificates. When the Baojia system is completed, these certificates will be invalidated. However, the puppet organization's move is actually to re-investigate the household registration and then implement the drafting of strong men for training, using pacification as a pretext for driving them. Therefore, the residents of Nanshi are all uneasy.

### The Bureau of Works' Band's Music Program is Temporarily Suspended

The Bureau of Works' Band's concert programs originally scheduled for this Wednesday (the 9th) to Sunday (the 13th) have now been canceled.

### Pawning and Selling Opium; Detectives Received a Tip and Solved the Case by Disguising Themselves as Buyers

The Hengfeng Pawnshop at No. 134 Route des Soeurs, is opened by Chen Awu (also known as Desheng) from Chaozhou. In addition to operating the pawnshop business, Chen secretly sells opium. In December last year, the Public Concession Police received a report and went to search, but Chen was well-informed and had already hidden the opium elsewhere, so the detectives were unable to find any incriminating evidence and could not prosecute him. Since then, Chen has

Dared to Act Recklessly

And continued his business. Unexpectedly, recently, Hua Detective Ye Yuxi of the Narcotics Department found out about it and disguised himself as a customer to contact Chen for the purchase of opium. At that time, it was stated that 180 yuan in legal tender would buy 16 liang of opium. The money was to be paid first, and the goods would be delivered later. Detective Ye gave the 180 yuan in legal tender with a secret mark. Then, Chen Zhongshi, a woman from Chaozhou, who is Chen Awu's sister-in-law, delivered the opium to the intersection of Dagu Road and Chongqing Road. The detectives, Li Shugui and Liu Zhaonian,

Arrested Chen

Then Chen led them to the Hengfeng Pawnshop, and they found three large pieces of opium, weighing 164 liang, an opium lamp, an opium pipe, and a pair of scissors with opium stains in various rooms upstairs. They also found 624 yuan in foreign currency. Then, they found the 180 yuan in legal tender with a secret mark in a charcoal basket on the sun deck. Chen Awu, the principal offender, was also taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. After a while, Lin Guoying, a 21-year-old Chaozhou native,

Who Had Applied to the Police Station

Claimed that the 600-700 yuan in currency belonged to him and had been confiscated by the police. He requested its return. The police suspected that Lin was suspicious and detained him as well. This morning, Chen Zhongshi, Chen Awu, and Lin Guoying were sent to the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. After the detectives stated everything, the judge, Lun, ordered the three defendants to be detained separately and ordered a second hearing in seven days.

### The Wind of Embezzlement is Rampant; The Results are All Sent to Gambling Dens

Chu Hongliang (23 years old), a native of Ningbo, had been working as a sales representative at the Xiang Sheng Sock Factory at No. 221 North Zhejiang Road for six months. He was considered quite reliable. Unexpectedly, between April and the 5th of this month, he used a fake seal to collect 562 yuan in private from seven customers, including Jin Xing, Mao Sheng, and Shun Long. He did not return to the factory and spent the money. Until noon the day before yesterday, Hua Police No. 1166 from the Huishi Police Station arrested him on North Zhejiang Road and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, the police lawyer, elaborated on the case and requested an extension for investigation. When questioned, the suspect's confession was vague. (It is reported that the embezzled money was lost in gambling dens such as the Rong Sheng Company in Caojiadu. The largest amount lost in those gambling dens was 10,500 yuan by Qiu Ru, a native of Ningbo, who was recently sentenced to six years in prison.) Judge Jiang Lun ordered him to remain in custody and set another date for verification.

### Case of Robbery of a Detective's Gun; A Runner of an Egg Shop is Detained for Investigation

A man named Lu Axiang was riding a bicycle to the Fu Tai Egg Shop at No. 285 Ningxing Street at around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to buy eggs. Because he had an outstanding debt, the egg shop detained his bicycle. The two sides argued and twisted each other to the French Concession Police Station, where they were each fined one yuan and released. Because the egg shop still did not allow Lu Axiang to take the bicycle, Lu filed a report to the police station. Therefore, the police station ordered Detective Wu Wengang to go to the Fu Tai Egg Shop to notify them that debts could not be collected by detaining property. Ni Baosheng (37 years old), a runner from Jiangwan, and others at the egg shop believed that Lu Axiang was leading gangsters to cause trouble, so another argument broke out, and a martial arts drama ensued. As a result, the gun carried by Detective Wu Wengang was also robbed by Ni Baosheng and others. The French Concession Police received the report and ordered Inspector Li Xianyang, Detective Shen Jinshu, Detective Zhang Mucheng, Detective Zhang Hongkui, and many French detectives to rush to the scene and arrest Ni Baosheng, Tang Amao, Yang Sanlang, Qiu Runan, Yang Shangzhen, and the owner of the egg shop, Tong Longhua. They also found Detective Wu Wengang's robbed gun in the egg shop. The police believed that Ni Baosheng and others had obstructed official duties and needed to be investigated in detail. Therefore, yesterday, the six arrested were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, requesting detention for investigation. Judge Qiu Huanxing took the stand to interrogate them. The defendants did not admit to obstructing official duties. The court verified the statements and ordered Ni Baosheng to be detained. Tong Longhua, Tang Amao, and others were each released on bail of 300 yuan. A second hearing was scheduled for the 18th of this month.

### Theft of Copper Wire: Two Receiving Agencies Busted

The Hong Tai Yuan copper and tin shop at 314 Yaozhu Jiao Road, opened by Yin Jiayuan from Nanjing, had a thriving business and substantial capital. After August 13th, Yin changed his business policy, specializing in buying stolen copper, iron, and copper wire from thieves operating in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas at low prices, melting it down, and selling it to a certain party. As a result, he made considerable profits over the past two years. Recently, on August 1st, the Legal Affairs Office of the French Police received a tip-off and arrested a key suspect who specialized in stealing copper wire. The suspect confessed that the stolen wire over the past two years had all been sold to Yin Jiayuan and Tongxinghao at 276 Beijing Road. Based on the confession, the police dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives on August 8th, successively arresting Yin Jiayuan's wife, Yin Zhou (26 years old, from Nanjing), Sun Peilin (24 years old, from Nanjing), apprentice Wang Xiangzhi (18 years old, from Nanjing), Zhou Mingquan (19 years old, from Danyang), Xiao Rongfu (18 years old, from Zhenjiang), Zhang Dequan (26 years old, from Nanjing), and Pan Xianwen (26 years old, from Nanjing) from 276 Beijing Road, totaling seven people. Over 500 catties of copper wire and other stolen goods were confiscated. The main suspect, Yin Jiayuan, fled upon hearing the news. All the arrested persons and stolen goods were taken to the police station and transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer presented the case, stating that the defendants were arrested for theft and receiving stolen goods. The investigation was not yet complete, and a request for an extension was made. After the investigating detective Wu Wengang reported the progress of the case, Judge Huang Yan reviewed the documents and ordered a postponement to the morning of August 17th. The defendants were detained.

### Robbery of Banknotes on the Road: Suspect Handed Over to Court Yesterday

On the morning of the 8th, at 11:00 AM, Song Acai, a clerk from the Zhongfu Bank at 104 Renji Road, was on his way to the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road to withdraw 3,000 yuan in legal tender. While Song was counting the money inside the post office, two burly men were standing nearby. When Song finished counting and wrapped the money in paper to carry it out, the two men followed him. When he reached the intersection of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road, the men seized the opportunity and snatched the package of banknotes, fleeing the scene. Song chased and shouted, and with the help of a patrolman, a Shandong man named Chen Desheng was apprehended, and the stolen money was recovered on the spot. The other thief escaped. According to the apprehended thief's confession at the police station, his accomplice's name was Sun Degui. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Chen, along with the stolen goods, to the First Special District Local Court for trial. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, explained the situation and requested a postponement to investigate the remaining accomplices. Judge Feng then questioned Chen, but Chen was evasive. He hired two lawyers, Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, for his defense. The court stated that the case still required investigation and ordered Chen to be detained for further questioning at a later date.

### Chauffeur Incites a Crowd to Commit Assault: Six Accomplices Arrested

Zhang Xiaomao, a chauffeur residing at No. 1 Yuan Shang Li, Dong Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession, a three-story building currently used as the residence of the French Municipal Council's compradore Hu, had a long-standing feud with He Jingqing, who resided on the second floor and worked as an accountant at the Lao Zheng He restaurant on Yunnan Road. On the afternoon of the 5th, Zhang gathered more than ten chauffeurs (both men and women), each carrying clubs, and stormed into He's room, wantonly destroying property and severely injuring He Jingqing, Li Binghan, Xie Dejun, and others. By the time the patrolling police arrived, the assailants had already scattered and fled. The injured were taken to the police station and then transferred to the hospital for treatment. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the French police dispatched Chinese and French detectives to No. 1 Yuan Shang Li and Hu's residence's garage to arrest the suspects. However, the main culprit, Zhang Xiaomao, had already gone into hiding. Only five male and one female accomplice (the female being the wife of another chauffeur from Hu's residence) were apprehended and taken to the police station, awaiting the arrest of the main culprit for further investigation.

### Lawsuit Involving Mother and Son at Jingli Elementary School Implicates the School

Deliberately Claiming a Biological Son as Adopted

Zhang Fuhua (26 years old), the principal of Jingli Elementary School at Lane 60, Santai Road in this city, was recently sued by his mother, Zhang Ni (56 years old), in the Civil Court of the First Special District, demanding that he be ordered to pay for her support. It is understood that the case will be heard again at 10:00 AM today in the First Civil Court of the First Special Court. Both parties will have a debate. The details are quite complicated. The defendant, Zhang Fuhua, is not an adopted son. It is found that the plaintiff has three daughters and one son, who is the defendant. The eldest daughters are the defendant's sisters. The married daughter is married, and the eldest daughter, who is in her thirties, is still unmarried and lives with the plaintiff in the school. They often discuss matters and stir up the plaintiff, alienating the mother and son, leading to this unfortunate lawsuit. Deliberately claiming the defendant as an adopted son to shake his position as principal. Therefore, there is also another case where lawyer Shen Ronghua sued the defendant in the name of the principal for occupying school property and refusing to hand it over. In reality, the defendant has the dual qualifications of principal and school owner, and no one else has the right to compete for the position of principal. Now, claiming him as an adopted son is intended to slander his position as principal. Furthermore, it is found that the school had debts of several thousand taels of silver before the war, all of which were managed by the defendant after he took office. He has been working hard to run the school until now, and the school's affairs have only just started to develop. However, it is only enough to maintain the school. As for the plaintiff, being his own mother, how could he not take care of her? However, due to financial reasons, he only gives her 25 yuan per month, but he has never stopped. Now, she suddenly wants to double it to 50 yuan, which the defendant cannot afford. As for the plaintiff's claims that the defendant lives an extremely extravagant life, buying chauffeured cars and going to dance halls, these are completely false and can be verified from all sides. Therefore, the court is conducting a detailed investigation of the case outside of the court hearing.

### Refugee Arrested for Theft

Zhang Fugen (30 years old), a local resident, lived in the Gaochang Temple area. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, he sought refuge in the concession, living in a refugee camp with his parents, wife, and children for nearly two years. At 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, Zhang Fugen saw a Ningbo woman named Wang Shao at the corner of Hede Road and Changping Road. She was wearing luxurious clothes, had glasses on her nose, and was carrying a leather bag. Zhang suddenly had malicious intent and snatched her bag from behind, attempting to escape.

### Arson Case on Kaizi'er Road Resulting in Multiple Deaths: Arsonist Handed Over to Court Yesterday, Granted Bail of 4,000 Yuan Pending Trial

No. 6 Renchang Lane, 214 Kaizi'er Road, is a three-story building. The second landlord, Zhang Bingsheng (40 years old, from Huzhou), lives on the ground floor and runs the Happy Forest Film Company, storing many old films in the house. He has fire insurance worth 8,000 yuan. The upper floor is rented to lawyer Zhang Baotang from Fengxian and others. At 4:15 PM on the 5th of this month, the old films stored by Zhang Bingsheng suddenly caught fire. Because the films were made of materials containing rosin and other substances, they were easily flammable. Therefore, the fire spread rapidly and became uncontrollable. Only a tenant surnamed Li from the east side room on the upper floor and the second landlord's entire family escaped. Zhang Baotang's wife, Zhu Surong, daughter, dog, nanny Li Cuiying, and another maid, along with Zhang Chuqing's wife Wang, daughter Xiu'e, Xiao Mao, and nephew Wang Zhongfu, tenants from the west side room on the upper floor, a total of eight people, all died in the fire. The house was completely destroyed, and the fire spread to the landlord's residence at No. 7. Fortunately, the fire brigade was able to extinguish the fire, and the landlord's losses were relatively light. After the incident, the eight burned corpses were examined by the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, who allowed their families to prepare coffins and claim them. The arsonist, Zhang Bingsheng, turned himself in to the French Concession Police, requesting lenient treatment. The French police believed that Zhang Bingsheng had committed crimes of endangering public safety and manslaughter, so yesterday, they escorted Zhang to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, requesting detention for investigation. Judge Miao Qingbang presided over the hearing. The defendant, Zhang Bingsheng, claimed that on the day of the incident, he had left the house for business. When he heard that there was a fire at home, he could not return, so he turned himself in to the police station and requested leniency. The court reviewed the documents and ordered the defendant to pay a deposit of 4,000 yuan to the shop as bail and postponed the hearing to the 14th of this month.

Without Prevention Also, the French-language "Le Journal de Shanghai" reported on the 8th, according to information obtained by this newspaper (the French-language "Le Journal de Shanghai" referring to itself), regarding the Kaizi'er Road fire that resulted in eight deaths, it is said that the Happy Forest Film Depot did not have a license. The municipal authorities should have ordered the implementation of preventive measures to prevent the fire that occurred on the previous Saturday.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Volatile and Unstable; Frequent Settlements Created New Low Prices; Chongqing Denies Rumors, Market Slightly Recovered; Japanese Merchants Continued Buying, Resulting in Continued Tightness

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the HSBC official exchange rate sharply decrease by .25 for British gold and .4375 for US dollars, both breaking the lowest prices of .40 and 7.75 from the 21st of last month, reaching unprecedented new lows of 3.75 for British gold and 7.3125 for US dollars. Other currencies also suffered declines. The informal market for British and US currencies was initially soft due to frequent settlements by foreign firms. After 9:30 AM, news suddenly broke that Chongqing had denied rumors of entrusting foreign countries to print 100 million new banknotes, which calmed sentiment slightly. Speculators briefly entered the market, causing the market to ease slightly. Bank buying rates had recovered to 3.9375 for British gold and 7.6875 for US dollars. (After 11:00 AM, Japanese banks suddenly started aggressively buying, and Hong Kong speculators also wired in purchases, tightening the market again. Unprecedentedly tight prices of 3.78125 for British gold and 7.4375 for US dollars briefly appeared. However, British gold was quoted as high as 3.78125, and US dollars were quoted as high as 7.375, but there were only quotes without actual transactions. Later, as the Japanese bank's buying subsided and Hong Kong's buying also stopped, and cotton yarn speculators entered the market, the situation gradually stabilized. As a result, British currency slightly tightened by .03125, and US currency slightly decreased by .0625. Although Chinese merchants absorbed some of the current month's futures, foreign firms were very keen to sell, ultimately causing a slight short squeeze. September futures suddenly started trading, and trading was brisk throughout the day.

HSBC Official Exchange Rates Decreased

Early in the morning, London's major exchange rates, gold prices, and British exchange rates were closed for holidays. New York's silver prices remained unchanged, and exchange rates for US dollars against British pounds and French francs were flat. The official exchange rates of the Central Bank remained unchanged. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3.90625 for British gold and 7.625 for US dollars, with no changes from the previous closing. After opening, the market softened due to frequent settlements by foreign firms and a lack of interest from foreign sellers. Foreign firms settled spot transactions with HSBC and other foreign banks at 3.875 and 3.8125 for British gold and 7.5 and 7.4375 for US dollars. When the HSBC official exchange rates were announced, British gold decreased by .25 and US dollars decreased by .4375. Other currencies also decreased across the board. The announcement that the silver balance tax would remain exempt had no impact. Subsequently, news suddenly came from Chongqing denying that the Ministry of Finance had entrusted British printers to print new banknotes. As a result, speculators began to sell, and other banks also started selling, causing the situation to ease immediately. Speculators sold spot British gold to Yuli and other foreign firms at 3.875 and 3.90625, and then sold spot US dollars to Netherlands and other foreign firms at 7.5625 and 7.625. At that time, foreign bank buying rates had recovered to 3.9375 for British gold and 7.6875 for US dollars. At around 11:00 AM, Western merchant Sassoon bought September British gold from foreign firms at 3.375. Soon after, Japanese banks suddenly began aggressively buying, and foreign Hong Kong wires also came in to settle, and foreign sellers became less interested, causing the market to tighten again. Japanese banks and Hong Kong wires, along with speculators, successively settled spot British gold from foreign firms, tightening from 3.875 to 3.78125. At the same time, US dollars also softened to 7.375. Near noon, the buying subsided slightly, and the situation turned stable. The bank's spot selling prices at noon were 3.84375 for British gold and 7.46875 for US dollars, tightening by .0625 and softening by .15625 compared to the morning opening.

The Current Month Saw a Short Squeeze

Although Japanese banks continued to buy aggressively in the afternoon, the situation remained stable due to the sudden entry of Chinese cotton yarn speculators and continued interest from foreign sellers, as well as some selling from Hong Kong wires. Japanese banks first settled spot British gold with Datong at 3.84375, and then foreign firms also settled spot British gold with HSBC at 3.84375. Later, HSBC resold spot British gold to cotton yarn speculators and Hong Kong wires at 3.875. After that, a certain bank sold current month US dollars to speculators at 7.3125. Soon after, Yuli also sold current month US dollars to speculators at 7.375. The bank's spot selling prices at the evening closing were 3.875 for British gold and 7.5625 for US dollars, and 3.78125 for current month British gold and 7.375 for US dollars. As a result, spot British currency tightened by .03125, and US currency softened by .0625 compared to the previous day. Current month British currency squeezed long by .03125, and US currency also squeezed long by .0625.

### Authorities Deny Printing New Banknotes; Gold Prices Rose and Then Retreated; Peak Reached 4,130 Yuan

Yesterday's cash sycee market was still chaotic. Initially, the lingering effects of the previous day persisted, and strong buying continued, with large buyers rushing in. As speculative long positions exacerbated the situation, the opening price at 9:30 AM broke the previous peak of 4,100 yuan from the morning of the 21st of last month, reaching an unprecedented record of 4,130 yuan. Later, Reuters in Chongqing denied the Reuters London dispatch from the previous day that the Ministry of Finance had entrusted British printers to print 100 million yuan in new banknotes. As a result, foreign exchange tightened, causing a selling frenzy, with long positions competing to exit the market. The market suddenly reversed, plunging to a low of 3,970 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, foreign exchange tightened again after aggressive buying by Japanese banks and Hong Kong interests. Therefore, buyers returned to the market, pushing the price back up to 4,100 yuan. At noon, foreign exchange stabilized, causing the noon closing price to fall back to 4,050 yuan. In the afternoon, as foreign exchange became more stable and many outside speculators were eager to exit their long positions, the market price retreated again to 4,000 yuan. The market closed at 4,008 yuan, continuing to increase by 48 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was extremely brisk, with 1,500 to 1,600 taels changing hands. Silver jewelry also fluctuated unpredictably, briefly reaching an unprecedented high of 415 yuan twice. Ultimately, it increased by 5 yuan. Customs gold and pure Chinese gold remained unchanged, due to the London market being closed for pure British gold.

Sycee Only Increased by 48 Yuan

From the initial opening of each bar (ten taels) in the morning, sentiment was strong, and buying became even more intense as foreign exchange continued to soften. At 9:30 AM, the opening price broke the peak of 4,100 yuan from the morning of the 21st of last month, increasing by 170 yuan compared to the previous closing. Money exchangers conducted transactions for 20 taels at a price of 4,130 yuan, an unprecedented new record. Suddenly, news came from Chongqing denying the reports from the previous few days that the Ministry of Finance had entrusted British printers to print new banknotes. At the same time, foreign exchange tightened, causing the market to weaken. A certain silver firm was eager to sell, plunging the price by 160 yuan. Jewelry stores conducted transactions for 30 taels at a price of 3,970 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop and money exchangers returned to absorb the supply, and the buying frenzy resumed. The price soon soared by 75 yuan. Money exchangers bought ten taels from jewelry stores at a price of 4,045 yuan. After that, a certain silver firm and a certain jewelry store (acting on behalf of a wealthy individual) continued to sell, causing the price to break back into the 4,000 yuan range. A certain silver firm sold 20 taels to a securities firm at a price of 3,990 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, the foreign exchange market tightened again, which stimulated buying again. Securities firms and money exchangers aggressively absorbed more than one hundred taels, causing the price to soar by 110 yuan. Money exchangers bought 30 taels from a certain gold shop at a price of 4,100 yuan. Near noon, news came that foreign exchange had stopped tightening and was slightly returning, and the price also declined accordingly, falling back by 50 yuan. Money exchangers sold ten taels to a gold shop at a price of 4,050 yuan, making it the noon closing price. The market opened 5 yuan lower in the afternoon. Gold shops sold 20 taels to securities firms at a price of 4,045 yuan. At that time, money exchangers aggressively absorbed several dozen taels, raising the price by 20 yuan. Money exchangers bought 30 taels from gold shops at a price of 4,065 yuan. After that, a certain gold shop, acting on behalf of speculative long positions, exited the market, and foreign exchange strengthened, plunging the price by 65 yuan. Gold shops sold 20 taels to a certain silver firm at a price of 4,000 yuan. After that, money exchangers returned to absorb slightly, returning the price by 20 yuan. Money exchangers bought 20 taels from jewelry stores at a price of 4,020 yuan. Later, jewelry stores continued to sell, and the price retreated slightly again. Jewelry stores sold 20 taels to money exchangers at a price of 4,008 yuan, making it the evening closing price. As a result, the price continued to increase by 48 yuan compared to the previous day. It has now increased for four consecutive days, totaling 408 yuan. The daily price range was 160 yuan. The selling price of cash gold from the local brand name was 10 yuan higher compared to sycee. The current standard gold price was 50 yuan lower than the official gold price. It is said that there was little trading in futures.

Jewelry Reached 415 Yuan

At 11:00 AM, it increased again by 5 yuan. At that time, Datong was still quoting 415 yuan, an unprecedented new peak. At 12:10 PM, it fell back slightly by 5 yuan. At 3:45 PM in the afternoon, it fell back by 5 yuan again. As a result, it increased by 5 yuan, with Datong revising its quote to 405 yuan and Xintong revising its quote to 403 yuan. The buying price was reduced by around 20 yuan.

### Rediscounting Reached 200 Yuan; Call Loan Rate Returned to .02

Yesterday's exchange bill rediscount rate rose to 200 yuan and beyond. The rate initially rose to 200 yuan per thousand, then continued to rise to 215 yuan. Near noon, it suddenly retreated slightly to 210 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell even lower to 205 yuan, then continued to rise to 210 yuan, increasing by 15 yuan compared to the previous day. The Money Trade Association's call loan rate has decreased by .02, quoted at .18.

### Foreign Currencies Increased Sharply; US Dollar Bills Decreased Alone

Yesterday, foreign currencies saw very strong increases due to tighter foreign exchange and a stronger sycee market. British and US gold pounds were in high demand, and British gold bills were in strong demand, increasing at a brisk pace. US dollar bills were initially quite strong, but the market softened after banks increased supply. The Hong Kong dollar and French franc markets were firm. Singapore dollar and Dutch guilder were in high demand and followed the upward trend. The Canadian dollar market was slightly affected by the weakness of the US dollar bill market, showing a slight decline. The Japanese gold bill market was not very active, and the market was stable, with a rate of 1.09. Demand for Korean bills increased, and they trended slightly higher, with an evening rate of .905. Trading was not brisk at the association. Yongfeng sold and Taijin bought 20 British gold pounds. Qintai sold and Sentai bought 300 US dollar bills, and Xiangfeng sold and Taijin bought 300 US dollar bills. Rentai sold and Jindai bought 600 Hong Kong dollars. Yesterday's market prices saw increases of 1 yuan for British and US gold pounds and Australian gold bills, 1.2 yuan for British gold bills, a decrease of .17 yuan for US dollar bills, an increase of .15 yuan for Hong Kong dollars, an increase of .005 yuan for French francs, an increase of .3 yuan for Singapore dollars, an increase of .4 yuan for Dutch guilders, an increase of .25 yuan for rupee, a decrease of .1 yuan for Canadian dollars, and an increase of .2 yuan for German gold bills. Other currencies did not change.

### Securities: Unified Class A Shares Plunge

Yesterday's off-market trading of securities continued to decline. The discrepancy between this trend and reality is entirely caused by the major players on the trading floor. There are rumors that groups borrowing stocks to short sell are small and weak, so they resort to inverting black and white, spare no effort to spread negative publicity, the long side is floating and unrealistic, and those who use their ears instead of their eyes are also drawn into the vortex, in order to achieve their profit goals. Generally, buying in at the general price on the trading floor is small, while the groups create false transactions among themselves, making the market price not small from small. Investors are naturally unmoved by this kind of pathological market, but speculators inevitably fall into the dice game. However, it is a fact that there is some mortgage settlement in the market. Yesterday, the market fell as soon as it opened. Speculators took the opportunity to squeeze, and Class C shares broke through 40 yuan. No. 49, Quan Sheng, Lianhe, Hongkang, etc., all sold off. Dingkang, Lemao, Zhenkang, Lianyizhong, and No. 35 all bought in. Class C shares alone had the strongest fluctuations. However, the closing price was higher than the opening price, and most short sellers covered their positions. Large short positions are all watching. Trading was quite lively, and the market price fell by another 9 jiao to 1 yuan 3 jiao. The transaction volume was more than 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below. (Foreign debts and British Far East stocks are closed for holidays.)

Stock trading: 50 shares of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of 36 yuan 1 jiao.

Yesterday's stock market in the Public Industry Exchange was greatly affected by the continued tightening of foreign exchange, and it was very active. Rubber stock trading was the most active. After the market opened in the morning, prices rose steadily, and the prices of many stocks reached new highs. Later, as those who made profits came out, prices slightly declined, but the market sentiment was still firm at the close.

There are many stocks on the market that have not been taken into account, that is, those that do not move with this rising trend, such as the Lipton shares, the Siemens Cloth shares, and the Kalantan shares, while the Chen shares have fallen back to 5 jiao 5 fen. Each company has good internal qualities, but has not been noticed for the time being. This is the only opportunity for investors to buy stocks with funds and hold them for a long time.

Among industrial stocks, Jardine Matheson shares were slightly lower, but Kailan Mining shares rose with the rise in foreign exchange. There was little change in other stocks, and the bond market was weak.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculation is Hot, Cotton Yarn Jumps Another 20 Yuan

The rising trend in the yarn market is very strong, with new highs emerging one after another, and there is a tendency to borrow again and again. Speculative buying is becoming more and more rampant, and there is an image that there is no yarn to buy, which shows the tension of the situation. As for the shouts of the mobile brokers in the market, they are already violent and chaotic. Someone asks for 30 yuan over there, and someone offers 40 yuan over here, and someone drags it away. This kind of scene cannot be described in words. In short, people are panic-stricken to the extreme. Looking at the actual situation, the market is indeed bullish, but such enthusiasm is inevitably beyond the norm, and a reversal should not be prevented. The price of two strands of gold coins is 720 yuan.

The current yarn market is tight and soaring. Because the exchange rate was changed and shrunk the day before, buyers are like springs. The opening price of 20 strands of double horse wharf orders is 608 yuan. After a while, the buying sound was loud and the market rose, one after another, and one addition was as high as 5 yuan to 10 yuan. The operators in the market are like hairpins. In a moment, the price of 20 strands of double horse foreign wharf goods rose from the opening price of 630 yuan to 620 yuan and 5 yuan. After the close, it continued to rise. However, in the afternoon, it was heard that the British exchange rate had slightly eased. The transaction volume for half a day was 1,675 bales, and the transaction volume in the afternoon of the previous day was 530 bales. The market price of 20 strands of double horses rose by 35 yuan, the special gold coins rose by 20 yuan, the five-son lion rose by 20 yuan, and 10 strands of coarse yarn also rose by 20 yuan. Shenxin No. 2 Factory opened 400 bales of 20 strands of fairy, at a price of 590 yuan. The current store orders, today there are 195 bales of cotton yarn to Tianjin, 21 pieces to Yantai, 30 pieces to Xiamen, 60 pieces to Beihai, and 310 pieces to Guangzhou Bay.

The amount purchased by each gang is as follows:

Hong Kong 465, Daily Trading 875

Tianjin 200, Mainland 135

Statistics: 1,675 transactions, 530 on the 7th

The Japanese yarn market also rose sharply, taking the same steps as our yarn. The opening price of 20 strands of Yueqin for this month was 490 yuan, rising to 96 yuan. It was slightly weak in the middle, falling by 6 yuan. The closing price rebounded by 3 yuan to 492 yuan and 3 yuan. Actual transactions were flat, but people were unanimously bullish.

### Cotton Procurement: Yong'an is Uniquely Strong, Japanese Factories have Shown Decline

The transaction of Chinese and foreign cotton is still smooth. The Yong'an Factory purchased the most, imported 450 pieces of Tongzhou American cotton packed flowers, with an exchange rate of 133 yuan, and imported 1,500 pieces of Indian cotton coarse and fine raw materials. Other Chinese factories did not have large appetites, and only Yufeng Factory purchased 400 pieces. The reason is that Japanese factories have received a lot of goods for several days. As for the silver funds, they are not able to plan for it for a while. Secondly, most of the goods in the hands of the shops have been sold for more than half, and the funds have become loose. Therefore, there is a temporary rest. The source of Subei has decreased, and only 58 packages of Tonghua have arrived. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

Another news is that the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been expensive recently because most of the hand goods have been absorbed by Japanese factories. Now, because of the tightening of exchange rates, those who have inventories in the same industry have raised prices. The raw materials that can spin 20 strands are asking for more than 150 yuan, which is not known to the factory. It is planned to use the method of reducing labor to remedy the excessive selling price of raw cotton. This method is said to be in the planning, and the transaction of foreign cotton will be hit by then.

Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton cloth, early in the morning, the Indian Mumbai telegram number rose first, short sellers covered, speculators took the opportunity to buy, the market price rose because of the purchase of the same industry and short selling continued to cover, but most traders were on the sidelines, waiting for the US government's cotton production estimate report to be released today. At the close, cotton prices were quite firm, 5-6 pounds higher than the previous day. According to estimates of cotton production released today by various industries, it is predicted to be 1,542,000 bales. Yesterday, India's forecast rose by 2 rupees, and Egypt fell by more than 10 pounds.

### Piece Goods: Colored Cloth and Woolen Cloth Rise Several Times a Day, Dragon Head Fine Cloth Jumps One Yuan

National Cloth

Foreign exchange continues to tighten, and all kinds of cloth have reached new highs. White goods, coarse cloth, and coarse twill have increased by 3-5 jiao. Fine cloth and fine twill have increased by 1 jiao 3 jiao to 7-8 jiao. Colored cloth and woolen cloth have risen several times a day, and the evening market is especially firm. Very few sellers offer prices. The most transactions are in this street, including more than 500 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, colored cloth, and woolen cloth. The Hong Kong and Nanyang gangs have traded more than 3,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, printed cloth, and ramie yarn, more than 100 bales of fine twill. The Guangdong and Ningbo gangs have added more than 100 boxes of colored twill, blue cloth, and serge. The retail business in this street is declining, and the appetite is weak.

Eastern Piece Goods

New cloth and new twill are in short supply, and the rising trend continues. Dragon head fine cloth jumps by one yuan per piece. The futures price for September has been set at 19 yuan per piece, and the spot price is 18 yuan 5 jiao. The goods for this month are 18 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen. Yanghe fine twill is priced at 16 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, and continues to rise by 5 jiao. Japanese firms have opened more than 400 pieces of trumpet, double fish, dragon head, and other brands of fine cloth for spot futures. The morning market price for dragon head in September opened at 18 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, and continued to open at 19 yuan in the afternoon. Trumpet fine cloth opened from 16 yuan 5 jiao to 17 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen, and double fish fine cloth opened from 16 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen to 17 yuan, with each step becoming tighter. Therefore, the industry predicts that the saying that high-end fine cloth will be sold for 20 yuan per piece may be realized.

Export

On the 9th, 8 pieces of piece goods were exported to Hong Kong, 18 pieces to Xiamen, 6 pieces to Haikou, 80 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 17 pieces to Yantai, 135 pieces to Tianjin, and 20 pieces to Singapore.

### Grain: Rice Transactions Mostly Off-Market

Du Rice: Although the rice shops in the market mutually persuaded each other to trade within the limit, only the goods that are not restricted and seem to be constrained are slightly opened. However, it is heard that off-market transactions are more lively, and off-market prices are rising again. It is said that if the Gao Hou japonica has opened at around 25 yuan, it will also be at 23-24 yuan sooner or later. Special Nanjing pointed rice is 21 yuan 5 jiao, and Zhongguan Wu pointed rice is 18 yuan 5 jiao. Gao Bi pointed rice also wants 17 yuan. Because it is an off-market transaction, it is impossible for us to investigate. As for those opened in the market, Dongshuang is 22 yuan, Ben Nuo is 25 yuan, and Yang Nuo is 14 yuan. According to the previous price, all have risen by a yuan. According to statistics, the number of transactions inside and outside the market is no less than 10,000 dans, and the source of each road has become increasingly scarce. Only 7-800 packages of No. 7 bus wheels have arrived at Hexia.

Ke Xian: Yesterday's market suddenly showed a chaotic atmosphere. Because the rice shops need to have a greedy stomach after guarding for three days, and although the lifting of the ban has been rumored, it can only be confirmed when the goods arrive. When the japonica pointed rice is rising, Gaojing Xian has raised the price to 21 yuan 5 jiao, and Gao Wu Xian also needs more than 21 yuan. Only a small number of pre-determined rice and brown rice are within the 16 yuan limit. 1,500-1,600 packages were opened in the open and off-market, and the off-market price rose by 6-7 jiao to nearly a yuan.

Yang Rice: There was no formal market yesterday. The new Saigon rice that was previously quoted at 26 yuan 5 jiao was quoted as high as 27 yuan 5 jiao yesterday, and it is said that it is not willing to sell in large quantities.

### Wheat is Expensive, Foot Powder is Actively Sold by the Northern Gang

The current powder is strong, and retail transactions are active. However, the Beiyang gang's request to sell the whole ticket is still rejected by the factory. As a result, in addition to entertaining the car and boat brand powder of about 20,000 bags, 15,000 bags of red God of Wealth No. 4 powder were also opened, at a price of 5 yuan 9 jiao for exchange. Other local streets and mainland scattered gangs purchased more than 20,000 bags. No. 2 powder is still open at 5 yuan 5 jiao cash. In the midst of the rising price of wheat, the factories' willingness to sell is becoming stronger, and the customers of the big gangs are temporarily restricted.

The rising trend of wheat prices has not stopped. Because the production price has been rising recently, the arrival of goods has been reduced, and the factories need it very much. The hoarders are also releasing prices to absorb, and the brokers are all hoarding. Half of it is due to the rising prices of rice and other goods. The Tongshi is selling Jingzhen Changdan and Pudong wheat with more than 30 cars in succession. It is estimated that Fuxin and Fufeng factories have purchased 13 cars, and the rest are purchased by the local street dealers. The highest price has reached 8 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen, which is another 2-3 jiao higher than the previous day.

### North and South Goods: Xu Kuizi Offers New Products

The black melon seeds are now in the transitional period between the old and the new. It is found that Xu Kuizi saw the new products the earliest. It is now known that a small number of them have arrived in Shanghai, with a total of only 6 packages. The big ones are today, you can see the samples, and the first plate will definitely be higher.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Rise Again

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a tightening of foreign exchange again, and the exchange rate was increased again, so the market continued to trend upwards. According to the Dutch telegram, the recovery price for September is 6.50 Dutch shields. The current price of 24 coarse white spot is 8 jiao 5 fen, 30 yuan and 5 jiao for this wharf, 34 yuan and 3 jiao for the foreign wharf, 8 jiao for transit goods, and a total of 500 packages were transacted at 26 yuan. Taikoo carriage white rose by a yuan, B mark on the west wharf 39 yuan and 6 jiao 100 packages, east 39 yuan and 4-5 jiao, a total of 400 packages, CW mark on the west wharf 39 yuan and 3 jiao, CX mark 39 yuan, DY mark 38 yuan and 7 jiao east wharf 5 jiao, HX mark 38 yuan and 3 jiao west wharf 5 jiao, H mark carriage red 23 yuan 5 jiao, Dutch red spot rose by 9 jiao to 29 yuan and 4 jiao, transit rose by 6 jiao to 22 yuan and 6 jiao, this cotton white rose by a yuan and a half, Zhenji No. 1 is 35 yuan, No. 2 is 34 yuan and a half, No. 3 is 34 yuan, No. 4 is 33 yuan and a half, domestic sugar is also trending firm, Huizhou white high goods opened to 41 yuan, and it was decided to be 40 yuan to 39 yuan and a half. 39 yuan and 38 yuan 4 jiao, a total of more than 600 packages were transacted.

### Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Situation Turns Stable

Soybean oil has been manipulated by powerful people, and the price has moved towards a high point. However, the rising trend has turned stable yesterday. Because the transactions in the past three days have mostly been speculative hoarding, the actual sales have been on the sidelines. Yesterday, only 70 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were opened, at 50 yuan, and 150 barrels of Kobe barrel oil were opened, at 50 yuan and 8 jiao, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were opened, at 36 yuan and 3 jiao, and 1,000 cans of Tianjin canned oil were opened, at 47 yuan and 3 jiao to 48 yuan.

On the 8th, 500 pieces of raw oil came from Qingdao, 767 tons of soybeans were shipped to Mumbai on the 8th, 136 tons were shipped to Columbus, 400 packages were shipped to Hong Kong on the 9th, and 200 packages were shipped to Singapore.

### Transferring Diojao Fees to Relieve Refugees

— (New Dream)

Now in Shanghai, everything has to catch the early market. It is still two months until the Mid-Autumn Festival, but mooncakes have already been found on the market. Not only is eating catching the early market, but even Diojao is catching the early market. The lunar July has not yet begun, but some people in the city have already launched Diojao.

Shanghai's Diojao is based on alleys as units. In each alley or street, someone launches a decision to fight for a Taiping Gong Diojao. Perhaps there are even wealthier families who fight a decision to fight for Diojao alone. In addition to inviting monks or Taoists to chant scriptures, you also have to buy tin foil, paper figures, paper objects, and everything else. It costs at least tens of yuan to fight for Diojao for a day, or even more than 100 yuan. There are also hundreds of yuan, depending on the size of the scale. The entire Shanghai has countless alleys. For Diojao, a large amount of consumption is quite alarming.

In Chinese customs, July is a season for ghosts, just like Qingming. For the sake of ghosts, I don't know how much money will be spent. For the sake of Diojao, monks and Taoists are embarking on a lucky journey, too busy to cope. Each temple or lower courtyard, etc., does not know how much money it will earn in July. At the same time, in paper shops, each family is busy making paper gods, paper ghosts, and other Diojao things. It is said that no matter which paper shop, the business done in July is more than the combined total of the other eleven months of the year. Therefore, the Daoban people, after a year has begun, hope for this Diojao month in July.

Probably the so-called public Diojao, etc., are initiated by those who watch the alleys, playboys, etc. For one or a combination of several alleys, money is donated from house to house. Unless they are believers, ordinary families will generously take out Diojao donations of a few jiao or even one or two yuan every year, without any stinginess. Although there is a reimbursement account written on yellow paper afterwards and posted in a place where everyone can see it, the initiator is also able to scrape a lot of oil from it. Everyone knows what the purpose of these people initiating Diojao is, unless they are fools.

Since Diojao is a superstition, especially when the standard of living is high to the sky, this huge consumption seems to be avoidable. The call for frugality has been resounding like thunder. If this Diojao fee cannot be saved, then there is no need to discuss other consumption. Therefore, as the Diojao season is about to begin, Mr. Jin Zongcheng, the manager of the New New Company, advocates transferring the Diojao fee to relieve refugees. Following this, the city's Relief and Disaster Relief Committee also appealed to all sectors of society to stop fighting Diojao and use the Diojao expenses to relieve refugees.

Indeed, if the money spent by all the people in Shanghai for Diojao is used to relieve refugees, it can save many refugees, which is much more practical than spending money on ghosts and gods in vain. Therefore, the author sincerely hopes that urban residents will use the money for Diojao to save refugees. This will not only eliminate old customs, but also allow refugees to be relieved. What could be more delightful?

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 14: Thousands of Families of Fireworks, Rural Cooperation, Thousands of Miles of Waves, Prayers, Flying Overseas

There is one more thing: please ask my father to appoint a general manager from among the shareholders. A snake cannot move without a head. With a general manager, everything can be done according to the order. These few things were all decided after they returned to Anle Town from the Free Village and wrote to their father. It is pitiful that these two sisters discussed until midnight every day in Dr. Zhang's house. Originally, people in Dr. Zhang's house get up very early and go to bed very early at night. When it came to the ten o'clock chain at night, almost everyone in the house turned off the lights and went to sleep. But Chu Zhu's lover said to them: "We have to get up early tomorrow morning to go to the hospital, so we have to go to bed early. But you don't have to get up as soon as it dawns tomorrow. You don't have to be bound by this. If you want to discuss something or draft something harmful, feel free to do so. Moreover, it is more peaceful at night, and it is most suitable to write something at night. You know me, I like to write things at night the most. But now there is no way, but you don't have to be bound by us going to bed early. You can stay up all night if you want." But although the lover said so, they were afraid of disturbing others, and even spoke in a low voice, not daring to speak loudly. The lover knew this, and specially prepared some dry snacks or the best biscuits for them. If not, they asked the kitchen to cook chicken porridge for them, knowing that they Cantonese people like to eat late-night snacks. However, she herself slept her own sleep and would not accompany them. Who knew that on Wednesday, the two Miss He received a telegram from their father from Beiping. The telegram said: "Father is ordered by the International Trade Council and will be traveling to Xinjiang soon. Please forward the telegram to mother and brother. Regarding the silk weaving factory, the shareholders want the two children to be fully responsible and intend to appoint Shuang'er as manager and Bian'er as engineer. Before starting the business, Li can fly to Europe and the United States for inspection, for a period of one month. Please also handle the construction of factory buildings and other matters. Uncle Jiang Jing will return to the South and arrive in Shanghai on Monday, staying at the International Hotel. He is also one of the shareholders and has experience in running silk weaving factories. You can visit him, and the funds will also be remitted by him." The two Miss He were naturally satisfied with such a telegram from their father. But everything has to be busy, and it is still necessary to teach Shuangyu to be the manager. Shuangyu said: "I can't do this. We are newcomers and have no experience at all. How can we be managers?" Liyu wanted to comfort her and said: "Don't worry! Anyway, Uncle Jiang is coming to Shanghai. He has been the manager of a certain silk weaving company. We can ask him to take the position." It is true:

Just intending to go on a long journey together, suddenly hearing the news that the returning geese are here. (168)

### Do Not Buy Rice Above the Price Limit

— Nan

The prices in Shanghai have recently taken off, and the cost of living has at least doubled, making it extremely difficult for the general salaried class, who calculate where to save and where to save every day, but still find it difficult to make ends meet.

Recently, the concession authorities have limited the price of rice to a maximum of 20 yuan per dan, and have adopted strict measures to effectively maintain this price limit. This regulation is for the benefit of the public, and we should work harder to help implement it. However, violations have recently been discovered.

Yesterday, a friend bought a dan of rice, and the price was 20 yuan and 4 jiao, but the invoice showed 20 yuan. I felt very strange and asked my friend why he was obviously losing out? His wife said: "In this way, the weight can be more sufficient, and the quality of the rice can be better." Later, after asking several families, most of them had the same situation.

In this kind of under-the-table transaction, the buyer may think that he is not losing out, or that he can even get a little cheaper, but its impact is very large. Because this kind of under-the-table transaction exists, it will definitely rise slowly, and eventually the current price limit will not be able to be maintained, causing everyone to suffer. We should unanimously and firmly refuse to buy rice above the price limit, and not give merchants the opportunity to profit for the sake of a little personal gain; and if there are stores that raise rice prices, we should immediately report them and let them be sanctioned by the public.

At the same time, I hope that the rice merchants in the concession will not do things that are unconscionable, betray their compatriots, and betray the country for the sake of a small profit.

### Regarding the 400,000 Yuan Stamps

(1) Hope to Recover as Much as Possible According to the Old Banknote Example

After reading "400,000 Yuan Stamps," I feel that this issue does need to be discussed. According to the results of my conversation with several cigarette exchange shops today, the listed exchange rate has actually increased from 1 yuan to 110 points, 120 points, and has been raised to 130 points and 140 points. However, there is a greater difficulty in this bidding. Those who list 110 points and 120 points are of course taking in too many stamps and are sacrificing them to absorb legal tender. Those who list 130 points and 140 points are sacrificing so much that it is almost one-third strong. The profits of the cigarette exchange shops are indeed generous, but they will not be higher than 30%. Under such a sacrifice, it is inevitable that they will suffer extremely large losses in their operations. However, they still grit their teeth and sacrifice. Since stamps have been used to replace fen coins, it is inevitable that they will be damaged, stained, and degummed due to repeated transmission. At this time, the postal bureau is issuing notices prohibiting the use of damaged stamps and prohibiting the use of fragmented stamps for sending letters to other places and registered letters. Now that fen coins are about to be shipped to Shanghai, these damaged stamps will naturally not be worth half a penny in hand. Therefore, rather than suffering a greater loss of total annihilation in the future, it is better to get rid of them as soon as possible. Those who exchange 1 yuan for 130 points and 140 points are all these damaged one-fen stamps.

400,000 yuan—how will this huge amount be disposed of after the issuance of fen coins?

The post office is a state agency. First, we naturally ask to recover as much as possible according to the old banknote example. If it is indeed impossible, then we hope to accept the second request:

That the two notices, "Prohibiting the Use of Damaged Stamps" and "Prohibiting the Use of Fragmented Stamps for Sending Letters to Other Places and Registered Letters," can be temporarily suspended or have an appropriate time limit.

This is our minimum expectation. It would be even better if the authorities could have a more comprehensive approach. — (Su Chen)

(2) Hope that Various Groups and Organizations Will Contribute Methods

After reading Mr. Xin Meng's "400,000 Yuan Stamps," I believe that this issue urgently needs a proper solution so that this matter can be resolved reasonably. Then, not only will the general peddlers and merchants benefit a lot, but it can also eliminate many disputes caused by stamps in society.

I first propose to request the Shanghai Postal Authority to immediately recover the stamps circulating in the city, regardless of damage or disrepair, within a time limit after the central fen coins are issued. The procedures and methods should be formulated in detail separately.

I also hope that before the central fen coins arrive in Shanghai, the postal authorities should first issue an announcement to reassure the public and avoid the chaos in the market during the transition period. This is a matter of vital interest to the 5 million citizens of the city. I hope the wise postal authorities will pay close attention.

The above two points may also be a unanimous request from the citizens of Shanghai. I hope that enthusiastic and powerful people from all walks of life, as well as groups and organizations such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Taxpayer Chinese Association, will provide as many high opinions and contribute methods as possible, and immediately contact the postal authorities to resolve this serious problem as soon as possible, which will greatly benefit the common people. — (Jue Fen)

### Announcement

The total amount of the May issue's charity sale contribution fee is 27 yuan and 9 jiao. The detailed list has been published in this issue on June 25. For the sake of saving procedures, the total amount (the detailed lists of each issue have been published separately) will be sent to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in conjunction with Ziyoutan, the entertainment industry, children, and clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The receipts No. 400 and No. 402 of the Bank of China and the remittance number No. 31 of the Bank of Communications Yu Tiao have been drawn, and are now stored in the editorial office. This is a public announcement.

In addition, next to the advertising of the Jingcheng Grand Theater in this month's issue, there is a text similar to the text layout format of this publication, describing "poverty," which is also an advertisement and not a manuscript from this publication. This is a special statement. Chunqiu Editorial Office

### Does the Soul Really Exist? (Continued)

— Zhu

(1) Things unseen do exist! If you say that what is unseen is nonexistent, then aside from a few specialists, most of us have never seen air and electricity. However, we know they exist by observing their actions! A former atheist once said, "I have performed many surgeries, and I have never seen a soul in the human body." At that time, a Christian asked him, "Doctor, do you love your wife?" The doctor replied, "Of course, I love her." The Christian said, "Please show me your love." The doctor was left speechless. Ladies and gentlemen, since you know that love exists even though it is unseen, and emotions exist, the soul is the same. Although it cannot be seen, it certainly exists. (2) The human form is different from that of birds and beasts! The forms of birds and beasts are turned away from the sun and moon, their heads toward the ground, with no hope beyond finding food on the ground. This is because they have no soul, and death is the end. However, we humans are very different from birds and beasts. Therefore, the human form has its head toward the sun and moon, face toward the sky, not solely seeking earthly food as satisfaction. We also seek eternal heavenly blessings for the soul! Earthly possessions can never satisfy your and my hearts. Unfortunately, many people in modern times are misled by materialism, believing that worldly pleasures are enough! They no longer pursue the eternal comfort, hope, peace, joy, vitality, and heavenly blessings of the spirit. Such people pride themselves on being successful, but their conscience is damaged; they are pitiful people, not much different from birds and beasts. I hope dear readers will not repeat their mistakes, but find a way out for the soul.

### Once a Year　Double Seventh Festival　"A Match Across the Milky Way" Performed

— Yan Yan

Celestial World and Mortal Realm　Cowherd and Weaver Girl

(Beiping Theater News) During every auspicious festival, the Peking opera world customarily presents plays appropriate to the occasion. The "Match Across the Milky Way" on the Double Seventh Festival is one of these. With this year's Double Seventh Festival approaching, theaters across Beiping will stage this play to add to the festive atmosphere. It is expected that this year's "Match Across the Milky Way" will be grander than in previous years. Based on what I have heard, the reports are as follows:

Xun Huisheng: After a month-long summer break, he is scheduled to appear on stage on the Double Seventh Festival. He will perform "Match Across the Milky Way" at the Jixiang Theater that evening. The following evening, he will also perform this play at the Chang'an Theater to celebrate the festival. Xun will play the Weaver Girl, and Jin Zhong will play the Cowherd.

Shang Xiaoyun: She performs "Match Across the Milky Way" every Double Seventh Festival. It is expected that she will perform it at least three times this year. Shang himself will play the Weaver Girl, and Shang Fuxia will play the Cowherd.

Xiao Cuihua: This year, she plans to cross-dress as the Cowherd and is actively preparing for it. The role of the Weaver Girl has not yet been decided.

Huang Yulin: After a month-long summer break, he is scheduled to appear on stage at the Chang'an Theater before the Double Seventh Festival, performing "Match Across the Milky Way." He will play the Weaver Girl himself, or Zhou Weijun will play the Cowherd.

Mao Shilai: He is also scheduled to perform "Match Across the Milky Way" during the day on the Double Seventh Festival, playing the Weaver Girl himself, with Chen Shengtai playing the Cowherd.

Zhao Jinrong: After a recent summer break, she will perform "Match Across the Milky Way" at the Xulan Garden, completely in the style of Mei Lanfang. The performance date has not yet been determined. Jinrong will play the Weaver Girl, or Jiang Miaoxiang will play the Weaver Girl.

Zhao Xiaolan: This year, he has also decided to cross-dress as the Cowherd, with the painted-face Li Chunheng cross-dressing as the Weaver Girl. A double cross-dressing performance is expected to be even more sensational than Xiao Cuihua's.

Li Wanchun: As is customary every year, he will perform "Match Across the Milky Way" several times. It seems to have been decided that he will perform at the Qingle Theater on the evening of the Double Seventh Festival. Wanchun will play the Cowherd himself, and Gu Yulan will take on the role of the Weaver Girl.

Fu Liancheng Society: This year, the role of the Weaver Girl has been decided and will still be played by Liu Wutong. The role of the Cowherd has not yet been determined. It is expected that this play will be performed more than five times this year.

Drama School: Four people are planned for both the Cowherd and Weaver Girl roles, including Yuan Jinkai, Tan Jinhui, Zhao Jinnian, and Li Yuru (cross-dressing) playing the Cowherd, and Bai Yuwei, Li Yuru, Li Jinhong, and Zhao Jinnian (cross-dressing) playing the Weaver Girl. It is expected that it will also be performed more than five times.

Rongchun Society: This year, various lantern decorations and building blocks have new designs. The roles have mostly been decided, but the final decision is still pending. The number of performances will likely be the highest among all troupes, possibly exceeding ten times.

In addition, troupes such as Xu Dongming, Li Yanxiu, Hua Huishi, Xu Yanhua, Xu Wen, Lü Ranxiang, Liang Yunqiu, and Xian Ruifang also have plans to perform "Match Across the Milky Way." As for Cheng Yanqiu, he never performs this play, so it is unlikely that he will make an exception this year. Troupes such as Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Xi Xiaobo, Sun Yukun, Liu Zongyang, and Ma Yunqiao are either laosheng troupes or wusheng troupes and do not perform "Match Across the Milky Way."

Diao Ban is waiting to give birth, and the scenes for Princess Daizhan in "Wang Baochuan" have been rushed.

### Johnny Weissmuller Returns to the Screen

— Fengxiang

MGM Signs a Seven-Year Contract　"Chinese Tarzan" to Compete for Popularity

The story of "Tarzan of the Apes" has long been a household name, but "Tarzan" only appeared on the screen in 1918. Elmo Lincoln was the first to take on this important role. In subsequent remakes, the role has been played by about twelve different actors, but only four have made a lasting impression on audiences. These four are Johnny Weissmuller, Buster Crabbe, Herman Brix, and Glenn Morris. Among them, Weissmuller, who won the swimming championship at the World Games, is the most famous.

Weissmuller had previously made many "Tarzan of the Apes" films for MGM in Hollywood, such as "Tarzan the Ape Man" in 1932, "Tarzan and His Mate" in 1934, and "Tarzan Escapes" in 1936. Recently, MGM signed a new seven-year long-term contract with him, and it has been decided that he will return to Hollywood immediately after completing his swimming program at the World's Fair on October 31 this year to shoot the new film "Tarzan in Exile." Fans must be delighted by this news.

Furthermore, there was news from Hong Kong that our Chinese strongman Peng Fei would be filming "Chinese Tarzan" and had once come to Shanghai to invite the actress Li Hong to co-star. However, because Li Hong had contractual obligations and could not spare the time, it had to be abandoned, and Li Zhuolai was invited to play the main role instead. At that time, it may be worth seeing the "Chinese Tarzan" and "Foreign Tarzan" compete for popularity on the screen.

### Molière and "The School for Wives"

— Zhe

In the past six months, Molière's plays have been very popular in Shanghai: in mid-March, the Sino-French Drama School performed "Les Précieuses Ridicules," and not long ago, the Hujiang Literary Society and the New Drama Society performed "Tartuffe." From this point of view, Molière's comedies are being welcomed by the general audience. The reason they like Molière's works is that Molière's comedies are a representation of social reality and a proactive exposure of it.

Molière was a great French comedian of the seventeenth century, and his position in French drama is just like Shakespeare's in England. Molière's works have a high degree of timelessness, full of vitality, and can attract countless audiences in any corner of the world. Molière produced his comedies with a serious attitude, and what he expressed were the weaknesses of society and the shortcomings of humanity in his time. He selected common types from the surrounding life to create the characters in his comedies. The humor in Molière's comedies is not simply emotional but objectively and rationally funny.

"The School for Wives" is Molière's work from 1662, originally named "L'École des Femmes." It has now been adapted into a three-act Chinese play by Mr. Sun Zhang. The content is roughly like this: Mr. Arnolphe is a gilded man and someone who has stumbled countless times in the whirlpool of love. Marriages and divorces in Europe and America, as well as the kind of unions that value love but not chastity, make him afraid to try easily. In addition, he has always been defeated in the field of love, which inevitably makes him feel apprehensive about marriage.

But he is over forty years old, and after being well-fed and warm, he finally thinks about marriage again. Therefore, because he wants to marry but is dissatisfied with the women of the present, he has no choice but to turn his thoughts and create a so-called "ideal" "wife" to achieve his surreal "ideal." Sure enough, according to his foolish theory, he sought out a naive, unspoiled girl from a poor rural woman in Wuxi and placed her in a small nunnery for a slave education.

As a result, when he returned after going to Wuxi for ten days, the situation had changed. The girl was madly in love with the son of his friend Zhen Qing. Later, many unexpected relationships were discovered, and finally, by a twist of fate, they entered into a happy marriage. As for Mr. Arnolphe, since he looks down on women, is not at ease with women, and is afraid of women, well, he can only remain a widower for the rest of his life.

When Molière performed "The School for Wives" in 1662, the audience could not appreciate the advantages of the play and received many random criticisms, especially from noble women, who felt that the story was deliberately insulting them. Molière was angered by their bad reviews, so he wrote another play, "La Critique de l'École des Femmes," which premiered in 1663 and was unexpectedly welcomed by society. However, at that time, a Duke of La Feuillade thought that a certain character in the play was referring to him, so he was greatly angered and tried to retaliate. Finally, one day, Molière suffered a great insult when the Duke of La Feuillade rubbed his face with a copper button until it bled. Although this is an anecdote in Molière's theatrical history, it also shows Molière's intolerance of society and his indomitable spirit of exposure.

(Editor's note: The Sino-French Drama Society's next performance after "The Wilderness" is "The School for Wives," directed by Shu Yan. The play has already been rehearsed, but according to the news received yesterday, it may be changed. What play will be performed instead is unknown and will be reported later.)

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

At the break of dawn, the staff guides the performer to the pre-arranged location, meets with those who are enticing the performer away, gets into a sedan car, lowers the curtain, and the driver cracks the whip. In less than half an hour, they have traveled dozens of miles. By the time the theater owner discovers this, it is impossible to track them down. Once these people arrive at their destination, the person who enticed the performer away will certainly receive a special reward. At the same time, when the whole city hears that a certain performer has been enticed from a certain theater, it is simply considered an amazing event. Once they appear on stage, they are bound to cause a sensation. The audience always feels that the performer's skills must be a hundred times better than those who joined the troupe on their own. This has become a habit. Even if a performer joins on their own later, the theater owner will also announce that the performer was enticed from somewhere. This has become so common that the term "enticing performers" was a very popular phrase in inland theaters in the past. Nowadays, with convenient transportation, famous performers all have their own costumes. Secretly enticing performers has changed to publicly inviting them. Advertisements are placed in the newspapers in advance, and after an agreement is reached, a special person is sent to pick them up. On the day of departure, dozens of trunks of costumes are transported, accompanied by several supporting actors and more than a dozen attendants, creating a grand and imposing scene like an army setting out, fearing that not enough people know about it. Compared to the past, when famous performers carried small bundles on their backs, secretly rode in mule carts at night, and eloped with the person who enticed them away, there is a vast difference. The changes between now and then are amazing, but the difference in the hardships and joys of the performers is also very great. I hope that today's famous performers will not be too arrogant, so that the former performers will not feel resentful.
